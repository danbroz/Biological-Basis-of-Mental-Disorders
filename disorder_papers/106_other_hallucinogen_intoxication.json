      "title": "Delirium",
      "abstract": "The word “delirium” is synonymous with these terms: acute confusional state, encephalopathy, toxic or metabolic encephalopathy, organic mental syndrome, organic psychosis, and toxic psychosis. Delirium is a constellation of signs and symptoms that definitively indicate the presence of an underlying physical disorder. Delirium, however, is a nonspecific syndrome; it does not point to a particular underlying etiology. Rather, a myriad of possible medical disorders and/or physical factors, alone or in combination, are capable of producing delirium. The three cardinal signs and symptoms of delirium are: clouding of consciousness, impaired attention, and altered states of arousal (hyperarousal or hypo-arousal). Secondary features of delirium include: global impairment of cognition; disturbances of speech articulation (not of language); hallucinations and illusions; fluctuating affect; psychotic symptoms, such as delusions, illusions, hallucinations, and paranoid ideation; and disturbances in the sleep/wake cycle.",

      "title": "Hallucinogen-Related Disorders",
      "abstract": "The hallucinogens are a class of psychoactive drugs, either synthetic or plant products, that produce auditory and/or visual hallucinations as well as thought, mood, and perceptual changes. Depending on dosage, expectation (set), and environment (setting), they also can induce euphoria and a state similar to a transcendental experience. These hallucinations can be present as part of a delirium (e.g., from jimsonweed [ Datura stramonium ]) when accompanied by disturbances in judgment, orientation, intellect, memory, and emotion. Delirium also can result from drug withdrawal (e.g., associated with sedative-hypnotic and/or alcohol withdrawal). When used in the context of substance abuse, the term hallucinogen generally refers to a compound that alters consciousness without producing delirium, sedation, excessive stimulation, or impairment of intellect or memory. Hallucinogens that are abused include the prototype hallucinogen d -lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD); other indolealkylamines such as psilocybin (\"magic mushrooms\") and dimethyltryptamine (DMT, also contained in the South American beverage ayahuasca); and the phenalkylamines, including mescaline and dimethoxymethylamphetamine (DOM, also called STP). LSD, DMT, DOM, psilocybin, and mescaline are sometimes characterized as serotonergic hallucinogens on account of their predominant effect on that receptor system. Other plant products with hallucinogenic activity that are abused include the seeds of the morning glory ( Ipomoea ), which contain lysergic acid derivatives, and seeds of the Hawaiian baby woodrose ( Argyreia nervosa ), which contain lysergic acid amide. Cannabinoid agonists; ≡ agonists; antimuscarinic agents; dissociative anesthetics such as phencyclidine (PCP); and designer drugs such as methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or ecstasy), which are sometimes classified as hallucinogens, are covered elsewhere in this volume.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Hallucinogens, also known as psychedelics, are a broad range of agents that alter perception in different ways. These include phenylethylamines (e.g., ecstasy), ergot alkaloids (e.g., lysergic acid diethylamide, or LSD), tryptamines (e.g., psilocybin), anticholinergics (e.g., jimsonweed), and terpenoids (e.g., salvinorin). Dissociative anesthetics—including phencyclidine (PCP) and ketamine—are a related class of drugs that share many characteristics. Hallucinogen use is highest among young adults; MDMA is the most commonly used agent, followed by LSD and PCP. There appear to be few serious lasting complications associated with hallucinogen use. There are few data on treatment of individuals who use hallucinogens or dissociatives.",

They consist of a vision of small people, occasionally accompanied by animals or by other objects of minute size. These phenomena have nothing to do with micropsy. The hallucinations are usually multiple, mobile and of bright color. The patient sometimes hears the small people speaking with a \"lilliputian\" voice. The hallucinations are usually associated with a pleasant state of mind, rarely having an unpleasant or terrifying effect on the patient. Lilliputian hallucinations have occurred in the most varied conditions: arteriosclerosis, senile psychosis, alcoholic psychosis and most of the toxic and toxi-infectious states (typhoid, cholera, erysipelas, pneumonia, purulent pluerisy, etc.). They are observed occasionally in dreams and in the hypnagogic state. Various drugs—ether, cocaine, alcohol, hashish, hyoscine,<sup>2</sup>caffeine citrate<sup>3</sup>—can produce lilliputian hallucinations. Few cases of lilliputian hallucinations have been reported in the literature on schizophrenia.",

      "title": "Functional (Psychogenic) Cognitive Disorders: A Perspective from the Neurology Clinic",
      "abstract": "Cognitive symptoms such as poor memory and concentration represent a common cause of morbidity among patients presenting to general practitioners and may result in referral for a neurological opinion. In many cases, these symptoms do not relate to an underlying neurological disease or dementia. In this article we present a personal perspective on the differential diagnosis of cognitive symptoms in the neurology clinic, especially as this applies to patients who seek advice about memory problems but have no neurological disease process. These overlapping categories include the following 'functional' categories: 1) cognitive symptoms as part of anxiety or depression; 2) \"normal\" cognitive symptoms that become the focus of attention; 3) isolated functional cognitive disorder in which symptoms are outwith 'normal' but not explained by anxiety; 4) health anxiety about dementia; 5) cognitive symptoms as part of another functional disorder; and 6) retrograde dissociative (psychogenic) amnesia. Other 'non-dementia' diagnoses to consider in addition are 1) cognitive symptoms secondary to prescribed medication or substance misuse; 2) diseases other than dementia causing cognitive disorders; 3) patients who appear to have functional cognitive symptoms but then go on to develop dementia/another neurological disease; and finally 4) exaggeration/malingering. We discuss previous attempts to classify the problem of functional cognitive symptoms, the importance of making a positive diagnosis for the patient, and the need for large cohort studies to better define and manage this large group of patients.",

      "title": "Treating Catatonia: a Blind Spot of Psychiatry?",
      "abstract": "Catatonia is a syndrome of primarily psychomotor disturbances associated with typical abnormalities of muscle tone. It is characterized by the co-occurrence of several symptoms of decreased, increased, or abnormal psychomotor activity. Catatonia is a neuropsychiatric syndrome, not an independent nosological entity. Historically associated mainly with schizophrenia (e.g., catatonic subtype), ICD-11, similarly to DSM-5, now recognizes catatonia under a separate classification category, apart from psychotic disorders. In addition to schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders, it can occur in the context of other mental disorders, such as mood disorders, or neurodevelopmental disorders, especially autism spectrum disorder. Catatonia can also develop during or immediately after intoxication or withdrawal from psychoactive substances, including phencyclidine, cannabis, hallucinogens such as mescaline or LSD, cocaine and MDMA or related drugs, or during the use of some psychoactive and non-psychoactive medications (e.g. antipsychotic medications, benzodiazepines, steroids, disulfiram, ciprofloxacin). Moreover, catatonia can occur as a direct pathophysiological consequence of various nonpsychiatric medical conditions, e.g., diabetic ketoacidosis, hypercalcemia, hepatic encephalopathy, homocystinuria, neoplasms head trauma, cerebrovascular disease, or encephalitis. Due to the fact that catatonia was mostly associated witch schizophrenia, many cases were not diagnosed and thus did not receive indicated treatment. There are no specific “anti-catatonic” drugs, first-line treatment are benzodiazepines and ECT, in addition to the symptomatic and supportive therapy. The recognition of catatonia as an independent category in ICD-11 can improve medical care for catatonic patients in clinical practice. Disclosure No significant relationships.",

      "title": "Prise en charge symptomatique : neurologique, respiratoire, hémodynamique et hépatique des intoxications graves par médicaments et substances illicites",
      "abstract": "La prise en charge des défaillances vitales est une urgence ; elle ne doit pas être retardée par la réalisation d'examens complémentaires ni par un traitement évacuateur et/ou épurateur. Les troubles neurologiques sont très fréquents au cours des intoxications par médicaments ou produits illicites (coma, encéphalopathies, convulsions, mouvements anormaux). Il n'existe pas de corrélation entre leur intensité et la sévérité de l'intoxication. La gravité immédiate d'un coma d'origine toxique est liée à sa profondeur. Mais la gravité potentielle et donc le pronostic final dépendent du mécanisme de toxicité et des complications associées. Le traitement symptomatique des manifestations neurologiques est une urgence et une prise en charge médicalisée précoce des patients inconscients est recommandée. Les complications respiratoires dues à l'altération de la conscience (dépression respiratoire centrale, obstruction mécanique des voies aériennes supérieures, pneumopathie d'inhalation, SDRA) sont fréquentes au cours des intoxications médicamenteuses et peuvent altérer le pronostic d'intoxications a priori bénignes. La prise en charge des complications respiratoires comporte peu d'éléments spécifiques à l'étiologie toxique et peut aller de l'observation simple aux techniques de ventilation, voire d'échanges gazeux extracorporels, les plus sophistiquées, sans que l'intérêt de ces dernières ait été validé en toxicologie. Les complications cardiovasculaires peuvent survenir de façon extrêmement précoce, ce qui justifie un transport médicalisé vers l'hôpital de tout patient intoxiqué, même chez un patient asymptomatique. Les formes à libération prolongée sont responsables d'une symptomatologie retardée et prolongée. Les mécanismes de toxicité sont souvent intriqués. La connaissance du ou des mécanismes impliqués dans un état de choc d'origine toxique est primordiale pour un traitement adapté. Il existe des spécificités de traitement des collapsus toxiques (sels molaires de bicarbonate de sodium, sels de calcium, glucagon à forte dose, insuline euglycémique) et l'indication d'une assistance circulatoire devant une intoxication par stabilisant de membrane réfractaire au traitement médical doit être discutée avant que ne survienne une défaillance multiviscérale irréversible. Les hépatites toxiques médicamenteuses sont globalement responsables de 20 % des hépatites fulminantes. En cas d'hépatite fulminante, le transfert vers un centre de transplantation doit être précoce. Management of drug-induced organ failure is a medical emergency that should not be delayed by any additional examination or attempt at decontamination. Drug-induced neurological disturbances are very frequent in acute poisonings (coma, encephalopathy, seizures, and abnormal movements). There is no correlation between their magnitude and the severity of the poisoning. The immediate severity is related to the depth of drug-induced coma. However, the outcome depends on the mechanism of toxicity as well as the occurrence of complications. Supportive treatment of neurological manifestations is a medical emergency and the early medical management of unconscious patients should be recommended. Drug-induced respiratory distress (including central respiratory depression, obstruction of the airways, aspiration pneumonia, and ARDS) is frequent in drug-induced poisoning and may alter the final outcome of non-life-threatening poisonings. Supportive treatment of drug-induced respiratory distress is rather non-specific including medical observation, mechanical ventilation, and even sophisticated methods like extracorporeal removal of CO2 whose efficiency in drug-induced poisoning remains to be determined. Drug-induced cardiovascular disturbances may occur early and abruptly. Thus, the transfer of all patients poisoned with cardiotropic drugs requires medical supervision, even in asymptomatic patients. Sustained release drugs may cause a delay in onset of sustained toxic effects. The mechanisms of toxicity are frequently associated. The precise knowledge of the different mechanisms involved in a drug-induced cardiovascular shock is mandatory for providing adequate supportive treatment. There is some specificity regarding the treatment of drug-induced cardiovascular shock including the administration of molar sodium bicarbonate, calcium salts, high-dose of glucagon, and insulin. The indication of extracorporeal life-support should be considered in case of poisonings involving membrane-stabilizing agent, refractory to conventional treatment, before the onset of irreversible multiorgan failure. Drug-induced hepatitis globally accounts for 20% of fulminant hepatitis. Fulminant hepatitis requires considering the early transfer in center specialized in liver transplantation.",

      "abstract": "조현병(정신분열병)은 망상, 환각, 와해된 언어와 행동 그리고 사회적 직업적 기능상의 심각한 어려움을 초래하는 증상 등의 특징을 지닌다. 정신장애의 진단 및 통계편람 제5판인 DSM-5에서는 조현병의 범주에서 몇 가지 중요한 변화를 보여주고 있다. - 진단기준의 하위유형(subtypes) 폐지: 하위유형은 평가 당시의 두드러진 증상으로 정의되었지만, 종종환자의 증상이 하나의 유형에서 다른 유형으로 변화되고 또한 하위유형 간 중복되는 증상을 드러내 하위유형간 구분이 분명하지 않아 이는 유형간 타당도를 저하시키는 원인이 되어 임상가에게 유용하지 않았다는 점이 그 이유이다. 한편 catatonia(운동부동증과 혼미 등)는 보다 세부적인 진단을 돕기 위한 세부진단(specifier)이 되었다. 예로, 조현병과 분열정동장애 같은 기타 정신병적 장애의 specifier specifier로 로사용되고, 양극성장애나 주요우울장애 같은 다른 장애에서도 사용될 수 있다. - 증상의 심각도(severity): 증상의 심도를 평정하는 증상의 역치(symptom threshold)는 특정 증상에서 적어도 2이상을 드러내야 한다(DSM-IV의 증상역치는 1).- 추후 연구영역: DSM-5의 Section III에 포함된 약한 정신병 증후(Attenuated psychosis syndrome)는 공식적인 장애로 고려되기 이전 더 많은 연구를 필요로 하는 조건이다. 이 잠정적 진단범주는 만개된정신병적 장애를 보이지는 않지만 가벼운 관련 증상들을 드러내는 개인들을 포함하고 있다. 추후 정신병적 장애를 드러낼 위험성이 높은 개인을 밝히는 것은 조기의 효율적인 개입에 중요한 시사점을 지닌다. 성격장애는 다양한 생활영역에서 개인의 기능에 영향을 미치는 자신과 타인에 대한 감정과 사고방식과 관련된다. DSM-5에서는 DSM-IV와 동일한 10가지 성격장애의 범주적 접근을 유지하고 있다. 한편DSM-5의 Section III에는 차원-범주 혼합모형(hybrid dimensional-categorical model)이 제안되었다. 이로써 임상가는 개인의 성격기능에서의 어려움과 성격의 병리적 특질패턴에 근거하여 성격장애의 진단과 성격을 평가할 수 있다.",

Chronic conditions such as acoustic neuroma rarely present with vertigo. Aggravating factors can be head or body position. Benign positional vertigo accounts for about half of all cases of vertigo. Associated symptoms: nausea, vomiting, fullness of ears, hearing loss, tinnitus, all of which suggest otological etiologies; headaches, diplopia, blurred vision, ataxia, paresthesia, all suggestive of central nervous system (CNS) etiologies.

These include impaired attention and concentration (often due to preoccupation with morbid or worrying thoughts); anxiety, which usually accompanies depression; irritability; agitation or retardation; fatigue after sleepless nights; and weakness due to insufficient food intake. In addition, depressed patients may take risks with little regard to the consequences, make suicidal gestures or attempts that go wrong, and take alcohol or other substances that impair functioning to relieve distress. In keeping with these considerations are the reductions in performance in tests of cognitive and psychomotor function in depressed patients.1\n\nIf depression causes or contributes to accidents in these ways then therisk of accidents might be expected to fall as the disorder improves in response to treatment with antidepressant drugs (or other treatment). On the other hand, the unwanted effects of antidepressants may adversely affect cognitive and psychomotor function (especially in those with pre-existing cerebral impairment), thereby increasing the risk of accidents. This is particularly the case in patients who do not respond to treatment and thus are impaired by both the depression and the drug. Drug induced effects may be clinically obvious, with, for example, somnolence due to oversedation; mild effects may be evident only on formal psychometric testing.

The relationship between this disorder and physical and mental health is important due to the impact that it has on the quality of life and life expectancy of those who suffer from it. Unfortunately, insomnia usually goes unnoticed or untreated, which contributes to the onset or worsening of psychiatric and medical conditions. This exacerbates the problem of insomnia in the elderly people. In relation to the treatment it is recommended: 1) the search and management of secondary causes of insomnia, 2) a non-drug therapy that includes sleep hygiene measures, 3) pharmacotherapy. It is not recommended to start a treatment with a hypnotic drug without rule out medications or diseases that cause or exacerbate insomnia. It is not recommended the use of narcoleptics, melatonin, antihistamines or long half-life benzodiazepines.

      "abstract": "Delirium Delirium is a disturbance of consciousness (awareness of the person' s environment) characterized by altered or shifting mental status and inattention (reduced ability to focus, sustain, or shift attention).There are also changes in cognition (basic mental functions) such as memory impairment, disorientation to time or place, and language disturbance.There also may be disturbances of perception (accurate appreciation of the environment) such as hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that are not actually there), abnormal speech, abnormal movements (including tremors or picking at clothing), disruptive or violent behavior, and sudden shifts in emotions.To qualify for a diagnosis of delirium, the signs and symptoms must have a short onset (over a period of hours or days) and change over the course of the day.It is important to make a clear distinction between delirium and dementia (such as Alzheimer disease).Dementia is a disturbance in intellectual (thinking) functions that is usually gradually progressive over a long period.Having delirium along with another medical illness can significantly increase a person' s chance of dying from that illness.It is important for doctors to identify delirium so that it can be treated to improve the person' s overall prognosis.The December 24/31, 2008, issue of JAMA includes an article about agitation and delirium at the end of life.This Patient Page is based on one previously published in the April 14, 2004, issue of JAMA.",

      "abstract": "Conversion disorder is the clinical situation in which one or more symptoms can present deficits that affect motor or sensory function and suggest a neurological or organic condition. Psychological factors are decisive, and they usually include a major anxiety generated by intrapsychic conflicts, which are converted by unconscious defense mechanism into symptoms. The symptoms are not intentionally provoked or simulated nor are explained by organic suffering or substance consumption. They affect the quality of life of the person who presents significant deficits such as motor, sensory, convulsive or mixed. It may also occur a lack of coordination, ataxia, paralysis, tremor, aphonia, difficulties at swallowing, loss of sensitivity, anesthesia that does not follow anatomical nervous trajectories, blindness or mental deafness. Consciousness is not altered, but a condition of \"la belle indifference\" appears which is rather associated with histrionic personality disorders and what the patients imagine about their own illness or suffering. This condition is unstable and changing. The primary gain is the expression of an unconscious psychological conflict through a somatic symptom by reducing anxiety and keeping conflict out of consciousness. The secondary gain is external and includes attention and care from caregivers or others.",

It is differentiated from schizophreniform disorder and schizophrenia by the duration of the psychosis. The diagnosis is often anticipatory or retrospective due to the diagnostic requirement of complete remission within 1 month. Brief psychotic disorder is an acute but transient disorder with the onset of one or more of the following psychotic symptoms: Delusions Hallucinations Disorganized speech Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior At least one of these symptoms must be delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech. The symptoms in BPD last between one day to one month, with a complete return to premorbid level of functioning after the disease course in response to antipsychotic medications. The disturbance in behavior cannot be better accounted for by schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, mood disorder with psychotic features, or be a direct result of a drug, medication, or medical condition like thyrotoxicosis, sarcoidosis, or syphilis.",

A differentiation is made between neuroglucopenic symptoms (e.g., confusion, somnolence) on the one hand, and those that arise as a result of the counterregulatory response of the sympathetic nervous system (e.g., tremor, sweating), on the other. The diagnosis of hypoglycemia can cause considerable problems, in particular when only isolated single symptoms present (e.g., confusion, psychosis, seizures, coma). For the elective clarification of recurrent hypoglycemia, further diagnostic examinations (e.g., fasting with determination of hormones, measurement of insulin) are employed in addition to the patient's history. For differential diagnostic considerations not only organic causes, but also adverse drug reactions and a factitious genesis must be excluded. In the event of an emergency (e.g., hypoglycemic coma) the usual form of treatment is the administration of glucoses or glucagon.",

Course a. Chronic, usually early onset, poor long-term outcome,devastating illness 1) Prodromal phase: often prolonged period of socialwithdrawal, delayed developmental milestones, awkward in motor skills, loss of interest in self-care2) Active phase: psychotic symptoms appear, diagnosis is made more clear3) Residual phase: similar to prodomal phase b. Prognostic features and indicators1) Good outcome a) Acute onset, short duration, no previous psychi-atric history, no family history of schizophrenia b) Mood symptoms present, sensorium clouded c) No obsessive-compulsive disorder, noassaultiveness d) Premorbid functioning good, high socioeconomicclass e) Married, good psychosexual functioning f) Normal findings on neuroimaging2) Poor outcome a) Insidious onset, chronic duration, psychiatric his-tory present, positive family history of schizophreniab) Mood symptoms absent, sensorium clear c) Obsessive-compulsive disorder is present,assaultiveness is present d) Poor premorbid functioning, low socioeconomicclasse) Never married, poor psychosexual functioning f) Structural abnormalities present on neuroimaging5.

Selective reduction in size of frontal lobe, basal ganglia, thalamus, and limbic regions, including the hippocampus and medial temporal lobec. Possible decrease in volume of neocortical and deep gray matterd. Sulcal widening, especially frontal and temporal areas e.

Positron emission tomographic (PET) studies implicatefrontal cortex (orbital, dorsolateral, medial), anterior cingulate gyrus, thalamus, several temporal lobe subregions, and cerebellumc. PET studies: anatomic substrate for visual hallucinations in schizophrenia 1) Inferotemporal cortex is responsible for visual recogni-tion of objects and faces 2) Basal ganglia output (primarily substantia nigra parsreticulata) to inferotemporal cortex with relay in ventral anterior thalamic nucleus-influences visualprocessing and causes altered visual perception (hallucinations) as a result of increased dopaminergic activity in basal ganglia (may also be the mechanism of hallucinations in parkinsonian syndromes sensitive to dopaminergic agents [diffuse Lewy body disease more so than idiopathic Parkinson disease])9. Neuropathology a. Decreased cell density in the dorsomedial nucleus ofthalamus b. Displacement of interneurons in frontal lobe cortex c. Developmental issues1) History of injury at birth may contribute to development of schizophrenia2) Season of birth: more schizophrenics are born in early spring or winter10. Neurochemical considerations a. Dopamine hypothesis: excess of dopamine linked topsychotic symptoms 1) Dopamine-blocking drugs seemed to lessen psychoticsymptoms (antipsychotics) 2) Drugs stimulating dopamine release caused psychoticsymptoms (amphetamine, cocaine) 3) Five types of dopamine receptors: D1, D2, D3, D4,D5 a) D1: located in cerebral cortex and basal ganglia b) D2: located in striatum c) D3 and D4: high concentration in the limbicsystem d) D5: located in thalamus, hippocampus, andhypothalamus 4) Hyperactivity of dopamine system (especially D2receptor): thought important to positive symptoms of schizophreniab. Postmortem findings in schizophrenics 1) Increased dopamine or homovanillic acid in limbicareas and left amygdala (may be consequence of treatment with antipsychotics)c. PET used to measure receptor occupancy of antipsychotic medications 1) Typicals: D2 receptors (78% receptor occupancy), noobvious D1 receptors 2) Atypicals: D2 receptors (48%), D1 receptors (38%-52%), D1 receptors are associated with fewer extrapyramidal symptoms11. Clinical management (see PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AND OTHER TREATMENTS) a. Mainstay treatments: antipsychotics (D2 receptor block-ers [postsynaptic]) b.

Maintenance therapy, for at least 1 to 2 years after the initial psychotic episoded. Alternative treatments 1) Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT): schizophrenia doesnot typically respond to ECT, but it could be considered for catatonic schizophrenia2) Many benefit from benzodiazepines, mood stabilizers, antidepressants12. Psychosocial intervention strategies a. Emphasis on outpatient treatment b. Partial hospitalization, day treatments, outpatient care c. Family therapy reduces relapse rate d. Self-help organizations e. Cognitive therapy techniques: the goal is to remediatethe abnormal thought processes f. Social skills training: little effect on risk of relapse g.

The picture differs from that of the usual uncomplicated recovery which follows the hypoglycemic state in that its criteria are: (1) normal blood sugar or induced hyperglycemia; (2) a shifting neurologic picture; (3) peripheral manifestation of fluctuant control of the autonomic nervous system, such as alterations in regulation of heat, disturbances in cardioregulatory function, sudomotor hyperactivity and hyperpnea, with consequent tetany; (4) convulsive phenomena or their equivalents; (5) prolonged coma, and (6) associated with recovery of consciousness, disturbances in the sensorium, alterations in memory function and a quantitative reduction in all higher cortical functions.

A listing of these factors would include the following: (<i>a</i>) toxins of the acute infectious diseases, and other toxins; (<i>b</i>) drugs, as salicylates, quinine, nicotine, alcohol, and streptomycin; (<i>c</i>) trauma, direct and indirect, as fractures or concussion; (<i>d</i>) occupational hazards, as noises and pressure changes; (<i>e</i>) specific diseases, as syphilis; (<i>f</i>) vascular disturbances of the brain and specialized centers or of local circulation to the cochlea and vestibule; (<i>g</i>) degenerative diseases of the nerve locally or of higher centers; (<i>h</i>) neoplastic changes. The lesions from these factors may be in the cochlea, the acoustic nerve, or the brain center. Yet the cause is, oftener than not, obscure and inferential, being arrived at by elimination or deduction long after the original symptoms appear, whereas the primary factors in the etiology usually remain untraced. This is a paradox",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCCIÓN Los 2C (popularmente conocidos como tusi o cocaína rosa) son un grupo de sustancias pertenecientes a las fenetilaminas con efecto psicoestimulante y alucinógeno. Su uso, por vía oral o esnifada, se ha visto incrementado en los últimos años, con efectos psicopatológicos variables. CASO CLÍNICO Presentamos el caso clínico de un varón de 22 años, que inicia seguimiento recientemente en su centro de salud mental, observándose rasgos narcisistas de personalidad. Es traído a Urgencias por sobreingesta medicamentosa e intento de ahorcamiento. Reconoce consumo frecuente de tusi o cocaína rosa, refiriendo además sentirse muy inquieto, nervioso y con ideas de muerte y autolesión, llegando a ingerir cantidades excesivas de lormetazepam o intentarse ahorcar en casa, de forma muy impulsiva y sin otro desencadenante aparente. El screening de drogas de abuso resulta negativo para las sustancias estudiadas. DISCUSIÓN Los efectos clínicos del 2C se encuentran entre lo estimulante y lo psicodélico, con sensación de bienestar, euforia, incremento de la sociabilidad, y a más dosis, alteraciones sensoperceptivas. Se ha descrito la aparición de síntomas psicóticos tras su consumo. La aparición de marcada ansiedad, impulsividad y conducta suicida podría estar relacionada con el consumo de esta sustancia, con consecuencias graves. CONCLUSIÓN Se necesita estudiar con mayor profundidad los efectos clínicos, psicopatológicos y especialmente sobre la conducta suicida del consumo de fenetilaminas, cuyo uso va en aumento, según los últimos datos. La correcta anamnesis en los hábitos de consumo debe ocupar un lugar primordial, y estar en alerta al no ser siempre detectada en los tests de drogas de abuso habituales.",

      "abstract": "Under certain conditions or in an overdose setting, several classes of drugs can induce illusions, hallucinations, or delusions. However, one of the hallmark features of hallucinogens or psychedelic agents is their ability to induce states of altered or distorted perception, thought, and mood. Many hallucinogens produce classic sympathomimetic effects; that is, hyperactivity, mydriasis (dilated pupils), hypertension, tachycardia, and hyperthermia. However, the effects vary considerably, depending upon the hallucinogen ingested. Qualitative confirmation by the laboratory that the patient is suffering from hallucinogen intoxication such as marijuana use can be helpful to the clinician. However, the common toxicologic drug screens used by most clinical laboratories do not detect many hallucinogenic agents (such as LSD [lysergic acid diethylamide]). Thus, diagnosis of hallucinogen ingestion and treatment is often based on history of use and physical examination.",

Some of these symptoms, that include an array of behavioral and psychiatric manifestations, are known as behavioral and psychiatric (or psychological) symptoms of dementia (BPSD). For several reasons they are an important case for General Practitioner consultation. Some of the se symptoms tend to oc cur si mul ta ne ously, in factors, such as psychosis (agitation and aggressiveness), mood (depression and anxiety), frontal behavior (desinhibition and euphoria), apathy and insomnia. The cause of these symptoms can be dementia itself, and in some situations they are a core diagnostic feature in the diagnosis. However, the possibility of a drug or a somatic disease as a cause for the se symptoms must always be actively sought, especially if the BPSD have a particular clinical presentation. So, the exclusion of another medial disorder (that is non demential) is mandatory. After excluding other causes, a treatment with an anti-dementia drug must be offered, as there is evidence that acetylcholines terase inhibitors and memantine improve, not only cognition, but also BPSD in some dementia (including Alzheimer's disease). Then, non-pharmacologial measures must be started. However, a pharmacological treatment with psychotropic drugs should also be started, if treatment is urgent or the symptoms severe. The symptom or symptoms should be identified and the therapeutic targeted for those specific symptoms. Despite the clinical trials performed with psychotropics for BPSD are uncommon and sometimes have questionable designs, it is very important to treat these symptoms. Care givers should also be instructed on how to deal with BPSD. Whenever a BPSD is difficult to control, especially if not improving after a trial with the measures here described, a referral for Neurologic or Psychiatric evaluation should be done. There ferral note should be \"BPSD [specify] severe and not improving after treatment with [specify]\".",

Examples of such drugs are LSD, mescaline, and tryptamine derivatives such as dimethyltryptamine (DMT). The imagery-producing psychodysleptics such as cannabis and various coumarins (e.g., from Calea zacatechichi) potentiate visual imagery and produce characteristic distortions in time perception, body-image, and thought. Trance-producing psychodysleptics (such as lysergic acid amide (obtained from Rivea corymbosa) ololiquhqui, turbicoryn, and corymbosine), as their names suggest, produce trance-like states.

      "abstract": "DRUGS, BIOCHEMISTRY, AND CONSCIOUS EXPERIENCE: TOWARD A THEORY OF PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY PAUL WILLNER* Levels ofExplanation ofPsychotropic Drug Effects A few micrograms of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) can produce a major psychological experience, usually described as an \"altered state of consciousness,\" which can sometimes be the most powerful experience a person has ever had. \"Explanations\" ofthese phenomena usually involve a discussion of the neurotransmitter 5-hydroxy-tryptamine (5-HT) [1, 2]. Clearly, however, a description of biochemical phenomena in no sense explains the LSD experience, since no account is offered of how the biochemical changes give rise to altered states of consciousness. A similar problem arises in relation to biochemical \"theories\" of mental disorder, such as the dopamine (DA) hypothesis of schizophrenia or the catecholamine hypothesis of depression. Paranoid delusions are not explained by demonstrating that DA systems are hyperactive; neither are ideas of suicide explained by a malfunction of noradrenergic (NA) systems . However successful these reductionist hypotheses may be in generating testable hypotheses, leading, for example, to the development of effective pharmacological agents, a hypothesis of brain function which omits any reference to the structure or operating principles ofthe brain is unlikely to be of more than heuristic value. An alternative approach attempts to bridge this conceptual gap by seeking explanations of psychotropic drug effects in four independent explanatory domains: biochemical, physiological, cognitive, and subjective (using die word \"cognitive\" in the information-processing sense in which it is now used in cognitive psychology, rather than as a synonym for \"conscious\"). In terms of a computer analogy, these four domains ?Psychology Department, City of London Polytechnic, Old Castle Street, London El 7NT, England.© 1984 by The University of Chicago. AU rights reserved. 003 1-5982/85/2801-0404$01 .00 Perspectives in Biology and Medicine, 28, 1 · Autumn 1984 \\ 49 include two levels of \"hardware\" and two of \"software,\" corresponding very roughly to components, wiring, programming, and editing. Each explanatory domain has its own language and logic, and each must be understood in its own terms. A recent theory of the action of anti-anxiety drugs [3] will serve as an illustration. In this account, which is embedded within the context of a comprehensive neuropsychological theory of anxiety, anxiolytic drugs act at the GABA-benzodiazepine receptor complex, or at other sites (level 1), to disrupt the flow of impulses in neural circuits in the hippocampus and subiculum (level 2). The information carried in these circuits is used to make a comparison between actual and expected events: a mismatch activates a \"behavioural inhibition system,\" which suppresses ongoing motor activity and increases arousal and attention to the environment (level 3); these effects are experienced as anxiety (level 4). Irrespective of its empirical merits [4], the hypothesis has a sound conceptual basis. The analysis spans all four levels ofexplanation, rather than the usual two: physiological (level 2) and cognitive (level 3) levels are interposed between biochemistry (level 1) and subjective experience (level 4). In addition to describing an empirical relationship between receptor interactions and an anti-anxiety effect, die account also specifies the neural pathways implicated, their role in normal cognitive functioning , and the relationship between changes in cognitive function and changes in experience. In describing the psychological effect of a drug or an endogenous biochemical change, it is important to consider not only the intervening levels of explanation but also the nature of the transitions between adjacent levels. The generation of changes in neural firing (level 2) from the biochemical effect of a drug (level 1) depends on the integration of that biochemical effect into a context of other ongoing biochemical processes , which include adaptive regulation resulting from the primary drug effect. The effect of tricyclic antidepressant drugs at noradrenergic synapses is a well-worked example: it is now established that, in addition to potentiating neurotransmission by blocking neurotransmitter reuptake, after chronic treatment, tricyclics also decrease neurotransmission by reducing the sensitivity of postsynaptic beta-receptors [5]. It is rather less frequendy recognized, however, that the important issue is the net outcome of these and other effects on the traffic of nerve impulses in postsynaptic structures [6, 7]. Similar considerations apply to die transition from physiology (level 2) to cognitive processes (level 3). A good...",

It is a heterogeneous disorder, in that the extent and severity of the symptoms, cognitive deficits, and social dysfunction vary among individuals. The diagnosis of schizophrenia is based on meeting criteria for the presence of symptoms, decline in functioning, and level of disability and on ruling out other possible causes of the symptoms (e.g., certain neurological disorders, substance abuse). There is no laboratory or medical test that can be used to diagnosis this disorder. One theory is that schizophrenia is not a single disease but an array of disorders that share a final common pathway leading to the brain abnormalities and clinical features associated with this diagnosis.",

      "title": "Neuroanatomical and Etiological Approaches to Secondary Narcolepsy",
      "abstract": "Narcolepsy is one among the disorders of central hypersomnolence characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness not related to disturbances in nocturnal sleep or misalignment in circadian rhythms. The cardinal symptom of this group of disorders is disabling daytime sleepiness, characterized by the repeated episodes of irresistible daytime sleepiness or lapses into sleep in monotonous situations, but also under unusual conditions such as eating. Narcolepsy is defined as type 1 and type 2 on the basis of the presence of cataplexy. The most pathognomonic feature of narcolepsy type 1 is cataplexy, which is characterized by sudden episodes of brief loss of muscle tone-sparing consciousness, usually triggered by strong emotions. Other nonspecific symptoms associated with rapid eye movement sleep dissociation include fragmentation of nocturnal sleep, hypnagogic or hypnopompic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis. The pathophysiology of narcolepsy type 1 is well established as the deficiency of hypocretin (orexin) signaling in the lateral hypothalamus. In narcolepsy type 2, on the other hand, hypocretin levels are not decreased, and it has been suggested that there is probably a partial deficiency in hypocretin signaling system to cause excessive daytime sleepiness but not severe enough to cause cataplexy. Instead of types 1 and 2, primary (idiopathic) narcolepsy, familial narcolepsy, secondary (symptomatic) narcolepsy, and narcolepsy plus (hereditary forms with additional neurological symptoms) forms were suggested to better classify the clinical entities. In this paper, the diagnosis of symptomatic or secondary narcolepsy is reviewed and classified based on the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms.",

In spite of the implicitly wrong conception of reality, the significance of these delusions as an attempt to express, interpret and cope with mental illness should not be neglected if an approach to the patient's own experience is sought. On the one hand, hypochondriacal delusions are based on altered body perceptions in mental illness, characterized by primary local or general dysaesthesias to the point of depersonalisation, or caused secondarily by the patient's increased attention to his own body. This alienated bodily experience is named in (lay) medical terms by the delusional hypochondriac. On the other hand, \"illness\" with its manifold cultural and psychological meanings stands as a polyvalent metaphor for the incomprehensible alteration of the patient's self-experience in general: thus, the feeling of exposure to external attacks, of guilt, sinfulness, shame, loss of self-esteem or even the experience of a disruption of personality may find their expression in the hypochondriacal delusion.",

      "title": "A Case of Interdose Discontinuation Symptoms With Venlafaxine Extended Release",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: Venlafaxine extended release (XR) is a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor that, like many other antidepressants, may be associated with a discontinuation syndrome. Discontinuation syndromes are, in part, related to drugs with short half-lives1 (eg, for venlafaxine and its metabolite, 5 and 11 hours, respectively). Venlafaxine XR discontinuation symptoms have been clinically reported as soon as 6 hours2 and as long as 9 days3 after discontinuation of the drug, but typically emerge in 1–4 days.4 In one study, the prevalence of typical discontinuation symptoms with venlafaxine XR (eg, dysphoria, headaches, nausea, irritability, emotional lability, sleep disturbance) was 27%.5 However, discontinuation symptoms may be severe6,7 in up to 5% of cases.8 In addition, unexpected symptoms may emerge such as “shock-like sensations,”9 gait difficulties,10 palinopsia (persistent visual images),11 delirium,12 suicidal ideation,13 and hypomania14 or mania.14,15 In the following case, we describe a patient who experienced routine venlafaxine XR discontinuation symptoms within hours of daily dosing.\r\n\r\nCase report. In December 2009, Ms A, a 41-year-old white woman with a history of hypertension and palpitations, was prescribed venlafaxine XR 37.5 mg/d by another primary care provider for the treatment of depression. With a change in primary care providers in January 2011, Ms A promptly discussed her concerns with venlafaxine XR. According to the patient, approximately 2 months after the onset of the venlafaxine XR trial, she began to experience a number of side effects in the absence of any other changes in medication, including nausea, irritability, emotional lability, and, most troublesome, “electrical brain shocks.” Oddly, all of these symptoms occurred on a daily basis, and they consistently emerged approximately 8–10 hours after the administration of the daily dose of venlafaxine XR. Symptoms would then promptly resolve after Ms A took the next dose of venlafaxine XR.\r\n\r\nBecause the patient seemed to be experiencing discontinuation symptoms, she was switched to regular-release venlafaxine 37.5 mg in January 2011, which was dosed twice per day. The regular-release venlafaxine was well tolerated. Within 2 weeks, the patient confirmed that most, if not all, of her symptoms had subsided.\r\n\r\nAlthough discontinuation symptoms from venlafaxine XR have been clinically described by one author in as few as 6 hours after the last dose,2 we are unaware of any actual case reports of venlafaxine XR interdose discontinuation symptoms. This phenomenon may be related to individual genetics and the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme system. Specifically, venlafaxine XR is metabolized by the 2D6 isoenzyme, which is subject to broad genetic polymorphism. In this regard, Zhou16 has described 4 genetic variants: ultrarapid metabolizers, extensive metabolizers, intermediate metabolizers, and poor metabolizers, which constitute 3%–5%, 70%–80%, 10%–17%, and 5%–10% of white individuals, respectively. It is possible that our patient was an ultrarapid metabolizer and briskly eliminated venlafaxine XR through the 2D6 isoenzyme, resulting in interdose discontinuation symptoms.\r\n\r\nAs for clinical approaches to interdose discontinuation symptoms, venlafaxine XR or regular-release venlafaxine may be dosed twice per day, or a patient might be switched to an antidepressant that is less dependent on 2D6 metabolism, such as sertraline, citalopram, or mirtazapine.17 To conclude, to our knowledge, this is the first case report of interdose discontinuation symptoms with venlafaxine XR.",

In addition, persons with insomnia are at higher risk of developing a new psychiatric disorder, particularly major depression, within a year of the onset of insomnia. Psychiatric disorders can give rise to insomnia, excessive sleepiness, or parasomnias (eg, nightmares or sleep terrors) (Boxes 11–1 and 11–2).. It has been estimated that a third to a half of cases of chronic insomnia are associated with a psychiatric condition. Changes in sleep architecture include a decrease in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep latency that is seen with depressive episodes, schizophrenia, and borderline personality disorder. Schizophrenia (psychosis) is a chronic psychiatric disorder characterized by both “positive symptoms” (eg, hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized speech and behavior) and “negative symptoms” (eg, affective flattening, avolition [limited goal-directed behavior], and alogia [restricted thought and speech production]). This disabling condition has a median age of onset between 15 and 25 years of age. Course is chronic with significant impairments in self-care, interpersonal interactions, and work performance.",

It can be primary or secondary, signs and symptoms of which include exorbitant daytime sleepiness, irregular breathing or increased movement during sleep and difficulty falling asleep. A few outcomes of sleep loss are obesity in adults and children, diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance, cardiovascular disease and hypertension, anxiety symptoms, depressed mood and alcohol use. Sleep disorders are frequently associated with psychiatric issues particularly depression. Studies have demonstrated that individuals with a sleeping disorder have a ten times risk of having depression in contrast to individuals who rest soundly. OSA is also linked with depression. SSRIs which increase 5-HT function increase REM sleep latency, and reduce REM sleep. Some individuals show significant improvements in depressive symptoms following a night of incomplete or complete lack of sleep, leading physicians to consider using sleep deprivation as an intervention. Antidepressants and other treatments for depression can have a beneficial effect on sleep. There is a need to evaluate for primary somnipathies, any medications being taken and underlying medical, psychiatric or substance use disorder.",

      "abstract": "パーキンソン病の代表的症として“四大症状”といわれるものがある. それは,“安静時振戦 (手足が震える) ”,“筋固縮 (筋肉が硬くなる) ”,“無動症状 (体の動きが鈍くなる) ”,“姿勢反射障害 (立位時のバランス障害) ”などの運動機能の症状が挙げられる. しかし, 近年パーキンソン病でも運動機能の症状以外の様々な症状が出現することが認識されるようになった. これらの症状は“非運動症状”と呼ばれている. 具体的には精神神経症状 (幻覚や認知症など), 睡眠障害, 自律神経障害, 消化器症状, 感覚障害 (痛み, しびれなど) などが挙げられる. この中でも特に認知症についてはパーキンソン病の病態にとって重要な症状と考えられている. 認知症というと真っ先に思い浮かぶのは加齢による老年性認知症やアルツハイマー病であるが, パーキンソン病における認知症は老年性認知症やアルツハイマー病の認知症とは異なる特徴を有している. 一つは物忘れなどの記銘力障害だけでなく遂行機能と呼ばれるものが障害される. これは様々な情報をうまく処理して対応する機能でこれがうまくできないと発想の柔軟性や多様性がなくなり多くのことに対する対応ができなくなることである. 次に幻覚やうつ症状といった精神的な症状が関与しやすいことである. 幻覚やうつなどの精神症状はパーキンソン病の非運動症状でも頻度の多いものでありこれらの症状が合併すると本来の認知機能がさらに修飾されより複雑な症状となり対応に苦慮せざるを得ないことが多い. さらに, パーキンソン病に関連するl-dopaは運動だけでなく認知機能, 精神症状にも影響を及ぼすため治療として投与している抗パーキンソン病薬がこれらの症状に影響し十分な運動の治療ができなくなることも多くみられる. 認知症というと高齢者のイメージがあるが, パーキンソン病の認知機能障害はもちろん高齢者のほうが出現頻度は高いが, 比較的早期に高齢でない年齢でも発症することがある. このような場合精神症状が早期から出やすいという特徴もある. パーキンソン病の認知機能障害についてはアルツハイマー病に対するドネペジルや漢方の抑肝散などが治療約として使われることがあるが, 認知機能障害そのもののに対する効果は難しく運動症状の治療薬である抗パーキンソン病薬とのバランスを上手くとりながら薬剤治療だけでなくリハビリや介護の面でもサポートをしていく必要がある. この点は担当Drや看護師, 理学療法士らとコミュニケーションを取りながら家族だけで悩まずに問題に取り組んでいかなければならない.",

Patient and informant history taking, along with simple additional cognitive tests are usually sufficient to reassure patients or to initiate further diagnostic work-up. Differential diagnoses include depression, delirium, other psychiatric or neurological disorders, metabolic causes, intoxications or side effects of drugs. Physical examination and laboratory tests generally have limited added value. Main reasons for referral are a suspected treatable cause for cognitive decline (e.g. delirium), focal neurological deficit (e.g. stroke), suspected dementia under the age of 65-70 years, additional complex somatic or psychiatric disorders or further work-up in non-native speaking people.",

      "abstract": "Delirium is a functional brain disorder characterized by disturbances of consciousness, attention, and cognition. The term ‘acute confusional state’ is often used synonymously with ‘delirium’. Delirium may be associated with a range of associated clinical features including increased or decreased psychomotor activity (hyperactive and hypoactive variants), hallucinations and delusions, and efferent sympathetic hyperactivity. Delirium with pronounced psychomotor and sympathetic hyperactivity is more often seen in younger patients with alcohol or substance intoxication/withdrawal (delirium tremens), but no cause is specific to a clinical subtype. Delirium is distinguished from dementia (with which it may coexist, as dementia is a major risk factor for delirium) by its speed of onset (over hours or days) and reversibility with correction of the underlying cause. In some patients, however, delirium may be followed by long-term cognitive impairment, suggesting that the pathophysiology of delirium overlaps with that of dementia.",

This apparent lack of response is either due to \"pseudo-resistance\" (a failure to have received and adhered to a recognized and effective treatment or treatments for their condition) or to true \"treatment resistance.\" Pseudo-resistance can be due to clinician errors in selecting and delivering an appropriate treatment effectively, or to patient nonadherence to a course of treatment. True treatment resistance can be due to unrecognized exogenous anxiogenic factors (eg, caffeine overuse, sleep deprivation, use of alcohol or marijuana) or an incorrect diagnosis (eg, atypical bipolar illness, occult substance abuse, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder). Once the above factors are eliminated, treatment should focus on combining effective medications and cognitive behavioral therapy, combining several medications (augmentation), or employing novel medications or psychotherapies not typically indicated as first-line evidence-based anxiety treatments.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is the difficulty to initiate or to maintain sleep. It also has to do with waking up too early at least for a month. A patient with insomnia has daytime consequences such as fatigue, sleepiness, changes in mood, lose of concentration, as well as changes in his social performance and his family relationships, among others. The relationship between this disorder and physical and mental health is important due to the impact that it has on the quality of life and life expectancy of those who suffer from it. Unfortunately, insomnia usually goes unnoticed or untreated, which contributes to the onset or worsening of psychiatric and medical conditions. This exacerbates the problem of insomnia in the elderly people. In relation to the treatment it is recommended: 1) the search and management of secondary causes of insomnia, 2) a non-drug therapy that includes sleep hygiene measures, 3) pharmacotherapy. It is not recommended to start a treatment with a hypnotic drug without rule out medications or diseases that cause or exacerbate insomnia. It is not recommended the use of narcoleptics, melatonin, antihistamines or long half-life benzodiazepines. The consequences include limitations on activities of daily living, loss of functionality, impaired quality of life, increased morbidity and mortality, as well as the worsening of preexisting chronic conditions.El insomnio es la dificultad para conciliar o mantener el sueño; también consiste en despertar demasiado temprano al menos durante un mes. Un paciente con insomnio presenta consecuencias diurnas como fatiga, somnolencia, deterioro de la memoria, cambios en el estado de ánimo, en la concentración, así como en su desempeño social o familiar, entre otros. La asociación de este padecimiento con la salud física y mental es importante debido al impacto que tiene en la calidad y la esperanza de vida de los que lo padecen. Desafortunadamente, el insomnio suele pasar desapercibido o no tratarse, lo cual contribuye al empeoramiento de condiciones médicas y psiquiátricas. Esto se acentúa más en los adultos mayores, grupo por demás vulnerable. En relación con el tratamiento se recomienda aplicar la siguiente combinación: 1) la búsqueda y el manejo de causas secundarias de insomnio, 2) alguna terapia no farmacológica que incluya medidas de higiene del sueño, 3) tratamiento farmacológico. No es recomendable comenzar el tratamiento con un hipnótico sin haber descartado fármacos o enfermedades que provoquen o exacerben este padecimiento. Tampoco se recomienda el uso de neurolépticos, melatonina, antihistamínicos o benzodiacepinas de vida media larga. Las consecuencias incluyen limitación en las actividades de la vida diaria, pérdida de la funcionalidad, deterioro en la calidad de vida, incremento en la morbimortalidad, además del empeoramiento de las condiciones crónicas prexistentes.",

The syndrome may occur in cases of apparent health or show itself as an exacerbation during any form of schizophrenia.

The symptoms are: A prodromal phase which lasts from 2 weeks to a few months and shows the usual schizophrenic pattern. First Phase.—Increasing perplexity and intense anxiety; incoherence; extreme restlessness; a \"blind drive for annihilation\" and suicidal tendencies; acrocyanosis, increased blood-pressure. Second Phase.—Motor restlessness changing to a more primitive pattern; consciousness becomes increasingly clouded; unusual hematopoietic changes of the blood; blood pressure falls; pulse is rapid and weak; pupils are dilated and react sluggishly to light; reflexes are decreased; high elevation of temperature; pronounced cyanosis; petechial hemorrhages into the tissue; sudden respiratory death or vasomotor collapse. Autopsy Findings.—Negative except for petechial hemorrhages into the tissues, and transformation of the fatty bone marrow to the erythropoietic state.

      "title": "Incidence Of Post-Operative Delirium In Geriatric Patients Undergoing Hip Replacement Surgery Using Pre-Operative Haloperidol",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Delirium is acute onset &amp; fluctuating disturbance in mental state that causes patient appear confused, disoriented or with difficulty to focus and with decline in cognitive function (memory, orientation, speech), circadian disturbance and behavior of patient either agitated or sleepy,in other words sudden confusion. Delirium, also known as acute confusional state, is an organically-caused decline from a previously baseline level of mental function that develops over a short period of time (hours to days). Delirium is not a disease itself, but a syndrome encompassing disturbances in attention, consciousness, and cognition. It may also involve other neurological deficits, like psychomotor disturbances (e.g. hyperactive, hypoactive, or mixed), impaired sleepwake cycle, emotional disturbances, and perceptual disturbances (e.g. hallucinations and delusions). Objective To determine incidence of post-operative delirium in geriatric patients undergoing hip replacement surgery using pre-operative haloperidol. Patients and Methods This study is conducted through geriatric patients undergoing orthopedic surgery and the incidence of pre.&amp; post-operative delirium. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted post-operative surgical ICU in Demerdash hospital which was closed unit and had the same well-established pain, sedation and delirium assessment practices. A delirium was monitored through CAM score in their stay in ICU (max. for &amp;7 days from admission post-operative). Results Several trials stated that the usage of Haloperidol pre-operative decrease the duration and the severity of Delirium rather than the incidence of delirium. In our trial we will detect the incidence of delirium with using prophylactic haloperidol in geriatric patients undergoing Hip replacement surgery. In our study revealed that using prophylactic pre-operative haloperidol decrease the incidence of delirium among geriatric patient as well as decreasing both the duration and the severity of delirium among the study group. Conclusion Our study and results revealed that Haloperidol as antipsychotic drug have beneficial effect on reduction of incidence of delirium in post-operative geriatric patients, also it showed effect on duration of delirium and severity of the disease as well as ICU stay.",

But clinical syndromes and personality disorders are now seen as separate entities; therefore, psychogenic trance is part of the so-called 'dissociative disorders'. Here, the integrative functions of the psyche are reduced and control of memory, identity, sensoric and motoric functions are impaired. As a consequence, certain disorders are observed, which have common characteristics, such as onset (psychogenic trauma), course (initial panic or belle indifference) and psychodynamics (repression of an unbearable reality). The following disorders can be distinguished: --psychogenic amnesia: partial or complete loss of memory --psychogenic trance: temporary loss of habitual identity with more or less full awareness of surroundings --psychogenic fugue: apparently purposeful journey away from home with psychogenic amnesia --psychogenic stupor: profound diminuation or absence of voluntary movement and no responsiveness to external stimuli.",

Patients suffering from delirium experience an acute change in mental status, fluctuating levels of consciousness, and an inability to acquire new information. Patients with major neurocognitive disorder experience significant cognitive decline in complex attention, executive function, learning and memory, language, perceptual-motor, and social cognition. The chapter also discusses mental disorders due to another medical condition. These patients can experience psychotic, mood, or anxious symptoms or a personality change; their intellectual functioning usually remains intact. A patient presenting with a first episode of psychiatric symptoms and no prior psychiatric history should be evaluated for an acute medical etiology causing the psychiatric symptoms, particularly if he or she is over 40 years of age. Anticholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine) may slow the rate of cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease, and the combination of an anticholinesterase inhibitor and memantine may be more effective than either medication alone.",

These analogous states include mental abstraction, lucid dreaming, induced trance (or deep relaxation), voluntary or induced somnambulism (commonly called sleepwalking), and certain varieties of catalepsy and epilepsy. When deployed within Gothic fiction, these states are usually enhanced further through a customary (though scientifically dubious) association with occult phenomena such as prescience and clairvoyance, and with suggestions of personal and sexual violations of the entranced self, the origins of which can be traced to the earliest days of systematic hypnotism in Europe.",

Hallucinogen use is highest among young adults; 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is the most commonly used agent, followed by lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and phencyclidine (PCP). Hallucinogens alter sensory perception and change the qualities of thought or emotion. PCP, MDMA, and LSD can be detected in urine drug tests. There appear to be few serious lasting complications associated with hallucinogen use. There are few data on the treatment of individuals who use hallucinogens or dissociatives.",

      "title": "The neuropharmacology of sleep paralysis hallucinations: serotonin 2A activation and a novel therapeutic drug",
      "abstract": "Sleep paralysis is a state of involuntary immobility occurring at sleep onset or offset, often accompanied by uncanny \"ghost-like\" hallucinations and extreme fear reactions. I provide here a neuropharmacological account for these hallucinatory experiences by evoking the role of the serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2AR). Research has shown that 5-HT2AR activation can induce visual hallucinations, \"mystical\" subjective states, and out-of-body experiences (OBEs), and modulate fear circuits. Hallucinatory experiences triggered by serotonin-serotonergic (\"pseudo\") hallucinations, induced by hallucinogenic drugs-tend to be \"dream-like\" with the experiencer having insight (\"meta-awareness\") that he is hallucinating, unlike dopaminergic (\"psychotic\" and \"life-like\") hallucinations where such insight is lost. Indeed, hallucinatory experiences during sleep paralysis have the classic features of serotonergic hallucinations, and are strikingly similar to perceptual and subjective states induced by hallucinogenic drugs (e.g., lysergic acid diethylamide [LSD] and psilocybin), i.e., they entail visual hallucinations, mystical experiences, OBEs, and extreme fear reactions. I propose a possible mechanism whereby serotonin could be functionally implicated in generating sleep paralysis hallucinations and fear reactions through 5-HT2AR activity. Moreover, I speculate on the role of 5-HT2C receptors vis-à-vis anxiety and panic during sleep paralysis, and the orbitofrontal cortex-rich with 5-HT2A receptors-in influencing visual pathways during sleep paralysis, and, in effect, hallucinations. Finally, I propose, for the first time, a drug to target sleep paralysis hallucinations and fear reactions, namely the selective 5-HT2AR inverse agonist, pimavanserin. This account implicates gene HTR2A on chromosome 13q as the underlying cause of sleep paralysis hallucinations and could be explored using positron emission tomography.",

      "title": "On the hypersensitivity syndrome induced by the selective serotonin reuptake inhibiting antidepressant Zimeldine : A clinical and experimental study",
      "abstract": "Zimeldine, the first selective neuronal serotonin (5-H1) reuptake inhibitor to be registered as an antidepressant was withdrawn from common use due to an acute flu-like adverse syndrome comprising fever, myalgia and/or arthralgia and signs of disturbed liver function. A few of these patients also developed a peripheral neuropathy, in the most serious form a Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS). The reaction was tentatively termed a hypersensitivity syndrome (HSS).Patients who had developed a HSS during zimeldine therapy (HSS-patients) were compared to control patients who tolerated the drug.No predictor to the HSS emerged concerning demographic data, psychiatric illness, previous medical history, medications with zimeldine or other drugs, other diseases, professional or nutritional circumstances. Nor was there any sign that HSS-patients who also developed neurological symptoms had a different profile of the HSS than other HSS-patients. Earlier zin1eldine treatment per se was not seen to predispose for development of a HSS or any other kind of adverse experience during subsequent therapy. The spectrum of adverse reactions was in agreement with those reported in previous studies and no new case of the GBS was revealed. The estimated frequency of HSS ranged from 0.63 to 3.4 % in spontaneous reports to the regnlatory authority and 1.4- 13% in a written inquiry. Among closely monitored inpatients 31 %developed a HSS. The mechanism for the HSS does not seem to be related primarily to the 5-HT reuptake inhibition as such. No HLA-associated disposition for the HSS was found. Nor was there any support for a HLA-associated disposition for depressive disorders. The pathogenetic mechanism for the HSS seems to involve an inlmunological response to antigens related to zimeldine.Zimeldine and its main primary metabolite norzimeldine both suppressed clinical signs of experimental allergic neuritis (EAN) in Lewis rats. Imrnunomodulatory effects in vitro of zimeldine, its metabolites norzimeldine and CPP 200 as well as of other monoamine reuptake inhibiting antidepressants were identified in the same EAN model.These observations call for further research on immunological mechanisms in the pathogenesis of mental disorders as well as on the potential role of drugs acting on the monoamine systems in the treatment of autoimmune diseases. The findings also justify a discussion on the application of immunological methods in the testing of new psychopharmacological drugs.Based on the presented results the tentatively used term for the adverse reactions to zimeldine, the hypersensitivity syndrome, seems justified.",

In caffeine intoxication, these symptoms cause significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other important areas of functioning and are not due to a general medical condition or better accounted for by another mental disorder (e.g. an anxiety disorder). Nicotine is highly lipid‐soluble and rapidly enters the brain after inhalation. Nicotine receptors are found on dopaminergic cell bodies and stimulation of these receptors leads to dopamine release. Withdrawal symptoms occur within 6–12 hours of stopping smoking and include intense craving, depressed mood, insomnia, anxiety, restlessness, irritability, difficulty in concentrating and increased appetite. Nicotine withdrawal can be misdiagnosed as depression, anxiety, sleep disorders and mania. Withdrawal can also exacerbate the symptoms of schizophrenia.",

Such massive defense has been created as a bulwark against various dangers, such as (1) psychotic anxieties (fear of mental or physical fragmentation; loss of identity-feeling; danger of uncontrollable, explosive action); (2) profound perturbation concerning the narcissistic self-image and its fluctuations, and (3) pathological formation of the ego-ideal structure concerning affective experience.

This is a state of altered consciousness characterised chiefly by inattention or lack of arousal, but can also include new impairment of language, perception and behaviour. Certain predisposing factors can make an individual more susceptible to delirium in the face of a stressor. Stressors include direct insults to the brain, insults peripheral to the brain or external changes in the environment of an individual. Delirium is varied in its presentation, and can be categorised by the psychomotor profile as: hyperactive type (overly vigilant, agitated, often wandersome), hypoactive type (sedate or withdrawn) or mixed types.",

      "abstract": "<h3>ABSTRACT</h3> Delirium describes a sudden onset change in mental status of fluctuating course. This is a state of altered consciousness characterised chiefly by inattention or lack of arousal, but can also include new impairment of language, perception and behaviour. Certain predisposing factors can make an individual more susceptible to delirium in the face of a stressor. Stressors include direct insults to the brain, insults peripheral to the brain or external changes in the environment of an individual. Delirium is varied in its presentation, and can be categorised by the psychomotor profile as: hyperactive type (overly vigilant, agitated, often wandersome), hypoactive type (sedate or withdrawn) or mixed types.",

      "title": "Effectiveness of progressive muscle relaxation training for adults diagnosed with schizophrenia: a systematic review protocol",
      "abstract": "Review question/objective The objective of this review is to systematically search, appraise and synthesize the best available evidence on the effectiveness of Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) in the human responses of adults with schizophrenia and no positive symptoms of disease, in any setting, regarding anxiety, social isolation, personal and social functioning, cognition, sadness, conversation, and well-being. More specifically, the review will focus on the following question: What is the effectiveness of Progressive Muscle Relaxation training on anxiety, social isolation, personal and social functioning, cognition, conversation, and well-being in adults with schizophrenia? Background Schizophrenia is often characterized by a long prodromal phase and a gradual change in psychosocial functioning, with symptoms that could include changes in affect (such as anxiety, irritability and depression), cognition (such as difficulty in concentration or memory), thought content (such as preoccupation with new ideas), physical changes (such as sleep disturbance and loss of energy), social withdrawal and impairment of role functioning.1,2 Anxiety is a prominent symptom, early in the course of schizophrenia, and is viewed both as a co-morbidity and a clinical expression of schizophrenia.3 Anxiety can be a stress factor that worsens existing prodromes or symptoms, leading to a vicious circle of growing stress and increased symptoms.4 Overall, the consequences alone or in combination of these components of anxiety generate a reduced efficiency of behaviour. The anxious individual, in addition to avoiding or escaping from situations, also shows inhibition in many other activities such as establishing contact and performing professional activities outside his/her routine.5,6 The physiological and cognitive aspects can create a vicious circle with negative thoughts leading to sympathetic changes, which are themselves interpreted in a negative way. The result can be a spiraling of anxiety.6 “Stress is an everyday fact of life, and we can't avoid it”.8(p.1) “Nervous tension is a more frequent ailment than the common cold. It is a greater danger because tension can reduce your efficiency, destroy your health and shorten your life”.7(p.1) We consider that day-to-day living confronts the person with a continuous stream of potentially stressful situations. If stress is acknowledged as reasonable, it becomes propulsive, constituting an impulse that causes the individual to make decisions, solve problems, and improve his/her functioning and abilities. In this sense, stress will help motivate the individual to achieve desirable goals, giving some flavor to life and providing an incentive for personal and professional achievement.8,9 We can experience stress from four basic sources: the Environment (the environment besieges you with demands to adjust); Social Stressors (the demands of the different social roles we play); Physiological Sources (transitions affecting our body); and Thoughts (our brain interprets and perceives complex changes in our environment and body, and determines whether they are a problem for us and when to turn to “emergency responses”).8 The anxiety experienced in day-to-day life situations is, therefore, interpreted as a complex set of emotions, and a personality trait or a state of the individual which combines three components: cognitive, vegetative, and motor. The cognitive component relates to all thoughts and feelings developed by someone who is anxious, and relates to what the person states that he/she feels. The vegetative component translates the physiological arousal of the individual when he/she is anxious. This activation is specific to each person so it may present great variability of responses such as increased heart rate and blood pressure, changes in gastric motility, urinary emergency, sweating, and increased muscle tension. The motor component refers to the previously addressed avoidance and escape responses determined by anxiety, limiting the individual's purview expressed through tense postures and different types of unrelaxed activities.5 One way of breaking the anxiety circle would be to reinterpret bodily changes in a positive thoughts form (cognitive approach). Another way would be to use relaxation techniques such as progressive muscle relaxation (physiological theory). A third way would be to introduce graded exposure to the feared situation (behavioural approach).6 Relaxation is conceptualized as a complex response class involving motor, visceral, observational responses and verbal behaviour. Motor behaviour involves action of the skeletal muscles. Visceral responding is concerned with homeostatic functions including breathing, temperature, and muscle tension. Observational responses seek out stimuli in the environment (e.g. a quiet park setting) or generate discriminative stimuli (e.g. “seeing” a quiet park setting). Verbal behaviour is concerned with overt or covert vocal behaviour (e.g. “I am tense”) in relation to relaxed behaviour.10 Many relaxation techniques aim to increase awareness of areas of chronic unconscious muscle tension. They often involve a conscious attempt to release and relax during exhalation. Frequently, habituation occurs with repeated exposure, but some people continue to react as if they were seeing this particular stressor for the first time. Mental escape techniques, such as imagery or relaxation therapy, can help decrease arousal, but learning is essential to adaptation. Most relaxation techniques are enjoyable, and many healthy individuals practice them without having particular health problems.11,12 There are two general purposes of tension control: prophylactic and therapeutic. By learning to relax differentially 24 hours a day, a person can increase the likelihood of preventing a stress or tension disorder. For a person already thus victimized, clinical PMR can often ease or eliminate the condition.11 Most relaxation techniques need to be practiced daily. Typically, patients learn a relaxation technique over the course of eight weekly classes, each lasting an hour or so. Between classes, they practice by themselves for 15 to 30 minutes a day. After the course is over, patients are encouraged to continue on their own, though they may take further classes to learn advanced techniques or to maintain group support.12 PMR was originally developed by Edmund Jacobson, and his original method required dozens of sessions where the participant was taught to relax 30 different muscle groups. Training consisted of successive tensing and relaxing of muscle groups, beginning with the upper body and proceeding to the lower parts.13 Based on different sources, we can state that recently there has been a growing interest in relaxation techniques in the multidisciplinary treatment of patient's response to schizophrenia symptomatology. The only existing revision, within this topic, “Progressive muscle relaxation in persons with schizophrenia: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials”, aims to assess the effectiveness of progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) on psychological distress and anxiety symptoms and on response/remission for people with schizophrenia. The three selected randomized controlled trials (RCT) involved 146 patients, and authors concluded that PMR can acutely reduce state anxiety and psychological distress, and improve subjective well-being. No studies investigated the evidence for PMR as an add-on treatment for psychopathology, or for positive or negative symptoms, or for relapse prevention. This review demonstrates that PMR might be a useful add-on treatment to reduce state anxiety and psychological distress, and improve subjective well-being in persons with schizophrenia. It further demonstrates that PMR may be offered in both acute and chronic inpatient treatment settings.6 The recent research “Acute effects of progressive muscle relaxation on state anxiety and subjective well-being in chronic Bulgarian patients with schizophrenia” aimed to provide evidence on the effectiveness of PMR as means of alleviating the state anxiety and psychological distress and a way to increase subjective well-being in chronic patients with schizophrenia. Sixty-four schizophrenia patients underwent two PMR sessions which were offered once a week and lasted approximately 25 minutes13 Results revealed significant decreased state anxiety and psychological stress, and increased subjective well-being within the experimental group, and it is noteworthy that both groups differed significantly in all post-measures. Therefore, this study provides scientific evidence for the use of PMR in patients with schizophrenia in chronic psychiatric settings, offering an easy method to learn healthy alternatives to cope with subjective stress and state anxiety. A recent RCT on effects of progressive muscle relaxation on state anxiety aimed to examine the efficacy of a single progressive muscle relaxation session compared with a control condition on state anxiety, psychological stress, fatigue and subjective well-being in patients with acute inpatient schizophrenia. Sixty-four patients were randomly assigned to either a single progressive muscle relaxation session of 25 minutes or a resting control condition with the opportunity to read for an equal amount of time.14 The results show that the 27 PMR group participants showed decreased state anxiety, psychological stress and fatigue and increased subjective well-being. Between-group differences in post scores were found for state anxiety, subjective well-being and psychological stress, but not for fatigue. The authors state that PMR is highly effective in reducing acute feelings of stress and anxiety in patients with schizophrenia. A reduction in stress and state anxiety is associated with an increase in subjective well-being.14 Another recent RCT on efficacy of progressive muscle relaxation training in reducing anxiety assigned 18 randomized patients to experimental and control groups. The experimental group received PMR training and the control group received a placebo intervention. Results show that the anxiety level improvement was significantly higher in the PMR training group after intervention and at follow-up, and the mean Beck Anxiety Inventory score fell from moderate anxiety on the pre-test to normal anxiety on the post-test.15 Therefore, the authors state that PMR training is a potentially effective nursing intervention to reduce anxiety in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, depending on the quality of their mental status at the time of intervention.15 The recent research about development of self-control strategies and stress management aimed to verify the impact of self-control skills and a stress management programme. During nine months, 14 participants with schizophrenia took part in a psycho-educative programme based on the relaxation principles of Jacobson, Shultz, and Desoille.16 Significant differences were found between pre- and post-test evaluations, revealing a decrease in stress levels and an increase in coping strategies, especially related with “self-control”, “assuming responsibility”, and “positive re-evaluation”. Furthermore, it is relevant to comprise all possible limitations of this therapy. Despite the fact that PMR sessions were experienced with satisfaction and wellness, a certain degree of motivation is necessary to embrace the regular use of this technique on a daily or weekly basis. Most publications indicate that adverse events resulting from relaxation techniques seem to be extremely uncommon; however, patients with heart and cardiovascular diseases, as well as patients with psychiatric disorders who present positive symptoms and risk of disorientation or confusion should be treated carefully. Although there already exists a systematic review on this topic, it only includes RCT design studies, and the outcomes of psychological distress and anxiety. In this JBI protocol for Systematic Review, we intend to go beyond that, as defined in the inclusion criteria, and consider any quantitative study design, setting, and outcome that will include all scientific/standardized assessments (questionnaires or scales) of anxiety, social isolation, personal and social functioning, cognition, conversation, and well-being. Thus, this systematic literature review is considered to be timely and relevant.",

Objetivos: Revisar as características e pontos principais da migrânea. Materiais e Métodos: revisão narrativa realizada em bases de dados digitais, livros e informações de organizações de referência mundial. Resultados: A migrânea é um tipo de cefaleia primária de alta prevalência, sendo mais comum em mulheres. Pode ser com ou sem aura – sintomas neurológicos focais que precedem a dor – ou crônica. Caracteriza-se por cefaleia pulsátil, unilateral, de intensidade de moderada a grave, associada a náusea, vomito, foto ou fonofobia e que se agrava com atividades físicas rotineiras. Deve ser diferenciada de outras cefaleias primarias e, quando na presença de sinais de alarme, também das secundárias, em especial se na terceira idade. Fatores como odores e luzes fortes, consumo de bebida alcoólica, certos alimentos, jejum prolongado, distúrbios do sono e ciclo menstrual podem desencadear uma crise. Seu tratamento pode ser farmacológico ou não, além de envolver medidas gerais; e pode ser sintomático ou profilático – mais indicado em casos mais graves ou refratários. Dentre os medicamentos utilizados durante as crises há os específicos (triptanos e derivados da ergotamina) e não específicos (analgésicos e anti-inflamatórios não esteroidais). Conclusão: Conclui-se que a migrânea deve ser reconhecida e diagnosticada correta e precocemente, objetivando uma terapêutica adequada e individualizada para que se alcance uma melhora na qualidade de vida do paciente.",

      "title": "Blackout",
      "abstract": "Note that the terms ‘syncope’ and ‘loss of consciousness’ are not interchangeable as loss of consciousness can be due to either syncopal or non-syncopal causes. Syncope is a form of loss of consciousness in which hypoperfusion of the brain is the cause (from the Greek syn (together) and kopein (to cut), referring to the fact that the blood flow that joins the brain together with the rest of the body has been cut). Syncopal causes can be subdivided by mechanism as follows: • ‘Reflex’: this is believed to involve activation of a primitive reflex that leads mammals to ‘play dead’ when faced with danger. Their heart rate slows and their blood pressure drops temporarily, reducing cerebral perfusion and leading to syncope. Some people appear to have a low threshold for activating this reflex in specific situations—for example after standing still for a long time, after seeing something frightening (e.g. blood, needles), or when straining (micturition, defecation). • ‘Cardiac’: pathologies causing a reduction in cardiac output (such as arrhythmias or outlet obstruction) can also lead to syncope. • ‘Orthostatic’: orthostatic hypotension basically means low blood pressure on sitting or standing (as opposed to lying flat). When we stand up there is a sudden drop in blood pressure that we compensate for by vasoconstriction, particularly of the ‘capacitance’ veins in the legs. This reduces the intravascular space, enabling us to maintain the pressure. However, this vasoconstriction takes a few seconds, so to prevent a transient fall in blood pressure every time we stand, there is a temporary increase in heart rate. Patients with reduced intravascular volume (e.g. from dehydration) and/or in whom the normal autonomic response (transient tachycardia and peripheral vasoconstriction) to standing is blunted (e.g. due to drugs or autonomic neuropathy) are vulnerable to blackouts. • ‘Cerebrovascular’: these are non-cardiac structural causes of reduced cerebral perfusion, i.e. obstructions to the blood flow between the heart and the brain. They are relatively uncommon. The main causes of a transient loss of consciousness are summarized in Figure 3.1, with the most common in large font. You should also remember that patients may believe they have lost consciousness when in fact they haven’t.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Stimulants are sympathomimetic substances that include cocaine, amphetamines, and cathinones. Approximately 1.5% of Americans have used illicit stimulants in the past month, and approximately 61,500 deaths involved stimulant use in 2022. Acute effects include tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, and euphoria. High doses of stimulants may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, severe hypertension, agitation, myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, stroke, hyperthermia, or rhabdomyolysis. Abstinence after regular use of stimulants may lead to dysphoria, fatigue, insomnia, and agitation. People who use stimulants may present with acute effects or medical complications. Cocaine metabolites and amphetamines can be detected in urine for a few days after use. The most serious complications of acute use are cardiovascular (especially myocardial infarction, stroke) and psychiatric (agitation, delirium); the risk of hyperthermia is also increased. Contingency management has been shown to be effective for stimulant use disorder. Other psychosocial modalities may reduce stimulant use among selected individuals; these include individual and group counseling, cognitive–behavioral therapy, and community reinforcement. Medications may provide modest benefits, including bupropion with or without naltrexone, topiramate, mirtazapine, and prescription stimulants. Harm reduction interventions such as syringe exchange programs and safe consumption sites are associated with decreased complications related to stimulant use. Caffeine has mild stimulant effects and may lead to a mild dependence syndrome.",

A number of conditions other than dementia need to be considered from nyctophobia and insomnophobia, to pain, specific motor disorders during sleep, parasomnias as REM-sleep behaviour disorder, dipping, hypoglycemia, withdrawal or excessive tea, coffee and alcohol consumption. A clear-cut differential diagnosis between dementia and delirium is not always possible, as dementia is the major risk factor for confusional states decreasing the vulnerability by anticholinergic medication and any other disruptive factor, biological or psychological. Treatment of nocturnal agitation usually requires (1) reassurance and re-orientation; (2a) the discontinuation of anticholinergic substances; (2b) symptomatic psychotropic intervention; and (3) causal treatment of underlying problems. Benzodiazepines should only be used at the lowest necessary dosage for the shortest possible time, particularly in individuals who are already benzodiazepine-dependent. Quetiapine or mirtazapine at low dosages can be employed in patients with psychotic or depressive symptoms. Melatonin and its derivatives hold promise for chronic circadian rhythm disorders. There is no “one fits all” recipe for this notorious problem and each case needs to be examined individually.",

      "abstract": "Many patients experience difficulty swallowing pills, for I various reasons: * discomfort (particularly pediatric and geriatric patients) * postsurgical need for an alternate route of enteral intake (nasogastric tube, gastrostomy, jejunostomy) * dysphagia due to a neurologic disorder (multiple sclerosis, impaired gag reflex, dementing processes) * odynophagia (pain upon swallowing) due to gastroesophageal reflux or a structural abnormality * a structural abnormality of the head or neck that impairs swallowing. (1) If these difficulties are not addressed, they can interfere with medication adherence. In those instances, using an alternative dosage form or manipulating an available formulation might be required. Crushing guidelines There are limited data on crushed-form products and their impact on efficacy. Therefore, when patients have difficulty taking pills, switching to liquid solution or orally disintegrating forms is recommended. However, most psychotropics are available only as tablets or capsules. Patients can crush their pills immediately before administration for easier intake. The following are some general guidelines for doing so: (2) * Scored tablets typically can be crushed. * Crushing sublingual and buccal tablets can alter their effectiveness. * Crushing sustained-release medications can eliminate the sustained-release action. (3) * Enteric-coated medications should not be crushed, because this can alter drug absorption. * Capsules generally can be opened to administer powdered contents, unless the capsule has time-release properties or an enteric coating. The accompanying Table, organized by drug class, indicates whether a drug can be crushed to a powdered form, which usually is mixed with food or liquid for easier intake. The Table also lists liquid and orally disintegrating forms available, and other routes, including injectable immediate and long-acting formulations.

      "abstract": "The author, largely from a clinical standpoint, discusses the various ideas of negation. He points out that ideas of negation, systematic or asystematic, are very slow in appearing, and represent generally a phase of evolution of the psychoses or a secondary mental process. Their appearance coincides with the mental decadence due to chronicity or associated with senility. Certain congenital cases do not come under this class, and there is also a group in which there seems to be a “negative disposition” of the individual. From a clinical study one of the following factors is necessary to the production of these ideas: (1) a state of mental weakness produced either by an intoxication or by some other cause acting acutely, or (2) a state of acute, subacute, or chronic pathological pain, or (3) an originally degenerative condition.",

      "title": "Magnesium Deficiency. Etiology and Clinical Spectrum",
      "abstract": "Abstract Magnesium deficiency may complicate many diseases. The causes include the following: inadequate intake during starvation or increased requirement during early childhood, pregnancy, or lactation; excessive losses of magnesium as a result of malabsorption from the gastrointestinal tract or from the kidneys during use of diuretics; and to a combination of the two, as in alcoholism. Most often the etiological factors have been operative for a month or more. Acute hypo‐magnesemia can occur without previous Mg deficiency after epinephrine, cold stress and stress of serious injury or extensive surgery. The clinical manifestations depend on the age of the patient and may begin insidiously or with dramatic suddenness, or there may be no overt symptoms or signs. The manifestations can be divided into the following categories: totally non‐specific symptoms and signs ascribable to the primary disease; neuromuscular hyperactivity including tremor, myoclonic jerks, convulsions, Chvostek sign, Trousseau sign (rarely), spontaneous carpopedal spasm (rarely), ataxia, nystagmus and dysphagia; psychiatric disturbances from apathy and coma to some or all facets of delirium; cardiac arrhythmias including ventricular fibrillation and sudden death; hypocalcemia which is responsive only to Mg therapy; and hypokalemia which is not easily nor completely corrected without Mg therapy. The diversity of etiologies and the multiplicity of manifestations result in confusion and controversy. The documentation of normal renal function is absolutely necessary for maximum doses. The order of magnitude of dose is 1.0 meq Mg/kg on day 1, and 0.3 to 0.5 mEq/kg per day for 3 to 5 days. In emergencies such as convulsions or ventricular arrhythmias, a bolus injection of 1.0 gm (8.1 meq) of MgSO 4 is indicated. Therapy of Mg deficiency in the presence of renal insufficiency requires smaller doses and frequent monitoring. Complete repletion occurs slowly.",

      "title": "Differential modulation by Sigma-1 receptors of µ opioid-induced antinociception and side effects : role of periperial sigma-1 receptors",
      "abstract": "Titulo de la Tesis Doctoral: Differential modulation by sigma-1 receptors of µ- opioid-induced antinociception and side effects: Role of peripheral sigma-1 receptors\nDoctorando: Cristina Sanchez Fernandez\nIntroduccion\nLos agonistas opioides se usan en clinica como analgesicos, principalmente aquellos del subtipo µ, tales como fentanilo, oxicodona, morfina, buprenorfina y tramadol. Esta accion analgesica la producen principalmente a nivel central (p.ej. Christie et al., 2000; Khalefa et al., 2012). Ademas de la analgesia, estos farmacos producen otros efectos derivados principalmente de sus acciones a nivel central, incluyendo confusion mental y depresion respiratoria, entre otros efectos adversos de relevancia clinica (revisado en Waldhoer et al., 2004 y Al-Hasani and Bruchas, 2011). Los opioides tambien producen efectos perifericos, ya que disminuyen el transito intestinal principalmente por su efecto inhibitorio de la actividad del plexo mienterico (Holzer et al., 2009; Brock et al., 2012). Este efecto de los opioides se utiliza clinicamente para el tratamiento sintomatico de la diarrea, concretamente mediante el uso de loperamida. Este farmaco es un agonista opioide que actua exclusivamente a nivel periferico (Menendez et al., 2005), y que, por lo tanto, es capaz de inhibir el transito intestinal aunque carece de efectos centrales (Gallelli et al., 2010), por lo que no se utiliza clinicamente como analgesico.\nEl receptor sigma-1 (sigma-1) es una proteina neuromoduladora cuya farmacologia esta bien descrita en la actualidad, habiendo disponibles tanto antagonistas (BD-1063, BD-1047, NE-100 y S1RA) como agonistas (PRE-084 y (+)-pentazocina) selectivos (Cobos et al., 2008; Romero et al., 2012). Se sabe que la inhibicion del receptor sigma-1 a nivel central potencia la analgesia opioide (Mei y Pasternak, 2002 y 2007; Marrazzo et al., 2006). Sin embargo, se desconoce si este receptor es capaz de modular la analgesia opioide a nivel periferico o si su inhibicion tambien podria incrementar los efectos no analgesicos de los opioides, lo cual limitaria su utilidad clinica. Desafortunadamente, la inhibicion del transito intestinal tambien es producida por los opioides analgesicos (con penetrabilidad central) y tiene un gran impacto en la calidad de vida del paciente, ya que el estrenimiento producido por estos farmacos es la causa principal de abandono voluntario de medicacion opioide por los pacientes (Dhingra et al., 2013).\n Objetivos\nEl objetivo principal de esta Tesis fue estudiar el papel neuromodulador del receptor sigma-1 en la analgesia opioide periferica en el raton, asi como en varios efectos no analgesicos (adversos) de los opioides.\n Resultados\nLos resultados mostraron que la inhibicion genetica del receptor sigma-1 (KO-sigma-1) o farmacologica, administrando por via subcutanea (s.c.) o intraplantar (i.pl.) antagonistas selectivos sigma-1 (BD-1063, BD-1047, NE-100 y S1RA) carecia de efectos antinociceptivos por si mismo. Sin embargo, la inhibicion del receptor sigma-1 potencio el efecto analgesico de los agonistas opioides al aplicar un estimulo mecanico doloroso (450 g de presion en la pata trasera). Los ratones KO-sigma-1 tratados s.c. con opioides fentanilo, oxicodona, morfina, buprenorfina, o tramadol, mostraron un marcado aumento del efecto analgesico respecto a los ratones salvajes (WT). La administracion sistemica (s.c) de antagonistas selectivos sigma-1 a ratones WT tratados por via sistemica con dosis bajas de agonistas opioides consiguio una potenciacion similar a la registrada en ratones KO-sigma-1. El efecto de los antagonistas sigma-1 fue totalmente revertido por el agonista selectivo sigma-1 PRE-084, indicando la selectividad de los efectos observados.\nPara estudiar la importancia de los receptores opioides perifericos en el efecto analgesico de los opioides administrados por via sistemica, observado tanto en una situacion normal o de bloqueo del receptor sigma-1, se administro naloxona metiodida, un agonista opioide periferico (Menendez et al., 2005). Los resultados mostraron que la potenciacion del efecto analgesico de los opioides por la inhibicion del receptor sigma-1, era marcadamente mas sensible al antagonista periferico que la analgesia observada en una situacion normal, indicando el papel clave de los opioides perifericos en la potenciacion del efecto analgesico al bloquear el receptor sigma-1.\nAdemas, la inhibicion del receptor sigma-1 (en ratones KO-sigma-1 o mediante antagonistas sigma-1 en ratones WT) fue capaza desenmascarar el efecto analgesico de la loperamida, que en circunstancias normales no induce ningun efecto antinociceptivo. Estos datos refuerzan la importancia de la inhibicion del receptor sigma-1 en la analgesia opioide periferica.\nPosteriormente estudiamos si el bloqueo del receptor sigma-1 a nivel local era suficiente para aumentar el efecto analgesico de ratones tratados sistemicamente con dosis bajas de opioides. La administracion i.pl. de los antagonistas selectivos BD sigma-1 (BD-1063 y S1RA), potencio el efecto analgesico de los opioides solo en la pata adminsitrada, no observandose un aumento en la contralateral, confirmandose asi el efecto a nivel periferico de la inhibicion del receptor sigma-1. Esta potenciacion fue revertida por el agonista selectivo sigma-1 PRE-084 asi como por la administracion de naloxona metiodida, lo que indica que el efecto observado depende de la inhibicion del receptor sigma-1 y de la activacion de los receptores opioides perifericos.\nPor ultimo, evaluamos los efectos de la adminsitracion local (i.pl.) de morfina en ratones WT y KO-sigma-1. En ratones WT no se observo efecto alguno, mientras que en los ratones KO-sigma-1 se observo un claro efecto dosis-dependiente en la pata tratada pero no en la contralateral. Ademas, la coadministracion i.pl. de morfina con BD-1063 indujo un marcado efecto antinociceptivo comparable al de los ratones KO-sigma-1. Cabe destacar que la administracion de diversos antagonistas sigma-1 carecio de efectos en ratones KO-sigma-1, como cabria esperar, ya que su diana farmacologica esta ausente en estos animales (y confirmando la especificidad del efecto de los farmacos). Estos resultados indican que pese a que la morfina en una situacion normal no ejerce efectos analgesicos locales, estos pueden desenmascararse mediante la inhibicion de los receptores sigma-1.\nNuestros resultados obtenidos en ratones KO-sigma-1 no pueden explicarse por posibles cambios adaptativos en los receptores µ en los ratones mutantes, ya que estudios con el radioligando selectivo µ [3H]DAMGO, mostraron que los ratones de ambos genotipos poseen receptores µ farmacologicamente equivalentes (en afinidad y densidad de sitios de fijacion reconocidos por el radioligando) en tejido de cerebro, medula espinal y piel plantar. Ademas, tambien descartamos que hubiera interacciones cruzadas entre los ligandos sigma-1 y los receptores opioides, o los farmacos opioides y los receptores sigma-1, que pudieran interferir en nuestros resultados, ya que los ligandos sigma-1 no desplazaron la union del radioligando µ [3H]DAMGO, y los farmacos opioides no desplazaron la union del radioligando sigma-1 [3H](+)pentazocina.\nLa aparente importancia del receptor sigma-1 en la analgesia opioide periferica se vio respaldada por los resultados de expresion del receptor sigma-1 obtenidos mediante la tecnica de Western blot, que desvelaron una expresion del receptor sigma-1 de en torno a diez veces superior a nivel del sistema nervioso periferico (ganglios de la raiz dorsal) que a nivel central (medula espinal y diversos nucleos supraespinales).\nPese a que nuestros datos ilustran la gran importancia del receptor sigma-1 en la analgesia opioide, la hiperlocomocion y el estrenimiento inducidos por la administracion de opioides no se vieron alterados en ratones KO-sigma-1 o en WT tratados con antagonistas sigma-1. Conclusion\nConsiderando los resultados aqui resumidos, podemos concluir que la inhibicion del receptor sigma-1, tanto a nivel sistemico como local, incrementa la antinocicepcion opioide a nivel periferico frente a un estimulo mecanico, de lo que se deduce que el receptor sigma-1 es un freno biologico a la analgesia opioide periferica. Esta potenciacion de la analgesia opioide no conlleva un incremento de efectos no analgesicos centrales o perifericos (hiperlocomocion e inhibicion del transito intestinal, respectivamente) derivados de la administracion de opioides. Por lo tanto, el antagonismo sigma-1 podria tener relevancia clinica como adyuvante, a nivel sistemico o local, para incrementar la analgesia opioide sin incrementar los efectos adversos de los opioides.\n Referencias\nAl-Hasani R y Bruchas MR, Anesthesiology. 115:1363-1381 (2011).\nBrock C et al., Drugs. 72:1847-65 (2012).\nChristie MJet al., Clin Exp Pharmacol Physiol. 27:520-523 (2000).\nCobos EJ et al., Curr Neuropharmacol. 6:344-366 (2008).\nDhingra L et al., Palliat Med. 27: 447-56 (2013).\nGallelli L et al., Eur J Clin Pharmacol. 66:37-144 (2010).\nHnasko TS et al., Nature. 438:854-857 (2005).\nHolzer P, Regul Pept. 155:11-7 (2009).\nKhalefa BI et al., Eur J Pain. 16:690-705 (2012).\nMarrazzo A et al., Life Sci. 78:449-53 (2006).\nMei J y Pasternak GW, J.

Mada is considered as a prodromal phase of Unamada , or it can occur as an independent disease condition also. Mada / Madonmada is caused by various traumatic events or extreme stressors, and it is characterized by various features such as pradhyayati (immersed in thoughts/flashbacks/recurrent or persistent distressing thoughts), praswapati (excessive sleep), animittitam rodati (crying without any reason/pervasive negative emotions/depressed mood), akasmaat hasati (laughing inappropriately or without any reason/disorganized behavior), nidraalu (hypersomnia/excessive sleep), alpa vaak (diminished speech or poverty of speech/social withdrawal), nityam utsuka (hypervigilant/restlessness), trasta shareeri (tiredness/weakness), deenaaksha (depression/pervasive negative emotions), krodhana (angry outbursts/irritable behavior), nirapatrapa (self-destructive behavior/recklessness), purastaat avalokee (exaggerated startle response), na yathavritta eva (disorganized or abnormal behavior), parushatva of roma (roughness or dryness of skin and hair), and aavilam chakshusha (confused/teary eyes). Mada / Madonmada has shown similarity with various psychiatric conditions such as “acute stress disorder,” “posttraumatic stress disorder,” “brief psychotic disorder,” and “adjustment disorder.” The present study provides insights for clinical implementation of “ Mada / Madonmada ” in the diagnosis and management of “trauma- and stressor-related disorders” in terms of Ayurveda . It is astonishing that thousands of years before, “ Acharya Bhela ” has documented the conditions such as trauma- and stressor-related disorders in the form of Mada or Madonmada .",

      "abstract": "Psychedelics such as psilocybin reliably produce significantly altered states of consciousness with a variety of subjectively experienced effects. These include certain changes to perception, cognition, and affect,1 which we refer to here as the acute subjective effects of psychedelics. In recent years, psychedelics such as psilocybin have also shown considerable promise as therapeutic agents when combined with talk therapy, for example, in the treatment of major depression or substance use disorder.2 However, it is currently unclear whether the aforementioned acute subjective effects are necessary to bring about the observed therapeutic effects of psilocybin and other psychedelics. This uncertainty has sparked a lively-though still largely hypothetical-debate on whether psychedelics without subjective effects (\"nonsubjective psychedelics\" or \"non-hallucinogenic psychedelics\") could still have the same therapeutic impact, or whether the acute subjective effects are in fact necessary for this impact to be fully realized.3,4,5.",

      "title": "Unpacking agitation in practice: a call for greater precision",
      "abstract": "Agitation is a term often used by health professionals to describe patient behaviour that is regarded as problematic or disruptive. What constitutes agitation has been a topic of debate, and no unified conceptualisation prevails. Rather like terms such as ‘indigestion’, agitation may refer to completely different things when used by different clinicians. Or as famously said by Humpty Dumpty in Lewis Carroll’s Through the Looking Glass: ‘When I use a word it means just what I choose it to mean—neither more nor less’.\nA consensus statement by the International Psychogeriatric Association (IPA) [1] proposes that specific behaviours (excessive motor activity, verbal aggression, physical aggression) associated with ‘emotional distress’ have to be present for at least 2 weeks before a ‘diagnosis’ of agitation is made. This definition of agitation is limited to patients with mild-to-severe cognitive impairment, in particular dementia. Disruptive patient behaviours that are attributable to other ‘psychiatric disorders’ (e.g. psychosis), medical conditions or inadequate care do not fall under this definition of agitation. Remarkably delirium, commonly associated with agitation, is not mentioned in that statement. Perhaps this is not all that surprising as delirium is a somewhat invisible condition at bedside and organisational levels [2].",

The more frequent case is that the child suffers from being an object of symptom fabrication induced by a close person caring for the child, regularly the mother (Munchausen syndrome by proxy). This review focuses on psychopathological aspects of the clinically more relevant factitious disorder by proxy. Typical behaviour and personality characteristics are presented that can be taken as clinical warning signs. Doctor-mother-interaction is affectively challenging due to conflicting tasks imposed on the physician. Complementary to pediatric exclusion of genuine disease, psychopathological assessment is required to exclude other sources of deviant illness behaviour. Factious disorder shares particular features (active violation of the child, false report of history, aggravated symptom presentation and increased doctor-hopping, difficulties in conforming maternal report in biomedical data) with other psychopathological entities (child abuse, simulation, dissociative disorders, somatoform disorders including hypochondria, variants of maternal overprotection and infantilization, psychosis or delusion in the mother). Criteria for differentiation are presented. Three concepts on the psychopathological etiology of factitious disorder by proxy are relevant: In some cases, it may be conceived as secondary manifestation of a primary psychopathological entity or personality disorder. Learning theory emphasises operant rewards received from vicarious sick role. Attachment theory provides possible explanations concerning the traumatic impact on the child, early sources of psychopathology in the fabricating mother and risks for intergenerational transmission of factitious disorders.",

Anatomic lesions in the temporal-parietal region seem to produce formed hallucinations more frequently than lesions elsewhere (5), yet in most cases ofhallucinations no anatomic site can be found.

While its etiological bases remain obscure and consequently its nosological boundaries are uncertain, the condition classically has its onset in childhood or early adolescence [1]. It is characterized by (1) \"positive\" psychotic symptoms like delusions (fixed false ideas that are held with unshakable conviction), hallucinations (perceptions without a stimulus), and thought disorder (difficulty in assembling a coherent stream of speech); (2) so-called negative symptoms like lack of motivation and pleasure, inability of expressing the full range of emotions, neglect of personal appearance, and disinterest in life events; and (3) cognitive impairment (memory and attention difficulties) [2]. All of these attributes, persistent over time, culminate in a decline in social and occupational performance. These features – coupled with the consequences of sustained impairment – result in comorbid depression (see chapter \" Major depressive disorder \") among people with schizophrenia. Approximately 50 % of patients attempt and about 4 % of patients commit suicide. Schizophrenia is poorly understood by the public, and it is often highly stigmatizing [3].",

Both phenomenon can be due to medication or drug, or to an altered mental status. Visual hallucinations can be formed (objects, people) or unformed (light, geometric figures). They can be generated either by a lesion on the antechiasmatic pathway, by a seizure phenomenon, by a migrainous phenomenon, or by a release phenomenon secondary to visual differentiation. Investigations will be directed towards a retinopathy, an optic neuropathy, a chiasmal or retrochiasmal lesion, or a bilateral antechiasmal lesion (Charles Bonnet syndrome). Visual illusions include meta-morphopsias, micro- macropsias, polyopia, palinopsia (visual perseveration), achromatopsia, Pulfrich phenomenon, or subjective vertical deviation. Illusions can be due to lesions of the retina, the optic nerve, the visual cortex (primary or associative), or the graviceptive pathways.As most patients do not spontaneously mention their symptoms, history taking is essential. The first step is to rule out medication or an altered mental status as the possible cause of these symptoms.

A toxic effect is an adverse effect that arises through an exaggeration of the same pharmacological effect that is responsible for the therapeutic effect of the drug, for example hypokalaemia due to diuretic therapy, and is therefore dose related. A side effect is an adverse effect that arises through some pharmacological action other than that which produces the therapeutic effect; such effects may be dose related (for example anticholinergic effects of tricyclic antidepressants) or not dose related (for example a rash associated with an antibiotic). Because dose-related side effects can also be regarded as toxic effects, it is better to avoid the terms ‘toxic effects’ and ‘side effects’ and to use instead the term ‘adverse effects’, which covers all types of unwanted effects.",

There is a multidirectional continuum of anesthetic states—some represented by CNS excitation and others by depression. 2. The reticular activating system is influenced by all anesthetics; some inhibit its action (stage III) and some hyperexcite the system resulting in a function disorganization (stage II-C). 3. Some agents traverse both excitation and depression, diethyl ether (I, II, III). 4. Others induce only stage II—catalepsia, e.g. nitrous oxide, ketamine, gamma-hydroxybutyrate, alpha-chloralose, phencyclidine, trichlorethylene, and enflurane. 5. Others induce no stage II but progress directly from stage I stage III, e.g. halothane and barbiturates. 6. Cataleptic agents may induce further CNS excitation manifested by seizures, e.g. gamma-hydroxybutyrate, phencyclidine, ketamine, alpha-chloralose, trichlorethylene, and enflurane. 7. The functional definition of surgical anesthesia is: a stage induced by a drug that makes the subject relatively unresponsive to painful stimuli and amnestic. Thus, the subject does not respond during surgery and cannot recall what happened afterwards. This state can be achieved by functional disruption of CNS systems by marked stimulation or depression.",

Psychosis can be primary (functional/nonorganic) or secondary (organic), which may differ in their symptoms or presentation. The neurobiology of psychoses is complex, involving many neurotransmitters, particularly the dopaminergic system. Thorough cognitive and physical examinations, as well as laboratory testing, are necessary for the diagnosis and management of psychosis. Antipsychotic medications are the cornerstone in the management of primary psychosis (such as schizophrenia), in combination with various psychosocial strategies. Treatment of primary neurological or medical illness is more important in the management of secondary psychoses. Antipsychotic medications have different side‐effect profiles but similar efficacies, with clozapine being an exception in its superior efficacy in treatment‐resistant schizophrenia. The common adverse effects include metabolic side effects with atypical antipsychotics and neurologic (extrapyramidal) side effects with typical antipsychotics.",

Discontinuation symptoms are those that are followed by the suspension or reduction of a medication measure. They are high limitated, reversible by the drug’s reintroduction and they cannot be explained by recurrence of the disruption to which the medication was prescribed. These symptoms do not imply the dependence in medicines. Antidepressants, especially tricyclics, are known for being associated to a group of common symptoms during the discontinuation. These symptoms includes: gastric intestinal disruption and/or general factors(nauseas, vomits, abdominal pain, diarrhea, anorexia, shiverrings, malaise, weakness, tiredness, myalgias, cephalea) initial or avarege insomnia, frequently followed by dreams and/or vivid nightmares pain attacks and delirious abnormal movements(acathisia, Parkinson’s disease). The discontinuation symptoms of ive serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are several, and the most commons are generalized malaise, nauseas, cephalea, lethargy, anxiety, paresthesias, confusion, tremors, sudorese, insomnia, irritability and memory disorders. The objective of this thesis is to effect a revision of the medical literature with regard to the discontinued syndrome of antidepressants, its prevalence and main symptoms. As a result, it was found a large prevalence of discontinuation symptoms, such of TCAs as of SSRIs. Among them, the ones of shorter middle life, such as paroxetine, have more probability to cause discontinuation symptoms. The employed method consists in a survey carried out by MEDLINE in indexed medical magazines.

      "title": "Sensory and Perceptual Alterations",
      "abstract": "Sensory-perceptual alteration can be defined as when there is a change in the pattern of sensory stimuli followed by an abnormal response to such stimuli. Such perceptions could be increased, decreased, or distorted with the patient's hearing, vision, touch sensation, smell, or kinesthetic responses to stimuli. Such changes in the pattern of responses to stimuli lead to changes in a patient’s behavior, sensory acuity, decision-making process, and problem-solving abilities. This can lead to irritability, restlessness, poor concentration, fluctuating mental status, changes in communication due to inattention, and lack of focus. Furthermore, sensory deprivation in isolated patients can lead to anxiety, depression, aggression, hallucinations, and psychotic reactions. Any alteration in a patient's normal environment can result in stress especially if such alteration is involuntary. Sensory overload occurs when an individual experiences a stimulus that they are unable to manage and process. Usually, the second stimulus is filtered out by selective perception or coping behavior. However, in certain environmental conditions such as the emergency department, or due to specific underlying illnesses such as dementia, sensory overload can occur due to inadequate filtering of stimuli.Sensory deprivation occurs when an individual receives a stimulus that is reduced or below the threshold of normal. Risk factors to such alterations can be broadly due to acute illnesses, patient factors related to chronic medical conditions, aging, or due to environmental or iatrogenic causes. This typically occurs when the patient is placed in isolation, such as changes in the environment due to hospital admission or admission to isolated wards. While in isolation, there can be a reduction in the quantity and quality of stimuli and restriction of social interaction. Other risk factors that can lead to increased or decreased alteration in the processing of stimuli can be due to hearing impairment, loss of vision, loss of smell or taste, aging, trauma, electrolyte imbalance, seizure disorder, mental health problems, and genetic causes.",

The term manic-depressive illness was introduced by Emil Kraepelin (1856-1926) in the late nineteenth century.1 It is in most patients a chronic illness with recurrent manic and depressive episodes, usually alternated with periods with normal mood between the episodes. A manic episode is characterised by an elevated, expansive or irritable mood which can be accompanied by a high self-esteem, decreased need of sleep, flight of ideas or racing thoughts, increased speech, distractibility, psychomotor agitation and excessive involvement in activities with painful consequences. A hypomanic episode meets the criteria for mania but is not associated with social or occupational impairment as is the case with a manic episode. A patient with a depressed episode has a depressed mood together with the possible following symptoms: sleep disturbances, psychomotor retardation or agitation, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, impaired thinking or concentration, change of appetite or weight and suicidal thoughts.2, 3 With its manic episodes bipolar disorder differs from (unipolar) depression, which is characterized by one or more depressive episodes, but never a manic (or hypomanic) episode.",

      "title": "Hypnodiagnostic and Hypnotherapeutic Fantasy-Evocation and Acting-out Techniques",
      "abstract": "Abstract During the past five years, we have been experimenting with a number of hypnotic techniques with which to reach patients who have little or no motivation, at least at first, for psychotherapy. For the most part, these techniques have been utilized with patients with real or apparent medical or surgical disease, who had been, so far as can be judged, medically or surgically sick for five, ten or more years. The more usual interviewing techniques frequently could give us no clues, even so far as differential diagnosis (of organic from emotional disease) was concerned. As a result, techniques were devised whereby these patients were hypnotized, sometimes without their knowledge or conscious consent, but nevertheless always with their consent implied, without at any time using the word “sleep” or suggesting eye-closure, so that, by the use of other techniques still under investigation, symptoms could be precipitated or intensified even to the point of having asthmatic or epileptic attacks reproduced, for instance, during the consultation session. By still other techniques, symptom-formation was then blocked and the inevitable, resultant anxiety reaction repressed, so that underlying fantasies could erupt into conscious awareness even to the point of being acted out. An asthmatic patient, for example, when his asthmatic attack was blocked, acted out the killing of his girl friend by knocking her to the floor and jumping over and over again on her abdomen. An adolescent, with what was thought to be probable extra-pyramidal disease, began to masturbate. Examples could be multiplied almost ad inftnitum In all cases, symptoms served more than one function, and several such functions would be acted out either concurrently or one after the other. Such reactions have been utilized for the purpose of differential diagnosis, but not in the more usual sense of the term. We cannot, for instance, say that these patients do not have asthma, epilepsy, etc. By means of these techniques, however, we have found it possible to determine, and to determine rapidly, the neurotic or psychotic functions which their symptoms serve, and, in addition, to state further that, irrespective of whether or not it be asthma, epilepsy, etc., specific patients with these diagnoses can be helped and even “cured,” after having been taken partly or completely off medication, by psychiatric treatment. This can proceed in two different ways: (a) With patients who are poorly motivated toward treatment, substitute symptoms may be set up, provided they serve the same neurotic needs, or other specifically hypnotherapeutic techniques utilized. (b) Patients who can come into a good therapeutic relationship, sometimes as a result of the hypnodiagnostic procedures listed above, can then be treated both (1) by the more usual psychotherapeutic techniques, either on non-hypnotic or hypnotic levels, and, in addition, (2) by techniques made possible only by the hypnotic interpersonal relationship. Some of these, again, are acting-out techniques. There is little in the whole field of hypnotherapy that is not controversial. This applies even to a definition of hypnosis. However, from the angle of approach of the material presented in this chapter, we tentatively incline to believe that whatever else, in addition, the hypnotic interpersonal relationship is, it seems to be a fantasy-evoking one in which the patient, on the basis of his own experiential background and with more ready access to his pre-conscious, thinks, feels, experiences, reacts and even acts-out exactly as he believes the hypnotist wishes him to, projecting his own impulses, desires and fantasies to the therapist. Or—and this is of course the same thing—his reaction may negativistically be the very opposite of this. For this reason, when techniques of this type are utilized, no direct suggestion at any time is given the patient. When treatment of this type is decided upon, calculated risks must at times be taken. These include those of suicide by the patient, of collaboration by the therapist in the fantasies of his patient, and of acting-out by the patient of the fantasies of the therapist. Such pitfalls, for the most part, so it is believed, can be avoided.",

      "title": "Excited delirium syndrome",
      "abstract": "Mental health calls make up a large proportion of ambulance workloads, with paramedics responding to a wide range of presentations such as anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and excited delirium syndrome. Excited delirium syndrome is an increasingly common presentation, characterised by extreme agitation and aggression in a patient with an altered mental status. Excited delirium is a potentially life-threatening condition, with generally non-specific symptoms. Common triggers of excited delirium syndrome are acute drug use, psychiatric illness, or abrupt cessation of antipsychotic medication. It occurs when there is excessive dopamine stimulation in the striatum, combined with acute exposure to catecholaminergic psychoactive substances. A history of schizophrenia, or bipolar disorder are known risk factors for excited delirium syndrome. While agitation and aggression, concomitant with an altered mental status are the hallmark of excited delirium, other medical conditions such as hypoxia, head trauma, hypoglycaemia, hyperglycaemia, and infection can produce similar symptoms, and need to be ruled out as causes. Safety is paramount in the management of excited delirium, with the use of physical and chemical restraint being commonplace. Rhabdomyolysis often occurs when the patient is able to exercise extreme exertion against the restraints and this should be minimised to prevent the risk of cardiac arrest.",

      "title": "Clinical Practice Guidelines for Assessment and Management of Patients with Substance Intoxication Presenting to the Emergency Department",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, revision 10 (ICD-10) describes intoxication as \"a transient condition following the administration of alcohol or other psychoactive substance, resulting in disturbances in level of consciousness, cognition, perception, affect or behavior, or other psychophysiological functions and responses.\"[1] Intoxication is generally an acute phenomenon, the intensity and effects of which wear off with time and disappear completely in the absence of further use of the substance. While most episodes of intoxication do not need medical attention, intoxicated patients may sometimes present to the emergency department.[1] The reasons for seeking medical attention may either be due to the substance use itself (e.g., extreme agitation or violent behavior that may endanger the patient or others around them) or due to an adverse consequence of substance use (e.g., head injury in a road traffic accident that occurred due to driving while intoxicated). Common substances of intoxication encountered in the emergency setting in India are alcohol, cannabis, opioids, and benzodiazepines. Cases of intoxication from other substances like inhalants, stimulants, hallucinogens, and newer psychoactive substances including synthetic cannabinoids and club drugs may also present to the emergency unit. Often the substance of intoxication may be unknown or falsely reported due to fear of legal ramifications or there may be use of more than one intoxicating substance, thereby complicating the clinical picture. Patients may present with decreased levels of consciousness, vomiting, seizures, or other symptoms that may resemble other medical or surgical emergencies. It is, thus, imperative that psychiatrists attending to patients in the emergency department be well-versed with identification, assessment, and management of patients with substance intoxication.[2] Caring for intoxicated patients in the emergency department comes with various other issues that require a psychiatrist's time and effort. These patients may be brought into the emergency department against their wishes and refuse medical care. They may also be brought in for medical attention by law enforcement authorities with no available identification details and reliable history or even in association with an alleged crime or illegal activity, making it essential for the emergency care provider to be competent in dealing with the medicolegal aspects of intoxication and providing optimum medical services to the patient along with safeguarding the legal procedures. The present clinical practice guidelines deal with the assessment and management of patients with substance intoxication presenting to the emergency department. The guidelines present the general considerations while attending to a substance intoxicated patient, followed by general signs of intoxication. Thereafter, details of intoxication with specific substances are discussed, namely, alcohol, cannabis, opioids, benzodiazepines, and other substances. Features of intoxication, assessment, and management are discussed for each of these substances. Multiple substance intoxication is also discussed in the guidelines. Special populations are referred to in the guidelines, including children and adolescents, women, and the elderly population. The guidelines do not cover nicotine or caffeine intoxication (these are unlikely to be encountered in a clinical setting). Accidental ingestion of substances of use is not catered to in these guidelines. We also do not go into details of intoxication presenting with additional psychiatric and/or medical illnesses and each such case is likely to be unique with its own specific constraints and challenges in management. General considerations while attending to a substance intoxicated patient Patients with intoxication with a substance of abuse present several challenges during assessment and management [Figure 1]. One of the foremost concerns is the potential unreliability of history. Patients with substance intoxication may give inaccurate or unreliable history. This may be partly attributable to patients trying to minimize their substance use, not recollecting details adequately due to cognitive impact of the substance, concealment of the details of substance use from the family, or avoiding sharing details to prevent legal ramifications. Thus, multiple sources of information can be referred to obtain a more comprehensive account of the patient's condition. Friends, family, and previous treatment records can be useful sources of collateral information about the patient. In some circumstances, physical examination and mental status examination of an uncooperative patient can be helpful to get a clearer clinical picture of the patient (e.g., injection track marks can hint at opioid overdose in an otherwise comatose patient).Figure 1: Challenges in assessment and management of patients with substance intoxicationAnother challenge that comes across in patients with intoxication is the occurrence of agitation or violence. Some of the intoxications with substances like alcohol and stimulants like cocaine may be associated to aggression. Aggression may be due to disinhibition and impaired judgement associated with substance use. Furthermore, substance use disorder may be associated with other psychiatric or medical illnesses that may individually contribute to the state of agitation or aggression. Addressing aggression promptly is required to prevent harm to the self and others. Other relevant guidelines of the Indian Psychiatric Society may be referred to while addressing aggression and violence when patients with substance intoxication present to the emergency department. A related issue is the consumption of substances or presentation with substance intoxication when the patient intends to kill themself. This may be a presenting feature in patients with overdose of opioids or sedative-hypnotics. Sometimes, patients may also consume large amounts of alcohol when they have an intent to die. Thus, self-harm should be considered as a possibility when patients present with substance intoxication, and suitable assessment measures should ascertain risk to self and the presence of concurrent psychiatric disorder. If required, additional treatment should be instituted for the patient. A relevant aspect of consideration is to determine the line between simply the use of a substance or substance intoxication. Description in the ICD-11 mentions substance intoxication as occurrence of \"clinically significant disturbances in consciousness, cognition, perception, affect, behavior, or coordination that develop during or shortly after the consumption or administration.\"[3] Hence there is a leeway for the clinician to determine what is considered as \"clinically significant\". One way to simply operationalize is to consider any clinical encounter with a patient having a recent history of substance use which has resulted in the abovementioned mental or neuropsychiatric disturbances and are brought to the emergency/clinical setting as \"clinically significant\" (those situations where these disturbances are expected by the person and are found to be pleasurable would be considered simply as use). The disturbances are described as transient and reversible, and hence they are expected to abate with time. Patients with substance intoxication may have an issue related to their mental competence. Substance use may result in impairment of judgement or consciousness. This may result in impairment of competence, that is, the ability of the person to comprehend choices, decide a course of action, and communicate their choice back. This lack of competence has a bearing on treatment choices that should be instituted and promulgation of coerced treatment. It is generally accepted that when a person is not found to be competent, the nominated representative can be the proxy decisionmaker for the person. The treatment providers can also institute emergency treatment in the best interests of the patient. Furthermore, substance intoxication is a reversible process, so if emergency treatment is not required, then one can wait for the patient to re-attain competence as the substance intoxication wanes. A clinical consideration for patients with substance use disorders is the concurrent use of many substances together. This may lead to the clinical picture being altered or complicated by features of intoxication or withdrawal from different substances. For example, a patient with opioid dependence may experience sedation during intoxication. If benzodiazepines or alcohol are used concurrently with opioids, then the sedation may be accentuated. In such a patient, reversal using naloxone may offset the features of intoxication from opioids, but not reverse the effects of benzodiazepines. Similarly, intoxication from cocaine and other stimulants may lead to paranoia, which may be accentuated by the consumption of higher than usual amounts of cannabis. Thus, a clinician needs to be open to the idea of multiple substance consumption in a patient with substance intoxication. Another issue in the clinical management of patients with substance intoxication in the emergency setting is the potential lack of social support in the treatment process. Patients may be consuming substances alone, or it is possible that casual acquaintances do not intend to help or are not in a position to help (due to their own intoxication as well). Family and friends may be disinclined or burnt out due to the substance use disorder and hence may not be forthcoming in engaging with the care process. Thus, the ancillary supports available in the treatment process of patients with substance intoxication may be few. Sometimes, police or other bystanders may bring a patient with substance intoxication to the emergency unit and the identity of the patient may be unknown to them. Thus, clinicians may have to work with limited information on occasions. There may be legal concerns with the consumption of certain substances considered illegal under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985. This may make patients hesitant to disclose use of some of the substances; for example, heroin. Treating psychiatrists might also be apprehensive about documentation. However, it should be reiterated that clinicians can help patients better if they are able to get a reliable history of the patient. Thus, it would be preferable to gather detailed information and document suitably while ensuring confidentiality of the treatment records and providing reassurance about this to the patient. It might also be prudent to perform urine or blood testing for substance abuse, ensuring a safe chain of custody of the sample. It is unlikely that such treatment records are referred to by the legal process, but a psychiatrist may need to present the relevant information to courts when requested through due processing. General signs of intoxication As specified in the ICD-11,[3] intoxication from one or more psychoactive substances may be suspected in cases where the following features are present: Transient, but clinically significant disturbances occur in consciousness, coordination, perception, cognition, affect, or behavior that develop during or shortly after the consumption/administration of the substance(s) The symptoms are in accordance with the known pharmacological effects of the substance. The intensity of the symptoms is closely related to the amount of substance consumed/administered. The symptoms are time-limited and subside as the substance is cleared away from the body. The symptoms cannot be better explained by another medical condition or another psychiatric disorder. Table 1 enumerates signs and symptoms of intoxication with different substances.Table 1: Features of intoxication with common psychoactive substancesGeneral management of intoxicated patients in the emergency setting As mentioned earlier, patients presenting with intoxication may prove challenging to manage. Intoxicated behavior may often be confused with other disease conditions and vice versa. A brief outline on general management of a patient presenting with intoxication is given in Figure 2.Figure 2: General management of intoxicated patients in an emergency settingALCOHOL INTOXICATION IN THE EMERGENCY SETTING Alcohol (primarily) is a widely used psychoactive substance globally and in India. In people aged 20–39 years, approximately 13.5% of global deaths are attributable to alcohol. More than 200 disease and injury conditions are related to alcohol use. Data from the National Syndromic Surveillance Program of United States, which included non-fatal emergency department visits from facilities in 49 states and Washington, DC, indicated that in 2020 1.8% of the total annual emergency visits were related to alcohol use. Of the many alcohol related disorders presenting to the emergency department in India, a vast majority presents with road traffic accidents due to driving under intoxication followed by acute alcohol poisoning, which is defined as ingestion of a large amount of alcohol in a short duration of time.[4] Clinical features of alcohol intoxication Alcohol is a global central nervous system (CNS) depressant. Acute ingestion generally results in elevation of mood, disinhibition, and increased confidence, leading to argumentative or combative behavior. In addition to those mentioned in Table 1, some features of alcohol intoxication seen with increasing blood alcohol concentration (BAC) are discussed in Table 2. In naïve drinkers, BAC of 150–250 mg per 100 ml result in clinically apparent intoxication; BAC of 350 mg per 100 ml cause stupor and coma; while levels more than 450 mg per 100 ml can be fatal. Regular users of alcohol often develop tolerance and are significantly less likely to manifest symptoms/signs of intoxication at the same BAC than non-regular drinkers.[5] Effects can last from 2 to 3 hours after a few drinks to up to 24 hours after heavy drinking.Table 2: Effects of increasing blood alcohol concentrationAssessment of alcohol intoxication An asssessment of a patient presenting with alcohol intoxication aims at identifying the immediate risks to the patient and attendants and uncovering maladaptive patterns of alcohol use that may require specialized management and care. Acute alcohol intoxication may result in several metabolic abnormalities, like hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypophosphatemia, and hypocalcemia. Thus, these may be required on an urgent basis. Alcohol can cause acute effects on the cardiovascular system, such as atrial and ventricular tachy-dysrhythmias. Hence, an urgent electrocardiogram (ECG) may be required. Further discussed are the assessment measures for alcohol intoxication: Clinical history Elicit details of current episode of alcohol use: amount, preparation, duration, mixing with other substances, etc. Ask for similar details about previous drinking episodes. Elicit, wherever possible, events of high-risk behavior under intoxication: driving, operating heavy machinery, self-harm, or violence toward others. Attempt should be made, wherever possible, to identify alcohol dependence or harmful use pattern. Physical Examination Assess levels of consciousness (the Glasgow Coma Scale may be used), cardiac and respiratory parameters (heart rate, blood pressure, cardiac rhythm, respiratory rate), and urine output, if possible, with hourly intervals until parameters begin to normalize. Unresponsive patients may suffer from an occult head injury that may be identified from increased intracranial pressure. It is thus advised to perform a direct ophthalmoscopy looking for papilledema, which is a clinical sign for increased intracranial pressure. Papilledema without increased intracranial pressure may also be seen in methyl alcohol poisoning. Thus, imaging (CT/MRI) may be required to determine definitive management. In responsive patients, rule out diplopia and assess eye movements in all cardinal positions, any muscle weakness, and sensory deficits. Observe for any abnormal or involuntary movements. Check for other physical injuries and bleeding from the ear, nose, or mouth. Mental status examination Assess for speech and behavioral abnormalities; pay special attention to aggressive behaviors, and ensure patient and staff safety. Assess thought and perceptual disturbances. Assess orientation to time and place: immediate, recent, and remote memory, insight, and reality testing. Rule out other causes of altered sensorium: Metabolic causes such as hypoglycemia, electrolyte imbalance, hyperosmolar hypoglycemic state, diabetic ketoacidosis, and metabolic acidosis may be detected by laboratory investigations including blood glucose, renal function tests, and arterial blood gases. Cerebral trauma, cerebrovascular events, and meningitis may be identified by computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis. Encephalopathies and toxicity from other substances (methanol, lithium, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, and isoniazid) may be identified through laboratory investigations for serum ammonia, and levels of suspected agents in the blood. Higher serum levels than the therapeutic window indicates toxicity. The abovementioned assessments and investigations are based on individual case considerations and clinical suspicion. MANAGEMENT OF ALCOHOL INTOXICATION IN THE EMERGENCY SETTING Individuals with some symptoms of alcohol intoxication (mild and moderate cases, i.e., without impairment of consciousness or significant medical issues) can be managed in relatively simple surroundings without much medical intervention. Those who are severely intoxicated should be admitted and further managed in a setting where high-dependency or intensive care can be provided.[4,6] Treatment for acute alcohol toxicity is largely supportive. The first priority is airway protection and maintenance of breathing as respiratory depression due to alcohol intoxication may result in death. Alcohol acts as a diuretic; thus, patients with signs of dehydration (dry lips and mucosae and poor urine output) may be provided with intravenous fluids. Checking glucose is important, as many individuals with alcohol use disorder may have depleted glycogen stores. Hypoglycemia needs to be corrected with 5% dextrose intravenously. Routine use of vitamins is not necessary for all cases of alcohol intoxication. However, thiamine supplementation is needed for patients with alcohol dependence to prevent the occurrence of Wernicke encephalopathy. Thus, prophylactic thiamine may be administered to patients who appear at risk of developing thiamine deficiency (prolonged use of alcohol, poor nutritional status, confused mental state, gait abnormalities, and ophthalmoplegia).[7] Usual dose should be at least 250 mg of thiamine daily intramuscularly for 3–5 days, followed by oral thiamine 100 mg daily.[8] It is important to remember that in an emergency setting, thiamine is to be administered before glucose replenishment so that the glucose is utilized in ATP generation (which utilizes thiamine as a co-factor), preventing sequestration of the already limited thiamine which may precipitate Wernicke's encephalopathy. A brief schematic flowchart for management of alcohol intoxication in the emergency setting is presented in Figure 3.Figure 3: Management of alcohol intoxication in an emergency setting General management Maintain airway, breathing, and circulation. Provide intravenous fluids to counter dehydration and maintain urine output. Hypoglycemia should be corrected with oral glucose, if conscious level permits, or else with 5% or 10% intravenous (IV) dextrose. Maintain ambient room temperature, with quiet surroundings and minimal disturbance. At least one electrocardiogram (ECG) should be obtained for all heavily intoxicated patients and for those with known cardiovascular conditions. \"Holiday heart syndrome\" characterized by new-onset arrhythmias/atrial fibrillation can occur following alcohol ingestion. Serial ECG monitoring should be done if arrhythmia is detected. As intoxication abates, ECG changes should resolve, but if the changes persist an alternate cause should be considered. In the case of altered mental status, when a full history cannot be elucidated from the patient, a CT scan of the head can be considered for detecting intracranial pathology contributing to the patients' mental status (e.g., subdural hematoma). MRI can also be considered for select cases. If suicidality is expressed, then psychiatric evaluation should be considered. Laboratory investigations Blood glucose, plasma electrolytes, and blood gases should be measured as frequently as possible in patients with altered sensorium until recovery is assured. Urine toxicology may be performed, if needed, to check for presence of narcotics and sedatives, if suspected. Complete blood counts can be done to detect megaloblastic anemia. Liver function tests should be done when prolonged harmful pattern of alcohol use is suspected. Renal function tests should be done in cases of altered sensorium, poor urine output, or if behavioral features are out of proportion to the amount of alcohol consumed. Blood alcohol levels may be required in medicolegal cases when reliable history is not available or when behavioral features are out of proportion to the amount of alcohol consumed. Whole blood thiamine levels may be measured in patients at risk of or suspected to develop Wernicke's encephalopathy. Symptomatic management Control aggression by adopting a concerned and non-threatening demeanor. Sedatives should be used judiciously to avoid over-sedation. Metadoxine (given as a single IV/intramuscular [IM] injection of 300–600 mg) may be used to accelerate the elimination of alcohol in adults leading to faster recovery from intoxication. In cases of agitation or violence, antipsychotics (haloperidol 5 mg with promethazine 50 mg) should be considered. In-patient admission of a patient with alcohol intoxication can be considered when there is severe intoxication, medical complications such as Wernicke's encephalopathy, alcoholic hepatitis, dysrhythmias or convulsions, persistent disorientation, continued abnormality in cardiopulmonary parameters, known chronic systemic illnesses that require medical attention independently, prolonged aggressive behavior, or perceptual abnormalities. The specialty under which the patient needs to be admitted can be determined according to the indication for admission. CANNABIS INTOXICATION IN THE EMERGENCY SETTING Cannabis is the most common illicit substance of abuse in India. Cannabis intoxication sometimes presents to the emergency setting after consumption (either inhalational or oral) of high amounts of cannabis. It usually presents in those who have never tried cannabis before and experience severe psychiatric or medical manifestation of cannabis consumption. Sometimes, regular cannabis users may also experience symptoms and signs of cannabis intoxication when they are introduced to a cannabis product of higher potency. Cannabis intoxication manifests with several symptoms as mentioned in Table 3.[9] There can be several physical symptoms of cannabis intoxication. These include tachycardia, tachypnea, increased blood pressure, dry mouth, nystagmus, increased appetite, and, rarely, precipitation of arrhythmias, angina, or myocardial infarction. Rarely, deep inhalation or breath holding may lead to pneumomediastinum or pneumothorax. Marked perceptual and mental status changes can be observed in cases of cannabis intoxication. These can include alteration in perception of time, with the perceived time being faster than clock time. Music is perceived as more engrossing and colors may appear brighter. There may be hallucinations, primarily auditory ones. There can be a sense of depersonalization. One may become more self-conscious, and may manifest paranoid thinking or delusions (persecutory, referential, or grandiose). Cannabis intoxication affects cognition and psychomotor performance as well. There may be motor incoordination and impaired attention and concentration. Judgment may be impaired due to cannabis intoxication.Table 3: Features of cannabis intoxicationThe cognitive and psychomotor features of intoxication may not be immediately apparent and may manifest up to three hours after consumption of the cannabis product. This may lead novice users to consume higher amounts and experience dysphoria, anxiety, perceptual alterations, and cognitive changes to a higher than anticipated extent. These features of intoxication may last even for 12 to 24 hours after the consumption of cannabis due to accumulation in the adipose tissue and gradual release afterwards. Assessment of patients with cannabis intoxication The assessment of cannabis intoxication is through elaboration of the history and conduct of the examination, supplemented with urine drug screening. Patients presenting to the emergency department with panic attacks or psychotic symptoms after cannabis usage can describe their psychopathology. Attempts should be made to assess the consumption of cannabis products prior to occurrence of such symptoms. Sometimes, friends and family members can provide corollary information. A physical examination that reveals bilateral conjunctival injection without itchiness or pain may indicate cannabis intoxication. A high degree of suspicion may be necessary as the patient may not be forthcoming with proper history, fearing legal or social repercussions. Urine enzyme-linked immunodorbet assay (ELISA) tests might provide objective information about consumption of cannabis, as cannabis remains in the body and is excreted in the urine for at least three days in infrequent consumers and for an even longer duration for regular users. One has to be cautious about urine false positives for cannabis due to efavirenz and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) such as ibuprofen and naproxen. Differential diagnosis of cannabis intoxication may include intoxication with other substances of use like cocaine, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), MDMA (ecstasy), amphetamines, and synthetic cannabinoids. When a patient presents with psychiatric symptoms like hallucinations, delusions, or panic attacks, one should evaluate for the exacerbation of a preexisting psychiatric illness like schizophrenia, acute and transient psychotic disorder, or panic disorder. Management of cannabis intoxication in the emergency setting Management of cannabis intoxication in the emergency setting can be initiated with placing the patient in a dimly lit space, reassuring them, and decreasing stimulation. In most cases, the intoxication would fade in a few hours. The patient may be given benzodiazepine orally if the patient is accepting the medication orally. Clonazepam 0.5 mg or lorazepam 1 mg can be given in such a situation. If the patient is agitated or violent, then appropriate measures should be taken for the management of agitation or violence. This may include use of antipsychotics (like haloperidol 5 mg with promethazine (Phenergan) 25 mg, given intravenously or intramuscularly), or cautious and limited use of restraints. In cases of chest pain, the patient should be evaluated for cardiac or pulmonary etiological causes. These may focus on myocardial infarction, angina, arrhythmia, pneumothorax, or pneumomediastinum, or evaluation of exacerbation of asthma. ECG or X-rays coupled with referral to cardiologists/pulmonologists or medicine specialists would be useful. Once the patient recovers from cannabis intoxication, they should be debriefed and offered counseling, providing information about harms associated with cannabis use. If a cannabis use disorder is identified (harmful use or dependence), then the patient should be suitably referred for further treatment of substance use disorder. OPIOID INTOXICATION IN THE EMERGENCY SETTING Opioids are highly dependence-producing substances. Opioids used commonly include both pharmaceutical ones (used generally in the form of medications such as methadone, buprenorphine, tramadol, and pentazocine), and non-pharmaceutical ones (generally used for recreational purposes like heroin and raw opium). Intoxication with opioids can be intentional (a patient may be taking increased amounts of opioids to experience a more intense high or as an attempt to harm oneself) or unintentional (a patient may be unable to know the potency of street heroin and hence may inject higher doses of it). There are several risk factors for opioid intoxication or overdose that have been reported in the literature.[10] These include escalating doses of opioids, combination of opioids and sedative drugs, use of opioids after a period of cessation, and presence of comorbid conditions like HIV, depression, and liver disease. Opioid intoxication is defined as a condition of transient and clinically significant disturbances in consciousness, perception, behavior, cognition, affect, or coordination that develop during or shortly after the consumption or administration of opioids. Presenting features include somnolence, stupor, psychomotor retardation, slurred speech, mood changes (euphoria followed by dysphoria), respiratory depression, and impaired memory and attention. Pupillary constriction is generally present. The intensity of these symptoms is related to the amount of opioids consumed, and in severe intoxication, coma may occur. These symptoms are not better accounted by the presence of another medical condition or presence of intoxication or withdrawal of another substance. Opioid intoxication can be classified as mild, moderate, or severe on the basis of the level of psychophysiologi",

      "title": "Forensic psychiatry approach to mental disorders resulting from substance abuse",
      "abstract": "In the last few decades, mental disorders resulting from substance abuse have become a frequent phenomenon, which features diverse forms and degrees of severity. In addition to being a medical and extremely harmful social phenomenon, substance abuse (commonly known as drug or narcotics abuse) is frequently a subject matter of research in many sciences or scientific disciplines, such as medicine, psychology, sociology, legal science, etc. Drug abusers may develop diverse mental disorders, which largely depends on the type of psychoactive substance which is being abused and the method of taking narcotics (including frequency, daily dose, mode of administration, etc.). In this paper, the author provides an overview of different types of mental disorders according to the applicable International Classification of Mental and Behavioral Disorders. The disturbance of mental functions due to drug abuse (which may or may not result in the development of a mental disorder) changes the perception and behaviour of drug users. The disturbance of mental functions becomes particularly prominent in the circumstances where substance abuse has turned into a drug addiction; the basic characteristic of the dependence syndrome is an irresistible urge (craving or even compulsion) to take the substance in order to enjoy its effects again or to avoid/relieve the drug addiction crisis or the abstinence syndrome, which may be extremely painful and agonizing. As a consequence of these mental disturbances and other disorders arising from drug addiction, human behaviour may be disrupted to such an extent that a person may demonstrate some criminal conduct, which ultimately makes these mental disorders highly relevant in the field of criminal law. Given the fact that the criminal offender is a drug abuser who may have different forms of mental disorders, there is a need to consider the offender's mental capacity (sanity), which ultimately makes these mental disorders highly relevant from the point of view of forensic psychiatry. The author's primary goal in this paper is to present the basic postulates underlying the perception of drug abuse and drug addiction in forensic psychiatry, both from the theoretical and practical point of view. In exploring the practical aspect of this issue, the author focuses on presenting the basic principles of forensic-psychiatric expertise of criminal offenders who have been diagnosed as having mental disorders caused by drug abuse. The expertise includes different aspects of assessing mental disorders: giving professional opinions on the offender's mental capacity (sanity), assessing the potential danger of recidivism or commission of a more serious criminal act, and giving proposals for relevant of security measures concerning the mandatory treatment of drug addicts both in outpatient clinics and in other relevant in-patient medical institutions. Given the fact that mental disorders stemming from drug abuse frequently have numerous financial, family and professional implications, the author presents some forensic psychiatric attitudes pertaining to the assessment of contractual capacity of these persons, the assessment of their working capacity (including the remaining working ability or temporary inability to work), the assessment of mental capacity for exercising the parental right or custodianship rights. In that context, the author provides the forensic psychiatric aspects of these mental disorders from the aspect of civil law. Drug abuse and drug addiction involve serious and complex socio-pathological problems which are difficult to treat/cure. This paper is the author's contribution to casting light on these issues, primarily from the aspect of forensic psychiatry.",

      "title": "Refining cause of death attribution among opioid, opioid‐stimulant and stimulant acute toxicity deaths",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background and aims Deaths attributed to a combination of opioids and stimulants have risen dramatically in recent years, largely attributed to fentanyl, yet little is understood about which drug class is primarily responsible. Attributing death to acute substance toxicity is complex and lacks clear standards. We aimed to determine whether additional causes of death and other significant conditions among deaths attributed to fentanyl were similar regardless of stimulant involvement, and distinct from deaths involving stimulants without opioids. Design Cross‐sectional analysis using records from the California Electronic Death Registration System. Setting and cases Unintentional acute toxicity deaths involving fentanyl or stimulants (methamphetamine or cocaine) occurring in San Francisco, USA, during 2013–2023. Measurements We compared demographic characteristics and causes of death or other significant conditions (cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, other medical cause, or no other additional cause) among five mutually exclusive groups of deaths: stimulants without opioids (stimulant‐only), fentanyl with stimulants (fentanyl‐stimulant), fentanyl without stimulants (fentanyl‐only), other opioids (e.g., heroin, oxycodone) with stimulants (“other opioid‐stimulant”), and other opioids without stimulants (“other opioids‐only”). We conducted separate unadjusted and adjusted multivariable logistic regression models for each outcome (cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, other medical, or no additional cause). The primary analysis included results for the fentanyl groups. Findings Of 4475 deaths attributed to acute opioid and/or stimulant toxicity, 24% involved stimulants‐only, 45% fentanyl‐stimulants, and 12% fentanyl‐only; the remaining 20% involved other opioids. Stimulant‐only decedents were the oldest (mean age 54 years), followed by fentanyl‐stimulant (47 years) and fentanyl‐only (44 years; p &lt; 0.001 for all). The adjusted odds of having cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, or other medical causes of death (adjusted odds ratios [aORs] from 0.03 to 0.52, with 95% confidence intervals [CIs] from 0.01 to 0.68) were lower and the odds of no additional cause of death (aORs from 2.53 to 3.31, with 95% CIs from 2.00 to 3.40) were higher for both groups of deaths involving fentanyl compared with deaths attributed to stimulants‐only. There were no statistically significant differences in causes of death when comparing fentanyl‐only with fentanyl‐stimulant deaths. Findings were similar for other opioid deaths. Conclusion In San Francisco, USA, causes of death and other significant condition characteristics among deaths attributed to fentanyl appear to be similar regardless of the involvement of stimulants, but are markedly different from deaths involving stimulants without opioids. When reporting on drug‐related mortality and developing interventions, deaths attributed to a combination of fentanyl and stimulants may be appropriately considered in the context of opioid overdose prevention, while deaths attributed to stimulants without opioids may require a response focused on preventing and treating underlying chronic medical conditions.",

      "title": "Finding Genes for Parkinsonism",
      "abstract": "__Abstract__\r\n\r\nThe term parkinsonism refers to a neurological syndrome defined by the combination of\r\nbradykinesia (slowness of movement) in combination with any of the following motor signs: tremor\r\nat rest, muscular rigidity, and loss of postural reflexes (1). This is an etiologically heterogeneous\r\nentity, which might be due to dysfunctions at various levels in the basal ganglia, and especially\r\nin the substantia nigra (SN) and striatum. The parkinsonism can be classified into four broad\r\ncategories: (i) Parkinson's disease (PD, MIM#168600), also called primary parkinsonism, or typical\r\nparkinsonism, which includes the common, idiopathic form, and the rare forms with a recently\r\ndefined genetic etiology; (ii) parkinsonism-plus syndromes, which include different idiopathic,\r\nbut atypical neurodegenerative forms of parkinsonism (additional motor neurologic features are\r\npresent); (iii) secondary parkinsonism, which is caused by known, non-genetic etiologies, such as\r\nenvironmental insults (drugs, toxins, viruses), inflammation, tissue infiltration/compression or\r\nischemia; (iv) parkinsonism in the context of other degenerative disorders, with or without a known\r\ngenetic cause, in which parkinsonism represents a minor, or occasional component of the clinical\r\npicture (table 1 ).\r\nIn the primary forms of parkinsonism (PD) the initial symptoms occur typically in one side of\r\nthe body, spreading in a few years to the contralateral side. However, a certain degree of clinical\r\nasymmetry persists during the more advanced phases of the disease (the body side where\r\nthe symptoms started remains the more severely affected). Moreover, these motor symptoms\r\ndisplay typically a substantial beneficial response to the therapy with levodopa. While the motor\r\nsymptoms dominate the clinical picture, many PD patients have also other, non-motor problems,\r\nsuch as fatigue, depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances, constipation, bladder and other autonomic\r\ndisturbances, and sensory complaints (2).\r\nThe diagnosis of primary parkinsonism (PD) remains based on the presence of the clinical\r\nsyndrome, and the exclusion of other (secondary) causes.",

      "title": "Migraine without Aura -Towards a New Definition",
      "abstract": "Objective: To quickly diagnose migraine without aura in a busy practice clinical in India and other developing countries. Background: Differentiating migraine from episodic tension type headaches is difficult if one strictly follows International classification of headache disorders- 3rd edition beta version (ICHD 3 Beta), as there are many overlapping statements. Another problem is applying criterion E, not better accounted for by another ICHD 3 beta diagnosis. Duration, presence of head pain and associated migraine diagnostic symptoms except vomiting and nausea are not mandatory to diagnose Episodic syndromes that may be associated with migraine (ICHD 3 Beta code 1.6) or Periodic syndromes (ICHD2) that are commonly precursors of migraine. Methods: A retrospective chart review was done on 6,200patients. All were diagnosed as Migraine without aura, Probable migraine or Benign secondary headaches, and the following four common features were identified- recurrent headaches / activity affected / absolutely normal in between episodes/ no red flags present. History of two more additional helpful diagnostic features was also noted - Common migraine triggers precipitating these headaches and family history of migraine or its synonyms. Exclusion criteria include aura, autonomic manifestations, headaches lasting more than 3 days, headaches with migraine features that are not activity dependent, post dromal symptoms, fever and other systemic disorders. Results: 92% of patients fulfilled the four simple migraine diagnostic features. 88% had one of the common migraine triggers precipitating their headaches and 91% had family history of migraine. Conclusion: Recurrent activity affected headaches with absolute normality in between episodes and without any red flags, should lead one to consider the diagnosis of migraine without aura.",

They fall under three main categories: psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants. Muscle spasms, aggressive behaviour, convulsions, and in some cases unconsciousness, are among the dangers associated with their use. Hallucinogenics are largely classified as schedule 1 drugs, and thus are considered to have no therapeutic value. However, global research into their therapeutic potential for conditions such as depression, addiction, post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety is ongoing. This article aims to shed light on the risks associated with hallucinogenic substances, how this may present in primary care, and how they may be used in medicine in the future.",

      "abstract": "Clinical entities listed as mood disorders in DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association 2013) relevant to depression in elderly patients include 1) bipolar disorder, 2) major depressive disorder (with or without psychotic features), and 3) persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia). Of note, two key changes in DSM-5 pertinent to older adults are elimination of minor depression from the appendix and elimination of the bereavement exclusion criterion for major depression. In a helpful addition, the DSM-5 major depression criteria now include a \"note\" on the relationship between depressive symptoms and response to significant loss. Depressive symptoms are likewise present in other DSM-5 disorders, such as adjustment disorder with depressed mood and mood disorder due to a general medical condition (see Table 5–1 ). Subtypes of depression and bipolar disorder in later life Depressive disorders Major depression, single episode or recurrent episode Psychotic depression Persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) Adjustment disorder with depressed mood Substance/medication-induced depressive disorder Depressive disorder due to another medical condition Other specified depressive disorder Unspecified depressive disorder Bipolar and related disorders Bipolar I disorder Bipolar II disorder Cyclothymic disorder Substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder Bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition Other specified bipolar and related disorder Unspecified bipolar and related disorder A bipolar I disorder diagnosis describes a condition in which a patient has experienced at least one manic episode with or without history of a depressive episode. A manic episode is defined as an alteration in mood that is euphoric, expansive, or irritable; lasts for at least 1 week; and occurs with three other associated symptoms (e.g., decreased need for sleep, increased energy, racing thoughts, pressured speech, increased behaviors that may have high likelihood for bad outcome). Manic episodes in later life also may present with a mixture of manic, dysphoric, and cognitive symptoms, with euphoria being less common (Post 1978). When mania is associated with significant changes in cognitive function—so-called manic delirium—it may be difficult to distinguish from organic conditions or schizophrenia (Shulman 1986). A diagnosis of bipolar II disorder can be made when a patient has experienced one or more depressive episodes accompanied by at least one hypomanic episode. A hypomanic episode is defined as at least 4 days of altered mood (expansive, euphoric, irritable) occurring with at least three other associated symptoms (see above). Bipolar disorder not otherwise specified is defined as disorders with bipolar features that do not meet the criteria for specific bipolar disorders.",

OBJETIVO: contribuir para um maior conhecimento do profissional fonoaudiólogo sobre as causas, consequências, diagnóstico e formas de tratamento da apneia obstrutiva do sono (AOS), a fim de favorecer a definição da conduta por este profissional, seja ela, encaminhar para um diagnóstico, tratar (por meio de fonoterapia) essa patologia ou indicar o tratamento médico, seja ele, cirúrgico ou conservador. CONCLUSÃO: as possíveis alterações fonoaudiológicas encontradas nestes pacientes são: língua alargada apresentando hipotonia, palato mole com volume aumentado, dificuldade na alimentação devido ao aporte insuficiente de ar e ao bruxismo, possivelmente causado pela tensão e ansiedade decorrentes das noites mal dormidas. Outras alterações podem ser encontradas decorrentes do tratamento cirúrgico empregado em alguns casos, como a disfagia ou até mesmo alterações na fala e na ressonância da fala decorrente de uma uvulopalatoplastia. O enfoque do tratamento fonoaudiológico é a mioterapia dos músculos envolvidos, priorizando a musculatura palatal. Percebe-se que o fonoaudiólogo pode contribuir para amenizar os sintomas encontrados nestas patologias, proporcionando uma qualidade de vida melhor aos seus portadores.",

      "abstract": "Formal thought disorder (FTD), studied even before the inception of the concept of schizophrenia, remains a deeply isolating experience for patients as well as a difficult one for their interlocutors, including clinicians. The views on language, paralinguistic, and extralinguistic features exhibited by patients with severe mental ill health are reviewed, including the contributions from 19th-century European authors to the last third of the 20th century. Stages in the construction of FTD are described, including its merging with Dementia Praecox, and its subsequently being shaped by notions such as primitive archaic thinking, paralogical or autistic thinking, concretism, overinclusive thinking, and the return of the efforts to describing it with increased reliability. It appears that some features of communication in schizophrenia, but not others, have been selected at different points in time for clinical and research use without realizing that by carrying out that selection, the phenomenon under study itself is changed. Remarkably, some theories of FTD remained in use, despite being empirically disproved (eg, word association disorder, concrete thinking, paralogical thinking) or despite its highly problematic and discriminatory nature. We would suggest that studies of FTD should explicitly consider which and why some of its features are included or excluded when assessing it. Furthermore, we would suggest that the study of FTD should incorporate the complexity of human communication, including the pragmatic, paralinguistic, non-verbal, and cognitive dimensions of the localized and unique situation where it takes place.",

Insomnia is commonly classified according to different criteria including the time of onset during the night (beginning, middle or end), its course of evolution (occasional, short term or chronic) and the severity of the complaint. The presence of associated signs is a decisive feature in characterising insomnia: it may be isolated or associated with other symptoms. Thus insomnia may evolve in its own right or be part of the framework of a somatic disorder (algic or dyspnoeic, for example) or psychiatric (anxiety disorder, mood disorder, psychose, state of confusion or dementia).",

      "title": "Drug Dependency",
      "abstract": "The legal and illegal use of psychoactive drugs, including stimulants, hypnotics, tranquilizers, and hallucinogens, is markedly increasing. Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) may cause severe acute or chronic symptoms; one cannot predict adverse reactions or relate them to frequency and length of LSD use. Among its effects are acute psychologic changes, including psychosis; and chronic alterations, such as apathy, psychosis, and \"flashback.\" Chlorpromazine is recommended for treatment of symptoms; psychotherapy and education help prevent further LSD use. Chronic amphetamine use may lead to toxic psychosis, confusion, or brain damage; acute withdrawal may lead to depression, with suicidal ideation, and increases in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep with nightmares and insomnia. Chronic use of barbiturates and nonbarbiturate hypnotics may lead to mental impairment, motor incoordination, and depression. Withdrawal produces weakness, irritability, and occasionally convulsions or psychosis. Amphetamines and hypnotics should be withdrawn gradually and patients educated as to possible physiologic alterations, both those patients dependent on large doses and those who have taken therapeutic doses for some months. Withdrawal of these drugs leads to marked increases in REM sleep, nightmares, and insomnia, which may lead to drug dependency. Marijuana may change time sense and visual and auditory perceptions. Chronic use frequently indicates underlying psychologic disturbances needing psychotherapy. Psychoactive drugs differentially affect responses of various autonomic systems. Central nervous system (CNS)-active drugs do not induce only one condition and cannot be simply classified as excitants or depressants. The physiologic alterations produced by psychoactive drugs are basic to drug dependency as are personality factors.",

      "abstract": "BackgroundInfusion reactions may mimic drug hypersensitivity, with a spectrum of variability and heterogeneity for both individual and drug; symptoms may include anxiety, diaphoresis, rigors/chills, fever, pruritus, urticaria, angioedema, headache, nausea, emesis, diarrhea, chest pain, dyspnea, wheezing/bronchospasm, hypoxia, respiratory failure, hypotension, and death [1][2][3][4].Symptoms usually occur shortly after the infusion begins but can have delayed onset [1][2][3][4].Symptoms may decrease when the infusion rate is discontinued or slowed; at other times, the symptoms persist [1][2][3][4].To add to the complexity surrounding infusion reactions, multiple nomenclatures are used, including drugmediated hypersensitivity, infusion-related toxicity, cytokine storm, cytokine-release syndrome, anaphylactoid reaction, and serum sickness-like illness [2,[4][5][6][7][8].The spectrum of symptoms, variable onset, and the multiple names implicate the immune system.Recognizing the molecular and ontologic mayhem surrounding infusion reactions, we used software technology to investigate drugs highly associated with infusion reactions.Advances in information technology allow data integration at many levels; molecular pathways can be visualized through dependency graphs and statistical modeling [9].MASE (Molecular Analysis of Side Effects) was developed by Molecular Health to connect biomolecules, pathways, targets and diseases in a drug-centric manner.Drugs highly associated with infusion reactions are reported by MASE using Proportional Reporting Ratios (PRRs).PRRs are calculated by the ratio of the observed to the expected number of drug-event pairs.The Empirical Bayesian Geometric Mean (EBGM) value is the PRR adjusted AbstractObjective: Infusion reactions can be serious life threatening adverse events and have been associated with many drugs and biologic agents.Our objective was to report drugs associated with infusion reactions using two different data-mining methodologies. Methods:The Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) was data-mined for drugs highly associated with infusion reactions.Drugs were included if there were >10 reported adverse events and if the Empirical Bayesian Geometric Mean (EBGM) score ≥ 2. Molecular Health's MASE (Molecular Analysis of Side Effects) reports Proportional Reporting Ratios (PRR) for drugs highly associated with infusion reactions and was cross-referenced to improve detection sensitivity.Results: Using FAERS, the highest EBGM scores by class were reported as: pegloticase and α-1antitrypsyn (enzymes), iron dextran and ferric gluconate (electrolytes and nutrients), infliximab and gemtuzumab (immunomodulators), and paclitaxel and oxaliplatin (antimetabolites).Using MASE, the highest PRR scores were reported as: idursulfase and galsulfase (enzymes), iron dextran and phytonadione (electolytes and nutrients), gemtuzumab and infliximab (immunomodulators), mercaptopurine and azathioprine (antimetabolites).Amphotericin and vancomycin had the highest scores for the antimicrobial class for both FAERS and MASE. Conclusions:Using the two statistical methods EBGM and PRR, both specificity and sensitivity were preserved.However, neither system detected several drugs with established relationships to infusion reactions, including protamine and nitroglycerine.Reactions caused by these drugs were possibly underreported because the effects have been well established or due to evolution of administration with slower administration.We hope this analysis encourages further research into overlapping mechanisms for infusion reactions.",

The classic form, primary delusional infestation, develops without any known cause or underling illness and meets criteria for a persistent delusional disorder (ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, 10th revision)) or delusional disorder somatic type (DSM-5 ( Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , fifth edition)). Approximately 60% of patients, however, have secondary forms of delusional infestation2 that occur in the context of substance misuse (such as cocaine, amphetamines, cannabis), dopaminergic medications, antibiotics, or during physical or psychiatric illnesses (such as delirium, dementia, depression, schizophrenia, stroke, and other medical conditions that affect the brain or cause pruritus).1 2\n\nThe neurobiology of delusional infestation is not fully understood.

Secondary xerostomia to hyposalivation can also result in dental caries, oral fungal infections such as candidiasis, changes in taste, bad breath or burning mouth sensation. Dental caries is a major cause of tooth loss among young group. The loss of one or several teeth can cause functional of mastication, speech and aesthetic disorders that can affect a person's quality of life. This study aims to determine the correlation of paranoid schizophrenic psychotic disorders to partial tooth loss in patients at Banda Aceh Mental Hospital. The method of acquiring the data were delivered by Non-Probability Sampling that use Purposive Sampling method obtained by 24 subjects. Data which obtained from the study were analyzed by the Chi-Square Test to see the correlation of partial tooth loss in paranoid schizophrenic patients with the effect of duration in medication treatment , gender and medication consumed. The results indicate that the gender variable did not provide significant results because of the p = 1.000. Nevertheless the variable of duration in medication treatment indicate a significant results because of the p = 0.041 and also the variable of the drugs consumed also indicate a significant results of the p = 0.027. The results of the study reveal a significant correlation between psychotic disorders of paranoid schizophrenia to partial loss of teeth in patients at the Banda Aceh Mental Hospital with a significant duration of treatment and type of drugs consumed by the patient, but there is no significant correlation to gender.\r Keywords: Paranoid Schizophrenia, Antidepressant Drugs, Antipsychotic Drugs, Xerostomia, Dental Caries, Partial Tooth Loss.",

      "abstract": "Psychosis is understood as the brightest manifestations of mental illness, in which the patient's mental activity does not correspond to the surrounding reality, the reflection of the real world in consciousness is sharply distorted, which manifests itself in behavioral disorders, abnormal pathological symptoms and syndromes. Psychosis is a combination of biological (genetic, neuroanatomical, neurophysiological), psychological and social factors in various proportions. Psychoses are classified according to their origin (etiology) and reasons (pathogenetic mechanisms of development) into endogenous (including endogenous psychoses include schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, some psychotic forms of affective disorders), organic, somatogenic, psychogenic (reactive, situational), intoxication, withdrawal and post-withdrawal. Most often, psychoses develop in the framework of so-called endogenous disorder. The concepts of psychosis and schizophrenia are often equated, which is incorrect as psychotic disorders can occur in a number of mental illnesses: Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia, chronic alcoholism, drug addiction, epilepsy, intellectual disabilities, etc. Other types of psychosis, such as infectious, somatic and intoxication psychoses are quite often find among patients in non-psychiatric practices. This review article is a good educational material for medical and psychological practitioners whose goal is to improve knowledge and diagnostic processes of psychosis and its related disorders.",

Neuroimaging characteristics: T2 hyperintense lesions with little to no enhancement, edema, or hemorrhageh. Prognosis 1) Survival is variable (at least 3-5 years is expected) 2) Most low-grade astrocytomas undergo malignanttransformation with time 3) Risk factors for malignant transformation: tumorsize, gemistocytic pathology, presentation in first decade or after age 50 years, increased enhancement2. Anaplastic (WHO grade III) astrocytoma a. Associated with mutations of the tumor suppressor genep53 on chromosome 17p13.1 (as with the low-grade astrocytomas), mutation of the retinoblastoma (RB) tumor suppressor gene on chromosome 13q14 in 1/3 of cases, and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of chromosome 19q (the latter two are involved in transformation from a low-grade to an anaplastic astrocytoma)b. Presentation is often between 40 and 60 years of age (younger patients have longer survival)c. Mascroscopic features 1) Diffusely infiltrating heterogeneous neoplasm 2) Tumor may appear cystic and/or contain hemorrhagicfoci d. Microscopic features1) Cellular proliferation is more prominent than in lowgrade astrocytomas2) Often, frequent mitotic figures and endovascular proliferation3) No necrosis e. Seeding of the neuroaxis by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)dissemination and ependymal spread may occur but are rareoverexpression of proto-oncogene encoding plateletderived growth factor (PDGF)b. Occur typically in either first decade or between third and fourth decadesc. Usually hemispheric location, with predilection for temporal and posterior frontal lobes more than anterior parietal lobed. Tends to be infiltrative, with no well-defined borders e. Seizure is common presentation f. Pathology1) Pattern (from most common to least common): often fibrillary, protoplasmic, gemistocytic astrocytomas2) Fibrillary astrocytomas (Fig. 16-1) a) Well-differentiated astrocytes with scant cyto-plasm; atypical and hyperchromatic nuclei; fine, fibrillary processesb) Microcysts containing mucinous material c) Scant to absent mitotic figures and vascularproliferation d) Calcification is rare but may occur in up to 10% to20% of cases 3) Protoplasmic astrocytomasa) Hypocellular b) Cells with small round nuclei, sparse cytoplasm c) Prominent characteristic microcystic spaces4) Gemistocytic astrocytomas (Fig. 16-2) a) Large cells with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasmand eccentrically placed nuclei b) Usually worse prognosis c) Malignant transformation: more often than otherpathologic subtypesTable 16-1. WHO Classification and St. Anne/Mayo Grading of Astrocytic TumorsWHO St. Anne/Mayo_______________________________ ________________________________________________________ Designation Classification Grade (based on criteria)* Criteria*f. Median survival: usual estimate, about 2 to 3 years after presentation3. Glioblastoma multiforme a. Most common primary brain tumor, 50% of all gliomas b. Presentation: typically after age 50 c. With the aggressive nature and rapid progression,presenting symptoms include increased intracranial pressure, seizures, and focal neurologic symptomsd. Genetics 1) Secondary glioblastomas (malignant transformationof lower grade glioma to glioblastoma) can be associated with mutation of gene encoding PDGF-α, loss of tumor suppressor gene PTEN (LOH at chromosome 10q)2) Primary (de novo) glioblastomas a) Have no apparent antecedent low-or intermediate-grade tumor history b) Are often associated with amplification of theproto-oncogenes epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and MDM2, loss of tumor suppressorgene PTEN, LOH at chromosome 10, and mutation involving the RB genee. Most common locations: deep white matter and deep gray matter, including thalamus and basal gangliaf. Macroscopic and neuroimaging features 1) Heterogeneous-appearing mass with foci of necrosis,hemorrhage, and peritumoral edema (Fig. 16-3) 2) Neuroimaging often confirms the heterogeneousappearance, with central area of necrosis and a ringenhancing rim3) Despite the circumscribed gross appearance, thetumor is highly infiltrative and may also spread to opposite hemisphere through the corpus callosum (“butterfly gliomas”)4) Glioblastoma multiforme tumors may arise from malignant transformation of separate regions of the tumor and appear multifocal5) Contrast enhancement and vasogenic edema occur from disrupted blood-brain barrier (BBB)6) Treatment with corticosteroids assists in reestablishment of BBB and can yield almost immediate improvement of symptomsg. Microscopic features 1) All the features of anaplastic astrocytomas in additionto prominent endothelial proliferation and/or necrosis, surrounded by pseudopalisading of cells (Fig. 16-4)2) Neovascularization and endothelial hyperplasia may be due to production of angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)h. Natural history and spread 1) Typical: spread of tumor along white matter tractsand around the ependyma 2) Atypical: CSF dissemination through neuroaxis(occurs in 10%-20% of cases), may include pachymeningeal spread3) Almost never occur: invasion of dura mater and metastasis outside of CNS4) Meningeal invasion is sometimes called “meningeal gliomatosis,” occurs more frequently with malignant gliomasi. Treatment 1) Usually includes surgical debulking aimed at relievingmass effect and increasing effectiveness of adjunctive therapy (also sometimes to obtain pathology specimen)2) Complete resection is not possible because tumor is diffusely infiltrative and multifocal3) Stereotactic biopsy: reserved for deep and inaccessibletumors and comorbidities precluding general anesthesia 4) Most effective adjunctive therapy: external beamradiotherapy administered to limited field, up to 60 Gy given in conjunction with temozolomide chemotherapy-median survival, about 14 months; 2-year survival, about 27%4. Gliomatosis cerebri (Fig. 16-5) a. Diffuse, infiltrative glial tumor (usually astrocytoma)causing diffuse expansion of a portion of or entire cerebral hemisphere; may spread to one or both cerebral hemispheresb. Microscopic features (Fig. 16-6) 1) Resembles low-grade glioma 2) Mild increase in cellularity and pleomorphism 3) Rare mitotic figures 4) No hemorrhage or necrosis 5) Neoplastic glial cells cluster around neuronsc. Treatment 1) Some benefit from chemotherapy (as with PCV ortemozolamide) 2) No role for surgery because of infiltrative nature oftumorg. Brainstem gliomas: likely to be solid, diffuse fibrillary astrocytomas (rarely pilocytic tumor arising from fourth ventricle with “dorsally exophytic” growth, which may portend better prognosis)h. Macroscopic features: unencapsulated, but well-circumscribed (there may be limited degrees of infiltration) heterogeneous mass; may have a mural nodule associated with a cysti. Microscopic features 1) Compact pilocytic arrangements of elongated (some-times stellate) cells admixed with microcystic areas 2) Classic feature: abundant Rosenthal fibers, may beslight nuclear pleomorphism and rare mitoses j. 5-Year postoperative survival: 85% to 100% (95%-100% for cerebellar pilocytic astrocytomas) k. Cerbellar pilocytic astrocytomas have the best prognosisof all primary brain tumors l. Treatment1) Maximal surgical excision of tumor 2) Surgical excision of the mural nodule may be3) Marginal benefit from radiotherapy d. 2-Year survival after treatment, 5% to 10%E. Circumscribed Astrocytomas 1. Pilocytic astrocytomas (WHO grade I)a. Usually occur in first or second decade of life b. Better prognosis than diffuse astrocytomas c. Common locations: cerebellum (hemispheres &gt; vermis),optic chiasm, hypothalamus, and periventricular area of third and fourth ventricles (Fig. 16-7 A)d. Less common locations: spinal cord (Fig. 16-7 B and C), brainstem, cerebral hemispheres (temporal lobe is most common hemisphere site); tend to occur in older age group (young adults)e. Cerebellar hemisphere tumors: often large cystic, fluidfilled masses appearing hyperintense on T2-weighted images, with strongly (but somewhat heterogeneously) contrast-enhancing mural nodulef. Optic and hypothalamic gliomas: tend to be solid, pilocytic tumorsadequate and cystic wall need not be removed 3) With increasing thickness or enhancement of nodulewall, the cystic wall also needs to be removed 4) Nonresectable tumors or recurrence with malignanttransformation may require adjuvant radiotherapy 2. Pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas (WHO grade II orIII) a. Occur in second or third decade of life (average age atdiagnosis, 26 years) b. Often a history of seizures c. May originate from subpial astrocytes d. Macroscopic features1) Well-encapsulated tumor frequently containing a mural nodule within a cyst2) Often located superficially in temporal lobe e. Microsocopic features1) Large cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm, some containing lipid droplets2) Nuclear pleomorphism 3) Rare mitosesf. Neuroimaging: well-circumscribed cystic lesions appearing isointense or hypointense to brain parenchyma on T1-weighted and hyperintense on T2-weighted images,often with intense contrast enhancement of nodule g. Treatment1) Often includes complete resection 2) Radiation and chemotherapy often reserved forrecurrent or malignant tumors h. Postresection survival rates: 81% at 5 years, 70% at10 years; relatively benign prognosis 3. Subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (WHO grade I)a. Very slow-growing tumors, always associated with tuberous sclerosis (found in up to 14% of patients with tuberous sclerosis)b. Presentation: usually in first or second decade of life c. Usually originate near foramen of Monro, blocking CSFoutflow and causing hydrocephalus d. Macroscopic features: well-circumscribed, lobulated redmass (vascular tumor), often calcified and cysticLarge cells with cytoplasmic eosinophilic granular bodies are a characteristic feature of pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma, which is a low-grade gliomae. Microscopic features 1) Large, oval cells with abundant eosinophilic cyto-plasm and large, eccentric nucleus; often surround blood vessels in this vascular tumor2) Pleomorphism is often present 3) Mitoses and necrosis are unusualf. Neuroimaging: isointense or hyperintense on T2weighted images; intense, heterogeneous enhancement on T1-weighted imaging with contrastg. Definitive treatment for symptomatic patients (i.e., hydrocephalus) or extensive tumors: surgical resectionh. Unless symptomatic, patients are only followed with periodic neuroimagingF. Special Considerations 1. Optic gliomas (Fig. 16-8)a. 3% to 5% of all childhood brain tumors b. 2% of gliomas in adults c. Female predominance (female:male = 2:1) d. More common in children: 50% of patients presentbefore age 5, 90% before age 20 e. Tumors involving optic nerve alone have a betterprognosis than those involving optic chiasm (which have better prognosis than hypothalamic gliomas, although aggressive tumors involving optic chiasm may spread to involve hypothalamus)f. Associated with NF1 1) Occur in 1% to 7% of children with NF1 2) As many as 50% of patients with optic gliomas haveNF1 3) Almost all patients with bilateral optic nerve tumorssparing optic chiasm have NF1 g. Slow-growing tumors; malignant histologic features oraggressive behavior are rare (reported in cases of optic chiasm and hypothalamic gliomas)h. Usually pilocytic astrocytomas causing either diffuse expansion without subarachnoid involvement or primary subarachnoid spread with minimal involvement of optic nervei. Symptoms unique to optic nerve gliomas 1) Visual loss, visual field defects, painless proptosis, andsymptoms related to increased intracranial pressure 2) Symptoms of hypothalamic involvementa) Endocrinopathies: precocious puberty, diabetes insipidus, other related endocrinopathiesb) Gelastic seizures: characterized by involuntarylaughter, more common with hypothalamic hamartomasc) “Diencephalic syndrome”: emaciation, cachexia and loss of subcutaneous fat, emesis, pallor, hyperactivity, inappropriate behavior, euphoriaj. Treatment 1) Considered for tumors with aggressive behavior, espe-cially for patients presenting with visual deterioration 2) Radiotherapy considered for patients older than 5years presenting with tumors in locations other than intraorbital (intracranial locations such as chiasmal or retrochiasmal) and when total resection is not possible3) Chemotherapy considered for patients younger than 5 years4) Surgical excision may be limited to biopsy, especially for tumors involving optic chiasm2. Brainstem gliomas a. Account for 10% to 15% of brain tumors in children(&lt;5% of gliomas in adults) b. Age at diagnosis: often between 5 and 10 years c. Heterogeneous group of neoplasms: all grades of pathol-ogy observed, but most are malignant, with poor prognosisd. Symptoms: usually related to ataxia and other cerebellarfeatures, long tract signs, or cranial nerve deficits e. Neuroimaging (can predict prognosis better than patho-logic features) 1) Lesions appear as a high T2 signal with variabledegrees of enhancement 2) May contain a cystic component (Fig. 16-9) 3) Diffuse pontine gliomas: all are malignant 4) Most gliomas involving cervicomedullary junction arelow-grade gliomas 5) Tumors of midbrain usually have a better prognosisthan those involving medulla or pons 6) Dorsal exophytic tumors tend to have betterprognosis f. Prognosis1) Best for focal lesions, dorsal exophytic tumors, low histologic grade, longer period from onset of symptoms to diagnosis, adult age group, and in context of neurofibromatosis2) 5-Year survival: 5% to 30% g. Treatment1) Best: radiotherapy 2) Surgical resection usually involves stereotactic biopsy;is best performed on focal, cystic, or exophytic tumorsG. Rare Astrocytic Variants 1. Gliosarcomas: high-grade gliomas admixed with sarco-ma (variant of glioblastoma multiforme, with same prognosis)2. Gliofibroma a. Glioma admixed with population of cells resemblingfibroblasts b. Usually present in the first decadeH. Oligodendroglioma 1. From cells of oligodendroglial origin (O2A progenitorcells)2. Genetics a. Development of low-grade oligodendrogliomas: associ-ated with loss of heterozygosity of chromosomes 1p, 19q, and 4qb. Development of high-grade oligodendrogliomas from the low-grade tumors: associated with loss of heterozygosity of chromosomes 9p and 10qc. Both are associated with overexpression of EGFR 3. Account for 5% of all primary brain tumors and 30%of all intracranial gliomas 4. May be a male predominance (male:female = 3:2) 5. More often presents in adults: usually present betweenthird and fifth decades 6. Small earlier peak in childhood between 6 and 12 years;thalamic location at presentation is common in children7. Seizures are often the initial presentation in up to 75% of patients because tumor commonly involves cerebral cortex8. Most common location: frontal lobe, followed by temporal and parietal lobes; rarely brainstem or spinal cord9. Slow-growing, infiltrative gliomas: may start in subcortical white matter, tend to spread along white matter tracts and corpus callosum10. Better prognosis than astrocytomas 11. 5-Year survival rate, 75% 12. Mean postoperative survival, 4 to 11 years13. Macroscopic features: well-circumscribed, unencapsulated mass with cystic degeneration and calcification (necrosis and hemorrhage are rare)14. Microscopic features (Fig. 16-10) a. Variable b. Homogeneously appearing cells with sparse cytoplasmand round, uniform nuclei c. Cells may appear elongated, with a displaced nucleus;because of fixation artifact, there may be artifactual clearing of the cytoplasm, resembling fried eggsd. There may be mucin-rich microcystic spaces e. Capillaries interposed between uniform-appearing cellsmay form a delicate vascular “chicken-wire” pattern f. Pleomorphism and endothelial hyperplasia (less commonly,necrosis) indicate high-grade oligodendroglioma 15. Neuroimaging: heterogeneous appearing T2hyperintense mass often involving cerebral cortex with variable, heterogeneous enhancement pattern, cystic component, and calcification (in up to 90% of cases)16. Classified into high-grade and low-grade tumors 17. Features associated with high-grade tumors and lessfavorable prognosis a. Contrast enhancement b. Endothelial proliferation c. Mitotic figures d. More than 5% of MIB-1 staining e. Astrocytic component (with oligoastrocytomas, asdiscussed below) 18. Treatmenta. Gross total resection when possible (because tumor is infiltrative, microscopic infiltrates always remain)b. Primary adjuvant therapy: chemotherapy with alkylating agent such as temozolomide (before development of temozolomide, procarbazine/lomustine/vincristine [PVC] were used)c. Loss of heterozygosity of chromosome 1p or combined loss of heterozygosity of chromosomes 1p and 19q (50%- 80% of cases) portend better prognosis, prolonged survival, and better response to chemotherapyd. Although intermediate-grade oligodendrogliomas are often chemotherapy-responsive (e.g., 1p/19q deleted tumors), radiation (often in combination with chemotherapy) is still the mainstay of treatment to achieve maximal survival advantageI. Oligoastrocytoma 1. Composed of different populations of cells, someresembling astrocytes, some oligodendrocytes, and some indeterminate2. A common progenitor cell that differentiates into two different cell lines is likely3. Glial tumors with predominant oligodendrocytic population of cells are often interpreted as oligodendrocytes4. Increasing proportion of oligodendroglial component generally portends better prognosis (chromosome 1p and 19q deletions signify greater sensitivity of tumor to chemotherapy)J. Ependymoma 1. Epidemiologya. 5% to 8% of all primary intracranial tumors b. Age at presentation often in the first decade, with asecond peak in the fourth decade (prognosis worse for patients younger than 3 years)c. Third most common brain tumor in children d. Location (pediatric population): intracranial (90%) orspinal cord (10%) e. 2/3 of intracranial ependymomas occuring in childrenare infratentorial and about 1/3 supratentorial f. 2/3 of intracranial ependymomas occur in children (mostlyinfratentorial), and more than 90% of spinal cord ependymomas occur in adults (mostly myxopapillary ependymomas)2. Symptoms at presentation (depend largely on tumor location) a. Intracranial tumors often occur on floor (more frequentthan roof or lateral recesses) of fourth ventricle (medul-loblastomas tend to arise most frequently from roof of fourth ventricle)b. May present with obstructive hydrocephalus and associated symptoms of headache, nausea, vomiting, ataxia, vertigo, nystagmus3. Potential for CSF dissemination: because of close contact with CSF, there may be “drop metastasis” in 5% of cases4. Myxopapillary ependymomas a. Well-encapsulated, indolent, slow-growing vasculartumors arising from filum terminale b. Occur most often in adults c. Associated with good prognosis5. Posterior fossa ependymomas a. Well-demarcated tumors that tend to fill fourth ventricleand extend through foramen magnum b. Appear as T2 hyperintense masses with heterogeneoussignal that may represent tumor vascularity (or necrosis) c. Often a heterogeneous pattern of enhancement6. Microscopic features (Fig. 16-11) a. Sheets of uniform cells with round nuclei and variablecytoplasm among perivascular anuclear fibrillary processes: “pseudorosettes” (fine cellular fibrillary processes that radiate toward blood vessel)b. Myxopapillary ependymomas are characterized by sheets of uniform columnar or cuboidal cells admixed with pools of mucin often bordered by tumor cells and containing a central blood vesselc. Cytologic pleomorphism, necrosis, mitotic figures, and giant cells often signify anaplastic ependymomas7. Treatment: surgical resection and/or adjuvant radiotherapy (optimal outcome with doses between 5,000 cGy and 5,500 cGy) a. Higher survival with gross total resection: goal is toobtain maximal possible resection b. For low-grade ependymomas of spine parenchyma orfilum terminale (myxopapillary ependymoma): surgical resection is mainstay of treatment, radiation is considered if residual tumor is present postoperativelyc. Extensive craniospinal radiation to entire neuroaxis required for patients presenting with CSF disseminationd. Response to chemotherapy is suboptimal; this treatment modality is considered for patients with contraindications to radiation (e.g., children younger than 3 years or patients with recurrent disease )8. Prognosis: generally favorable, especially adults with myxopapillary ependymomas (except for 10%-20% of cases that have CSF dissemination)9.

      "title": "STXBP1 Encephalopathy with Epilepsy",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics STXBP1 encephalopathy with epilepsy is characterized by early-onset encephalopathy with epilepsy (i.e., moderate-to-severe intellectual disability, refractory seizures, and ongoing epileptiform activity). The median age of onset of seizures is six weeks (range 1 day to 13 years). Seizure types can include infantile spasms; generalized tonic-clonic, clonic, or tonic seizures; and myoclonic, focal, atonic, and absence seizures. Epilepsy syndromes can include Ohtahara syndrome, West syndrome, Lennox-Gaustaut syndrome, and Dravet syndrome (not SCN1A-related), classic Rett syndrome (not MECP2-related), and atypical Rett syndrome (not CDKL5-related). The EEG is characterized by focal epileptic activity, burst suppression, hypsarrhythmia, or generalized spike-and-slow waves. Other findings can include abnormal tone, movement disorders (especially ataxia and dystonia), and behavior disorders (including autism spectrum disorder). Feeding difficulties are common. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis is established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous intragenic pathogenic variant in STXBP1 or a contiguous gene deletion that includes STXBP1 and adjacent genes on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Developmental delay, cognitive dysfunction, and intellectual disability are managed in the usual manner. The most commonly used anti-seizure medications (ASMs) are phenobarbital, valproic acid, and vigabatrin; an estimated 20% of individuals require more than one ASM and approximately 25% are refractory to ASM therapy. Severe dystonia, dyskinesia, and choreoathetosis can be treated with monoamine depleters or dopaminergic agents. Behavior disorders and feeding difficulties are managed symptomatically in the usual manner. Surveillance: Neuropsychological assessment and EEG are performed as needed. Genetic counseling STXBP1 encephalopathy with epilepsy is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. To date, most probands represent simplex cases (i.e., a single occurrence in a family) and have the disorder as a result of a de novo STXBP1 pathogenic variant. Individuals with STXBP1 encephalopathy with epilepsy are not known to reproduce. Once the STXBP1 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

      "abstract": "Normal conscious behaviour means awareness of self and the environment and depends on intact brain function.'Changes in the level of consciousness reflect an abnormal function of the brain.The degree, depth, and duration of altered consciousness may vary from drowsiness to brain death, and \"coma\" or un- consciousness is best defined as an inability to obey commands, utter recognisable words, or open the eyes.2Pathological conditions associated with this state are brain injury from trauma; cerebrovascular accidents; hypoxia; hypotension (low perfusion states); uncontrolled epilepsy; and disorders of metabolism, such as hepatic and renal failure and drug overdose.As well as managing the primary cause of the coma, energetic treatment is needed to prevent the complications of unconscious- ness, the most serious of which are hypoxia and hypotension.All unconscious patients run the risk of an obstructed airway from the tongue falling back into the oropharynx.The inability to cough or swallow leads to an accumulation of secretions in the mouth, pharynx, trachea, and bronchi.Vomit and regurgitated gastric contents may be inhaled giving rise to the acid-aspiration (Mendelson's) syndrome in the lungs.The already damaged brain cannot withstand any further insults that may occur from inadequate cerebral oxygenation and perfusion due to a low arterial Po2 or low blood pressure.3The unconscious patient may need total care for days, weeks, or months, the problems being those of maintaining vital functions (adequate ventilation, circulation, and nutrition) and general nursing care.Anaesthesia is a pharmacologically induced state of uncon- sciousness and the well-trained anaesthetists of today, with their skill in care of the airway, endotracheal intubation, intravenous cannulation, ventilator management, and knowledge of applied pharmacology and respiratory physiology, are particularly able to care for these patients.The skills and lessons learnt in the operating theatre have enabled them to take part in the development, organisation, and management of patients in immediate care schemes and intensive treatment units and to teach these skills to other doctors, nurses, paramedical staff, and ambulance men.",

According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM IV) (1), a delusion is a false belief based on incorrect inference about external reality that is firmly sustained despite what almost everyone else believes. Hallucination is a sensory perception that has the compelling sense of reality of a true perception, but that occurs without external stimulation of the relevant sensory organ. The person may or may not have insight in that he or she is having a hallucination. Psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions are the cardinal features of psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, schizo-affective disorder, delusional disorder, and brief psychotic disorder. Psychotic symptoms may also occur during the course of delirium or dementias and may be due to a range of other general medical and neurological conditions, including PD.",

      "title": "KNOWING DEPRESSION AND PHARMACOLOGICAL, NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL APPROACHES FOR ITS TREATMENT",
      "abstract": "Summary Since 1990, significant efforts have been made towards developing interventions to prevent depression. Depression is a serious medical illness that involves brain. Persons of any age-children or adults may develop depression symptoms. Symptoms such as intense sadness, loss of interest or pleasure in normal activities, sleep disturbances or oversleeping, change in appetite and deceased energy level; feeling of helplessness and thoughts of suicide are sequels to stress induced depression. The primary clinical manifestations of major depression are significant depression of mood and impairment of function. Mood and anxiety disorders are the most common mental illnesses. Clinical depression must be distinguished from normal grief, sadness, disappointment and the dysphoria or demoralization often associated with medical illness. Physical changes also occur, particularly in severe, vital, or melancholic depression. These include insomnia or hypersomnia; altered eating patterns, with anorexia and weight loss or sometimes overeating; decreased energy and libido; and disruption of the normal circadian and ultradian rhythms of activity, body temperature and many endocrine functions. Depressed patients usually respond to antidepressant drugs, or, in severe or treatment-resistant cases, to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This review focuses on knowledge of depression, pharmacological and non-pharmacological measures for its treatment and future directions for the field of depression prevention.",

      "title": "Consanguinity and Mental Disorder",
      "abstract": "One difficulty which hinders the advance of psychiatry is that the facts of a mental disorder are not easy to describe and to record accurately. Many of the descriptive words used, such as “depression”, “confusion”, are taken from common speech and carry with them vague meanings. Out of sympathy with the sufferer, we tend to read our own emotions into the clinical picture. Moreover, because a disorder of thought and behaviour is a disorder of adaptation to living, the description of a mental disease involves not only the recording of the symptoms, but also a description of the circumstances and life-setting in which they occur. Another difficulty lies in the great variation in the clinical pictures of mental disorder. These vary so much that a diagnostic label such as affective psychosis or schizophrenia does not convey, and indeed is not intended to convey, an idea of a specific disease. These difficulties are somewhat more marked in the investigation of mental disorder in contrast to the investigation of mental defect. The statement that a patient is a Mongol or a cerebral diplegic conveys the idea of a fairly definite clinical syndrome, whereas a statement that a person suffers from schizophrenia calls up a much less clear mental picture. It seems that the only way out of this difficulty is to give a short statement of the clinical facts about each psychotic whom one discusses.",

      "abstract": "Abstract A common denominator in psychosomatically induced death is stress. Death can occur slowly, as from the preponderance of chronic stressors, or it can come on suddenly, as from an acute stressor. Sudden death is more likely in an individual with a preexistent serious medical condition such as hypertension, CAD, diabetes mellitus, hyperthyroidism, peptic ulcer, Cushing's disease, and bronchial asthma. Individuals are more prone to sudden death who are: (1) highly anxious; (2) hostile; (3) manipulative of the environment; (4) anger repressors; (5) rapid shifters between anxiety and depression; (6) sufferers of a recent major less; or (7) socially isolated. Most cases of sudden death are related to the presence of a severely stressful situation in which there appears to be no means of control or escape. With mind control, hypnosis, and voodoo curses, circumstances can be manipulated to achieve severe stress and uncontrollability.",

      "abstract": "Taxonomy and nomenclature of normal and abnormal states of consciousness have been highly variable, imprecise and sometimes confusing, because the terms used to describe them have been given different meanings depending on medical field (e.g.neurology and psychiatry) and language.Compounding the difficulty is the fact that the terms continue to be changed in an attempt to reflect pathophysiology of disturbed consciousness which, however, is still not fully understood.In this article the terminological development and various definitions of the terms sopor, stupor, delirium, akinetic mutism and coma vigile,\"apallisches Syndrom\" (\"apallic syndrome\") or vegetative state are being described with special emphasis on the German and English medical usage and some discrepant denotations.Acute confusional state (\"akuter Verwirrtheitszustand\") e.g. has been classified either as a symptom orinauspiciously -also as syndrome/disease thereby making it synonymous to delirium.The English usage of the term \"stupor\" in neurology instead of \"sopor\" (semi-comatose state) stands in contrast to the psychiatric usage, where stupor implies absence of voluntary movement and responsiveness to external stimuli while being fully awake (e.g.dissociative stupor).German designations such as Bonhoeffer's \"akuter exogener Reaktionstyp\" (\"acute exogenous reaction type\") as umbrella term for symptomatic psychoses, Wieck's \"Durchgangssyndrome\" (\"transitional syndromes\") for acute reversible organic psychic disorders with unaltered consciousness or \"Dämmerzustand\" (twilight state) are being discussed and related to the term \"delirium\" with its various definitions in recent years.",

      "title": "Third Generation Antipsychotic Drugs: Partial Agonism or Receptor Functional Selectivity?",
      "abstract": "Functional selectivity is the term that describes drugs that cause markedly different signaling through a single receptor (e.g., full agonist at one pathway and antagonist at a second). It has been widely recognized recently that this phenomenon impacts the understanding of mechanism of action of some drugs, and has relevance to drug discovery. One of the clinical areas where this mechanism has particular importance is in the treatment of schizophrenia. Antipsychotic drugs have been grouped according to both pattern of clinical action and mechanism of action. The original antipsychotic drugs such as chlorpromazine and haloperidol have been called typical or first generation. They cause both antipsychotic actions and many side effects (extrapyramidal and endocrine) that are ascribed to their high affinity dopamine D(2) receptor antagonism. Drugs such as clozapine, olanzapine, risperidone and others were then developed that avoided the neurological side effects (atypical or second generation antipsychotics). These compounds are divided mechanistically into those that are high affinity D(2) and 5-HT(2A) antagonists, and those that also bind with modest affinity to D(2), 5-HT(2A), and many other neuroreceptors. There is one approved third generation drug, aripiprazole, whose actions have been ascribed alternately to either D(2) partial agonism or D(2) functional selectivity. Although partial agonism has been the more widely accepted mechanism, the available data are inconsistent with this mechanism. Conversely, the D(2) functional selectivity hypothesis can accommodate all current data for aripiprazole, and also impacts on discovery compounds that are not pure D(2) antagonists.",

      "abstract": "The disorders under consideration are the result of identifiable conditions. Historically, an arbitrary distinction has been made between \"organic\" conditions, associated with a presumably clear pathological basis, and \"functional\" conditions, or psychiatric disorders that lacked obvious disease processes. Delirium, however, is a disorder of cognitive dysfunction that lacks a well-understood pathophysiology despite unequivocal association with multiple and various medical conditions. More generally, delirium and dementia are frequently complicated by psychopathology (for example, delusions or changes in mood) traditionally associated with so-called functional disorders (schizophrenia and affective disorders, respectively). The organic/functional distinction obscured the propensity of medical conditions (e.g., thyroid dysfunction) to present with psychiatric symptoms that resolved after effective treatment of the nonpsychiatric condition. The nosological conventions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) (1) allow recognition of syndromes of disseminated cognitive dysfunction, such as delirium and dementia, as well as the psychopathology that is the product of various and multiple medical conditions without obscuring the need to consider these entities in the differential diagnosis of \"functional\" symptomatology. Regardless of the evolution of diagnostic convention, the illnesses described in this chapter can present to the psychiatrist as a \"mental\" condition or present to other medical specialists as \"medical\" conditions.",

      "title": "Syncope: an overview of diagnosis and treatment",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Syncope is a syndrome in which a relatively sudden-onset, brief loss of consciousness results from a temporary self-terminating period of total cerebral hypoperfusion (1-4). In this regard, it is important to note that other conditions (e.g., epilepsy, concussions, metabolic disturbances and intoxications) may also cause a temporary loss of consciousness (TLOC) but nonetheless are not ‘syncope’ (3-5). Each of these differ from syncope either by the need for medical intervention to reverse the process (e.g., hypoglycemia) or by the underlying mechanism of the loss of consciousness (e.g., electrical disturbance in epilepsy, trauma in head injury, etc.) or both. Other conditionsmayalsomimic syncope. These are often termed ‘syncope mimics’ or ‘pseudosyncope’, but differ from syncope inasmuch as they do not cause true loss of consciousness (e.g., conversion reactions, malingering, and cataplexy). In itself, ‘syncope’ is not a complete diagnosis. Identifying the cause is important, since syncopemay be amarker of increasedmortality risk in some cases, but even more often may lead to physical injury resulting from falls or accidents, diminished quality-of-life, and possible restriction from employment or avocation. The goal should be to determine the cause of syncope with sufficient confidence to provide a reasonable assessment of prognosis, recurrence risk, and treatment options. The initial step is always the documentation of a comprehensive and detailed medical history (3-7). LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS Consciousness and ‘loss of consciousness’ (LOC) are complex concepts, but most physicians have a working understanding of what ismeant (8). Essentially, LOC implies not only loss of awareness and appropriate responsiveness to external stimuli, but also loss of postural tone. Occasionally, however, symptoms may suggest that ‘syncope’ is imminent, but the full clinical picture does not evolve at that time; such cases are often termed ‘near-syncope’. In such instances, the patient may experience near loss of vision (‘grey-out’ due principally to transient loss of blood supply to the retina), diminution of hearing, and feeling ‘out-of-touch’ with their surroundings and/or confused. On the other hand, many times patients complain of less well defined symptoms such as “dizziness” or “lightheadedness”. These latter complaints (especially in the elderly)may be due to an illdefined functional cerebral dysfunction triggered by transient hypotension (perhaps not severe enough to cause TLOC), but in most cases it is believed that such symptoms are not related to either ‘syncope’ or ‘nearsyncope’, and shouldnot be reported as such.",

      "title": "Epileptic seizures and headache/migraine: A review of types of association and terminology",
      "abstract": "There are different possible temporal associations between epileptic seizures and headache attacks which have given rise to unclear or controversial terminologies. The classification of the International League Against Epilepsy does not refer to this type of disorder, while the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-2) defines three kinds of association: (1) migraine-triggered seizure (\"migralepsy\"), (2) hemicrania epileptica, and (3) post-ictal headache.We performed an extensive review of the literature, not including \"post-ictal\" and \"inter-ictal\" headaches.On the basis of well-documented reports, the following clinical entities may be identified: (A) \"epileptic headache (EH)\" or \"ictal epileptic headache (IEH)\": in this condition headache (with or without migrainous features) is an epileptic manifestation per se, with onset, and cessation if isolated, coinciding with the scalp or deep EEG pattern of an epileptic seizure. EH maybe followed by other epileptic manifestations (motor/sensory/autonomic); this condition should be differentiated from \"pure\" or \"isolated\" EH, in which headache/migraine is the sole epileptic manifestation (requiring differential diagnosis from other headache forms). \"Hemicrania epileptica\" (if confirmed) is a very rare variant of EH, characterized by ipsilateral location of headache and ictal EEG paroxysms. (B) \"Pre-ictal migraine\" and \"pre-ictal headache\": when a headache attack is followed during, or shortly after, by a typical epileptic seizure. The migraine attack may be with or without aura, and its seizure-triggering role (\"migraine-triggered seizure\") is still a subject of debate. A differentiation from occipital epilepsy is mandatory. The term \"migralepsy\" has not been used uniformly, and may therefore led to misinterpretation.On the basis of this review we suggest definitions and a terminology which may become the basis of a forthcoming classification of headaches associated with epileptic seizures.",

Sometimes somnolence is one of the manifestations of a pathological process, and in others it is the major and dominant symptom bringing the patient to the doctor. Our experience in the study of hypersomnia (we have observed 120 patients in recent years) demonstrates that physicians have inadequate familiarity with this problem. Sometimes somnolence is regarded not as the result of pathology, but as a manifestation of excessive fatigue. There is inadequate differentiation of the forms of hypersomnic disorders. One of the causes of these errors is the absence of a logical classification. The most thorough classification is that of A. Epshtein, (1) etiological in nature: 1) random sleep disorders; 2) secondary sleep disorders; 3) constitutional neuropathic; 4) reactive; 5) symptomatic; 6) essential disorders; and 7) sleep disorders associated with psychosis. It has become obsolete, and does not cover the clinical forms of hypersomnia. We have deemed it desirable to make a classification based on clinical principles, with due consideration for etiology.",

      "title": "[Hallucinogenic psilocybine containing mushrooms. Toxins contained in Danish wild mushrooms].",
      "abstract": "A number of the wild Danish mushrooms contain the hallucinogenic agent psilocybin which resembles LSD in many ways. The commonest of these are the \"liberty cap\" or \"magic mushrooms\" (Psilocybe semilanceata). On the basis of experience from USA and western Europa, increase in employment of this mushrooms as a hallucinogenic intoxicant may be anticipated in Denmark. The history, epidemiology, botany and pharmacology of the mushroom are reviewed. Clinical pictures and treatment are described for: 1) Acute poisoning with psilocybin-containing fungi, 2) Late sequelae of consumption of psilocybin-containing fungi and 3) Poisoning with more poisonous fungi on account of incorrect identification. General practitioners, duty roster doctors, doctors in casualty departments and in acute psychiatric departments should be aware of these problems. Intoxication with psilocybin may be confused with panic anxiety or euphoria in persons with mydriasis and other sympathomimetic symptoms. The possibility of more serious mushroom poisoning on account of incorrect identification should be borne in mind.",

Akinetic mutism is a condition characterized by a lack of spontaneous movements and little or no vocalization. Somnambulism include performing of complex motor activity in an automatic manner during deep sleep, without any awareness of its execution. The locked-in syndrome is a state with quadriplegia coexisting with cranial nerves palsies and mutism, but with fully preserved consciousness. Psychogenic coma is a condition in which the patient has preserved level of consciousness and awareness, but does not communicate with theenvironment and does not exhibit the external manifestations of consciousness.

      "abstract": "A common neurological condition known as epilepsy is characterized by recurrent bouts of uncontrollable body movements that affect only a portion of the body (partial) or the full body (generalized), occasionally accompanied by loss of consciousness and control over bowel or bladder function. Uncontrolled seizures are linked to medical and psychological illness, dependent behavior, a low quality of life, and a higher risk of untimely death. Epilepsy affects people of all ages, ethnicities, sexes, levels of education, socioeconomic status, and social classes worldwide. The prodrome phase is a pre-epileptic feeling or experience that might start hours, days, or even weeks in advance of the actual seizure. The most prevalent prodromal phase symptoms include difficulties maintaining focus, tension, exhaustion, sleep disruptions, behavioral changes (differently smelling, tasting, having ringing in the ears, feeling queasy, etc.), restlessness, and others. The ictal phase defined as spans the interval between the start of a seizure and its conclusion. The phrase \"interictal\" refers to a phase that occurs between seizures or headaches. \"Postictal\" refers to the period following a seizure. The duration of postictalphase varies from minutes to hours depending on the type of seizure, the frequency and intensity of seizures, and the length of the seizure.",

O trato nervoso simpático do olho é extenso, se dividindo em neurônio central, pré e pós ganglionar, ou neurônios de primeira, segunda e terceira ordem, como mencionado em literaturas mais antigas. A partir disto, a SH deve ser classificada quanto a neurolocalização da lesão, existem outras possibilidades não bem elucidadas, como no hipotiroidismo e a apresentação idiopática. O diagnóstico definitivo padrão ouro é realizado por meio da instilação de colírio à base cocaína 5 a 10%, entretanto devido ao difícil acesso, a solução de fenilefrina 1 a 10% pode ser uma substituta, em ambos os casos os animais positivos para SH continuaram com a miose e os demais sinais já apresentados. Por se tratar de uma enfermidade secundária a uma lesão no decorrer do trato nervoso, uma investigação sistemática, utilizando exames de imagem, se mostra necessário, uma vez que tratar a causa base é o início do tratamento. Este, como já mencionado, irá depender da localização da lesão, para tratamento sintomático é utilizada a fenilefrina 1 a 10%, na qual alivia os sinais parassimpáticos temporariamente. Desse modo, este trabalho tem o objetivo de realizar uma revisão de literatura acerca das particularidades da síndrome de Horner em cães e gatos.",

The syndrome occurs in a state of clear awareness and without any significant loss of the remaining intellectual abilities. Conditions associated with Amnestic Syndrome of either transient or persistent course include thiamine deficiency, head trauma, carbon monoxide poisoning, subarachnoid hemorrhage, herpes simplex encephalitis, brain tumor, bilateral posterior cerebral arterial occlusion, and cerebral hypoxia. Management approaches are similar to those described for demented patients. The most commonly implicated substances are alcohol and sedative-hypnotic drugs. Several other drugs have been reported to produce amnestic disorders, including bromides, isoniazid, and anticholinergic agents. Organic Hallucinosis is a syndrome characterized by recurrent or persistent hallucinations attributable to specific organic factors judged to be etiologically related to the disturbance. Alcoholic Hallucinosis consists of vivid auditory hallucinations developing shortly after cessation or reduction of heavy ingestion of alcohol in an individual who apparently has alcohol dependence.",

The concomitant intravenous and intramuscular administration of the specific narcotic antagonist naloxone is warranted in such cases. Further threatening complications of opiate abuse include rhabdomyolysis, noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, and both peripheral and central nervous lesions. Opiate abuse is often associated with benzodiazepine abuse. Hence, intravenous administration of the antagonist flumazenil is indicated in patients with suspected acute opiate intoxication resistant to naloxone. Cocaine abuse is not frequent in this country but is usually very severe and clinically heterogeneous. The clinical pattern of cocaine intoxication is initially due to excitatory and later to depressant effects on central nervous, circulatory and respiratory systems. The treatment of acute cocaine intoxication is symptomatic. The internal concealment of cocaine and other drugs in packets (body-packing) may lead to bowel obstruction or to acute intoxication following leaking or breaking of packets.",

Withdrawal symptomatology does not necessarily subside within a few weeks and may be associated with other manifestations of behavioral toxicity (loss of treatment efficacy, refractoriness, switch into mania/hypomania, or paradoxical reactions). The oppositional model of tolerance provides a pathophysiologic basis for understanding and managing withdrawal syndromes. Reintroducing the antidepressant that was initially used or switching from one antidepressant to another to suppress symptomatology, as suggested by current guidelines, may actually aggravate the state of behavioral toxicity and be detrimental in the long run. Alternative strategies that do not encompass continuation of antidepressant treatment are required, but there is currently lack of adequate research for guiding the clinical approach. Some tentative suggestions are provided.",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy is characterized by nonspecific neurologic findings, mild visual impairment from chorioretinopathy or optic atrophy, male infertility, and characteristic findings on brain MRI. Neurologic findings include mild ataxia (action tremor and gait instability following initially normal motor development; occasionally, mild spasticity), cognitive impairment in some (typically mild, rarely severe), psychiatric symptoms in some (depression and schizophrenia-like symptoms), headaches in some (usually intermittent, severe, and diffuse) and auditory symptoms in some (hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo). Affected individuals remain ambulatory, do not require support for walking, and rarely become blind. To date CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy has been reported or identified in 31 individuals from 30 families. It is not yet known if the findings occurring in a few individuals (i.e., epilepsy and paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia) are part of the phenotypic spectrum or unrelated findings. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy is established in a proband by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in CLCN2 on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Supportive care including physical therapy and rehabilitation to improve motor function, special education as needed, treatment of headache, guidance for visual impairment. Surveillance: Annual: neurologic examination. Every 2-3 years: ophthalmologic examination and audiologic assessment. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of older and younger sibs of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from early diagnosis and routine surveillance for motor, cognitive, vision, and hearing impairment. Genetic counseling CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for a CLCN2 pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Once the CLCN2 pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk family members and prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing for CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy are possible.",

      "abstract": "Summary: Intellectual deterioration in epilepsy may be real or apparent. The latter refers to delay in cognitive development such that performance against age‐related norms appears to drop. The former, real deterioration can occur due to concomitant degenerative neurological disease of which epilepsy is also a symptom, or it may happen as a consequence of one or more of a number of other factors. These include (1) direct effects of seizures and abnormal electroencephalogram activity on brain function, (2) traumatic brain injury secondary to seizures, including status epilepticus, (3) the influence of antiepileptic therapy, both drugs and surgery, on cognitive function, (4) psychosocial sequelae of diagnosis. Some epilepsy syndromes include intellectual deterioration as a frequent feature, with various causes. Developmental factors may also play a part. Cognitive functioning may be impaired by the presence of an epileptogenic lesion, and also in different ways and at different times by other brain areas involved with partial seizures, including irritative and functional deficit zones. Abnormal activity in these areas at critical periods in development may interact and disrupt pathways necessary for maturation of frontal lobe and limbic system functioning, leading to long‐term neurological deficits. Increased understanding of the mechanisms by which this may happen raises intriguing possibilities for prevention and remediation.",

Insomnia presents as trouble falling asleep (long-sleep latency), trouble staying asleep (excessive or prolonged awakenings), or feeling nonrestored from sleep. Insomnia can be a primary disorder emerging in childhood or later, a conditioned (psychophysiological) disorder, or comorbid with a psychiatric, medical, or other sleep disorder. Insomnia can be transient (related to stress, illness, travel) or chronic (occurring nightly for 6 months). Persistent untreated insomnia is a strong risk factor for major depression. Insomnia must be distinguished from sleep-state misperception and short sleep states without symptoms. More than 50 epidemiological studies have shown that one third of various general populations have insomnia symptoms and that 9% to 21% have insomnia with serious daytime consequences, such as bodily fatigue, diminished energy, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, low motivation, loss of productivity, irritability, interpersonal difficulties (with family, friends, coworkers), increased worrying, anxiety, and depression. Chronic sleep loss, which occurs in untreated insomnia, is a major risk factor for fatigue-related automobile crashes and industrial accidents, loss of jobs, marital and social problems, poor health, metabolic and endocrine dysregulation with impaired ability to maintain weight control, coronary heart disease, major depression, and suicidality. Insomnia is associated with enormous direct and indirect costs, as much as $14 billion in the United States in 1995. Physicians should therefore establish an effective clinical strategy for eliciting and managing insomnia complaints. Use of a sleep-trained nurse, psychologist, or both on a consultation basis or as a member of the physician’s medical practice should be considered. One study has reported on the benefit of behavioral treatment of insomnia provided by a trained clinic nurse in a general medical practice. However, the cost-effectiveness of incorporating a sleep-trained nurse or psychologist into a medical practice has yet to be reported.",

When we wake up or go to sleep we have altered our state of consciousness. We can also alter our state of consciousness by taking drugs that lower our state of excitation or drugs that raise our state of excitation or drugs that are hallucinatory; or by exercising (endorphins), by falling in love or having sex, by meditating, by getting angry, by being in isolation or being inebriated, by fading out listening to a boring lecture or by getting enthusiastic about an exciting one. You can see that almost anything we do may involve changes in our state of consciousness.",

They wax and wane spontaneously over time and look like fragments of normal movements. Their frequency may increase in situations of stress or challenge and during emotional excitement. The symptomatology is attenuated during sleep and by goal-oriented behavior/concentration. Tics can be voluntarly suppressed for limited periods of time; the sensory-motor phenomena before a tic may be used as signal. Apart from simple movements and vocal impulses, more complex motor (e.g., slapping oneself, hopping, copropraxia = obscene gesturing, echopraxia = imitation of others) and linguistic discharges (such as coprolalia = use of obscene language, palilalia = repetition of the most recently spoken syllables or words and echolalia = repetition of words spoken by others) can also occur. The combination of chronic (lasting longer than a year) vocal and multiple motor tics is termed Tourette syndrome (TS). The indication and choices for pharmaco therapy (e.g., tiapride, risperidone, aripiprazole) within a broader therapeutic framework will be presented, including the pharmacological strategy with comorbid mental disorders like ADHD and OCD.",

      "title": "Pharmacological Treatment of Psychosis",
      "abstract": "Psychotic symptoms may be the primary characteristic of a specific disorder such as schizophrenia, occur secondary to a mood disorder such as major depression, or be due to a known causative factor such as a drug-induced paranoid reaction. Schizophrenia is the best studied disorder in terms of pharmacological treatment, and schizoaffective disorder is often included in these medication trials. Although antipsychotics have often been prescribed for major mood disorders with psychotic features, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has dramatically expanded their approved uses in recent years. Several of these agents are now indicated for bipolar and unipolar disorders, even in the absence of psychosis. Antipsychotics are also often prescribed off-label, but limited data are available to guide their appropriate use. For example, they are widely administered to older patients experiencing behavioral disturbances or psychosis associated with dementia. The potential risks of such off-label use are underscored by an FDA-mandated box warning for all antipsychotics, primarily due to an increased incidence of cardiovascular events and the related morbidity and mortality. Because individuals with schizophrenia may experience subtle changes in behavior and cognition for long periods prior to their first acute psychotic episode, early diagnosis and intervention are increasingly emphasized. Recognition of impending or subtle signs of psychosis and introduction of an antipsychotic to reduce duration of untreated symptoms may have a substantial impact on long-term outcome. For example, a recent meta-analysis found that limiting the duration of untreated psychosis to less than 9 months was associated with a substantially greater reduction in negative symptoms (Boonstra et al. 2012). Imaging studies indicate that during the early years after illness onset, a subset of patients with schizophrenia may demonstrate significant decreases in gray matter and white matter, as well as increases in cerebrospinal fluid (Andreasen et al. 2011). The use of antipsychotic drugs in this population, however, is complicated by conflicting reports of an association between exposure to them and either neuroprotective or neurotoxic effects (Lewis 2011). Although antipsychotic drug therapy is used for several FDA-approved and unapproved indications, the existing evidence base for these medications is strongest for their role in managing multiple-episode schizophrenia, which is the focus of this chapter. (For management of first-episode patients, see Chapter 8, \"Early-Stage Schizophrenia.\") In this chapter, data for both acute and long-term management are considered. Because inadequate response and treatment resistance are common in this population, strategies to augment standard antipsychotics or to serve as alternatives are also reviewed. Throughout the chapter, an emphasis is placed on the value of a risk-benefit assessment that takes into account the substantial safety and tolerability issues associated with this class of psychotropic medications.",

      "abstract": "Regarding the treatment of insomnia, it is said that a considerable degree of advancement has been made to date in terms of controlling toxicity, preventing the development of tolerance and avoiding addiction, which were often observed when administering barbiturates. Nevertheless, the majority of hypnotics used today, which are benzodiazepines, still retain certain side effects such as hangover effects, development of dependence, rebound insomnia as a withdrawal symptom, muscular atonia resulting in falling down and causing bone fracture, inhibition of respiratory system, negative interaction with alcohol, etc. The current trend of selecting hypnotics is to use short-half-life agents. However, there are yet other problems such as cognitive disorders including amnesia, rebound insomnia and increased anxiety during the daytime. In order to cope with these problems, three new hypnotics have recently been developed. They are non-benzodiazepine derivatives and considered to be safer than the others, because they are supposed to cause less side effects than conventional hypnotics. The pharmacokinetic characteristics of these new hypnotics can be summarized as follows: 1) these hypnotics have selective affinity to benzodiazepine receptor omega-1 subtype although the agent itself does not belong to the benzodiazepine derivative family; 2) the half-life-time in the serum is extremely short, namely 1-2 hours; 3) they increase the level of slow waves (delta-wave) during sleep; 4) they have a lesser effect toward atonic muscle and amnestic thought and behavioral disturbance as compared to conventional hypnotics; and 5) the risks of developing drug tolerance and reciprocal negative effects with alcohol are smaller. Consequently, we can expect that these new hypnotics will bring a certain advantage, especially regarding the avoidance of hypnotics-induced side effects in the course of clinical treatment of insomnia in the future.",

Where the illness is short-lived, the clinical syndrome is defined as a schizophrenia-related diagnosis [1]. The clinical presentation usually encompasses features prominent in other psychiatric conditions such as cognitive dysfunction, motor abnormalities, obsessional phenomena or depression. These additional features not included in the definition of schizophrenia underscore its pervasive neural dysfunction; they influence management and often shape the clinical outcome. The seeds of schizophrenia may be sown in early life with aberrant childhood development in multiple domains [2], but the clinical syndrome typically presents in early adulthood (Figure 9.10.1); abnormal neural connectivity may underly these seemingly remote phenomena.",

      "abstract": "Any one of a number of psychologic patterns may appear cardiotomy: (1) Some patients may be elated and confident after awakening from anesthesis and have no severe changes of affect or neurologic deficit. Denial seems to be for them an adequate defense against anxiety. (2) Others are disoriented and manifest neurologic disturbance immediately after awakening, without a lucid interval. The sensorium begins to clear five days after surgery. (3) Some patients go into delirium after being lucid for as long as a week and have hallucinations, illusions, and motor excitation for a few days-or over several weeks. Pathologic brain changes that are apparently anatomical correlates of neurologic deficits in delirium include anoxic lesions of the hippocampus, and infarcted foci. Physiologic factors that contribute to this reaction include: long periods of extracorporeal circulation, arterial hypotension during surgery, emboli, and low postoperative cardiac output. Age, and the type and severity of heart impairment are also factors. Psychologic factors to be taken into account include preexisting psychopathology and the failure of denial under the stress of physical symptoms or hospitalization. Delirium is fostered by sensory overload (or deprivation) in the recovery room and intensive care unit, and by staff tension. Modification of the intensive care unit environment, the administration of antipsychotic drugs, and metabolic correctives are recommended. Preoperative psychologic evaluation, with therapy as needed, preliminary familiarization with perioperative procedures, as well as collaboration between psychiatrist and surgeon, can do much to prevent post-cardiotomy delirium.",

Epilepsy is defined as at least two unprovoked (or reflex) seizures occurring greater than 24 hours apart or one unprovoked (or reflex) seizure and a probability of further seizures similar to the general recurrence risk after two unprovoked seizures, occurring over the next 10 years [5]. The most important diagnostic tool is the history. The examination is very often normal unless the patient has a structural brain lesion. The history should include the following information:• The presence or absence of an aura, which is a recurrent stereotypic abnormal sensation or experience. The aura is a simple partial seizure or focal seizure without impairment of consciousness or awareness according to the newly proposed classification of seizures and epilepsies [6].",

Manusia tidak secara tiba tiba menjadi tua, tetapi berkembang dari bayi, anak-anak, dewasa dan akhirnya menjadi tua. Masa tua merupakan masa hidup manusia yang terakhir atau periode penutup dalam rentang hidup seseorang, masa ini di mulai usia enam puluh sampai meninggal yang di tandai dengan adanya perubahan fisik, psikologis, sosial dan spiritual yang semakin menurun. Penyakit yang sering dijumpai pada lansia adalah hipertensi berdampak pada jantung dan stroke. Pengobatan hipertensi berlangsung seumur hidup sehingga harus dikombinasikan dengan pengobatan non farmakologis yaitu relaksasi napas dalam.  Proses menua akan terjadi perubahan-perubahan baik anatomis, biologis, fisiologis maupun psikologis. Gejala-gejala kemunduran fisik antara lain kulit mulai mengendur, timbul keriput, mulai beruban, pendengaran dan penglihatan berkurang, mudah lelah, gerakan mulai lamban dan kurang lincah masalah tersebut akan berpotensi pada masalah kesehatan baik secara umum maupun kesehatan jiwa adalah satu kesehatan jiwa yang terganggu adalah mengalami kecemasan. Rasa cemas ini merupakan keadaan mental yang tidak enak berkenaan dengan sakit yang mengancam atau yang dibayangkan, ditandai oleh kekawatiran, ketidakenakan dan perasa tidak baik yang tidak dapat dihindari, disertai perasaan tidak berdaya karena merasa menemui jalan buntu dan kemampuan untuk menemukan pemecahan masalah terhadap masalah yang diahadapi. Tujuan relaksasi nafas dalam adalah mencapai keadaan relaksasi menyeluruh, mencakup keadaan relaksasi secara fisiologis, secara kognitif, dan secara behavioral. Secara fisiologis, keadaan relaksasi ditandai dengan penurunan kadar epinefrin dan non epinefrin dalam darah, penurunan frekuensi denyut jantung (sampai mencapai 24 kali per menit), penurunan tekanan darah, penurunan frekuensi nafas (sampai 4-6 kali per menit), penurunan ketegangan otot, metabolisme menurun, vasodilatasi dan peningkatan temperature pada extermitas. Kata Kunci : Cemas, Lansia, Hipertensi, Relaksasi Nafas Dalam ABSRACT Elderly (elderly) is part of the human development process. Humans do not suddenly get old, but develop from babies, children, adults and eventually become old. Old age is the last period of human life or the closing period in a person's life span, this period from the age of sixty to death which is marked by decreasing physical, psychological, social and spiritual changes. A disease that is often found in the elderly is hypertension which affects the heart and stroke. Hypertension treatment lasts a lifetime so it must be combined with non-pharmacological treatment, namely deep breath relaxation. The aging process will result in anatomical, biological, physiological and psychological changes. Symptoms of physical deterioration include sagging skin, wrinkles, graying, reduced hearing and vision, fatigue, slow movement and less agility.These problems will potentially lead to health problems both in general and mental health is a disturbed mental health. is experiencing anxiety. This anxiety is an uncomfortable mental state with regard to threatening or imagined pain, characterized by unavoidable worry, displeasure and bad feelings, accompanied by feelings of helplessness due to feeling stuck and the ability to find solutions to problems. faced. The goal of deep breath relaxation is to achieve a state of complete relaxation, including a physiological, cognitive, and behavioral state of relaxation. Physiologically, a state of relaxation is characterized by decreased levels of epinephrine and non-epinephrine in the blood, decreased heart rate (up to 24 times per minute), decreased blood pressure, decreased breathing frequency (up to 4-6 times per minute), decreased muscle tension, decreased metabolism, vasodilation and increased temperature at extermitas.

      "abstract": "The concept of analgo-sedation in intensive care medicine has changed considerably since the last decades. Deep sedation, keeping patients artificially unconscious, is not necessary anymore, it postpones weaning from mechanical ventilation, it provokes complications, and prolongs the length of ICU stay. On the other hand, recent surveys have shown that patients recall their intensive care experience still as stressing and painful. This need more awareness of patient's pain and the readiness to give analgesics particularly before painful procedures. The frightening environment of the ICU, sleep deprivation, pain and discomfort related not only to the actual dysfunctions, but even more to the stressing procedures of care and treatment, make a certain level of sedation necessary. But patients' discomfort may also originate from many other reasons, such as hypoxaemia, hypotension, cardiac failure, drugs overdose or withdrawal, or simply from an uncomfortable body position. These sometimes non-obvious reasons have to be carefully looked for in order to treat the problem effectively. Delirium and other mental problems are common in critically ill patients. They have to be diagnosed with particular attention and treated specifically. Sedatives must be carefully adapted to the individual needs and the actual situation. Modern modes of mechanical ventilation allows lower levels of sedation. Regularly repeated assessment of the sedation level (e.g. by Ramsay score) is mandatory; a sedation protocol seems advantageous. To avoid inadvertent accumulation and overdose, it is recommended to keep the patient at a sedation level at which communication is still possible. A daily interruption of the sedation has shown to shorten the duration of mechanical ventilation and the length of ICU stay.",

Our clinical experience shows that these conditions, in this age group, at the moment of admission to hospital treatment, are much more frequent than relapse of chronic endogenous psychosis. Many somatic condition, activation of chronic diseases and subclinical disorders, consequences of previous head trauma (that patient don’t even remember), side effects of most commonly used drugs in the general and internal medicine (benzodiazepines, hypnotics, anticholinergics, antihypertensives, and drugs used in the treatment of arthritis), can cause mental confusion, anxiety and psychomotor agitation – which are conditions similar to dementia. It is very often that mild dehydration is sufficient to cause deterioration in mental status, accompanied by the emergence of nocturnal agitation, confusion, and delirious clouded consciousness. The risk of the manifestation of side effects of psychomotor drugs in geriatric patients becomes much higher due to the exhaustion of adaptive reserves of the central nervous system and cardiovascular system, and due to the delayed liver and kidney function. Implementation of antipsychotics with simpler pharmacodynamic effect is justified to calm the patient. However, later treatment should be directed to compensate the volume of fluid, to correct the electrolyte imbalance, and to treat the root causes that led to the manifestation of psychopathological phenomenology.",

      "title": "Melatonin for Sundown Syndrome and Delirium in Dementia: Is It Effective?",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: The terms \"sundown syndrome\" or \"sundowning\" are used to describe a wide range of neuropsychiatric symptoms occurring in individuals with dementia in the late afternoon, evening, or night.1 These symptoms include confusion, restlessness, anxiety, agitation, aggression, pacing, wandering, screaming, yelling, and hallucinations. The treatment of sundown syndrome is challenging, and pharmacological therapies are not particularly effective. An 81-year-old man with Alzheimer's disease diagnosed 4 years previously was admitted to the elderly department because of behavioral disturbances, sleep disorders, and wandering. His wife said that his cognitive and functional impairments had gradually worsened over the past 4 years and that, in the last 6 months, her husband had become verbally aggressive, agitated, and restless; wandered; and paced. He did not sleep for long and had difficulty falling asleep. The symptoms increased in the late afternoon and at night. He had no hallucinations or delusions. One month before admission, delirium was suspected, and his general practitioner prescribed haloperidol, but it was not effective. Physical and neurological examination showed no abnormalities. He scored 8 out of 30 on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) (indicating severe cognitive impairment) and 50 on the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) (indicating severe behavioral disturbances). Blood and urine test results were normal. During admission, sundown syndrome was diagnosed, and he received pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions for behavioral and sleep disturbances, but none was effective, and some aggravated symptoms. The pharmacological interventions consisted of benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, cholinesterase inhibitors, mood stabilizers, and antidepressants, all given in an optimal dosing schedule. After extensive review of his history, the effect of past treatments, and the published literature, melatonin was started at a dose of 2 mg at 8:00 p.m. for sleep disorders. Not only did his sleep quality improve within a week, but there was also significant improvement in his behavior within 2 hours of initiation of melatonin. A therapeutic trial with an additional dose of 2 mg given at 3:00 p.m. was started, and his symptoms gradually improved over the subsequent 2 weeks (NPI score 20). No behavioral changes were observed in the 2-month follow-up. The prevalence of sundown syndrome in individuals with dementia is estimated to be 2.4% to 66%.1 This wide variation is primarily due to the numerous definitions of the disorder. Several studies have reported that the circadian rhythm, which melatonin regulates, may be an important factor contributing to sundown syndrome.2, 3 Melatonin secretion is low or dysregulated in individuals with dementia, with levels of melatonin detected in the cerebrospinal fluid of controls being almost five times as high as those in individuals with Alzheimer's disease.3, 4 In addition, previous randomized controlled trials and case series have found that melatonin significantly improves sundown syndrome in individuals with dementia.5-7 All of these studies had some limitations, such as different definitions of sundown syndrome, small sample size, different settings (home, hospital), and various dosages of melatonin. One study reported that melatonin (n = 24; placebo, n = 17) did not significantly affect sleep, circadian rhythms, or agitation in individuals with dementia.8 It is important to differentiate sundown syndrome from delirium because of differences in treatment and prognosis. Delirium is characterized by an acute onset of changes in cognition and behavior, a fluctuating course during the day, and an altered level of consciousness.9 In general, it can be caused by a medical condition, drug or substance intoxication, or withdrawal.9 Delirium may gradually improve as the primary problem resolves or the medical condition becomes stable. Sundown syndrome is characterized by a rapid onset or exacerbation of the usual behaviors that occur every day at the same time, in the late afternoon, evening, or night. Although it has been suggested that physiological and environmental factors contribute to the development of this syndrome, no cause is typically found in most individuals.1 The pharmacological interventions for delirium are better documented than those for sundown syndrome. Sundown syndrome and delirium share many symptoms, but it is not known whether they share the same pathophysiological mechanisms, although the circadian rhythm pathway is implicated in both conditions.2, 3, 10 It has been suggested that dysregulation of melatonin secretion is associated with postoperative delirium in elderly adults,10 but only two articles were found on the efficacy of melatonin as treatment for delirium in the literature.11, 12 The first reported two cases;11 one was a 53-year-old man successfully treated with melatonin for severe postoperative delirium unresponsive to antipsychotics or benzodiazepines, and the second was a 78-year-old man with a history of postoperative delirium who was given melatonin to prevent another episode of postoperative delirium. He did not develop postoperative delirium on melatonin. The second article reported that low-dose melatonin (0.5 mg/d) given every night for 14 days or until discharge was associated with lower risk of delirium than placebo in elderly adults (n = 72; mean age 84.5).12 Further adequately powered randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm the effectiveness of melatonin in the management of neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementia. Until then, melatonin could be considered a treatment option, especially in individuals who fail to respond to other interventions.

Migraine and post-traumatic headache share similar pathophysiologic mechanisms, and both can considerably decrease quality of life. The development of post-traumatic headache or post-traumatic migraine must be differentiated from concussion, and requires specific management to address headache manifestations. Although there are no approved pharmacologic treatments specific to post-traumatic headache, emerging strategies focus on treatment paradigms similar to migraine management. Failure to address post-traumatic headache and post-traumatic migraine will lead to prolonged post-concussive symptoms and the misunderstanding that such prolonged symptoms are a result of incomplete recovery from concussion.",

      "abstract": "Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (AD/HD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder present from childhood and often following individuals into adulthood. It is the most frequent reason for referring children to mental health services. Core symptoms of AD/HD (inattention, impulsivity, hyperactivity) present behaviors that parents may rate in standardized questionnaires (e.g., does not study, memory problems, cannot concentrate, cannot stay still, has no motives, etc.), are also present in other developmental or psychiatric disorders (e.g., specific learning difficulties, sensory modulation disorder, mood or anxiety disorders, autistic spectrum disorders). This may cause errors in the differential diagnosis if clinicians do not add objective measures of cognitive deficits associated with each disorder. AD/HD presents neuropsychological deficits (compared to non-clinical populations) that are also present in other disorders, like deficient working memory, whereas other neuropsychological deficits are unique characteristics of AD/HD, such as sustained attention, response inhibition, and variability of response time. Likewise, anxiety disorders present neuropsychological deficits in autobiographical memory, mood disorders present neuropsychological deficits in processing speed and verbal memory. Neuropsychological tests such as the Continuous Performance Test, tests of reading phonetic decoding, and others, may improve the accuracy of differential diagnosis, differentiating AD/HD from other disorders, or revealing the comorbidity of AD/HD with other disorders.",

      "abstract": "regoli delusion, first described by Courbon and Fail in 1927, named after an Italian actor Leopoldo Fregoli, is a rare delusional misidentification syndrome which entails that different people are in fact the same person in disguise who is able to change their appearance [1]. It is commonly linked to schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and other organic brain syndromes including head trauma, ischaemic strokes, AD, Parkinson’s disease, epilepsy or metabolic derangements [2]. Neurologically, it represents a disconnectivity syndrome of hyperidentification (cf. Capgras) [3]. As TBI sequelae, psychotic symptoms may occur early or late [4]. In the early postinjury period, psychotic symptoms are most commonly manifestations of post-traumatic delirium. In the late postinjury period, these symptoms may be either part of a schizophrenia-like psychosis, comprising predominantly persecutory delusions, auditory hallucinations and dearth of negative symptoms, or be associated features of a mood disorder. The best available epidemiological evidence suggests that TBI confers a modest increased risk for schizophrenia-like psychosis especially if coupled with a positive family history of psychosis and male gender [5]. TBI renders patients more susceptible to neurologic side effects of antipsychotics [6].Here, we are reporting an adolescent with TBI that later on developed Fregoli delusions. He had supersensitivity to multiple antipsychotic trials with no response at all. When shifted to low-dose clozapine, delusions entirely remitted with great tolerability. A 15-year-old Palestinian youngster was casualty petitioned in accompaniment of his parents for paranoid ideations of 3 months duration. He is the youngest of 3 sibs emanating from nonconsanguenious monogamous family with no genetic load of neuropsychiatric disorders. Unremarkable developmental trajectories. Distinguished scholastic achievement. No history of smoking or illicit drug use. No medical comorbidities. Had a history of MVA, 10 months ago, incurred severe TBI, admitt ed to ICU, discharged on prophylactic Valproate 1000 mg/d for posttraumatic seizures. He was faring well following this accident, as reported by parents, apart from occasional complaints of low-grade headaches and giddiness. Lately, he started to voice out non-sensical talk that the man who hit him by the car is disguising and morphing in the bodies of neighbours, doorkeeper and servants, stalking him in order to kill him. He was panic-stricken by the idea. Fragmented sleep. Lost appetite. Dropped from school attainment.

      "abstract": "O status epilepticus (SE), e uma condicao resultante da falha dos mecanismos responsaveis\r\npelo termino da crise ou pelo inicio de mecanismos que levam a crises anormalmente\r\nprolongadas. Uma crise epileptica e definida como “a ocorrencia transitoria de sinais e/ou\r\nsintomas secundarios a atividade neuronal cerebral anormal”. A epilepsia e uma sindrome\r\nencefalica definida por pelo menos uma das seguintes condicoes: (1) pelo menos 2 crises\r\nepilepticas nao provocadas em um intervalo superior a 24 horas; (2) uma convulsao nao \r\nprovocada em individuos que possuem fatores associados a uma maior probabilidade de\r\napresentar um limiar epileptico diminuido; (3) diagnostico de sindrome da epilepsia.\r\nIndividuos com epilepsia apresentam mais chances de sofrer morte subita, sendo a morte\r\nsubita e inesperada na epilepsia (SUDEP) a categoria mais comum. O modelo de epilepsia\r\ninduzida por pilocarpina (EIP) tem sido o mais usado para estudar a epilepsia do lobo\r\ntemporal (ELT). Sabe-se que o sistema renina angiotensina (SRA) esta envolvido em algumas\r\ndoencas neurodegenerativas, bem como na epilepsia. E, ja foi demonstrado que areas do\r\nsistema nervoso central (SNC) responsaveis pelo comportamento de sede e apetite ao sodio\r\nsao afetadas por este modelo de epilepsia. Desta forma, este estudo buscou estudar o\r\ncontrole cardiovascular frente a alteracoes dos niveis centrais de angiotensina II (Ang II),\r\ncarbacol e osmolaridade plasmatica no modelo EIP. Para isso foram utilizados ratos Wistar\r\n(250-280 g), pre tratados com metilescopolamina (1mg/kg intraperitoneal -i.p.) em seguida\r\nreceberam uma injecao de pilocarpina (350 mg/kg –ip) para inducao do SE. Apos 3 horas de\r\nSE, foi injetado dizepam (10 mg/kg -i.p.) para interromper a crise. Foram feitos o\r\nacompanhamento de ingestao diaria de agua e NaCl 1,8%, em que nao foi encontrada\r\ndiferenca entre os grupos, e do peso corporal em que o grupo com epilepsia obteve um ganho\r\nde peso menor quando comparado ao grupo controle (358 ± 13 vs. 406 ± 6 g,\r\nrespectivamente). Animais previamente preparados com cânulas direcionadas ao ventriculo\r\nlateral (VL) foram divididos em dois grupos os quais foram submetidos a registro dos\r\nparâmetros cardiovasculares: um grupo que recebeu injecao intracerebroventricular (icv) de\r\nAng II e outro de carbacol. Observamos que a resposta pressora foi maior no grupo com\r\nepilepsia quando comparado ao controle apos a injecao de Ang II (epilepsia: 28,0 ± 3,3 vs.\r\nControle: 13,3 ± 0,7 mmHg, p<0,05), a variacao da frequencia cardiaca (ΔFC) nao foi\r\ndiferente entre os grupos. Nos animais que receberam injecao icv de carbacol, a resposta\r\npressora nao foi diferente entre os grupos, mas houve diferenca dentro dos grupos\r\ncomparando com o basal (-0,5 ± 1,4 vs. 22,3 ± 4,6 mmHg, epilepsia e 1,0 ± 2,3 vs. 24,3 ±\r\n4,0 mmHg, controle, p<0,05), a Δ FC foi diferente entre os grupos (Epilepsia: -24,3 ± 6,1 vs.\r\nControle: -56,3 ± 13,2 bpm), bem como dentro do grupo controle comparando seu periodo\r\nbasal ao periodo pos-injecao de carbacol (396,7 ± 17,0 vs. -56,3 ± 13,2 bpm,\r\nrespectivamente). Em outro experimento, os animais foram submetidos ao registro apos a\r\nsobrecarga intragastrica de NaCl 12%, os quais apresentaram uma queda da pressao nos\r\ntempos 30, 40 e 50 min no grupo com epilepsia quando comparamos ao periodo de 10\r\nminutos apos a gavagem (10’: 5,6 ± 2,9 vs. 30’: -8,0 ± 5,3 mmHg; 40’: -11,5 ± 4,9 mmHg;\r\n50’: -9,0 ± 4,5 mmHg). Esta queda nao foi observada nos animais controle. Quanto a Δ FC\r\nnao houve diferenca entre os grupos, porem no grupo com epilepsia houve um aumento apos\r\na gavagem quando comparamos os tempos -10, -1, 40, 50 e 60 minutos (10’: 49,2 ± 23,0\r\nvs. -10’: 0,0 ± 0,0 bpm; -1’: -5,7 ± 11,1 bpm; 40’: 3,5 ± 7,3 bpm; 50’: -7,0 ± 9,6 bpm e\r\n60’: -5,7 ± 11,3 bpm). Nossos resultados sugerem que a epilepsia induzida por pilocarpina e\r\ncapaz de alterar mecanismos centrais dependentes de angiotensina, carbacol e aumento da\r\nosmolaridade plasmatica que alteram o controle da pressao arterial prejudicando o organismo\r\nem situacoes corriqueiras e contribuindo para a SUDEP.",

      "abstract": "Common psychiatric problems in cancer patients include depression, anxiety, sleep disturbance, and delirium. Yet the diagnosis of psychiatric disorders in the medical setting can be complicated by the symptoms of disease or the side effects of treatment. Somatic symptoms from cancer obfuscate the diagnosis of mood disorders and other psychiatric disorders. Valuable tools such as opioid analgesics, steroids, and anticholinergic medications may produce undesirable psychiatric side effects. Adverse effects (including delirium, mania, and depression) as well as milder effects (such as irritability, insomnia, and weight gain) may impair quality of life. One major challenge to psychiatric diagnosis presents itself during end-of-life care. In this case, it may be difficult to distinguish between primary psychiatric disorders and end-of-life distress. Psychosocial stressors, unrelated to disease or treatment, can occur and sometimes complicate management. Patients' reactions to recommended treatments may be related to other issues, such as grief, frustration, or need for control. As a result, the diagnosis of mood disorders may require input by mental health professionals.",

Immediate postinjury objective signs of concussion are a person being dazed, confused, and disoriented, new onset of feeling nauseous or throwing up, or a period of loss of consciousness. Other postconcussion signs may include brief neurological impairments such as not being able to stand, walk, or converse sensibly immediately afterward. Acute subjective symptoms of concussion include feeling lightheaded, “seeing stars,” having blurred vision, headaches, or experiencing ringing in the ears. Postconcussion syndrome (PCS), as the name suggests, is a characteristic complex of subjective symptoms that occurs subsequent to a concussion. In the vast majority of individuals these symptoms resolve within a time period ranging from minutes to 24–72 hours. Although some symptoms may last for days, approximately 90 percent or more of individuals who sustain a concussion are asymptomatic within a couple of weeks.",

      "title": "HYSTERICAL PSYCHOSIS",
      "abstract": "The term hysterical psychosis has been in common usage for longer than half a century, but it has never become part of the standard nomenclature. Indeed, there is no single article in the literature in which hysterical psychosis as an entity is described and the subject discussed. We have set down how the term is used to provide a fixed point of reference for support or criticism. Our conceptualization of the process is essentially in agreement with Freud's formulation in his second article on the neuropsychoses insofar as we view the disturbance as a form of ego disruption. Descriptively, hysterical psychosis is marked by a sudden and dramatic onset temporally related to a profoundly upsetting event or circumstance. Its manifestations include hallucinations, delusions, depersonalization and grossly unusual behavior. Thought disorders, when they occur, are usually sharply circumscribed and very transient. Affectivity, if altered, is changed in the direction of volatility and not flatness. The acute episode seldom lasts longer than one to 3 weeks, and the eruption is sealed off so that there is practically no residue. Hysterical psychosis is encountered most commonly in persons referred to as hysterical characters or personalities when faced by trying life situations or problems. Statements received from correspondents were consistent generally with our viewpoint. Case notes have been presented to illustrate certain aspects of the clinical picture.",

There are several types of disorder of thought train, such as loosing of association, flight of idea, incoherence, inhibition of thought, blocking of thought, circumstantial thinking and perseveration.

If the elderly patients show these symptoms with psychosis, mania and depression, the organic or drug induced mental disorder should be excluded. Patients with aphasia or parkinsonism also should be paid attention to examine train of thought, so they often seem to have inhibition of thought and blocking of thought.",

      "abstract": "The effects of LSD are characterized by a number of disturbances of perception and experience, which can be observed in the fields of visual, spatial and temporal perception and of affectivity. We also see disturbances of experience, which can otherwise be observed only in psychoses, for example reduction or change of cognitive functions, but also depersonalization and euphoria. In atypical courses of intoxication (\"horror-trips\") anxiety and excitement are predominant. Atypical courses of intoxication may be interrupted by \"talk down\" and additional application of tranquilizers. In a certain number of LSD-users in our clinic we saw psychoses. We classify them into flash-backs, exogenic (toxic) psychoses and so-called \"endoform psychoses\". The latter implies three possible constellations: accidental coincidence of LSD-use and psychosis; pre-existing psychosis with symptomatic use of LSD as an attempt of self-treatment; finally the onset of a psychosis may be triggered by the use of the halluzinogen. From the symptomatological cross-section they cannot reliably be distinguished from real schizophrenia. An independent nosological unit \"LSD-psychosis\" does not seem to exist.",

Lesional headaches follow a sinusitis or an arthrosis, or accompany a \"temporal arteritis of Horton\". Funstional headaches include several varieties. 1. Trigemellar neuralgia. 2.Vascular algi originating from the basal arteries, the large cerebral venous sinuses or the branches of the external carotid. Among these are: a) headaches due to a dilatation of the internal wall, causing \"Horton headache\", migraine-like psychosomatic migraine and hormonal migraines (premenstrual, menstrual, menopausal or linked to the use of contraceptive pills); b) headaches caused by an angiospasm of the arteriole, which is the case in exposure to the cold, in traumatic headaches (malfunction of temporomandibular articulation, dry alveolitis), in psychosomatic angiospastic algias and in ethmoidal artery algias preciously described by the author in 1949 (Godin's disease).3. Headaches due to psychic hypertension. 4. Postconcussional psychogenic headaches. 5. Neurotic headaches. The author gives a detailed description of the subjective symptoms in each case, including localisation, from, intensity, duration course and associated phenomenons. This facilitates greatly the differential diagnosis and the choice of complementary examinations. Necessary biological investigations should be performed (e.g. hormonal balance). One should however avoid to increase the number of complementary examination which would only delay treatement and would expose patients to somatisation. Furthermore, in each case drug treatment, periarterial infiltration technics of the temporal, internal frontal, facial, mastoid and occipital arteries are described. The necessity of questioning the patient at lenght and to listen to him to enable him to verbalise conscious conflicts is emphasized. A serious medicopsychlogical examination and a relaxation treatment to reduce anxiety and muscular tension are advised in some cases.",

The first includes disorders of arousals, namely confusional arousals (and their recently identified variants of sleep-related abnormal sexual behaviors), sleep terrors, and sleepwalking. REM sleep parasomnias include REM sleep behavior disorder, recurrent isolated sleep paralysis, and nightmare disorders. Other parasomnias include sleep enuresis, sleep-related groaning, exploding head syndrome, sleep-related hallucinations, and sleep-related eating disorder. The latter shares many features with the disorders of arousals, being frequently associated to sleepwalking. Hence, parasomnias comprise a variety of abnormal sleep-related movements, behaviors, emotions, dreaming, and autonomic phenomena that emerge from sleep as an expression of an anomalous central nervous system activation during sleep.",

In the elderly, it involves a rapid cognitive decline from the preexisting level of functioning (whatever that might be) involving conscious level, orientation, attention, memory and concentration. The mental state fluctuates from minute to minute or hour to hour, often worse in the evenings than mornings. There are perceptual abnormalities (illusions, hallucinations and misrecognition), affective changes (apathy, lability, irritability, autonomic arousal), persecutory or terrifying ideas, behavioral changes (hypokinesis or hyperkinesis), and motor features – ‘plucking’ and pointing are common. It is an unpleasant state with a high mortality and a high risk of adverse iatrogenic consequences. In approximately 85% of recognised cases, one or more physical causes can be identified, for example infection, intoxication with prescribed drugs, and cardiovascular, respiratory and metabolic disease. In the other 15%, psychologic factors such as removal from home, grief, depression or acute psychotic illness are sufficient to precipitate delirium. The risk of delirium appears to rise with age and underlying cerebral disease.",

      "title": "Being psychotic is not necessarily being ill: Psychotic continuum and the relevance of lacanian psychoanalytic approach",
      "abstract": "Introduction The notion of subclinical psychosis is as old as Eugen Bleuler’s work on schizophrenia. It is also consistent with psychodynamic theories (see PDM-2) on the organization of personality on different levels including, among others, a psychotic level of personality organization. Research on the continuum of psychosis has offered substantial support to the view that psychotic phenotypes are significantly more prevalent than clinical psychosis. Objectives This may imply that being “psychotic” is not necessarily being ill. This assumption raises important theoretical and clinical questions: what causes psychosis to manifest itself clinically and, conversely, what possibly prevents it from doing so? Methods At the same time, it potentially frees psychiatry from certain diagnostic and therapeutic impasses. It allows for a shift of emphasis from misguiding classifications and often frustrating “evidence-based” therapeutic attempts to a more personalized approach. Results Diagnosis may thus rely on psychoanalytical “markers” or “indicators” regarding the subject (e.g. deficits in the symbolic register, dysregulated rapport with one’s body, problematic inscription in social relations etc.) at least as much as on symptomic phenomenology. Therapy may also take advantage of and deploy the unique coping strategies employed by the psychotic individual. Conclusions The diagnostic and therapeutic insights offered by Lacanian psychoanalysis create the possibility of a fruitful theoretical, diagnostic and therapeutic approach for clinical and subclinical psychotic conditions; indicate that psychoanalysis is indispensable for clinical psychiatry; and signal the possibility of a time-honored alternative to the in-vogue neurocognitive paradigm of “personalized” psychiatry.

Factors such as substance use or withdrawal, related psychosocial stressors, and co-occurring somatic health problems complicate the diagnostic process. Addressing psychiatric symptoms is essential to optimizing treatment of substance use disorders. Medications can help but may be unnecessary once substance use is stabilized. Other approaches include counseling, psychotherapy, case coordination, and inpatient or residential care. There are additional issues that arise with specific psychiatric disorders, including mood disorders (depression and bipolar), anxiety and trauma-related disorders (post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD]), psychotic disorders, personality disorders, and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).",

      "abstract": "Medicinal sedatives are a class of drugs that reduce brain activity. You can usually utilise them to relax yourself. Sedatives are usually prescribed by doctors to address conditions like anxiety and sleep problems. Additionally, they are used as general anaesthetics. Regulated chemicals include sedatives.Sedatives, which include benzodiazepines, selective benzodiazepine receptor subtype agonists (z-drugs), and barbiturates, are commonly prescribed for anxiety or insomnia. These sedatives are considered banned substances because of the possibility of abuse and misuse. Self-medication (pharmaceutical management) of psychological issues is a common form of addiction, commonly manifested as dose increase and early prescription requests. Sedative abuse can be dangerous because it can have psychoactive effects. A reversal drug called flumazenil can be used to treat some sedative overdoses combined with supportive care. Tapering the sedative is used to treat sedative symptoms of withdrawal, which may require treatment. Counseling need for the long-term treatment of sedative addiction, typically with the help of a specialist in addiction treatment. We realized subjective experiences remembered during responsive and unconscious sedation brought on by oxidative dosages of dexmedetomidine, propofol, sevoflurane, and S-ketamine in order to better understand how anaesthetics with various molecular processes affect consciousness. The quantity or nature of reported experiences were not affected by responsiveness at the conclusion of anaesthesia delivery. These results suggested the prevalence of subjective sensations during responsive and unresponsive sedation as well as the diversity of anaesthetic drugs' molecular structures.Despite the fact that main analysis the variations between medicines were slight, different mechanisms of action may have different effects on the prevalence and complexity of the experiences.Alcohol's sedative properties during the first few drinks have received the majority of attention in studies on those with poor subjective response to alcohol. This study looked at individual responses and to the sedative and stimulating effects of alcohol when first consuming it. Experiences as indicators of the degree of alcoholism in treated teenagers.",

      "title": "Considerations on third generation antihistamines",
      "abstract": "For several months now, the term ‘third generation of antihistamines’ has emerged spontaneously from the medical literature. These attempts at definition, which vary greatly, create confusion both for the health professionals and the lay public. This is of considerable concern for the scientific community involved in allergy, mainly due to the lack of consensus. One definition refers to the active metabolites of new second generation drugs as the basis for a third one [1,2]. Others are focused on certain specific properties: no electrocardiogram (ECG) effects [3], rapid onset of action [4] or no drug interactions [3]. First generation antihistamines were defined by their H1 receptor blocking power and despite pronounced unwanted side-effects are still often used mainly in over-the-counter (OTC) products, alone or in combination with other drugs. The second generation antihistamines are said to be ‘non-sedating H1 blockers’ due to the lack of penetration through the blood-brain barrier. Compared to the first generation, they are known for their high potency and minimal central nervous system (CNS) effects. Numerous compounds have been created responding to their own pharmacokinetics. Some of them undergo extensive metabolism, others do not. Cardiotoxic effects emerged with some second generation antihistamines and most of the new compounds exhibit properties on systems other than H1 receptors, i.e. anti-inflammatory properties. Certainly, the second generation manifests a great diversity. Which criteria should drugs have to fulfil to be labelled as third generation antihistamine? This is obviously for the scientific community to answer. To pave the way for the elaboration of a consensual definition and with the support of the British Society for Allergy and Clinical Immunology, a Consensus Group on New Generation Antihistamines (CONGA) has been set up. This Group is led by Professor S. T. Holgate (UK) and includes Professor G. W. Canonica (Italy), Dr G. Scadding (UK), Professor F. Estelle R. Simons (Canada), Professor M. Tharp (USA), Professor H. Timmerman (the Netherlands) and Professor K. Yanai (Japan), so that there will be a multidisciplinary input. This exercise is closely linked to the Southampton Workshop ‘Antihistamines: Back to the Future’[5] and should appear as a necessary sequel after a 4-year evolution of the antihistamine class. The Consensus Group met for the first time at the University of Leuven (Belgium), June 11–12, 2001, and made clear the necessity to clarify the theme with the help of international experts representing the different fields involved in allergy. Respecting a strictly academic approach, the Consensus Group agreed on the following aims: (a) to review in depth the present status of the term ‘third generation antihistamines’, (b) to analyse the potential criteria that drugs should fulfil to be labelled as third generation, (c) to find gaps and to bridge them with the back-up of expert networking, and (d) to issue a consensual statement endorsed by the scientific community.",

      "abstract": "Definition of stroke In epidemiological studies, stroke is defined by clinical findings and symptoms [1]: rapidly developed signs of focal (or global) disturbance of cerebral function lasting more than 24 hours (unless interrupted by surgery or death), with no apparent cause other than a vascular origin. This approach is supplemented with neuroimaging but even with advanced imaging techniques the diagnosis is based on clinical signs. Therefore, precise definitions of clinical signs are needed. WHO definitions are [1]: Definite focal signs: unilateral or bilateral motor impairment (including dyscoordination) unilateral or bilateral sensory impairment aphasis/dysphasis (non-fluent speech) hemianopia (half-sided impairment of visual fields) diplopia forced gaze (conjugate deviation) dysphagia of acute onset apraxia of acute onset ataxia of acute onset perception deficit of acute onset. Not acceptable as sole evidence of focal dysfunction: dizziness, vertigo localized headache blurred vision of both eyes dysarthria (slurred speech) impaired cognitive function (including confusion) impaired consciousness seizures. (Although strokes can present in this way, these signs are not specific and cannot therefore be accepted as definite evidence of stroke.) Neuroimaging studies are needed for classification of stroke by subtypes: subarachnoid hemorrhage, intracerebral hemorrhage and brain infarction (necrosis). Although there may be large variations in stroke subtype distributions between populations, thrombotic and embolic strokes are responsible for about 80–85% of all strokes in the Indo-European populations, and as low as 65% in some Asian populations. Subarachnoid hemorrhage represents 5–10% of all strokes, and occurs more often in younger subjects, while both intracerebral and especially thrombotic and embolic stroke increase markedly with age.",

Insomnia can result from multiple causes including psychiatric or general medical disorders, medication effects, substance abuse, and other sleep disorders.

      "abstract": "Abstract Withdrawal-emergent adverse effects of antipsychotics are an infrequently identified condition which can appear during antipsychotic dose reduction and medication change. In this paper, we present the case of severe extrapyramidal symptoms after a dose reduction of risperidone is presented. A patient, 23 years of age, was admitted to a health care facility due to an unexpected change in his behavior, with paranoid delusions, incoherent thinking, and significant anxiety. An initial risperidone treatment was soon changed to zuclopenhixol. Subsequently, severe extrapyramidal symptoms appeared, after which the medication was switched back to resperidone. Following this treatment, the patient left the health care facility and stopped the medication of his own volition. Psychotic symptoms and massive extrapyramidal symptoms again occurred. These symptoms subsided only slowly during a subsequent treatment with olanzapine. The development of adverse neurological effects together with a worsening of productive psychotic symptomatology may be explained by withdrawal of antipsychotic medication. These symptoms are often attributed to new medications, which are prematurely discontinued after the appearance of an adverse effect, but which are potentially beneficial to a patient, provided that enough time for a spontaneous subsidence of withdrawal-emergent effects is given. Any change in antipsychotic treatment should be carefully considered and thoroughly planned.",

Specifically, major depressive disorder (MDD) is a psychiatric condition in which diagnostic criteria require five or more depressive symptoms, one of which must include either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure. Other depressive symptoms include significant weight loss, sleep changes (i.e., insomnia or hypersomnia), psychomotor agitation or retardation, fatigue or loss of energy, feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt, diminished ability to think or concentrate, and recurrent thoughts of death. MDD is also distinguished from normal symptoms of sadness by criteria for symptom severity and duration: symptoms of depression must have been present during the same two-week period, be present all or most of the time, and represent a change from a previous level of functioning.",

      "title": "Burnout syndrome",
      "abstract": "Online dictionaries provide a suggestive translation for the burnout concept: \"The tubes burned out easily and had to be constantly replaced...\".This is the sequence of events that leads to the syndrome: the depletion of one's own intellectual energy, usually directly tied to the profession one has, presumably exerted with great passion and dedication, after a long lasting effort.The most accurate definition, including the eventual prophylactic actions to be taken, is based on the context in which this syndrome manifests: the surpassing of one's resistance to professional effort and of one's capability to recuperate (1,17).Its manifestation, perceived by others and by the affected individual consists of behaviors and feelings, more or less subjective, noticed by the individual and/or those around him/her.The most common symptoms overlap those found in various types of depression: fatigue, insomnia, difficulty concentrating, irritability, depressed mood, lack of pleasure and motivation for daily activities concerning -surprisinglythose linked to professional activity.Other symptoms are included in the psychosomatic category: headaches, lumbago, gastrointestinal problems, breathing difficulties, loss of appetite, various cenesthetic complaints.If we use the word symptoms we must include our description in the biological model, which is not necessary the case here.Official psychiatric classifications do not recognize burnout as a form of depression.International Classification of Diseases (ICD 10, 1992) (2) includes this syndrome in the last chapter (amongst \"Factors influencing health status and contact with health services\" codes Z00-Z99, in \"Problems related to life management difficulty\" code Z73.0 together with other \"problems\", such as \"Accentuation of personality traits\" including type A behavior pattern, \"Lack of relaxation and leisure\", \" Stress, not elsewhere classified\", \"Inadequate social skills, not elsewhere classified\", \"Social role conflict, not elsewhere classified\", ranging from Z73.1 to Z73.5), all of which do not refer to nosological entities, but to particularities varying with context and eventually with the individual's psycho-social vulnerability.We can thus define burnout as a cumulation of psychological symptoms, more or less interchangeable with the psychiatric equivalents, already indexed among the diagnostic criteria of some psychiatric disorders (exhaustion depression, stress disorders etc.) (3).It is true that, given time, these psychological symptoms and disfunctions can translate to actual depressive symptoms.Because burnout is, in fact, a surpassed work-related state, it is wise to be aware that the onset of the symptoms might show a change in the individual's professional life.This means that the professional act, which one performs with a",

      "title": "Sialorrhea: a review of a vexing, often unrecognized sign of oropharyngeal and esophageal disease.",
      "abstract": "Saliva is produced by the major salivary glands (parotid, submandibular, and sublingual), as well as several smaller glands. Salivary flow can be altered by multiple entities. There is much written regarding xerostomia (\"dry mouth\"), the condition related to inhibited or decreased salivary flow. This condition is widely recognized in certain systemic diseases, particularly Sjögren syndrome, diabetes mellitus, after anticholinergic, antihistamine, and decongestant medications, as well as states of enhanced sympathetic drive, such as anxiety or emotional disturbances and various other psychosocial conditions. On the other hand, sialorrhea or ptyalism, the condition of increased salivary flow, is rarely discussed in the clinical literature. Sialorrhea can occur with various neurologic disorders, infections, the secretory phase of the menstrual cycle, heavy metal poisoning, Wilson disease, Angelman syndrome, as well as a relatively unknown condition called idiopathic paroxysmal sialorrhea. Normal salivation may be altered by drugs (such as clozapine, risperidone, nitrazepam, lithium, and bethanecol) that have a cholinergic effect that induces sialorrhea. This report focuses on sialorrhea as it relates to disorders of the oropharynx and esophagus. The patient typically recognizes a problem with excessive \"foamy mucus\" but does not understand its origin. Infections and obstruction are the most common oropharyngeal causes. Increased salivary flow occurs as a typically subtle manifestation of gastroesophageal reflux disease. This occurrence is referred to as water brash. Idiopathic achalasia and megaesophagus due to the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi are regularly associated with sialorrhea. Esophageal obstruction (foreign body, cancer, or stricture formation), infection, and nasogastric intubation are the more common conditions associated with the symptomatic sequelae of sialorrhea. Sialorrhea-related respiratory and pulmonary complications are greatest in those with a diminished sensation of salivary flow and hypopharyngeal retention. Extremes of age, the chronically debilitated, or those in chronic care facilities, especially associated with cerebrovascular accidents and esophageal cancer, typically comprise this population. For the patient with an intact awareness of saliva, sialorrhea can present with significant social stigmas. Occult drooling or regular oral evacuation into a tissue or \"spit cup\" is socially incapacitating. This report provides a review of the physiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and therapeutic options for sialorrhea. Physicians and other healthcare professionals should recognize the importance of sialorrhea as a possible indicator or complication of a variety of disease states of the oropharynx and esophagus as well as its impact on the patient's physical and social quality of life.",

Withdrawal dyskinesia appears under similar circumstances but disappears spontaneously in 6 to 12 weeks. Cholinergic overactivity and changes in dopamine-acetylcholine balance in the basal ganglia may underlie these withdrawal syndromes.

It is known that certain foods, food additives, alcohol, caffeine, stress, sensory stimuli, disruptions in sleep-wake patterns, hormonal changes, and many other things may trigger migraines. Red wine is a frequently reported trigger for migraines and other headaches but it is unclear what substance(s) in red wine triggers headache and why red wine is more associated with headache than white wine, sparkling wines, or spirits. Implicated as headache triggers are biogenic amines (histamine, phenylethylamine, tyramine, and others), phenols, polyphenols, and sulfites. Enzymatic action in the metabolism of phenols and polyphenols may cause fluctuations in dopamine and serotonin levels which, in turn, have been implicated as headache triggers. The role of sulfotransferase enzymes and dopamine appears to offer a promising explanation of the red wine headache. The investigation of potential red wine triggers may better elucidate headache pathogenesis.",

      "title": "When and How to Investigate the Patient with Headache",
      "abstract": "The common complaint of headache usually has a benign cause, most often a primary headache syndrome. The history and neurologic and general physical examinations usually permit a definitive diagnosis. When in doubt, diagnostic testing is indicated. Certain historical and examination findings increase the likelihood of a secondary headache disorder and the need for diagnostic testing. These include (1) recent head or neck injury; (2) a new, worse, worsening, or abrupt onset headache; (3) headache brought on by Valsalva maneuver or cough; (4) headache brought on by exertion; (5) headache associated with sexual activity; (6) pregnancy; (7) headache in the patient over the age of ~50; (8) neurologic findings and/or symptoms; (9) systemic signs and/or symptoms; (10) secondary risk factors, such as cancer or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Less worrisome are headaches that wake the patient from sleep at night, always occur on the same side, or show a prominent effect of change in posture on the patient's pain. Diagnostic studies include neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination, and blood tests, which are selected depending on the patient's history and findings. For most patients, the diagnostic test of choice is a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scan. Computed tomography (CT) of the brain is usually obtained in the setting of trauma or the abrupt onset of headache. CSF examination is useful in diagnosing subarachnoid bleeding, infection, and high and low CSF pressure syndromes.",

      "title": "A Changing Landscape: Traumatic Brain Injury in Military Combat and Civilian Athletics",
      "abstract": "Combat scene, a wounded or dead hoplite lies on the ground, black-figured hydria, Cleimachos (potter), 560-550 BCE. Louvre, (Museum), Paris, France. Photo credit: Erich Lessing/Art Resource, NY. Diagnosing concussion has posed a special challenge in current military conflicts, as some symptoms and clinical findings are similar to acute stress reaction and other conditions. The Department of Defense (DoD) currently defines a traumatic brain injury (TBI) as: a traumatically induced structural injury and/or physiological disruption of brain function as a result of an external force that is indicated by new onset or worsening of at least one of the following clinical signs, immediately following the event: 1) any period of loss of a decreased level of consciousness (LOC), 2) any loss of memory for events immediately before or after the injury, 3) any alteration in mental state at the time of the injury (confusion, disorientation, slowed thinking, etc.), 4) neurological deficits (weakness, loss of balance, change in vision, praxis, paresis/plegia, sensory loss, aphasia, etc.) that may or may not be transient, or 5) the presence of an intracranial lesion (1). Diagnosing TBI currently depends on a thorough history and the patient's status at the time of injury, and there is currently no single objective test or diagnostic biomarker for concussion/mild TBI (mTBI). Advancing diagnostic efforts, the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command is funding biomarker studies to identify the unique biological effects of TBI and leverage knowledge to develop more objective diagnostic tools to determine the severity of brain injury. TBI severity within the DoD are currently classified as mild/moderate/severe (1). Concussion/mTBI involves normal structural imaging, LOC for up to 30 min, alteration of consciousness up to 24 h, and post-traumatic amnesia up to 24 h. If a patient meets criteria in more than one category of severity, the provider assigns the higher severity level. Definition standardization remains a problem as concussion grading systems and definitions published by various organizations make comparing findings from various research studies extremely difficult. A collaborative effort among the DoD, Veterans Health Administration, Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, the Brain Trauma Foundation, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is developing a medically useful definition and staging criteria for mTBI/concussion. We live in a sport-crazed society, and although injury is usually an accepted consequence of “playing the game,” there is a heightened awareness about sport concussions. Pick up a newspaper, or watch the evening news or “Sports Center,” and you're bound to read or hear something about sport concussions. The media are obsessed with this topic, particularly with the negative news that makes headlines and ultimately sells newspapers. Even so, there is good news to report, and progress is being made. Forty-nine states have passed concussion laws in the past 4 years, aimed at educating athletes, parents, and coaches about the symptoms of concussion and the dangers of continuing to play while still symptomatic. According to the CDC, Emergency Department diagnosis of youth sport concussions has increased by an estimated 60% over the past decade (2). Surprisingly, this is good news, as it speaks to the increased public awareness and better recognition of concussion, as opposed to an increase in actual concussions. Concussion remains a major military concern given the short- and long-term impacts to our service members; recent conflicts have sparked an increase in TBI research funding designed to accelerate medical innovation. There were 266,810 service members in the DoD from 2000 to 2012 who were diagnosed with TBI—81.7% of these injuries concussions (3). Although the risk for TBI is certainly higher in the combat environment, the majority of these injuries (83.4%) is actually nondeployment-associated (3). In parallel to sport-concussion awareness, military medicine has also taken significant policy steps to promote early identification and concussion treatment (4). In 2010, the DoD published a policy mandating that any deployed service member involved in a potentially concussive event (such as 50 m from a blast, vehicle collision or rollover, blow to the head, etc.) receive a medical evaluation using the Military Acute Concussion Evaluation; receive a minimum 24 h of downtime, even if he was not diagnosed with a concussion; and must be re-evaluated prior to returning to duty (5). Since then, the DoD has screened over 14,950 deployed service members for concussion and has staffed 11 Concussion Care Centers in Afghanistan that promote concussion recovery and medical oversight (internal DoD data; personal communication). The U.S. Army is implementing this concept worldwide to ensure one standard of concussion care, whether the injury occurs on the battlefield or in garrison. The Veterans Administration-DoD Clinical Practice Guidelines (6) were rated as the highest concussion-management guideline in a 2011 edition of Brain Injury (7). Beginning in 2009, the DoD has published numerous TBI clinical recommendations in collaboration with civilian experts in the areas of cognitive rehabilitation, driving assessment, postinjury neurocognitive testing in the deployed environment, management of neuroendocrine dysfunction, assessment and treatment of dizziness, and management of visual dysfunction (8), and an additional three clinical recommendations will be published this year to include graded return to activity, sleep disturbances, and use of neuroimaging. The tests for detecting concussion and tracking recovery are becoming more sensitive, especially when used in combination with other tools to create a multimodal approach to concussion assessment. Despite all that has been accomplished, caring for service members and athletes at risk for sustaining cerebral concussion has always been a challenging task and never more so than in today's litigious society. Concussion is different from other injuries, in that we still rely heavily on an athlete's or a service member's subjective reporting of symptoms for decisionmaking, and we lack the neuroimaging protocols that might allow us to identify the damage and understand its severity. The cause-and-effect relationships, or lack of same, between repetitive head trauma and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) are the subject of significant debate. Several published case reports have described tau deposits in the brains of deceased contact-sport athletes, but most of the neuroscience community does not believe that controlled experimental research has yet identified a causal relationship linking repetitive head trauma in sports and CTE(9–12). Innovative neuroimaging techniques are on the horizon and will eventually permit tau and other proteins to be traced in vivo. This should allow for prospective investigations comparing head-impact exposure with tau accumulation, leading to earlier detection and interventions for these chronic neurodegenerative diseases. In the meantime, our responsibility is to safely care for our service members and athletes, to educate them about what is known and unknown regarding the long-term effects of repetitive head trauma, and to ensure that family members, coaches, and military unit leaders implement supportive recovery practices. Unfortunately, the large amount of misinformation on this topic sometimes results in hysteria rather than rational thinking. Concussions are like snowflakes: no two are alike, and no cookbook or calendar can specify exactly how they should be treated. Therefore, we need to go the extra mile. In many cases, it's a matter of counseling our service members and our athletes about the short- and long-term risks of not reporting symptoms, returning to play or duty while still experiencing symptoms, or not modifying risky behaviors that can predispose them to future concussions. We need individualized and sport-specific return-to-play progressions that ensure that service members and athletes are physically and cognitively prepared to return to activity. No checkbox system can be applied to every concussion, and as concussions are diverse and unique injuries that affect each athlete differently, we must learn how to treat them individually. Likewise, concussed service members and athletes are unique, and we must work to understand what makes them different. Sports medicine clinicians must play the important role of counselor to our athletes. Getting to know each athlete's mindset and reaction to injuries allows us to build trust and forge honest lines of communications, thus enabling us to develop an appropriate and individualized plan for managing concussion, which is just as vital as knowing how to interpret the results of a cognitive or balance test. Within a 6-month period, four major consensus or evidence-based documents focused on concussion management will have been released, including the new “Zurich International Guidelines” or the Consensus Statement on Concussion in Sport: the 4th International Conference on Concussion in Sport (13–16). This, along with other manuscripts published or soon to be published by the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine, the American Academy of Neurology, and the National Athletic Trainers' Association, should all be mandatory reading for sports medicine clinicians, as they will define the standard of care for sports medicine clinicians for at least the next 4–5 years. These documents are well-prepared and will make significant contributions to the sports medicine community. The landscape is changing, and these evidence-based guidelines are leading us in a better direction. Although the neuroscience community has learned much about concussion in the last two decades, we admittedly have much more to investigate and to understand.",

      "abstract": "A drug can be defined as a substance other than food which may affect the constitution or function of a living thing through its chemical properties. In this sense, it may be possible to place organic solvents like bond, gas or thinner and narcotics like marijuana, methamphetamine, cocaine or heroine under the category of drugs. These drugs are characteristic of having positive medicinal as well as side effects upon human being including but not limited to excitement, hallucinatory image, auditory hallucination, relaxation, sleeping, anorexia, nerve stability, schizophrenia, anaesthesia, brain damage, narcissism, etc. Abuse of drugs, however, would result in direct and indirect impact upon the society, family and industry as a whole by ruining of families, unemployment, loss of manpower, and catastrophic damage of physical and mental health of all people. Strong cling to drugs could also cause devastation of personality by abandoning relationship with family members and friends and even jobs, hobbies and culture and would eventually make addicts unsociable. Furthermore, abuse of drugs could be a cause for more serious phenomenon of social pathology such as drastic increase of inhuman violent crimes, crimes without specific motives, frequent burglary and theft to raise the money to buy drugs with. In contrast with the global trend to enforce the regulations for drug-related crimes, the Korean judiciary authorities keep on dealing leniently with offenders, especially when they are first timers, by only charging the fine not exceeding 50 million Won. To put use of drugs under control, it seems more effective to install and operate facilities which are dedicated to providing supports for drug addicts to get free from the cycle of crimes and return to the society. In sum, it would be extremely important to study the measures needed to prevent occurrence of drug-related crimes because the issue of addiction can not　rely on legal punishments alone. The legal system that imposes heavy penalty upon drug-related crimes may be effective to a certain extent in terms of crime prevention but has limit in itself. It is therefore most imperative to respond in a more active way to prevention of drug-related crimes by introducing the educational programs for drug addiction, by training experts who can treat drug addicts, not to speak of working out preventive measures from the perspective of criminal legislation and socio-cultural aspects as well.",

Su evolucion natural sin tratamiento puede derivar en serias repercusiones negativas en el funcionamiento academico, social y familiar de los ninos, interfiriendo de forma importante en el desarrollo. Su identificacion puede ser dificil pues, en ocasiones, son expresiones exageradas o temporalmente inadecuadas de lo que se consideran reacciones normales y adaptativas: el miedo y la ansiedad. Los TA incluyen trastornos de inicio especifico en la infancia y adolescencia (ej. el trastorno de separacion) y otros cuya expresion sindromica es semejante a los TA del adulto (ej. trastorno de panico). Las manifestaciones de los TA son polimorfas y desconcertantes en ocasiones (quejas fisicas variadas, rechazo a ir al colegio, comportamientos de apego excesivo a los padres o a los principales cuidadores, resistencia a ir a dormir, hiperactividad y oposicionismo, etc.). La consulta del pediatra es el lugar idoneo para establecer un diagnostico de presuncion y proceder a la indagacion y posterior confirmacion de aquel. El pediatra debe estar familiarizado con el diagnostico, las herramientas basicas de tratamiento y los procedimientos de derivacion a salud mental. Las principales modalidades de tratamiento en la practica clinica son la terapia cognitivo-comportamental (TCC), las intervenciones informativas para familiares y el tratamiento farmacologico. Aunque se han producido importantes avances en el desarrollo y aplicacion de tratamientos para los TA, aun existe un numero limitado de estudios que prueben la eficacia de los mismos.",

      "abstract": "Headache can affect all aspects of a child's functioning, leading to negative affective states (eg, anxiety, depression, anger) and increased psychosocial problems (for instance, school absences, problematic social interactions). For children and adolescents who experience frequent headache problems, comorbid psychological issues are a well‐recognized, but poorly understood, clinical phenomenon. The confusion surrounding the relationship between pediatric headache and psychopathology exists for several reasons. First, in some cases, headache has been inappropriately attributed to psychological or personality features based on anecdotal observations or interpretations that go beyond the available data. Additionally, measures of psychopathology have not always adhered to the American Psychiatric Association's diagnostic criteria, thus reducing the reliability of diagnostic judgments. Furthermore, the diagnosis of headache has not always followed standard criteria, and has been complicated by the emergence of new terms and evolving measures. Finally, methodological shortcomings, such as incomplete descriptions of the procedures and criteria used for the study, inadequate descriptions of headache severity, lack of a control group for comparison with individuals without headaches, reliance primarily on cross‐sectional research designs that are often discussed with inferences to causal hypotheses, and the use of unstandardized assessment measures, have significantly limited the validity of research findings. The goal of the current review is to examine the extant literature to provide the most up‐to‐date picture on what the research has made available about the magnitude, specificity, and causes of psychopathology in children and adolescents with headache, in an effort to further elucidate their relationship and prompt a more methodologically rigorous study of these issues.",

This is illustrated by the late-antique sources included in the last section of the chapter: Oribasius, Aetius, Alexander of Tralles and Paul of Aegina. The topics analysed include patient profiling and behaviours; the topic of 'neighbouring diseases' and 'similar diseases' to phrenitis (pleuritis and pneumonia, but especially lethargos as cold brain fever, symmetrical to the hot brain fever which is phrenitis); and the recurring symptoms. These form a clear picture by now, featuring fever, sensorial disturbance, cognitive damage, various 'neurological' signs like (notably) 'flocillation' (the compulsive picking of hair or flocks from one's clothes and blankets), sleep disturbance, voice alteration, expectoration, a certain quality of the urine and pulse, respiratory issues, and a rich and varied psychological disturbance, where hallucination stands out.",

      "title": "Novel Potential Antimigraine Compounds: Carotid and Systemic Haemodynamic Effects in a Porcine Model of Migraine",
      "abstract": "textabstractThe term migraine stems from hemicrania, describing a periodic disorder consisting of\nparoxysmal unilateral headache, accompanied by nausea, vomiting, photophobia and/or\nphonophobia. Hemicrania was later changed to Latin words - hemigranea and migranea;\neventually the French cognate, migraine, gained acceptance in the eighteenth century and has\nprevailed ever since. A working definition of migraine is benign recurring headache and/or\nneurological dysfunction usually attended by pain-free interludes and often provoked by\nstereotyped stimuli (1). Migraine may be triggered by certain factors (red wine, menses, hunger,\nlack of sleep, glare, perfumes, periods of let down) and relieved by others (sleep, pregnancy).\nPremonitory symptoms occur hours to a day or two before a migraine attack with or without\naura. Migraine is more common in females, with a hereditary predisposition towards attacks and\nthe cranial circulatory phenomenon appears to be secondary to a primary central nervous system\n(CNS) disorder.\nThe Headache Classification Committee of the International Headache Society (IHS)\npublished the classification and diagnostic criteria for headache disorders in 1988 (Table 1.1) (2).\nThe terms “common migraine” and “classical migraine” have been replaced by “migraine\nwithout aura” and “migraine with aura”, respectively. These operational criteria have been\nvalidated by different approaches and have enabled us to distinguish different headache entities\nin a reliable manner (3-6). In recent years, the IHS criteria have been used world-wide in several\nmulticentre double-blind drug trials, which have shown a reasonably consistent response rate to\ntriptans (7), reflecting a consensus in the defined migraine group. In a recent MAZE survey, the\nMigraine Disability Assessment Scale (MIDAS) questionnaire has been used to assess the impact\nof migraine on work, home and social lives. MIDAS scores confirmed the debilitating effect of\nmigraine; >50% of respondents had a MIDAS grade of III or IV, indicating moderate or severe\ndisability. Less than one-third of patients reported that their current medication was consistently\neffective and only 36% were 'very satisfied' with their current therapy (8). These results show\nthat migraine patients world-wide are still not receiving adequate treatment and a significant\nunmet need in migraine care still remains.",

      "abstract": "Medications with cognitive effects and/or side effects also affect sleep and dreaming. The most common of these cognitive effects is drug-induced sleepiness occurring during waking. Unfortunately, the terminology describing daytime sleepiness, generally considered to be 'the subjective state of sleep need,' is poorly defined, interchangeably including such contextual terminology as sleepiness, drowsiness, languor, inertness, fatigue, and sluggishness.2 Waking consciousness is not a univariate state, changing cyclically during the day from focused alertness, to states characterized by associative thought, drowsiness, and even 'altered' states such as meditation, hallucination, or hypnosis.3 The subjective behavioral complaint of 'sleepiness' often does not accurately reflect the results of tests for physiological sleepiness.4 The effects of sleepiness on daytime performance can be assessed by tests of complex reaction and coordination, or by tests that assess complex behavioral tasks likely to be affected by sleepiness (i.e. tests of driving performance).5 These data have been shown to correlate with epidemiological studies demonstrating that several groups of drugs known to induce daytime sleepiness are associated with increased rates of automobile accidents (e.g. sedating antihistamines, long-acting benzodiazepines, and sedating antidepressants).6,7 Such performance tests have not generally been used for the assessment of daytime performance for a majority of drugs noted to induce sleepiness as a side effect.",

      "abstract": "Stimulants are sympathomimetic substances that include cocaine, amphetamines, and cathinones. Approximately 1% of Americans have used illicit stimulants in the past month, and nearly 25,000 deaths were attributed to stimulant overdose in 2017. Acute effects include tachycardia, elevated blood pressure, and euphoria. High doses of stimulants may lead to cardiac arrhythmias, severe hypertension, agitation, myocardial infarction, aortic dissection, stroke, hyperthermia, or rhabdomyolysis. Abstinence after regular use of stimulants may lead to dysphoria, fatigue, insomnia, and agitation. People who use stimulants may present with acute effects or medical complications. Cocaine metabolites and amphetamines can be detected in urine for a few days after use. The most serious complications of acute use are cardiovascular (especially myocardial infarction and stroke) and psychiatric (agitation and delirium); the risk of hyperthermia is also increased. A number of psychosocial modalities appear to reduce stimulant use among selected individuals, including individual and group counseling, cognitive–behavioral therapy, contingency management, and community reinforcement. No medication has been consistently shown to reduce complications and use of stimulants, although prescription stimulants and topiramate show some promise for treating cocaine use disorder. Syringe exchange programs and safe consumption sites are associated with decreased stimulant use-related complications. Caffeine has mild stimulant effects and may lead to a mild dependence syndrome.",

      "abstract": "Introduction 1.1 Cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease Idiopathic Parkinson`s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by basal ganglia dysfunction frequently being associated with frontostriatal dysfunction and cognitive impairment.The prevalence of PD increases with age and is estimated at 100-200/100000 people (Chen et al., 2001;Schrag et al., 2000) worldwide.The clinical hallmarks of PD are akinesia, rigidity and tremor (Douglas et al., 1999;Hughes et al., 1992).In the past PD has been considered as a pure movement disorder, but in recent years the presence of non-motor symptoms in PD has been recognized.Non-motor symptoms include a variety of autonomic dysfunctions such as orthostatic hypotension, postural tachycardia, bladder dysfunction, sleep disturbances, psychiatric symptoms, i.e. depression, hallucinations or psychosis and cognitive impairment.Non-motor symptoms such as pain, depression or sleep disturbances might precede the onset of motor symptoms in PD and are sometimes even more disabling than motor deficits.For many years cognitive impairment and the occurrence of dementia have been considered as not typical for IPD.James Parkinson (Parkinson, 1817) wrote in his essay on the shaking palsy \" the senses are not disturbed\".However, there is now enough evidence in the literature that dementia might occur in up to 40% of PD-patients (Emre et al., 2004).PD dementia is the third most common reason for dementia.Dementia in PD has been associated with reduced quality of life, greater sensitivity to medication, higher risk of developing psychosis, shortened survival (Levy, 2002), increased caregivers stress and frequent transfer to nursing homes (Aarsland et al., 2000) compared to PD-patients without dementia.In contrast to dementia mild cognitive impairment might occur early in the course of the disease.Approximately, a quarter of PDpatients without dementia have mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) and 20% might have MCI at the time of diagnosis (Aarsland et al., 2011).The cognitive deficits in PD are specific and include executive dysfunction, attentional and visuospatial deficits.Executive functions include control, manipulation, and cognitive flexibility (",

The medical literature presents and promotes red flags to increase the likelihood of identifying a secondary etiology. In this review, we aim to discuss the incidence and prevalence of secondary headaches as well as the data on sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value of red flags for secondary headaches. We review the following red flags: (1) systemic symptoms including fever; (2) neoplasm history; (3) neurologic deficit (including decreased consciousness); (4) sudden or abrupt onset; (5) older age (onset after 65 years); (6) pattern change or recent onset of new headache; (7) positional headache; (8) precipitated by sneezing, coughing, or exercise; (9) papilledema; (10) progressive headache and atypical presentations; (11) pregnancy or puerperium; (12) painful eye with autonomic features; (13) posttraumatic onset of headache; (14) pathology of the immune system such as HIV; (15) painkiller overuse or new drug at onset of headache. Using the systematic SNNOOP10 list to screen new headache patients will presumably increase the likelihood of detecting a secondary cause. The lack of prospective epidemiologic studies on red flags and the low incidence of many secondary headaches leave many questions unanswered and call for large prospective studies. A validated screening tool could reduce unneeded neuroimaging and costs.",

      "title": "Acute dystonic reaction due to a combination of chloroquine and doxycycline in an emergency psychiatry setting",
      "abstract": "Sir, Acute dystonic reactions are extrapyramidal side effects that are seen after the initiation or a rapid increase in the dose of neuroleptic drugs, mainly typical antipsychotics, and have a varied presentation, such as torticollis, trismus, “mouth opening” dystonia, grimacing, dysarthria, oculogyric crisis, blepharospasm, and swallowing difficulties.[1] They frequently present to clinicians in an emergency setting and may sometimes be tricky to handle. Drug-induced movement disorders usually have a clear temporal relationship between medication initiation and symptom onset (some typically occurring with first dose).[1] They are also dose – dependent, and with the exception of tardive syndromes, have a complete resolution after discontinuation of the offending agent.[1] Mechanisms underlying drug-induced movement disorders involve blockade, facilitation, or imbalance of dopamine, serotonin, noradrenaline, and cholinergic neurotransmission in the basal ganglia.[1] Chloroquine is a drug commonly used for the treatment of malaria and has been reported to have gastrointestinal problems, headaches, blurring of vision, and itching as the common side effects.[2] Dystonia induced by chloroquine, although rare, is not really new and is mentioned in patient information leaflets.[2] However, such incidents are rare and mainly have been reported with the first dose. No case reports on acute dystonic reactions with a stable dose of chloroquine or with doxycycline are available. In view of current coronavirus disease pandemic, several combinations of antibiotics and antivirals are being tried and this report necessitates an exercise of caution for possible adverse drug reactions. CASE REPORT A 23-year-old man presented to an emergency psychiatry setting with the complaints of difficulty in lowering his gaze, up-rolling of eyeballs, and difficulty in jaw opening for the last 2 h. On examination, the patient was conscious, cooperative, and oriented. He had difficulty in opening his mouth and lowering his gaze. He appeared to have an acute dystonic reaction presenting with trismus and oculogyric crisis. Other aspects of his general examination were unremarkable. His systemic examination, which included an exhaustive neurological examination, was normal. All baseline investigations, including complete blood counts, serum electrolytes, liver and renal function tests, and random blood glucose, were within normal limits. His resting electrocardiogram was also normal. There was no past history of similar complaints or of any transient ischemic attack, and he had neither a family history of dystonia nor a history of alcohol ingestion, cigarette smoking, or use of illicit drugs or history of taking psychotropic medications. On enquiry, the patient yielded that he had fever for the past 3–4 days, for which he was taking some medications from a physician. All his blood parameters were normal, and he had tested negative for dengue and malaria. However, as it is a common practice in India to empirically start a patient on antibiotics, he had been started on chloroquine (500 mg once daily dosing) and doxycycline (100 mg twice a day). It was after his third dose that he had developed an acute dystonic reaction. Immediately, an injection of promethazine 50 mg was administered intramuscularly. After 15 min, there was some relief in his symptoms. Later on, after giving an injection of intravenous diazepam 5 mg, the patient's symptoms improved considerably. He was kept was observation for 2–3 h and later discharged on oral diazepam 5 mg once daily for 3 days. He was asked to discontinue the antibiotics, and on follow-up, the patient had no further complaints and reported 100% improvement. DISCUSSION Rampant use of antibiotics and their amalgamations has concerning effects such as antimicrobial resistance and higher occurrence of adverse side effects. While most side effects appear nonchalant, there are a few which could be life-threatening, such as acute dystonic reaction. Oculogyric crisis is the only form of acute dystonia that may occur, while the patient is receiving a stable dose of an antipsychotic drug; it may be provoked by alcohol, emotional stress, fatigue, or suggestion.[3] Given the paucity of literature on chloroquine- and doxycycline-induced acute dystonic reactions, we report a case of an acute dystonic reaction presenting as oculogyric crisis with trismus in a patient who was on a stable dose of chloroquine and doxycycline, being empirically treated for fever with a combination of antimalarial and broad-spectrum antibiotic. At a standard dose for malaria treatment, the common adverse effects of chloroquine include gastrointestinal problems, headaches, nightmare, blurring of vision, and itching. Using the Naranjo algorithm, the patient appeared to have probable adverse drug reaction when chloroquine was considered as a cause (score = 6). If doxycycline is considered as a cause alone, the score would be 5 indicating probable adverse drug reactions due to it. The difference of scoring occurs only on the first question of the algorithm as no report mentions dystonia due to doxycycline. This also sheds light on the importance of the first question of the Naranjo algorithm and the need to report such possible adverse reactions. Acute dystonic reactions usually result due to dopamine receptor-2 (D2) blockade in the nigrostriatal pathway, which results in an excess of striatal cholinergic output.[1] The pathophysiological mechanism underlying chloroquine-associated acute dystonic reaction suggests a reduction in the forebrain catecholamine levels and an inhibition of neuronal calcium uptake.[4] Gamma aminobutyric acid has been postulated to play a role in the pathophysiology of acute dystonic reactions, and this is supported by the effectiveness of benzodiazepines in reducing chloroquine-induced acute dystonic reactions.[1] This also explains why our patient improved with diazepam and promethazine had minimal effect on him. There is no available literature on doxycycline-induced acute dystonic reactions, and whether this drug had a contribution in the development of oculogyric crisis in our patient is uncertain. The combination of chloroquine and doxycycline has been shown to be synergistic in the treatment of malaria with increased efficacy of chloroquine on addition of doxycycline.[5] This could perhaps also predispose patients on this combination to develop rare side effects such as dystonia. Doxycycline has been shown to protect dopaminergic neurons and increase levels of dopamine in certain areas of the brain and can theoretically lead to dystonia.[6] Hence, we advocate an index of suspicion for oculogyric crisis whenever these drugs are being prescribed, especially in combination.

      "abstract": "The psychopathology of stroke encompasses several psychiatric and behavioral disorders that have high prevalence in the geriatric population, reduce the patient autonomy and increase the caregiver's burden. These disorders are usually associated with other cognitive and neurological deficits, and are labelled as neuropsychiatric when the whole clinical picture is consistent with the specific dysfunction of a neural system or brain region. Thus the neuropsychiatry of stroke comprises disorders of the perception/identification of the self and the environment (anosognosia of hemiplegia, misidentification syndromes, confabulations, visual hallucinations, delirium and acute confusional state), amotivational syndromes (apathy and athymhormia), disorders of emotional reactivity (blunted affect, emotional incontinence, irritability, catastrophic reactions), poor impulse or ideation control (mania) and personality changes. The clinical profile of the subcortical vascular dementia also points to specific brain dysfunction (frontal-subcortical pathways) that manifests with behavioral (depression, emotionalism, irritability) and cognitive symptoms (psychomotor retardation, attention, executive and memory deficits). However, post-stroke depression and anxiety, which have a more variable clinical presentation and might be assimilated, for several aspects, to post-traumatic or adaptive disorders, are disorders less characterized in their neural correlates.",

      "title": "Persistent Psychosis After a Single Ingestion of “Ecstasy” (MDMA)",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: The street drug “ecstasy” (3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine [MDMA; also “X” or “E”]) is a synthetic amphetamine that has both stimulant and hallucinogenic properties.1 It is increasingly used as a recreational drug and has a strong association with the “rave” culture. Subjective effects of MDMA include elevated mood, increased self-confidence and sensory sensitivity, and a peaceful feeling coupled with insight, empathy, and closeness to persons.2 It has gained a deceptive reputation as a “safe” drug among its users. MDMA use has been associated with various medical complications such as renal and liver failure, rhabdomyolysis, disseminated intravascular coagulation, hepatitis, cerebral infarction, seizures, delirium, fulminant hyperthermia, intracranial bleed, cerebral edema, and coma.3–6 Adverse psychiatric symptomatology associated with MDMA includes panic attack, depression, suicidal ideation, flashbacks, rage reactions, psychosis, and severe paranoia.3 Persistent psychosis after even a single use has been reported.1,4,7 This case report describes persistent psychosis in a previously healthy adolescent girl after a single ingestion of MDMA\r\n\r\nCase report. In October 2010, Ms A, a 17-year-old African American girl without previous psychiatric or medical history, obtained MDMA from her friend and ingested the pill. She began experiencing auditory hallucinations and displaying disorganized speech and behavior shortly thereafter. She was taken to the University of South Alabama, Mobile, emergency department for evaluation and treatment of her behavior. In the emergency department, the consultation-liaison psychiatrist noticed that the patient was awake and alert, but could not engage in meaningful communication. Results of routine laboratory testing showed no alcohol or illicit drugs present. Physical examination findings were unremarkable. She was seen by the neurology service, where physicians believed that the patient had no obvious etiology for her current symptomatology. There was no family history of mood disorders or psychosis among first- or second-degree relatives. The patient was cleared medically in the emergency department and was then transferred to an acute care inpatient psychiatric unit affiliated with the University of South Alabama.\r\n\r\nIn the psychiatric unit, she continued to demonstrate odd, bizarre behavior. She exhibited frequent episodes of crying and using profanity. She displayed sexually inappropriate behavior, eg, touching others sexually, dancing seductively, and assuming unusual postures by putting her hands underneath her pelvis while pushing the pelvis upwards. In addition, she attempted to eat food from another person's plate and multiple trash cans. Her speech was mostly nonsensical, and at times she claimed that she was pregnant and had an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) infection. She appeared to be responding strongly to internal stimuli. She gave the appearance of being paranoid, feeling scared, and being socially withdrawn.\r\n\r\nAfter a literature review, we decided to institute olanzapine orally disintegrating tablets 10 mg every 12 hours. Haloperidol 5 mg and lorazepam 1 mg were also employed on an as-needed basis and were administered frequently over several days. After 14 days of this medication regimen, normal behavior was noticed, but there were intervals during which she became agitated and confused. After that point, her family had decided to take her home against medical advice. She was sent to school for a day by family to resume a normal life (she is an honor roll student and had been accepted to college on a scholarship). According to the family, the school personnel advised her to go back home immediately because “she is not normal.” She was promptly rehospitalized in our care due to frequent agitation, confusion, leaving the house at night, and walking in traffic.\r\n\r\nIn the unit, her assessment demonstrated her to be staring off blankly into space and making repetitive hand, eye, and head movements while screaming. She was placed on 1:1 observation due to her unpredictable behavior. Olanzapine was increased to 15 mg every 12 hours. Gradually, her behavior improved, such that she was no longer displaying stereotypic behavior. She was capable of having meaningful conversations. Furthermore, her reality testing improved. Upon discharge, she showed improvement of symptoms and organized thoughts. However, she continued to describe dysphoric mood. She recounted use of MDMA in October. Instantaneously she noticed she was not herself nor did she recall what happened immediately after taking MDMA.\r\n\r\nMDMA-induced psychotic disorder can be distinguished from schizophrenia by several characteristics associated with the former, including complete lack of prodromal symptoms (social withdrawal, anxiety, or lack of motivation), absence of sustained mood disturbance, and good premorbid functioning.1 The cause of MDMA-induced psychotic symptoms is not well understood.1 Evidence from animal and human studies suggests that MDMA reduces levels of brain serotonergic activity and depletes serotonin stores.8 MDMA acts by binding to presynaptic monoamine transporters, most strongly to the serotonin receptor transporter, causing rapid release and subsequent depletion of serotonin and dopamine from presynaptic terminals.6,9–11 Further damage is caused by the generation of free radicals that are taken by the serotonin nerve terminal, exhausting the antioxidant capacity of brain tissues.12 In laboratory animals, MDMA causes persistent damage to serotonergic neurons.6,9,12 It is thought that it causes similar damage to neurons in the human brain. MDMA does not have a potent direct agonist effect on dopamine receptors.1,2 MDMA may induce psychosis through dopaminergic or serotonergic pathways.13 Our patient did not have medical complications, as compared to a published case report.14 In our case, there was no laboratory toxicology evidence of MDMA exposure; however, routine toxicology screens do not screen for MDMA. Furthermore, presumptive diagnosis of MDMA use is often made without toxicologic evidence. In our patient, we were able to support MDMA use through patient interview and collateral from friends and family. The use of high-dose antipsychotic medication (haloperidol and olanzapine) and anticonvulsants (diazepam and carbamazepine) has been documented for the treatment of psychosis after MDMA use.1,5,6,15\r\n\r\nThe widespread use of MDMA and the potential adverse effects associated with it underlines the need for clinicians to inquire carefully about MDMA use and to include MDMA in toxicology screenings. MDMA use as a differential diagnosis in patients presenting with paranoid psychosis, affective disorders, or anxiety has become increasingly important. When MDMA exposure is suspected, there should be close collaboration between the psychiatrist and medical personnel, since MDMA use is associated with serious medical complications. Whether these complications are due to MDMA use directly or caused by unrelated adulterants added during manufacturing is an area of ongoing research. Further studies are required to clarify the etiology of persistent psychosis after MDMA use and to describe the treatment options.",

Certains d’entre eux comme les apnées du sommeil peuvent engendrer des syndromes tels la dépression, la fatigue, l’impuissance ou des déclins cognitifs allant jusqu’à la démence ou en constituer des facteurs de résistance au traitement ; de la même façon, le dépistage du syndrome des mouvements périodiques des membres inférieurs au cours du sommeil souvent associé au syndrome des jambes sans repos pendant l’éveil, peut permettre une meilleure approche de certaines formes de fatigue chronique, de dépression, de syndromes de glissement. D’autres perturbations au cours du sommeil constituent les symptômes clefs d’un syndrome psychiatrique comme par exemple l’hypersomnie dans la dépression saisonnière ou la dépression atypique. Enfin, certains troubles du sommeil chroniques telle l’insomnie au cours de la troisième décennie de la vie sont souvent les signes précurseurs d’une dépression qui surviendra vingt ans plus tard comme s’il existait un facteur commun à l’origine des deux entités pathologiques. De la même manière, une période d’insomnie même brève s’avère un prédicteur d’une rechute maniaque ou d’un épisode psychotique aigu. Apprendre à les reconnaître, les évaluer, s’en servir comme guides cliniques s’avère essentiel dans la prise en charge des patients de notre spécialité : dans quels cas faut-il systématiquement ou éventuellement demander un enregistrement polygraphique de sommeil ? Existent-t-ils et quelle est la valeur des outils diagnostiques moins contraignants comme par exemple l’agenda de sommeil, l’actimétrie ? Comment prendre en charge une insomnie dans un cadre psychiatrique ? Quel est le « bon usage » des hypnotiques ?

      "abstract": "ion®Tablets lt r iazolamJ € INDICATIONS AND USAGE: HALCION Tablets are indicated in the short-term management of insomnia characterized by difficulty in falling asleep, frequent nocturnal awakenings, and/ or early morning awakenings.It is recommended that HALCION not be prescribed in quantities exceeding a one-month supply.CONTRAINDICATIONS: Patients with known hypersensitivity to this drug or other benzodiazepines.HALCION is contraindicated in pregnant women due to&otential fetal damage.Patients likely to become pregnant while receiving HALCI N should be warned of the potential risk to the fetus.WARNINGS: Overdosage may occur at four times the maximum recommended therapeutic dose.Patients should be cautioned not to exceed prescribed dosage.Because of its depressant CNS effects, patients should be cautioned against engaging in hazardous occupations requiring complete mental alertness and also about the simultaneous ingestion of alcohol and other CNS depressant drugs.Anterograde amnesia and paradoxical reactions have been reported with HALCION and some other benzodiazepines.PRECAUTIONS: General: In elderly and/ or debilitated patients, treatment should be initiated at 0.125 mg to decrease the possibility of development of oversedation, dizziness, or impaired coordination.Caution should be exercised in patients with signs or symptoms of depression which could be intensified by hypnotic drugs.Suicidal tendencies and intentional overdosage is more common in these patients.The usual precautions should be observed in patients with impaired renal or hepatic function and chronic pulmonary insufficiency.Information for Patients: Alert patients about: (a) consumption of alcohol and drugs, (b) possible fetal abnormalities, (c) operating machinery or driving, (d) not increasing prescribed dosage, (e) possible worsening of sleep after discontinuing HALCION.Laboratory Tests: Not ordmarily required in otherwise healthy patients.Drug Interactions: Additive CNS depressant effects with other psychotropics, anticonvulsants, antihistaminics, ethanol, and other CNS depressants.Pharmacokinetic interactions of benzodiazepines with other drugs have been reported.Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility: No evidence of carcinogenic potential was observed in mice during a 24-month study with HALCION in doses up to 4000 times the human dose.Pregnancy: Benzodiazepines may cause fetal damage if administered during pregnancy.The child born of a mother who is on benzodiazepines may be at some risk for withdrawal symptoms and neonatal flaccidity during the postnatal period.Nursing Mothers: Administration to nursing mothers is not recommended.Pediatric Use: Safety and efficacy in children below the age of 18 have not been established.ADVERSE REACTIONS: During placebo-controlled clinical studies in which 1003 patients received HALCION Tablets, the most troublesome side effects were extensions of the pharmacologic activity of HALCION, e.g.drowsiness, dizziness, or lightheadedness.HALCION Placebo Number of Patients 1003 997 % of Patients Reporting: Central Nervous System Drowsiness 14.0 6.4 Headache 9. 7 8.4 Dizziness 7.8 3.1 Nervousness 5.2 4.5 Lightheadedness 4.9 0.9 Coordination Disorder/ Ataxia 4.6 0.8 Gastrointestinal NauseaMmiting 4.6 3.7In addition, the following adverse events have been reported less frequently (i.e., 0.9-0.5%):euphoria, tachycardia, tiredness, confusional states/ memory impairment, cramps/ pain, depression, visual disturbances.Rare (i.e., less than 0.5%) adverse reactions included constipation, taste alterations, diarrhea, dry mouth, dermatitis/allergy, dreaming/ nightmares, insomnia, paresthesia, tinnitus, dysesthesia, weakness, congestion, death from hepatic failure in a patient also receiving diuretic drugs.The following adverse events have been reported in association with the use of benzodiazepines: dystonia, irritability, anorexia, fatigue, sedation, slurred speech, jaundice, pruritus, dysarthria, changes in libido, menstrual irregularities, incontinence and urinary retention.As with all benzodiazepines, paradoxical reactions such as stimulation, agitation, increased muscle spasticity, sleep disturbances, hallucinations and other adverse behavioral effects may occur rarely and in a random fashion.Should these occur, use of the drug should be discontinued.No laboratory changes were considered to be of physiological significance.When treatment is protracted, periodic blood counts, urinalysis and blood chemistry analyses are advisable.Minor changes in EEG&anerns, usually low-voltage fast activity have been observed in patients during HALCI N therapy and are of no known significance.DRUG ABUSE AND DEPENDENCE: Controlled Substance: HALCION Tablets are a Controlled Substance in Schedule IV.Abuse and Dependence: Withdrawal symptoms have occurred following abrupt discontinuance of benzodiazepines.Patients with a history of seizures are at particular risk.Addiction-prone patients should be closely monitored.Repeat prescriptions should be limited to those under medical supervision.OVERDOSAGE: Because of the potency of triazolam, overdosage may occur at 2 mg, four times the maximum recommended therapeutic dose (0.5 mg).Manifestations of overdosage include somnolence, confusion, impaired coordination, slurred speech, and ultimately, coma.Respiration, pulse, and blood pressure should be monitored and supported by general measures when necessary.Immediate gastric lavage should be performed.Multiple agents may have been in~ested.Store at controlled room temperature 15°-30 C (59°•86°F).Caution: Federal law prohibits dispensing without prescription.",

The most common of these are general somatic or gastrointestinal distress, anxiety and agitation, sleep disturbance, akathisia, parkinsonism, paradoxical behavioral activation and mania. There are very few reports of withdrawal reactions following discontinuation of clomipramine since it has not been in use in the US until recently. 2 patients with withdrawal symptoms following discontinuation of clomipramine are presented. A 45-year-old man had general somatic symptoms, including headache, myalgia, weakness, fatigue (flu-like syndrome) and nervousness and insomnia after clomipramine, 75 mg/d, had been discontinued abruptly. All symptoms disappeared without treatment after 3 days. A 47-year-old woman presented mainly with severe insomnia, anxiety, agitation, jitteriness and tension after discontinuing a low dose of 25 mg/d of clomipramine. Symptoms disappeared after she started self-treatment with 50 mg/d of the drug. It is important to differentiate withdrawal symptoms from relapse of the primary psychiatric disorder.",

      "abstract": "Excessive somnolence can be a consequence of lifestyle, environmental and circadian influences, medical disorders, drugs or substances. Disorders of excessive somnolence include insufficient sleep, narcolepsy, idiopathic hypersomnia, recurrent hypersomnia and hypersomnia associated with neurological disorders, psychiatric disorders and internal disorders. This chapter focuses on hypersomnias of central origin and arising from insufficient sleep. It describes epidemiology, pathophysiology, diagnosis, and therapeutic options for each of the excessive somnolence disorder. Hypersomnia may be caused by an underlying medical or neurological disease. Secondary hypersomnias described in the chapter include Parkinson's disease, genetic disorders, endocrine disorders and psychiatric disorders. Multiple chemical substances, especially organic solvents with chronic exposure, may cause hypersomnia. Pancreatic, adrenal or renal insufficiency, and hepatic encephalopathy are other causes. Hypersomnia may occur as a side effect of many drugs, due either to the soporific effects of the drug or to the effect of the drug on reducing night-time sleep.",

      "title": "Serotonin Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Serotonin syndrome presents with neuromuscular, autonomic, and mental status changes. Severe cases of serotonin syndrome, also called serotonin toxicity, are characterized by neuromuscular excitation (clonus, hyperreflexia, myoclonus, rigidity, tremor), autonomic stimulation (hyperthermia, tachycardia, tachypnea, diaphoresis, flushing), and altered mental state (anxiety, agitation, confusion). These more severe cases may come to the clinician's attention on an emergency basis. The diagnosis of serotonin syndrome should be considered in a patient presenting with any combination of clonus, myoclonus, rigidity, and/or tremor. Serotonin syndrome is associated with the use of one or more serotonergic agents. Severe cases generally occur with combinations of serotonergic drugs, most commonly including a serotonin reuptake inhibitor and a monoamine oxidase inhibitor. Excessive serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) in the central nervous system has been implicated. Certain patient populations may be predisposed to developing serotonin toxicity, based on their use of various medications or other substances with serotonergic properties. When evaluating a patient with clinical features of neuromuscular excitation, autonomic stimulation, and/or altered mental state, prompt identification and management are critical, and treatment considerations are often complex.",

      "title": "Editorial (Thematic Issue: Sleep and Psychiatry)",
      "abstract": "Disturbances of the sleep-wake pattern constitute one of the major complaints of patients with a wide range of psychiatric conditions, including major depression disorder, anxiety disorders, bipolar disorders, schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder, eating disorders, and alcohol abuse. Recent advances have cast light on the mecanisms underlying modifications in sleep in psychiatric disorders, offering new approaches in management and opening new avenues of research. Isnomnia and psychiatric disorders, especially depression, are intimately linked. Insomnia, defined as a difficulty in initiating and/or in maintaining sleep leading to daytime repercussions, is not simply a symptom of depression but an independent diagnostic entity, and is known to be an independent risk factor for both depression itself and the development of a new depression episode or relapse. To date, the psychological and neurobiological mechanisms underlying the relationships between insomnia and affective disorders are not yet fully understood. The review by Chiara Baglioni et al. examines the latest findings from several fields of research, with particular attention to alterations of the arousal system leading to hyperarousal and to the possible biological mechanisms involved in the link between sleep alteration, insomnia, regulation of emotion, and mood symptoms. Links between depression sleep and circadian rhythms have long been suspected due to the existence of seasonal depression, where the onset of low mood correlates with a reduction in day length. Seasonal affective disorder (SA) is primarily a circadian rhythm disorder. Alfred Lewy discusses the theory of misalignement between the circadian rhythm of melatonin secretion and the midpoint of the sleep bout, and emphasise the importance or careful timing of treatment administration (bright light or melatonin). Timing of treatment administration requiring detailed information on patients’ phase state and the role of new accessible tools such as dim light melatonine onset are evaluated as are different treatment modalities. The importance of biological rhythms in SA disorder has led to an interest in the role of circadian rhythms in the development of depression. The successes of chronobiotic treatments for SA disorder have led to the trialling of psychological and pharmacological treatments targeting circadian rhythms in unipolar major depression (MDD). The review by Sarah Hartley et al. focuses on the research linking circadian rhythms and depression, and on the evidence for effectiveness of chronobiotic treatments such as high intensity light, melatonin or melatonin agonist or behavioural therapy in MDD. The evidence base for novel antidepressants combining 5HT2c antagonist and melatonin agonist action in acute treatment of unipolar MDD and in relapse prevention is reviewed as is their use in clinical management of MDD. Managing bipolar disorder is a challenge for psychiatrists and it has been long known that sleep disorders are a sign of relapse. Carole Boudebesse et al. examine the evidence that sleep and circadian rhythms are disturbed in bipolar patients during both mood episodes and periods of remission. Therapeutic applications of chronobiology in bipolar disorder, such as specific psychosocial interventions, light therapy and physical exercise are described. Finally, psychiatrists are faced with frequent reports of sleep disorders in adults and children with attentiondeficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and, conversely, sleep specialists report certain symptoms of ADHD (attention deficits, fidgeting) in patients suffering from primary sleep disorders. Are ADHD symptoms secondary to sleep fragmentation due to sleep disorders such as sleep disordered breathing and periodic legs movements, and treatable with treatment of these specific disorders? Could some ADHD subjects share a common deficit in the sleep/wake regulation systems resulting in sleep fragmentation? The pathophysiological relationship between sleep disorders and ADHD is complex and probably multidirectional. The hot topic from the team of Astrid Claret et al. reviews the latest research and aims to help clinicians in developing a framework for understanding and treating patients suffering from ADHD and sleep disorders.",

Psychopathologische Analysen sowie klinische Erfahrungen zeigen, dass es sich beim pathologischen Spielen um eine weit über eine Impulskontrollstörung hinausreichende Erkrankung handelt; viele der an ihr leidenden Menschen weisen alle Zeichen einer Abhängigkeitsstörung auf. Es wird daher vorgeschlagen das pathologische Spielen und Wetten in den ICD–11 den Abhängigkeitserkrankungen zuzuordnen und nach folgenden Kriterien zu diagnostizieren: 1. Ein starker Wunsch oder eine Art Zwang zu spielen bzw. zu wetten. 2. Verminderte Kontrollfähigkeit bezüglich des Beginns, der Beendigung und der Dauer des Spielens bzw. Wettens. 3. Auftreten eines Entzugssyndroms bei Beendigung oder Reduktion des Spielens bzw. Wettens, nachgewiesen durch suchtspezifische Entzugssymptome oder durch die Aufnahme der gleichen oder einer nahe verwandten Tätigkeit, um Entzugssymptome zu mildern oder zu vermeiden. 4. Nachweis einer Toleranz. um die ursprünglich durch niedrige Dosen erreichten Wirkungen des Spielens bzw. Wettens hervorzurufen, sind zunehmend höhere Dosen erforderlich (ein Beispiel hierfür sind die steigenden „Tagesdosen“ von Spielern, die bei Konsumenten ohne Toleranzentwicklung schon zu einem Aufhören wegen schwerer Beeinträchtigungen, wie z.B. psycho-soziale, finanzielle oder Beziehungsprobleme, führen würden). 5. Vernachlässigung von Interessen zugunsten des Spielens, erhöhter Zeitaufwand, um zu spielen bzw. zu wetten, bzw. entsprechende finanzielle Mittel zu beschaffen, oder sich von den Folgen zu erholen. 6.

What the authors observed was the same spectrum of psychic symptoms repeatedly reported from withdrawal reactions to alcohol or other sedativehypnotic drugs. \"Acute brain syndrome due to drug withdrawal\" is a much more precise phrase. Psychotic symptoms have not been prominent in the relatively few withdrawal reactions to benzodiazepines reported in the medical literature since our first experimental study (<i>Psychopharmacologia</i>2:63-68, 1961). These reactions are modified in severity and attenuated over time because of the long persistence of the drug and its active metabolites in the body. Withdrawal reactions are dependent on high dosage of drug sustained rather constantly over time, with rapid rate of disappearance of the drug when it is discontinued.

      "abstract": "In the older population, one of the serious health concerns that are associated with comorbidity, impaired functioning, excessive use of health care resources, and increased mortality (including suicide) is a depressive disorder. Depression that occurs among individuals greater than or equal to 65 years with no previous history of depression is known as late-life depression, which is characterized as the affective state of sadness that occurs as a response to various of human situations including loss of a loved one, failing to achieve goals, or disappointment in love relationships. Major depression differs only in the intensity and duration or quality of the emotional state. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) defines major depressive disorder by the presence of depressed mood or a marked loss of interest or pleasure in activities along with 5 or more of the following associated symptoms: changes in appetite or weight (5% of the total body weight), sleep, energy, concentration, and psychomotor activity, feelings of inappropriate guilt or worthlessness and recurrent thoughts of death or suicide. There should be an impairment in social, occupational, and other areas of functioning.The symptoms of depression should have been present during the last two weeks. Depression in late-life is underdiagnosed and inadequately treated. It is a serious and life-threatening disorder which affects every 1 in 5 individual in a lifetime. When it occurs in old age, it becomes challenging to distinguish it from dementia, as both these diagnoses have overlapping symptom profiles, especially when depression affects the cognition and is presented as ’pseudodementia.’",

      "abstract": "Serotonin syndrome (SS) (also referred to as serotonin toxicity) is a potentially life-threatening drug-induced toxidrome associated with increased serotonergic activity in both the peripheral (PNS) and central nervous systems (CNS). It is characterised by a dose-relevant spectrum of clinical findings related to the level of free serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]), or 5-HT receptor activation (predominantly the 5-HT 1A and 5-HT 2A subtypes), which include neuromuscular abnormalities, autonomic hyperactivity, and mental state changes. Severe SS is only usually precipitated by the simultaneous initiation of 2 or more serotonergic drugs, but the syndrome can also occur after the initiation of a single serotonergic drug in a susceptible individual, the addition of a second or third agent to long-standing doses of a maintenance serotonergic drug, or after an overdose. The combination of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), in particular MAO-A inhibitors that preferentially inhibit the metabolism of 5-HT, with serotonergic drugs is especially dangerous, and may lead to the most severe form of the syndrome, and occasionally death. This review describes our current understanding of the pathophysiology, clinical presentation and management of SS, and summarises some of the drugs and interactions that may precipitate the condition. We also discuss the newer novel psychoactive substances (NPSs), a growing public health concern due to their increased availability and use, and their potential risk to evoke the syndrome. Finally, we discuss whether the inhibition of tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), in particular the neuronal isoform (TPH2), may provide an opportunity to pharmacologically target central 5-HT synthesis, and so develop new treatments for severe, life-threatening SS.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is defined as difficulty falling or remaining asleep with associated daytime consequences. It is among the most common clinical complaints in the general adult population. The prevalence is significantly higher in people with psychiatric disorders. Insomnia in psychiatric patients may be affected by particular disorders, the illness severity, and the treatment approaches. Mood and anxiety disorders are especially likely to be comorbid with insomnia; however, many other psychiatric disorders increase the probability of sleep disturbances. Insomnia frequently is the first symptom heralding an episode of depression, and it may continue as a residual symptom following the resolution of the mood disturbance. Many different sedating substances and medications have been used with the intention of improving sleep. The insomnia treatment medications currently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration comprise a variety of benzodiazepine receptor agonist hypnotics and a single selective melatonin receptor agonist. The prescribing guidelines of the recently approved medications have no implied limitation on their duration of use and specify whether they are indicated for sleep onset and maintenance. There are significant safety concerns or inadequate efficacy evidence for the treatment of insomnia with many alternative pharmacologic strategies, including herbal preparations, over-the-counter antihistamines, and the off-label use of antidepressants and antipsychotics. Advances in understanding the regulation of the sleep–wake cycle now are leading to new pharmacologic targets to treat insomnia and related sleep disorders.",

      "abstract": "Although the efficacy of chlorpromazine and other phenothiazine derivatives in the treatment of schizophrenic psychotic reactions has been established for almost a decade, there remain differences of opinion regarding which symptoms and behaviours are affected favourably by psychopharmacologic treatment. By and large, the phenothiazines have been characterized as “ataractics” or “tranquillizers”, the implication being that their predominant action is to calm excited patients by relieving the patient's anxiety or other forms of psychic distress. However, clinical experience increasingly asserts that the phenothiazines influence many manifestations of schizophrenic patients other than anxiety and excitement, including symptoms such as incoherent thought and apathy.",

There are similar expressions of distress that have a different outcome. They are construed as an emotional outpouring of no medical significance. Doctors only become involved if the believer, or significant others, think the person might be sick. Who is responsible for what then ensues deserves discussion since about one in five of those offering a history of “seizures” to neurology outpatients only think they have them. A false belief about seizuring (aka Hysterical Epilepsy and/or Pseudoseizures) does not differ in any significant way nor have interestingly different psychological antecedents from any other false beliefs about being diseased (Medically Relevant Hysteria). But what there is to ‘treat’ is not the fit but the belief; and the most important believer may not be the person with the odd behavior. In the case of pseudoseizures, that believer’s concern is innocent. (See also Outlandish Factitious Illness in this volume) Belief is an assent to a proposition whose primary attributes are its truth or falsity. Beliefs can become convictions and so persist and look to convert others to that belief. Knowledge however requires the attainment of certain facts as a result of a",

Parece ser que hay una dimension en desarrollo en la localizacion del espacio y la modalidad de las alucinaciones. Las alucinaciones rara vez ocurren en los ninos con trastornos emocionales y de la conducta y esos ninos no son tan distintos de otros ninos con diagnosticos similares, ni tienen tampoco una peor prognosis. Pero hay algunas caracteristicas confusas e interesantes en su presentacion clinica. Hay indicadores de que hay alguna relacion entre las alucinaciones y las reacciones psiquiatricas de desconsuelo y parece ser que algunos individuos tienen una predisposicion especial a alucinar. Parecen tener una labilidad especial en los sistemas que mantienen los niveles adecuados de conciencia, y esto, asociado con los cambios de humor, los puede llevar a experimentar alucinaciones en estado de vigilia.

It may also happen that the presence of a chronic disease changes the social situation of a patient, who then responds to the change by developing depression. Among the various systemic diseases, endocrine diseases, viral infections, collagen disease, pancreatic cancer, vitamin B12 deficiency, and folic acid deficiency are particularly likely to cause depression. Drugs, including interferon, methyldopa, and steroids, may also be the cause of depression. The depression seen in organic brain disease (secondary depres- sion) includes depression in convalescence from disturbance of consciousness caused by head trauma or encephalitis, poststroke depression, and depression in Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, or other neurodegenerative diseases. The symptoms of depression associated with a medical condition are basically the same as those in endogenous depression, including depressed mood, sadness, diminished mental activity, and impatience. However, depression associated with chronic organic brain disorders is characterized by the predominant symptoms of diminished intellectual capacity, apathetic tendency, lability of mood, retardation in thinking and speech, and flat affect, whereas depressive mood, insomnia, anorexia, low self- esteem, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and suicidal ideation are mild.",

      "abstract": "Mental illness can arise from over-compensation of neural processes when they attempt to correct nervous system perturbation, regardless of the original cause. Initial brain compromise can be caused by genes, toxins, chemicals, infective agents, hypoxia or trauma. The original insult leads to a compensatory process of ‘rendering the synapse supersensitive’, a general neural mechanism that is involved in nervous system adaptation, repair, and regeneration. For example, in psychoses, the many and diverse early risk factors that underlie the psychosis converge to increase the number of supersensitive dopamine D2 receptors (i.e., D2 receptors that are in the high-affinity state for dopamine). Supersensitivity of synapses compensates for and protects the brain from further injury. This leads to heightened neurotransmission, which is experienced subjectively as overstimulation, with subsequent attempts to psychologically adapt. Out of individual attempts at compensation, arise the signs and symptoms that have been identified with schizophrenia and other psychoses.",

Abuse of a medication refers to excessive use of a drug to achieve a “high,” which may result in addiction to the medication and which causes dysfunction in a patient's life. However, misuse refers to usage of a medication without a prescription or for reasons other than that which it was prescribed. Diversion refers to the diverting of legally prescribed medication into illegal use by other than the patient. Sahakian and Morein-Zamir recently discussed the use of cognitive-enhancing drugs by individuals with a variety of disorders as well as off-label and non-prescription use by the general public. In addition to inappropriate use of medications, patients with ADHD often turn to other substances that are detrimental to their health, such as nicotine.",

Case examples illustrate how these may present. Diabetes can cause confusion due to either hyper- or hypoglycemia. Congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive lung disease can cause hypoxia and resulting confusion. Sleep apnea can present with amnesia, apathy, and depression. Physiological changes make elderly patients especially susceptible to adverse drug effects, including hyponatremia and anticholinergic symptoms. Depression and cognitive changes have been associated with both hyper- and hypothyroidism, as well as with hyperparathyroidism. Elderly patients are at risk for developing subdural hematomas which can present with cognitive deficits and blunting of mood, and some patients may not have taken notice of the traumatic incident. Vitamin B12 deficiency can present with neurological symptoms including dementia, and cancer may present with fatigue and weight loss, which may be interpreted as depression.",

Neuropsychological assessments revealed deficits on visual processing tasks. Neuroimaging, electroencephalography and ophthalmological evaluation revealed no abnormalities. The multimodal sensory distortions responded to antipsychotic treatment, paralleling improvement in other schizophrenia psychopathology, over a period of one month.Prominent and persistent multimodal sensory distortions like metamorphopsia and paracousis in the presence of psychotic symptoms warrant a detailed neurological and general medical work-up.

In a typical scenario, a perpetrator adds a date-rape drug which has sedative effect into alcoholic or non-alcoholic beverage of an unsuspecting person. After drug administration, mostly amnesia and symptoms such as confussion, loss of memory, lack of muscle control, dizziness occur. The main drugs in sexual assaults are benzodiazepines such as γ-hydroxy butyrate and its analogs, clonazepam, alprazolam, flunitrazepam, oxazepam, ketamine, barbiturates, antidepressants, cocaine and stimulants. Most of these drugs are colorless, odorless and highly soluble in alcohol or other beverages quickly. They are rapidly absorbed and eliminated after oral administration. A victim may complain to police or other legal forces after several days due to emotional trauma as shame, fear, doubt and disbelief. For this reason, It is important to know what time the sample is taken from the victim to confirm the presence of the drug. In this study, we will present a general approach to date-rape drugs used in sexual assault.",

      "abstract": "Movement disorders are a group of neurological disorders often without an identifiable etiology or manifestations of genetic or neurodegenerative disorders. Classical examples include idiopathic Parkinson’s disease, essential tremor, various forms of dystonia, chorea, myoclonus, tics, and other hypokinetic and hyperkinetic movement disorders. These and other movement disorders may also occur as presenting or prominent features of general neurological disorders such as stroke, encephalitis, multiple sclerosis, or CNS tumors. Moreover, they may also occur in the setting of a wide spectrum of systemic diseases, including metabolic and endocrine disorders, intoxications, hematological diseases, cancer, or infection. These latter situations where movement disorders are the hallmark of general neurologic or systemic conditions is when clinicians may face challenges of diagnosis and treatment. Affected patients may present to the internists and other physicians, including neurologists not skilled in movement disorders, who may be unfamiliar with the phenomenology or differential diagnosis.",

Many psychotropic compounds exhibit short durations of action, making repeated daily administration necessary. Patients discontinue their medication, with frequent relapses and rehospitalizations for many reasons, including the sense of wellbeing, fear, neglect, lack of insight, poor judgment, delusions, disturbed communication, miscalculation of visits, or expense.<sup>1</sup>In contrast to the physically ill who maintain treatment because they suffer from their symptoms, psychiatric patients, particularly schizophrenics, may have no such reminder. In the follow-up of one of our recent studies,<sup>2</sup>one-fourth of the discharged patients were rehospitalized with active psychotic symptoms within four to eight weeks of a self-induced drug free period. To avoid discontinuation of medication, recurrence of psychosis, and rehospitalization, a longer acting psychotropic compound was needed, similar to depot insulin used in diabetes, and the development of such a compound among the phenothiazines was encouraged.",

Other monosymptomatic disorders are often referred to as essential tremor variants. Recent findings There is now solid evidence that essential tremor, however defined, is a syndrome with multiple causes. Summary A new tremor classification scheme is being developed by the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society Task Force on Tremor. In this scheme, tremor in the absence of other neurological signs is called isolated tremor, and tremor in combination with other signs is called combined tremor. Many isolated and combined tremor syndromes can be defined on the basis of commonly recurring or unique clinical symptoms and signs, including historical features (age at onset, family history, and temporal evolution) and tremor characteristics (body distribution, activation condition, associated features). Essential tremor, however defined, is simply a syndrome and not a specific disease. Essential tremor should be defined and used consistently, or this term should be abandoned. As essential tremor is an arbitrarily defined syndrome, it makes no sense to refer to other tremors as variants of essential tremor or essential tremor syndromes.",

Symptoms include weight loss with loss of pleasure, sleep changes (i.e. insomnia or hypersomnia), psychomotor agitation or regression, fatigue or loss of energy, feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt, reduced ability to think or concentrate, and recurrent thoughts of death. Basically, treatment consists of pharmacological and psychological interventions. Although these treatments are effective, not all patients achieve the same results. In this case, alternative approaches are needed to prevent and treat depression. Our literature review shows that high levels of physical activity and exercise have protective effects on depression cases. In combination with other treatment modalities, exercise and physical activity may lead to a more rapid improvement of the clinical picture. In this article, we reviewed the current literature on the use of physical activity and exercise for the prevention and treatment of depression.",

      "title": "New psychoactive substances—Synthetic stimulants",
      "abstract": "The expression “New Synthetic Stimulants” include classes of psychoactive compounds that share subjective effects in humans such as boosted mood or euphoria, feelings of empathy or compassion, increased sociability and sex drive, perceived increased ability to learn and focus, increased energy and alertness, with unpleasant outcomes like increased blood pressure and heart rate, paranoia or aberrations, decreased appetite, raised body temperature, clenched jaw or grinding teeth, dry mouth, insomnia, hallucinations, and aggressive or violent behavior. Synthetic stimulants act in the brain by increasing concentrations of neurotransmitters, mainly dopamine and serotonin. Dopamine is involved in attention, reward, and motivation whereas serotonin is involved in generating feelings of happiness and pleasure. Synthetic stimulants act on the two brain systems to different extents, accounting for their range of effects. Noradrenaline release is also stimulated by these compounds, but to a minor degree. In any case, long‐term use of synthetic stimulants exhausts dopamine and serotonin systems in the brain. The nerve cells become desensitized to the drugs, which makes them resistant to the brain's own signaling molecules. This leads to tolerance and dependence, which can easily turn into addiction. Like classic stimulants (e.g., cocaine, methamphetamine), new synthetic stimulants can be highly addictive. This article is categorized under: Toxicology &gt; New Psychoactive Substances",

      "abstract": "Disease with Lewy bodies or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), particularly at the prodromal stage, is a complex disease to diagnose because of different clinical beginnings and variable paths in terms of clinical expression. Thus DLB can be entcountered in different input modes: mild cognitive impairment, depression, acute behavioral disorders, confusion and delirium, or sleep disorders. In the aim to better diagnose the disease, should be sought obviously to search for the key symptoms: fluctuations, hallucinations, extra-pyramidal syndrome, and REM sleep behavior disorder. These symptoms are more subtle at the prodromal stage (mild neurocognitive disorder) than at the major stage. Thus fluctuations can be cognitive, simply as attentionnal fluctuations, or of alertness, such as sleepiness or more frequent nap; the visual phenomena can begin by sensation of passage, sensation of presence, or illusions; the extra-pyramidal syndrome can be really subtle such as isolated amimia or rigidity detected only with Froment's manœuvre. The frequent accompagnying symptoms are autonomic symptoms such as rhinorrhea or constipation, or sensorial symptoms such as olfactory impairment. The clinician has to be aware of the frequent presence of geriatric syndroms, also at the prodromal stage and including: falls, orthostatic hypotension, syncopa, urinary troubles, depression, delirium (after surgery, during infection...). On neuropsychological tests, sub-cortical frontal syndrome is frequent, visual memory impairment, visuospatial impairment and visuo-constructive difficulties are also characteristics. On brain MRI, isolated diminished insula is to look for. CSF analysis is usually normal but sometimes with low Abeta-42. Dat-Scan and MIBG scintigraphy were not enough explored in this context. Thus, with every patient presenting a compatible input mode, the search for symptoms of DLB has to be systematic, in the aim to have an etiological diagnosis of prodromal DLB, to avoid adverse drug events (neuroleptics) and to optimize care for patients.",

Representative cases that illustrate visual hallucinations due to ophthalmological, vascular, or degenerative processes are presented. Visual hallucinations can be linked to disorders in multiple parts of the nervous system. Even when related to medications, dementia may also be contributory, as is illustrated by the hallucinations seen in those with Parkinson's disease. Treatment of visual hallucinations is treatment of the underlying cause although some newer drugs such as clozapine may also be helpful for selected patients.",

Individuals with sleep apnea often stop breathing completely (apnea) or partially (hypopnea) during sleep for 10 seconds or more and sometimes for more than one minute, which leads to low oxygen in the brain and other organs. Sleep apnea is, therefore, a chronic condition where the normal sleep respiratory cycle is disrupted. Approximately 25% of adults seem to have sleep apnea of some degree. Men seem to be more commonly affected than women (especially pre-menopausal women). Other risk factors include: older age, overweight or obesity, and having a small mouth, jaw or throat, large tongue or retro-position of the lower jaw. Smoking, alcohol, ingestion of sedative medications, chronic nasal inflammation (rhinitis) with obstruction, large neck girth, etc represent risk factors for this disorder. Sleep apnea can be treated by applying continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), dental appliances or surgery. The decision to treat and with what specific modality is dependent on a complex interplay of symptoms, co-existent disorders and disease severity. This decision should be made by the patient in conjunction with the healthcare provider, preferably a specialist in Sleep Medicine who has enough experience in diagnosing and treating this condition.",

A insonia primaria cronica deve se diferenciar da insonia vinculada a uma higiene inadequada do sono, uma sindrome depressiva ou um transtorno de ansiedade generalizado. O tratamento da insonia primaria inclui: higiene adequada do sono, terapia cognitiva e de conduta e uso de farmacos hipnoticos. Entre esses ultimos, se destacam o zolpidem e a zopiclona, que melhoram significativamente o sono sem alterar sua estrutura ou induzir a uma reincidencia da insonia logo apos uma interrupcao brusca. Alem disso, o desenvolvimento de farmaco-dependencia e de vicio e muito pouco frequente. Primary insomnia is a dyssomnia characterized by a complaint of difficulty in initiating or maintaining sleep and the absence of restorative sleep that lasts for at least 1 month. The polysomnographic test shows alterations in the induction, continuity and structure of sleep. Primary insomnia typically begins in young adulthood, has a chronic course, and it is more prevalent among women. Its prevalence among patients with chronic insomnia ranges from 12.5% to 22.2%. Primary insomnia must be distinguished from insomnia related to inadequate sleep hygiene or another mental disorder, such as generalized anxiety disorder or a mood disorder. The treatment of primary insomnia consists of nonpharmacological strategies (sleep hygiene, behavior-cognitive therapy) and sleep-promoting medication (e.g. hypnotics). Few differences exist between benzodiazepines, zopiclone and zolpidem in terms of effectiveness in inducing and maintaining sleep. However, in contrast to benzodiazepines, zolpidem and zopiclone do not suppress slow-wave sleep. Rebound insomnia and drug addiction are uncommon. Resumo Summary",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a devasting mental disorder that is the focus of a great deal of research. Some symptoms of the disease, such as auditory hallucinations and delusions, can be ameliorated with drug treatment, whereas other symptoms, such as social withdrawal and cognitive decline, remain uncontrolled. It is possible that these latter symptoms that are often termed ''negative symptoms'' are the result of anatomical and neurochemical abnormalities, whereas those symptoms of the disease such as auditory hallucinations that are termed ''positive symptoms'' may be a result of only neurochemical disorders. The drugs used to treat schizophrenia are designated neuroleptics. The term neuroleptic was chosen to emphasize the similarity of pharmacological profiles of drugs with entirely different chemical structures. Especially prominent features of the effects of neuroleptics include the following: a state of affective indifference; a decrease in locomotor activity; a decrease in excitation, agitation, and aggressiveness; and an antipsychotic action in patients with acute as well as chronic psychoses.",

Häufig wird in den Lehrbüchern hier lapidar auf neurotoxische Schäden des Alkoholismus oder Mangelzustände verwiesen. In Teilbereichen ist die Forschung aber heute schon weiter. Im Vortrag wird ein kurzer Überblick über die wichtigsten neuropsychiatrischen Folgeschäden bei Alkoholismus gegeben und einige aktuelle Befunde zu Pathophysiologie und Therapie mitgeteilt. Eines der thematisierten Krankheitsbilder betrifft dabei die Alkoholhalluzinose, eine eher seltene Störung, bei denen der Alkoholkranke an akustischen Halluzinationen, gelegentlich auch paranoiden Symptomen oder Bewusstseins- und Orientierungsstörungen leidet. Trotz phänomenologischer Ähnlichkeit besteht offensichtlich keine genetische Verbindung zur Schizophrenie. Kasuistische Beobachtungen aus der Bildgebung haben gezeigt, dass bei Patienten mit Alkoholhalluzinose häufig eine Hypofunktion des Thalamus vorliegt, ähnlich wie bei schizophrenen Erkrankungen. Ein weiterer Schwerpunkt des Vortrages wird das Wernicke-Korsakow-Syndrom sein, für das bislang keine ausreichenden Therapiemöglichkeiten bestehen.",

      "title": "Cycloid psychosis",
      "abstract": "Introduction When we talk about cycloid psychosis we have doubts about their nosological enclave; whether they should be considered as a subform of schizophrenia or as independent psychoses.Some solutions were proposed, such as the thesis of mixed psychoses (Kretschmer) or that of intermediate forms (Bleuler, Schneider). Cycloid psychoses and bouffée delirante are recognized in ICD-10 under the name of acute polymorphic disorder without symptoms of schizophrenia (F23.0) and with symptoms of schizophrenia (F23.1). Objectives Clinical case Methods We present the case of a 16-year-old patient with no psychiatric history, with medical background of epilepsy; she was in fllow-up by Neurology and in treatment with valproate.Neurology indicates to stop treatment; it is then whwn the patient begins to appear disoriented, confused, with significant anguish and lability and regressive behaviors.She has sudden mood swings (from laughing to crying); sudden changes in emotional reaction (from distress to anger) and sudden changes in behavior (from agitation to prostration); verbiage with pressure of speech and dysprosodia; delusional ideation and incongruous affect; visual, auditive and kinesthetic hallucinations with important repercussion. We request blood and urine tests, drug test, EEG, cranial MRI. Results She presents fluctuating, polymorphic and unstable affective and psychotic symptoms. What is the most appropriate diagnosis? We treat the patient with antipsychotic, mood stabilizer and anxiolytic treatment. Conclusions Psychopathology in early ages is not so clearly defined and it can take very different forms. The diagnosis of cycloid psychosis can be useful as well as necessary to describe certain patients with similar characteristics and different from other groups. Disclosure No significant relationships.",

      "abstract": "Phencyclidine is now one of the most frequently used main ingredients of \"street drug\" preparations. Its effects are highly dose dependent and three varieties of acute intoxication have been seen clinically associated with different dosages and routes of administration. Most persons using phencyclidine smoke it sprinkled on parsley in low doses. The presence of horizontal and vertical nystagmus associated with hypertension in a patient who is agitated or comatose are diagnostic of a phencyclidine intoxicated state. Sensory isolation and intravenous administration of diazepam in the event of seizure activity have proved effective in the treatment of acute intoxicated states. Phencyclidine has pronounced behavioral toxicity and several deaths due to this agent have now been documented. It is unknown whether seizure activity or respiratory depression is the primary cause of death in pharmacological overdoses.",

They encompass many drugs, some of which are highly susceptible to abuse and others which are rarely associated with excess usage. A straightforward definition of a \"stimulant\" is \"a drug which stimulates some bodily function.\" Cocaine and amphetamine addicts often consume 10 to 50 times as much drug as would be indicated for novice. Also, for both agents there are no prominent physical withdrawal symptoms, except for depression. Almost all addicts become psychotic on one or more occasions. The psychosis is very similar for amphetamine and cocaine and difficult to distinguish from paranoid schizophrenia. A differential neurochemical mediation of euphoria and the psychotic effects of amphetamine and cocaine is hinted at by differences in the clinical features of the two phenomena. Low doses of amphetamine produce moderate euphoria and increased alertness in adults.",

Some individuals who are depressed may simply develop failure to thrive. Other depressives in old age manifest major depression or bipolar disorder as an extension of earlier episodes or are caused by neurobiologic changes or damage such as vascular disease.

Individual factors are important and can profoundly influence both the type and extent of drug effects. Relevant drugs can be divided into: 1. Those prescribed primarily to treat psychiatric disorders. These include sleeping tablets, tranquillizers, antidepressants and antipsychotics. 2. Those used to treat neurological disorders that have psychological side-effects. Examples are anticonvulsants and anti-parkinsonian drugs. 3. Those used to treat non-nervous disorders that may have psychological side-effects. 4. Illicit drugs used in the non-medical context by drug addicts. Drug-induced states that can influence testimony are mainly sedation, disinhibition, paradoxical reactions and alterations in memory. A list of pointers was given in this paper with respect to practical considerations in assessing the possible effects of drugs on testimony.",

This paper described the relationship between several medical agents (neuroleptics, anti-depressants, anti-anxietics, anti-convulsants, psychostimulants, and drugs other than CNS-effective agents) and those effect on sleep and sleep stages. In the medicated patients, medical drugs are mainly responsible for their insomnia. However, it is sometimes difficult to find these drugs. The pathological sleep (i.e., delirium) are often developed following the drug-induced insomnia. Medication against insomnia (i.e., benzodiazepines) often exacerbates the pathological sleep. Therefore, common types of insomnia, drug-induced insomnia and pathological sleep should carefully be discriminated. Drug-induced rhythm-disorders and drug-induced sleep apnea remain to be studied. Future studies may clarify the effects of several drugs on these two disorders.",

Among the most frequent reasons of insomnia one can mention the overuse of coffee, alcohol, smoking, using some drugs, stress, depression, neurosis, dementia, chronic diseases. Idiopathic insomnia constitutes less than 5% of cases. Before the treatment of insomnia is started, its cause should be found and it should be determined if it is transient or chronic. The treatment of insomnia can be based on pharmacotherapy and non-pharmacotherapy methods. Behavioural therapy is mentioned among non-pharmacotherapeutic methods. It aims at changing the sleep-related habits. Pharmacotherapeutic treatment (still mostly based on benzodiazepines) should not last longer than 2-3 weeks and drugs of short elimination T 1/2 (below 6 hours) should be used. Side-effects of this group of drugs should always be taken into consideration. It should be remembered that sleep disturbances can be symptoms of other diseases and their treatment cannot consist in prescribing hypnotics only.",

Nocturnal withdrawal symptoms may lead to an increased duration of wakefulness, and to tachycardia and sweating in the second half of the night. It is not known by which mechanism alcohol affects sleep; however, effects do not appear to depend on the stimulation of benzodiazepine receptors or the antagonism at adenosine receptors. Alcohol can exacerbate primary sleep disturbances such as sleep apnea and nocturnal myoclonus, and thereby contribute to excessive daytime sleepiness. The sleep of alcoholic patients is characterized by increased sleep latency, and reduced sleep efficiency, total sleep time, slow wave sleep and non-REM sleep. Even during abstinence, the changes in sleep architecture can persist for months or years, and might contribute to a relapse into alcoholism. The use of benzodiazepines or other hypnotics to treat alcohol-related sleep disturbances is not recommended.",

Nonconvulsive status epilepticus (NCSE) is an epileptic condition, lasting more than 30 min, characterized by con tinuous or recurrent epileptic activity on EEG, which is responsible for various clinical symptoms (especially in mental status or behavior) in the absence of manifest seizure activity. It includes different clinical forms, from minor confusion to complex behavioral disorders, psychosis, or coma. These psychotic symptoms can be very complex and their differential diagnosis can be difficult. We report the case of a 31-year-old male patient without previous personal or family recorded history of epilepsy and/or schizophrenic disorder, without identifiable stressors, showing a subacute episode of anxiety with aggression. Initially, he was discharged without treatment. Seven days later he went to the emergency services accompanied by his family members reporting delusions of injury. He presented a disorganized behavior with self-harm, anxiety, dysesthesia, cenestopathy and in ternal field hallucinations (auditory and visual). The initial EEG study revealed a nonconvulsive status with an active tempo ral focus. In this patient, the psychotic symptoms and EEG abnormalities consistent with NCSE appeared simultaneously. Once the EEG returned to normal, the symptoms only persisted residually and were compatible with intraictal psychosis.",

      "title": "Η σχέση υποκειμενικής γνωστικής έκπτωσης και διατροφής στον ελληνικό πληθυσμό τρίτης ηλικίας",
      "abstract": "Τα τελευταία χρόνια κερδίζει έδαφος η ιδέα της υποκειμενικής γνωστικής έκπτωσης (ΥΓΕ) ως υποψηφίου ισοδυνάμου του προκλινικού σταδίου της νόσου Alzheimer. Ως υποκειμενική γνωστική έκπτωση (subjective cognitive decline) ορίζουμε την (αυθόρμητη ή μη) αναφορά από ένα άτομο παραπόνων για εμμένουσα έκπτωση της μνήμης ή άλλων γνωστικών λειτουργιών σε σχέση με το προηγούμενο επίπεδο, χωρίς από την αντικειμενική εξέταση να προκύπτει νευρογνωστική διαταραχή (ήπια γνωστική διαταραχή ή κλινική άνοια), λαμβανομένων υπόψη της ηλικίας, του φύλου και του μορφωτικού επιπέδου. Η έκπτωση πρέπει επίσης να μη σχετίζεται με κάποιο οξύ συμβάν και να μην μπορεί να εξηγηθεί από άλλη νευρολογική, ψυχιατρική ή παθολογική νόσο, λήψη φαρμάκων ή ουσιών. Τα δεδομένα υποδηλώνουν ότι τα άτομα αυτά έχουν αυξημένο κίνδυνο νόσησης από άνοια στο μέλλον και συνιστούν ελκυστικό ερευνητικό στόχο, τόσο για επιδημιολογικές, όσο και παρεμβατικές μελέτες.Εφόσον η ΥΓΕ είναι παράγοντας κινδύνου για τη μετέπειτα εγκατάσταση κλινικής άνοιας, είναι ιδιαίτερα ενδιαφέρον να μελετηθούν οι παράμετροι που θα μπορούσαν να επηρεάσουν αυτήν την εξέλιξη. Ένας από τους πιο ενδιαφέροντες παράγοντες που σχετίζονται με τον τρόπο ζωής είναι η διατροφή, η οποία προσφέρεται ως στόχος για την υιοθέτηση ευρείας κλίμακας στρατηγικών πρόληψης της γνωστικής έκπτωσης με καλή σχέση κόστους-αποτελεσματικότητας. Καθώς η διεθνής βιβλιογραφία παρουσιάζει σημαντικές ελλείψεις στη μελέτη της σχέσης ΥΓΕ και διατροφής, η παρούσα διδακτορική διατριβή φιλοδοξεί να συνεισφέρει στην κάλυψη αυτού του κενού. Για το σκοπό αυτό, η εργασία στηρίχθηκε στα δεδομένα της μελέτης HELIAD [Hellenic Epidemiological Longitudinal Investigation of Aging and Diet (Νευροεκφυλιστικές και άλλες νευρολογικές νόσοι στον ελληνικό πληθυσμό – συχνότητες και παράγοντες κινδύνου)] και κινήθηκε σε δύο παράλληλους σχεδιασμούς:1.Συγχρονική μελέτη (cross-sectional), με στόχο τη διερεύνηση του επιπολασμού συγκεκριμένων ειδών ΥΓΕ και της σχέσης τους με ποικίλους παράγοντες, μεταξύ των οποίων και τη διατροφή·2.Προοπτική μελέτη (prospective cohort), με στόχο τη διερεύνηση της επίδρασης της διατροφής στην εξέλιξη της ΥΓΕ στο χρόνο.Τα παράπονα που σχετίζονται με ΥΓΕ αναδείχθηκαν με τη βοήθεια ενός δομημένου καταλόγου ερωτήσεων/θεμάτων για συζήτηση με το συμμετέχοντα. Η ΥΓΕ ταξινομήθηκε ανάλογα με το γνωστικό πεδίο στο οποίο ο συμμετέχων εντοπίζει προβλήματα, δηλαδή τη μνήμη, το λόγο, την οπτική-αντιληπτική και την επιτελική λειτουργία. Οι συμμετέχοντες θεωρήθηκαν θετικοί για ένα είδος ΥΓΕ σε περίπτωση τουλάχιστον μίας θετικής απάντησης στις ερωτήσεις του συγκεκριμένου γνωστικού πεδίου. Η συνολική βαθμολογία ΥΓΕ ορίστηκε ως ο αριθμός των αναφερόμενων γνωστικών πεδίων με ΥΓΕ και συνεπώς κυμαίνεται από 0 ως 4.Με βάση τα ευρήματα από το συγχρονικό σκέλος της μελέτης, η ΥΓΕ στον ελληνικό πληθυσμό ≥65 ετών είναι πολύ συχνή (84,6%) και εστιάζεται κυρίως στη μνήμη. Τα συμπτώματα άγχους και η ύπαρξη αγγειακού εγκεφαλικού κινδύνου σχετίζονται με αυξημένη πιθανότητα ΥΓΕ, ενώ προστατευτικό ρόλο φαίνεται να έχει η εκπαίδευση. Όσον αφορά τα είδη ΥΓΕ, σημειώνεται η επιβαρυντική δράση του γυναικείου φύλου, της γενετικής προδιάθεσης για γνωστική έκπτωση και της αυξημένης ενεργειακής πρόσληψης στην εμφάνιση υποκειμενικής έκπτωσης στη μνήμη. Η παρουσία συμπτωμάτων κατάθλιψης ή/και άγχους και η πρόοδος της ηλικίας συνδέονται επίσης με τα περισσότερα είδη ΥΓΕ.Αναλύοντας τα δεδομένα από την προοπτική παρακολούθηση του δείγματός μας, υπολογίσαμε ότι αρχική συμμόρφωση με το διατροφικό πρότυπο της μεσογειακής δίαιτας υψηλότερη κατά 10 μονάδες στην κλίμακα MDS (Mediterranean Diet Score) σχετίζεται με μείωση κατά 7% στην εξέλιξη της ΥΓΕ ανά έτος, και ότι κάθε επιπλέον μερίδα λαχανικών καθημερινά σχετίζεται με περιορισμό κατά 2,2% της προόδου της ΥΓΕ ανά έτος. Τα αποτελέσματά μας ενισχύουν την άποψη ότι η μεσογειακή δίαιτα δρα προστατευτικά έναντι ολόκληρου του συνεχούς της γνωστικής έκπτωσης, ξεκινώντας από τα πρώτα γνωστικά παράπονα. Η επιβεβαίωση των ευρημάτων αυτών και από άλλες μελέτες, ιδίως για συγκεκριμένες ομάδες τροφίμων, και η αποσαφήνιση των υποκείμενων μηχανισμών μπορεί να ενδυναμώσει το ρόλο της μεσογειακής δίαιτας ως εύκολα εφαρμόσιμης, χαμηλού κόστους και υψηλής αποτελεσματικότητας στρατηγικής πρόληψης που στοχεύει τους τροποποιήσιμους παράγοντες κινδύνου για γνωστική έκπτωση.",

      "abstract": "Panic disorder is one of the anxiety disorders, characterized by sudden and unexpected attacks of panic. Usually occurs with agoraphobia. \r\nTypical signs of a panic attack include: palpitations, sweating, trembling, breathlessness, feeling of suffocation, pain or discomfort in the chest, nausea , dizziness or light-headedness.Fear of losing control, fear going mad, fear of death, tingling in the body, overwhelming heat or cold, feeling that the environment has changed, feeling as if the person has been changed or is separated from oneself. A panic attack usually lasts a few minutes. It can also occur during sleep, so the person wakes up in terrible fear. When attacks occur in certain situations (eg. Ride the bus, elevator, stay in a larger group of people), it may happen that a person begins to avoid such situations, which leads to limited functioning and consequently lead to isolation. Fear of possible new attacks have been increased, there have been changes in the normal schedule and increasingly severed daily activities. Before the diagnosis of panic disorder, due to very unpleasant and many physical symptoms, such people usually undergo extensive and long-term physical treatment, and there are frequent visits to the emergency department related to the feeling of fear that is associated with such disorders. \r\nPanic disorder typically develops at an earlier age and is more common in women. The cause of the attack can be a specific event, a specific situation, activity (in the case of phobias), but attacks can occur quite unexpectedly, without a clear cause. As possible causes are important different life events (loss of a close person, divorce, job loss, etc..). \r\nAccording to cognitive-behavioral theories of anxiety, panic is a response to external stimuli, which are learned from closest people (usually a parent).\r\n According to psychodynamic theory, panic attack is unsuccessful defense against impulses that stimulate anxiety (in the background there is a need for separation and independence) or anxiety is the result of unconscious mental conflict between repressed desires that are usually transformed into some physical symptoms. Treatment of this disorder is individual and combined drug therapy with psychotherapy. The duration of treatment is different (a few weeks, and sometimes more than a year). Antidepressants (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) are the first choice in the treatment of panic disorder. anxiolytics and tricyclic antidepressants are also used. Sometimes just an explanation of the reasons for the occurrence of symptoms leads to improvements.\r\n Commonly prescribed is the combination of an antidepressant and / or anxiolytic compounds from the group of benzodiazepines. Psychotherapy can help change the way of thinking that leads to the emergence of panic attacks or disorder. \r\nIt's important to start treatment of this disorder in order to prevent further complications that impaire functioning of people and significantly affect quality of life.",

Less commonly among the sequelae, or in what we now regard as the chronic stage of the disease, similar disturbances occur. These phenomena were classified by Marie1into (1) disturbances of respiration proper, as tachypnea (either permanent or paroxysmal with periods of apnea), and bradypnea; (2) spasmodic cough, and (3) respiratory tics. They may be associated with other disturbances, such as the pseudo-Parkinson syndrome, or may be the predominating symptom.

      "abstract": "Since 1947, when the peculiar effects of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) on psychic functions were first described (Stoll) interest in this substance both in purely scientific and clinical circles has steadily increased. The psychological disturbances provoked in man by LSD are rather specific even though they are to some extent similar to those observed with alcohol, cocaine, or marihuana and, even more so, to those of mescaline or psylocibin. In fact, the disturbances of perception, the visual hallucinations, the sense of depersonalization, and in some instances a certain clouding of consciousness, are produced by extremely minute doses (0.001 mg./kg.), and the pronounced psychic manifestations are observed with relatively slight secondary effects or alterations of other systems.",

It is more likely that head injury can sometimes unmask an underlying predisposition to another neuropsychiatric disease that has already begun to manifest, often sub-clinically. Such unmasking may occur as a result of a brain injury superimposed on an already vulnerable brain, or a brain injury that contextually removes the individual from a routine that served as a reliable and dependable structural context. Thus, when abrupt neuropsychiatric manifestations such as psychosis or dementia manifest after concussion, a thorough neuropsychiatric evaluation should be performed, and one should not simply assume that concussion is the cause.",

The present flourishing of circadian biology has revealed the molecular basis of 24-h rhythmicity driven by 'clock' genes, as well as the importance of zeitgebers (synchronisers). Winter depression was first modelled on regulation of animal behaviour by seasonal changes in daylength, and led to application of light as the first successful chronobiological treatment in psychiatry. Light therapy has great promise for many other disorders (e.g. sleep–wake cycle disturbances in Alzheimer's dementia, bulimia, premenstrual disorder, depression during pregnancy) and, importantly, as an adjuvant to antidepressant medication in major non-seasonal depression. The pineal hormone melatonin is also a zeitgeber for the human circadian system, in addition to possessing direct sleep-promoting effects. Chronobiology has provided efficacious non-pharmaceutical treatments for mood disorders (such as sleep deprivation or light therapy) as well as novel approaches to new drugs (e.g. agomelatine).",

In all these cases, dopaminergic treatment can be helpful. However, many other nonmotor (and motor) symptoms will have no correlation with dopamine; therefore, they require different treatments, very often with little efficacy, as in apathy or cognitive decline.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Dementia is characterized by an insidious and progressive loss of memory, disorientation, cognitive decline in other domains, and affective flattening. It is often accompanied by neuropsychological deficits such as aphasia, apraxia, agnosia, or disturbances in executive functioning including planning, organizing, and sequencing of events in a logical fashion. Behavioural symptoms such as withdrawal, depression, delusions, motor restlessness, wander-ing, or aggression may complicate dementia, particularly in advanced stages of the disorder. These behavioural symptoms may occur, in part, secondary to loss of orientation and memory, with loss of autobiographic memory perhaps being most devastating. A patient, for example, who is impaired in retrieving past social interactions from autobiographical memory or recalling other relevant personal information may be more likely to respond with increasing irritability or anxiety in situations that are actually or perceived unfamiliar. Such a patient may perhaps choose a ‘safety first’ strategy or remain captured in indecisiveness, which could manifest in ruminating thinking and stereotyped behaviour, or displacement activities expressing motivational conflict and ambivalence. In any event, the combination of memory loss with other cognitive disturbances certainly leads to a profound deterioration of social competence. It is also noteworthy that, in addition to the problems the patients have themselves, which they generally deny except in the earliest stages of the disorder (anosognosia), dementia creates a substantial burden on patients’ spouses, children and other carers.",

The nature of the hallucination assists localization, differential diagnosis, and treatment planning. In particular, the presence of persistent visual hallucinations of persons with Parkinson's disease predicts dementia, rapid deterioration, permanent nursing home placement, and death. Hallucinations in persons with Alzheimer's disease are often associated with serious behavioral problems and predict a rapid cognitive decline. Theories of the etiology of hallucinations include (1) stimulation, e.g., neurochemical, electrical, seizure, and ephaptic, and (2) inhibition, e.g., destruction of normally inhibitory functions, resulting in disinhibition as in the Charles Bonnet and phantom limb syndromes. Functional neuroimaging procedures suggest anatomical associations for hallucinations. While hallucinations may be a symptom of medical, neurologic, and psychiatric disorders, they may also occur in a wide range of human experiences.",

Furthermore, psychiatric symptoms (PSs) in neurological disorders (NDs) among primary health care physicians and other specialties are often neglected. Anxiety and depression are most common, but hallucinations, delusions, obsessive-compulsive disorder and delirium or confusional state are also frequent comorbidity in many neurological conditions such as stroke, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson disease (PD). Depression and NDs also have a bidirectional relationship, as not only are patients, for example with stroke at greater risk of developing depression, but patients with depression have a two-fold greater risk of developing a stroke, even after controlling for other risk factors. Dementia or cognitive impairment are part of clinical picture of PD, stroke patients, patients with MS, Huntington disease etc. The prototype of dementia in PD and other NDs is a dysexecutive syndrome with impaired attention, executive functions and secondarily impaired memory. So-called \"functional\" (or psychogenic or hysterical/conversion) symptoms are relatively infrequent in \"neurological\" conditions, but very often unrecognized and not properly treated. Treatment of PSs in neurology, basically are not different then treatment of these symptoms in psychiatry and should be include pharmacotherapy and psychiatry. This presentation gives an overview of frequency and type of PSs underlying necessity to recognize these disorders in every day routine exam and properly treatment.",

Lesional headaches follow a sinusitis or an arthrosis, or accompany a \"temporal arteritis of Horton\". Functional headaches include several varieties. 1. Trigemellar neuralgia. 2. Vascular algia originating from the basal arteries, the large cerebral venous sinuses or the branches of the external carotid. Among these are: a) headaches due to a dilatation of the internal wall, causing \"Horton headache\", migrain-like psychosomatic migraine and hormonal migraines (premenstrual, menstrual, menopausal or linked to the use of contraceptive pills); b) headaches caused by an angiospasm of the arteriole, which is the case in exposure to the cold, in traumatic headaches (malfunction of temporomandibular articulation, dry alveolitis), in psychosomatic angiospastic algias and in ethmoidal artery algias previously described by the author in 1949 (Godin's disease). 3. Headaches due to psychic hypertension. 4. Postconcussional psychogenic headaches. 5. Neurotic headaches. The author gives a detailed description of the subjective symptoms in each case, including localisation, form, intensity, duration course and associated phenomenons. This facilitates greatly the differential diagnosis and the choice of complementary examinations. Necessary biological investigations should be performed (e.g. hormonal balance). One should however avoid to increase the number of complementary examinations which would only delay treatment and would expose patients to somatisation. Furthermore, in each case drug treatment, periarterial infiltration technics of the temporal, internal frontal, facial, mastoid and occipital arteries are described. The necessity of questioning the patient at length and to listen to him to enable him to verbalise conscious conflicts is emphasized. A serious medicopsychological examination and a relaxation treatment to reduce anxiety and muscular tension are advised in some cases.",

      "title": "Parental alienation: the impact on men’s mental health",
      "abstract": "Parental alienation is defined as a mental state in which a child, usually one whose parents are engaged in a high-conflict separation or divorce, allies himself strongly with one parent (the preferred parent) and rejects a relationship with the other parent (the alienated parent) without legitimate justification. Parental alienation may affect men's mental health: a) parental alienation negatively influences mental health of male children and adolescents who are victims of parental alienation. Alienated children/adolescents display guilt, sadness, and depressed mood; low self-esteem and lack of self-confidence; distress and frustration; lack of impulse control, substance abuse and delinquent behavior; separation anxiety, fears and phobias; hypochondria and increased tendency to develop psychosomatic illness; suicidal ideation and suicide attempt; sleep and eating disorders; educational problems; enuresis and encopresis; b) parental alienation negatively affects the mental health of adult men who were victims of parental alienation when they were children and/or adolescents. Long-term effects of parental alienation include low self-esteem, depression, drug/alcohol abuse, lack of trust, alienation from own children, divorce, problems with identity and not having a sense of belonging or roots, choosing not to have children to avoid being rejected by them, low achievement, anger and bitterness over the time lost with the alienated parent; c) parental alienation negatively influences mental health of men who are alienated from their children. Fathers who have lost some or all contact with their children for months or years following separation or divorce may be depressed and suicidal.",

In addition to deficits in affect expression and affect regulation, such patients manifest disturbances in inner self- and object representations and other aspects of self-regulation, which often lead to countertransferential or other interpersonal difficulties within therapeutic relationships. Their proneness to somatization may result in medical overinvestigation that can add an iatrogenic component to their illnesses; and their ‘affect storms’ or difficulty in relinquishing unhealthy affect regulatory behaviours, such as alcohol abuse or binge eating, may lead to feelings of frustration, anger, and helplessness in their treating physicians, nurses, or psychotherapists.",

In this short review, we will focus on the latter, i.e., the mathematical description of the ventilatory controller and some techniques to measure the ventilatory drive. Note that the model(s) we will discuss can be applied to “chemical control of breathing” only. Chemical control of breathing is control dependent on arterial blood gasses (e.g., PaCO 2 , PaO 2 , and pH), and it is active during states of mental relaxation, such as non‐REM sleep, anesthesia, and possibly physical relaxation. The models do not apply to the respiratory effects of exercise or behavioral/emotional activities such as eating, speaking, and playing a musical instrument.",

The feeling of anxiety often recedes into the background and such patients present to nonpsychiatric physicians with mainly somatic symptoms. The consequences of frequent panic attacks, named panic disorder, are agoraphobia with impairment of psychic and social functioning, increased prevalence of alcohol abuse, depression and, in particular, suicidal attempts. It is of the utmost importance that physicians recognize the somatic symptoms of panic anxiety and plan integrated treatment. The main therapeutic resources at present include antidepressants, selected benzodiazepines and behavioral treatments and are very successful in improving panic attacks and their consequences, which may long go undiagnosed.",

      "abstract": "RESUMEN La cefalea por uso excesivo de medicamentos (CUEM) se define como la presencia de cefalea diaria o casi diaria (15 dias o mas de evolucion), que se produce en pacientes con antecedente de cefalea primaria que usan excesivamente medicamentos. Esta entidad esta asociada a coomorbilidad psiquiatrica, por lo que las caracteristicas clinicas se hacen mas complejas con el paso del tiempo. El manejo fundamental se basa en la suspension del medicamento sobre el que se centra el abuso (analgesicos, ergotamina, triptanes y opioides). Sin embargo, es necesario tomar en consideracion que la suspension de estos medicamentos puede asociarse a otros problemas como “cefalea de rebote”, sindrome de abstinencia o convulsiones epilepticas; incrementando las tasas de recaida en estos pacientes. PALABRAS CLAVES. Cefalea. Medicamentos, Cefalea de tipo tensional, Trastornos migranosos, Cefaleas secundarias. (Martha R. Alvarez S, Ronald G. Garcia G, Federico Arturo Silva S. Cefalea por uso excesivo de medicamentos: implicaciones clinicas y terapeuticas . Acta Neurol Colomb 2010;26:195-201). SUMMARY The medication overuse headache (MOH) is define as daily or almost daily headache (15 days or more) in patients with history of primary headache who takes excessive medications. This pathology is associated with psychiatric conditions, reason why with the time the clinical characteristics become more complex. The basic treatment is stopping the medication (analgesic, ergotamine, triptans or opioids), but this could bring us another problem called “rebound headache”, withdrawal sindrome or epileptic convulsions. These symptoms could increase the relapsing rate on this patients.",

Encephalopathy that occurs in the patients with acute hepatic insufficiency or in the terrain of cirrhosis Is defined as acute hepatic encephalopathy. Degree of alteration in mental functions is highly variable. Minor deficits could be measured and detected by sophisticated psychometric or electroencephalometric tests (subclinical encephalopathy). As well as in other organic psychosyndromes hallucinations and confabulations can be present in the same time deficits of attention, emotions, psychomotor behavior, memory, or inversion of sleep wake cycle, which can lead to hepatic coma. In the early stages of hepatic encephalopathy behavior disturbances are usually present, therefore are treated with tranquillizers, especially benzodiazepine anxiolitycs which could precipitate cerebral dysfunction. It is of importance to stress that patients with hepatic encephalopathy are highly susceptible to exogenous and endogenous benzodiazepines, which Is one of the factors of disability of neurotransmission balance. Therefore use of benzodiazepines with long half life in plasma and active metabolites, is contraindicated in the patients with, liver cirrhosis and hepatic encephalopathy, because of the possibility of progression toward hepatic coma. On the basis of gabaergic hypothesis of pathogenesis of hepatic encephalopathy, benzodiazepine antagonists could be useful in the treatment. Flumazenil which posses high affinity for benzodiazepine receptors and is used for that purpose. Severe behavioral disturbances and delirium induced by hepatic encepahlopathy have been successfully treated by our clinical experience with chlormethiazole.",

According to the DSM-IV the term mood disorder is used for a group of diagnoses where the primary symptom is a disturbance in mood, or in other words the experience of an inappropriate, exaggerated or limited range of feelings. Mood disorders can mainly be divided into two groups: (1) depressive episode(s) characterised by feelings of sadness, hopelessness, helplessness, guilt, suicidal thoughts, fatigue, appetite changes, concentration problems and troubles engaging in daily living tasks; (2) manic or hypomanic episode(s) characterised by feelings of grandiosity, extreme energy and heightened arousal. Several treatment options are available for mood disorders – e.g. medication, cognitive and/or behavioural therapy – depending on the severity and the evaluation of the health-care provider. Several studies have shown that mood disorders are common in patients with cancer. In a meta-analysis, the point prevalence of major depression was about 16% and that of anxiety was 10% [1]. The exact causes of mood disorders are largely unknown, but it is hypothesised that an imbalance in neurotransmitters is likely to play a role. The mood disorder can be triggered by the cancer diagnosis on its own, or it can be treatment-induced in cases where the aetiology can be found in the physiological effect of a psychoactive drug or chemical substance. These articles provide an overview of the most common mood disorders among cancer patients. First, Dr. Dauchy will discuss the prevalence, predictive factors and treatment options of depression, one of the most under-diagnosed and inadequately treated mood disorders among cancer patients. Second, Professor Caraceni will introduce drug-associated delirium, an altered state of consciousness with reduced awareness of self and the environment, which may go hand in hand with the inability to think and talk clearly and rationally, hallucinations, disorientation and cognitive impairment. Third, Dr. Die Trill will discuss anxiety, one of the most frequently reported reactions to a cancer diagnosis, which may persist throughout the cancer continuum. In addition, she will shine her light on sleep disorders, which are frequently associated with psychological disorders. Finally, Dr. Schagen will describe the chemotherapy-related changes in cognitive functioning, which can result in diminished functional independence and can last throughout the survivorship period.",

The incidence of insomnia increases with age as medical problems increasingly occur, and patients with chronic insomnia are more likely to develop adverse health outcomes due to medical disease. There are multiple ways in which insomnia may be caused or aggravated by medical illness or bodily injury. Unpleasant stimuli can directly impede initiation of sleep, or they may cause frequent arousals or awakenings. Changes in basic systemic physiology (such as disorders of ventilation) may produce similar disruption in sleep continuity. There may be humoral changes that have direct neurochemical or neurophysiological effects, augmenting vigilance and lowering the threshold to arousal from sleep. The effects of acute and subacute sleep disruption can lead to chronic psychophysiological insomnia by creating the anticipation of disturbed sleep and by altering circadian entrainment, further accentuating the disruptive effects of the underlying medical condition. Difficulties with insomnia may persist long after the causative medical condition has been effectively managed.",

It is defined as complex behaviors during slow-wave (or deep) sleep, with the person often having no recollection of these events upon waking.1 It is associated with several medications, including sedative-hypnotics, antipsychotics, antidepressants, lithium, stimulants, antihistamines, and anticonvulsants.2-9 Other risk factors include a history of sleepwalking in a first-degree relative, sleep-disordered breathing, restless leg syndrome, separation anxiety, or events that increase deep sleep, such as evening exercise, sleep deprivation, or fever.10-13 Benzodiazepines are recommended for treating somnambulism, despite a lack of controlled trials.14 Gabapentin is often prescribed for seizures, neuropathic pain, or anxiety. Although there are no reports of somnambulism associated with gabapentin, it is hypothesized that gabapentin may cause somnambulism, given its effect on sleep architecture and anecdotal reports.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Insomnia, which is characterized by difficulty in initiating or maintaining a physiological sleep, is a relevant clinical issue, affecting not only the elderly population (from 20% to 40%), but also the general population since 30% of adults report problems in sleeping properly. In addition, 30-40% of adults report complaints about sleep quality lifetime, and10-15% report chronic insomniaBenzodiazepines (BZDs) are commonly prescribed to treat insomnia and sleep disorders. BZDs show a rapid sedative and anxiolytic effect, successfully used in the acute treatment of insomnia as well as anxiety, agitation, or anxiety associated with any type of psychiatric disorder. Their use is associated with potential side effects such as residual daytime sleepiness, ataxia, and dizziness. Long-term BZDs use may lead to drug abuse, tolerance, drug dependency, and abstinence. For instance, BZDs abrupt withdrawal can lead to severe symptoms such as insomnia and/or rebound anxiety, an increase in heart rate and blood pressure, nausea and/or vomiting, sweating, diarrhea, convulsions, and other neurological and psychiatric symptoms. Objectives This e-poster aimed to summarize evidence regarding the effect of BZDs treatment on human Sleep Architecture. Methods A bibliopgraphical review was performed using PubMed platform. All relevant articles were found using the keywords: benzodiazepines, sleep architecture, insomnia. Results Prolonged use of benzodiazepines leads to an increase of time spent in stages 2 and a decrease of time in stages 1, 3, and 4. The increased NREM stage 2 is associated with a subjective improvement in sleep quality. The decrease in NREM sleep time in stages 3 and 4 is usually associated with lesser “rest” for the brain, which leads to a lack of concentration. Conclusions BZDs use modified sleep architecture in the short and long term. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

      "title": "[Non-epileptic motor paroxysmal phenomena in wakefulness in childhood].",
      "abstract": "Paroxysmal events in childhood are a challenge for pediatric neurologists, given its highly heterogeneous clinical manifestations, often difficult to distinguish between phenomena of epileptic seizure or not. The non-epileptic paroxysmal episodes are neurological phenomena, with motor, sensory symptoms, and/or sensory impairments, with or without involvement of consciousness, epileptic phenomena unrelated, so no electroencephalographic correlative expression between or during episodes. From the clinical point of view can be classified into four groups: motor phenomena, syncope, migraine (and associated conditions) and acute psychiatric symptoms. In this paper we analyze paroxysmal motor phenomena in awake children, dividing them according to their clinical manifestations: extrapyramidal episodes (paroxysmal kinesiogenic, non kinesiogenic and not related to exercise dyskinesias, Dopa responsive dystonia) and similar symptoms of dystonia (Sandifer syndrome); manifestations of startle (hyperekplexia); episodic eye and head movements (benign paroxysmal tonic upward gaze nistagmus deviation); episodic ataxia (familial episodic ataxias, paroxysmal benign vertigo); stereotyped and phenomena of self-gratification; and myoclonic events (benign myoclonus of early infancy). The detection of these syndromes will, in many cases, allow an adequate genetic counseling, initiate a specific treatment and avoid unnecessary additional studies. Molecular studies have demonstrated a real relationship between epileptic and non-epileptic basis of many of these entities and surely the identification of the molecular basis and understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms in many of them allow us, in the near future will benefit our patients. Fenomenos paroxisticos no epilepticos motores en vigilia en la infancia.Los eventos paroxisticos en la infancia son un desafio para los neuropediatras por sus manifestaciones clinicas altamente heterogeneas, muchas veces dificiles de diferenciar entre fenomenos de origen epileptico o no epileptico. Los fenomenos paroxisticos no epilepticos son fenomenos neurologicos, episodicos, con sintomas motores, sensitivos o sensoriales, con o sin afectacion de la conciencia, no relacionados a fenomenos epilepticos, por lo cual no tienen correlato de expresion electroencefalografica entre o durante los episodios. Desde el punto de vista clinico, podemos clasificarlos en cuatro grandes grupos: fenomenos motores, sincopes, migraña (y condiciones asociadas) y cuadros psiquiatricos agudos. En este trabajo se analizan los fenomenos paroxisticos motores en vigilia, dividiendolos de acuerdo a sus manifestaciones clinicas en: episodios extrapiramidales (discinesias paroxisticas cinesiogenicas, no cinesiogenicas y relacionadas con el ejercicio, distonia sensible a levodopa) y cuadros simil distonia (sindrome de Sandifer); manifestaciones de sobresalto (hiperecplexia); movimientos episodicos oculares y cefalicos (desviacion tonica paroxistica de la mirada hacia arriba); ataxia episodica (ataxias episodicas autosomicas familiares y vertigo paroxistico benigno); estereotipias y fenomenos de autogratificacion; y eventos mioclonicos (mioclonias benignas de la infancia temprana). La deteccion de estos sindromes permitira, en muchos casos, realizar un asesoramiento genetico adecuado, instaurar un tratamiento especifico y evitar estudios complementarios innecesarios. Los estudios moleculares han demostrado una relacion entre las bases epilepticas y no epilepticas en muchas de estas entidades. Seguramente la identificacion de los aspectos moleculares y la comprension de los mecanismos fisiopatologicos de muchas de ellas permitiran en un futuro no muy lejano tratamientos especificos que beneficiaran a los pacientes.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Food addiction is a topic that has received attention in the psychological literature in part because of the role that it potentially plays in binge eating, obesity, and eating disorders. Food addiction has also received attention as an addiction in its own right, akin to widely known addictive substances and behaviors such as drugs, gambling, and sex. An addiction is defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM‐IV‐TR) as (1) the use of a substance that has mood altering or psychoactive effects, (2) highly controlled or compulsive use of a substance, and (3) the used substance reinforces behavior (American Psychiatric Association, 2000). Other criteria include tolerance and physical dependence. Food addiction specifically is typically characterized by a loss of control over eating certain foods, preoccupation with or craving of certain food or foods, failed attempts to overcome the eating problem despite negative consequences, and use of the food or foods to cope with negative emotions. Food addiction has been tied most often to highly palatable foods such as chocolate, confectionary foods, carbohydrate‐rich foods, and foods high in fat content.",

      "title": "Vulnerabilidad cognitiva a la hipocondría: intrusiones, valoraciones y creencias disfuncionales/ cognitive vulnerability to hypochondriasis: intrusions, appraisals and dysfunctional beliefs",
      "abstract": "Hypochondriasis is a disorder characterized by the fear or belief of suffering from a serious illness based on the negative interpretation of bodily signs and symptoms. After a thorough evaluation, confirmation by a physician that the patient does not have a medical condition does not result in safe and lasting reassurance. Generally, people with hypochondriasis may experience a reduction in anxiety after a visit to the doctor, but this reduction lasts only hours or days. When another symptom occurs, anxiety reappears, and the cycle of hypochondriacal worry resumes. In addition, hypochondriasis can manifest itself in different ways. Some patients have numerous intrusive thoughts and sensations during the day that lead them to consult family, friends, the Internet, or different medical specialists to make sure they are not seriously ill or to identify the course of the disease. Other patients, on the other hand, avoid health care providers and any reference to the disease in their daily lives, so that the anxiety they seek to suppress does not increase. Hypochondriasis has also been conceptualized in cognitive models as an extreme form of health anxiety. Cognitive-behavioral proposals of hypochondriasis and health anxiety and recent research on this disorder have suggested different cognitive variables as possible risk factors for the development and maintenance of the problem. They include intrusive thoughts about possible health hazards (illness-ITs), the dysfunctional appraisals/interpretations and beliefs associated with these thoughts, and dysfunctional assumptions or beliefs about health/illness. Although these variables have been pointed out in the literature as vulnerability factors for hypochondriasis and health anxiety, there are hardly any studies analyzing their role in the genesis and development of the disorder, and the results obtained are not entirely conclusive either. The purpose of this thesis is to clarify the role played by these variables in hypochondriasis and health anxiety. The preliminary study provided a reliable and valid instrument to evaluate health anxiety in Spanish-speaking adults, the Short Health Anxiety Inventory (SHAI). Study 1 explored the presence and characteristics of illness-ITs in the general population, and through this study, a new self-report instrument has been provided, the Illness Intrusive Thoughts Inventory (INPIE), to evaluate illness-ITs. Study 2 examined differences between patients with hypochondriasis and community participants in the recurrence of illness-ITs and the consequences of experiencing them. Studies 2 and 3 also evaluated the role of dysfunctional appraisals and beliefs about illness-ITs. Study 4 analyzed the importance of the family context in the adoption of dysfunctional beliefs about health/illness and thoughts. The results show that (1) the SHAI is an appropriate self-report instrument to measure health anxiety in the Spanish-speaking adult population; (2) the INPIE is an adequate self-report questionnaire to assess the frequency of illness-ITs, as well as the appraisals and control strategies associated with these thoughts; (3) illness-ITs are a universal and dimensional phenomenon; (4) dysfunctional appraisals/interpretations and beliefs about illness-ITs play a significant role in the escalation from normal intrusive cognitions and their associated consequences to clinical health anxiety-related symptoms; and (5) dysfunctional assumptions or beliefs about health/illness and thoughts can be acquired within the family. These results have substantial clinical implications because understanding the functioning and characteristics of some of the key elements in the genesis and development of hypochondriasis and health anxiety may improve and update the treatment protocols for these patients. La hipocondria es un trastorno caracterizado por el miedo o la creencia de padecer una enfermedad grave a partir de la interpretacion negativa de los signos y sintomas corporales. La confirmacion por parte de un medico, despues de una evaluacion exhaustiva, de que el paciente no padece una enfermedad medica, no tiene como resultado una tranquilizacion segura y duradera. Por lo general, las personas que presentan hipocondria pueden experimentar una reduccion de la ansiedad despues de visitar al medico, pero esta reduccion dura solo horas o dias. Cuando se presenta otro sintoma, la ansiedad reaparece y el ciclo de preocupacion hipocondriaca se reanuda. Ademas, la hipocondria se puede manifestar de diferentes maneras. Algunos pacientes tienen numerosos pensamientos intrusos y sensaciones durante el dia que los llevan a consultar con la familia, amigos, internet o diferentes especialistas medicos para asegurarse de que no estan gravemente enfermos o para identificar el curso de la enfermedad. Y, otros pacientes, por el contrario, evitan a los proveedores de servicios de salud y cualquier referencia a la enfermedad en su vida diaria, para que no aumente la ansiedad que buscan reprimir. La hipocondria se ha conceptualizado tambien, desde los modelos cognitivos, como la forma mas extrema de ansiedad por la salud. Las propuestas cognitivo-conductuales de la hipocondria y las investigaciones recientes en torno a este trastorno han sugerido diferentes variables cognitivas como posibles factores de riesgo para el desarrollo y mantenimiento del problema. Entre ellos, destacan: los pensamientos intrusos sobre los posibles peligros para la salud (PIEs), las valoraciones/interpretaciones y creencias disfuncionales asociadas a estos pensamientos, y los supuestos o creencias disfuncionales sobre la salud/enfermedad. Aunque todas estas variables se han senalado, en la literatura cientifica, como factores de vulnerabilidad hacia la hipocondria, no existen apenas estudios en los que se analice su papel en la genesis y evolucion del trastorno, y los resultados obtenidos tampoco son del todo concluyentes. Por todo ello, la presente Tesis tiene como finalidad clarificar el rol que juegan los pensamientos intrusos, las valoraciones/interpretaciones y las creencias disfuncionales (sobre los pensamientos y sobre la salud/enfermedad) en la hipocondria y la ansiedad por la salud. El estudio preliminar proporciono un instrumento fiable y valido para evaluar la ansiedad por la salud en adultos de habla hispana, el Inventario Breve de Ansiedad por la Salud (SHAI). El Estudio 1 exploro la presencia y caracteristicas de los PIEs en la poblacion general, y a traves de este estudio se ha proporcionado un nuevo instrumento de autoinforme, el Inventario de Pensamientos Intrusos sobre la Enfermedad (INPIE), para evaluar los PIEs. El estudio 2 examino las diferencias entre los pacientes con hipocondria y los participantes de la comunidad en la recurrencia con la que se experimentaban PIEs y las consecuencias derivadas de su experimentacion. Los estudios 2 y 3 tambien evaluaron el papel de las valoraciones y creencias disfuncionales asociadas a los PIEs. El estudio 4 analizo la importancia del contexto familiar en la adopcion de supuestos o creencias disfuncionales sobre la salud/enfermedad y los pensamientos. Los resultados muestran que (1) el SHAI es un instrumento de autoinforme apropiado para medir la ansiedad por la salud en la poblacion adulta de habla hispana; (2) el INPIE es un cuestionario de autoinforme adecuado para evaluar la frecuencia de los PIEs, asi como las valoraciones y estrategias de control asociadas a estos pensamientos; (3) los PIEs son un fenomeno universal y dimensional; (4) las valoraciones/interpretaciones y creencias disfuncionales asociadas a los PIEs juegan un papel significativo en la escalada de los pensamientos intrusos normales y sus consecuencias funcionales a los sintomas clinicos relacionados con la ansiedad por la salud, y (5) los supuestos o creencias disfuncionales sobre la salud/enfermedad y los pensamientos pueden adquirirse en el seno familiar. Estos resultados tienen implicaciones clinicas sustanciales, ya que la comprension del funcionamiento y las caracteristicas de algunos de los elementos clave para la genesis y el desarrollo de la hipocondria y la ansiedad para la salud puede mejorar y actualizar los protocolos de tratamiento para estos pacientes.",

New and rebound symptoms can occur for up to 6 weeks after drug withdrawal, depending on the drug elimination half-life [2, 3] , while persistent postwithdrawal or tardive disorders associated with longlasting receptor changes may persist for more than 6 weeks after drug discontinuation. Initial withdrawal symptoms from CNS drugs have been reported to be more frequent and severe when high-potency drugs and drugs with a short elimination half-life have been used [9, 10] . CNS drugs with a shorter elimination half-life and rapid onset of action also carry a higher risk of dependency and high-dose use [9, 10] . Withdrawal symptoms can be relatively short-lasting, lasting for a few hours to a few weeks with complete recovery, while others may persist and last for several months [1, 15, 16] . Fava et al. [1] have proposed using the terminology ‘withdrawal syndrome’ to replace the term ‘discontinuation syndrome’, which has been most often used to describe SSRI withdrawal. They have recommended the Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely used in clinical practice, and have advanced the treatment of depression and other mental disorders. However, more studies are needed on the effects of decreasing and discontinuing these medications after their long-term use [1] . Withdrawal symptoms may occur with all SSRIs and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [1] , similarly to other CNS drugs, including benzodiazepines [2–4] and antipsychotics [5, 6] . Withdrawal from SSRIs and other CNS drugs produces psychiatric symptoms that can be confounded with true relapse or recurrence of the original illness [1, 2, 7] . When discontinuing or decreasing SSRIs, withdrawal symptoms must be identified to avoid prolonging treatment or giving unnecessarily high doses [6, 8] . Different types of syndromes have been described with the withdrawal from SSRIs and other CNS drug classes, including benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, antidepressants, opiates, barbiturates, and alcohol: (1) new withdrawal symptoms (classic withdrawal symptoms from CNS drugs) [1, 4–6, 9–12] , (2) rebound [2, 6, 9, 13–16] , and (3) persistent postwithdrawal disorders [7, 17, 18] ( table 1 ). These types of withdrawal need to be differentiated from relapse and recurrence of the original illness.

      "abstract": "Background: Sleep paralysis is one of the many conditions of which visual hallucinations can be a part but has received relatively little attention. It can be associated with other dramatic symptoms of a psychotic nature likely to cause diagnostic uncertainty. Methods and results: These points are illustrated by the case of a young man with a severe bipolar affective disorder who independently developed terrifying visual, auditory and somatic hallucinatory episodes at sleep onset, associated with a sense of evil influence and presence. The episodes were not obviously related to his psychiatric disorder. Past diagnoses included nightmares and night terrors. Review provided no convincing evidence of various other sleep disorders nor physical conditions in which hallucinatory experiences can occur. A diagnosis of predormital isolated sleep paralysis was made and appropriate treatment recommended. Conclusions: Sleep paralysis, common in the general population, can be associated with dramatic auxiliary symptoms suggestive of a psychotic state. Less common forms are either part of the narcolepsy syndrome or (rarely) they are familial in type. Interestingly, sleep paralysis (especially breathing difficulty) features prominently in the folklore of various countries.",

In later life, insomnia and other sleep disturbances are common. Insomnia is experienced as poor, disrupted, or insufficient sleep associated with significant daytime impairments including increased fatigue or reduced energy, impaired cognitive function, and increased mood disturbance. Poor sleep is associated with negative outcomes across a range of dimensions that impair quality of life, increases risk for other diseases, and may interact negatively with the progression and treatment of other disorders. Evidence for effective psychological interventions to improve sleep in later life, specifically cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, is robust and well described. Good sleep should be understood as a substrate for psychological health and a reasonable expectation in later life.",

      "abstract": "Schlafstörungen treten bei Patienten mit Demenz häufig auf, dazu gehören ein umgekehrter Schlaf-Wach-Rhythmus sowie Ein- und Durchschlafstörungen. Dieser Umstand führt dazu, dass die Pflege der Patienten durch Angehörige oder Pflegekräfte in Heimen eine besondere Herausforderung darstellt. Während die Evidenzen für pharmakologische Interventionen (Cholinesteraseinhibitoren sowie Melatonin) eher schwach sind, ist die Evidenzlage für die Kombination aus sensorischer Stimulation, Lichttherapie und Melatonin überzeugend. Dennoch werden meist sedierende Antipsychotika oder Benzodiazepine eingesetzt, um das Schlafverhalten zu verbessern. Aufgrund des negativen Nebenwirkungsprofils und erhöhten Mortalitätsraten ist der Einsatz dieser Pharmaka jedoch als äußerst kritisch zu sehen. Zu den nicht pharmakologischen Interventionen gehören kognitive und validierende Interventionen, sensorische Stimulationstherapien (dazu gehören Musiktherapie, Aromatherapie, Massage, Lichttherapie, multisensorische Therapie und Akupunktur), Techniken zur Veränderung des Verhaltens sowie andere psychosoziale Interventionen. Griechische Wissenschaftler haben in einer kürzlich publizierten Arbeit die Studienlage zur sensorischen Stimulatiion in Hinblick auf das Schlafverhalten dementer Patienten sondiert und zusammengefasst. Es wurden nur randomisierte, kontrollierte Studien mit Fokus auf Schlafstörungen eingeschlossen. Insgesamt wurden nur 11 Studien mit einer Gesamtzahl von 760 Patienten eingeschlossen, wovon 1 Studie die Effekte von Massagetherapie und Akupunktur untersuchte, während die restlichen 10 Studien die Effekte von Lichttherapie (zwischen 5000 und 10 000 Lux) untersuchten. 6 Studien zur Lichttherapie zeigten dabei positive Ergebnisse in Bezug auf die Schlafqualität, während in den anderen 4 Studien keine positiven Effekte nachgewiesen werden konnten. Da 4 der 10 Studien zur Lichttherapie eine relativ niedrige Fallzahl (< 25) aufwiesen, ist die Aussagekraft des Reviews allerdings nicht wirklich hoch. Auch war die Dauer der Intervention sehr heterogen (zwischen 10 Tagen und 3,5 Jahren). Die Studie zur Massagetherapie und Akupunktur mit insgesamt 111 Patienten wies ein positives Ergebnis auf.",

      "abstract": "Psychiatric illness is common, affecting up to 10% of the population, with around 1% diagnosed with a major psychiatric disorder. An increased mortality rate in the postoperative period for schizophrenic patients receiving chronic antipsychotic therapy has been demonstrated. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Disease, schizophrenia-associated psychotic disorders are characterized by disturbances in emotional, behavioral and cognitive arenas, impeding on nearly every aspect of life functioning in the form of thought disorders, delusions and hallucinations. Chronic schizophrenic patients lack pain sensitivity, and have pituitary-adrenal and autonomic nerve dysfunction, abnormalities of the immune system, and water intoxication. These alterations may influence postoperative outcome. Psychotropic drugs often given in combination with each other or with other non-psychiatric drugs generally exert profound effects on the central and peripheral neurotransmitter and ionic mechanisms. The increased complications are associated with physical disorders, antipsychotic or hazardous health behaviour and interactions between antipsychotics and anaesthetic drugs. Adverse responses during anaesthesia include arrhythmias, hypotension, prolonged narcosis or coma, hyperpyrexia, post-operative ileus and post-operative confusion. Although drug interaction probably remains the most potentially serious problem current evidence suggests that psychiatric medication need not be discontinued prior to anesthesia.",

One or the other is not enough. You need both. You do not need a scan or lab test to make the diagnosis. No scan or test can “rule in” or “rule out” concussion. You do not need to perform a detailed neurological exam to make the diagnosis. The neurological exam is usually unremarkable except for immediately after the concussion. No exam findings “rule in” or “rule out” concussion. A collateral source is key to obtaining a reliable history. The impairment in brain function occurs immediately after the event. The impairment is worst immediately after the event, then gradually improves. There is no other obvious explanation for the impairment.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Cause of death rulings in cases when the concentration of a drug or drugs is higher than observed following therapeutic use are generally straightforward “drug deaths.” However, when toxicology testing identifies drug concentrations consistent with therapeutic use or detects no drugs at all, then the cause of death determination is more complicated. Given the rapidity and protean manifestations of anaphylaxis, it should be considered in deaths where no other cause of death is apparent in a suspected drug death. This article reports two cases where an anaphylactic reaction was observed following either the actual or alleged use of therapeutic formulations of buprenorphine intravenously.",

      "title": "Hypoactive Delirium Caused by Pulmonary Embolus in an Elderly Adult",
      "abstract": "Delirium is frequently observed in individuals aged 65 and older (10–30%).1 Delirium has an acute onset—within hours to days—and exhibits a fluctuating course. Delirium is characterized by distorted attention, reduced awareness of the environment, alteration in at least one cognitive area (disturbed memory, orientation, language, perception), and change in sleep cycles.2 Because of the wide range of clinical presentation, clinicians often do not identify or misdiagnose cases of delirium individuals; hypoactive delirium presenting with lethargy, confusion, and indifference to the environment is the most difficult to diagnose subtype, despite being the most commonly occurring type in elderly adults.3 An 87-year-old woman was brought to the geriatric department because of forgetfulness (not recognizing her children), being introverted, distractibility, indifference to the environment, lack of appetite, refusal to take medications, and hallucinations such as seeing her deceased husband in the room for the previous 2 days. She had no known cognitive deficiency. Physical examination showed a heart rate of 102 beats per minute, respiration rate of 18 breaths per minute, and a body temperature of 37.4°C. All systemic examinations were normal. Assessment of mental condition revealed cognitive and perception problems with disturbances of memory and orientation. Psychomotor activity was found to be poor, and she gave short answers to questions during the interview and refused to talk. Based on these clinical findings and symptoms, the newly developed clinical picture was thought to be hypoactive delirium, and she was admitted to the geriatric service. Examination immediately after admission revealed a sinus rhythm electrocardiogram with no pathological characteristics. She had leukocytosis (13,000/μL). Biochemistry showed normal liver, thyroid, and kidney functions, with no electrolyte imbalance. Urinalysis showed no evidence of infection. No pneumonic consolidation or effusion was detected on chest X-ray. Brain tomography ordered to exclude cranial pathology due to acute mental alteration revealed no pathological findings. Sedimentation was 90 mm/h (normal <15 mm/h), C-reactive protein was 115 mg/L (normal 0.1–8.2 mg/L), and lumbar puncture performed to exclude aseptic meningitis and encephalitis was normal. On the fifth day, she was persistently encouraged to mobilize because she did not want to get out of bed and wished to sleep continuously, but she developed exertional dyspnea and syncope. D-dimer was 13,115 mg/L (normal 0–0.5 mg/L), so thoracic tomography was ordered. Filling defects at the main and segmental branches of the pulmonary arteries consistent with embolus were observed on both sides, being more prominent on the right side, and minimal pleural effusion was observed on the left side (Figure 1). Lower extremity venous Doppler ultrasonography findings were consistent with subacute deep vein thrombosis in the left lower extremity. She was started on 1 mg/kg of enoxaparin sodium twice daily, with the addition of warfarin on the third day. On the fifth day of anticoagulation therapy, the delirium was completely resolved, and she was discharged. During outpatient follow-up, warfarin treatment was regulated to maintain an international normalized ratio level of 2.5–3.5, and she developed no new delirium. Delirium is associated with poor functional capacity, likelihood of admission to a nursing home, mortality, morbidity, and admission to the hospital.4, 5 Hypoactive delirium is the most commonly encountered subtype in elderly adults. Unlike the other subtypes, individuals behave as if they are sedated and do not harm themselves or others; as a consequence, clinicians often do not identify such individuals or misdiagnose them with depression or dementia. Simple conditions such as untreated urinary system infection, constipation, and pain may cause delirium in elderly adults, although life-threatening conditions such as myocardial infarction and stroke can also cause it.6 Pulmonary embolus (PE) may not always cause typical symptoms as dyspnea; it is asymptomatic (32% of cases) or may present with atypical symptoms as acute confusion, chest and back pain, and syncope.7 Rarely, one of the atypical clinical presentations of PE may be delirium, as mentioned in this case report, and PE should be investigated in elderly adults presenting with delirium, even in the absence of typical symptoms. In conclusion, while assessing the etiology of delirium, clinicians should remember that one of the acute conditions leading to development of delirium is PE, particularly in elderly adults.

      "title": "Obstructive Sleep Apnea-Hypopnea Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is characterized by recurrent episodes of partial or complete upper airway collapse during sleep that is highlighted by a reduction in, or complete cessation of, airflow despite documented on going inspiratory efforts. Due to the lack of adequate alveolar ventilation that results from the upper airway narrowing, oxygen saturation may drop and partial pressure of CO2 may occasionally increase. The events are mostly terminated by arousals. Clinical consequences are excessive daytime sleepiness related to the sleep disruption. Minimal diagnostic criteria have been defined for OSAHS. Patients should have excessive daytime sleepiness that can not be better explained by other factors, or experience two or more of the following symptoms, again that are not better explained by other factors: choking or gasping during sleep; recurrent awakenings from sleep; un-refreshing sleep; daytime fatigue; and impaired concentration. All patients should have more than five obstructed breathing events per hour during sleep. An obstructive apnea or hypopnoea can be defined as an event that lasts for ≥ 10 s and is characterized by an absence or a decrease from baseline in the amplitude of a valid measure of breathing during sleep that either reaches >50% with an oxygen desaturation of 3% or an arousal (alternatively a 30% reduction with 4% desaturation). The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) recommends these definitions. The Task Force of the AASM also states that there are common pathogenic mechanisms for obstructive apnea syndrome, central apnea syndrome, sleep hypoventilation syndrome and Cheyne-Stokes breathing. It was more preferable to discuss each of these separately; although, they could be placed under the common denominator of \"sleep-disordered breathing syndrome\". The definition of OSAHS using two components, daytime symptoms and breathing pattern disturbances during sleep, may suggest that there is a tight correlation between the two. However, unfortunately this is not the case. The breathing pattern abnormalities, mostly described by an Apnea/Hypopnoea Index (AHI), only weakly correlate with quantified measures of sleepiness, such as the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). This probably means that interindividual sensitivity, with some individuals coping better with sleep fragmentation than others, does compromise the relationship between the AHI and daytime sleepiness scores. In addition, epidemiological studies show a broad range of sleepiness in the general population. Obviously, epidemiological studies investigating the prevalence of OSAHS are all biased by the lack of a uniform definition. The prevalence of an AHI of >5 events · h-1 in a general population (without taking into account symptoms of sleepiness) has previously been estimated to be 24% in a male population. When symptoms of sleepiness were also taken into account, the prevalence decreased to 4% in males and 2% in females.",

      "title": "Medications and Their Effects on Sleep",
      "abstract": "Abstract Many medications affect the central nervous system (CNS) and can alter the patterns of sleep and wakefulness. Others can induce sleep disorders (eg, nightmares, periodic limb movements of sleep or restless legs syndrome) or exacerbate them (eg, obstructive sleep apnea). Some agents can cause both insomnia and excessive sleepiness in different individuals, or in the same individual under different circumstances. These can be a primary therapeutic effect of the drug, a withdrawal effect, or an adverse reaction. Each medication possesses class and agent-specific effects on sleep. Alcohol’s effect on arousal and sleep is biphasic. Alcohol has both stimulatory effects (at low doses and on the rising phase of alcohol levels) and sedative effects (at high doses and on the falling phase of alcohol levels). Metabolism of alcohol occurs at a constant rate of 10 to 20 mg/dl per hour. Alcohol’s sedating effect can be additive with other agents such as benzodiazepines. Acute ingestion decreases sleep latency, increases non–rapid eye movement (NREM) stages 3 and 4 sleep, and reduces rapid eye movement (REM) sleep during the first half of the sleep period (Table 16–1). It is metabolized quickly, and alcohol causes a rebound increase in the frequency of arousals and awakenings and an increase in REM sleep during the second part of the night. Nightmares and vivid dreams can occur. In addition, alcohol ingestion can cause worsening of snoring and obstructive sleep apnea by increasing upper airway resistance due to a decrease in pharyngeal dilator muscle tone.",

Involuntary sound perception originating in the head Tinnitus can be caused by: Hearing loss Exposure to loud sounds Extreme stress or trauma Acoustic neuroma Injury to ears, neck or head and heart disease Neurophysiological models indicate the mechanism of tinnitus in an increase in spontaneous activity in the absence of acoustic stimuli. General notes on Tinnitus: 1- Any Tinnitus treatment must be used in connection with counseling and possible other treatment. 2- Tinnitus is a perception of involuntary sound. It must be audible to the person, it originates in the head (McFadden 1982). 3- It is most commonly referred to as ringing in the ears. 4- Produced centrally, with peripheral influences (e.g. Cochlear damage). Exact mechanism(s), or epidemiology is unknown. 5- Noise type can vary from pure tones over modulated noise to crackling sounds that varies significantly with time &amp; Large intensity variations. 6- Not a ‘phantom’ perception for the patient, it is real 7- Tinnitus can be described in many different forms, for example: Ringing, Chirping, Clicking, Pulsating, Continuous, Sudden A-Geriatric tinnitus Presby tinnitus, defined as tinnitus that accompanies the progressive hearing loss of presbycusis; is classified as: type 1 (normal aging affecting the cochlea), and type II (preexistent sensorineural hearing loss accompanied by multiple systemic complaints, especially of sensory ones). B-Pediatric tinnitus has an incidence of 13% in children who passed an audio metric screening test, and 23-60% in those with hearing loss, 44% in secretory otitis media, but only 3% complain spontaneously because that the child considers tinnitus to be a normal event. There is no significant difference between children with tinnitus and those without in terms of hearing level, age, gender, or etiology of the deafness. Despite the fact that often children do not mention it, tinnitus may incite behavioral problems.",

Psilocybin is considered to be a “classic psychedelic” and is most commonly found in the form of so-called “magic mushrooms”. Due to its unique properties psilocybin has been used during religious ceremonies and rituals for centuries and more recently also explored in a medical context. Nowadays many studies are being carried out to prove the efficacy of its use in the treatment of various psychiatric disorders. &#x0D; Aim of study: Review of the current knowledge on the subject of psilocybin applied in the treatment of psychiatric disorders, such as major depressive disorder, treatment-resistant depression and addiction.&#x0D; Methods and materials: A review of chosen literature was carried out in the PubMed database and Google Scholar using the following phrases: psilocybin, psychedelics, psychedelic-assisted therapy, major depressive disorder, addiction.&#x0D; Results: Recent studies suggest that psilocybin may be an effective form of treatment for cancer-related psychiatric distress, treatment-resistant depression and addiction. There are some reports of psilocybin being useful when treating obsessive-compulsive disorder and cluster headaches.&#x0D; Conclusions: More large-scale, randomized, placebo-controlled studies are required to prove these promising findings.

      "abstract": "Insomnia is a disorder characterized by chronic sleep disturbance associated with daytime disability or distress, such as memory impairment and fatigue, that occurs despite adequate opportunity for sleep. Insomnia may present as difficulty falling/staying asleep or as sleep that is nonrestorative. Studies show a strong correlation between insomnia and impaired quality of life. Pain conditions and depression are commonly associated with insomnia, either as secondary or comorbid conditions. In addition, a greater incidence of anxiety, alcohol and drug dependence, and cardiovascular disease is found in people with insomnia. Data indicate insomnia results from over-engaged arousal systems. Insomnia patients experience increased metabolic rate, body temperature, and heart rate, and elevated levels of norepinephrine and catecholamines. Pharmacologic options for the treatment of insomnia include benzodiazepine hypnotics, a selective melatonin receptor agonist, and sedating antidepressants. However, insomnia may be best treated with cognitive-behavioral therapy and instruction in good sleep hygiene, either alone or in concert with pharmacologic agents. Studies on the effects of insomnia treatment use variable methodologies or do not publish negative results, and there are currently no studies of treatment focusing on morbidity. Further research is necessary to better understand the effects of insomnia therapies on medical and psychiatric disorders. In this Clinical Information Supplement, Thomas Roth, PhD, describes the nature of insomnia and its pathophysiology. Next, Andrew D. Krystal, MD, MS, reviews morbidities associated with insomnia. Finally, Joseph A. Lieberman III, MD, MPH, provides an overview of therapeutics utilized in patients with insomnia, including behavioral therapies and pharmacologic options.",

Insomnia may appear with different presentations: sleep onset, sleep maintenances, sleep offset, nonrestorative sleep, or a combination of these symptoms. Untreated symptoms result in clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of following-day functionality. Physicians, pharmacists, and other clinicians should be aware of the conditions that contribute to, are antecedent to, and associated with insomnia. These pathophysiological conditions include advanced age; female gender; respiratory, gastrointestinal, vascular, and rheumatologic pain syndromes; and other conditions such as depression and/or anxiety. Additional health factors contributing to insomnia include chronic pain, stressors, grief reaction, pharmacotherapeutic side effects, lifestyle contributors such as social/recreational drugs, phytopharmaceuticals, and ethanol use. The pharmacotherapy focus in this article is a modified-release formulation of the BZ1 (omega1) receptor agonist zolpidem, zolpidem extended-release. Pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and safety studies that compare 12.5 mg zolpidem extended-release (Ambien CR™CIV) and 10 mg original zolpidem were initially conducted in healthy volunteers to assess the potential for an improved clinical profile. Zolpidem extended-release (12.5 mg and 6.25 mg extended-release dosage forms) is indicated for the treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulties with sleep onset and/or sleep maintenance. Zolpidem extended-release is devoid of any short-term use limitation and can be prescribed for the duration of medical necessity. The modified-release zolpidem is a two-layer tablet with a biphasic release profile, releasing the first layer immediately, whereas the second layer is released at a slower rate. Plasma concentrations are maintained for a longer period of time versus the immediate-release zolpidem formulation. Pharmacokinetic analysis has also demonstrated that the time to maximum concentration (tmax) and terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) of 12.5 mg zolpidem extended-release are similar to those of 10 mg zolpidem indicating a similar rapid onset of action and an elimination profile that reduced the risk of next-day decrements in performance. Zolpidem's CYP 450 hepatic metabolism uses as a substrate CYP3A4 (major) and 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, and 2D6 as minor pathways. Zolpidem extended-release dosage forms diminish sleep latency, number of awakenings, and wakefulness after sleep onset and augments total time asleep.",

The nosology of anxiety.Anxiety is phenomenologically defined as a state experienced as fear or tension dependent on whether psychic or somatic manifestations prevail. Primary anxiety is initial and dominant, whereas secondary anxiety is secondary to and less prominent than other symptoms. Primary anxiety may be rational or irrational, dependent on whether the background is apparent or not for the individual. Irrational anxiety may be somatogenic or neurotic. Neurotic anxiety may appear as free-floating, focal, or transformed into other symptoms. Free-floating neurotic anxiety constitutes anxiety neurosis that is divided into panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. Panic attacks are characteristic of panic disorder and may give rise to a sequential development of anticipatory anxiety, agoraphobia, secondary depression, and abuse of alcohol and anxiolytic drugs. Depersonalization/derealization and hyperventilation may dominate the picture in some cases. Both forms of anxiety neurosis may show muscular tension and vegetative symptoms and hypochondria may be superposed.",

This ‘extra’ which complements the infantilism of hysteria, are determined by the following constellation of factors: (1) an immature, underdeveloped, emotional personality with a feeble identity; (2) due to the relatively great need for warding off emotional influences, the personality is more vulnerable to emotional stress; (3) a predisposition to deficient repression, leading to insufficient mental defence; (4) an auxiliary auto-regulation in the form of states of lowered consciousness and convulsions or fits, to keep the overwhelming emotional influences outside his awareness. Freud elucidated the dynamic relationships in an impressive way; he described all that can be called neurotic in hysteria.

The interview not only is diagnostic, but it can also be therapeutic. Use open-ended questions, such as, “Tell me about your headaches,” “Tell me in your own words how headaches affect your life,” or “What else can you tell me about your headaches?” After presenting the patient with a list of therapeutic options described here, always ask, “What do you think about these options? Do you have any questions about them? And which ones do you want to pursue?” Establishing the correct diagnosis is not a one-time event but rather an ongoing process. Not having a biological marker or a test for primary headaches and relying on the clinical picture for diagnosis require constant vigilance and reappraisal, particularly when headaches change in character or worsen in severity or frequency. A migraine sufferer may develop other conditions, such as hypothyroidism, brain tumor, cervicogenic headaches, or magnesium deficiency, which in the beginning may only worsen the typical migraines without any additional signs and symptoms. Typical migraine, tension, or cluster headaches have been reported to occur with the majority of intracranial pathologies, such as vascular abnormalities, tumors, and infections.",

También está enlazado a la salud integral, un desorden en su patrón o calidad conduce al cambio en el estado de ánimo; el insomnio es el más prevalente y se define como “dificultad persistente en el inicio del sueño que ocurre a pesar de adecuadas oportunidades para el mismo” De la misma forma, los problemas de menoscabo de sueño se han relacionado con trastornos de ansiedad y depresión en la población, es por ello como destaca “la depresión es un trastorno mental que se caracteriza por tristeza, perdida de interés o placer acompañados de sentimientos de culpa o autoestima baja, alteraciones del sueño o del apetito, fatiga y falta de concentración”. De la misma manera define la ansiedad como “la anticipación temerosa de peligro inminente acompañada de un sentimiento intenso en cualquier región geográfica corporal, implicando un presentimiento de que algo grave le va a pasar”. Los problemas de deterioro de sueño se han relacionado con trastornos de ansiedad y depresión, es por ello como destaca “la depresión es un trastorno mental que se caracteriza por tristeza, culpabilidad, autoestima baja, alteraciones del sueño o del apetito, fatiga y falta de concentración”. Conforme NANDA Esta investigación tiene como objetivo analizar el deterioro del patrón del sueño en los estudiantes de enfermería de la facultad Ciencias de la Salud de la Universidad Técnica de Ambato. Objetivos Determinar el deterioro del patrón del sueño en os estudiantes de enfermería según NANDA Método La presente investigación es de carácter cuantitativo, no experimental, descriptivo y transversal. Utiliza la recolección de datos con la aplicación de la encuesta del Índice de Calidad de Sueño de Pittsburg sobre la calidad de sueño en su versión en español contando con un alfa de Cronbach del 0.84 garantizando su fiabilidad, es así que la encuesta cuenta con 19 preguntas autoevaluadas y 5 preguntas evaluadas por el acompañante de habitación del paciente si está disponible, en donde los componentes son: calidad subjetiva del sueño, latencia del sueño, duración del sueño, eficiencia del sueño, alteraciones del sueño, uso de medicamentos para dormir y disfunción diurna. La puntuación de cada componente es de 0 al 3, donde 0 es muy bueno y 3 muy malo, solo las preguntas auto aplicadas están incluidas en este puntaje aplicándose en 78 estudiantes de enfermería y su posterior análisis en Excel e IBM SPSS 25. Principales resultados Al enfocarnos en los siete componentes del índice de calidad de sueño de Pittsburg: 1. Calidad subjetiva del sueño: 42,3% de los sujetos de estudio tienen una mala calidad subjetiva del sueño. 2. Latencia de sueño: 41% presentó sensación de dificultad para dormir por lo menos una vez a la semana. 3. Duración del dormir: 6 a 7 horas en un 33,3% es la duración promedio del sueño de la mayoría de los sujetos de estudio es 4. Eficiencia de sueño: 59% de los estudiantes de enfermería tienen una eficiencia del sueño mayor al 85%. 5. Perturbaciones del sueño: 61,5% tiene perturbaciones en el sueño por lo menos una vez a la semana. 6. Uso de medicamentos para dormir: 82,1% de los refieren que no ha tomado medicina para dormir en ninguna ocasión en el último mes. 7. Disfunción diurna: 44,9% de los sujetos de estudio ha tenido disfunción diurna del sueño por lo menos una vez a la semana mientras. Conclusiones En la presente investigación se concluye que los estudiantes de enfermería del ciclo académico octubre 2022 – marzo 2023 de la Universidad Técnica de Ambato presentan deterioro en el patrón del sueño con pocas horas de descanso, interrupción entre el mismo y acompañado de somnolencia; trayendo como consecuencias un leve problema en su energía para realizar actividades cotidianas. A su vez los participantes tienen una dificultad para dormir, problemática que podría acogerse a la automedicación, dado que en el presente estudio si se obtuvo resultados de toma de medicación para dormir y más en personas divorciadas y del género masculino, pudiendo así causar fármaco dependencia en un futuro o el inicio de automedicación de los estudiantes de enfermería.",

      "abstract": "![][1]</img> This article is part of a new initiative in Evidence-based Mental Health, namely the serialisation of chapters of Clinical Evidence (a summary of the best available evidence on common clinical interventions updated regularly by the BMJ Publishing Group). This article is based on material presented in: Kumar S, Oakley-Browne M. Panic disorder. Clinical Evidence 2002; 8: 1003–9. For this review, Clinical Evidence searched and appraised material published until May 2002. Studies with follow up periods of less than 6 months were excluded. A panic attack is a period in which there is sudden onset of intense apprehension, fearfulness or terror, often associated with feelings of impending doom. Panic disorder occurs when there are recurrent, unpredictable attacks followed by at least 1 month of persistent concern about having another panic attack; worry about the possible implications or consequences of the panic attacks, or a significant behavioural change related to the attacks.1 The term “panic disorder” excludes panic attacks attributable to the direct physiological effects of a general medical condition, substance or another mental disorder. Panic disorder is sometimes categorised as “with” or “without agoraphobia.”1 Alternative categorisations focus on phobic anxiety disorders and specify agoraphobia with or without panic disorder.2 Panic disorder often starts around 20 years of age (between late adolescence and the mid-30s).3 Lifetime prevalence is 1–3%, and panic disorder is more common in women than in men.4 An Australian community study found 1 month prevalence rates for panic disorder (with or without agoraphobia) of 0.4% using International Classification of … [1]: /embed/graphic-1.gif",

Patients suffering primarily from migraine or headache caused by tension are susceptible to this affect due to their massive consumption of medication. The frequent or daily intake of painkillers or migraine medication over periods of weeks or months may lead to a new type of headache characterised by dull, pressure-like and diffuse permanent pain. The appropriate therapy in this case is a withdrawal of analgesics, for which the patient needs to be hospitalised. The recovery process after hospitalisation depends heavily on the after treatment. Factors for a favourable prognosis are the length of the abuse period (less than 5 years), the use of dihydergot as a pain-killer, motivation of the patient and the support of the family and the patient's immediate environment.",

Marijuana users may experience relaxation, euphoria, and mild hallucinogenic effects. Some may experience nausea and vomiting after using marijuana; synthetic cannabinoids have been associated with more serious complications. Regular users may experience drug craving, insomnia, anorexia, and restlessness with cessation of use. Serious medical complications are uncommon; the most concerning are neuropsychological problems among adolescent users, and acute cognitive and motor impairment. Psychosocial modalities appear to help those who wish to stop or cut down on use. There are no medications that have been shown to be effective for cannabinoid use disorders.",

Evidentemente en la practica clinica es deseable modificar un estado de animo con el proposito de aliviar la ansiedad generalizada, la depresion o un trastorno obsesivo compulsivo, por citar solo algunos ejemplos. Uno de los grandes logros de la medicina moderna es haber desarrollado farmacos eficaces para el tratamiento de diversos trastornos de animo con lo cual la calidad de vida de un gran numero de personas se ha incrementado notablemente. Gracias a este avance trastornos que en el pasado eran incapacitantes y requerian hospitalizacion pueden ser tratados en consulta externa con muy buenos resultados. Esto ha sido posible por la investigacion clinica y cientifica que ha llevado al desarrollo de nuevas moleculas, de diversas formas farmaceuticas y de regimenes de dosificacion apropiados para el tratamiento de distintos trastornos. Dentro de las sustancias psicoactivas no solo se encuentran las medicinas que controlan los trastornos del estado de animo, del sueno o de la ansiedad, sino las drogas de abuso, llamadas asi por su alta capacidad para producir adiccion. La experiencia indica que hay que ser cauteloso con los compuestos que conforman esta categoria ya que su consumo conlleva el riesgo de perder el control sobre la cantidad ingerida, con las consecuencias negativas asociadas para el sujeto y la sociedad. ?En que consisten las diferencias entre las medicinas psicoactivas y las drogas de abuso? La respuesta a esta pregunta es compleja y requiere tener en cuenta que los efectos de los farmacos dependen no solo de sus mecanismos particulares de accion sino de las condiciones de las personas que los consumen, del regimen de dosificacion (cuanto y cuando se toma), de la forma farmaceutica (pastilla, tableta dispersable, jarabe, ampolleta para inyeccion, parche de liberacion prolongada, etc.) y de la via de administracion. Por eso, una misma sustancia puede ser muy util cuando se usa de manera controlada en un hospital y muy peligrosa cuando se vende en el mercado negro como droga.

      "abstract": "Abstract Medical treatment of the addictions remains controversial, with addiction itself viewed as a lifestyle problem, a hijacking of brain systems by drugs, or as a medical illness. Many of these controversies may be avoided by taking a goal-oriented approach to treatment, in which clinical objectives are defined, and both medications and psychological interventions are used to facilitate progress towards these. The effectiveness of medications is maximized when they are used as one component of a comprehensive treatment plan. There are no ‘magic bullets’ in addiction treatment—the same pharmacological principles apply to these drug treatments as to any other. Drugs need to be given in effective doses, at appropriate intervals, allowed time to reach steady state, and also to dissipate when terminated on the basis of their half-life. Some drugs also have an abuse potential of their own (e.g. opiates, sedative-hypnotics) especially those with a rapid onset of action, and such drugs need to be particularly closely monitored and controlled, to minimize their diversion and misuse.",

      "abstract": "Although Parkinson's disease (PD) is diagnosed on the basis of motor symptoms, including slowness of movement, tremor, rigidity and difficulties with balance and walking, now we are aware that non-motor symptoms are highly prevalent, since they can anticipate motor symptoms and can cause severe consequences. Several studies have shown that non-motor symptoms, such as depression, anxiety and apathy, psychosis (e.g., hallucinations, delusions), sleep disturbance, and pain may have a greater adverse impact on quality of life and health economics compared with motor symptoms. Non-motor symptoms can be divided into four domains: neuropsychiatric (e.g., depression, anxiety, apathy, hallucinations, dementia), autonomic (e.g., constipation, orthostatic hypotension, urinary changes, sweating abnormalities), sleep (e.g., insomnia, sleep fragmentation, excessive daytime sleepiness, rapid eye movement, sleep behavioural disorder, restless leg syndrome), and sensory dysfunction (e.g., pain, olfactory dysfunction). This review addresses diagnosis and treatment of these disorders. The causative mechanisms remain complex, since they reflect the widespread brainstem and cortical pathology of PD, with involvement of several neurotransmitters, including dopamine (DA), serotonin, norepinephrine, and acetylcholine. The diagnosis is often challenging, especially for psychiatric disorders, and in particular affective disorders, because somatic features of psychopathology may overlap with the movement disorder itself. Treatments used are limited and psychiatric drugs may not be as effective as in general population. Evidence based medicine is quite poor and it still requires well-designed clinical studies.",

      "title": "Epilepsy and Seizures",
      "abstract": "For more than a century, clinicians have observed a strong link between epilepsy and psychiatry as evidenced by frequent psychopathologies, psychosocial disturbances, and cognitive deficits among people with epilepsy. In many countries, until recently, epilepsy was conceptualized as a mental health disorder. Epilepsy can be associated not only with episodic behavioral disorders ictally and during the peri-ictal period but also with chronic behavioral disturbances interictally. Indeed, even when optimal seizure control is achieved and cognitive impairment is absent, epidemiological studies have shown greater vulnerability of people with epilepsy toward psychosocial distress (Sillanpää et al. 1998). A wide variety of etiologies affecting the central nervous system (CNS) can involve very similar behavioral signs and symptoms (Table 10–1 ). Primary signs and symptoms of central nervous system disturbances Cognitive Affective dysregulation Communication/language dysfunction Intellectual impairment Impaired judgment Dysmnesia/inattention Disorientation Behavioral Anxiety Alteration in arousal Mood (elevation, depression, apathy) Motor (hyperkinetic, hypokinetic, or akinetic) Personality traits/changes Dyspraxia Perceptions Auditory Gustatory Kinesthetic pain/paresthesias/anesthesia Olfactory Visual Source. Adapted from Tucker 2002, p. 674. In this chapter, we first provide an overview of the evaluation and management of epilepsy, focusing on the diverse neurobehavioral manifestations of seizures as influenced by seizure origin and extent of electrical propagation. In subsequent sections, we review the evaluation and management of the more common neuropsychiatric complications and comorbidities of the epilepsies and seizures.",

      "title": "Change In Mental Status",
      "abstract": "The evaluation and management of altered mental status are broad and require careful history and physical examination to eliminate life-threatening situations. Changes in consciousness can be categorized into changes of arousal, the content of consciousness, or a combination of both. Arousal includes wakefulness and/or alertness and can be described as hypoactivity or hyperactivity, while changes in the content of consciousness can lead to changes in self-awareness, expression, language, and emotions .Changes in mental status can be described as delirium (acute change in arousal and content), depression (chronic change in arousal), dementia (chronic change in arousal and content), and coma (dysfunction of arousal and content) . Delirium is typically an acute confusional state, defined by impairment of attention or cognition that usually develops over hours to days. Some patients may experience rapid fluctuations between hypoactive and hyperactive states, that may be interjected with periods of intermittent lucidity. A nearly pathognomonic characteristic of delirium is sleep-wake cycle disruption, which leads to “sundowning,” a phenomenon in which delirium becomes worse or more persistent at night .Depression is characterized by personal withdrawal, slowed speech, or poor results of a cognitive test. Patients rarely have a rapid fluctuation of symptoms and are usually oriented and able to follow commands . Dementia is a slow, progressive loss of mental capacity, leading to deterioration of cognitive abilities and behavior. There are multiple types of dementia, but the most common are idiopathic (also referred to as Alzheimer disease) and vascular dementia. Idiopathic dementia is defined by the slow impairment of recent memory and orientation with remote memories and motor and speech abilities preserved. As the disease progresses, patients exhibit decreased performance in social situations, the inability to self-care, and changes in personality. Vascular dementia is similar to Alzheimer disease, although patients may have signs of motor abnormalities in addition to cognitive changes, and may exhibit a fluctuating step-wise decline, as multiple vascular events have an additive effect on the patient’s function .Coma is a complete dysfunction of the arousal system, in which patients do not respond to basic stimuli but often retain brain stem reflexes .",

      "title": "The Explosion of a New Designer Drug, Flakka",
      "abstract": "There are many challenges facing healthcare professionals. One such challenge is the continuous introduction of new synthetic drugs. Synthetic drugs pose many difficulties to providers, including identification of the drug ingested, management of symptoms, ensuring safety of the patient and his or her environment, and continual monitoring after the initial symptoms, because synthetic cathinones have many long-term effects on an individual. One such synthetic drug, flakka, is a potent second-generation synthetic cathinone. Because flakka inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine and dopamine, which are involved in one's perception of pleasure, it causes inflated feelings and also causes signs and symptoms of psychosis. Flakka also induces various exaggerated symptoms, such as feelings of incredible strength, disorientation, aggression, and altered thought processes, and also can cause hyperthermia, coma, and death. Healthcare professionals need to understand the nature of flakka ingestion, the various symptoms a user may exhibit, and the long-term symptoms a person may have once the acute recovery phase has ended. Once the initial phase of ingestion is over and the patient is medically stabilized, the patient may experience signs and symptoms of psychosis or other psychiatric disorders. It is paramount that healthcare professionals are able to recognize the signs and symptoms of flakka ingestion, know the steps to take to ensure safety of the patient and those around him or her, and also know how to facilitate the patient's recovery.",

      "abstract": "The alcohol withdrawal syndrome occurs in the hours or days after the cessation of alcohol drinking in an alcohol dependent patient. The alcohol withdrawal syndrome is produced by the emergence of the biological mechanism of neurological tolerance to ethanol. The clinical manifestations of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome are due to the hyperexcitability of the central nervous system: agitation, excitability, tremor, convulsions, status epilepticus, delirium, sympathetic hyperactivity. Usually benign, the alcohol withdrawal syndrome is frequently manageable on an ambulatory basis, as long as no clinical counter-indication is present such as a serious previous alcohol withdrawal syndrome, previous withdrawal convulsions, a significant medical or psychiatric comorbidity, a high level of alcohol consumption, a pregnancy, or the lack of an effective familial or social support. The ambulatory management of the alcohol withdrawal syndrome requires frequently the use of a sedative drug. Benzodiazepines used orally for a duration of 3 to 5 days are actually considered a first choice. Inability to work and drive is frequently present for several days.",

      "title": "Hipoglikemijski sindromi - dijagnostički i terapijski pristup i prikaz dva slučaja",
      "abstract": "Prevention of hypoglycemia is essential for preservation of brain metabolism and survival of the whole body. Normally, glucose is only substrate used by the brain to meet its metabolic requirements. When plasma glucose concentration decreases (e.g., during prolonged fasting or after administration of glucose-lowering drugs) several physiological responses are activated to prevent further decreases in blood glucose. The first response is known as counterregulation, a system that prevents and corrects hypoglycemia through the release of counterregulatory hormones. Ultimately traceable to neural glucose deprivation, symptoms of hypoglycemia include neurogenic (autonomic) and neuroglycopenic symptoms. Neurogenic symptoms (tremulousness, palpitations, anxiety, sweating, hunger, and paresthesias) are results of the perception of physiologic changes caused by the autonomic nervous system’s response to hypoglycemia. Neuroglycopenic symptoms (confusion, sensation of warmth, weakness or fatigue, severe cognitive failure, seizure, coma) are the results of brain glucose deprivation itself. Glycemic thresholds for symptoms of hypoglycemia shift to lower plasma glucose concentrations following recent episodes of hypoglycemia, leading to the syndrome of hypoglycemia unawareness-loss of warming symptoms of developing hypoglycemia. Thus, patients with recurrent hypoglycemia (e.g. those with tightly controlled diabetes or with an insulinoma) often tolerate abnormal low plasma glucose concentration without symptoms. Classification of symptoms of hypoglycemia, namely reactive versus fasting based on segregation by timing in relation to meals is no longer useful from a clinical point of view. Every patient with neuroglycopenic symptoms regardless of relation to food ingestion, requires comprehensive evaluation. Identification of the possible cause of hypoglycemia and selection of diagnostic modalities are facilitated by considering whether the patients appears to be healthy (with or without compensated coexistent disease) or ill (with a disease known to have a proclivity to develop hypoglycemia, or is hospitalized). Medications may mediate hypoglycemia in anybody, whether they appear healthy or ill. Optimal condition for confirming the presence and accurately diagnosing the type of hypoglycemic disorder occurs at the time of spontaneous spell. Otherwise, dynamic testing to generate conductive conditions should be conducted in any patients with a history of neuroglycopenic symptoms, regardless of relation to meal ingestion. Specific criteria regarding beta-cell polypeptide concentrations are required to establish hyperinsulinemia. Sulfonylureas in plasma should be measured with sensitive assays. Surgical management of insulinoma begins with simply considering the diagnosis then proceeding to establish absolutely the biochemical diagnosis.",

Es lo que tambien ha sido llamado paranoia, termino acunado por Hipocrates aunque el significado dado entonces era bien distinto al que la psiquiatria alemana redefinio dandole un sentido muy concreto y restringido para designar un trastorno que Kraepelin, conceptuo como un cuadro delirante cronico que cursa sin deterioro ni alucinaciones (excepto las asociadas al tema delirante). Este contraste entre la probada realidad deficiente de un area de la vida mental y la evidente normalidad en muchas otras del paciente, se refleja en el criterio C del DSM-5 y comentado por las personas que cuidan de estos pacientes, como a pesar de estar evidentemente confundidos, parece que en todo lo demas son basicamente normales (Kendler K. , 2012) Este fenomeno, al que ha acompanado una diversa sinonimia a lo largo de su historia, tal como paranoia vera, estado paranoide, delirio monosintomatico, enfermedad delirante, monomania, locura delirante cronica, parafrenia, entre otras, (Winokur, 1977). Hasta la llegada de los consensuados sistemas de Clasificacion de Enfermedades, tales como la Clasificacion Internacional de Enfermedades y la familia DSM, Clasificacion de Enfermedades Mentales en sus siglas inglesas. Ambas han permitido un sistema de nosografia que es revisable periodicamente a la luz de las nuevas evidencias cientificas, a la vez que abren nuevas lineas de investigacion por donde continuar avanzando.\r\n En la actualidad el fenomeno paranoia es una entidad clinica conocida como Trastorno Delirante (en adelante TD). Existen escasos estudios epidemiologicos sistematizados con criterios DSM en la literatura especializada del TD, quizas sea debido a su baja prevalencia a lo largo de la vida, que esta alrededor del 0,2% (APA, DSM.5, 2014).\r\n La controversia siempre ha acompanado al TD a lo largo de su historia, en ocasiones asimilado en el grupo de las esquizofrenias o de las demencias. La llegada del DSM-III (1987) con la denominacion de paranoia, incluyendolo en los trastornos paranoides no debidos a enfermedad organica, le otorgo nuevamente una entidad clinica perfilada (Dowbiggin, 2012), (Berrios G. , 2009).\r\n En este estudio conoceremos la evolucion historica del termino, los sintomas que lo constituyen y ahondaremos en los distintos subtipos clinicos que le caracterizan. Nuestra revision se complementa con los resultados de un estudio de 261 casos procedentes de un Registro de Casos, que sin duda contribuira al conocimiento de este poco estudiado Trastorno.",

      "abstract": "Serotonin syndrome is a potentially life-threatening condition caused by excessive serotonin activity in the central and peripheral nervous systems that can lead to symptoms such as altered mental status, autonomic instability (e.g., hyperthermia and hypertensive tachycardia), and neuromuscular abnormalities (e.g., clonus and tremor). We present the case of a 29-year-old male healthcare worker with a history of major depressive disorder (MDD), temporal lobe epilepsy, and suspected obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) who presented with sudden-onset agitation, confusion, and abnormal limb movements after his third consecutive 12-hour overnight shift. He had been on stable outpatient doses of escitalopram 20 mg and bupropion XL 150 mg daily for over six months, with naltrexone 50 mg added three months earlier for off-label psychiatric use. In the emergency department, he was treated for presumed seizure or psychosis with multiple sedatives and antipsychotics and subsequently intubated. EEG showed no epileptiform activity, and lumbar puncture was unremarkable. Neurologic findings, including hyperreflexia, clonus, and rigidity, along with rapid clinical improvement following cyproheptadine and benzodiazepines, supported a diagnosis of serotonin syndrome. The patient denied overdose or substance use, and toxicology review concluded that polypharmacy with serotonergic and modulating agents was the likely trigger. We present a young adult who developed serotonin syndrome without overdose, likely due to the cumulative serotonergic effect of multiple prescribed medications at therapeutic doses. This case emphasizes the importance of clinical vigilance in patients with neuropsychiatric comorbidities on centrally acting agents, even in the absence of recent medication changes. It illustrates that even therapeutic combinations of serotonergic and modulating agents can precipitate life-threatening toxicity.",

      "abstract": "There is a worse prognosis for psychosis and schizophrenia when onset is in childhood or adolescence. However, outcomes are improved with early detection and treatment. Psychotic symptoms can be associated with a variety of disorders including schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, drug-induced psychosis, personality disorder, epilepsy and autistic spectrum disorder. Positive symptoms include hallucinations and delusions. Negative symptoms include apathy, lack of drive, poverty of speech, social withdrawal and self-neglect. The DSM IV criteria for schizophrenia include two or more of the following: hallucinations, delusions, disorganised speech, grossly disorganised or catatonic behaviour and negative symptoms. Adults may raise concerns about social withdrawal, bizarre ideas, a change in behaviour or a decline in achievement. Most children and young people with psychotic symptoms will not go on to develop psychosis or schizophrenia. Direct enquiry may be needed to elicit suspected unusual beliefs or hallucinations. To distinguish unusual ideas from delusions the ideas should be tested for fixity. For example by asking: 'Are you sure? Could there be another explanation?' Mood and anxiety symptoms should be explored. The assessment should include a developmental history with particular attention to premorbid functioning. Failure to make expected progress whether personal, social or academic is significant. Better outcomes in terms of symptoms and social function are associated with a shorter duration of untreated psychosis. The detection of psychotic symptoms in primary care therefore warrants an urgent referral to secondary care mental health services for assessment and treatment.",

Brain focal lesions may threaten this certitude in two ways: 1) brain lesions result in deficiency, disability or handicap, which are experienced as a narcissistic injury. The patient questions himself about the image he offers to the Other's look, and, as a result, his sense of personal identity is unsettled; 2) a variety of focal brain lesions or dysfunctions may alter the activity of areas which are necessary for maintaining a stable image of the patients' body or self. This may lead patients to experience depersonalisation, autoscopy, somatoparaphrenic \"delusions\" or disturbed agency. The sense of personal identity may be disturbed during brief paroxystic or psychologically traumatic phenomena. However, this is not observed in chronic sequelae of brain lesions (e.g. right hemisphere syndrome or amnesic syndrome), even though the patients may present a broken up image of themselves.",

      "title": "Is Disordered Thinking Unique to Schizophrenia?",
      "abstract": "• To provide data on several issues related to disordered thinking in schizophrenia, 200 acutely ill psychiatric patients (including 55 schizophrenics) were evaluated on four instruments to assess thought pathology (the Object Sorting Test, the Rorschach Test, a social comprehension test, and a proverbs test). Patients were assessed at two phases of their disorders (the acute phase and the phase of partial recovery). The results suggest (1) disordered thinking is not unique to schizophrenia; (2) distinctions between mild and severe levels of thought pathology are important; and (3) disordered thinking is influenced by acute psychopathology and acute upset. Inferential evidence suggests (4) disordered thinking fits along a continuum with normal thinking; (5) \"thought disorders\" are not a discrete, separate entity, standing apart from other aspects of thinking; and (6) older concepts about primary symptoms in schizophrenia need reexamination.",

Sympathetic hyperactivity manifests with hypertension, tachyarrhythmias, hyperhidrosis, peripheral vasoconstriction, and hyperthermia or hypothermia.Massive sympathoexcitation can lead to intracranial hemorrhage, vasogenic brain edema, congestive heart failure, apical ballooning (Takotsubo) syndrome, and neurogenic pulmonary edema. Less commonly, autonomic hyperactivity also involves the parasympathetic system and manifests primarily with bradyarrhythmia or even syncope. Common causes of autonomic hyperactivity are head trauma, hypoxic brain injury, subarachnoid hemorrhage, autonomic dysreflexia in spinal cord injury, Guillain-Barré syndrome,and iatrogenic disorders such as neuroleptic malignant syndrome and serotonin syndrome.Autonomic hyperactivity in the setting of cognitive, psychiatric or sleep disturbances suggests alcohol (or other depressant drug) withdrawal, fatal insomnia, or limbic encephalitis. Patients with autonomic hyperactivity should be managed in an intensive care unit as they require continuous monitoring of cardiac rhythm, blood pressure, respiration, and fluid balance.",

It is associated with loss of hypocretin (orexin) neurons in the hypothalamus, hypocretin concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid below 110 pg/ml, and the HLA genotype DQ B1*0602. A less common form of narcolepsy without cataplexy probably has a different, as yet unknown, pathogenesis. Once established, narcolepsy is lifelong; spontaneous recovery does not occur. Symptomatic treatment—which is essential for school performance, work, driving ability, and quality of life—is with stimulant (e.g. amphetamine) and anticataplectic (e.g. clomipramine) drugs. More recently, sodium oxybate, an anaesthetic, has been used to induce deep sleep overnight, resulting in improvements in all symptoms.",

      "title": "Akathisia: Is Restlessness a Primary Condition or an Adverse Drug Effect? Keep a Discerning Eye out for This Adverse Effect of Antipsychotics and Other Drugs",
      "abstract": "Akathisia--from the Greek for inability to sit--is a neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by subjective and objective psychomotor restlessness. Patients typically experience feelings of unease, inner restlessness mainly involving the legs, and a compulsion to move. Most engage in repetitive movement. They might swing or cross and uncross their legs, shift from one foot to the other, continuously pace, or persistently fidget. In clinical settings, akathisia usually is a side effect of medication. Antipsychotics, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and buspirone are common triggers, but akathisia also has been associated with some antiemetics, preoperative sedatives, calcium channel blockers, and antivertigo agents. It also can be caused by withdrawal from an antipsychotic or related to a substance use disorder, especially cocaine. Akathisia can be acute or chronic, occurring in a tardive form with symptoms that last >6 months. (1,3) Much isn't known about drug-induced akathisia Our understanding of the pathophysiology of akathisia is incomplete. Some have suggested that it results from an imbalance between the dopaminergic/cholinergic and dopaminergic/ serotonergic systems (4); others, that the cause is a mismatch between the core and the shell of the nucleus accumbens, due in part to overstimulation of the locus ceruleus. (5) More recently, researchers established a positive association between higher scores on the Liverpool University Neuroleptic Side Effects Rating Scale and D2/D3 receptor occupancy in the ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercle). (6) The D2/D3 receptor occupancy model might explain withdrawal symptoms associated with cocaine/ as well as relative worsening of symptoms after tapering or discontinuing stimulants in attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Elements of a clinical evaluation When akathisia is suspected, evaluation by a clinician familiar with its phenomenology is crucial. A validated tool, such as the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (at out cometracker.org/library/BAS.pdf) can aid in the detection and assessment of severity. (8) In evaluating patients, keep in mind that the inner restlessness that characterizes akathisia can affect the trunk, hands, and arms, as well as the legs, and can cause dysphoria and anxiety. Akathisia has been linked to an increased likelihood of developing suicidal ideation and behavior. (9) Less common subjective symptoms include rage, fear, nausea, and worsening of psychotic symptoms. Because of its association with aggression and agitation, drug-induced akathisia has been cited--with little success--as the basis for an insanity defense by people who have committed a violent act. (10) Or is akathisia another psychiatric disorder? Akathisia might go undetected for several reasons. One key factor: Its symptoms resemble and often overlap with those of other psychiatric disorders, such as mania, psychosis, agitated depression, and ADHD. In addition, akathisia often occurs concurrently with, and is masked by, akinesia, a common extrapyramidal side effect of many antipsychotics. Such patients might have the inner feeling of restlessness and urge to move but do not exhibit characteristic limb movements. In some cases, cognitive or intellectual limitations prevent patients from communicating the inner turmoil they feel. (11) Medication nonadherence further complicates the picture, sometimes prompting a clinician to increase the dosage of the drug that is causing akathisia (Box 1 (12)). Box 1 Think twice before increasing the dosage Patients who develop symptoms of akathisia sometimes stop taking their medication; this often results in psychiatric relapse. (12) In addition, symptoms of akathisia often mimic psychiatric symptoms and can be mistaken for worsening anxiety or psychosis; in such cases, a practitioner might increase the dosage of the agent that is causing akathisia, potentially leading to further deterioration of the clinical picture. …",

The major causes of excessive daytime sleepiness include pathologic abnormalities of the central nervous system, such as narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia; deficiencies in quality or quantity of sleep, such as those caused by sleep apnea and poor sleep hygiene; disturbances to the body's natural circadian rhythm, such as those caused by shift work or jet lag; and drugs, which can increase sleepiness either therapeutically or as a side effect. Determining the cause of daytime sleepiness is the first step in treating it. Setting appropriate and realistic treatment goals with the patient and initiating treatment are the next steps. Although the medications available to improve daytime wakefulness (e.g., amphetamines, methylphenidate, pemoline, and modafinil) are effective, they are not a substitute for sleep. Finally, timely follow-up is necessary to monitor treatment adherence, response, and side effects.",

An 18-year-old also initiating venlafaxine developed facial tics, tremors, and speech disturbance. Acute symptoms did not respond to diphenhydramine in either case, but resolved after atomoxetine and other medications were discontinued. Possible explanations include atypical atomoxetine effect, excess atomoxetine or metabolites due to poor metabolizer status (CYP 2D6 polymorphism/deficiency), a drug-drug interaction leading to elevated drug levels or to excess synaptic norepinephrine or dopamine. Serotonin syndrome is a possibility in the second case, but not the first. Clinicians should be aware of emergent dyskinesias when combining atomoxetine with dopaminergic, noradrenergic, or serotonergic medications.",

Psychotic disorders in early adulthood are most frequently diagnosed with the schizophrenia spectrum or mood disorders. However, they may be the manifestation of neurologic, endocrine or immunologic disease. Individuals with NDD's such as the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or intellectual developmental disorder (IDD) may also present initially in adulthood. Therefore it is not uncommon that the psychiatrist is the first physician to assess a psychotic patient with underlying medical illness or a NDD. Failure to identify the underlying cause will delay appropriate management. Overdiagnosis of primary psychiatric disorders may be misleading in planning the treatment, as evidence-based treatment algorithms relevant to psychosis are intended for primary psychotic disorders like schizophrenia, and symptomatic treatment may result in unnecessary exposure to antipsychotic drugs. Exclusion of other medical conditions and NDD's is essential before establishing a diagnosis of schizophrenia.",

      "abstract": "Clozapine (Clozaril®, Sandoz, East Hanover, NJ), an atypical antipsychotic agent with pharmacological properties considerably different from standard neuroleptics, has been found to be of great benefit especially to patients with treatment-resistant psychotic disorders. However, it is these unique pharmacological properties that have also been associated with mul tiple side effects ranging from the relatively benign (ie, sialorrhea during sleep, dizziness) to the potentially fatal (ie, agranulocytosis, seizures, and respiratory depression) which have limited its use. These untoward side effects are particularly problematic in the elderly population who often have concomitant medi cal illnesses requiring multiple medication regimens, including psychotropics that may interact with cloza pine (ie, benzodiazepines, cimetidine, fluoxetine). Because even the most benign of side effects has the potential of becoming fatal in certain circumstances if left unaddressed, it is imperative for patients, clinicians, pharmacists, and all health care professionals to be aware of adverse reactions and possible complica tions of clozapine therapy to prevent significant morbidity and mortality.

      "title": "Vertigo",
      "abstract": "After completing this article, readers should be able to: “Dizziness” is a common complaint that implies a sense of disorientation, usually an altered perception of position in the environment. It may be due to lightheadedness or faintness (eg, the adolescent who has orthostatic hypotension), occur in association with a variety of acute medical disorders (eg, the febrile child who has vomiting and dehydration), or have a psychosomatic origin (eg, depression, anxiety, or exhaustion).Dizziness is formally classified into four categories: vertigo, presyncope, dysequilibrium, and light-headedness. Vertigo is defined as an illusion of movement, most often a sensation of rotation or, less frequently, linear displacement or tilt. Vertigo is the key symptom of vestibular pathology and usually the result of abnormalities of the labyrinth, although it also may be symptomatic of other neurologic disease (eg, seizures or migraines). It typically is accompanied by symptoms of varying degree, including nausea, vomiting, pallor, and perspiration. There is no loss of consciousness.The prevalence of vertigo in children is unknown. A recently published study of Scottish school children reported that 15% had experienced at least one episode of dizziness in a 1-year period. Almost 50% were assessed as having “paroxysmal vertigo” with accompanying symptoms frequently suggestive of migraine (pallor, nausea, phonophobia, and photophobia).The etiology of vertigo may be due to abnormalities of the vestibular, visual, or proprioceptive systems. The labyrinth (the paired organs of equilibrium) consists of three semicircular canals stimulated by angular acceleration and the utricle and saccule stimulated by gravitational forces and vertical acceleration. Impulses pass via the vestibular nerve to the vestibular nuclei in the brainstem and then ascend in the medial longitudinal fasiculus (to the cranial nerves for eye movement) and descend in the vestibulospinal tracts (excitatory stimuli to the extensor muscles of the head, extremities, and trunk for maintenance of upright posture). The cerebellum receives afferent impulses and functions as a center for integrating oculovestibular and postural responses. Cortical vestibular representation is at the level of the posterior temporal gyrus.Vestibular function is assessed by evaluating the oculovestibular reflex and intensity of nystagmus produced by rotatory and caloric stimulation of the labyrinth. The oculovestibular reflex permits ocular fixation on stationary objects while the head and body are in motion.Nystagmus is the observed movement of the eye in response to stimulation of the labyrinth, retrocochlear vestibular, or central vestibulo-ocular pathway. It is classified as spontaneous or induced by direction and by fatigability. The direction of nystagmus is designated by the fast component (ocular realignment). The slow component represents the oculovestibular response.Vertigo may be due to peripheral vestibular disease or central vestibular dysfunction. When not associated with actual movement, the cause of vertigo is found in the peripheral system in 85% of cases. Use of the term “peripheral” implies that the problem occurs either in the end organ (semicircular canals or utricle) or in the peripheral nerve.The clinical presentations differ and allow for localization of the vertiginous symptomatology (Table 1).The medical history is the initial and most important step in evaluation of the child who complains of dizziness or vertigo. Young children may not have the capacity or vocabulary to describe the sensation of vertigo, but they can use “playground synonyms” such as spinning, swinging, sliding, or like “a merry-go-round.” The key symptom is a sensation of motion that is either rotatory or linear.The associated aural and neurologic symptoms must be sought carefully. Are there other symptoms of hearing loss (that may fluctuate), fullness, pressure, or ringing? Is there objective evidence of a hearing disorder? If tinnitus or ringing is present, is it continuous, intermittent, or pausitile? Are there symptoms of cortical or brainstem disorders such as headache, visual changes, seizures, or loss of consciousness?The complete physical examination should focus on neurologic evaluation of the cranial nerves and cerebellar function (past-pointing and tandem gait). The auditory canal and tympanic membranes must be examined to evaluate for evidence of middle ear infection, malformations, cholesteatoma, or a perilymphatic fistula. A fistula test can be performed in a cooperative child with a pneumatic otoscope or tragal pressure. The child is instructed to look straight ahead, and the eyes are examined while continuous positive and then negative pressure is applied. Normally, there should be no drift of the eyes. In the presence of perilymphatic fistula, the eyes may drift slowly away from the ear with positive pressure and back toward the ear with negative pressure.An important sign is the presence of spontaneous or induced nystagmus. Endpoint or physiologic nystagmus is seen in normal children at a 40-degree deviation of the eyes. Because visual fixation may inhibit mild vestibular nystagmus, otolaryngologists use Frenzel glasses (+10 diopters) both to magnify the eyes and to prevent fixation suppression.Clinical testing in the office or emergency department may provide much information about the child or adolescent who has vertigo. Simple tests of balance include the Romberg and Unterberger-Fukuda test (stepping or marching test). The Romberg test evaluates proprioceptive function. A variation of the original examination—the tandem Romberg test—can be performed by having the child place one foot directly in front of the other with the arms either at the sides or crossed in front. Vision is allowed and then excluded. The Unterberger-Fukuda test is performed with the arms placed straight out in front at shoulder height. Vision is excluded, and the child is instructed to maintain the original position and march in place. A total of 50 marching steps should be taken. Normally, patients either will remain in place, step forward up to 50 cms, or turn within approximately 30 degrees of center. Patients who have chronic peripheral vestibular lesions will march slowly toward the side of the lesion.The Hallpike-Dix maneuver should be used during the neurologic examination to elicit paroxysmal positional nystagmus. The child is placed in a sitting position midway on a flat examining table and instructed to look straight ahead at all times. The examiner first turns the head to the side, and the patient then quickly is placed backwards with the head over the end of the table. The response in patients who have a positional vertigo is horizontal rotary nystagmus with the fast phase to the downward ear. The onset of the nystagmus is delayed with typically a 1- to 2-second latency that lasts for 10 to 20 seconds and is associated with a sensation of rotational vertigo. With this positioning maneuver, nystagmus and vertigo occur with the affected ear down. If a diagnosis of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is considered clinically, the Hallpike-Dix maneuver is not recommended because it may interfere with immediate bedside treatment of this disorder.All patients who have symptoms of vertigo must undergo hearing testing or, in infants, auditory brainstem evoked response testing. Additional pediatric investigations depend on the characteristics of the vertigo and accompanying symptoms in the individual patient. Children who have persistent nonspecific vertigo require a complete blood count, glucose tolerance test, and measurement of electrolytes, calcium, phosphorous, magnesium, and thyroid function. Certain patients may require testing for sickle cell disease. Patients who have sensorineural hearing loss or neurologic findings should receive computed tomography with thin cuts through the temporal bones, magnetic resonance imaging (± gadolinium), or angiography. If there is a history of associated loss of consciousness, an electroencephalographic study should be obtained.Based on the course of the symptoms, the physical examination, and the results of the previously noted investigations, the child may require referral to an otolaryngologist for additional vestibular testing. Caloric testing is the definitive procedure for identification of vestibular pathology. Electronystagmography is a collection of examinations for the saccadic, optokinetic, and smooth pursuit systems and of nystagmus induced by warming and cooling the labyrinth. These tests are nonspecific and do not provide a diagnosis, but when results are abnormal, they are suggestive of vestibular dysfunction.Other testing used by otolaryngologists in specific circumstances includes rotating chair tests, vestibular autorotation test (physiologic stimuli of high frequency produced by active head oscillations), and posturography (sway movement testing).Acute-onset vertigo or paroxysmal episodes of vertigo can be approached clinically based on the presence or absence of hearing loss (Table 2). If vertigo is continuous and unremitting, assessment can be based on the presence or absence of neurologic abnormalities (Table 3). The diagnosis of labyrinthitis is based on a history of infection preceding the onset of vertigo and the presence of hearing impairment. The child usually is most comfortable lying on the unaffected side. Any movement causes severe vertigo, nausea, and vomiting. These episodic symptoms usually subside after several days. This condition is much more frequent in children than had been recognized in the past and often is caused by minor head trauma. There is a sudden onset of hearing loss and vertigo from rupture of the round or oval window into the vestibule that results in the creation of a fistula. An abrupt change in barometric pressure (eg, decompression syndrome) also can result in a similar rupture.Menière syndrome is very uncommon in children. Symptoms consist of vertigo, fluctuating hearing loss, a sensation of pressure in the ear, and tinnitus. Recurrent episodes of vertigo and tinnitus are common, with progressive hearing loss after each event.This disorder primarily occurs in adolescents following respiratory infection. Symptoms include vertigo, nausea, and vomiting with postural instability. Episodes are self-limited but tend to recur with decreasing intensity. Diagnosis is made by electronystagmography and thermal caloric testing. Benign paroxysmal vertigo presents initially between 1 and 2 years of age, with symptoms recurring to the age of 4 years. The child presents suddenly with extreme unsteadiness and may be unable to remain upright. Nystagmus may be present, but other symptoms such as vomiting are uncommon. The child is fully conscious throughout the entire episode. Many children develop migraine later in life. The diagnosis is supported by a family history of migraine. Another migraine variant seen in infants is paroxysmal torticollis. A child who has this rare form of migraine will tilt his or her head to one side for several hours (and infrequently for up to several days). There may be associated vomiting. These episodes usually cease by 2 years of age, with many children developing typical migraine headaches by early childhood.Head trauma with or without temporal bone fracture can produce labyrinthine concussion. There is severe vertigo, with unsteadiness and falling toward the affected side. These symptoms may persist, but they gradually diminish in intensity over a 4- to 6-week period.Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo has been described in children as young as 11 years of age. The cause has been determined to be the presence of free-floating debris in the posterior semicircular canal. This type of vertigo has been related to head trauma or vestibular neuronitis. In a proportion of patients, no cause can be found. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is provoked by a change in position and lasts for seconds. Basilar artery migraine presents primarily in adolescent girls with recurrent stereotypic attacks of brainstem and cerebellar dysfunction. The clinical features can include ataxia, dysarthria, vertigo, and tinnitus. There are variable bilateral visual complaints. Alternating hemiplegia and paresthesias of the face and limbs can occur, and there can be alteration of consciousness. A severe pounding or pulsatile headache will follow. Vertigo also may be the aura preceding a generalized seizure or present as an actual ictal phenomenon (partial complex seizure). Vestibulogenic seizures are very rare and represent a form of reflex sensory epilepsy (induced by spinning).The treatment of vertigo depends on the duration and discomfort of the symptom and the underlying pathology. Acute vertigo can be treated symptomatically and with reassurance. Antiemetics can be given rectally or intramuscularly. Vestibular sedation or suppressant medication is also useful (meclizine, dimenhydrinate, promethazine, and diazepam). Persistent severe nausea and vomiting may require administration of prochlorperazine or metoclopramide.Most children who have acute vertigo recover spontaneously over a period of several weeks to months. Symptomatic recovery is due to vestibular compensation and central plasticity (reorganization of vestibular circuits). In some children and adolescents, symptoms recur, often in association with physical or psychological stress. Medications producing vestibular sedation should not be prescribed for long-term daily use because they may interfere with the normal compensation process.A specific treatment for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is a bedside maneuver (Epley particle repositioning maneuver). This maneuver relocates the free floating debris from the posterior semicircular canal into the vestibule of the labyrinth. Symptomatic relief after a single treatment session is reported in 80% to 90% of patients, although 15% to 30% may have recurrence of symptoms. The maneuver is repeated until nystagmus no longer can be elicited (Figure). A modified version of the Epley maneuver can be taught to patients with instructions to perform the activity three times a day until there are no symptoms of positional vertigo for 24 hours.Chronic or recurrent vertigo is often resistant to treatment, but it may respond to a course of clonazepam or carbamazepine. Exercise regimens also have been prescribed, with balance and gait training during dynamic tasks that precipitate the patient’s symptoms. These exercises are practiced until an asymptomatic state is reached. Management of accompanying psychological symptoms (eg, anxiety, panic attacks, depression) depends on the nature of the associated symptom.Surgical procedures for the treatment of vertigo rarely are required in childhood. Endolymphatic arachnoid shunt operations are successful in 65% of patients who have Menière disease. Disabling vertigo due to vestibular nerve or labyrinthine disorders may require vestibular nerve section. Surgery is an option for patients who have severe intractable benign paroxysmal positional vertigo using procedures to disable the posterior semicircular canal.Appropriate management of vertigo depends on determination of the etiology and carefully tailored treatment plans specific to the vestibular or central disorder producing the vertigo.",

      "abstract": "La esquizofrenia es un trastorno mental grave, complejo y heterogeneo que se asocia, generalmente, a un importante deterioro somatico, funcional y de la calidad de vida1. La esquizofrenia no tienen ningun sintoma patognomonico2 y existen otros muchos trastornos psiquiatricos que cursan con sintomas psicoticos que tambien pueden presentarse en la esquizofrenia3. Ademas, no hay pruebas especificas que aseguren su diagnostico en las primeras fases de la enfermedad, y solo el tiempo de evolucion (sintomatologia durante un periodo mas o menos prolongado segun las distintas nosologias) y el curso (en brotes, generalmente con deterioro y afectacion funcional) permiten confirmar el diagnostico de esquizofrenia3. Los sintomas pueden afectar a diversos ambitos psicologicos, pudiendose agrupar en sintomas positivos (delirios y alucinaciones, principalmente), sintomas negativos (pensamiento empobrecido, alogia, deficit volitivo), sintomas afectivos (afecto aplanado, inadecuado; ahedonia, apatia) y sintomas cognitivos (deficits neurocognitivos, estrechamente vinculados al resultado funcional de los pacientes). En general, se acepta clasicamente que la prevalencia de la esquizofrenia en la poblacion general es del 1%. Las cifras de prevalencia anual en el ano 1998, recopiladas por varios registros correspondientes a distintas provincias espanolas, coinciden con los valores asumidos de prevalencia mundial, que oscilan aproximadamente entre el 2 y el 4,5 por 1.000 habitantes4. Segun un estudio realizado en Cantabria por Vazquez-Barquero (1995), la incidencia aumenta hasta el 19 por 100.000 (18,8 para los varones y 19,3 para las mujeres) en la poblacion en situacion de riesgo (definida por los autores como aquella con edades comprendidas entre los 15 y los 54 anos)4. Segun las guias clinicas publicadas por la APA2, los objetivos del tratamiento de la fase de agudizacion psicotica interesan de manera primordial a los sintomas positivos: evitar que el paciente sufra lesiones, controlar las alteraciones del comportamiento, disminuir la gravedad de la psicosis y de sus sintomas asociados (delirios, alucinaciones, agitacion, agresividad, angustia) e identificar y analizar los factores desencadenantes del episodio agudo. Se trata ademas de recuperar con rapidez el mejor nivel de funcionamiento, establecer una alianza terapeutica con el paciente y su familia, formular planes de tratamiento a corto y a largo plazo y poner al paciente en contacto con los correspondientes servicios de asistencia ambulatoria. Vale decir que el tratamiento farmacologico instaurado para el manejo y control de estas fases agudas puede determinar el tratamiento de mantenimiento durante los periodos de compensacion clinica, por lo que la eficacia sobre sintomas negativos-afectivos-cognitivos debe ser tenida en cuenta en la eleccion terapeutica, entendiendo asi el abordaje integral de las diferentes fases y problematicas de la esquizofrenia. Durante la fase de estabilizacion, el objetivo principal del tratamiento, ademas del mantenimiento de la compensacion clinica, debe centrarse en continuar el proceso de recuperacion y lograr un mejor funcionamiento y calidad de vida2, y por ello la gran importancia de una buena vinculacion a dispositivos comunitarios, terapias rehabilitadoras, trabajo con las familias, etc. Ademas, en los pacientes que han sufrido dos o mas episodios en los ultimos 5 anos, se recomienda la administracion de medicacion antipsicotica de mantenimiento durante un tiempo indefinido2. En este sentido, los tratamientos antipsicoticos deben sumar a su eficacia un bajo perfil de efectos adversos (tolerancia), ya que cuanto menor sea la presencia de efectos indeseables, mayor sera igualmente la aceptacion subjetiva por el paciente de los farmacos prescritos, factor importante para aumentar la adherencia terapeutica (el 60-70% de los pacientes sin tratamiento de mantenimiento sufre una recaida antes de 1 ano, y este porcentaje aumenta hasta practicamente el 90% en los 2 anos siguientes2).",

Intercurrent illnesses sometimes develop in spite of bed rest, as when myocardial infarction occurs during convalescence from a pelvic or orthopedic operation. In most cases the evil effects of complete bed rest are potentiated by anesthesia, narcotics or other medication or by the results of the original illness. But it must also be recognized that many disturbances of function, such as massive collapse of the lung, attributed to operation, illness, anesthesia or medication have become evident only because the patient was forced to spend hours or days in the dorsal recumbent position. In any discussion of the effects of complete bed rest it is to be borne in mind that the disorders noted may have been aggravated, or even initiated, by a depression",

The perception that a problem constitutes an emergency is often subjective and sometimes reflects the anxieties of others rather than a real need for urgent treatment. Keeping calm and unhurried in front of an agitated patient might be as important as the use of a neuroleptic. The rather unusual psychopathological phenomena catalepsy and psychogenic twilight state (psychogenic trance) are mentioned in view of their importance for urgent assessment of mental status. The scope of the problem of suicide is outlined as far as the general physician is involved. Special attention is paid to panic disorder and attacks, a relatively new concept in medicine. Since the symptoms mimic those of cardiac, endocrine and convulsive disorders, patients with such symptoms often come to the attention of general physicians and frequently use the services of emergency departments. Early identification and treatment of panic disorder might help to avoid unnecessary repeated emergency department visits, and at the same time reduce the associated high risk of suicide and other psychiatric disorders such as depression as well as drug and alcohol abuse.",

The diagnosis of fatigue syndrome is based on exclusion of depression and additional organic conditions (anaemia, cardiovascular disorders, kidney diseases or hypothyroidism). The treatment of fatigue syndrome is complex. Physical activity, rehabilitation, psychotherapy and avoidance of factors which may increase fatigue, such as fever, anxiety, depression, pain, sleep disturbances, as well as some drugs like opioids and benzodiazepines, are important.

After administration of 12 pills during 2 days, he started hearing music and songs not heard by others. One day later, when the number of ingested pills increased to 18, he decided to discontinue amiodarone and consulted a cardiologist; no signs of physical, ECG or laboratory deterioration were observed. MHs disappeared next day and returned only as a single episode when he tried to restart amiodarone at a dose of 1 pill daily 2 weeks later. Finally, following complete removal of the medication, he experienced no MHs whatsoever.

      "title": "Moving interventions from after to before diagnosis",
      "abstract": "Some twenty years ago, the onset of psychosis was seen as the first sign of a schizophrenia spectrum disorder. Large scale epidemiological studies have since shown that, before the first psychotic episode, several deviations of normal development take place in (at least part of) the youngsters who later develop schizophrenia. While in childhood there is an average delay in reaching milestones such as walking, talking and reading, the most salient deviation during the teens is the decreased interaction with peers and decreased academic performance1. Children who later develop a psychotic disorder may have some deviant behavior, with schizotypal or schizoid features, which is expressed as few (or no) close friends and fewer social connections in sports, teams or hobbies. Occasional perceptual aberrations and magical beliefs are experienced by some 40% of children who later develop schizophrenia2, 3. In the second decade, cognitive decreases become apparent, which can be observed as lower school level than that of sibs and parents, doubling of classes or even quitting school4, 5. Finally, after puberty, subclinical psychotic symptoms emerge (or increase), which indicates the ultra high risk (UHR) period. Of course there are many exceptions, and some youngsters will develop a first psychosis out of the blue, with perfect social and cognitive skills antedating it. Yet, at least half of psychotic patients show a trajectory which provides clues for early recognition and interventions. All larger cohorts of UHR individuals show that cognitive decline is the clearest predictor of transition to psychosis5-7, together with severity of subclinical psychotic complaints. Animal models, genetic information, imaging studies in high risk groups, studies in children with 22q11 deletion syndrome, and post-mortem studies have shed light on neurobiological deviations that take place in these early phases, before the so-called first psychotic episode. Decreases in GABA functioning, especially of Chandelier cells, reduced NMDA receptor activity, increased oxidative stress and insufficient scavengers (especially glutathione), increased pro-inflammatory status of the brain and lower mitochondrial functioning add to varying degree to an individual's susceptibility towards developing schizophrenia. Some of these neurobiological deviations can be measured in vivo (i.e., glutathione and GABA concentrations by magnetic resonance spectroscopy; inflammatory status by positron emission tomography), whilst others cannot (density of Chandelier cells). This knowledge provides a basis for potential targeted treatment of specific susceptible subgroups of individuals with the same phenotype, but is not yet ready for clinical use. Epidemiology, cohort and case-control studies provide evidence of several risk factors occurring in the teenage period that can further increase risk of onset of psychosis. Among them are drug abuse, bullying, social exclusion, sleep deprivation, stressful events, inflammatory conditions and immigration. At the same time, pilot studies on interventions in the preclinical period have been performed, that showed efficacy of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) (although not compared to an active control condition)8 and of nutritional supply of omega-3 fatty acids (although not replicated in a larger group)9. At present, we do not know everything we would like to know to act early to prevent transition to psychosis in vulnerable youngsters, but we do have some basic clues on which we can act already. Each year we wait to complete our knowledge, many youngsters go on to develop a schizophrenia spectrum disorder. This topic should be a high priority in psychiatric research, as even UHR individuals who do not develop psychosis tend to manifest (other) severe psychiatric problems. A psychiatric disease affecting an adolescent or young adult has a large impact on the person himself, but also on his family, surrounding and society at large. There are several ways forward, both for researchers and for health care workers. For the latter, schools are the most important partners for collaboration, since cognition is such an important risk factor. Cognitive decline is first detected at school, and lower functioning than in previous years, with a prominent deviation from sibs, should be a reason to contact health care workers who can screen for (subclinical) psychotic features. When these are present, a working alliance between mental care workers, family and school should be made to prevent further hits, i.e. prevent the youngster from starting to abuse drugs, actively avoid (or stop) being bullied and socially isolated, regulate exposure to stress and sleep. For researchers, individual neurobiological deviations at the UHR stage need to be tested for correction with specific interventions, such as supplementation with n-acetylcysteine to restore glutathione function, glutamatergic or GABA-ergic agents to improve signaling of the inhibitory interneurons, and omega-3 fatty acids or anti-inflammatory agents to restore optimal brain condition. In addition, CBT for UHR needs to be compared to other psychosocial interventions, and efficacy has to be tested at group level and in specific patient groups. In short, there is much work to do for all of us in order to prevent transition to psychosis of vulnerable youngsters, and we need to make haste. Iris E.

      "abstract": "1. Preliminary observation would indicate that Tofrānil is a useful drug in the treatment of depressive states. It is not a tranquilizer and, therefore, is of little value in other conditions. It is a promising drug which can be used as an anti-depressant. However, its indication and scope must be studied for a longer period to determine what symptoms respond best to it. 2. The effect of Tofrānil in many patients can be increased by the concomitant use of a tranquilizer or a stimulant. In a number of patients Tofrānil, by removing the depressive elements, frees and exaggerates anxiety. 3. It can be used in combination with electric shock or after electric shock as a maintenance dose. 4. It is of little value in the treatment of schizophrenics and in paranoid types may often aggravate the condition and break down an unstable equilibrium to which the patient has become adjusted. 5. The combined use of Tofrānil and a tranquilizer is helpful in certain psychoneurotic states, associated with anxiety or with reactive depressions. 6. It is of value in the treatment of depressions occurring in the older age group. 7. High doses are unnecessary and the effective range is somewhere between 75 and 150 mgm. per day. 8. For the most part, side effects are minimal, particularly in the younger age group. As one approaches the older age group, the frequency of such side effects increases, but usually they are more uncomfortable than serious. In patients over 60 there may be a tendency to sudden falls which occur without warning. It is recommended that in older patients the dosage be limited to 75 mgm. or less. 9. Side effects can usually be reduced in frequency or intensity by a reduction in the dosage. 10. Long-term use of the drug is apparently necessary as patients may relapse, at least in the early stages when the drug is prematurely removed. Since the drug is rapidly excreted, it is necessary to give the medication 3 times a day.",

We aimed to review the association between, and medical management of, narcolepsy and psychosis in children and adults.We reviewed the full text of 100 papers from 187 identified by a PubMed search on narcolepsy plus any of these keywords: psychosis, schizophrenia, delusion, side effects, safety, and bipolar disorder.Three relevant groups are described. (i) In typical narcolepsy, psychotic-like symptoms include predominantly visual hallucinations at the sleep-wake transition (experienced as \"not real\") and dissociation because of intrusion of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep phenomena into wakefulness. (ii) Atypical patients (\"the psychotic form of narcolepsy\") experience more severe and vivid, apparently REM-related hallucinations or dream/reality confusions, which patients may rationalize in a delusion-like way. (iii) Some patients have a comorbid schizophrenia spectrum disorder with psychotic symptoms unrelated to sleep. Psychostimulants used to treat narcolepsy may trigger psychotic symptoms in all three groups. We analyzed 58 published cases from groups 2 and 3 (n = 17 and 41). Features that were reported significantly more frequently in atypical patients include visual and multimodal hallucinations, sexual and mystical delusions, and false memories. Dual diagnosis patients had more disorganized symptoms and earlier onset of narcolepsy.Epidemiological studies tentatively suggest a possible association between narcolepsy and schizophrenia only for very early-onset cases, which could be related to the partially overlapping neurodevelopmental changes observed in these disorders. We propose a clinical algorithm for the management of cases with psychotic-like or psychotic features.",

      "title": "Mechanism of emergence agitation induced by sevoflurane anesthesia",
      "abstract": "Sevoflurane is an inhalational anesthetic used widely as a pediatric or outpatient anesthesia due to its excellent hemodynamic stability and low blood solubility, which allows rapid induction and emergence from general anesthesia, as well as control of the depth of anesthesia. However, when sevoflurane is used alone it is associated with a higher incidence of emergence agitation in children. The rapid removal of residual anesthetics due to low blood solubility of sevoflurane has been suggested to cause emergence agitation in some patients [1,2]. In addition, a variety of other explanations have been proposed for the etiology of emergence agitation. These include the lack of a young child's ability to adapt to sudden changes due to an unfamiliar environment after awakening, immature neurological development, anxiety from being separated from their parents, increased pain sensation and sympathetic hyperactivation [2,3].\r\n\r\nEmergence agitation is characterized by self-limiting aggressive agitation that develops in the early phase of awakening from anesthesia at the end of surgery. Emergence agitation can be dangerous to patients, particularly to young children. Patients suffering from emergence agitation may harm themselves and dislodge drains or catheters, which affects the results of surgery. They may inflict a bodily injury on their care-givers or cause a paranoiac accident, which makes the management and monitoring of patients at the post anesthesia care unit difficult [4]. There have been many attempts to reduce the incidence of emergence agitation but the etiology and preventive treatments of emergence agitation are still unclear.\r\n\r\nSome studies have reported that midazolam which acts on its target effect site GABAA, reduces emergence agitation [5,6], and its antagonist, flumazenil reverses this effect [7]. However, the mechanism is still not clear, and it is not known whether sevoflurane and midazolam interact at the GABAA receptor level. Most GABAA receptors consist of two α subunits, two β subunits and a γ subunit. The γ2 subunits of GABAA receptor exist as a long type (γ2L) and a short type (γ2S), generated by alternative splicing of RNA. The most common pattern for GABAA receptor is α1β2γ2 type, which accounts for 43% of all GABAA receptors [8]. This implies that the diversity of the subtype variants and the distribution of GABAA receptors may affect the anesthetics from subject to subject.\r\n\r\nIn this edition of the Korean journal of anesthesiology, Eom et al. [9] postulated that alternative splicing of the γ2 subunit is related to emergence agitation on the basis of characteristics of midazolam, sevoflurane and γ2 subunit. Sevoflurane binds to GABAA receptor, benzodiazepine-like midazolam prevents emergence agitation and also binds to α and γ subunit of GABAA receptor, and alternative splicing of γ2 subunit is different based on the age of the patient. Whole-cell patch clamp to the α1β2γ2L and α1β2γ2S GABAA receptors expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells with midazolam and/or sevoflurane was performed. The concentration-response relationships were recorded for midazolam and sevoflurane. They showed that the concentration-response relationships for midazolam and sevoflurane were dose-dependent with no differences between the α1β2γ2L and α1β2γ2S subtypes. It was concluded that the difference in the γ2 subunit cannot explain the emergence agitation of sevoflurane in children in vitro.\r\n\r\nThese finding suggests that co-application of sevoflurane and midazolam enhances the GABA current according to the alternative splicing of the γ2 subunit and concentration of both drugs. Their effort to reveal the mechanism of emergence agitation induced by sevoflurane anesthesia could be a major step towards studying the basic mechanisms of the anesthetic agent. Further study to reveal the mechanism of emergence agitation is expected.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a debilitating mood disorder which carries a high risk of suicide. A long-standing proposal is that it is caused by a functional deficit of noradrenergic and/or serotonergic transmission in the brain. So far, attempts to find a neurochemical marker in humans that could support this view have not succeeded. However, in animal models, antidepressant drugs do prevent abnormal behaviours caused by depletion of brain monoamines. Certainly all established antidepressants either increase release of noradrenaline and/or 5-HT (e.g. MAO inhibitors or mianserin) or inhibit their neuronal reuptake (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants, fluoxetine, venlafaxine). Both these actions will increase monoaminergic transmission in the brain. Outstanding research goals are to explain, and eliminate, the problematic delay in the therapeutic actions of antidepressant drugs and to develop alternative effective treatments. This research is likely to encompass neuroendocrine systems (e.g. the glucocorticoids) which also express abnormalities in depression and are known to influence monoamine function.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Most people with Parkinson’s disease (PD) do not experience hallucinations. However, they do develop in a distinct minority, usually later in the course of PD. These are not necessarily reflective of dementia and if they develop, this does not necessarily imply that you are becoming demented. Medications for PD may be responsible in some cases. Most importantly, they are treatable. Hallucinations experienced by people with PD are varied. In the mildest and simplest form, they are spots, dots, lines, or other small shapes in your field of vision. More troubling are hallucinations of people, animals, bugs, and so on. Hallucinations that I have commonly heard described include the following: • Animals in the yard • Children playing outside the window • Family, friends, or strangers sitting in the living room • Bugs crawling on the refrigerator (or countertop, floor, etc.)",

      "title": "“This Is Not the Original Timeline”: A Case Report of an Extended Dissociative Episode in a Healthy Young Male Accompanied with Severe Decline in Mental State",
      "abstract": "Dissociation is a disconnection between a person’s thoughts, memories, feelings, actions, or sense of who he or she is. Dissociative disorders can be described and understood using the combination of five core symptoms: amnesia, depersonalisation, derealisation, identity confusion, or identity alteration. They are frequently associated with previous experience of trauma. The challenge in diagnosis and the lifetime prevalence of approximately 10% in the general population and clinical psychiatric setting ensures the relevance of this case. We write about a 21-year-old gentleman with history of autism and obsessive compulsive disorder, but no significant medical history was presented to the emergency department with increased anxiety, subsequently progressing to agitation, pacing, and becoming nonverbal. No significant findings were uncovered on laboratory blood testing (other than prolactin 737 mu/L and phosphate 0.35 mmol/L), lumbar puncture, or brain imaging. Consequently, he was admitted to a psychiatric unit for assessment. The patient continued to present with severe disorientation, limited speech, and altered state of consciousness with occasional spastic-like movements. Antipsychotic and benzodiazepine medication was initiated, with no significant change in presentation. The patient continued to be witnessed wandering and having incoherent speech. First signs of improvement came 21 days postadmission with brief conversation and lucidity. This continued to improve over the next 7 days where he was reported to be at his baseline mental state. Environmental stressors including university examinations, the COVID-19 pandemic, and recent contact with his estranged father were possible precipitants to the episode. The patient reported almost complete unawareness of the psychiatric admission. A diagnosis of dissociative disorder, unspecified, was given. This case shows the management and diagnostic challenges of patients presenting with the aforementioned symptoms. There are no formal guidelines for the management of treating dissociative episodes, and this case report suggests the possible benefits of a drug-free period of watchful waiting upon admission.",

      "title": "Nonfebrile Seizures",
      "abstract": "Nonfebrile seizures occur in children of all ages and often pose a challenge to the pediatrician in terms of cause, management, and prognosis. The term “seizure” does not imply a diagnosis, but rather indicates a clinical event that reflects a time-related dysfunction of the central nervous system (CNS) and may signal a serious underlying abnormality;however, more often in children the term indicates a transient disturbance of brain function. The pediatrician’s role is to determine the cause of the seizure and to treat the condition, based on an understanding of its pathogenesis, impact on the child and family, and the long-term outlook of the condition.Seizures and epilepsy are not synonymous. A seizure(convulsion) is defined as a paroxysmal involuntary discharge of cortical neurons that may be manifested clinically by an impairment or loss of consciousness, abnormal motor activity, behavioral and emotional abnormalities, sensory disturbances, or autonomic dysfunction. Some seizures are characterized by abnormal movements without loss of consciousness. The term epilepsy refers to spontaneous recurrent seizures unrelated to fever. In other words, a patient who has a single nonfebrile seizure that does not recur over time would not merit the diagnosis of epilepsy. The ages of greatest risk for nonfebrile seizures are during infancy, childhood, and adolescence. The annual incidence rate from birth to 20 years of age is 0.56 per 1000; the cumulative risk of epilepsy during the first 2 decades of life is approximately 1%. The prevalence of epilepsy in the pediatric population is 4 to 6 cases per 1000 children.Some may ask why it is necessary to classify epilepsy if the treatment and prognosis are similar for all children. There are primarily two forms of epilepsy characterized by either generalized seizures or a focal onset, and generalized and focal seizures respond predictably to some classes of anticonvulsants and not to others. The clinical appearance of a seizure may not indicate clearly whether the origin of the epileptiform discharge is focal or generalized. For example, a child may present with repetitive episodes of staring and unresponsiveness. Is this a generalized absence or a complex partial seizure? The proper classification will dictate the appropriate anticonvulsant. Finally, accurate classification of epilepsy permits the pediatrician to discuss the prognosis of the condition with the child and family. Most likely the child who has absence epilepsy will become seizure-free and not require medication as a teenager; focal seizures do not have the same favorable outcome.The International Classification of Epileptic Seizures (ICES) was introduced in 1981 and is based primarily on the clinical description of the seizure and the associated changes on electroencephalogram (EEG). The majority of seizures can be classified according to the ICES nomenclature (Table 1). Simple partial seizures (SPS) are associated most commonly with asynchronous clonic or tonic motor movements such as forced deviation of the head and eyes to one side. An SPS typically is short-lived,rarely persisting longer than 10 to 20 seconds, and the child remains conscious and is able to verbalize throughout it. The EEG characteristically shows unilateral spikes or sharp waves in the anterior temporal region, but the discharges may be bilateral;occasionally a multifocal spike pattern is recorded.Complex partial seizures (CPS) initially may share the characteristic appearance of an SPS with or without an aura, followed by impairment of consciousness. Alternatively, CPS may begin with loss of consciousness. The average duration of a CPS is 1 to 2 minutes, which is significantly longer than an SPS or an absence seizure. Aura is common and signals the onset of a seizure in approximately 30% of children who have CPS,with the child complaining of epigastric discomfort, fear, or an unpleasant discharge may spread from a temporal lobe throughout the cortex, causing a generalized tonic-clonic convulsion (termed secondary generalization). The majority of children who have CPS have an abnormal EEG characterized by sharp waves or spike discharges in the anterior temporal or frontal lobe or by multifocal spikes. Partial seizures are the most common form of epilepsy in children.Simple (petit mal) absence seizures typically have their onset at 5 to 6 years of age and are characterized by brief (5 to 20 sec) lapses in consciousness, speech, or motor activity,sometimes associated with flickering of the eyelids. Absence seizures never are accompanied by an aura or a postictal period of drowsiness, but automatisms may be observed during the seizure. The automatisms usually consist of eye blinking or lip smacking. Hyperventilation for 3 to 4 minutes by the cooperative patient frequently induces a seizure. The EEG is characterized by 3 per second generalized spike and wave discharges that indicate a clinical seizure. In contrast, an atypical absence seizure is characterized by associated myoclonic movements of the face and body,sometimes leading to loss of body tone, which causes the child to fall. The EEG pattern commonly is associated with either 2 to 2.5 per second or 3.5 to 4.5 per second generalized spike and wave discharges.Myoclonic seizures may occur in isolation or in association with other types of epilepsy, including tonic-clonic convulsions. Myoclonic seizures are characterized by brief, often repetitive symmetric muscle contractions with loss of normal body tone. Atonic seizures are difficult to differentiate from myoclonic seizures; in many cases they represent a prolonged myoclonic seizure. Atonic seizures typically cause the child to fall because of the sudden loss of postural tone.Primary generalized tonic-clonic (formerly called grand mal) and tonic or clonic seizures are well known to most pediatricians. These seizures are characterized by sudden loss of consciousness and tonic-clonic, tonic, or clonic contractions. Tonic seizures are associated with intense muscle contraction and clonic seizures with rhythmic, usually symmetric jerking movements. The child may develop perioral cyanosis and lose bladder control. The seizure is followed by a 30 to 60 minute period of deep sleep and postictal headache.The major disadvantage of the ICES classification is its failure to recognize certain distinct epileptic syndromes that are age-related, are characterized by specific types of seizures, and have varying etiologies that differ significantly from causes of epilepsy in the adult patient population. A“syndromic” classification proposed in 1989 by the International League Against Epilepsy permits selection of an anticonvulsant that is most appropriate to treat the patient’s predominant seizure type. The primary drawback of this more sophisticated approach to diagnosis and treatment of a child’s epileptic syndrome is that at present, only approximately 50% of seizure disorders in children can be placed into a specific syndrome. For the purpose of this review, the clinical description,characteristic EEG patterns, treatment, and prognosis of five epileptic syndromes are outlined briefly in Table 2. These syndromes include infantile spasms, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, Landau-Kleffner syndrome, benign childhood epi- lepsy with centrotemporal (rolandic) spikes, and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (Janz syndrome).Despite the advent of molecular diagnosis and new neuroimaging techniques, the etiology of most seizures in children remains unknown. The acute onset of seizures may result from cerebral trauma(head injury), CNS infection (meningitis, encephalitis), cerebrovascular diseases (infarction, arteriovenous malformation, hemorrhage, venous thrombosis), toxins (lead), brain tumor (cerebral or extracerebral),specific epilepsy syndromes (Table 2), genetic/heredi-tary diseases (eg, Down syndrome, tuberous sclerosis), metabolic and systemic diseases (endocrine, renal), degenerative disorders (leukodystrophy), or hereditary malformations (eg, cortical dysplasia, lissencephaly).An increasing number of epilepsy syndromes have been identified that are the result of a genetic abnormality. To date, the chromosomal loci have been identified for seven epilepsy genes and three epilepsy syndromes, including benign familial neonatal convulsions (chromosomes 20q and 8q), fatal progressive myoclonic epilepsy or Unverricht-Lundborg disease (chromosome 21q), and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (chromosome 6p). The gene locus on chromosome 6 also may be responsible for other types of generalize tonic-clonic seizures. Studies of large numbers of families that have other well-defined epilepsy syndromes likely will uncover additional epilepsy genes.The age of presentation often provides a clue to the possible cause of epilepsy. Hypoxic-ischemic encepha-lopathy is the most common cause of seizures in the newborn, which characteristically are apparent within the first 24 hours. Children who have neonatal seizures following a hypoxic-ischemic insult are at significant risk to continue to have seizures (ie, epilepsy). Pyridoxine dependency may be the cause of seizures that begin shortly after birth, especially if they are associated with signs of fetal distress and particularly when there is a history of seizures in utero. Metabolic encephalopathies typically are associated with seizures in the newborn and usually are unresponsive to conventional anticonvulsants. The infant who has a urea cycle abnormality or a disorder of amino acid metabolism such as nonketotic hyperglycinemia may appear normal at birth, but within a few days will lose interest in feeding and sucking, followed by lethargy proceeding to coma and seizures, which often are of the myoclonic variety. Disorders of mitochondria, such as Leigh disease and pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency,often present during infancy with repetitive seizures. The anoxic and metabolic encephalopathies that are associated with seizures will not be discussed further; several excellent reviews are included in the reading list.With the advent of modern imaging technology, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), single photon emission computed tomography(SPECT), and positron emission tomography (PET), it has become evident that structural abnormalities of the brain and congenital disorders of neuronal migration play an important role in the causation of epilepsy. The migrational abnormality may be severe and generalized, as seen in the child who has lissencephaly, which is characterized by a smooth brain due to a lack of gyri and a structure equivalent to a 12-week fetus. On the other hand, discrete collections of aberrant neurons visible by MRI imaging may be the cause of focal epilepsy in an otherwise normal child. A small number of children who have generalized infantile spasms have been found by EEG, MRI,SPECT, and PET scanning to have focal nests of dislocated neurons. In these cases, surgical excision of the abnormal cortex may result in complete seizure control.There is strong evidence that simple febrile seizures are not a cause of epilepsy, but whether a prolonged febrile seizure, especially during infancy,may cause mesial temporal sclerosis, thereby producing epilepsy at a later age, is still controversial. The cause of epilepsy in a cognitively and neurologically normal child has not been well defined; additional studies in these children may uncover a genetic basis.A presumptive diagnosis of epilepsy generally is made from a history of spontaneous recurrent seizures and findings on the physical examination because it is unlikely that the child will have a seizure in the presence of the physician. In response to careful questioning, the parent usually can give a good account of the seizure and whether it is generalized or focal in onset. The child also should participate in history taking because the existence of aura, which signifies a focal onset, may not be known to the parents. Certain seizures, such as absence or pseudoseizures, may be provoked in the clinical setting by hyperventilation or the power of suggestion. If the history and description of seizures remain unclear, the parent can videotape seizures for later review by the pediatrician. Generally, if a diagnosis of epilepsy is in doubt following the examination and an EEG, it is in the child's best interest to watch and wait before initiating specific treatment. It is possible that a condition mimicking epilepsy will become apparent during the period of observation.A number of paroxysmal nonepileptic disorders share features with epilepsy and, therefore, may be misdiagnosed by the physician. None of these conditions responds to anticonvulsant drugs. Breath-holding spells are such an example. Unlike epilepsy, breath-holding spells always are provoked and stereotyped and often are predictable. The child is frightened or chastised or falls and bumps his or her head, which is followed immediately by a brief shrill cry, forced expiration, and sudden loss of consciousness. The child becomes cyanotic(occasionally pallid) and during the succeeding 30 to 60 seconds may have several generalized tonic-clonic movements before consciousness returns. The child is lethargic and sleepy for a brief period following the event. Gastroesophageal reflux may cause laryngospasm, bradycardia, and apneic episodes in an infant, which may be confused with a seizure disorder. Prompt management of the reflux usually brings the apnea under control.Benign paroxysmal vertigo(BPV) often is confused with epilepsy. BPV causes the normal toddler to stagger or fall suddenly and to become pale and frightened. Some children will vomit during the episode, and all children will become dysarthric and complain of vertigo if they are able to verbalize. About 25% of children will have nystagmus during the attack. Although episodes of BPV usually are brief, persisting for 1 to 2 minutes, they may recur repetitively throughout the day.Simple syncope (fainting) is common in the adolescent and adult but is unusual in a child younger than 10 years of age. Tilt-table testing is a useful method to distinguish simple syncope from a seizure when the diagnosis is uncertain.Two types of syncope or loss of consciousness that begin during childhood may be confused with epilepsy and pose a significant hazard to the child. Cough syncope often is associated with poorly controlled asthma. These children develop cough paroxysms a few hours after falling asleep. The paroxysms may be so prolonged and persistent that the child loses consciousness and control of the bladder sphincter. There often are generalized tonic-clonic movements during the period of unconsciousness. The child has no recollection of these events the following morning. The prolonged QT syndrome results from an abnormality of myocardial function due to a familial or acquired insult, which may result in ventricular arrhythmias leading to sudden death. Children who have the prolonged QT syndrome are especially prone to cardiac arrhythmias during exercise or periods of anxiety or fear. It is vital not to confuse this condition with simple syncope or epilepsy because genetic counseling, teaching the parents cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or introducing specific drug therapy aimed at preventing the arrhythmia (eg, beta blockers) may be life-saving.Night terrors are common,especially in boys 4 to 6 years of age,and sometimes may be confused with epilepsy. They typically develop during the early stages of sleep and are characterized by the sudden onset of crying or screaming,uncontrollable flailing of the extremities, unintelligible speech, dilated pupils, and drooling. A few minutes later the child returns to sleep and has no recollection of the event.The episodic dyscontrol syndrome (rage attacks) is a behavioral disorder observed primarily in boys ages 6 to 12 years. The rage attack always is provoked by a confrontation with a student, friend, or more likely a parent, usually the mother. Following the precipitating event,the child simply loses control,lashing out at the parent; scratching,biting, or physically injuring the person; and sometimes threatening the individual with a knife or weapon. There usually is profanity and verbal threats, but no loss of consciousness. At the conclusion of the episode, the child usually is remorseful. In my experience, the largest number of referrals are initiated by child psychiatrists who wish to exclude CPS as a possible etiology for the severe behavioral outbursts observed in these children.Masturbation may mimic a seizure disorder. This behavior is seen most frequently in 2- to 4-year-old girls. In the recumbent position, the child develops repetitive rhythmic copulatory movements accompanied by a staring appearance, perspiration,plethoric facies, and unresponsiveness to the parents’ or siblings’voices.Tics are involuntary, spasmodic,nonrhythmic, repetitive movements. Unlike seizures, tics are stereotypic movements, unassociated with impaired consciousness; at times they may be suppressed by the patient.Pseudoseizures commonly are misdiagnosed as epilepsy; at the time of referral, patients typically are receiving three or four anticonvulsants with poor seizure control. Pseudoseizures develop most often during the preadolescent or adolescent periods in patients who have a previous history of epilepsy. The seizures may seem very realistic but often are bizarre and characterized by peculiar extremity postures,frequent falling without injury, and various vocal utterances. A pseudoseizure rarely persists longer than 5 minutes, and tongue biting or perioral cyanosis are uncommon. Frequently the recovery is sudden compared with the typical postictal period associated with a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. Pseudoseizures rarely occur when the child is unattended and lack the typical neurologic findings observed during a seizure, such as unresponsive dilated pupils and extensor plantar responses. The eyelids may be closed firmly, and the patient resists eye opening by the examiner during a pseudoseizure. Because a significant number of children who have pseudoseizures also have epilepsy,the presence of epilepsy does not exclude the diagnosis. A useful rule of thumb is that urinary or fecal incontinence during the ictal event excludes the diagnosis of pseudoseizures. Adolescent girls subjected to incest or sexual abuse may present with pseudoseizures. The pediatrician must consider initiating a comprehensive evaluation to exclude sexual abuse for all adolescent girls who have pseudoseizures.The EEG is a useful adjunct to the history and physical examination in establishing the diagnosis of epilepsy, but a routine interictal(between seizures) EEG will show an epileptiform abnormality in only approximately 60% of patients. EEG abnormalities are more likely to be recorded in the infant or child who has epilepsy than in the adolescent or adult who has epilepsy. Various procedures are employed during the EEG in an attempt to activate a seizure discharge in a child suspected of having epilepsy, including eye closure, hyperventilation, photic stimulation, and in specific circumstances, sleep deprivation and special electrode placement (eg,zygomatic leads). Prolonged EEG monitoring with simultaneous closed-circuit video recording is used in specific circumstances. For example, prolonged recording is useful for identifying ictal seizures that rarely are captured during routine EEG testing. Furthermore,prolonged EEG recording is particularly helpful in determining the location and frequency of seizure discharges while simultaneously visualizing and recording changes in levels of consciousness and the presence of clinical signs, which is critical for proper classification of the seizure disorder. Detailed localization and frequency of the seizure focus is essential for choosing appropriate candidates for epilepsy surgery. Finally, prolonged EEG recording is the “gold standard” test for investigating a patient who has suspected pseudoseizures.Unfortunately, the routine EEG often is not used appropriately. It cannot be used reliably to determine the appropriate duration of anticonvulsant therapy or to explain a lack of response to therapy. The EEG does provide essential information in at least four situations: to support a clinical diagnosis by typical EEG changes during the recording(eg, benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes or absence epilepsy); to differentiate seizure disorders with similar clinical characteristics (eg, absence versus CPS); to detect potential structural brain lesions (focal slow-wave abnormalities); and to identify patients who have pseudoseizures.Computed tomography (CT) is of little use in the evaluation of a child who has epilepsy, except in special circumstances such as investigation of a child suspected of having congenital Cytomegalovirus infection characterized by periventricular calcifications or tuberous sclerosis typified by calcified tubers in the subependymal layer. CT studies of children who have epilepsy have shown an abnormality in approximately 30% of cases, consisting primarily of cortical atrophy or dilated ventricles; this provides little useful information for clinical management.MRI is gaining increasing importance in the study of children who have epilepsy, especially in examination of temporal lobe and hippocampal atrophy and sclerosis in patients resistant to anticonvulsant therapy. The use of MRI should be reserved for investigating all children who present with complex partial seizures, those who have a focal neurologic deficit (either static or postictal), those who present with complex seizures of increasing frequency or severity regardless of type, and all adolescents who have a first seizureThe initial step in the management of a child who is suspected of having epilepsy is to ensure that the paroxysmal event was, in fact, a seizure. A thorough history and examination coupled with appropriate studies and observation should distinguish nonepileptic events from seizures, as discussed previously.Whether anticonvulsant medication should be prescribed for the child who has a first nonfebrile seizure depends on the seizure type. The risk of recurrence following absence(typical or atypical) seizures,myoclonic seizures, and infantile spasms is certain; thus,anticonvulsants are initiated at the outset. A child who has a single afebrile tonic-clonic seizure, particularly if it occurs on awakening, has a good prognosis; 75% will not experience a second convulsion if the neurologic examination and EEG are normal and there is no family history of epilepsy. Anticonvulsants are not advised following the initial seizure in these children.However, when two or more unprovoked afebrile seizures occur within a 6- to 12-month time frame,anticonvulsants usually are indicated. Fasting blood glucose and serum calcium levels are indicated prior to the initiation of anticonvulsant therapy if the history suggests hypoglycemia or hypocalcemia as a cause of the seizure.Following the decision to treat with an anticonvulsant, the choice of drug depends on the seizure type or specific epileptic syndrome, as well as the efficacy and toxicity of the agent. The therapeutic goal is to treat with a single anticonvulsant that is most likely to control seizures completely with little or no adverse effects. Unfortunately, it is difficult to achieve these objectives in many cases. Table 3summarizes the choice of drugs used in specific seizure types, the dose, the range of therapeutic serum levels, and the potential side effects and toxicity for each anticonvulsant.The amount of attention that should be given to the standard therapeutic ranges of anticonvulsants in the management of childhood epilepsy is very controversial (see Table 3). Some children achieve seizure control with subtherapeutic serum drug levels (eg, carbamazepine); for others, the seizures do not come under control until serum drug levels above the published range are reached (eg, valproic acid). Thus, if standard therapeutic serum levels are used as the only benchmark,children will be overtreated or undertreated routinely. There are specific periods when therapeutic drug monitoring is indicated: 1) At the initiation of therapy to ensure that the therapeutic range is achieved, 2)During times of accelerated growth, and 3) If the seizures are out of control or the child is toxic. In general, the patient’s response to treatment is more important than the serum concentration of the drug.I also recommend routine drug monitoring in the following clinical situations: 1) Children who undergo a change in seizure type; 2) Patients who continue to have seizures in spite of an adequate drug dose based on weight and age; 3) Patients who have hepatic or renal disease;4) Children treated with phenytoin;5) Patients receiving multiple drugs(polytherapy), especially valproic acid, lamotrigine, and phenobarbital,because drug interactions are common; 6) Children who have mental and physical handicaps in whom drug toxicity may be difficult to evaluate; and 7) Patients and families who are noncompliant with the drug regimen.Adverse reactions to anticonvulsant drugs are common and on rare occasion may be life-threatening. Most serious adverse reactions occur during the initial 1 to 3 months of therapy and are more prominent when specific risks are present. For example, severe hepatotoxicity in association with valproic acid therapy is more likely to occur in the developmentally delayed or neurologically abnormal child younger than 2 years of age who is being treated with multiple anticonvulsants. The risk is even greater if the infant has an underlying metabolic disorder, particularly involving mitochondrial function. If the cause of the child’s seizure disorder is unknown, screening for a metabolic disorder (eg, blood gases, serum lactate and pyruvate, carnitine,ammonia, amino acids, and urinary organic acids) should be under-taken prior to the introduction of valproic acid.Routine screening with liver function tests and a complete blood count does not necessarily select patients destined to develop a serious adverse drug reaction such as aplastic anemia, hepatotoxicity, or Stevens-Johnson syndrome. In many cases the drug complication becomes apparent clinically prior to changes in blood test results. Thus,careful clinical monitoring of the patient, especially during the initial phase of treatment, is mandatory to identify early adverse reactions.Anticonvulsants may induce or inhibit enzyme production or they may displace another anticonvulsant from a shared plasma protein-binding site. Several anticonvulsants are capable of enzyme induction,including carbamazepine, primidone,phenytoin, and phenobarbital. When these drugs are used together, they may lower the plasma levels of each other by increasing the rate of metabolism. Conversely, enzyme inhibition tends to increase plasma levels by decreasing the rate of metabolism. An important example of this phenomenon is the potential for carbamazepine toxicity when erythromycin also is prescribed. Erythromycin inhibits microsomal enzyme systems, which results in decreased clearance of carbamazepine. Phenytoin and phenobarbital may be displaced from plasma protein-binding sites by valproic acid, which may lead to toxic serum levels that can be adjusted by lowering the dose of valproic acid. Valproic acid also reduces the plasma clearance and prolongs the half-life of lamotrigine. It is not known whether this interaction explains the increased incidence of severe skin rashes and Stevens-Johnson syndrome when valproic acid and lamotrigine are used simultaneously.Each anticonvulsant drug can cause unwanted behavioral and cognitive side effects in children. What often is not appreciated is that up to 30% of untreated children who have epilepsy experience behavioral problems, perhaps in part as a psychological reaction to the chronic condition or to dysfunction of the CNS. Furthermore, intellectual impairment has been well-described in children who have epilepsy. It often is difficult to determine whether behavior changes or poor academic performance by a child who has epilepsy is the result of the medication, the underlying seizure disorder, or both. Often the behavioral or performance problems are subtle,and they are recognized by parents or the teacher only after discontinuation of the anticonvulsant.Phenobarbital causes behavioral side effects in up to 50% of children, including personality change, irritability, fitful sleep,hyperactivity, short attention span, and depression. Many of the unwanted symptoms become less apparent when the dose is decreased. Because of the high frequency of side effects associated with phenobarbital, this agent no longer is the drug of choice in the treatment of childhood epilepsy. In decreasing frequency, the following drugs also may cause similar behavioral problems—ACTH, benzodiazepines, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and primidone. Valproic acid is the least likely to affect a child’s behavior adversely. Valproic acid also has little untoward influence on a child’s cognitive performance, although any anticonvulsant may produce unwanted behavioral side effects.If the child develops an adverse behavioral change following initiation of anticonvulsant therapy, theppediatrician has several options, including lowering the dose or if the problem persists,substituting another anticonvulsant for the offending drug. This situation also affords an opportunity to reassess the need for an antiepileptic drug. Follow-up should include an assessment of the child’s behavior and school performance on every visit. If academic or behavioral problems continue after drug readjustment or substitution, the child must be referred for a comprehensive evaluation to assess learning and cognitive parameters; plans also must be established for appropriate remediation.If a child’s seizures are completely controlled for a period of approximately 2 years, consideration should be given to weaning from the anticonvulsant, particularly if the child has no risk factors for seizures.The most prominent risk factors associated with recurrence of seizures include developmental delay or motor handicap, age greater than 12 years at seizure onset, neonatal seizures, and multiple seizures before control is attained. Absence and generalized tonic-clonic seizures on awakening tend to have a better outcome following drug withdrawal than partial complex seizures with secondary generalization. Agreement is not uniform as to the predictability of EEG abnormalities and seizure recurrence, whether at the onset of therapy or during follow-up. There is mounting evidence, however,that paroxysmal EEG features (eg, spike and wave) are a contraindication to withdrawing anticonvulsants. If the child has several risk factors, a trial with monotherapy (if the child is receiving several drugs) following 2 years of complete seizure control is suggested.The weaning process should be supervised closely and occur over a period of 4 to 6 months. If the child is receiving polytherapy, one drug should be removed at a time; the entire weaning period will be extended compared with that of a child receiving monotheraphy. Of those children who are seizure-free for 2 years and who have no risk factors, 70% to 75% will remain seizure-free without anticonvulsants. The most vulnerable time for seizure recurrence is the initial 6 months following drug withdrawal. If seizures recur, the child once again is placed on the drug that initially provided seizure control for at least 2 years. If the seizures reappear following a second drug withdrawal,life-long anticonvulsant theraphy may be required.The ketogenic diet was used frequently for the treatment of intractable epilepsy before the discovery of the newer antiepileptics—carbamazepine, the benzodiazepines,and vallproic acid. Interest has been renewed in this high-fat diet by television shows and videotapes sponsored by parent groups. The mode of action is unknown, but seizure control may be correlated directly with elevated levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate that result from ketosis. Children who have complex myoclonic epilepsy associated with tonic-clonic convulsions are most likely to respond to the diet. For those who do respond, it often is possible to decrease or discontinue most, if not all, anticonvulsants, so that the child inevitably becomes brighter and more responsive. The use of valproic acid is contraindicated in conjunction with the ketogenic diet because the latter potentiates the hepatotoxicity of the former. The ketogenic diet may be appropriate for the child who has recalcitrant seizures despited polytheraphy, in whom an underlying cause of the seizure is unknown. Because the diet is unpalatable and has a high fat content, some children beyond the age of 1 to 2 years will not tolerate it. The ketogenic diet usually is continued for a period of 2 years in children who have good seizure control.Surgery is gaining increasing popularity as a method of treatment children who have focal seizures unresponsive to anticonvulsant therapy. The assessment of children for possible surgery must be conducted in a tertiary center by a skilled pediatric epileptologist in a multidisciplinary setting. Following routing EEGs,prolonged EEG recording with video monitoring is imperative to localize the site(s) and identify the frequency of epileptogenic discharges. Many centers use subdural electrodes to define the extent of the epileptogenic activity more accurately. These studies often are accomplished by decreasing or discontinuing the anticonvulsant drugs to promote frequent seizures, which increases the reliability of locating the seizure focus.In addition to the EEG studies,the child undergoes a series of other proceduresto assist in localization of the seizure focus and identification of the dominant cerebral hemisphere, including neuropsychologic evaluation, the Wada test (intracarotid injection of amobarbital),SPECT, PET in some centers, and MRI studies. These studies may identify a lesion corresponding to the focal seizure abnormality,including a low-grade glioma,hamartoma, or evidence of mesial temporal sclerosis. The results of epilepsy surgery in children who have a localized area of epileptogenic activity associated with a structural lesion is excellent. Temporal lobe resection is the most common surgery performed in children and adults; corpus callosotomy,hemispherectomy, and nontemporal lobe resections are more common in the younger child who has intractable seizures. Further development of electrophysiologic monitoring and advances in neurosurgery will allow more children who have focal seizures unresponsive to anticonvulsant therapy to benefit from epilepsy surgery.Appropriate and timely counseling of the parents and child is at least as important as choosing the correct anticonvulsant. Parents and patients who comprehend the purpose and side effects of anticonvulsant drugs as well as their action are much more likely to be compliant and supportive. At the time of diagnosis, the family often is overwhelmed and does not know where to start. It is useful initially to review the causes of epilepsy and explain the need for an EEG and additional studies if warranted. This consultation also provides an opportunity to dispel various myths about epilepsy.Subsequently visits should focus on factors that may exacerbate seizures,including a low-grade fever, undue stress, lack of sleep, and certain drugs such as methylphenidate and the phenotiazines. On occasion,anticonvulsants, particularly carbamazepine and phenytoin, may potentiate seizures. The physician should review first-aid measures that can be initiated at home if a seizure occurs. I recommend that the child not bathe or swim unattended because a seizure could result in drowning. However, the pediatrician should encourage participation in all activities, including contact sports if the patient desires, as long as appropriate protective equipment is used. Because adolescents who have epilepsy are primarily concerned about obtaining a driver’s license,the pediatrician should be aware of state laws governing driver’s licenses for people who have epilepsy. It is imperative that school teachers be made aware of children who have epilepsy because the children are at risk for learning disorders and require careful surveillance to identify situations in which special assistance is needed.The diagnosis of epilepsy frequently affects the family negatively. The parents are frightened that their child might die during a seizure,develop brain damage as a consequence of recurrent seizures, or have significant irreversible side effects from the anticonvulsant. Many parents feel guilty and vulnerable,particularly if there is a family history of epilepsy. If their fears and questions are not addressed adequately, a parent may tend to isolate the child,which will cause greater anxiety and family discord. The pediatrician must respond to the psychosocial needs of such a family. Most parents benefit from reading material produced by the Epilepsy Foundation of America and by participating in parent meetings sponsored by local epilepsy organizations. Time should be set aside at each follow-up visit to address concerns relating to any academic, social, or behavioral problems. As the parents become more familiar with the many facets of epilepsy, their confidence will grow and ability to cope will improve.Most children who have epilepsy are well-controlled on anticonvulsant medication with few if any side effects, have normal intelligence,and can be expected to lead normal lives. The pediatrician can play a pivotal role in ensuring that the child who has epilepsy reaches his or her highest potential.SUGGESTED RESOURCES FOR PARENTS AND CAREGIVERSFreeeman JM, Vinning EPG, Pillas DJ.

It is usual to associate a benzodiazepin with an opioid, more often Midazolam and Morphine or Fentanyl; other drugs as Propofol, Clonidine and Ketamine have specific indications, brief painful procedures and weaning from long periods of sedation to avoid withdrawal. Sometimes it can be useful to add a neuromuscular blocking agent to help mechanical ventilation. Adverse sedation events are relatively frequent, associated with drug overdoses and drug interactions, particularly when 3 or more drugs are used: all class of medications and all routes of administration are involved.",

      "abstract": "A mood disorder is a chronic illness, associated with episodic recurrence over time (1,2); when a patient experiences a new mood episode, explore possible underlying causes of that recurrence. The mnemonic RELAPSE can help you take an informed approach to treatment, instead of making reflexive medication changes (Table, page 54). [R]hythm disturbances. Seasonal changes, shift work, jet lag, and sleep irregularity can induce a mood episode in a vulnerable patient. Failure of a patient's circadian clock to resynchronize itself after such disruption in the dark-light cycle can trigger mood symptoms. [E]nding treatment. Intentional or unintentional non-adherence to a prescribed medication or psychotherapy can trigger a mood episode. Likewise, switching from a brand-name medication to a generic equivalent can induce a new episode because the generic drug might be as much as 20% less bioavailable than the brand formulation. (3) [L]ife change. Some life events, such as divorce or job loss, can be sufficiently overwhelming--despite medical therapy and psychotherapy--to induce a new episode in a vulnerable patient. [A]dditional drugs. Opiates, interferon, steroids, reserpine, and other drugs can be depressogenic; on the other hand, steroids, anticholinergic agents, and antidepressants can induce mania. If another physician, or the patient, adds a medication or supplement that causes an interaction with the patient's current psychotropic prescription, the result might be increased metabolism or clearance of the psychotropic--thus decreasing its efficacy and leading to a new mood episode. [P]hysical health changes. Neurologic conditions (epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, stroke), autoimmune illnesses (eg, lupus), primary sleep disorders (eg, obstructive sleep apnea), and hormone changes (eg, testosterone, estrogen, and thyroid) that can occur over the lifespan of a patient with a mood disorder can trigger a new episode. [S]ubstance use and withdrawal. Chronic use of alcohol and opiates and withdrawal from cocaine and stimulants in a patient with a mood disorder can induce a depressive episode; use of cocaine, stimulants, and caffeine can induce a manic state. [E]nd of drug response. Some patients experience a loss of drug response over time (tachyphylaxis) or a depressive recurrence while taking an antidepressant.

Ergebnisse Psychische Beeinträchtigungen/Störungen können als Reaktion auf chronischen Pruritus auftreten, z. B. als Anpassungsstörungen, depressive Störungen, Angststörungen. Psychische Faktoren können auch in Entstehung und Verlauf eines chronischen Pruritus eine Rolle spielen, entweder im Zusammenspiel mit organischen Ursachen oder bei deren Fehlen als somatoformer Pruritus oder Pruritus bei coenästhetischer Schizophrenie. Ferner können selbstinduzierte Kratzartefakte mit oder ohne Pruritus im Rahmen von Störungen der Impulskontrolle, Zwangsstörungen oder Artefaktstörungen auftreten. Auch eine primär unabhängige Komorbidität mit einer sonstigen psychischen oder psychosomatischen Störung kann das Management des Pruritus erschweren und den Krankheitsverlauf beeinflussen. Es werden Hinweise zur Diagnostik der genannten Faktoren gegeben. Diskussion Die Diagnostik psychischer Einflussfaktoren und psychischer Aspekte des chronischen Pruritus ist komplex. Das wichtigste diagnostische Werkzeug ist die gründliche Anamneseerhebung auch bezüglich psychischer Aspekte. Zusätzlich können psychometrische Instrumente zum Einsatz kommen, die das ärztliche Gespräch jedoch nicht ersetzen.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disturbances are frequent at menopausal transition and substantially affect the quality of life in midlife women. Diagnosing and treating sleep disturbances are essential parts of the management of menopausal symptoms. Persistent insomnia in midlife is not a single entity, and is not always linked with menopause per se. Detailed patient history supplemented with appropriate physical examination and diagnostic tests is the basis for correct diagnosis. Insomnia in midlife women can be divided into four major categories: (1) menopausal insomnia (often related to climacteric vasomotor symptoms); (2) primary (psychophysiologic) insomnia; (3) secondary insomnia (associated with other sleep disorders (e.g., sleep-disordered breathing), mental (e.g., anxiety or depression) or medical (e.g., fibromyalgia) disorders or aging; and (4) insomnia induced by behavioral, environmental, or psychosocial factors. Careful evaluation of the nature of the menopausal insomnia will help choosing the best therapy for each individual. Treatment options for menopause-associated insomnia include hormone therapy, behavioral interventions as well as medication targeting the specific underlying medical condition (such as pain, anxiety, or depression). Conventional hypnotic agents rarely provide long-term benefit in chronic forms of insomnia. This chapter provides a practical approach to diagnosis and treatment of menopausal insomnia.",

      "title": "Behavioural Effects of Anti‐epileptic Drugs",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY There is increasing evidence that various types of behavioural disturbance, other than those described for phenytoin, for example, may occur from the use of anti‐epileptic medication, and it has been suggested that these disturbances may not always be reversible. There are suspicions also that certain groups of patients—especially those with structural brain damage—are particularly susceptible. These and other factors relevant to the study of the effects of anti‐epileptic drugs on behaviour are comprehensively reviewed. It is concluded that the psycho‐pharmacology of anti‐epileptic drugs is unsatisfactory at present because of inadequate and unsophisticated reporting of behavioural change and because of the common problem of polypharmacy, and that more accurate observations are needed on less heterogeneous groups of patients than have been described in the past. RÉSUMÉ Effets des medications anti‐épileptiques sur le comportement Il devient de plus en plus évident que des types variés de troubles du comportement, autres que ceux traditionnellement attribués à la phénytoïne, par exemple, peuvent suivre l'emploi de medication anti‐épileptique; il a même été suggéré que ces troubles ne sont pas toujours réversibles. Certaines indications laissent à penser que certains groupes de malades, notamment ceux qui présentent des troubles cérébraux structuraux, sont particulièrement sensibles. Ces faits et les autres facteurs relevant d'une étude de l'action des médications anti‐épileptiques sur le comportement sont systématiquement analysés. L'auteur concluent qu'à l'heure actuelle la psychopharmacologie des médications anti‐épileptiques n'est pas satisfaisante en raison de rapports inadéquats et non qualifiés sur les troubles du comportement ainsi que sur le problème commun des associations médicamenteures. Il est indispensable de disposer d'observations plus précises, de groupes de malades moins hétérogènes que ce qui a été fait dans le passé. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Verhaltenseinflüsse von Antiepileptika Es gibt zunehmend Hinweise darauf, daß verschiedene Arten von Verhaltensstörungen, andere als die zum Beispiel traditionell vom Diphenylhydantoin beschriebenen, bei der Anwendung von Antiepileptika auftreten können; es wurde vermutet, daß die Störungen nicht in alien Fällen reversibel sein könnten. Es gibt weiterhin Vermutungen, daß eine bestimmte Gruppe von Patienten—besonders solche mit strukturellen Hirnschädigungen—im besonderen dafür empfänglich sind. Es wird eine umfassende Übersicht dieser und anderer, für diese Studie der Effekte antikonvulsiver Medikamente auf das Verhalten relevanter Faktoren gegeben. Es wird festgestellt, daß die Psychopharmakologie der Antikonvulsiva zum gegenwärtigen Zeitpunkt unzureichend ist, da adäquate und sorgfältige Berichte über Verhaltensanderungen und die allgemeinen Probleme der Polypharmazie fehlen; es werden genauere Beobachtungen an weniger heterogenen Patientengruppen benötigt, als sie bisher beschrieben sind. RESUMEN Efectos sobre la conducta de los fármacos antiepilépticos Hay una evidencia creciente de que diversos tipos de alteraciones en el comportamiento, además de los ya tradicionalmente descritos para la fenitoína por ejemplo, pueden aparecer por el uso de medicación antiepiléptica, y se ha sugerido que estas alteraciones no siempre pueden ser reversibles. Hay sospechas también de que algunos grupos de pacientes, especialmente aquellos con lesión estructural cerebral, sen particularmente susceptibles. Se revisan de forma complet estos y otros factores en relación con el estudio de los efectos de los fármacos antiepilépticos sobre el comportamiento. Se concluye que la psicofarmacología de los fármacos antiepilépticos no es satisfactoria en el momento presente debido a unas comunicaciones inadecuadas o no sofisticadas sobre los cambios del comportamiento y el problema común de la polifarmacia, y que es necesaria una observación más atenta en grupos de pacientes menos heterogéneos de los que han sido descritos en el pasado.",

      "abstract": "Les patients hospitalises en reanimation presentent frequemment des troubles neurologiques (troubles de la vigilance, troubles du sommeil, dysfonctions cognitives multiples, confusion mentale), psychologiques (anxiete, depression, syndromes delirants), des syndromes douloureux et de l'inconfort. Ces troubles ont en commun : la problematique de leur definition et de leur reconnaissance par l'equipe de reanimation, leur expression frequente par un comportement d'agitation, une association avec la reponse de stress post-agressive rencontree au cours des pathologies traitees en reanimation. La physiopathologie de ces troubles est complexe, impliquant a la fois la pathologie qui a determine l'hospitalisation du patient en reanimation, ses antecedents medicaux, mais aussi la reanimation elle-meme par les therapeutiques invasives qui y sont utilisees, ainsi que la sedation medicamenteuse ou le coma artificiel. En outre, ces troubles peuvent etre associes dans leur expression comme dans leur determination, certain pouvant etre cause ou consequence d'un autre. L'objectif de cette these etait de montrer qu'une prise en charge diagnostique et therapeutique rationalisee de la douleur, des troubles neurologiques et psychologiques etait associee a un meilleur pronostic du patient en reanimation.",

In the clinical situation, sedation is an undesirable secondary effect after the utilization of these drugs. It is for this reason that sedative drugs are used in pre-anaesthesia or agitation, or even aggressive phenomena. The purpose of this article is therefore to highlight the different pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of drugs which can be used to induce sedation.",

      "abstract": "The neurologic dysfunction underlying epilepsy can predispose patients to psychiatric disorders, and the incidence of both depression and psychosis is increased in people with epilepsy. Depressive disorders are the most frequently recognized psychiatric comorbidities in people with epilepsy, but depression in children can be particularly difficult to recognize. Clinicians need to inquire about not only classic symptoms of depression such as anhedonia but also less obvious symptoms such as unprovoked irritability, unsubstantiated complaints of lack of love from family members, somatic complaints, and problems with concentration and poor school performance. The diagnosis of depressive disorders in children with epilepsy and mental retardation is even more difficult. Physicians need to be alert for the presence of iatrogenic depression, which may result from antiepileptic drugs or epilepsy surgery. People with epilepsy are also at increased risk for psychosis, which can be interictal, postictal, or (rarely) an expression of ictal activity. This psychosis can be related to seizure remission (ie, alternative psychosis) or iatrogenic (eg, related to antiepileptic drugs or following temporal lobectomy). Although both antidepressants and antipsychotic drugs have the potential to lower the seizure threshold and increase seizures, careful drug selection, dosing, and slow titration can minimize this risk, allowing treatment to proceed.

      "abstract": "Abstract Schizoaffective disorder was first described in the literature by Kasanin in 1933, referring to a group of patients in whom both psychotic (“schizo”) and mood (“affective”) symptoms are prominent features. A formal diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder requires that (1) a mood episode (major depressive, manic, or mixed) co‐occurs with active schizophrenia symptoms; (2) hallucinations or delusions have occurred for at least 2 weeks in the absence of prominent mood symptoms; (3) the mood symptoms are present for a substantial portion of the total active and residual phases of schizophrenia; and (4) the symptoms are not related to the direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition. Schizoaffective disorder can be further broken down into two subtypes: depressive type (if the mood component consists of only major depressive episodes) and bipolar type (if a manic or mixed episode is part of the mood component). Because loss of interest or pleasure also resembles another common symptom of schizophrenia (i.e., anhedonia), the other essential feature of a major depressive episode, pervasive depressive mood, must be present in the depressive type of schizoaffective disorder.",

      "title": "Consciousness disorders in schizophrenia:a forgotten land for psychopathology",
      "abstract": "The scientific study of consciousness has been boosted in the last two decades, especially from philosophical and neuroscientific realms. Before that, the topic was neglected, particularly in psychiatry in which, either out-of-consciousness experiences were emphasized (as in psychoanalysis) or consciousness was viewed as epiphenomenic to the underlying organic disorders that had to be studied. This situation has hardly improved in modern psychiatry, perhaps due to the persistence of two competing metaphors of consciousness and of psychiatric constructs (such as kraepelinian dementia praecox) from which consciousness disorders were originally excluded. Accordingly, the role of a disordered consciousness in schizophrenia, which nevertheless was contemplated by Continental psychiatry, has hardly been considered by recent psychopathology research. However, there is growing data showing that certain functions that modern science considers to be part of consciousness (sense of agency, self, episodic and autobiographic memory, executive functions, insight, monitoring) could be impaired in certain schizophrenics and that this may account for symptoms such as thought insertion, depersonalisation, auditory hallucinations, self fragmentation, disorders of episodic and working memory, passive experiences and delusions of control. In this paper the conceptual history of consciousness in psychology, neurology and psychiatry is outlined, and the most prominent recent approaches to the study of its role in schizophrenia are reviewed.",

      "title": "Computational Deglutition: Using Signal- and Image-Processing Methods to Understand Swallowing and Associated Disorders [Life Sciences]",
      "abstract": "Swallowing is a sensorimotor activity by which food, liquids, and saliva pass from the oral cavity to the stomach. It is considered one of the most complex sensorimotor functions because of the high level of coordination needed to accomplish the swallowing task over a very short period of 1-2s and the multiple subsystems it involves. Dysphagia (i.e., swallowing difficulties) refers to any swallowing disorder and is commonly caused by a variety of neurological conditions (e.g., stroke, cerebral palsy, Parkinson disease), head and neck cancer and its treatment, genetic syndromes, and iatrogenic conditions or trauma. The signs and symptoms of dysphagia range from anterior loss of food while eating, difficulty chewing, and subjective difficulty swallowing food or liquids to choking or coughing before, during, or after eating because of impaired clearance of swallowed material from the throat into the digestive system. When not effectively treated, dysphagia can cause malnutrition, dehydration, immune system failure, psychosocial degradation, and generally decreased quality of life.",

The functions of the great nerve centres, including the brain and spinal cord, as also those of the nervous system generally, are liable to be seriously influenced, weakened or interrupted, for periods of uncertain duration, by the occurrence of an attack of typhoid fever. Among the sequels or complications that have been observed is dementia, insanity, loss of sight, aphasia, paraplegia and other forms of paralysis. Sometimes only one limb, as a leg or an arm; rarely, only an arm and a leg at the same time. At other times disturbances are limited to the functions of speech.

The misalignment between the internal circadian timing system and the external environment is typically due to either an alteration in the functioning of the circadian timing system (e.g., delayed or advanced sleep phase syndrome) or to changes in the external environment (e.g., jet lag). However, the clinical presentation of most of the circadian rhythm sleep disorders is influenced by a combination of physiological, behavioral, and environmental factors. These disorders lead to complaints of insomnia and excessive daytime sleepiness, with impairment in important areas of functioning and quality of life. Current treatments primarily involve the use of circadian synchronizing agents, such as light, to realign the internal and external environment. These treatments are limited by the availability of adequate diagnostic tools and well-controlled clinical trials. A better understanding of the pathophysiology of these disorders is required to develop more effective treatments.",

      "title": "Hyperventilation Syndrome: A Review",
      "abstract": "This article has dealt with the psychophysiological phenomenon known as \"hyperventilation syndrome.\" Published research on this syndrome dates back at least a century to Da Costa's classic investigation involving \"soldier's heart\". Various labels such as \"effort syndrome,\" \"anxiety neurosis,\" \"neurocirculatory asthenia,\" \"vasoregulatory asthenia,\" and \"irritable heart,\" have been employed over the past century to describe this syndrome. The use of different labels to describe this syndrome seems to be inappropriate. While the symptoms associated with these diagnostic labels appear to be remarkably similar, the treatment for the syndrome often differs as a function of the diagnostic label. Symptoms include breathlessness or dyspnea with effort, parathesia, trembling, tachycardia, tetany, carpopedal spasms, and convulsions in the case of a full-blown attack. Hyperventilation, a normal consequence of vigorous exercise and/or high temperatures, can often occur in some individuals for no apparent reason. Hyperventilation, and the resulting physiological changes, are often associated with decrements in psychomotor performance along with increased error rates. The symptoms which characterize the hyperventilation syndrome can be readily produced in certain \"types\" of individuals within minutes by requiring the individual to overbreathe or through introduction of a CO2 challenge. The symptoms, once produced, can be quickly reversed by placing a paper sack over the subject's head and requiring him/her to rebreathe expired air. Overbreathing and CO2 challenges do not, however, produce full-blown hyperventilatory attacks in most individuals. That is, some individuals or \"types\" appear to be especially sensitive to the effects of overbreathing and/or CO2 loading.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

      "abstract": "\"Neurally-mediated (reflex) syncope\" refers to a reflex response that, when triggered, gives rise to vasodilation and/or bradycardia; however, the contribution of each of these two factors to systemic hypotension and cerebral hypoperfusion may differ considerably. The initial evaluation may lead to a certain diagnosis in the case of classical vasovagal syncope and of situational syncope. Classical vasovagal syncope is diagnosed if precipitating events such as fear, severe pain, emotional distress, instrumentation or prolonged standing, are associated with typical prodromal symptoms. Situational syncope is diagnosed if syncope occurs during or immediately after urination, defecation, cough or swallowing. In the absence of a certain diagnosis, absence of cardiac disease, long history of syncope, syncope after sudden unexpected unpleasant sight, sound or smell, prolonged standing at attention or crowded, warm places, nausea and vomiting, post-prandial and post-exercise state suggest a neurally-mediated cause which needs to be confirmed by specific tests. Among them, the most useful are carotid sinus massage and tilt testing. In general, education and reassurance are the sufficient initial treatment. Additional treatment may be necessary in high-risk or high-frequency settings. Treatment is not necessary in patients who have sustained a single syncope and are not having syncope in a high-risk setting. It is valuable to assess the relative contribution of cardioinhibition and vasodepression before embarking on treatment as there are different therapeutic strategies for the two aspects. Even if evidence of utility of such an assessment exists only for the carotid sinus massage, it is recommended to extend this assessment also by means of tilt testing or implantable loop recorder. Tilt training and isometric leg and arm counterpressure maneuvers are indicated in patients with recurrent vasovagal syncope. Cardiac pacing is indicated in patients with cardioinhibitory or mixed carotid sinus syndrome and in patients with cardioinhibitory vasovagal syncope with a frequency > 5 attacks per year or severe physical injury or accident and age > 40 years. The evidence fails to support the efficacy of any drug.",

      "title": "Seizures And Epilepsy",
      "abstract": "Abstract Seizures occur in 10% of people at some time during their lives. Seizures are sudden, discrete episodes of abnormal behavior caused by abnormal hypersynchronous firing of neurons in the cerebral cortex. They are classified as generalized when both hemispheres are involved or partial ( focal) when limited to an area in one hemisphere. Commonly recognized generalized seizure types are generalized tonic-clonic seizures (formerly called grand mal) and absence seizures (formerly called petit mal). Other types of generalized seizures are tonic, atonic, and myoclonic seizures as well as most infantile spasms. Under the right (or wrong) metabolic conditions, anyone can have a seizure. Relevant conditions include numerous metabolic and nutritional abnormalities. About 0.5%–1% of people have epilepsy. This is the underlying chronic condition that predisposes the individual to have seizures. Epilepsy can be either symptomatic (secondary) when there is a known underlying brain abnormality (such as a stroke or a brain tumor) or idiopathic (primary) when it occurs in an otherwise normal individual without other symptoms or signs of a brain disorder. The most common time for epilepsy to develop is in the first year of life; over half of epilepsy cases develop before 21 years of age. Another peak in epilepsy onset occurs in older age due to the accumulation of brain insults from such conditions as stroke, trauma, and tumors. Potential causes of epilepsy in infants and children include acute brain-injuring insults like perinatal asphyxia, sepsis, and hypoglycemia, as well as chronic causes like brain malformations and genetic disorders.",

      "title": "Composers - Substance Abusers",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONThe aim of this article is to emphasize and summarize pathographies of eminent composers, 77 of them, who were substance abusers. In this section we can divide them into three groups as follows: substance abusers who suffered from primary alcoholism, secondary alcoholism, and those who were alcohol and/or tobacco, drugs abusers. Most of them had different anxiety and depressive disorders (neurosis, panic disorder, cyclothymia, manic depressive disorder).1Substance abuse is the use of alcohol, tobacco and/or illegal drugs in a way that is harmful for health. Most of the composers mentioned in this article were alcohol abusers. Alcoholism is a syndrome of physical dependence on alcohol, whose sudden deprivation may cause withdrawal symptoms - tremor, anxiety, hallucinations and delusions (delirium tremens). Alcoholism impairs intellectual functions, physical skills, memory, judgment and social skills, such as conversation. Heavy consumption or alcohol abuse also causes following complications and diseases of different organs and systems, for example cardiovascular - cardiomyopathy, congestive heart failure; nervous system - neuritis, funnicular myelosis, cerebral atrophy; gastrointestinal tract - gastropathy, ulcers, portal hypertension, acute and chronic pancreatitis, enteritis, cirrhosis of the liver etc. There are many substance abusers, but only a few of them (Dussek, Mysliveoek, Mussorgsky etc.) suffered primarily from alcoholism to such extent that their careers were interrupted and stopped because of alcohol abuse. Therefore they were unable to finish their creative work.11 In this journal we previously published pathographies of the following composers: J.C. Bach, W.F. Bach, Beethoven, Berlioz, Brahms, Debussy, Glinka, Gluck, Handel, Liszt, Mozart, Mussorgsky, Puccini, Ravel, Schonberg, Schubert, Sibelius, Tchaikovsky, Wolf.COMPOSERS AND RESULTS1. Pietro Marc Antonio Cesti(1623-1669) Italian composer and conductor who was born in Arezzo and studied with various local musicians. In 1637 he joined the Franciscan order. While he was in Volterra he turned more toward secular music, probably due to the patronage of the powerful Medici family. There he also came in contact with Salvator Rosa who wrote librettos for a number of Cesti' s cantatas. By 1650 Cesti' s calling as a monk and his success as a singer and composer of operas were coming into conflict so he was officially reprimanded. In 1652 he became a court member in Innsbruck. After holding a post somewhere in Florence as maestro di cappella, he entered the papal chapel in 1660. In 1666 he became Vice-Kapellmeister in Vienna. He was described as unstable, stubborn, quarrelsome and often seeking confrontation. He had frequent disagreements with other musicians. His frequent changes of living places were caused by his conflicting nature and connected with his alcohol abuse because of which he had problems with the society. His health was impaired because of alcohol abuse, so he died at the age of 46 in Venice as a result of complications of alcoholism, probably poisoned by his rivals in Florence.2-82. Carl Ditters von Dittersdorf(1739-1799) Austrian violinist and composer who was born in Vienna. He was a brilliant musician of great technical skills and soon became a member of the court chapels held by prince Sachsen - Hildburghausen, and later of another held by Bishop Adam Pataoic. Afterwards he was active in Breslau - Wroclaw and again in Vienna. He was a member of the royal orchestra and later a capelmeister in service of Bratislava Duke. He cooperated with J. Haydn and W.A. Mozart extensively. His musical drama »A doctor and a chemist« became very famous and was even compared to Mozart's »Figaro«. He was a master of »Singspiel«; he composed more than forty of them, and comic operas. He led a decadent life, eating and drinking excessively. He was one of the last composers living that kind of life. Later, he suffered from uric arthritis and hemorrhoids, what is more, he became almost paralyzed. …",

Catatonia has been associated with psychiatric disorders - schizophrenia and bipolar disorder for example - as well as secondary to various underlying medical conditions.It will be described a case report of a 55 years old woman with prior psychiatric history of hospitalization with an unspecified nonorganic psychosis (F29-ICD10), presenting features of catatonia - immobility with fixed posture and gaze (sometimes presenting posturing), an almost absence of spontaneous movements and speech, echophenomenon (echolalia, palilalia, coprolalia) erupting in a otherwise mute state and showing, on occasions, periods of purposelessness motor excitement and restlessness, verbigeration and screaming with a grim of terror. She was disoriented and performed poorly on the MMSE. No neurologic focal signs were disclosed other than prominent primitive reflexes. Prior to admission, her family reported a sudden mood change: she became irritable, argumentative, with delusional thought content of persecutory nature, grandiose ideas. Viral and immune-mediated encephalitis were discharged. The MRI scan showed a right temporal medial lesion (amygdala atrophy). It will be addressed the hypothetical relationship between the dramatic clinical presentation and the cerebral lesion, grounded on the scientific research regarding limbic encephalitis, catatonic symptoms and neurophysiology. It will also be underscored the clinical relevance of differentiated psychopathology of catatonia.",

      "title": "Primera convulsión en apirexia",
      "abstract": "La informacion acerca de las caracteristicas del episodio critico generalmente es obtenida de un testigo casual, muchas veces un familiar, que vive el evento con mucha angustia y temor. Asimismo, los sucesivos interrogatorios pueden ir modificando el relato del episodio, afectando la calidad de la informacion obtenida. Por lo tanto, debe tenerse en cuenta la enorme importancia que tiene la realizacion de una historia clinica completa desde la primera consulta, en lo posible por un medico con conocimientos y experiencia clinica en el tema, y que la misma este orientada por el razonamiento clinico para poder formular los sucesivos diagnosticos en forma precisa. Cuando un nino tiene un episodio con manifestaciones clinicas que se inician y finalizan en forma mas o menos brusca, el mismo se clasifica como un evento paroxistico. Si se presume que dicho evento es el resultado de una descarga neuronal anormal y excesiva, se considera una crisis de mecanismo epileptico, diferenciandolo de otros tipos de eventos paroxisticos no epilepticos como los sincopes, los espasmos del sollozo, las migranas o las crisis psicogenas (conversivas o pseudocrisis). Cuando el evento paroxistico de mecanismo epileptico se caracteriza principalmente por contracciones musculares involuntarias, ya sean mantenidas (tonicas) o interrumpidas (clonicas), se le denomina crisis convulsiva o convulsion. Si las primeras manifestaciones clinicas de la convulsion orientan a que inicialmente se produjo una activacion neuronal anatomica o funcional de una parte de un hemisferio cerebral, la crisis se clasifica como parcial. Por el contrario, en las crisis generalizadas los primeros cambios clinicos indican un compromiso inicial sincronizado de ambos hemisferios, con perdida de conocimiento desde el inicio de la crisis, y no hay evidencia clinica, electroencefalografica o de otro tipo que sugiera un inicio focal o parcial. El siguiente paso es fundamental en la elaboracion diagnostica, y consiste en determinar si existe una probable causa aguda que pueda haber precipitado la convulsion. Estas causas agudas pueden ser neurologicas, como en el caso de los ninos que presentan una infeccion del sistema nervioso central (SNC) en curso (meningoencefalitis o encefalitis agudas), un tumor encefalico, o las crisis que ocurren en los siete dias siguientes a un accidente cerebrovascular o a un traumatismo craneoencefalico. Las crisis tambien pueden ser precipitadas por una causa sistemica como la fiebre en las convulsiones febriles, por causas metabolicas como las alteraciones electroliticas –que se pueden presentar, por ejemplo, en un lactante con una diarrea aguda–, u otras causas metabolicas como una hipoglucemia o la hipoxia, cualquiera sea su etiologia. Tambien puede precipitarse una crisis por la repercusion encefalica de la hipertension arterial, o por una intoxicacion que puede ser producida por medicamentos –teofilina, imipramina– o por drogas como el alcohol o la cocaina (o por su supresion brusca), o por exposicion a toxicos ambientales como el monoxido de carbono o los organofosforados. La presencia o ausencia de cualquiera de estas causas agudas permite clasificar las crisis en provocadas (tambien denominadas sintomaticas agudas u ocasionales) o no provocadas, respectivamente. Las crisis no provocadas pueden presentarse en ninos con una enfermedad neurologica previa que aumente sustancialmente el riesgo de crisis de mecanismo epileptico, como puede ser una encefalopatia no progresiva resultado de una lesion cerebral producida previamente por un sindrome hipoxico-isquemico, una meningoencefalitis o una encefalitis, una enfermedad cerebrovascular o un traumatismo de craneo grave. En estos casos, las crisis se denominan no provocadas o secundarias. Menos frecuentemente, las crisis no provocadas pueden presentarse en ninos portadores de un trastorno progresivo del SNC. Sin embargo, en la mayor parte de los casos las crisis no provocadas se presentan en ninos en los cuales no LOS EXPERTOS RESPONDEN Arch Pediatr Urug 2002; 73(4): 233-235",

      "abstract": "Abstract Conversion disorder (previously called hysteria) describes neurological symptoms such as paralysis, movement disorder, or sudden collapses that are genuine but not related to disease. Although affected patients may appear to have a neurological disease such as multiple sclerosis or epilepsy, no structural disease process is evident, nor are symptoms deliberately feigned. Instead, brain function is disordered; hence, current preference for the term “functional neurological disorder.” Conversion symptoms exist at the interface between neurology and psychiatry and remain a common cause of disability and distress. The conundrum of hysteria was essential to the development of Freudian psychoanalytic theory, which today is only one of many competing hypotheses to explain these intriguing symptoms.",

      "title": "Depression and anxiety: Distinguishing unipolar and bipolar disorders",
      "abstract": "The use of steroids and supplements can complicate the clinical picture in a young man with mood swings, anxiety, and depression referred for psychiatric evaluation by his primary care clinician and a psychologist. Identifying information: A 20-year-old single man was referred by his primary care physician and a psychologist for medical management of mood swings, anxiety, and confusion. Chief complaint: The patient reported unremitting sadness that had lasted more than a year, and said that he generally felt dead inside or like a zombie. He was often ruminative and irritable, with difficulty concentrating. History of present illness: The young man's sadness and disagreeable sensations were relieved only for periods of 3 to 4 days when he felt more worried than sad. It was during these intervals of worry that he grew more ruminative, tired, and irritable, and said he could not sort out his thoughts. The patient could not recall when he last felt well enough to have fun with friends. He ruminated about the past, often trying to change it in his mind and thereby causing himself to become confused about what was real and what he might have imagined to be real. In particular, he was preoccupied with the recent loss of a relationship with a girl, which began in high school. He blamed the loss on his moodiness. However, he also acknowledged that he briefly dated her younger sister, a short time after which the girlfriend abruptly stopped returning his calls, telling him it was payback for dating her sister. The patient spent a great deal of time online looking at his ex-girlfriend's MySpace social-interaction page, which only caused him to feel worse. He blamed himself for everything that was wrong in his life and struggled with thoughts that people were talking and thinking about him negatively. Because he believed he was physically too small, he exercised regularly to stay in good shape. Medications and allergies: The referring primary care physician and psychologist had prescribed sertraline 100 mg/d for 3 weeks. They then switched him to venlafaxine 225 mg/d, which he took for 4 to 5 weeks. However, the patient stopped taking both drugs on his own initiative because they made him feel numb, and he also thought they made him feel more depressed. In the week before the initial psychiatric evaluation, his father had given him some sleeping medications because he was often tense, keyed up, and unable to relax in the evenings and around bedtime. They did not help. Otherwise, this young man had not been taking any medications during the previous 6 months. Psychiatric history: The patient had never been hospitalized and denied any suicidal or homicidal ideation. As mentioned, he sometimes thought he could undo the past by some ritualistic rnental action. The young man was an only child and spent a lot of time talking about this. He denied any history of childhood trauma. However, he held an unusual suspicion that his parents were hiding a birth defect from him, and that this defect was in some manner related to his current issues and difficulties. He did not give any more details about this suspicion, saying, Every time I ask them about it, they tell me I'm crazy and just make a joke about it. His mother reported that it took about 10 years to conceive, but there were no complications with the pregnancy or delivery. The patient received no intervention during the first 6 months of the current episode, when his family doctor was contacted. The doctor referred the patient to a psychologist for counseling, and the psychologist quickly referred him back to the doctor, believing that the young man needed a prescription for antidepressant medication. His mother said he was drinking alcohol more regularly while on his medications, and that he was probably not fully compliant with the antidepressant regimens. He was never prescribed benzodiazepines for his anxiety and tension, apparently due to concern about abuse potential. …",

      "abstract": "Patients with insomnia complain of problems with sleep onset or sleep maintenance or early morning awakenings, or a combination of these, despite adequate opportunity and circumstances for sleep. In addition, to fulfill the diagnostic criteria for insomnia the complaints need to be associated with negative daytime consequences. For chronic insomnia, the symptoms are required to be present at least 3 days per week for a duration of at least 3 months. Lastly, for insomnia to be defined as a disorder, the sleep complaints and daytime symptoms should not be better explained by another sleep disorder. This criterion represents a diagnostic challenge, since patients suffering from other sleep disorders often complain of insomnia symptoms. For instance, insomnia symptoms are common in e.g., obstructive sleep apnea and circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders. It may sometimes be difficult to disentangle whether the patient suffers from insomnia disorder or whether the insomnia symptoms are purely due to another sleep disorder. Furthermore, insomnia disorder may be comorbid with other sleep disorders in some patients, e.g., comorbid insomnia and sleep apnea (COMISA). In addition, insomnia disorder is often comorbid with psychological or somatic disorders and diseases. Thus, a thorough assessment is necessary for correct diagnostics. For chronic insomnia disorder, treatment-of-choice is cognitive behavioral therapy, and such treatment is also effective when the insomnia disorder appears comorbid with other diagnoses. Furthermore, studies suggest that insomnia is a heterogenic disorder with many different phenotypes or subtypes. Different insomnia subtypes may respond differently to treatment, but more research on this issue is warranted. Also, the role of comorbidity on treatment outcome is understudied. This review is part of a Research Topic on insomnia launched by Frontiers and focuses on diagnostic and treatment challenges of the disorder. The review aims to stimulate to more research into the bidirectional associations and interactions between insomnia disorder and other sleep, psychological, and somatic disorders/diseases.",

The first patient had also used cocaine, cannabis and alcohol, while the second patient had only used the hallucinogenic mushrooms. Both patients were treated symptomatically and survived despite their severe stab wounds. Psilocybin-containing mushrooms are used as mind-altering drugs. These drugs may sometimes induce 'bad trips', a psychotic reaction accompanied by fear, panic, and dangerous behaviour, especially when used in combination with other drugs and alcohol or by psychiatrically unstable patients. During a bad trip, patients may hurt themselves. Because the duration of the psychotic and sympathicomimetic effects of psilocybin after ingestion of mushrooms is short (up to 6 h), and since psilocin itself causes no permanent organ toxicity, the treatment of psilocybin intoxication is only symptomatic. The diagnosis ofpsilocybin intoxication is hampered by the lack of routinely available, rapid and sensitive, analytical methods for the quantification ofpsilocybin and its active metabolite psilocin.",

The current management is also only symptomatic for type 2 narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia with an unknown pathophysiology. Treatment options may vary from a single drug targeting several symptoms or several drugs treating a specific symptom. The treatment of daytime sleepiness is based on modafinil in first intention. Other psychostimulants such as methylphenidate, pitolisant and exceptionally dextro-amfetamine may be considered. In narcolepsy type 1, antidepressants such as inhibitors of the reuptake of serotonin and noradrenaline will be considered to improve cataplexy. Sodium oxybate is an effective treatment on sleepiness, cataplexy and bad night sleep in narcolepsy. The management for other symptoms or comorbidities should be considered it necessary such as hallucinations, sleep paralysis, the disturbed nighttime sleep, unpleasant dreams, parasomnias, depressive symptoms, overweight/obesity, cardiovascular disease and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Important therapeutic perspectives are to be expected concerning new psychostimulant and anticataplectiques, but mainly on immune-based therapies administered as early as possible after disease onset and on hypocretin replacement therapy for patients with severe symptoms.",

      "abstract": "The symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder comprise various obsessions and compulsions with rituals, sensory abnormalities, doubts, overvalued ideas, speech abnormalities, emotional disturbances (depression, anxiety, irritability and others), immediate memory deficits and minor (soft) neurological signs. Actually, obsessive-compulsive disorder is a heterogeneous syndrome that includes subtypes that overlap with both anxiety and mood disorders. Although new findings on obsessive-compulsive disorder allow the development of theories on the etiology and suggest therapeutic approaches, new pathways are still being sought to explain the intriguing enigma of obsessions. The search for biological markers in obsessive-compulsive disorder is relatively new, as most literature in this field has been produced in the past decade. The major hypothesis on the pathophysiology of obsessive-compulsive disorder relates to serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine), on the basis of an almost exclusive response to serotonergic drugs by patients with the disorder. Furthermore, in recent years a growing number of neuropsychiatric studies have documented an impairment in both cognitive and sensory motor functions in obsessive-compulsive disorder. Together with neuroimaging studies and neurosurgical research, some neuroanatomical models of obsessive-compulsive disorder have been developed. These models have focused on reciprocal connections between frontal cortex and basal ganglia. Advances in brain-imaging techniques (positron emission tomography (PET), single-photon computed tomography, magnetoencephalography, functional magnetic resonance) and the development of specific radiolabeled serotonergic ligands should allow the in-vivo visualization of structure-function relationship, and may lead to a better understanding of this illness.",

Herpes zoster, especially acute herpes zoster, is associated with the reactivation of the inactivated varicella zoster virus in individuals who have had chickenpox. PHN is associated with persistent and often refractory neuropathic pain. Patients may experience several types of pain, including deep pain, intolerable pain, burning, paroxysmal pain, stabbing pain, hyperalgesia, and allodynia. Pharmacological treatment of PHN may include a variety of drugs, including alpha-2 delta ligands (gabapentin and pregabalin), other anticonvulsants (carbamazepine), tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline, nortriptyline, doxepin), topical analgesics (5% lidocaine patch, capsaicin) tramadol, or other opioids. The sizeable side effect profile of commonly used oral drugs often limits their practical use, and a combination of topical and systemic agents may be required for optimal results.

Zu beurteilen sind die körperlichen Voraussetzungen, nämlich die Gebrauchsfähigkeit von Armen und Beinen, das Sehvermögen und das Gleichgewicht sowie geistige (psychische) Voraussetzungen, nämlich die (visuelle) Wahrnehmungsfähigkeit, die Aufmerksamkeit und die Belastbarkeit. Zu deren Überprüfung werden in der Regel geeignete, objektivierbare psychologische Testverfahren verlangt. Festgestellte Eignungsmängel können unter Umständen durch entsprechende Hilfsmittel, Kfz-Umbauten oder durch eine besonders erfahrene, vorausschauende und sicherheitsbewusste Fahrweise kompensiert werden. Nicht kompensiert werden können homonyme Hemianopsie, persistierende Doppelbilder bei Geradeausblick, unvorhersehbar attackenförmig auftretender Schwindel, visuelles Hemineglektsyndrom sowie charakterliche Mängel. In der Beurteilung bei speziellen Krankheitsbildern ist immer vom Einzelfall auszugehen. Von einer Einschränkung der FE ist auszugehen, wenn eine Verkehrsgefährdung durch die Erkrankung/Symptomatik in konkreten Fahrsituationen anzunehmen ist, sodass ein Unfall mit hoher Wahrscheinlichkeit eintreten kann. Derartige Gefährdungssituationen entstehen durch Einschränkungen der körperlichen oder geistigen Leistungsfähigkeit, unvorhersehbar auftretende Störungen der Leistungsfähigkeit oder mangelnde Einsicht in Gefahren und Risiken.

The diagnosis of dizziness includes not only an evaluation of vestibular dysfunction, but also a psychogenic evaluation. Using this approach, the following three different patterns of dizziness should be carefully identified: psychogenic, otogenic, and interactive. The common somatic symptoms in patients with chronic dizziness (N=145) were investigated using questions designed to assess headache, insomnia, diarrhea, constipation, stomachache, chest pain, palpitations, dyspnea, and general fatigue. The prevalent somatic symptom in patients with dizziness included general fatigue, insomnia, and headache. These symptoms are very similar to those reported for patients with anxiety and depression. Patients with dizziness clearly had several somatic complaints related to anxiety or depression that could be attributed to the dizziness. Treatments included pharmacotherapy and physical therapy (including rehabilitation for vestibular dysfunction), surgical intervention, pharmacotherapy, and psychotherapy for anxiety and depression. Pharmacotherapy using serotonin reuptake inhibitors and psychotherapy, such as autogenic training, were also performed.",

Objectives We report the case of a male patient aged 58 with multiple previous admissions for behavioral alteration symptoms, including exhibitionism. He is referred as irritable, uninhibited and sleeping disorders. There is a risk of flight as he is difficult to be held so it is feared that he can be run over by a car. He shows a marked self-referentiality. Methodology The patient is admitted. He properly gets used to the rules of the Ward. Pharmacological adjustment is performed. During his admittance he shows no behavior disorders neither episodes of self or hetero aggression and poor impulse. He properly makes comments of what happened during his stay. He responds well to treatment prescribed. Sleep pattern is restored. Results Schizophrenia (undifferentiated) 295.90 (F.20.3); intellectual disability mild 317 (F70); neurocognitive disorder (possible). Conclusions This is unusual case because it is normal that the sexual function of such patients is adversely affected, not finding numerous cases of disinhibition in our medical consultation. This is due to the different aspects that are affected, biological (drugs), psychological and social levels. We have different therapeutic alternatives to address this problem. However, they may hinder sociability and patient rehabilitation. Disclosure of interest The authors have not supplied their declaration of competing interest.",

      "title": "Anosognosia",
      "abstract": "Abstract Anosognosia refers to a state in which patients with brain injury deny their disabilities or lack awareness of their deficits. The relationship of anosognosia to other behavioral disorders is complex. Many authorities view the phenomenon as part of the spectrum of the neglect syndrome. Others emphasize the parallels between anosognosia and confabulatory behavior. Anosognosia also bears some resemblance to disorders of body schema such as asomatognosia or autotopagnosia. Several descriptions of anosognosia were published before Babinski coined the term in 1914 (Babinski, 1914). As introduced, anosognosia referred only to lack of awareness or recognition of a specific neurologic disturbance (i.e., hemiparesis). Subsequently, the term has been applied more broadly to describe unawareness of any neurological or neuropsychological deficit (Fisher, 1989). A wide variety of clinical syndromes have been associated with anosognosia, including visual loss (hemianopia or cortical blindness), amnesia, dementia, aphasia, cortical deafness, movement disorders (hemiballismus, chorea, tardive dyskinesia), apraxia, and thought disorders associated with schizophrenia.",

      "abstract": "Acute agitation is a common presenting symptom in the emergency ward and is also dealt with on a routine basis in psychiatry. Usually a symptom of an underlying mental illness, it is considered urgent and immediate treatment is indicated. The practice of treating agitation on an acute care basis is also referred to as rapid tranquilization. A variety of psychotropic drugs and combinations thereof can be used. The decision is usually made based on availability and the clinician’s experience, with the typical antipsychotic haloperidol (alone or in combination with antihistaminergic and anticholinergic drugs such as promethazine), the benzodiazepines lorazepam, diazepam and midazolam as well as a variety of atypical antipsychotics being used for this purpose. Haloperidol is associated with extrapyramidal symptoms (which can be controlled by co-administration of promethazine) and may control agitation without inducing sedation, while benzodiazepines have a more pronounced sedating activity. The atypical antipsychotics aripiprazole and ziprasidone are better tolerated, while olanzapine is also a powerful sedative. Clinical trials evaluating the efficacy of different treatment options have been conducted but they are extremely heterogenous and most have numerous methodological flaws, leading to a poor overall quality of evidence upon which guidelines for the appropriate treatment could be based. The combination of haloperidol and promethazine, which combines the sedative properties of the antihistamine with the more selective calming action of haloperidol (with a reduced risk of extrapyramidal effects compared to haloperidol alone because of the anticholinergic properties of promethazine) may be the best choice based on empirical evidence.",

      "abstract": "The medication guidelines for fibromyalgia (FM) and neuropathic pain (NP) were mainly based on scientific evidence of analgesic efficacy in the literature. From a scientific viewpoint, it is justified, however, it does not necessarily agree with clinical priority. Adverse effects slightly affect these guidelines. Most adverse effects that were considered in the development of guidelines for NP including FM were short-term adverse effects such as drowsiness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, dysuria, and dry mouth. However, the long-term adverse effects such as cognitive dysfunction, dependence or abuse, sexual dysfunction, fracture, and osteoporosis also should be considered in medication. The adverse effects of pregabalin are cognitive dysfunction, dependence or abuse, obesity, marked drowsiness (sometimes loss of consciousness), and an expensive drug price. The adverse effects of duloxetine are cognitive dysfunction, dementia, sexual dysfunction, and bleeding and the drug price is expensive. Tricyclic antidepressants are safer than serotonin noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors in terms of dementia or cognitive dysfunction. The price of amitriptyline is inexpensive and most adverse effects except obesity disappear as soon as it is discontinued. Many studies have shown the analgesic effect of amitriptyline in FM and NP. However, scientific evidence of efficacy is low, because they are old studies. In clinical practice, efficacy based on personal experience, adverse effects based on personal experience and scientific evidence, drug price, and degree of offlabel use in addition to scientific evidence of efficacy should be reflected in the order of priority. Pregabalin and duloxetine should be administered after amitriptyline in medication treatment for NP including FM.",

      "title": "Epilepsy and Behavior",
      "abstract": "Abstract Epilepsy is a recurring behavioral, sensory, or subjective experience caused by an abnormal electrical discharge in the brain. Though abnormal electrical changes accompany seizures of any kind, they may not be reflected in the electroencephalogram (EEG) between seizures and sometimes epileptic EEG discharges occur in the absence of clinically apparent seizures. Generalized seizures always cause a disturbance in consciousness and the EEG is virtually always abnormal during such seizures. Partial seizures may not be associated with unconsciousness, with any abnormal movement, or with an epileptiform, scalprecorded EEG, even during the episode. It may not always be clear how much of a patient’s behavior can be attributed to epilepsy and there may be disagreement among competent neurologists as to the relation of abnormal behavior to the seizure state. In such cases, a therapeutic trial of anticonvulsants may appear to resolve the medical problem, but the pragmatic definition of epilepsy as abnormal thought and behavior that resolves with the use of antiepileptic medications is medically and scientifically weak. Mental symptoms in mania and other disorders can improve during therapy with antiepileptic drugs in patients who do not have epilepsy.",

Sleep deprivation has a significant impact on the optimal functioning of the immune system. Fibromyalgia is a rheumatoid syndrome of unknown etiology that is characterized by chronic musculoskeletal pain and generalized muscular tenderness. An intimate link between pain, mood, and sleep is apparent. Serotonin is one common denominator in each of the neurochemical processes, and is one candidate that may explain the underlying pathophysiology. Perhaps the role of cognitive-behavioral treatments ought to be tested, as both depression and chronic pain tend to be responsive to cognitive and behavioral interventions. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome is a condition of unknown etiology characterized by fatigue that persists for more than 6 months and presents with several of the following symptoms: impaired memory or concentration, pharyngitis, tender lymph nodes, non-restorative sleep, and malaise after physical exertion that extends beyond 24 hour.",

Excessive anxiety and situational avoidance leads to diminution of performance and limitation of endeavour. In the context of physical illness, anxiety increases the distress of symptoms, may confuse diagnostic procedure, prolong recovery time from acute illness, cause failure to comply with effective treatment and promote destructive habits such as reliance on alcohol or excessive use of sedative drugs.",

The clinical and psychopathological method was used to assess the therapeutic reduction of productive symptoms. The results obtained show that haloperidol can be used to relieve exacerbations of paranoid schizophrenia in outpatient practice. The approach to choosing haloperidol may be based on the type of psychotic episode.

Under the influence of factors such as the decline of the 18th-century Cullean concept of neurosis, the development of the new descriptive psychopathology, the introduction of statistics, and the availability of longitudinal observations of hospitalized cohorts, epilepsy was redefined as a \"neurological\" disease by the 1850s. The reaction of psychiatry to the exclusion of the mental disorder as a defining feature of epilepsy manifested itself in the creation of the \"masked epilepsy\" concept. This notion is behind the later development of categories such as \"borderland\" and \"equivalent,\" which are still of some relevance to 20th-century views of epilepsy.",

      "title": "Psychotic Disorders",
      "abstract": "The term “psychotic disorders” refers to a broad conceptualization of conditions including primary psychoses, such as schizophrenia and psychotic mood disorders, other disorders that are sometimes marked by psychotic features (e.g., borderline personality disorder, body dysmorphic disorder), and secondary psychotic disorders due to medical conditions or substances (e.g., alcohol withdrawal delirium). As addressed in Ketter, et al. 2004 (“Psychotic Bipolar Disorders: Dimensionally Similar to or Categorically Different from Schizophrenia?,” cited in the Debate of Dimensional versus Categorical), controversy regarding relationships among mood disorders (particularly bipolar and depressive disorders with psychotic features) and schizophrenia is ongoing. The authors argue that while the respective dimensional (e.g., psychotic bipolar disorder as intermediate between non-psychotic bipolar and schizophrenia spectrum disorders) versus categorical debate persists, a mixed dimensional/categorical approach may best help elucidate pathophysiology and treatment options. Schizophrenia, specifically, is a severe and persistent form of mental illness often marked by positive symptoms (such as excesses and distortions in thoughts and sensory/perceptual experiences such as hallucinations and delusions), negative symptoms (behavioral deficits such as avolition, asociality, anhedonia, blunted affect, and alogia), disorganized symptoms (such as disorganized speech and behavior), movement symptoms (or grossly abnormal psychomotor behavior such as catatonia), and impairments in cognition (such as memory and frontal/executive functions that include, for example, planning ability and initiation). Kring, et al. 2014 (Abnormal Psychology, cited under the Schizophrenia Spectrum) provides an excellent introductory-level overview of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. The etiological (or causal) basis of schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders remains not wholly determined. Prevailing theories, however, ascribe to a diathesis-stress model, whereby biological factors (e.g., predispositions such as genetic liability) are believed to interact with adverse environmental factors (e.g., obstetric complications; adverse, stressful life events) over the course of development toward the manifestation of illness. This article offers a historical perspective of psychotic disorders, a review of etiological/theoretical models, a description of illness epidemiology and issues pertaining to sex differences and comorbidity, an outline of diagnostic considerations, a description of the schizophrenia spectrum, an examination of available assessment tools, the role of cognition/social cognition, a review of current evidence of neurobiological disruptions in psychosis (e.g., genetics, structural and functional neuroimaging, hormones, neurotransmitters, other aspects of maldevelopment in the central nervous system), other laboratory markers (e.g., perceptual and attentional abnormalities, smooth-pursuit eye movement dysfunction), environmental factors (such as stress, toxins, and familial-expressed emotion), the importance of gene-environment interactions in psychotic disorders, and, finally, current directions pertaining to prevention and treatment (pharmacological and psychosocial). While various psychotic-related disorders are addressed, this article focuses on the schizophrenia spectrum.",

      "title": "TRANSITORY SCHIZOPHRENIAS PRODUCED BY BROMIDE INTOXICATION",
      "abstract": "A bromide psychosis is one which starts during bromide intoxication and clears up fairly soon—usually several weeks, though sometimes longer—after discontinuance of the drug. Four varieties of bromide psychosis are known: 1. Simple intoxication, marked by dullness and mental sluggishness, with good orientation, and without delusions or hallucinations. 2. Delirium, marked by disorientation, thinking disturbances, mood disturbances (usually fear), delusions, hallucinations and other symptoms. The first two varieties are well known; the next two are not. 3. Hallucinosis, which differs from delirium in that orientation is intact. 4. Schizophrenia, a psychosis of predominantly paranoid coloring which, to the examiner who does not know the history and laboratory findings and has not yet seen the outcome, has all the earmarks of an \"ordinary\" paranoid schizophrenia, from which it differs only in that it is a transient psychosis which has supervened during bromide intoxication. Sometimes a bromide schizophrenia is accompanied by disorientation, a symptom which does not belong to the schizophrenic picture. In such cases it is believed that the bromide schizophrenia came first, and that delirium ensued subsequently because the drug was not stopped. Such cases are to be distinguished from those \"ordinary\" schizophrenics who, because of pre-existing psychotic symptoms, start taking bromide and take it long enough to become delirious. Anyone who takes enough bromide may become delirious, and there is nothing remarkable when this happens to an ordinary schizophrenic. It is quite different with the patient who was not manifestly schizophrenic until bromide made her so. Bromide schizophrenia differs from bromide delirium and hallucinosis in the following respects (leaving aside for a moment the basic difference between delirium and other psychoses in respect to orientation): 1. Bromide schizophrenia occurs by preference in persons with strong schizoid leanings, while delirium and hallucinosis show no such preference. 2. The characteristic schizophrenic disturbance of rapport is not found in delirium and hallucinosis. 3. The content of the schizophrenia, as in any ordinary schizophrenia, has a flavor of the bizarre: ideas of influence and mind-reading, ideas of electricity and somatic distortions are apt to be prominent. 4. In schizophrenia the patient's delusions and hallucinations are marked by heightened self-reference, which is not the case to the same degree in delirium and hallucinosis. It is concluded that bromide intoxication has the power to bring to the surface a latent schizophrenia, which, when favorable conditions have been restored, may once again go into hiding. In this respect bromide intoxication resembles many other intoxications. It is wise to examine the serum for bromide routinely in every acute psychosis, rather than to do so only \"when indicated.\" If the test is not made routinely, one will overlook some cases, for sometimes one does not suspect a bromide psychosis until an unexpected recovery has opened one's eyes, at which point it may be too late to verify the diagnosis chemically.",

Patients who are intoxicated are more likely to be injured in traumatic accidents, and there is a significant association between having a SUD and injury from physical trauma. Risk-taking behavior associated with drug use can lead to sexually transmitted diseases and other infections, including those acquired through injection drug use (e.g., cellulitis, endocarditis, HIV, hepatitis C virus [HCV]). SUDs are more prevalent in patients who have depression or anxiety disorders or other psychiatric comorbidities (including personality disorders) and in those who use tobacco or alcohol. Patients with a dual diagnosis (i.e., both SUD and another major psychiatric disorder) may present with complex clinical histories and symptoms that make diagnosis challenging. Intoxication and withdrawal symptoms may be mistaken for other psychiatric or medical symptoms. Hospitalization may be prolonged by delirium due to intoxication or withdrawal.",

This last symptom can be considered as an unspecific sign of brain-damage. For the disturbance of voluntary lid opening/closure, the term ,,cortical palsy\" of lid movements is proposed. Thus this symptom can be differentiated from other supranuclear disorders of lid movements where reflectory and/or spontaneous lid movements are also impaired. As in all cases reported, the elementary motility of the eyelids (opening and closure) is impaired, it is not possible to ascertain whether a lid-apraxia is present.",

The clinical diagnosis of PD is defined by bradykinesia and other cardinal motor features, although several nonmotor symptoms are also related to disability, an impaired quality of life, and shortened life expectancy. Levodopa, which is used as a standard pharmacotherapy for PD, has limitations including a short half‐life, fluctuations in efficacy, and dyskinesias with long‐term use. There have been efforts to develop complementary and alternative therapies for incurable PD. Yokukansan (YKS) is a traditional herbal medicine that is widely used for treating neurosis, insomnia, and night crying in children. The clinical efficacy of YKS for treating behavioral and psychological symptoms, such as delusions, hallucinations, and impaired agitation/aggression subscale and activities of daily living scores, has mainly been investigated in the context of neurological disorders such as PD, Alzheimer’s disease, and other psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, YKS has previously been found to improve clinical symptoms, such as sleep disturbances, neuropsychiatric and cognitive impairments, pain, and tardive dyskinesia. Preclinical studies have reported that the broad efficacy of YKS for various symptoms involves its regulation of neurotransmitters including GABA, serotonin, glutamate, and dopamine, as well as the expression of dynamin and glutamate transporters, and changes in glucocorticoid hormones and enzymes such as choline acetyltransferase and acetylcholinesterase. Moreover, YKS has neuroprotective effects at various cellular levels via diverse mechanisms. In this review, we focus on the clinical efficacy and neuropharmacological effects of YKS. We discuss the possible mechanisms underpinning the effects of YKS on neuropathology and suggest that the multiple actions of YKS may be beneficial as a treatment for PD. We highlight the potential that YKS may serve as a complementary and alternative strategy for the treatment of PD.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The term reversible dementia is often a misnomer for other syndromes which globally impair cognitive function such as acute and subacute confusional state and subcortical dementia. Evidence from studies on the investigation of dementia and case reports of conditions traditionally held to cause reversible dementia (normal pressure hydrocephalus, vitamin B 12 deficiency, subdural haematoma) suggest that cortical dementia is not often a treatable syndrome. Acute or subacute confusional states and subcortical dementia are more typically associated with treatable or reversible causes of brain dysfunction. Diagnosis of these syndromes may identify those patients (especially those of advanced years) who should be extensively investigated.",

Confusion, agitation, and wandering can occur at night (“sun downing”), further contributing to sleep disruption (Box 10–1). Sleep complaints may be due primarily to the underlying dementia or to related sleep-disordered breathing, periodic limb movements of sleep, or secondary depression. Reversal of the sleep-wake rhythms can be seen with patients complaining of nocturnal insomnia and excessive daytime sleepiness. Polysomnography may demonstrate decreases in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep time and REM density. Sleep efficiency is reduced. Management includes proper sleep hygiene practices (eg, avoiding caffeine, maintaining a regular sleep schedule, and eliminating daytime naps), and treatment of concurrent depression and medical disorders, including pain syndromes, that might contribute to sleep disturbance. Short-term use of hypnotics, such as zolpidem, zaleplon, or eszopiclone, may be tried for insomnia.",

      "title": "Management of Acute Onset Catatonia Postpartum in a Patient With a History of Major Depressive Disorder With Psychotic Features: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "Catatonia is a rare but potentially life-threatening neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by a range of motor, behavioral, and affective abnormalities. Catatonia is broadly categorized into three clinical presentations: associated with a psychiatric disorder, secondary to a medical condition, or of unspecified origin. Postpartum catatonia remains poorly understood, particularly in cases where there is no active psychiatric or medical illness at the time of onset. Most documented cases occur in the context of severe peripartum mood or psychotic episodes, highlighting the unique nature of catatonia emerging independently in the postpartum period. In this case report, we present a 33-year-old woman with a known history of major depressive disorder with psychotic features who developed catatonia within 24 hours following childbirth. Notably, the patient exhibited no signs or symptoms of depression or psychosis during the pregnancy or at the time of catatonic onset. She denied experiencing any mood or psychotic symptoms leading up to delivery, and her presentation was not consistent with a relapse of her previous psychiatric condition. This case is notable for its unique context: catatonia emerging in the immediate postpartum period without concurrent psychiatric decompensation or identifiable medical triggers. It raises important clinical questions about whether postpartum physiological or hormonal changes alone may precipitate catatonia in vulnerable individuals, even in the absence of overt psychiatric illness. Our report underscores the importance of maintaining a high index of suspicion for catatonia in postpartum patients, including those without active psychiatric symptoms. Early recognition and treatment are critical for optimal outcomes. Furthermore, this case highlights the need for more research to better understand the spectrum of postpartum catatonia and to determine whether it may, in some instances, represent a distinct clinical entity separate from traditional psychiatric or medical frameworks.",

      "title": "Distinguishing subclinical (subthreshold) depression from the residual symptoms of major depression.",
      "abstract": "The terms ‘sub-clinical’ or ‘subthreshold’ are widely used in medicine to label individuals who are in the early stages of a disease process (e.g., cancer, hypertension, etc.) and to identify high-risk populations that need to be monitored or provided with specific preventative interventions or treatments. Because the pathophysiological changes that occur in the sub-clinical stages of a condition are similar to those that occur during the full-blown disease, sub-clinical states are usually considered prodromal versions of the disease under consideration.\r\n\r\nBased on this usage, subclinical or subthreshold depression should refer to an individual who has not previously met full criteria for major depression who currently experiences depressive symptoms that are not severe enough or persistent enough to merit a diagnosis of major depression. Using this concept, a recent two-year follow-up study found that subthreshold depression can predict the subsequent occurrence of depressive disorders (OR=6.23, 95% CI=3.31-11.74) or anxiety disorders (OR=3.47, 95% CI= 1.78-6.78).[1]\r\n\r\nUnlike other medical disciplines, in clinical psychiatry the sub-clinical and subthreshold labels are also used to describe residual clinical states after the partial remission of a full episode of a condition. For example, ‘sub-clinical depression’ is often used to describe the clinical state of a patient who has not entered full remission and still has residual symptoms after treatment with antidepressants.[2],[3] I believe it important to distinguish these two situations. Prodromal depressive symptoms prior to the onset of a full-criteria major depression and the residual depressive symptoms after the partial resolution of a major depressive episode may be symptomatically similar but they are clinically distinct conditions that require different interventions so it is inappropriate to combine them under a single label. Residuals symptoms following a major depressive illness require continued pharmacological and/or psychotherapeutic treatment but sub-clinical depressive symptoms prior to the first occurrence of a major depressive illness usually only require observation and follow-up. More active treatment for sub-clinical depressive symptoms is usually only justified if they persist for two years or longer (in which case the diagnosis of Dysthymic Disorder is usually applied) or if the individual has had full-criteria major depressive illness in the past and thus is at a high risk of progressing to a full-criteria episode of illness.\r\n\r\nCollapsing these different situations under a single rubric is both inaccurate and could potentially lead to inappropriate treatment. I recommend that persistent depressive symptoms following a major depressive illness that do not meet the full criteria of the disorder be labeled ‘residual symptoms’ (not sub-clinical or subthreshold symptoms) and that the ‘sub-clinical depression’ or ‘subthreshold depression’ labels be limited to depressive symptoms that occur prior to the first onset of a full depressive episode. But depressive affect is part of the normal human condition so we must also avoid the inappropriate overuse of the sub-clinical and subthreshold labels by, for example, labeling the depressive symptoms identified in screening programs of healthy community members as ‘subthreshold depression’. Depressive symptoms in individuals without prior episodes of full-criteria depressive illness should only be given the sub-clinical or subthreshold labels if the symptoms are ‘clinically significant’, that is, when they result in significant distress or significant social or occupational dysfunction.",

      "title": "Familial Hemiplegic Migraine",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) falls within the category of migraine with aura. In migraine with aura (including FHM) the neurologic symptoms of aura are unequivocally localizable to the cerebral cortex or brain stem and include visual disturbance (most common), sensory loss (e.g., numbness or paresthesias of the face or an extremity), and dysphasia (difficulty with speech). FHM must include motor involvement, such as hemiparesis (weakness of an extremity). Hemiparesis occurs with at least one other symptom during FHM aura. Neurologic deficits with FHM attacks can be prolonged for hours to days and may outlast the associated migrainous headache. FHM is often earlier in onset than typical migraine, frequently beginning in the first or second decade; the frequency of attacks tends to decrease with age. Approximately 40%-50% of families with CACNA1A-FHM have cerebellar signs ranging from nystagmus to progressive, usually late-onset mild ataxia. Diagnosis/testing The clinical diagnosis of FHM can be established in a proband: (1) who fulfills criteria for migraine with aura; (2) in whom the aura includes fully reversible motor weakness and visual, sensory, or language symptoms; and (3) who has at least one first- or second-degree relative with similar attacks that fulfill the diagnostic criteria for hemiplegic migraine. The molecular diagnosis can be established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in ATP1A2, CACNA1A, or SCN1A. Management Treatment of manifestations: A trial of acetazolamide for individuals with CACNA1A-FHM or a trial of prophylactic migraine medications (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, antiepileptic medications) for all FHM types may be warranted for frequent attacks. Antiepileptic treatment may be necessary for seizures, which are prevalent in ATP1A2-FHM. Surveillance: Neurologic evaluation to assess change in attack frequency and/or seizures, annually or more frequently for worsening symptoms. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Vasoconstricting agents because of the risk of stroke; cerebral angiography as it may precipitate a severe attack. Genetic counseling FHM and simplex hemiplegic migraine caused by a heterozygous ATP1A2, CACNA1A, or SCN1A pathogenic variant are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Because the diagnosis of FHM requires at least one affected first-degree relative, most individuals diagnosed with FHM have an affected parent. Individuals with simplex hemiplegic migraine (i.e., individuals with an FHM-causing pathogenic variant and an apparently negative family history) may have a de novo pathogenic variant or a pathogenic variant inherited from an asymptomatic parent. Each child of an individual with FHM has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Once an FHM-causing pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

      "title": "Other Uses: Psychosis, Pregnancy, and Status Epilepticus",
      "abstract": "Although ECT was developed as a treatment for schizophrenia, its ease of use, its safety, and the lack of effective treatments for many psychiatric conditions encouraged experimentation with this therapy to treat other disorders. These explorations define a cluster of conditions— acute and chronic psychosis, psychiatric disorders in pregnancy and the postpartum period, and intractable seizure disorders—in which ECT has a clinical role. Strongly held beliefs (delusions), abnormal sensory experiences (hallucinations, illusions) that are not based upon reality, and beliefs that others are paying special attention or plotting harm to the subject (paranoid thoughts) impair social functioning and disrupt family life. Thought disorders are the central peculiarity of schizophrenia but are also frequently found in patients with depression, mania, toxic states, and brain disorders. Regardless of the cause or the associated signs and symptoms, treatment can reduce the psychosis. This benefit is often given small notice, however, because ECT is widely regarded as an antidepressant, not an antipsychotic, treatment. The relief of psychosis afforded by ECT varies with the underlying condition. Disorders in thought in patients with depression or mania are readily relieved. Indeed, the more severe form of psychotic depression is relieved more rapidly than nonpsychotic depression. When ECT is used to treat patients with malignant catatonia and delirium, the psychosis is relieved at the same time as the toxic state. When psychosis dominates the clinical condition without other features, schizophrenia is the usual diagnosis. For acute schizophrenia dominated by the positive symptoms of paranoia, catatonia, or excitement, ECT is quite helpful. It is not helpful for the chronic varieties dominated by passivity and withdrawal, the negative signs of the illness. The clinical approach to the diagnosis of a psychotic condition is to exclude other causes for psychosis first and reserve the label “schizophrenia” for the residue of “not otherwise diagnosed” psychotic conditions. While we are able to ameliorate the psychoses in mood disorders and toxic states, palliation and symptom reduction are the best that we can offer other psychotic patients. Electroconvulsive therapy and insulin coma therapy were the main treatments for psychosis at the time when Thorazine and other new antipsychotic drugs were introduced in the 1950s.",

      "abstract": "Drug addiction, also called substance dependence or dependence syndrome, is a condition where a person feels a strong need to take a drug. Addiction also involves other behaviors. These include finding it difficult to control the need to use the drug and feeling the use of the drug to be more important than more normal things such as family or work. When the person does not use the drug for an amount of time, they may suffer from withdrawal. When a person is addicted, they are usually addicted to a class (a specific kind) of drug. For example, Heroin is a drug that is in the Opiate class, which means that a person addicted to Heroin may also be seen to have an addiction to other opiates such as Morphine. A person who may easily become addicted to drugs is said to have an addictive personality. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders defines drug addiction as a mental disorder. Drug addiction is often linked with other mental disorders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\tIn the present book, fifteen typical literatures about drug addiction published on international authoritative journals were selected to introduce the worldwide newest progress, which contains reviews or original researches on human health, illegal drugs, neuroscience, psychology, ect.

      "title": "Migraine is not primarily a vascular disorder",
      "abstract": "There is no question that significant vascular changes may occur during a migraine attack. The question is whether these vascular phenomena are a cause or a consequence of migraine pathophysiology and migraine symptoms. While the simplistic appeal of the ‘vascular hypothesis’ of migraine has had remarkable staying power, studies of the clinical features of migraine, and its physiological and pharmacological mechanisms, have provided strong evidence that effectively refutes a primary role for the vasculature in migraine pathogenesis. It is important to start with the concept of migraine as not merely a headache, but rather a multi-faceted clinical phenomenon that can occur over hours to days. Diverse prodromal symptoms including yawning, mood change, neck pain and polyuria, among others, are common, and electronic diary studies have shown that these symptoms may occur up to several hours before the onset of headache (1). Aura symptoms include both positive and negative visual phenomena, and characteristic sensory or language dysfunction. Nausea, light and sound sensitivity, mechanical allodynia, vertigo and fatigue commonly occur before, during, or after headache. These symptoms indicate elaborate changes in brain chemistry and physiology – there is no reasonable explanation of these symptoms based on a primary vascular mechanism. Regarding migraine headache, the ‘vascular hypothesis’ is centered on the premise that migraine pain is caused by vasodilation. A variety of imaging and pharmacological studies, however, have directly challenged this concept. Pioneering blood flow studies performed by Olesen and colleagues (2) found that a migraine attack may include both hypoand hyperperfusion phases. These studies found that the headache component of the attack begins during the hypoperfusion phase and continues into the hyperperfusion phase, but the hyperperfusion may continue long after the headache has ended. Put simply, there is no correlation between blood flow changes and headache. Recent magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) studies have similarly shown no correlation between changes in vascular caliber and headache in either evoked or spontaneous migraine. Schoonman et al. (3) found that while nitroglycerin did evoke some cerebral and meningeal vasodilation, migraine headache did not occur until after the caliber of vessels had returned to baseline. Nagata et al. (4) reported that spontaneous migraine was not associated with any dilation of the middle meningeal artery as measured by MRA. Rahmann and colleagues (5) showed that vasoactive intestinal peptide is a potent dilator of cerebral vessels, yet does not cause headache. Conversely, sildenafil is known to evoke headache and migraine, but does not cause cerebral vasodilation or alteration in cerebrovascular function (6). Taken together, these studies clearly indicate that vasodilation is neither necessary nor sufficient to cause migraine headache. It has also long been assumed that the pulsating quality of migraine pain is a reflection of vascular pulsation. Recent studies by Ahn (7), however, call this assumption into question, suggesting that in most patients the rate of migraine pain pulsation is in fact slower than the arterial pulse rate. In some patients, the rates of pain pulsation were similar to the arterial pulse, but the two rates were observed to come in and out of phase over time. These studies raise the possibility that pain pulsation could be driven by a mechanism involving neural oscillations rather than by perception of the arterial pulse.

      "abstract": "Any systemic or neurological condition can cause sleep disruption. Diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) in particular may profoundly affect sleep initiation and maintenance by disrupting the structural and neurochemical substrates that regulate sleep. Medical conditions can lead to chronic insomnia in several ways. They may cause unpleasant stimuli, which in turn disrupt sleep continuity. They may produce changes in systemic physiology that are vital to sleep continuity (as with disorders of ventilation), or they may produce humoral changes that favor awakening (as in thyroid or adrenal disease). The incidence of insomnia increases with age as medical problems increasingly occur (1), and patients with chronic insomnia are more likely to develop adverse health outcomes due to medical disease(2). The effects of acute and subacute sleep disruption can lead to psycho-physiological insomnia by creating the anticipation of disturbed sleep and altering circadian rhythms, further accentuating the disruptive effects of the underlying medical condition. Difficulties with insomnia may persist long after the causative medical condition has been effectively managed.",

      "title": "The New Psychology of Pandemics",
      "abstract": "Abstract Pandemics are global outbreaks of novel or re-emerging infectious diseases. Pandemics will likely become more prevalent in the coming years due to climate change, the growing global population, and other reasons. Pandemics reveal aspects of humanity rarely seen in calmer times. Psychology plays an essential role in pandemics, in which people’s beliefs, emotions, and behaviors influence disease transmission, infection-related mental health problems, and societal disruption. Uncertainty is an inherent aspect of pandemics. When faced with novel pathogens, people cope with these invisible, uncertain threats in various ways, including coping strategies that provide only an illusion of control, making people calmer but not safer. Other psychological phenomena observed during pandemics include fear extremes (e.g. excessive fear vs. undue disregard for the threat), fleeing, panic buying, xenophobia, rumors and conspiracy theories, protests about wearing protective face masks, anti-vaccination attitudes, lockdown protests, increases in mood and anxiety disorders, and other problems. Efforts to manage one problem (e.g. lockdown to stem the spread of infection) may worsen others (e.g. mental health problems). The present volume offers an in-depth analysis of these and other issues concerning the psychology of pandemics. The book explores promising new directions for maintaining and improving mental health and enhancing adherence to pandemic mitigation measures. This book is intended for those working in psychology, healthcare, public health, and related fields—clinicians, researchers, policymakers, and students—as well as the general reader. To prepare for future global outbreaks of infectious diseases, we all would benefit from a better understanding of the psychology of pandemics.",

      "abstract": "The main objective of this study is to describe the different neuropsychological deficits associated to the consumption of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or 'ecstasy'), as well as the growing evidence that attributes these deficits to the selective axonal damage to serotoninergic cells brought about by this substance.MDMA is an amphetamine derivative that, like its precursor, has properties as a stimulant. Part of its chemical structure is similar to that of the hallucinogen mescaline with which it shares the capacity to alter perception. Nevertheless, the primary pharmacological effect of this substance, which is what usually leads to its use and abuse, is chiefly linked to an intense positive emotional state. This effect on the individual's mood is also usually accompanied by numerous feelings of empathy, sociability and closeness, which turn this drug into a powerful entactogenic agent (a term used in psychotherapy to describe a state of wellbeing, closeness and emotional self-awareness produced by certain compounds). The antidepressant and entactogenic effects induced by an acute dose of MDMA can be accounted for by the notable increase in serotonin bioavailability triggered by the drug. Repeated consumption of MDMA, however, ends up affecting many functions that have been related to the serotoninergic systems, such as sleep, appetite, attention and memory, or one's emotional state.Most of the neuropsychological disorders found in individuals who take ecstasy on a regular basis can be explained by the selective neurodegeneration processes that the drug appears to produce in the serotonin terminals of the brain in the long run.",

      "abstract": "Sir: Catatonia is a clinical syndrome characterized by alterations in motor behavior and changes in thought, mood, and vigilance 1 and occurs in a variety of medical and neuropsychiatric conditions. 2 Catatonia has been documented as occurring in alcohol withdrawal in rodents, 3 but not in humans.We report the case of a patient in whom alcohol withdrawal presented as catatonia.Case report.Mr. A, aged 35 years, presented in January 2006 with a history of alcohol use over the last 10 years.He fulfilled the DSM-IV criteria for alcohol dependence for the last 5 years.He presented with tremors, irritability, anorexia, and insomnia within 24 hours of abrupt cessation of alcohol intake.Seventy-two hours after cessation of alcohol intake, he developed signs of negativism, mutism, and psychomotor agitation lasting 2 days, followed by psychomotor retardation, stereotypies, and stupor over the next 2 days, fulfilling DSM-IV criteria for catatonia.There were no psychotic or mood symptoms, clouding of consciousness, disorientation, or any general medical condition that could explain these symptoms.He had experienced a similar episode 2 years previous, following 3 days of abstinence from alcohol, that remitted upon treatment with lorazepam.Family history was positive for alcohol dependence in first-and second-degree relatives but was negative for psychotic or mood disorders.The findings of laboratory investigations were within normal limits.As the patient's condition could not be described adequately by DSM-IV criteria for alcohol withdrawal or catatonia, the diagnosis of alcohol-induced psychotic disorder was made, with onset during alcohol withdrawal and presenting with catatonia.Mr. A was treated with lorazepam 16 mg per day and with vitamin supplements.His symptoms remitted completely within 72 hours.Catatonia has been documented in alcohol dependence in relation to drug interactions involving disulfiram 4 and in delirium. 1 The temporal correlation between alcohol abstinence and the appearance of catatonia in the absence of these other causes suggests that the catatonia in this case was due to alcohol withdrawal.Perturbations in γaminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic and glutamatergic transmission have been implicated in the pathophysiology of both catatonia 2 and alcohol withdrawal. 5,6 Furthermore, the GABA A modulator lorazepam is effective in both conditions. 1,7 To our knowledge, this case is the first such case reported in the literature.",

The occurrence of psychiatric symptoms in children does not reflect static disease entities, usually, but rather either diseases in process, which become evident in their final state in adulthood, or other social and cultural factors, such as abuse, trauma, and neglect. Attention deficit disorder (ADD) is not a disease in itself, usually, but rather a mistaken diagnosis when distractibility or impulsivity is caused by mood illnesses or anxiety states. Long-term randomized data with amphetamines indicate no greater functional benefit than with psychosocial interventions for ADD.

The pain is excruciatingly severe, unilateral (always on the same side), unaccompanied by visual phenomena, nausea/vomiting, hut accompanied by nasal congestien and lacrimation on the symptomatic side. The maximum pain is felt in the temporal region, although during severe attacks the entire hemicranium is involved through the neck, shoulder and homolateral arm in a diffuse way. The attack pattern differs clearly from that of cluster headache both with regard to attack frequency and the long term temporal pattern. In addition to blood and urine parameters and supplementary neurological/neuroradiological investigations, the following parameters were studied: Urinary histamine excretion (partly increased), kinin parameters (occasionally increased blood kinin and reduced blood kininogen), and corneal indentation pulse amplitudes (attack-induced increase, as in regular cluster headache). The following parameters rendered normal results: prostaglandins, cerebral blood flow, fluorescein appearance time, intrathecal pressure during and between attacks, and muscle biopsy with immunological investigation. The pain attacks can be abolished by continuous indomethacin medication. In spite of the ocular findings i t has in common with cluster headache, this headache seems to differ from cluster headache.",

      "abstract": "Summary Purpose: To consider the definition of acute symptomatic seizures for epidemiological studies, and to refine the criteria used to distinguish these seizures from unprovoked seizures for specific etiologies. Methods: Systematic review of the literature and of epidemiologic studies. Results: An acute symptomatic seizure is defined as a clinical seizure occurring at the time of a systemic insult or in close temporal association with a documented brain insult. Suggestions are made to define acute symptomatic seizures as those events occurring within 1 week of stroke, traumatic brain injury, anoxic encephalopathy, or intracranial surgery; at first identification of subdural hematoma; at the presence of an active central nervous system (CNS) infection; or during an active phase of multiple sclerosis or other autoimmune diseases. In addition, a diagnosis of acute symptomatic seizure should be made in the presence of severe metabolic derangements (documented within 24 h by specific biochemical or hematologic abnormalities), drug or alcohol intoxication and withdrawal, or exposure to well‐defined epileptogenic drugs. Discussion: Acute symptomatic seizures must be distinguished from unprovoked seizures and separately categorized for epidemiologic purposes. These recommendations are based upon the best available data at the time of this report. Systematic studies should be undertaken to better define the associations in question, with special reference to metabolic and toxic insults, for which the time window for the occurrence of an acute symptomatic seizure and the absolute values for toxic and metabolic dysfunction still require a clear identification.",

Dementia, psychoses, and emotional disorders, such as depression and anxiety/panic disorder, also impair behavior. Symptoms may be produced by dysfunction of the central nervous system, medication, and/or the psychosocial problems associated with Parkinson's disease. Treatment therefore should be based on the cause of the symptoms seen. In some cases, the reduction or change of antiparkinsonian drugs, or both, may be effective. Treatment of the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease, including motor fluctuations, may reduce the risk of panic attacks being evoked in the 'off' period. Use of antidepressants, sedatives, and neuroleptics may often be effective. Physicians should identify the causes of the symptoms of behavioral impairment and select appropriate treatments.",

Gastroesophageal reflux usually presents as recurrent vomiting in infants and young children. A small subgroup of infants develop apnea and cyanosis accompanied by posturing of the limbs, deviation of the eyes, or opisthotonos, which leads to the incorrect diagnosis of epilepsy. Breathholding spells and pallid infantile syncope, common in infants and young children, may also be mistaken for epileptic attacks. The parasomnias, including pavor nocturnus and somnambulism, are frequently mistaken for epilepsy, since these nocturnal episodes are paroxysmal in nature, may be associated with automatic behavioral mannerisms, and tend to be recurrent. Migraine is especially difficult to differentiate from epilepsy because its manifestations, particularly in children, are so diverse. Other disorders that may superficially mimic epilepsy include transient ischemic attacks, syncope, and transient global amnesia.",

O bruxismo e classificado como primario ou secundario. O bruxismo primario nao esta relacionado a nenhuma causa evidente, com evolucao a partir do seu aparecimento na infância ou adolescencia para a idade adulta. Ja o bruxismo secundario esta associado com transtornos neurologicos, como na doenca de Parkinson; psiquiatrico, nos casos de depressao; outros transtornos do sono, como a apneia; e uso de drogas, como as anfetaminas. O diagnostico do bruxismo e baseado no relato de ranger de dentes ocorrido durante o sono associado a dor ou tensao nos musculos da face ao acordar. O desgaste anormal dos dentes e a hipertrofia do masseter sao sinais que ajudam no diagnostico. Nao existe tratamento especifico ou cura para o bruxismo do sono. Uma assistencia multiprofissional pode propor diferentes linhas de tratamentos: tratamentos farmacologicos, psicologicos e odontologicos. O tratamento odontologico para o bruxismo e baseado nos ajustes oclusais, restauracao da superficie dentaria, tratamento ortodontico e placas oclusais miorrelaxantes. Objetivos: Explanar sobre o bruxismo do sono e suas complicacoes no sistema estomatognatico. Metodo: Foi realizada uma busca de artigos nacionais e internacionais nas bases de dados Pubmed, Scielo e Google Scholar entre os anos 2012 a 2018 que usaram como descritores as palavras: Bruxismo e bruxismo do sono. Conclusao: O bruxismo do sono ocorre em atividades nao funcionais do sistema estomatognatico e e reconhecido como uma parafuncao do sistema mastigatorio. O aumento de forcas proporcionado pelo bruxismo leva a cargas extras em todo o sistema estomatognatico, sendo que, como possivel resultado dessa situacao, ocorram danos a articulacao temporomandibular (ATM), musculos, periodonto e oclusao. Portanto, cabe ao cirurgiao-dentista conhecer o tema e identificar essa situacao em pacientes para que se recomende o tratamento mais efetivo em cada um deles. Mesmo com o avanco dos estudos acerca do tema, e possivel apenas minimizar seus efeitos deleterios, nao sendo capaz de evitar ou paralisar o bruxismo, mas entende-se que alguns fatores diminuem sua intensidade, enquanto outros a aumentam. Todavia, existe uma dificuldade de compreensao e controle desta parafuncao devido a sua multifatoriedade.",

D’abord, les diagnostics syndromiques sont modifiés. La définition de l’épisode dépressif caractérisé est simplifiée avec la suppression du critère d’exclusion lié au deuil. Ce choix, qui a pour but de mieux prendre en charge les dépressions post-deuil, a fait l’objet de nombreuses discussions et controverses. La définition de l’épisode maniaque ou hypomaniaque est également modifiée avec l’adjonction du symptôme modification de l’activité et de l’énergie [1]. Et les épisodes mixtes sont supprimés des diagnostics syndromiques et ré-intégrés comme caractéristiques spécifiques des troubles dépressifs ou bipolaires. Ce choix est secondaire aux excès antérieurs de diagnostics d’épisodes mixtes. Pour les chapitres troubles dépressifs [1] et troubles bipolaires [1], de nouvelles caractéristiques spécifiques apparaissent : les caractéristiques mixtes [1] (définies pour les épisodes dépressifs majeurs par la présence de 3 symptômes maniaques), les symptômes anxieux [1], et les caractéristiques spécifiques de risque suicidaire. Par ailleurs, de nouvelles entités sont introduites dans le chapitre troubles dépressifs [1]. Il s’agit du trouble dysphorique pré-menstruel, qui figurait auparavant dans l’appendice, et d’un nouveau trouble de l’enfant, le disruptive mood dysregulation disorder [1]. Enfin, dans le chapitre entités nécessitant de nouvelles études [1], apparaissent Ies épisodes dépressifs avec hypomanie de courte durée, le deuil pathologique complexe et persistant et les comportements suicidaires pathologiques. Ces différentes modifications devraient permettre, via leur remboursement, une meilleure prise en charge, aux États-Unis, du deuil pathologique, du risque suicidaire et du syndrome pré-menstruel pathologique.",

      "abstract": "The dopamine deficiency syndrome Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia and reduced postural reflexes. Conditions with similar symptoms but other causes than PD (about 1/3 of cases) are called atypical parkinsonism. From a neuropathological perspective, PD is associated with loss of nigro-striatal dopaminergic neurons (related to motor symptoms) and accumulation of alpha-synuclein-containing Lewy bodies in the mid-brain. Nigro-striatal pathways may also be involved in atypical parkinsonism, but lesions in other parts of the brain/basal ganglions dominate. Parkinsonism may also be related to chronic cerebrovascular disease or use of drugs with extrapyramidal side effects.Articles retrieved from PubMed were reviewed to examine current knowledge on diseases other than PD that can induce parkinsonism.Diseases with atypical parkinsonism usually start more symmetric than PD and tremor is either not present or differs from the typical rest tremor seen in PD. An exception is corticobasal degeneration with very asymmetric symptoms. Other (plus-) symptoms in atypical parkinsonism are (early) falling tendency, dizziness upon change of position, coordination difficulties or early cognitive decline. The article describes the clinical characteristics of atypical parkinsonism, possibilities of improved diagnostics with supplementary examinations and alternative treatment strategies.",

Slowing of the heart rate and weight gain are distinguishing features of tobacco withdrawal. Although nicotine withdrawal may not produce medical consequences, it lasts for several weeks and can be severe in some smokers. Like most other drug withdrawals, nicotine withdrawal is time‐limited, occurs in non‐humans, is influenced by instructions/expectancy and abates with replacement therapy and gradual reduction. Unlike some other drug withdrawal syndromes, protracted, neonatal or precipitated withdrawal does not occur. Whether nicotine withdrawal is associated with tolerance, acute physical dependence, greater duration and intensity of use, rapid reinstatement, symptom stages, cross‐dependence with other nicotine ligands, reduction by non‐pharmacological interventions and genetic influences is unclear. Whether nicotine withdrawal plays a major role in relapse to smoking has not been established but this is also true for other drug withdrawal syndromes.",

      "abstract": "Au sein de la schizophrenie, ce sont les symptomes negatifs qui retiennent le plus l'attention des cliniciens et des chercheurs, ceci pour des raisons historiques tout d'abord puisque ce sont ce type de symptomes que des auteurs comme kraepelin ou bleuler consideraient comme fondamentaux ; il continue, par ailleurs, a regner une confusion lorsque l'on utilise la terminologie symptomes negatifs et des termes aussi differents que negatif, deficitaire, residuel, type ii ou kraepelinien demeurent a tort interchangeables. Ces symptomes negatifs ne repondent pas ou peu aux neuroleptiques classiques ; surtout ils sont susceptibles d'etre la consequence, non pas uniquement du processus schizophrenique en tant que tel (symptomes negatifs primaires), mais egalement de facteurs comme la depression, l'anxiete, l'akinesie induite par les neuroleptiques, la suspicion, etc. (symptomes negatifs secondaires) et peuvent, s'ils ne sont ainsi differencies, bouleverser l'interpretation des resultats de certaines etudes. C'est pour contourner ce probleme que carpenter et son equipe ont propose le concept de syndrome deficitaire de la schizophrenie qui specifie la presence, chez un patient schizophrene, de symptomes negatifs prononces, durables et primaires. Un instrument d'evaluation nomme schedule for the deficit syndrome (sds) a ete concu pour faire le diagnostic de ce syndrome ; nous en avons realise la version francaise validee. Les resultats des etudes conduites a partir de l'utilisation de cet instrument, differenciant les groupes deficitaire et non deficitaire parmi des patients schizophrenes, fournissent une base solide pour postuler que cette forme deficitaire de la schizophrenie constitue une maladie distincte avec une etiologie, des symptomes, une evolution et des correlations neurobiologiques differents de ceux trouves chez les patients presentant la forme non deficitaire. Nous avons, en particulier, etudie 2 parametres biochimiques dans le compartiment plasmatique (acide homovanillique ; hva et 3-methoxy-4-hydroxy-phenylglycol ; mhpg) pour approcher les caracteristiques des systemes de neurotransmission dopaminergique et noradrenergique de chacune de ces formes de schizophrenie.",

Agents capable of precipitating dissociative-like states include alcohol, barbiturates and similarly acting hypnotics, benzodiazepines, scopolamine, clioquinol, β-adrenergic blockers, marijuana and certain psychedelic drugs, general anesthetics, and others. The presentations of substance-induced dissociative states may resemble those of functional dissociative disorders, or organic and psychogenic dissociative factors may coexist and be intertwined or indistinguishable. Organic dissociative states are distinct from intoxication, amnestic disorder, frank delirium, or other organic mental disorders as specified in DSM-III and DSM-III-R, yet these diagnostic manuals have no inclusive category or coherent nosological approach to dissociative states not strictly psychogenic in etiology. Substance-induced and other organic dissociative disorders can have clinical, medicolegal, and neuropsychological significance. They provide a unique opportunity for the study of mind-brain relationships and should be included in psychiatric nosology.",

Emotional control, when we consider that almost always the patient, if an adult, knows he is suffering from a very serious disease, is usually better than would be expected. When, then, mental symptoms do occur, three questions arise: (1) Is the abnormal mental state a mere accidental complication, merely happening at the time of the tetanus and in no way caused by it? (2) Is it due to the medication employed? (3) Is it the direct result of the exhaustion produced by the disease or a result of a secondary intoxication set up by the primary intoxication of the tetanus bacillus?

      "abstract": "Acute respiratory failure is a common complication of drug abuse. It is more likely to develop in the setting of chronic lung disease or debility in those with limited respiratory reserve. Drugs may acutely precipitate respiratory failure by compromising respiratory pump function and/or by causing pulmonary pathology. Polysubstance overdoses are common, and clinicians should anticipate complications related to multiple drugs. Impairment of respiratory pump function may develop from central nervous system (CNS) depression (suppression of the medulla oblongata, stroke or seizures) or respiratory muscle fatigue (increased respiratory workload, metabolic acidosis). Drug-related respiratory pathology may result from parenchymal (aspiration-related events, pulmonary edema, hemorrhage, pneumothorax, infectious and non-infectious pneumonitides), airway (bronchospasm and hemorrhage), or pulmonary vascular insults (endovascular infections, hemorrhage, and vasoconstrictive events). Alcohol, cocaine, amphetamines, opiates, and benzodiazepines are the most commonly abused drugs that may induce events leading to acute respiratory failure. While decontamination and aggressive supportive measures are indicated, specific therapies to correct seizures, metabolic acidosis, pneumothorax, infections, bronchospasm, and agitation should be considered. Drug-related respiratory failure when due to CNS depression alone may portend well, but in patients with drug-related significant pulmonary pathology, a protracted course of illness may be anticipated.",

A hierarchy moving from feelings through emotions, moods, and affective state to temperament involves increasing complexity in terms of state of mind and usually to an increasing duration of that state. Delusion involves abnormal beliefs that arise in the context of disturbed judgements and an altered experience of reality. Depersonalisation and derealisation are assumed to arise from a disruption in the functions of consciousness to create amnesia, dissociative identity disorder and depersonalisation disorder.

Careful assessment of patients is necessary to determine whether a co-occurring disorder is due to substance use or a separate diagnosis that requires independent treatment.

Several efforts have been guided by the neurodevelopmental hypothesis of schizophrenia and have included exposure of animals to stressful stimulation. Other animal models have involved prenatal exposure to maternal immune activation or drugs that disrupt neuronal development, followed by stress during adolescence or in early adulthood to unmask vulnerabilities. Neonatal hippocampal lesions have been employed in other animal models of schizophrenia. Another profitable approach has been to selectively breed laboratory mice or rats for their susceptibility to dopaminergic drugs. A more recent approach has been to develop laboratory mice with targeted alterations in risk genes for schizophrenia that were previously identified in clinical studies. In many cases, the effects of these risk genes are unmasked by exposure of animals to stressful stimulation during specific stages of postnatal development.",

      "abstract": "The concept of depression encompasses a series of psychopathological disorders that differ in regard to symptomatology, severity, course and prognosis. It is important to individualize these disorders for a better understanding of the following studies and of their diagnostic management. Major depressive disorder, as defined by CID X 1 and DSM IV , may have different clinical characteristics (table I). A specifier that may be employed in diagnosing the major depressive episode is the presence of melancholic symptoms (melancholia), whose main characteristic is the loss of interest and pleasure in all or almost all activities and a lack of reactivity to usually pleasant stimuli. In these circumstances, the depressive mood does not improve, not even temporarily, when something positive happens. Yet, at least three of the following symptoms should be present for the diagnosis of major depression to be made: depressive mood qualitatively different from the normal, worsening in the morning, terminal insomnia (to wake up at least two hours before the usual time), psychomotor retardation or agitation, anorexia or significant weight loss (5% of the body weight per month), excessive or inappropriate guilt. Sometimes, however, the depressive disorder is atypical with mood reactivity, i.e., enhancement of the mood in response to real or potential positive events, significant weight gain, increase in appetite, hypersomnia, sensation of heaviness in the upper and lower limbs, in addition to a prolonged pattern of sensitivity to interpersonal rejection resulting in significant social or occupational impairment . The dysthymic disorder (dysthymia) is characterized by a chronically depressed mood lasting for most of the day, for the majority of days, and lasting for at least two years . The individual may note significant reduction in usual interests and in self-criticism, frequently seeing himself or herself as uninteresting and incapable. As these symptoms become part of daily life, usually they are not mentioned by the patient unless directly inquired about by Andre Luiz Langer Manica, Carolina Garcia Soares Leaes, Benicio Noronha Frey, Mario Francisco Juruena",

Objectives Claiming the concept of paraphrenia as a clinical entity with its own phenomenological characteristics included in chronic psychotic disorders. Aims To keep in mind classic psychopathology, not included in current code list, such as ICD and DSM. Methods A 40-year-old woman with good premorbid adaptation, no previous history of mental disorder. Her first psychotic symptoms appeared at 30, not because drug effect. Father diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia. Among her first internment, her mood was persistently elevated, expansive and easily irritable. She had bizarre megalomaniac delusions of grandeur, which combined with erotomanic ideas felt as ego-syntonic, supported by auditive hallucinations. There were no other symptoms found in manic episodes in previous historical of affective descompensations. Results Antipsychotics only had effect in mood, which turned euthymic. Active psychoticism has continually been present for 10 years although different treatment. No major affective descompensations has taken place among this period.

      "title": "Secondary headache in emergency",
      "abstract": "Headache is one of the most common causes of access to Emergency Departments (ED). Primary headaches and headaches secondary to benign conditions (e.g headache attributed to acute sinusitis) represent the majority of cases, while secondary life-threatening headaches are less frequent. The primary objective in the ED setting is to decide whether the headache is primary or secondary and recognize serious life-threatening conditions presenting with headache and requiring prompt medical diagnosis and care, such as subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), intracerebral hemorrhage, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), cervical artery dissection (CAD), brain tumors, pituitary apoplexy, spontaneous intracranial hypotension, or intracranial infections. Careful history taking and physical examination remain the most important part of the assessment of the headache patient[1]. A thorough history should investigate the onset of headache, quality, location and irradiation of pain, associated symptoms experienced before and during the headache, concomitant medical conditions, medication use, recent trauma or interventions. The examination should then target areas identified as abnormal during the headache history; funduscopy evaluation should be performed when symptoms may suggest an increased intracranial pressure; in addition, a complete neurological assessment including level of consciousness, cranial nerve testing, pupillary responses, motor strength and sensorial testing, and signs of meningeal irritation is essential[2]. Based on historical and physical findings “red flags” for secondary headache disorders are sudden onset, onset after 50 years of age, increased frequency, severity or significant change in the usual headache pattern, new onset with an underlying medical condition (such as cancer or immunodepression), concomitant signs of systemic illness (such as fever, neck stiffness, rash), focal neurologic signs or symptoms, papilledema, and head trauma[2]. In headache patients with one or more “red flags” a diagnostic workup is indicated including blood tests, neuroimaging studies, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examinations, which are selected depending on the patient's history and findings. Blood testing and dosage of inflammation indexes (erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein) should be performed in all headache patients especially when an infective or inflammatory condition is suspected. In the ED, non-contrast computed tomography (CT) is the preferred imaging study and is used to rule out hemorrhage, while most patients should perform a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scan followed by CT/MRI angiography if brain vessel disease is suspected (such as, CAD, aneurysms, and CVST). Lumbar puncture with CSF analysis may help to diagnose SAH, infection, tumor and disorders related to CSF hypertension or hypotension[3, 4]. Treatment and prognosis depend on the etiology of the headache. Prompt recognition and early treatment of secondary headache are essential to avoid some preventable complications.",

      "title": "Psychogenic Nonepileptic Seizures",
      "abstract": "Pseudoseizure is an older term for events that appear to be epileptic seizures but, in fact, do not represent the manifestation of abnormal excessive synchronous cortical activity, which defines epileptic seizures. They are not a variation of epilepsy but are of psychiatric origin. Other terms used in the past include hysterical seizures, psychogenic seizures, and others. The most standard current terminology is psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES). Some advocate other terms such as psychogenic functional spells or psychogenic nonepileptic events, spells, or attacks. These terms reinforce the idea that the events are not epileptic seizures. A retrospective review of a small number of patients over a number of years revealed that dozens of different diagnostic terms were used to describe these events. Though established in use, the term pseudoseizure and others should be regarded as jargon, and the use of psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (or alternatively, spells) (PNES) is encouraged for clarity. Distinguishing PNES from epileptic seizures may be difficult at the bedside even to experienced observers. In theory, almost any recurrent behavior may represent epileptic seizures. The evolution of epilepsy monitoring units and the ability to utilize simultaneous video and EEG recordings may be a key to diagnosis. Video electroencephalography (video-EEG) of a typical event showing the absence of epileptiform activity during the spell with a compatible history is regarded as the gold standard for diagnosis. Diagnostic delay of years with psychogenic nonepileptic seizures is common. Treatment of PNES may be difficult, but it is clear that anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) are of no benefit. In addition to unnecessary costs and the potential side effects of AEDs for these patients, life-threatening side effects such as respiratory depression may occur if psychogenic nonepileptic status epilepticus is treated with large dosages of benzodiazepines.",

A 12-year-old boy was diagnosed with Wilson's disease on the basis of the physical examination findings and low ceruloplasmin levels (8.1 mg/dl). After 2 weeks of being diagnosed with Wilson's disease, he developed an acute onset illness, characterized by delusion of persecution, fearfulness, hypervigilence and decreased sleep. These symptoms were not associated with any confusion, clouding of consciousness, hallucinations and affective symptoms. There was no past or family history of psychosis. One week after the onset of the symptoms he was prescribed tab penicillamine, initially 250 mg/day, which was increased to 500 mg/day after 3 days. After increase in the dose of penicillamine, his psychiatric symptoms worsened and led to hospitalization. A diagnosis of organic delusional disorder (F06.2) due to Wilson's disease was considered. Tab risperidone 1 mg/day was started, and the dose of penicillamine was reduced with which symptoms resolved. Whenever a young adolescent develops psychosis, especially of delusional type, the possibility of Wilson's disease must be considered.",

      "title": "Psychedelics and mental health: reimagining care through science, insight, and compassion",
      "abstract": "Introduction In recent years, psychiatry has witnessed a renaissance in the investigation of psychedelic compounds, a broad class of psychoactive substances that induce altered states of consciousness, often characterized by changes in perception, mood, and cognition, which were largely shelved following regulatory crackdowns in the 1970s. The renewed interest is driven by a mounting crisis in mental health treatment efficacy, particularly for conditions labelled as treatment-resistant. As research continues to underscore the limitations of conventional monoaminergic antidepressants, there is a growing openness to alternative paradigms that were previously considered fringe (Wang and Wang 2025). These substances can be categorized into Classic psychedelics (Serotonergic hallucinogens, such as LSD -Lysergic acid diethylamide, psilocybin, and mescaline), Entactogens, such as MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine), and Dissociative psychedelics such as ketamine and phencyclidine (PCP).Psychedelics are being revisited not merely as pharmacological agents but as facilitators of profound psychological and existential experiences with therapeutic implications. This opinion article explores the current state of evidence, discusses the mechanisms by which psychedelics may exert their effects, and advocates for a balanced, evidence-based integration of these compounds into modern psychiatric care. Therapeutic Potential and Current Evidence Among the most compelling findings is the rapid and enduring antidepressant effect of psychedelics, often after just one or two sessions, especially when combined with psychotherapy, but it is also unclear how much of the effect has to do with the therapy. Increasingly, studies are being conducted with minimal or no therapy (Li and Wang 2025). Psilocybin has demonstrated significant efficacy in reducing depressive symptoms in several randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Carhart-Harris et al. (2021) reported that in this 6-week randomized study comparing psilocybin and escitalopram for individuals with persistent mild-to-severe depression, there was no significant difference between the two groups in the primary outcome — the change in QIDS-SR-16 depression scores at week 6. Although secondary outcomes tended to favour psilocybin, the results should be interpreted with caution, as the confidence intervals were not corrected for multiple comparisons, making firm conclusions unreliable. Both groups showed lower depression scores at week 6 compared to baseline, but the lack of a placebo group makes it difficult to determine how much of the improvement was due to the treatment itself. Here, and as in the case of MDMA trials below, we acknowledge the need for an 'active placebo' use with low-dose psychedelics, in order to avoid unsuccessful blinding (Butler at al., 2022, Wen et al., 2024).Similarly, MDMA-assisted psychotherapy has shown impressive results in the treatment of PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder). Unlike classic psychedelics such as psilocybin or LSD, which act primarily as 5-HT2A (5-hydroxytryptamine 2A) receptor agonists, MDMA operates through a different mechanism. It increases synaptic levels of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, and promotes the release of oxytocin, which may underpin its empathogenic and prosocial effects. The Phase 3 trial by Mitchell et al. (2021) demonstrated that MDMA significantly reduced PTSD symptoms and functional impairment compared to placebo, with a large effect size and favourable safety profile and yet, this was declined by the FDA in the summer of 2024. The juxtaposition between the FDA's \"Breakthrough Therapy\" designation and its subsequent rejection of MDMA-assisted therapy by Lykos Therapeutics in 2024 may seem contradictory. However, \"Breakthrough\" status only reflects preliminary evidence of clinical benefit and the potential for expedited review—it does not guarantee approval. In the case of Lykos, reviewers raised concerns about study methodology, functional unblinding, and safety monitoring. These critiques suggest that psychedelic therapy must meet not only efficacy thresholds but also stringent expectations for rigor, transparency, and real-world feasibility. This tension highlights the evolving regulatory landscape and the need for further multisite trials that balance scientific enthusiasm with methodological conservatism. Mechanisms of Action: Beyond Monoamines Psychedelics primarily exert their effects through agonism at the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor, leading to a cascade of neurobiological changes. These include increased synaptogenesis, neuroplasticity, and altered connectivity between key brain networks such as the default mode network (DMN), salience network, and executive control network (Vollenweider & Preller, 2020). The transient disintegration of the DMN, often associated with the ego-dissolution experience, appears to facilitate a cognitive reset, allowing patients to revisit entrenched thought patterns with a renewed perspective. This mirrors findings in ketamine research, where rapid antidepressant effects are also linked to neuroplasticity and the reconsolidation of emotional memory (Mikellides et al., 2022). Moreover, psychedelics enable emotional catharsis, insight, and existential re-evaluation, phenomena that are often absent in pharmacotherapy based on chemical symptom suppression. Mikellides et al. (2024) describe the experience as a form of psychological catharsis—a profound emotional release. While some practitioners draw parallels between catharsis and non-ordinary states of consciousness, it is important to distinguish this from a true spiritual emergency. As defined by Grof & Grof, spiritual emergency is more akin to a transient psychotic-like experience marked by identity disruption and disorientation, not merely emotional release (Grof & Grof, 1989; Lukoff et al., 1998). Conflating the two may inadvertently suggest that destabilization is necessary for healing, a notion that carries clinical and ethical risks. Clinical Integration and Challenges Preliminary evidence suggests that the therapeutic context—including set, setting, and therapist support— may influence outcomes with psychedelics. The 'set' refers to the patient's mindset, expectations, intentions, and mental state going into the session; the 'setting' involves the physical and social environment in which the psychedelic is administered. (Gorman et al., 2021, Ko and Lewis 2022). However, the specific contribution of these factors remains unclear in the absence of controlled studies directly comparing drug administration with and without such support. These substances are not stand-alone medications; rather, they function as adjuncts to intensive psychotherapeutic processes. Training therapists and establishing ethical, evidence-based protocols is essential. Additionally, psychedelic treatments remain inaccessible for many due to cost, regulatory hurdles, and stigma and a big portion of the cost is likely to be the labor required to do the therapy (Marseille et al. 2022). These authors demonstrated that MDMA-assisted therapy is not only clinically beneficial but also cost-effective for PTSD treatment. Despite high up-front costs, the intervention yielded substantial long-term savings and health improvements, especially when delivered with a third session.In their 2022 study, Marseille et al. evaluated the cost-effectiveness of MDMA-assisted therapy (MDMA-AT) for treating severe or extreme chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in the United States. Utilizing data from a Phase 3 clinical trial, the researchers employed a Markov model to compare MDMA-AT with standard care over a 30-year horizon. The analysis revealed that MDMA-AT, costing $11,537 per patient, could lead to discounted net healthcare savings of $132.9 million per 1,000 patients, accrue 4,856 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and avert 61.4 premature deaths. The therapy was projected to break even on costs within 3.8 years, delivering 887 QALYs by that time. Notably, the inclusion of a third MDMA In review session enhanced both medical savings and health benefits compared to a two-session regimen. Even under conservative assumptions—such as no healthcare cost savings—MDMA-AT maintained an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $2,384 per QALY gained, well below commonly accepted thresholds. These findings suggest that MDMA-AT offers substantial clinical benefits and is cost-saving from a payer's perspective for patients with severe PTSD. However, the authors acknowledge that further research is needed to confirm these results and address potential limitations. Current clinical trials are often conducted in highly controlled academic environments, which may limit generalizability. However, naturalistic studies, such as those involving ketamine (Mikellides et al., 2022), provide encouraging evidence of real-world effectiveness in community settings. Comparison with Ketamine and Other Non-Conventional Treatments Ketamine's entry into psychiatric practice has paved the way for psychedelics. As a dissociative anaesthetic with glutamatergic activity, ketamine produces rapid antidepressant effects in patients with Treatment-Resistant Depression (TRD). It has established a precedent for rethinking what constitutes an effective intervention and challenged the dominance of the monoamine hypothesis (Mikellides et al., 2023). The comparison of ketamine with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in TRD, as explored by Mikellides et al. (2022), highlight that non-traditional therapies can be both effective and safe. Psychedelics are the next logical step in this evolution, offering the potential for deep psychological transformation. who highlight that non-traditional therapies, such as ketamine-assisted psychotherapy, demonstrate both safety and efficacy in treatment-resistant populations. Ketamine induces altered states of consciousness that have shown transformative psychological effects in some patients. Building on this, the field is now exploring classic psychedelics like psilocybin and LSD, which may offer even deeper transpersonal experiences and long-lasting therapeutic benefits.Combination Therapy: Psychedelics and rTMS Emerging anecdotal and clinical evidence (Dębowska et al., 2023) suggests that combining psychedelics with neuromodulatory interventions like rTMS may yield synergistic effects. rTMS, a non-invasive brain stimulation method targeting specific cortical regions, is known to modulate neural circuitry and improve symptoms of depression, OCD (Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder), and PTSD. In clinical settings in Cyprus rTMS Centres has been used for over 6 years, with growing interest in integrating it with psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy. The hypothesis is that rTMS may enhance neuroplasticity. This integrative model represents a frontier in personalized psychiatry and warrants formal study. The combined use of ketamine and rTMS (with the Mikellides Protocol) has promising clinical potential, as demonstrated by us (Saabneh et al. 2025, in Press).Psychedelics and Existential Distress in End-of-Life Care Beyond depression and PTSD, psychedelics have shown promise in alleviating existential distress in terminally ill patients. Grob et al. (2011) and Griffiths et al. (2016) found that psilocybin significantly reduced anxiety and depression in patients with life-threatening cancer diagnoses. Participants described enhanced meaning, acceptance of mortality, and spiritual well-being following psychedelic-assisted therapy. Comparative Safety and Misconceptions Public and professional scepticism about psychedelics often centres on safety concerns. However, accumulating evidence suggests that, within controlled environments, psychedelics in review are physiologically safe and non-addictive (Zhang et al., 2025, Kumar et al., 2025).Gasser et al. (2022) found that classic psychedelics have an exceptionally low toxicity profile and negligible risk of dependence. Adverse events are rare and usually relate to unsupervised use or underlying psychotic vulnerability. Proper screening, preparation, and integration mitigate these risks. In fact, some experts argue that the relative safety of psychedelics compares favourably with commonly prescribed psychiatric medications..Neuroethical Reflections and the Question of Identity One of the most intellectually provocative aspects of psychedelic therapy is its impact on identity, belief systems, and metaphysical assumptions. Reports of ego dissolution, mystical experiences, and spiritual insight raise questions about neuroethics and informed consent (Letheby 2021). While many patients find these experiences beneficial, some may find them disorienting or even distressing (Yaden and Griffiths 2021). Historical and even recent abuses such as the CIA's MK-ULTRA program, underscore the potential for misuse of psychedelics. Recent public concerns involving high-profile figures highlight ongoing risks of worldview manipulation. The Role of Psychotherapy in Psychedelic-Assisted Treatment The integration of psychotherapy with psychedelic administration has been central to most clinical trials to date. Although many protocols include structured therapeutic support before, during, and after psychedelic sessions, there is a lack of rigorous randomized trials directly comparing drug-alone versus drug-plus-therapy conditions. This limitation makes it difficult to determine whether psychotherapy is essential or simply supportive. A recent commentary underscores this uncertainty. Zamaria et al. (2025) argue that while therapy is widely used alongside psychedelics, its specific therapeutic contribution has not been empirically delineated. Goodwin et al. (2023) similarly question whether the benefits observed in psilocybin trials are due to the drug itself or to the psychotherapeutic framework in which it is delivered. Naturalistic studies of ketamine treatment provide useful insights. For example, Dore et al. (2019) reported significant clinical improvements in patients receiving ketamine-assisted psychotherapy, yet noted that similar outcomes have been observed in patients receiving ketamine infusions without formal therapy. Additionally, Joneborg et al. (2022) highlighted transient neural changes associated with ketamine treatments, suggesting that pharmacological effects alone may drive significant portions of the therapeutic response. Toward a New Therapeutic Paradigm The resurgence of psychedelic psychiatry suggests a turning point in the field. These substances urge us to reconsider the role of consciousness, meaning, and personal narrative in healing. In contrast to the reductionist view of mental illness as mere chemical imbalance, psychedelics promote a reintegrative model where subjective experience, relationship, and insight are central. Such a shift aligns with broader calls in the psychiatric community to rehumanize care. It echoes the principles of compassionate, trauma-informed, and relational psychiatry, where healing arises not solely from neurochemical modulation but through connection, presence, and personal transformation (Mikellides et al., 2023). The Path Forward: Recommendations To responsibly harness the benefits of psychedelics, we recommend the following: 1. Expand Research: Larger, multisite, placebo-controlled trials are needed to refine protocols and determine long-term efficacy and safety. However, it needs to be clarified that in psychedelic research it may be best to use low-dose psychedelics as an active placebo.2. Therapist Training: Establish more widely accessible accredited training pathways for psychedelic-assisted therapists such as MAPS (The Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies) emphasizing ethics, trauma sensitivity, and integration skills. 3. Policy Reform: Advocate for policies that support compassionate access while upholding rigorous medical standards. 4. Public Education: Combat stigma through evidence-based dialogue that frames psychedelics as tools of healing, not recreation. 5. International Collaboration: Learn from global traditions and practices, especially indigenous cultures that have long employed these compounds for healing. Conclusion Psychedelics are re-entering psychiatry not as recreational relics of the 1960s but as scientifically credible, clinically relevant treatments for some of the most challenging conditions in mental health. Their potential to accelerate healing, enhance insight, and restore meaning makes them uniquely suited to address the deep suffering that characterizes treatment-resistant disorders. As with any powerful intervention, psychedelics demand caution, respect, and a framework of ethical use. But if integrated wisely, they may help usher in a new era of psychiatry—one that prioritizes not only symptom remission but personal transformation, relational depth, and spiritual well-being. The path forward is not merely about approving new molecules. It is about redefining what it means to heal.",

      "title": "Psychedelic Therapy: A Primer for Primary Care Clinicians – Part I. Historical Perspective and Overview",
      "abstract": "Background: Psychedelic drugs have recently emerged as plausibly effective pharmacological agents for the management of depression, anxiety, and other neuropsychiatric conditions, including conditions that have not benefited from prior interventions. The latter half of the twentieth century marked a revolution in the treatment of depression, anxiety, and psychosis, exemplified by the introduction of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, dopamine antagonists, and other pharmacological agents. Nevertheless, mental illness remains a major public health crisis, affecting nearly one billion individuals worldwide. Areas of Uncertainty: Due to the recency of the resurgence in psychedelic research, there are still only a small number of large, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials of psychedelics in psychiatric populations. While initial clinical trials of psychedelics for depression were very promising, trials of psilocybin with larger sample sizes (100+ participants) seem to suggest that it may not be more effective than antidepressants.Therapeutic Advances: Esketamine, a dissociative hallucinogen drug, was approved for the management of major depressive disorder by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2019. As of December 2023, two Phase III trials of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), a synthetic drug that inhibits the serotonin transporter, have been completed; the results indicate that MDMA is superior to existing pharmacological treatments for post-traumatic stress disorder. A phase III trial of psilocybin, a naturally occurring serotonin receptor partial agonist, is currently underway. The following series details the current state of research in psychedelic therapeutics, including lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), N-N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and ayahuasca, psilocybin, ibogaine, MDMA, and ketamine. Conclusions: Psychedelic drugs and structural derivatives offer a great deal of promise for the management of a wide range of psychiatric morbidities. It is imperative that clinicians become familiar with these novel agents and learn how to implement psychedelic therapeutics as part of a patient-centered care paradigm.",

      "title": "Treatment options for residual insomnia in schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "It is well documented that patients with schizophrenia demonstrate disturbances in sleep continuity and sleep architecture as well as disrupted circadian rhythmicity. These sleep disturbances are associated with reduced quality of life and social functioning. Insomnia might be secondary to the hyperarousal caused by positive psychotic symptoms. However, in recent years, it has been acknowledged that insomnia often persists beyond adequately dosed antipsychotic treatment. Residual insomnia in schizophrenia, defined as insomnia persisting beyond otherwise adequate antipsychotic treatment, covers a range of insomnia symptoms that could be secondary to other potentially treatable conditions such as medical or psychiatric comorbidity, substance use, use of medication that might interfere with sleep or a primary sleep disorder. A thorough evaluation of the insomnia diagnosis is therefore warranted. This includes a careful patient history and examination that addresses sleep and wake function, as well as common medical, psychiatric and medication-/substance-related conditions. The complex problem of residual insomnia in schizophrenia is currently addressed by substituting or adding sedating drugs, but current treatment guidelines suffer from a lack of information on the best clinical practice. Substituting an otherwise efficient antipsychotic drug-therapy with a more sedating drug carries the risk of psychotic relapse during the switch, and adding another drug carries the disadvantages of polypharmacy including increased rate of side-effects, drug–drug interactions, patient non-compliance and medication errors. To investigate the evidence base for the different treatment options in residual insomnia in schizophrenia, we performed a systematic literature review. We searched the major bibliographic databases for randomized clinical trials (search terms: sleep and schizophren*) supplemented by review of reference lists of relevant articles. We found only five randomized clinical trials investigating pharmacological treatment options for residual insomnia in schizophrenia. Two trials examined the efficacy of switching antipsychotic drug to, respectively, risperidone 1 or its active metabolite, paliperidone 2. The data suggest that risperidone might be a good choice for this particular indication, but methodological limitations and the lack of comparison with other second-generation antipsychotics weaken the suggestion. Three studies evaluating the efficacy of melatonin showed improvement in certain sleep characteristics (e.g. sleep duration and sleep efficiency) 3-5, but two of the studies 3, 4 came from the same group of researchers presumably using the same sample of patients. We found no published randomized clinical trials investigating non-pharmacological treatment of residual insomnia in schizophrenia. Thus, our attempt to review this clinically important subject was limited by the few interventions tested experimentally and difficulties making a thorough comparison of the tested interventions due to methodological limitations. These included small sample size, selective reporting, lack of specification of primary outcome measure and a high level of variability regarding assessment tools and allowed comedication. The benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine-like drugs (Z-drugs) are frequently prescribed as hypnotics, but they have not been investigated for residual insomnia in schizophrenia. These drugs are generally only recommended for short-term therapy due to the development of tolerance and dependence. Because residual insomnia in schizophrenia is a chronic condition, these drugs are generally not recommendable. An additional reason to avoid prescription of benzodiazepines is their deteriorating effect on cognitive function and their impairment (rather than correction) of sleep architecture. Particular care should be taken in patients' comorbid for a sleep-related breathing disorder or a comorbid history of alcohol or drug abuse. Other possible treatment options mentioned in the literature, but not systematically investigated in schizophrenia, include add-on treatment with drugs with antihistamine properties including various antidepressants, antipsychotics and antihistamines. They are extensively prescribed (or sold over-the-counter for some antihistamines), but scarce evidence exists regarding efficacy, tolerability and safety when used off-label as hypnotics. The use of classic antihistamines (e.g. diphenhydramine) is limited by anticholinergic (including cognitive impairment) and cardiovascular adverse effects. Some evidence suggests the use of low-dose doxepin and trazodone (tricyclic antidepressants) as efficacious hypnotic drugs in primary insomnia and not associated with tolerance, weight gain or abuse potential. However, they have only been sparsely investigated in insomnia not associated with depression and are not available in all countries. The addition of a low-dose quetiapine as hypnotic agent has gained widespread acceptance without any evidence base of randomized controlled trials to support its use. Observational studies have found that even the low doses are associated with the development of adverse metabolic effects. In conclusion, the evidence base is currently too scarce to extract any valid clinical recommendations regarding the treatment of residual insomnia in schizophrenia. Future studies should focus on rigorous evaluation of the switching and augmenting strategies currently applied in clinical practice and also on evaluation of psychological behavioural treatment methods. The latter is especially important in this vulnerable population of patients already chronically medicated. The authors report no financial or other relationship relevant to the subject of this article.",

      "abstract": "Neuromuscular diseases raise a lot of anesthesia related problems. The first is the hitherto unknown disease discovered by an unexpected adverse reaction to anesthetics or/and muscle relaxants up to a life-threatening incident. A second problem is the probable, suspected or proven disposition to malignant hyperthermia in patients with other neuromuscular diseases. Furthermore, severe rhabdomyolysis can be induced in myopathic muscle by the application of succinylcholine alone or in combination with inhalational anesthetics resulting in hyperkalemia, myoglobinuria and CK-elevation, sometimes followed by cardiac arrest. Cardiomyopathy is a common feature in many neuromuscular diseases. All cardiodepressant agents must be avoided. Specific problems with muscle relaxants arise in myasthenia gravis and in the myotonias. In the later stages of severe neuromuscular diseases the main problem concerning anesthesia is respiratory failure. The individual risk of every patient has to be evaluated before anesthesia. Recommendations for the anesthetic management are given.",

      "abstract": "Harmine, Win-2299, and Nalline in single dosage produce many new mental effects in schizophrenics grossly similar to those elicited by mescaline and LSD. Many of the same effects are reported in normals after harmine and Nalline (other workers). unlike mescaline and LSD at usual dosage levels, the present psychotomimetics regularly produce drowsiness and sleep along with the aberrant mental effects. The resultant state is partly that of \"hypnagogic\" visual hallucinations or imagery. The results with increased dosage suggest that the basic effect of these agents is to produce an acute toxic reaction type. The difference between them and mescaline or LSD with respect to clouding of consciousness and certain aspects of the hallucinogenic response may be quantitative rather than qualitative. The indole nucleus is not necessary in the structure of psychotomimetics since Win-2299 and Nalline are non-indoles. The tertiary nitrogen grouping may contribute to certain aspects of psychotomimetic action.",

      "title": "Seizure-like States",
      "abstract": "Seizure-like episodes resemble seizures, but are not true seizures. Breath-holding spells (BHS), tics, syncope, gastroesophageal reflux (GER), and sleep disturbances all may be mistaken for seizures, but important distinguishing features can help the clinician differentiate these entities from a true seizure.Like seizures, seizure-like states are paroxysmal events that have a discrete onset, ending, and return to baseline. The duration, frequency, and clinical characteristics are different for each entity and help the clinician distinguish among them, usually on the basis of history and physical examination, sometimes with the aid of additional diagnostic testing.Seizures are disturbances of the central nervous system characterized by phenomena that the patient cannot control, with or without a concurrent loss of consciousness. There may be major motor manifestations. The range of clinical seizures extends from subtle behavioral arrests (absence seizures) to the more obvious generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Generally, consciousness is lost, and the postictal period of drowsiness or decreased responsiveness following the episode often lasts 21/2 times the length of the actual paroxysm. If the paroxysm is momentary, a postictal period may not be identifiable.BHS are common, peaking in children between 2 and 3 years of age, although even infants may have them. Commonly, those who hold their breath outgrow their spells by 5 or 6 years of age. BHS are characterized by the child’s apparent inability to breathe, accompanied by a change in color, limpness, and collapse, followed briefly by a return to baseline. The duration usually is less than 1 minute. Generalized tonic movements from brief cerebral ischemia may accompany BHS, but do not imply any increased risk of epilepsy in the future. Clinically, BHS can be categorized as pallid or cyanotic. The parents often describe the child as becoming frustrated and crying prior to cyanotic episodes and having suffered minor trauma, sometimes without crying, prior to pallid episodes. The frequency varies, but usually the spells occur a few times in a month. Treatment often is behavioral modification of the parents’ response to such episodes; rarely, atropine-like agents or cardiac pacing may be necessary. Paroxysmal episodes usually are distinguished from seizures by the typical history, although epilepsy monitoring occasionally is used to verify the nonepileptic nature of the events.Syncope, which like many seizures, involves loss of consciousness, can occur with or without a warning. Children may describe a premonitory sensation, with their vision becoming gray or like the “snow” of static on a black and white television. Depending on the severity of the syncopal episode, the child may return to consciousness immediately or after a brief period of time. With longer periods of unconsciousness, abnormal clonic or tonic movements may be seen, making it more difficult to distinguish the episode from a seizure. Most syncopal episodes are either neurogenic or cardiogenic in origin. Neurogenic syncope occurs when activation of the autonomic nervous system causes reflex slowing of the heart, with sinus bradycardia and blood pressure changes. Common triggers of neurogenic syncope include micturition, coughing, swallowing, and vasovagal phenomena. The most common cause of cardiogenic syncope is a conduction defect, resulting in dysrhythmia or arrest. Usually a cardiogenic event occurs suddenly, without any warning. Exercise is one known precipitator of cardiogenic syncope.The duration of syncopal events usually is brief, with prolonged confusion being more likely after a cardiogenic episode. Evaluation includes a physical examination, with measurement of orthostatic blood pressures and 12-lead electrocardiography. The extent of further cardiac evaluation depends on the clinical history; the history most often distinguishes between a seizure and a syncopal event. Electroencephalography (EEG) rarely is revealing in these scenarios.Tics are episodes characterized by repetitive, stereotyped movements involving one or more muscle groups. Simple tics, which occur in as many as 20% of children, most commonly involve muscles of the face and neck, manifesting as eye blinking, facial twitching, shrugging, head turning, sniffing, grunting, or repetitive clearing of the throat. Tics often subside within weeks to months, although they can recur. Children described as having complex tics either have multiple types of tics or tics involving several muscle groups. If complex tics are associated with vocal tics, the child likely has Tourette syndrome, which has an autosomal dominant inheritance with variable penetrance and expression. Any child old enough to understand the question can be asked if he or she can “make them go away.” Both simple and complex tics can be suppressed by the child and often are “released” in a more relaxed, appropriate environment. The episodes, frequently precipitated by stress or excitement, typically are brief, but their frequency varies from several per minute to fairly rarely.Treatment of tics and Tourette syndrome depends on the degree to which the episodes interfere with normal functioning. Clonidine, haloperidol, or risperidone in small doses can reduce episodes, although they rarely abolish tics. Family support and education are crucial in the management of affected children. In most cases, tics and Tourette syndrome can be distinguished from seizures by the history. Usually, the level of consciousness is not altered, and when mild, the movements upset parents more than the child, who typically is oblivious to them unless they cause teasing by peers.GER can manifest, particularly in infants, with paroxysmal episodes that are difficult to distinguish from seizures. At their most severe, such episodes present as apparent life-threatening events, characterized by apnea, color change, and limpness or arching of the back. The paroxysmal episodes frequently are related temporally to feedings and spitting up or vomiting. When severe, the spells can occur with every feeding. The duration usually is brief, and the child returns to baseline. The physical findings are normal, although if the reflux is severe, there may be poor weight gain or other signs of nutritional problems. Seizures can be distinguished from these episodes by history. Thickening feeds, acid-suppressing therapy, and promotility drugs are used when treatment is necessary.Certain sleep disturbances in children can mimic seizures: benign neonatal myoclonus, rhythmic parasomnias, night terrors, and sleepwalking. These paroxysms involve either abnormal movements or abnormal behaviors during sleep. The spells mimic seizures because the level of consciousness is altered or behavior becomes abnormal, with or without abnormal involuntary movements. Benign sleep myoclonus occurs in infancy, beginning either in the first postnatal weeks and being outgrown by 3 to 4 months of age or beginning later in infancy and being outgrown around 2 years of age. Myoclonic jerking of various muscle groups occurs every few seconds during nonrapid eye movement sleep, usually lasting fewer than 3 minutes, but occasionally persisting as long as 30 minutes. If such movements are repetitive in the same muscle groups or are synchronous and repetitive on both sides of the body, they are more likely to be seizures. Rhythmic parasomnias can manifest as repetitive episodes of rhythmic movements of the neck and trunk or legs or may present as body rocking or head banging. There is no associated emotional disturbance. The episodes occur in early (stage 2) sleep. Night terrors typically are described as the child suddenly sitting up and screaming, seeming to be terrified while remaining unresponsive. The duration usually is about 10 minutes, after which the child returns to sleep. The frequency is variable. If awakened, the child is unaware of the event, which occurs in the first 3 hours of sleep during stage 3 or 4 (deep) sleep. There is a familial predisposition.With sleepwalking, a child gets up and walks around in a trance, with eyes open and possibly mumbling incoherently, and then returns to bed. The child can be put back to bed but may become agitated if restrained. On awakening, the child does not recall the event. Sleepwalking occurs in the first 3 hours after sleep onset; typically, episodes begin between 5 and 10 years of age and can persist into adulthood. The duration of an event varies, as does the frequency. Such sleep disturbances most often can be distinguished from seizures by history. Occasionally, epilepsy monitoring may be needed to clarify the diagnosis. None of these entities is associated with EEG changes. If treatment is required, small doses of clonazepam may be used.The recording by the parent (with a camcorder) of any unusual spell can provide valuable information to the clinician attempting to diagnose these puzzling occurrences.Seizures are paroxysmal episodes that need to be distinguished from other events that may mimic them, including BHS, syncope, tics, GER, and sleep disturbances. A clinical history defining the specific characteristics of the event, including duration and frequency, and sometimes a videotape, in conjunction with the physical examination often yield an accurate diagnosis, allowing for appropriate intervention. In rare cases, EEG and epilepsy monitoring can be used to help distinguish among these entities.Comment: Asked once why he robbed banks, Willie Sutton supposedly replied, “That’s where the money is.” Not everything that looks like a seizure is what it appears to be. Telling the difference depends, more than anything else, first on asking the right questions. More than scans and even EEGs, the history is the bank.",

      "title": "Treating insomnia with medications",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is a conspicuous problem in modern 24 h society. In this brief overview, medications used to treat insomnia such as hypnotics, sedatives, medications inducing sedation as a side effect, medications directed at the sleep-associated circadian neuroendocrine system, and agents utilized in treating insomnia-inducing sleep diagnoses such as restless leg syndrome are discussed. The newer GABA-effective hypnotics are the only medications with demonstrated effectiveness in treating chronic insomnia with the majority of evidence supporting treatment efficacy for cognitive-behavioral therapy and short acting GABA-receptor agonists. In patients with comorbid insomnia the use of hypnotics can improve outcomes and potentially reduce morbidity and mortality associated with the use of more toxic medications. Except in individuals whose insomnia is secondary to circadian disturbance, mood disorder/depression and/or restless leg syndrome , there is minimal evidence supporting the efficacy of other medications used to treat insomnia despite their widespread use. Sedatives and other medications used off-label for sedative side-effects are a contributing factor to drug induced hypersomnolence, a factor in more than 30% of motor accident deaths. Hypnotic medications with low toxicity, addictive potential, minimal next day sleepiness, and an otherwise benign side-effect profile can be utilized safely and effectively to treat and improve function and quality of life for patients suffering from insomnia. These are the agents that should be exclusively classified as hypnotics and utilized to induce sleep when medications are required to treat the complaint of insomnia. Other pharmacological agents producing sedation (sedatives and agents used off-label for sedative side-effects) should be used cautiously for the treatment of insomnia due to the increased risk of next day sleepiness as well as for known toxicities and adverse side effects.",

Anders als die klinisch definierte Alternativpsychose geht die forcierte Normalisierung vom EEG-Befund aus. In der klinischen Praxis und in der Literatur werden die beiden Begriffe meist synonym gebraucht und beschreiben auch die gleichen Krankheitsbilder. Dies erlaubte eine zusammenfassende Auswertung der Publikationen über Alternativpsychose und forcierte Normalisierung. Meist ist eine Alternativpsychose oder eine forcierte Normalisierung Folge der Anfallsunterdrückung durch Antiepileptika. In der Zeit der älteren Antiepileptika wurde eine Alternativpsychose bzw. eine forcierte Normalisierung vor allem bei der Behandlung von Absencen mit Succinimiden beobachtet. In der Ära der neuen Antiepileptika, die mit der Einführung von Vigabatrin begann, waren vor allem Patienten mit relativ pharmakoresistenten fokalen Epilepsien betroffen. 1987 - vor 31 Jahren - wurde erstmals über eine paranoid-halluzinatorische Psychose bei Epilepsie durch die Behandlung mit Vigabatrin berichtet. Sukzessive folgten bis heute bei den meisten neuen Antiepileptika Berichte über eine Alternativpsychose bzw. eine forcierte Normalisierung. Eine umfassende Literatursuche ergab in diesem Zeitraum 66 Fälle mit detaillierten Angaben. Frauen waren mehr als doppelt so häufig betroffen wie Männer; der Grund ist nicht klar. In 4 retrospektiven Studien wurden weitere 176 alternative Ereignisse in pauschalerer Form mitgeteilt. Bei den wichtigeren neuen Antiepileptika scheint das Risiko einer Alternativpsychose oder einer forcierten Normalisierung bei Oxcarbazepin, Eslicarbazepin, Gabapentin und Pregabalin besonders gering zu sein.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Panic disorder consists of recurrent, unexpected panic attacks accompanied by persistent worry about future attacks and/or a maladaptive change in behavior related to the attacks. A panic attack is defined as an abrupt surge of intense fear or discomfort that reaches a peak within minutes that occurs in conjunction with several other associated symptoms such as palpitations, sweating, trembling, shortness of breath, and chest pain. Features of panic disorder that are more common in adolescents than in adults include less worry about additional panic attacks and decreased willingness to openly discuss their symptoms. All patients with suspected panic disorder should undergo a medical history, physical examination, and laboratory workup to exclude medical causes of panic attacks. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) including interoceptive exposures is the gold standard therapy intervention. Medications including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) can also help reduce symptoms.",

      "title": "Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Management of Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and Panic Disorder (PD)",
      "abstract": "Participants of expert group on CPG for Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD) and Panic Disorder S.C Tiwari, Nilesh Shah, I.D. Gupta, B.N. Gangadhar, Devendra Vijay Vergiya, Pratap Sharan INTRODUCTION Short description of anxiety disorders Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) Definition: One of the anxiety disorders, where the primary symptoms of anxiety are present at most days for at least several weeks at a time, and usually for several months. The symptoms should usually involve elements of: Apprehension (worries about future misfortunes, feeling \" on edge\", etc) Motor tension (restlessness, inability to relax, trembling) Autonomic over activity (light-headedness, sweating, tachycardia, tachypnea, dry mouth etc) The transient appearance of depressive symptoms, does not rule out the diagnosis of GAD as main diagnosis. The sufferer must not meet the full criteria for depressive episode, phobic disorder, panic disorder or OCD. Patients with generalised anxiety disorder have high anxiety and are worried about intrapsychic conflicts or external environmental events. They have multiple somatic symptoms of anxiety, restlessness, difficulty in concentration, irritability, fatigue, muscular tensions and difficulty in sleeping particularly early insomnia. They have vague apprehension about future events and fear of unknown. Common features observed in anxiety disorders include: Panic Disorder- Episodes of intense fear or discomfort accompanied by severe autonomic activity, palpitations, sweating, dyspnoea, chocking sensation or other somatic symptoms like chest pain, trembling, nausea, discomfort or fluttering sensation in abdomen and impending fear of death. Patient perceives it as a serious medical condition and invariably reaches to a medical emergency setup where after thorough physical evaluation he is declared normal. Phobias- Many patients with GAD suffer from irrational, unrealistic fears and acute autonomic reactions to certain specific situations or extreme fear to certan inanimate objects. They include agarophobia (fear of open spaces) fear of crowds, being out side home alone or traveling in a bus train or car. Some may have fear in closed spaces (claustrophobia) fear of heights (acrophobia) fear of opposite sex (hetero-phobia) fear of sight of blood (erythrophobia) or fear of facing certain social situations (social anxiety disorder) the common feature among all phobias being intense fear, increased autonomic activity and avoidance behavior (avoiding the fearful object or situation). Obsessive compulsive disorder- (OCD) has been seperately dealt with in details in these guidelines however the patients suffering from OCD have recurrent repetitive unwanted intrinsic thoughts (obsessions) or actions (compulsions) or both which lead to extreme distress, loss of time and impairment of functioning of the individual. The obsessious include douts, ideas of contamination, sexual thoughts or religious preoccupations or negative thoughts towards gods/goddess, the compulsions include activities like counting, checking, repeating, washing hoarding and touching objects, some have to and fro movements of body parts. Patient is aware of the irrationality of thoughts/actions but cannot control them, which produces intense anxiety and autonomic arousal with feelings of helplessness and guilt. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) - Usually it occurs after a terrifying event that involving physical or psychological traumatic event. It may also occure because of witnessing or experiencing a serious harm to other significant persons in life. Patients have terrifying recollections of the event, or nightmares. Some patients have an experience of living the event in an illusionary or imaginary situation with hallucinations, or flashback episodes. The patients suffer from intense psychological or physical distress. Many patients develop loss of interest, estrangement from others, sleep disturbances, irritability, difficulty concentrating, hypervigilance, and exaggerated startle response. This phenomenon may persist for one month or more before it is diagnosed. Natural history and course The age of onset is difficult to specify, as most of the patients have been anxious for long but report late. Nearly 1/3rd of the patients who have GAD seek psychiatric treatment. Many go to GPs, physicians, cardiologist, chest specialist for the somatic component of the disorder. Because of the high incidence of co-morbid mental disorders, the course and prognosis is difficult to predict. The occurrence of several negative life events greatly increases the likelihood that the disorder will develop. In all, a chronic condition may be life long. COMMON INGREDIENTS OF MANAGEMENT PLAN (FLOW CHART-1 AND 2)FLOW CHART 1. Management of Generalized Anxiety DisorderFLOW CHART 2. Management of Panic DisorderThe aim of management is to provide relief in psychological and somatic symptoms and minimize the impairment. This can be addressed in following ways. 1. Pharmacotherapy The drug treatment of GAD is some times required as long as 6-12 month treatment, some evidence indicate that treatment should be long term. 2. Psychotherapy Cognitive behaviour therapy Behavioural techniques Supportive Psychotherapy Insight oriented Psychotherapy Goals Psycho-education Direct explanation of the symptoms and disorder to the patient and the family. Monitoring of anxiety Cognitive restructuring: Corrects the hypothesized cognitive distortions and helps to identify and counter fear of bodily sensations. Efficacy Cognitive Behavioural Therapy has proven efficy other psychotherapies do help in ameliorating symptoms of anxiety. It addresses cognitive distortions and somatic symptoms. More effective with chronically anxious patients, may need 8-10 sessions. It has been shown that yogic techniques produced greater motivation to practice than progressive relaxation Meditation was found to be as effective as pharmacotherapy in controlling symptoms of anxiety. The overall efficacy claims are backed by very few Indian studies, but are useful. It requires considerable time and discipline from the patients. Adverse effects These are relatively benign. Some patients may develop dependence on the therapist and that needs cautious vigil. 3. Combined pharmacological and psychotherapeutic intervention Long-term outcome is better when they are used in combination. ASSESSMENT AND EVALUATION 1. Performing a diagnostic evaluation Psychiatric evaluation and physical examination is necessary. It includes history of present illness, current symptoms; past psychiatric history, general medical history and history of substance use, personal history (eg. psychological development, life events and response to those events), social, occupational and family history; review of the patient's medications; physical and mental status examination and adequate diagnostic tool and criteria. Diagnose GAD according to ICD-10 (W.H.0,1992). Anxiety should not be due to the other Axis I disorder (eg. mood disorder, psychotic disorder, social phobia, OCD, somatization disorder, hypochondriasis, PTSD) or a general medical condition (eg. hyperthyroidism) or substance use disorder (intoxication or withdrawal), (see appendix-1 for flow chart). 2. Evaluating particular symptoms Patients experience excessive anxiety but many of them experience panic attacks, which may worsen the clinical picture. The prolonged illness may cause depressive symptoms with emergence of suicidality and substance abuse. 3. Evaluating severity of functional impairment Many may continue to function in their social and occupational lives with some impairment, others may become severely incapacitated and give up their jobs and social duties. The impairment in different areas can be assessed self-administered visual analog scale. FORMULATING TREATMENTS AND CHOICE OF TREATMENT SETTINGS The aim of management is to provide relief in psychological and somatic symptoms and minimize the impairment. This can be addressed in following way. 1. Establishing and maintaining atherapeutic alliance The treatment of GAD may be long lasting hence the alliance is crucial. Understanding the life events, the extent and severity of symptoms requires confiding and lasting therapeutic relationship. Attention to the patient's worries and fears are essential for long term gains 2. Monitoringthe patient's psychiatric status The symptomatic improvement in psychological and autonomic symptoms leads to greater confidence in the treating doctor. The anxiety goes slowly with treatment and bursts of severe symptoms during the treatment need constant monitoring. 3. Pharmacotherapy The drug treatment of GAD is some times is seen as a 6-12 month treatment, some evidence indicate that treatment should be long term. a). Goals Reduce psychological and autonomic symptoms and other co morbid conditions. Improve occupational and social functioning. b). Efficacy Little Indian data to address the issue; mainly western data available. c). Adverse effects Different for different class of drugs. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), and pregabalin are recommended as first line drugs due to their favorable risk-benefit ratio, with some differentiation regarding the various anxiety disorders. The common category of pharmacological agents used in management of generialised anxiety disorders include SSRIs, SNRIs, Pregabalin, TCAs, Benzodiazepines, Antihistamines, Atypical antipsychotics, and Antioxidants. Role of vitamin A, C and E has been evaluated and recommended in adequate doses for patients suffering from GAD. Dosing Majority of patients respond to the low dose of antidepressants (with the exception of OCD). In the elderly, treatment should be started with half the recommended dose or less in order to minimize initial adverse drug events. The antidepressant dose should be increased to the highest recommended therapeutic level if the initial treatment with a low or medium dose fails. For patients who do not improve with standard treatments, a number of alternative options should be tried including augmentation with small dose of antipsychotics or adding another anxiolytic agent or addition of non-pharmacological therapy like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or Yoga, Meditation and increased physical activity as described below. 4. Non-pharmacological treatment Non pharmacological treatment found useful in treatment of anxiety disorders include supportive therapy, Exposure therapy (e.g. gradual exposure in vivo, \"flooding\") and response prevention. Psychoeducational advice, and suggesions to not to avoid feared situations are helpful in management. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy: Adequate strength of evidence is available for Individual CBT, Group CBT and Self-directed CBT. Choosing between medications and CBT is determined by a number of factors, particularly the patient's preference, treatment options at hand, adverse drug effects, onset of efficacy, comorbidity (e.g. with depression), financial considerations, time availability, accessibility of psychiatric and psychological treatment resources, and experience of the clinician. Steps of CBT shall include: Psychoeducation Self-monitoring Systemic exposure to panic inducing cues Countering anxious beliefs Exposure to fear cues Modify [mal-adaptive behaviors Relapse prevention Dealing with transference issues Resolving interpersonal and other emotional issues. Initial expectations and anticipation favoring CBT Accept that the worrying is out of control Perhaps, worrying offers some protective value. CBT will facilitate future adversities, despite the worrying. During the course of the treatment, revised understanding: The reasons for worrying and fears cannot be controlled Subjectively learn to control response to the fears and worries Learn to obviate the behaviour of worrying Worrying does not have a protective value Actually, worrying reinforces negative thinking Excesive worrying increases likely hood or more anxieties in the future CBT does not alter the method of managing source of the worries CBT helps to be better equipped to handle the future stress. Indian modules of psychotherapy Several therapists have talked about Search of Indian module of psychotherapy and it is a felt need to have such a module, which is socially and culturally relevant. Ancient Indian thought has provided very rich knowledge regarding mind and its functioning. From the Vedic period issues relating to mind, consciousness, understanding of human life, its existence and the concept of Atman have been widely studied and several explanations to improve the quality of human life are available in Vedic and Post Vedic literature. The Bhagvad Gita contains in condensed form all the philosophical and psycholoical wisdom of the Upanishads. Bhagwad Gita describes all aspects of yoga, psychology and is unique among the psychlogical and philosophical teachings for a student of psychotherapy, various aspects of psychotherapeutic techniques are described in it. In this excellent module of Psychotherapy through 18 chapters way of self knowledge, the Yoga of action (karma) knowledge of renunciation and action, the path of meditation, knowledge of the absolute and eternal, yogic vision, yoga of devotion, profound knowledge of three Gunas and the wisdom of renunciation and liberation have been described at length, which leads to personality transformation of Arjuna. In the modern psychotherapy, cognitive restructuring is the goal of psychotherapy, which has been accomplished a great deal through Bhagwad Gita. Prekshadhayan A Jain Meditational technique propounded by Acharya Mahapragya, which includes relaxation, meditation, yoga, asanas and pranayam, a comprehensive capsule of behavioural management has been tried in management of GAD. On mental level, it proves to be an applied method to train the mind to concentrate. It offers a way to treat serious anxiety disorders with or without drugs. Large trials of this technique are still awaited. At present, few scientific studies are available. 5. Providing Education To The Patient And Family This seemingly unimportant aspect is most relevant to Indian settings where awareness of psychiatric illness and its realization and need for treatment with compliance is little. Many feel dejected, angry, isolated and may have suicidal ideas. Family and the patient need to be told that this is like any other illness that needs treatment and success depends on compliance. 6. Addressing early signs of relapse The education that the illness is a chronic relapsing illness is essential and emergence of anxiety with or without treatment should be promptly treated. Sudden discontinuation may lead to emergence of withdrawal symptoms thus early recognition by the patient and the family helps in prompt treatment. MANAGEMENT AS PER THE DIFFERENT STAGES OF THE ILLNESS The treatment recommendations for the different anxiety disorders are summarized in Table I. Some antianxiety drugs are effective in all anxiety disorders, whereas some drugs have only been studied in specific anxiety disorders and thus should be reserved for use in these particular disorders. Panic disorder and agoraphobia. In acute panic attacks, mouth desolving short-acting benzodiazepines and reassurance to the patient may be sufficient. SSRIs SNRIs are first-line treatments for longterm management. Patients should be treated for atleast six to eight months or longer to prevent relapses. A combination of CBT and anxiolytic medication has been shown to have the best treatment outcomes. In GAD and Social anxiety disorder (SAD): Choice of Drugs for Management are SSRIs, SNRIs and pregabalin. Buspirone and hydroxyzine are second line treatment. Benzodiazepines should only be used for long-term treatment when other drugs or CBT have not shown results. Specific phobia: Specific phobia should be treated with behaviour therapy including systematic desensatisation. SSRIs or short acting benzodiazepines should be tried in cases not responding to behaviour therapy. OCD: Choice of treatments is the SSRIs and the TCA clomipramine. Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) and exposure and response prevention are other proven techniques of management. PTSD: Choice of treatments includes the SSRIs and venlafaxine. Therapeutic conversation, psychoeducation and regrief therapy are non-pharmacological treatment techniques advocated. TREATMENT UNDER SPECIAL CONDITIONS (FLOW CHART-3)FLOW CHART 3. Management of Anxiety Disorders in Special PopulationPregnancy. The use of SSRIs and TCAs in pregnancy does not have increased risk for malformations. It is recommended to avoid paroxetine alprazolam use among pregnant women or women planning to become pregnant. Breast-feeding. SSRIs and TCAs are excreted into breast milk, they do not cause any harm to the new born because the concentration in breast milk is very small however infants of mothers on benzodiazepines, should be observed for signs of sedation, lethargy, poor suckling, and weight loss, and if high doses have to be used and long-term administration is required, breast feeding should probably be discontinued. Treating children and adolescents. Choice of treatment should be SSRIs concerns about increased risk of suicidal ideation and behavior have ben reported therefore careful monitoring is advisable, presence of comorbid depression should be looked fore. Treating the elderly. Elderly have increased sensitivity for anticholinergic properties, an increased risk for orthostatic hypotension, and ECG changes during treatment with TCAs, and possible paradoxical reactions to benzodiazepines, which include depression, with or without suicidal tendencies, phobias, aggressiveness, or violent behavior. Thus, treatment with TCAs or benzodiazepines is less favorable, while SSRIs appear to be safe. Treatment of patients with severe Physical disease. Patients with cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and endocrine disease, irritable bowel syndrome, malignency, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) hyperthyroidism may have associated anxiety reactions with their somatic disease state. Such anxiety disorders may compound the management and the prognosis of these primary conditions. Advocated pharmacological agents in such conditions include SSRIs and Venlafaxine. WHEN TO STOP TREATMENT Decesion to stop treatment will depend on clinical response of the patients. Usualy the treatment is stopped in a tapering manner after atleast 6 months stability of clinical improvement and asymptomatic status of the patient. Before stopping the treatment, the nature of illness possibilities of recurrence, response to triggers and his/her ability to cope with the situation should be discussed at length. Patient's personal view should be included in decesion making of stopping the treatment. Patient should be encouraged to adapt alternative methods of anxiety reduction like yoga, pranayam, relaxation techniques including progressive muscular relaxation (PMR)/Shavasan etc. which can be mastered by him before weaning off the smallest dose of antianxiety medication. Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Behavior Therapy (MBCBT) for reducing cognitive and somatic anxiety and modifying dysfunctional cognitions in patients with anxiety disorders has been tried where in different versions of mindfulness meditation, cognitive restructuring, and strategies to handle worry, such as, worry postponement, worry exposure, and problem solving have been employed. However, these studies are on small number of patients and need carefull review for further application. MANAGEMENT OF SIDE EFFECTS OF MEDICATION Diffrent side effects will emerge with different category of antianxiety medication. They should be carefully observed and addressed to. Side effects of medication can be drug related or dose related. If it is drug, related, alternative class of drug should be tried for adequate length of time. If it is dose related then the dose of the drug has to be reduced. Things to remember for GAD: Anticholinergic and cardiovascular side effects to be kept in mind when using tricyclic and Tetra cyclic for side effects. Precaution in suicidal patients. Long-term treatment may be required. Psychopharmacological therapy combined with psychotherapy works better.",

The term of \"sedation of psychocomportemental troubles\" is more common and seems to have a less pejorative connotation.

      "abstract": "tress has been defined in different ways over the years.Originally, it was conceived of as pressure from the environment, then as strain within the person.The generally accepted definition today is one of interaction between the situation and the individual.It is the psychological and physical state that results when the resources of the individual are not sufficient to cope with the demands and pressures of the situation.Thus, stress is more likely in some situations than others and in some individuals than others.Stress can undermine the achievement of goals, both for individuals and for organisations (box 1).Signs of stress can be seen in people's behaviour, especially in changes in behaviour.Acute responses to stress may be in the areas of feelings (for example, anxiety, depression, irritability, fatigue), behaviour (for example, being withdrawn, aggressive, tearful, unmotivated), thinking (for example, difficulties of concentration and problem solving) or physical symptoms (for example, palpitations, nausea, headaches).If stress persists, there are changes in neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, autonomic and immunological functioning, leading to mental and physical ill health (for example anxiety, depression, heart disease) (box 2, fig 1). 1 Situations that are likely to cause stress are those that are unpredictable or uncontrollable, uncertain, ambiguous or unfamiliar, or involving conflict, loss or performance expectations.Stress may be caused by time limited events, such as the pressures of examinations or work deadlines, or by ongoing situations, such as family demands, job insecurity, or long commuting journeys.Resources that help meet the pressures and demands faced at work include personal characteristics such as coping skills (for example, problem solving, assertiveness, time management) and the work situation such as a good working environment and social support.These resources can be increased by investment in work infrastructure, training, good management and employment practices, and the way that work is organised.Historically, the typical response from employers to stress at work has been to blame the victim of stress, rather than its cause.Increasingly, it is being recognised that employers have a duty, in many cases in law, to ensure that employees do not become ill.It is also in their long term economic interests to prevent stress, as stress is likely to lead to high staff turnover, an increase in sickness absence and early retirement, increased stress in those staff still at work, reduced work performance and increased rate of accidents, and reduced client satisfaction.Good employment practice includes assessing the risk of stress amongst employees.This involves:c looking for pressures at work which could cause high and long lasting levels of stress c deciding who might be harmed by these c deciding whether you are doing enough to prevent that harm. c HOW STRESS IS CAUSEDThe degree of stress experienced depends on the functioning of two protective physiological mechanisms:c \"Alarm reaction\".When confronted with a threat to our safety, our first response is physiological arousal: our muscles tense and breathing and heart rate become more rapid.This serves us well when the threat is the proverbial bull in the field rushing towards us.We either fight or flee.Present day threats tend to be more psychological-for example, unjustified verbal attack by a superior at work.It is usually not socially acceptable to act by \"fight or flight\", and an alternative means of expressing the resultant emotional and physical energy is required.This falls in the arena of assertive communication.c \"Adaptation\".The second adaptive mechanism allows us to cease responding when we learn that stimuli in the environment are no longer a threat to our safety.For example, when we first spend time in a house near a railway line, our response to trains hurtling past is to be startled, as described above.Over time, our response dwindles.If this process did not function, we would eventually collapse from physical wear and tear, and mental exhaustion.",

The psychiatric symptoms associated with cannabis use are agitation, insomnia, depressive or raised mood, anxiety, hallucinations, and concentration problems. It is known that cannabis use increases the risk for psychoses and bipolar disorders and may deteriorate the clinical presentation of pre-existing psychoses and bipolar disorders. A characteristic symptom of autoscopic psychosis is visual hallucination of some part or the entirety of a person’s body, imitating his or her behaviors and being perceived as if seen in a mirror. This is not a specific symptom of any mental disorder and the cause is not definitively known. In this case presentation, the symptoms of a patient diagnosed with cannabis use-associated autoscopic psychosis are discussed in the context of the literature.",

      "title": "REM sleep and emotion regulation",
      "abstract": "Despite substantial research focusing on the interaction between sleep and cognition, especially memory, the impact of sleep and sleep loss on affective and emotional regulation has comparatively attracted much less attention. This might be surprising considering that nearly all psychiatric and neurological disorders with impaired mood express co-occurring abnormalities of sleep, and that many sleep disorders are accompanied by mood disturbances, thus suggesting an intimate relationship between sleep and emotion. Yet, recent studies evaluating subjective as well as objective measures of mood and affect, combined with insights from clinical observations and neuroimaging research, offer new evidence for the emerging role of sleep in regulating emotional brain function. In this chapter, we review clinical and neuroimaging data that support the existence of such complex interactions between sleep and emotion regulation. We report that (1) sleep disorders are frequently associated with affective symptoms; (2) patients with mood disorders often present with sleep disturbances; (3) sleep deprivation may transitorily alleviate depressive symptoms; (4) dream experiences may be highly emotional; (5) brain regions involved in emotion processing and regulation, such as the limbic (e.g., amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex) and ventromedial prefrontal regions, are strongly activated during REM sleep; (6) subjective mood assessments exhibit a circadian modulation. New data also show that some hypothalamic neuropeptides (hypocretin/orexin) play a dual role in the stabilization of sleep–wake states and on mesolimbic dopamine activity, with significant effects on neural plasticity related to emotional learning, reward processing, and addiction. Together, these seemingly disparate observations converge to indicate a physiological interplay between sleep–wake and emotional brain functions serving the modulation, the preparation, and the optimization of waking behavior.",

According to this hypothesis, 1 drug abuse begins as a partially successful attempt to assuage painful feelings. This does not mean seeking pleasure from the use of drugs. Rather, individuals predisposed by biological or psychological vulnerabilities find that drug effects corresponding to their particular problems are powerfully reinforcing. For example, clinical observations suggest that persons who have difficulty regulating mood may be particularly vulnerable to abuse of cocaine or other stimulant drugs, persons who have difficulty controlling anger to abuse of heroin and other opioids, and persons who have high anxiety levels to abuse of alcohol and other sedatives. Many drug abusers report that their drug helped them to feel normal, even before they developed physiological dependence with continued drug use necessary to prevent withdrawal symptoms. 1 Such clinical observations are supported by the recent",

      "abstract": "By some estimates, nearly half of patients with PD also suffer depression. Because features of PD frequently overlap with typical manifestations of major affective disorder (or mild dysthymia), both diagnosis and treatment of this comorbidity are challenging. Some of these interactive features include cognitive and speech deficits and impairments in emotional expression (e.g., PD-related facial masking) or processing. Parkinsonian depression probably is caused by an independent abnormality rather than as a maladaptive response to disease, in that the degree of depression is not correlated with PD severity. Prognostically, depressive features (e.g., introversion, inflexibility) may represent a subtle premorbid state heralding the onset of PD or an accelerated cognitive decline thereafter. Therapeutic mainstays for parkinsonian depression include psychosocial counseling at the time of PD diagnosis (and during advanced stages of PD) as well as appropriate medication regimens, the relative clinical efficacy of which remain a matter of ongoing clinical inquiry: levodopa, dopamine agonists, selegilene, tricyclic antidepressants, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors). This review formulates a rational treatment algorithm to assist in clinical management of parkinsonian depression, an enormously complex clinical entity.",

      "title": "Interpretative aspects of toxicological results",
      "abstract": "Forensic drug testing, by definition, is performed for legal or regulatory purposes and is often termed 'forensic toxicology'. Interpretation of forensic toxicology data depends on the type of specimens analyzed (e.g., blood, urine or breath) and the legal purpose of the testing. For impaired driving cases, interpretation is typically performed in the context of alcohol or drug concentrations specified in national or regional legislation. Impairment may or may not need to be proven, depending on the charges laid. For workplace and related drug testing the issue to be proven is simply the presence or absence of one of a small number of abused drugs at or above a specified concentration (the 'cut-off'); the determination is use of a specified drug, not whether that drug caused impairment. Drug-facilitated crime, including sexual assault, is more complex because the substance used/administered could be any one of a very wide range with potentially sedating properties. The inevitable delay in collecting blood or urine after the event will cause the concentration of most drugs to fall dramatically – typically well below the concentrations expected at the time of maximum effect – which is why analysis of hair from the victim may be useful. Post-mortem forensic toxicology is the most difficult subspecialty to deal with because of the wide range of drugs involved and difficulty of interpretation. Post-mortem changes can cause some blood drug concentrations to increase markedly after death in an unpredictable manner, whereas others deteriorate rapidly. Interpretation of post-mortem toxicology results requires considerable experience and a sound knowledge of anatomy and physiology, plus the pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of individual drugs. This chapter discusses the approaches to interpretation of results in each of the main areas of forensic toxicology.",

As polysomnography is not typically performed in the evaluation of insomnia, it is the challenge of the clinician to obtain a thorough history to determine if there are other signs or symptoms that may lead one to consider the diagnosis of sleep-disordered breathing in this group of patients. Treatment of concurrent sleep-disordered breathing and insomnia may also pose a challenge, as both disorders may need to be addressed for successful resolution of symptoms.",

      "abstract": "The effects of the psilocybin, a psychomimetic substance, on mental junctioning were investigated in normal volunteers as well as in schizophrenics. The disturbances induced constitute a psychoneurotoxic syndrome--\"a state of drunkenness\"--of about four hours duration which develops in three distinct phases. The basic mental symptoms of this syndrome consist of disturbances of the apperception, sensory perception and emotion. A moderate impairment of egofunctioning or reality appraisal and an inability to integrate different mental processes are observed. The psychomotor behavior is mainly harmonized to the prevailing emotional state and to the experiences caused by perceptual alterations, in a lesser degree. These changes, according to our observations, are more severe and more \"psychotic-like\" in schizophrenics rather than in normals. Psychopathological analysis of these changes proves that the whole syndrome cannot be considered as related to the spontaneously triggered functional psychoses or to the organic ones and, therefore, the term \"model-psychosis\" according to our opinion, is unsatisfactory.",

      "title": "Complex visual hallucinations. Clinical and neurobiological insights",
      "abstract": "Complex visual hallucinations may affect some normal individuals on going to sleep and are also seen in pathological states, often in association with a sleep disturbance. The content of these hallucinations is striking and relatively stereotyped, often involving animals and human figures in bright colours and dramatic settings. Conditions causing these hallucinations include narcolepsy-cataplexy syndrome, peduncular hallucinosis, treated idiopathic Parkinson's disease, Lewy body dementia without treatment, migraine coma, Charles Bonnet syndrome (visual hallucinations of the blind), schizophrenia, hallucinogen-induced states and epilepsy. We describe cases of hallucinosis due to several of these causes and expand on previous hypotheses to suggest three mechanisms underlying complex visual hallucinations. (i) Epileptic hallucinations are probably due to a direct irritative process acting on cortical centres integrating complex visual information. (ii) Visual pathway lesions cause defective visual input and may result in hallucinations from defective visual processing or an abnormal cortical release phenomenon. (iii) Brainstem lesions appear to affect ascending cholinergic and serotonergic pathways, and may also be implicated in Parkinson's disease. These brainstem abnormalities are often associated with disturbances of sleep. We discuss how these lesions, outside the primary visual system, may cause defective modulation of thalamocortical relationships leading to a release phenomenon. We suggest that perturbation of a distributed matrix may explain the production of similar, complex mental phenomena by relatively blunt insults at disparate sites.",

Primary sleep disturbances are thought to be a disorder of hyperarousal, while a hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysfunction has also been confirmed. Secondary sleep disorders have been associated with a large number of potential causes, both physical and psychological. Sleep disturbances in palliative care can be due to either the advanced disease and/or its treatment.

      "title": "Epilepsy and Psychosis",
      "abstract": "Psychosis is a significant comorbidity for a subset of patients with epilepsy, and may appear in various contexts. Psychosis may be chronic or episodic. Chronic Interictal Psychosis (CIP) occurs in 2-10% of patients with epilepsy. CIP has been associated most strongly with temporal lobe epilepsy. Episodic psychoses in epilepsy may be classified by their temporal relationship to seizures. Ictal psychosis refers to psychosis that occurs as a symptom of seizure activity, and can be seen in some cases of nonconvulsive status epilepticus. The nature of the psychotic symptoms generally depends on the localization of the seizure activity. Postictal Psychosis (PIP) may occur after a cluster of complex partial or generalized seizures, and typically appears after a lucid interval of up to 72 hours following the immediate postictal state. Interictal psychotic episodes (in which there is no definite temporal relationship with seizures) may be precipitated by the use of certain anticonvulsant drugs, particularly vigabatrin, zonisamide, topiramate, and levetiracetam, and is linked in some cases to “forced normalization” of the EEG or cessation of seizures, a phenomenon known as alternate psychosis. Seizures and psychosis may also co-occur secondary to another neurologic disorder, such as a traumatic brain injury, brain tumor, or limbic encephalitis. When a patient with epilepsy develops psychosis, the clinician should attempt to determine the cause, as treatment approach may vary. In this article, we review the various forms of epilepsy-related psychosis and discuss a rational approach to the evaluation and management of patients with epilepsy and psychosis.",

      "title": "Syndrome of Transient Headache and Neurological Deficits with Cerebrospinal Fluid Lymphocytosis (HaNDL): A Case Report - Is there an Association with the COVID-19 Vaccine?",
      "abstract": "Bartleson, 1981 described the syndrome of transient headache and neurologic deficits with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) lymphocytosis (HaNDL) for the first time.[1] HaNDL is classified as a \"headache attributed to nonvascular intracranial disorder\" and is included in the third edition of the International Classification of Headache Disorders.[2] HaNDL, a rare clinical entity, is diagnosed according to the following criteria: (1) episodes of migraine-like headache; (2) accompanied or shortly preceded by the onset of at least one transient neurological deficit lasting >4 h, and CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis (>15 white cells/mL), with negative etiological studies; (3) development or significant worsening of headache and transient neurological deficits in temporal relation to the onset or worsening of the CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis or led to its discovery, and/or have significantly improved in parallel with the improvement in the CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis; and (4) not better accounted for by another diagnosis. The syndrome resolves within 3 months.[2] Although the etiology of HaNDL is not precisely known, based on CSF lymphocytic pleocytosis, it is assumed to be associated with an autoimmune or infectious inflammatory disease. Cortical spreading depression may also cause neurologic deficits.[3] CSF lymphocytosis may be accompanied by elevated CSF total protein and CSF pressure that supports possible inflammation. Electroencephalography (EEG) may demonstrate focally abnormal areas consistent with focal neurological deficits. The neurological manifestations include sensory symptoms in approximately three-quarters, aphasia in two-thirds, and motor deficits in a little more than half of the cases.[2] Neurologic adverse events such as fever, headache, fatigue, and myalgia following coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccination are generally mild and transient. One of the most frequent neurological complaints reported after the COVID-19 vaccination is a headache. Twenty-eight-year-old female patient with migraine reported to our outpatient clinic with severe headache, speech disturbances, and right-sided sensory symptoms. She had a throbbing pain localized to the left hemisphere, accompanied by nausea and vomiting, and sensitivity to light and sound. The migraine attacks occurred once every 2 months and were responsive to simple analgesics. After the second dose of COVID-19 (BNT162b2-BioNTech) vaccination, the frequency and character of headache attacks changed. Distinct severe headaches were noted, and the frequency of headache attacks was increased to 15 days a month with a significantly reduced analgesic response. After 2 months of vaccination, severe headache attacks became chronic and right-sided hemi-hypesthesia and dysarthria appeared. There was no recent viral disease history except for the COVID-19 infection 8 months back during which she had mild symptoms. There was a minimal increase in the frequency of headaches without any change in character. However, dramatic changes occurred post-vaccination. Neurologic examination revealed mild dysarthria, and right hemi-hypesthesia with normoactive tendon reflexes, without any motor disturbance, neck stiffness, meningeal irritation signs, pathological reflexes, or cognitive dysfunction. A detailed blood work-up was performed, including vitamin B12 levels, and serological tests, all of which were within normal limits. Antinuclear antibody (ANA) was weakly positive (1/100) in the vasculitis panel. Detailed autoimmune and paraneoplastic antibody panels were all negative. Ophthalmological examination revealed no papilledema. Contrast-enhanced cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), non-contrast computerized tomography (CT), MR angiography (MRA), venography, and EEG were unremarkable. Lumbar puncture (LP) showed leukocytic pleocytosis with lymphocytic dominance (45 leukocytes-80% lymphocytes without erythrocytes). CSF opening pressure was 10 cm/CSF and analysis revealed normal protein (40 mg/dL) and normal glucose levels (61 mg/dL-serum: 79 mg/dL). The CSF viral panel, Gram stain, and culture were negative. After the exclusion of other differential diagnoses, HaNDL secondary to the COVID-19 vaccination was diagnosed and was followed closely with symptomatic treatment. The patient's clinical symptoms lasted for approximately 3 weeks and then disappeared spontaneously. During the 6-month follow-up period, there was no recurrence of neurologic deficits despite the occasional headache. There are different views on the etiology of HaNDL syndrome. The presence of inflammatory CSF findings suggests that infection and/or inflammation triggers the condition. Additionally, it is hypothesized that viral infection may activate the immune system and cause HaNDL syndrome.[4] The most important finding in support of this hypothesis is that some patients had a viral infection before the onset of symptoms.[5] After infection with COVID-19, persistent or new symptoms may develop for weeks or months, called long COVID or post-COVID syndrome. The symptoms may exceed 12 weeks. Common symptoms in people with long COVID are fatigue, headache, breathlessness, cough, chest pain, myalgia and weakness, insomnia, memory and concentration problems, and worsened quality of life.[6] Although the frequency of the patient's headache increased post-COVID-19 infection, it was vaccine-related rather than infection since the main change in headache character was post-vaccination. A known adverse event of COVID-19 vaccination is a headache. Patients with migraine-type headaches develop more headaches after COVID-19 vaccination compared to healthy controls.[7] In BNT162b2 clinical trials (manufactured by BioNTech and Pfizer), a higher incidence of headache was noted after the second dose than the first dose, with approximately 52% of patients reporting mild to moderate headaches.[8] In accordance with the literature data, headaches increased in our patients with a history of migraine, particularly after the second vaccination dose. Studies emphasize that the risk of headache after vaccination is increased twice and has a migrainous character in one-third of patients. Although the mechanisms underlying vaccine-induced headaches are still unclear, it may be owing to a systemic inflammatory response.[9] Vaccination with COVID-19 mRNA may cause an immunomodulatory response. The immune system stimulation following vaccination induces a strong T-cell response and increases CD8+ T cells and CD4+ T cells.[10] Although the neurological deficit developed in our patient 2 months after the vaccination, there was a significant and constant change in the frequency and character of the headaches immediately post-vaccination. Therefore, the neurological deficit added 2 months later was considered a continuation. In light of all these data and after excluding other differential diagnoses, the COVID-19 vaccination may be considered as a possible cause of HaNDL syndrome by triggering inflammation in our patient.

      "title": "Clinical management of antidepressant discontinuation.",
      "abstract": "To minimize the symptoms of antidepressant discontinuation, gradual tapering is necessary for all serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) except fluoxetine, which has an extended half-life. Agents with shorter half-lives such as venlafaxine, fluvoxamine, and paroxetine should be tapered gradually. Discontinuation symptoms, which frequently emerge after abrupt discontinuation or intermittent non-compliance and, less frequently, during dose reduction, are generally mild, short-lived, and self-limiting but can be distressing and may lead to missed work days and decreased productivity. The symptoms may be somatic (e.g., dizziness and light-headedness; nausea and vomiting; fatigue, lethargy, myalgia, chills, and other flu-like symptoms; sensory and sleep disturbances) or psychological (anxiety and/or agitation, crying spells, irritability). Mild symptoms can often be treated by simply reassuring the patient that they are usually transient, but for more severe symptoms, it may be necessary to reinstitute the dosage of the original antidepressant and slow the rate of taper. Symptoms of discontinuation may be mistaken for physical illness or relapse into depression; misdiagnosing the symptoms may lead to unnecessary, costly tests and treatment. Thus, health care professionals need to be educated about the potential adverse effects of SRI discontinuation.",

Gangguan tidur dapat mengganggu pertumbuhan fisik, emosional, kognitif, dan sosial orang dewasa. Insomnia pada lansia sering terjadi bersama-sama dengan kondisi lain yaitu berupa penyakit-penyakit fisik (hipertiroid, arthritis), penyakit-penyakit jiwa (depresi gangguan kecemasan) yang mengakibatkan seseorang tidak dapat tidur dengan baik. Lansia (lanjut usia) merupakan individu yang mencapai usia 60 tahun ke atas dan berada pada tahap akhir siklus kehidupan. Lansia mengalami proses penuaan yang melibatkan perubahan kumulatif pada tubuhnya, dimana jaringan dan sel-sel tubuhnya mengalami penurunan kapasitas fungsional. Lansia juga rentan terhadap berbagai penyakit atau sindroma karena kemampuan regeneratif tubuhnya yang terbatas dibanding kelompok usia lainnya. Salah satu terapi non- farmakologi yang dapat diterapkan untuk menurunkan insomnia pada lansia adalah dengan terapi dzikir. Terapi dzikir merupakan penanganan non-farmakologi yang dapat bermanfaat bagi lansia dengan insomnia karena tidak memiliki efek samping, dengan mekanisme tersebut dimana dzikir dapat membuat jiwa merasa nyaman dan tentram sehingga dapat mencegah insomnia pada lansia.",

Hacer una revision actualizada de algunos de estos sintomas no motores en cuanto a la fisiopatologia, epidemiologia, clinica y terapeutica. Desarrollo. Trastornos autonomicos como la dermatitis seborreica y los trastornos de la sudoracion, la fatiga, la perdida de peso o las alteraciones respiratorias (disnea, estridor inspiratorio) son sintomas muy prevalentes e incapacitantes, pueden ser el problema principal en alguna fase de la EP (fatiga, estridor) y condicionan la calidad de vida de los pacientes parkinsonianos. Es habitual no pensar en ellos y que no sean detectados por el medico. Aunque pueden responder a farmacos dopaminergicos, suelen precisar un enfoque terapeutico diferente. Son necesarios estudios que valoren nuevas perspectivas terapeuticas que actuen contra los mecanismos fisiopatologicos de estas alteraciones. Conclusiones. La EP afecta a otros sistemas distintos al dopaminergico nigroestriatal. Su mejor conocimiento permitira abordar y optimizar el tratamiento de los sintomas que condicionan, reforzando el bienestar de los pacientes con EP.",

      "title": "ALCOHOLIC EPILEPSY.",
      "abstract": "The term \"alcoholic epilepsy\" is comparatively new in medicine and describes a class of inebriates who have convulsive symptoms resembling epilepsy. Some writers call it a form of delirium tremens and acute alcoholism; others consider it a distinct epilepsy due to the toxic action of alcohol on the brain centers. In some instances the craving for alcohol precedes the paroxysm or epileptic fit like an aura or premonition. Sometimes the convulsion is intensified and increased by alcohol, or in other instances it may be neutralized and the direction of the symptom changed. The sudden maniacal impulse to become narcotized by alcohol, as seen in the dipsomaniac and periodic inebriates, closely resembles epilepsy. A number of cases have been noted where a distinct convulsion preceded the use of spirits and was followed by a continued impulse to drink. When this craving was neutralized by treatment, the convulsion returned. When spirits were",

      "abstract": "Neuropsychiatric abnormalities, as well as the commonly associated neuropsychological symptoms, are clinical characteristics of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), the most common form of dementia. Thus, in addition to a general cognitive and functional decline, neuropsychiatric manifestations, such as agitation, apathy, anxiety, psychoses and disinhibition, are frequently evident in AD patients. Such neuropsychiatric symptoms of AD are the source of considerable patient and caregiver distress, resulting in the prescription of neuroleptics, benzodiazepines or other psychotropic agents, and are a major factor in the decision to transfer the care of patients into nursing homes. Recent evidence suggests that some neuropsychiatric changes associated with AD are related to the cholinergic deficits in the brains of AD patients and that such abnormalities may be responsive to cholinergic therapy. Cholinergic drug therapies indicated for the symptomatic treatment of AD, for example tacrine and the newer cholinesterase (ChE) inhibitors such as donepezil, have been demonstrated to improve memory, language and praxis. Furthermore, although less is known about the effect of ChE inhibitors on the neuropsychiatric symptoms of AD, preliminary evidence suggests that they reduce apathy, anxiety, hallucinations, disinhibition and aberrant motor behaviour. Thus, the newer-generation ChE inhibitors that are well tolerated, easy to administer and show promise in reducing the cognitive, as well as neuropsychiatric disturbances of AD, may emerge as important treatments for some neuropsychiatric symptoms in patients with central cholinergic deficits, including AD.",

      "title": "A Rare Cause of a Treatable Abnormal Movement, Not to Miss",
      "abstract": "Parkinsonism is a syndrome composed of tremor at rest, bradykinesia, rigidity, loss of postural reflexes, flexed posture, and freezing.1 There are various acquired etiologies causing parkinsonism, such as dopaminergic blocking agents, cerebrovascular diseases, brain neoplasm, the intoxication of various toxins, brain trauma, and metabolic disturbances. Abnormal calcium metabolism causing hypo- or hypercalcemia can lead to adverse effects of the human nervous system. Although neurological manifestations of hypercalcemia mainly present as an alteration of consciousness or depression, the manifestations of hypocalcemia range from muscle twitching, spasms, tetanic contraction, numbness, altered mental status, encephalopathy, and seizures.2, 3 Movement disorders, such as chorea and parkinsonism, are unusual complications of hypocalcemia. Herein, we report a case of hypocalcemia attributed to post-thyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism that presented with acute parkinsonism and psychomotor retardation. Those symptoms were dramatically improved after correcting hypocalcemia. A 74-year-old Thai woman had been diagnosed with hypertension for 7 years. She had been taking enalapril 5 mg/day and propranolol 10 mg/day. She had had a thyroidectomy 30 years ago due to a large goiter. For 3 days, she was hospitalized because of a severe, disabling right-hand tremor and psychomotor retardation. She had a history of diarrhea and vomiting 4 to 5 times/day without fever for 5 days. Neurological examination demonstrated several parkinsonian features, including a masked face; chin tremor; and resting, postural, and intention tremors at the right upper extremity. Bradykinesia presented in both the upper and lower extremities bilaterally (Video 1, segment 1). She also developed severe psychomotor retardation and attention deficit. Trousseau's and Chvostek's signs were negative. In segment 1 (pretreatment), physical examination revealed signs of parkinsonism, including masked face, chin tremor, resting, postural, and intention tremor approximately 3 to 4 Hz at the right upper extremities. Bradykinesia presented both upper and lower extremities bilaterally. Wide-based gait and decreased arm swing on both sides predominantly on the right were observed. In segment 2 (posttreatment), after 4 days of calcium supplementation, parkinsonian symptoms and psychomotor retardation were markedly improved. In segment 3 (posttreatment), after 8 months of proper calcium supplementations, parkinsonian symptoms have not recurred. Video content can be viewed at https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mdc3.13540 Routine blood chemistry showed acute kidney injury (blood urea nitrogen of 36.4 mg/dL, creatinine of 2.22 mg/dL, baseline creatinine of 1.2 mg/dL) with severe hypocalcemia (4.4 g/dL; normal range, 8.8–10.2 mg/dL), normal serum albumin (4.3 g/dL), hyperphosphatemia (7.8 mg/dL; normal range, 2.5–4.5 mg/dL), hypomagnesemia (1.0 mg/dL; normal range, 1.6–2.6 mg/dL), a low 25-hydroxyvitamin D level (21.4 ng/mL; normal range, ≥ 30 ng/mL), and a low parathyroid hormone level (8.13 pg/mL; normal range, 15–65 pg/mL). An electrocardiogram showed a prolonged QT interval. Axial T2 fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequence of the brain magnetic resonance imaging showed a diffuse patchy confluence over the bilateral periventricular white matter without evidence of acute ischemic stroke by diffusion-weighted imaging and apparent diffusion coefficient, and brain computer tomography showed calcification at the bilateral globus pallidus (Fig. 1). Lumbar puncture was performed. The result was normal, including a negative viral meningoencephalitis panel. Hypocalcemia was corrected by intravenous calcium gluconate, and plasma calcium level was monitored closely. After 4 days of treatment, plasma calcium returned to the normal level concomitant with a remarkable improvement of both the parkinsonism and psychomotor speed (Video 1, segment 2). The patient was discharged from the hospital 7 days after admission. Calcium and vitamin D supplements were prescribed without dopaminergic medication. 18F-fluorodopa and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography were performed. The results showed no evidence of abnormal presynaptic dopamine deficit and no hypometabolic pattern compatible with neurodegenerative parkinsonian syndromes (Fig. 1). At 8 months after taking calcium and vitamin D, the parkinsonism had vanished and never recurred (Video 1, segment 3). We report a case of acute parkinsonism and psychomotor retardation attributed to hypocalcemia, which was a complication of post-thyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism. Parkinsonism in patients with hypocalcemia is rare. Its frequency increases in chronic hypocalcemia (Video 2). Full video from the 2021 Video Challenge discussion of this case. Video content can be viewed at https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mdc3.13540 The neurological manifestations of hypocalcemia can occur in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and central nervous system (CNS). In the PNS, signs and symptoms of neuromuscular hyper-excitability including muscle twitching, tetanic contraction, trismus, and opisthotonos can be observed. The manifestations in CNS include encephalopathy, seizures, and, rarely, movement disorders.3-5 Hypocalcemia can result from hypoparathyroidism, pseudohypoparathyroidism, and post-thyroidectomy hypoparathyroidism.6 Early evidence of the association between parkinsonism and hypocalcemia in patients with hypoparathyroidism was reviewed by McKinney.5 He reviewed cases of hypoparathyroidism and hypocalcemia with symptoms other than tetany between 1950 and 1960, finding that 3 of 90 patients had presented with parkinsonism. He also found calcification of the basal ganglion did not correlate with the presentation of abnormal movements.5 Subsequently, Abe and colleagues reported a summary of published cases of hypocalcemia attributed to hypoparathyroidism presenting with movement disorders.6 They found 31 reported cases in the literature published between 1965 to 1994.6 Of those, 18 cases presented with parkinsonism including their own cases.6 We have summarized the reports of parkinsonism associated with hypocalcemia to date in Table 1.7-11 Mood: improved Parkinsonism: persisted Brain imaging of hypocalcemia frequently showed basal ganglia calcifications, especially in chronic hypoparathyroidism.2 Precipitation of calcium-phosphorus hydroxyapatite crystals in the basal ganglia and cerebellum of patients with hypoparathyroidism has been proposed as the possible pathogenesis for developing movement disorders in patients with hypoparathyroidism.10 However, this hypothesis cannot explain why some patients with hypoparathyroidism develop movement disorders despite the absence of basal ganglia calcification. Our patient had experienced acute parkinsonism and psychomotor retardation attributed to hypocalcemia caused by hypoparathyroidism. Despite its rarity, hypocalcemia could be a treatable cause of acute parkinsonism. Physicians should be aware of this condition, and it should not be missed. Early recognition and prompt treatment provides excellent clinical outcomes. 1. Research project: A. Conception, B. Organization, C. Execution; 2. Statistical Analysis: A. Design, B. Execution, C.

      "abstract": "Introduction Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder (HPPD) is a syndrome characterized by prolonged or reoccurring perceptual symptoms, reminiscent of acute hallucinogen effects. HPPD was associated with a broader range of LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide)-like substances, including cannabis, MDMA (methylenedioxymethamphetamine), psilocybin, mescaline and other psychostimulants. Symptomatology mainly comprises visual disorders (i.e., geometric pseudo-hallucinations, halos, flashes of colours/lights, motion-perception deficits, afterimages, micropsy, more acute awareness of floaters, etc.), even though depressive symptoms and thought disorders may be comorbidly present. Objective Although HPPD was firstly described in 1954, it was definitely established as a syndrome in 2000 with the revised forth version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR). However, neuronal substrate, risk factors, aetiology and pathogenesis of HPPD remains still unknown and under investigation. Furthermore, there are still open questions about its pharmacological targets. Aims A critical review on psychopathological bases, etiological hypothesis and psychopharmacological approaches towards HPPD was here provided. Methods A systematic literature search on PubMed/Medline, GoogleScholar and Scopus databases without time restrictions, by using a specific set of keywords was here carried out. In addition, a case report was here described. Results and conclusions Pharmacological and clinical issues are here considered and practical psychopharmacological recommendations and clinical guidelines here suggested.

      "abstract": "Introduction Psychosis in childhood and adolescence could be defined as having hallucinations, with the hallucinations occurring in the absence of insight. A broader definition includes symptoms such as delirious thoughts, disorganized speech, disorganized behavior, cognitive and mood symptoms and what is called negative symptoms. Several researches have been done focused in the treatment of first episode of psychosis showing clozapine as a keystone in the treatment of psychosis, especially in refractory first episodes. Objectives Clozapine has unique efficacy in improving treatment-resistant patients with chronic schizophrenia but the moment of instauration remains unclear. There have always been doubts about the right moment to start clozapine, after two or more previous anti-psychotics or as first option. Materials and methods We report a 18-year- old woman with family history of severe psychosis. Her mum reasserted patient's symptoms contributing to a longer period of non-treating psychosis (about 10 months). Auditory hallucinations, incongruent mood and incoherent language appeared for the first time at the age of 17. High doses of two consecutive anti-psychotics were tried without remission and finally clozapine was initiated with clinical improvement. Discussion In clinical practice, a subgroup of psychotic patients experience, significant ongoing positive symptoms despite of using first line anti-psychotic medication. Conclusion Most recent research; suggest that clozapine may have an important role in the early treatment of first-episode patients, even becoming a first line option to consider.

      "abstract": "The decline in cognitive function is a core feature of dementias. However, other symptoms of the disease are also crucial. These symptoms are the behavioral and psychological manifestations of dementia and include symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, delusional misindentification syndromes (DMS), illusions, anxiety, aggression, depression, personality changes, disinhibition-impulsivity, violation of social and moral norms, changes in dietary or eating behavior and repetitive behaviors. Delusions, hallucinations, anxiety, depression and aggression are highly prevalent in Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies, whereas symptoms that include severe disturbance of behavior are highly prevalent in frontotemporal dementias. Psychotic symptoms are associated with subcortical disturbances mainly of the limbic system. Patients with depression present greater loss of noradrenergic cells in the locus coeruleus and loss of serotonergic nuclei of dorsal raphe. Furthermore, disturbances of behavior are associated with frontal lobe dysfunction. Atypical antipsychotics is the first treatment option for delusions, hallucinations, misidentifications, anxiety and aggression. Furthermore, antidepressants may be useful for moderate or severe depression as well as for disinhibition-impulsivity, aggression, changes in dietary or eating behavior and repetitive behaviors. Cholinesterase inhibitors may also improve apathy, anxiety, disinhibition, aberrant behavior, mood disorders and hallucinations. Moreover, non-pharmacological methods alone or in combination with psychotropic drugs may also improve patient's symptomatology.",

La experiencia clinica muestra situaciones concretas donde es probable que exista una cierta confusion de terminos. Asi, se pueden entender de manera erronea como sedacion paliativa los casos de tratamiento sintomatico del delirium hiperactivo en la etapa de ultimos dias (una situacion que se presenta a menudo como la primera causa de sedacion en agonia) o aquellos en que se lleva a cabo un aumento progresivo de la medicacion paliativa, que con frecuencia puede tener un efecto sedante, paralelo a la mayor intensidad de los sintomas en enfermos con un deterioro severo debido a la progresion de la enfermedad. En ambos casos se emplean farmacos con efecto sedante para aliviar las complicaciones clinicas y el sufrimiento en un enfermo que tiene la muerte cercana pero las circunstancias del enfermo, el objetivo de estos tratamientos y el modo en que se emplean no coinciden con la definicion de sedacion paliativa. EnglishPalliative sedation in defined as the deliberate reduction in the level of consciousness of the patient by administering the appropriate drugs in order to avoid intense suffering caused by one or more refractory symptoms; sedation in the patient who is in his last days or hours of life is assumed to be continuous and as deep as needed. Clinical experience shows specific situations where it is likely that there is some confusion of terms. We could erroneously understand as palliative sedation the cases of symptomatic treatment of hyperactive delirium in a patient in its last days (a situation that sometimes is presented as the first cause of palliative sedation) or those in which it is carried out a progressive increase in the palliative treatment that often have a sedative effect, parallel to the increased severity of symptoms because of disease progression in severe ill patients. In both scenarios, sedating drugs are used to relieve end-of-life clinical complications and suffering but the circumstances of the patient, the goal of these treatments, and the way they are used do not match the definition of sedation.",

Cerebral palsy affects two to three children per 1,000 live-born. Typological characteristics of the clinical image of cerebral palsy are the modified muscle tone characterized by muscular tension, altered body posture and disturbed motion. Cerebral palsy is a disorder of the central nervous system, so it affects the whole development and functioning of the physical psychomotor development of a child. It is accompanied by developmental disorders, sensomotor disorders, perceptual cognitive developmental disorders, socioemocional disorders and difficulties in functioning of everyday life, auditory - visual and other perceptual disorders, intellectual deficit, etc., and may be accompanied by epilepsy. Cerebral palsy, although a permanetn diagnosys, depending on the degree of damage, can be treated using different treatment methods and therapies such as kinesitherapy can which can significantly influence the overall functioning of the affected person. The key precondition is early detection and propercorrective and therapeutic or curative action. Kinesitheraphy as a motion treatment method can have a significant effect on treating a person, raising the body's psychomotor status and the quality of everyday life. Methods used, based on clinical kinesiology, and appropriate exercise and modification, kinesitherapy has positive effects in treating the condition of people with cerebral palsy",

      "abstract": "A esquizofrenia é uma doença mental crônica que afeta a maneira como uma pessoa pensa, sente e se comporta. Caracterizada por sintomas como delírios, alucinações, confusão e dificuldade de concentração, seus sintomas podem variar em intensidade e frequência, geralmente se manifestando na adolescência ou início da idade adulta. Afetando cerca de 1% da população mundial, a esquizofrenia tem raízes em uma complexa interação entre fatores genéticos, neurobiológicos e ambientais. Alterações nos neurotransmissores, como dopamina e glutamato, desempenham um papel significativo na fisiopatologia da doença, que também está ligada a anomalias estruturais e funcionais do cérebro. O diagnóstico da esquizofrenia é feito através de uma avaliação clínica detalhada, com critérios estabelecidos como os do DSM-5 ou CID-10. O tratamento geralmente envolve uma combinação de medicamentos antipsicóticos, como clorpromazina, haloperidol, olanzapina, risperidona e quetiapina, e terapia psicossocial. A escolha do medicamento depende de vários fatores, incluindo a gravidade dos sintomas e a tolerabilidade do paciente. Embora esses medicamentos sejam eficazes no controle dos sintomas, eles podem estar associados a efeitos colaterais, e é essencial monitorar de perto os pacientes durante o tratamento. Um estudo recente revisou a literatura dos últimos 5 anos sobre métodos terapêuticos medicamentosos para o controle da esquizofrenia. Foram selecionados 6 estudos que abordaram tratamentos eficazes para a esquizofrenia, incluindo medicamentos como xanomelina, tróspio, dexmedetomidina, raloxifeno, tropissetron, blonanserina e olanzapina. Esses estudos mostraram redução dos sintomas da esquizofrenia, apesar de apresentarem diferentes perfis de efeitos colaterais e eficácia. Mais pesquisas são necessárias para compreender totalmente o potencial de cada medicamento no tratamento desse transtorno. Em suma, a esquizofrenia é uma condição que requer uma abordagem holística e colaborativa, com tratamentos eficazes e monitoramento cuidadoso dos pacientes para melhorar sua qualidade de vida.",

      "title": "Is it time to end our complicity with pharmacocentricity?",
      "abstract": "Psychotropic medications have traditionally dominated the treatment of mental health problems. The administration of psychotropic medications and monitoring for effects, side effects, and adherence therefore consumes considerable time for mental health nurses (MHN). While there is no doubt many people believe psychotropic medications have helped them, the weight of research evidence questioning their effectiveness and exposing their associated debilitating side effect burden (particularly over the long term) is now too compelling to be ignored. This has prompted the claim that, on balance, psychotropic medications cause more harm than good (Gotzche et al. 2015). The most commonly prescribed psychotropic medications are antidepressants and antipsychotics, yet these names are misleading. They create the impression that psychotropic medications remove a pathogen like an antibiotic removes a bacteria, when this is not the case (Rosenman 2016). Unlike physical conditions such as diabetes, Crohn's disease or cystic fibrosis, for example, there is no pathophysiology or a single identifiable biomarker associated with any psychiatric diagnosis. Diagnoses such as ‘schizophrenia’ or ‘bipolar disorder’ are based on a consensus model and therefore represent simply one version of the truth, not established scientific facts (Wand 2015). The rationale supporting psychotropic medications is based on the assumption that mental illnesses are predominantly biological and are ameliorated at a neurochemical level, conveying the message to the ‘sufferer’ that they are biologically inferior (Hall 2018). However, there is no evidence that mental illness is due to a chemical imbalance of the brain, and while genetics and biology play a role in all aspects of the human condition, the degree to which genetics and biology influence mental health and well-being remains a matter of speculation. What is known (without question) is that mental health and well-being are predominantly determined by what happens to people after they are born, not what they are born with. Childhood adversity and instability, abuse and neglect, socio-economic disadvantage, discrimination, bullying, rape, incarceration, war, substance misuse, and human rights violations all make far greater contributions to mental ill-health than heredity (World Health Organization, 2013). Indeed, it is disrespectful, and unrealistic, to expect that a medication will mend such harrowing experiences. For example, it is reported that hearing voices in 77% of people diagnosed with ‘schizophrenia’ is related to traumatic experiences. The widely held contemporary view is that voice hearing is a normal human experience that voices have meaning for individuals and are ‘parts of the self’ that should not be ignored. People are encouraged to accept voices and establish a dialogue with them. Conversely, attempting to ‘get rid’ of voices through medication interferes with emotional processing and understanding the meaning of voices (Mosquera & Ross 2017). Several studies have identified that antidepressants are little or no better than placebo for the majority of people with depression (Barbui et al. 2011; Fournier et al. 2010; Khan & Brown 2015; Kirsch et al. 2008). This has attracted little mainstream media attention. Yet curiously, a recent systematic review and network meta-analysis published in the Lancet by Cipriani et al. (2018) which reported only modest effect sizes from 522 trials of 21 antidepressants evoked media claims that the debate on antidepressant effectiveness was now over, because this study proved antidepressants ‘worked’ (Boseley 2018; Rice-Oxley 2018). Following the publication of this review, numerous critiques of the study emerged online. The essence of these criticisms is encompassed by McCormack and Korownyk (2018). They highlight that the review rated 82% of studies as having moderate to high risk of bias and that 78% of studies (when declared) were funded by pharmaceutical companies. Reviews such as these do not identify who or how many people should be treated with antidepressants, especially given an estimated 30–40% of placebo groups report improvement or remission. A major criticism is that claims of antidepressant effectiveness are typically based on 6- to 8-week clinical trials. Assertions that antidepressants work neglect long-term effects (and outcomes) from taking antidepressants, and the comparative benefits and harms relative to nonpharmacological approaches (McCormack & Korownyk 2018). Importantly, the authors of the study were not nearly as confident of the claims made by media outlets, for example conceding that ‘Depressive symptoms tend to spontaneously improve over time and this phenomenon contributes to the high percentage of placebo responders in antidepressant trials’ (Cipriani et al. 2018, pp. 1363). This conforms to the widespread recognition that improvement in depressive symptoms is often due to the passage of time, or placebo effect. Individuals (and the prescriber), however, tend to give antidepressants credit they do not deserve. Whittaker (2016) has published an extensive review and analysis of the research literature on antipsychotics from the 1950s to the present. This longitudinal perspective reveals that antipsychotic medications may provide short-term benefits, but on the whole, they worsen long-term outcomes. The conclusion drawn is that antipsychotics induce physiological changes in the brain leaving individuals more vulnerable to psychosis. The collective research examined indicates that long-term use of antipsychotic medications worsen psychotic symptoms, and impairs functional capacities, making individuals more ‘socially dependent’ than before their illness. Conversely, longitudinal studies from the USA, Netherlands, and Australia have all found that minimal or no use of antipsychotics is associated with better outcomes. Essentially, antipsychotic medications increase the ‘chronicity of schizophrenia’ and other psychotic conditions and impede recovery (Whittaker 2016). These assertions are supported by Harrow and Jobe (2018) who agree that while antipsychotic medications demonstrate short-term benefits, there are now eight major studies that fail to find better outcomes for individuals with ‘schizophrenia’ treated with antipsychotic medications on a long-term basis. In their study, Harrow et al. (2017) followed up 139 people diagnosed with ‘schizophrenia’ and ‘schizoaffective disorder’ over 20 years. Their findings show significant differences and large effect sizes in work functioning in favour of individuals not prescribed antipsychotic medication long term. In general, people continuously prescribed antipsychotics were significantly more likely to have negative symptoms than those not prescribed antipsychotics at 4.5 years follow-up. Moreover, a large percentage of those individuals continuously prescribed antipsychotics were rehospitalized multiple times. The authors maintain that any hypothesis based on antipsychotics facilitating work functioning is dubious and that no strong evidence exists for the treatment of antipsychotic medication beyond three years (Harrow et al. 2017). Additionally, concerns have been raised over the widespread off-label use of antipsychotics such as quetiapine for the treatment of anxiety, insomnia, post-traumatic stress, ‘personality disorders’, dementia, and substance misuse when there is no evidence to support its use for these health problems (Brett 2015). There is growing awareness of the significant withdrawal and discontinuation effects of psychotropic medications, which are often distressing and can endure for many months after cessation. This phenomenon is reported in the scholarly literature (Cartwright et al. 2016; Hall 2018; Ostrow et al. 2017; Read et al. 2018) and mainstream media (Carey & Gebeloff 2018; Edemariam 2017). Traditionally, people have been informed that these symptoms are a ‘relapse’ of their condition and proof that the medication was working. This is not logical. For example, with regard to relapse studies and antipsychotic discontinuation, Whittaker (2016) argues it cannot be known from this research how much of the ‘relapse’ symptoms are due to a withdrawal effect, and how much might be interpreted as a (yet to be explicated) ‘return of the disease’. This uncertainty makes it impossible to draw conclusions from these studies about the long-term protective effects of antipsychotics against relapse (Whittaker 2016). Given the questionable effectiveness of psychotropic medications over the long term and their unquestionable side effect burden, the clear indication is that these medications (if prescribed at all) should be taken sparingly and for the shortest time possible, and nonpharmacological approaches emphasized. Thankfully, the number of nonpharmacological options available for enhancing mental health and well-being is extensive. From a psychiatric survivor perspective, Hall (2012) takes a pragmatic view of psychotropic medications proposing they can blunt or control symptoms of mental distress and consequently ‘take the edge’ off extreme states. However, they do not address the underlying causes of mental distress and are therefore best understood as tools or coping mechanisms that sometimes alleviate symptoms. A report from the Mental Health Commission of NSW (2015) titled Medication and mental illness: Perspectives provided valuable insights into what people want from their mental health clinicians and services with regard to psychotropic medication. While positive experiences with medications were highlighted, the far greater weight of opinion was negative. Consumers and carers identified that their concerns about medications (especially side effects and polypharmacy) were either ignored or dismissed. An emphasis on learning skills of self-care and self-management was preferred. In the report under the heading Towards change, a list summarized ‘what people told the Commission’; The dilemma now facing MHNs is how to respond to the recognition that psychotropic medications are conceivably causing more harm than good, especially the longer people take them. Services such as clozapine and depot clinics would not function without the support of MHNs, who are also routinely involved in compelling people to take psychotropic medications. Moreover, while programmes developed by MHNs to monitor and screen for side effects and complications from taking psychotropic medications are commendable (especially given the physical health complications encountered by people experiencing mental ill-health are principally iatrogenic in nature), the risk versus benefit ratio does not support the traditional view that people should be maintained on psychotropic medications long term. The ethical principle of nonmaleficence obliges MHNs to inform individuals (and their carers) of the effects, side effects, and current research on the effectiveness of these agents. Furthermore, people should be routinely informed of the contemporary understanding that mental health challenges are predominantly attributed to human experiences of adversity, instability, and trauma, rather than simply predetermined by biology or genetics.",

      "abstract": "Delirium is a common and severe neuropsychiatric syndrome characterized by acute changes in attention, cognition, and consciousness. It can present in different clinical forms, including hyperactive and hypoactive delirium. Hyperactive delirium is characterized by increased psychomotor activity, agitation, and disruptive behavior, while hypoactive delirium is characterized by reduced psychomotor activity, somnolence, and decreased responsiveness. The diagnosis of hyperactive and hypoactive delirium involves a comprehensive evaluation of medical history, physical examination, and laboratory tests to identify underlying causes and exclude other conditions. Prompt recognition and accurate diagnosis are crucial for appropriate management and treatment. The management of hyperactive and hypoactive delirium aims at addressing the underlying etiology, ensuring patient safety, and alleviating distressing symptoms. Treatment strategies include the optimization of medical conditions, discontinuation or adjustment of offending medications, and supportive care. Pharmacological interventions, such as the use of sedative medications for hyperactive delirium or stimulant agents for hypoactive delirium, may be considered when necessary. Multidisciplinary collaboration involving healthcare professionals, including physicians, nurses, and therapists, is essential for the comprehensive care of patients with hyperactive and hypoactive delirium. In conclusion, hyperactive and hypoactive delirium are distinct clinical manifestations of an acute confusional state. Their identification, diagnosis, and management require a multidimensional approach to address the underlying causes and alleviate symptoms. Early recognition and appropriate interventions are crucial for improving patient outcomes and enhancing their overall well-being.",

      "abstract": "Hallucinations are misperceptions of things or events with one or more senses when an internal or external trigger doesn’t exist. They can be divided into visual, audioverbal, olfactorical, tactile and gustatory. Hallucinations develop due to 3 main pathophysiologicalmechanisms: psychophysiological, psychobiochemical (neurohormone dependent) and psychodynamic. Etiology of these perceptions consists of many things and is not always binned to psychiatric illnesses. These are some of the etiological factors which will be mentioned further bellow: psychosis, delirium, dementia, Charles Bonnet syndrome, Anton syndrome, seizures, migraine, Lhermitte syndrome, sleep disorders and “Alice in Wonderland” syndrome. Audioverbal hallucinations are thought to be a misperceptionof one’s own thoughts which are understood as the speech of someone else. This happens because of distorted function of frontotemporal efferents. These parts of brain are known for their sensorial region activation in the brain and also for the identification and perception of triggers that arise in a person. Furthermore, and increased activity of Wernicke’s region, right putamen, thalamus, and nucleus caudatus was also noticed. During the events of audioverbalhallucinations increased activity of Broca’s region and dorsal cortex of gyrus cinguli were noticed. Subcortical structures might also be the reason or the regulating part of the brain responsiblefor the manifestation of hallucinations which originate in the cortex. Visual hallucinations appear after triggering the primary or associational visual cortex, deafferetion mechanism, when there is some sort of damage to the periferial or central parts of nervous system responsible for visual perceptions. In addition, sleep and wakefulness cycles might be unbalanced and there can be some cognitive disorders.",

Epilepsy can cause many consequences, such as using long-term antiepileptic drugs.It is important to know when drug administration starts and the right drug selection. The choice of type of drug is mainly based on the type of seizure. Other factors to consider are the age of the patient and the existing comorbidities. In the course of efforts to achieve seizure free, sometimes the addition of drugs or drug substitution is needed. Absolute drug substitution is done if serious side effects occur to the patient. The other indication of drug substitution is if there is no improvement in the frequency and severity of the seizure.After a seizure-free period is reached, the next problem is when to stop the drug. Discontinuation of the drug has the consequence of the risk of recurrent seizures. But on the other hand, the cessation of AED in some cases corrects the side effects that arise from the drug. Some literatures suggest the termination of OAE begins after 3 years of seizure free. But when referring to the definition of epilepsy issued by ILAE in 2014, that epilepsy is considered to be resolved for individuals who have remained seizure-free for the last 10 years, with no seizure medicines for the last 5 years, then the cessation of the drug is carried out after 5 years of seizure-free period.",

There are many physiological changes in sleep such as fall in blood pressure, decrease in heart rate, reduction in pH of the blood, reduction in urine secretion, decrease in metabolic rate, slow and regular breathing, muscular relaxation and the disappearance of deep reflex actions, but almost any of these physiological changes may be absent in a sleep which is normal in all other respects. It is therefore more accurate to refer to the physiological accompaniments than to the physiology of sleep (Gillespie, 1929).",

Differential diagnosis should include obsessive-compulsive disorder, unipolar schizoaffective disorder, and tardive Tourette’s syndrome. Questions raised concerning the beneficial or worsening effect of specific medications applied with regard to the prominent psychopathology during the course of the disorder as well as the optimal treatment for such a case are also discussed.",

Therefore they may range from abnormal sleep-related movements to emotions, perceptions, dreaming, or behaviors. In the most complex forms even “basic drive state” may emerge, resulting in complex abnormal behaviors such as sleep-related eating disorder (SRED) or abnormal sexual behaviors.",

The patient had no history of psychiatric pathologies or any other eating disorder, but he did not rest adequately at night, was overweight and had a family and personal history of other sleep disorders. Since he did not respond to other treatments, we decided to try therapy with topiramate; as a result, the episodes disappeared, tolerance was excellent and effectiveness was maintained throughout the two years' follow-up.In this paper we review eating disorders that occur during sleep, nocturnal sleep-related eating disorder and its therapeutic possibilities, while highlighting the usefulness of topiramate to treat this condition.",

Results: the patient arrived with a significant voice change and after evaluation psychogenic dysphonia was diagnosed. The treatment involved vocal activation and modification of the fixed adjustment. Positive changes were observed such as stability in vocal patterns and reduction of hoarseness, roughness, breathiness and throat discomfort and in the quality of life related to voice, but these changes were not sustained since other existing health problems aggravated. Conclusion: speech therapy may be limited, although challenging, when psychogenic dysphonia occurs concomitantly to other diseases.",

      "title": "Management of blackouts and misdiagnosis of epilepsy and falls",
      "abstract": "‘Collapse?cause’ is a colloquial term that is widely used, especially in acute and emergency medical practice in the UK. Patients with ‘collapse?cause’ can be defined as having suffered ‘a physical collapse due to an abrupt loss of postural tone’. There may or may not have been accompanying loss of consciousness. Some patients with ‘collapse?cause’ will have suffered a stroke, others may have an acute metabolic disorder, such as hypoglycaemia, and others may have collapsed due to the effects of drugs. However, very many such patients with collapse will have suffered a ‘blackout’ (ie transient loss of consciousness (T-LOC)), with consequent collapse. It is these patients who most frequently present a diagnostic problem, since there will often be no symptoms, signs or laboratory findings of stroke, metabolic disorder or drug effect; they may have completely recovered upon admission; all the admitting doctor has to rely on is a second-hand ‘word-ofmouth’ description of the features of the blackout and collapse from bystanders, who are usually lay observers. It seems to be commonly assumed that T-LOC represents a primary neurological disturbance, and the differential diagnosis often focuses on epilepsy versus syncope. It is poorly understood that syncope is quite often convulsive, and may feature limb twitching and sometimes urinary incontinence. Syncope, defined ‘as transient loss of consciousness due to global impairment of cerebral perfusion’, 1 is very common, with up to 50% of the population having syncope at some stage in life. Syncope is the sixth most common cause of emergency admission in the UK, 2 accounting for 3% of all attendances to the emergency departments and 1% of all hospital admissions. In contrast, epilepsy affects about 0.5‐1% of the population. 3 Syncope is probably far more common than epilepsy, but this seems to go unrecognised. As a consequence, the misdiagnosis of epilepsy is very common, with 20‐30% of adults misdiagnosed with epilepsy, and a greater percentage of children. 3 The misdiagnosis of epilepsy is thought to cost the NHS about £200m per annum, and recent settlements for compensation in misdiagnosed and mistreated cases will further add to this cost. Misdiagnosis has been a feature in children, 4 but a major problem also exists with misdiagnosis in older patients.",

      "title": "Síndrome de sobreentrenamiento",
      "abstract": "El sindrome de sobreentrenamiento (SSE) se define como la dificultad para mantener el desempeno, no justificado por otras causas o morbilidades y que persiste mas alla de 2 semanas a pesar de un adecuado periodo de reposo o recuperacion. El SSE es un estado de disminucion del rendimiento fisico combinado con alteraciones en el estado de animo. Las manifestaciones mas frecuentes son disminucion del rendimiento, sensacion de piernas pesadas, perdida de la fuerza, disminucion del estado de animo, apatia, disminucion de autoestima, inquietud, irritabilidad y trastornos del sueno. Multiples teorias se han planteado en el intento de explicar la genesis del SSE: la inadecuada periodizacion de las cargas de entrenamiento que podria generar cambios tanto fisiologicos como psicologicos en los deportistas; la realizacion de actividades extradeportivas de tipo laborales, estudiantiles, situacion personal y la constante y ascendente presion social; cambios de horario, viajes; disfunciones hormonales posiblemente inducidas por el ejercicio. Otras hipotesis planteadas hacen referencia a la presencia de alteraciones en el sistema inmunologico;  eficiencia en las concentraciones plasmaticas de algunos aminoacidos; deplecion del glucogeno muscular e insuficiente consumo de calorias. Debido a la complejidad del sindrome, la variabilidad y poca especificidad en la presentacion de los sintomas, el diagnostico de SSE se realiza por exclusion de otras patologias y requiere un alto indice de sospecha y vigilancia por parte de los profesionales encargados del proceso de entrenamiento y de los mismos deportistas. Sin embargo los intentos de realizar dicho diagnostico por medio de una prueba o grupo de pruebas de laboratorio han sido hasta el momento infructuosos. Entre estas las que mejor correlacion han demostrado son las mediciones de cortisol, testosterona en ayunas, el indice cortisol/testosterona, las concentraciones de adrenocorticotrofina y hormona del crecimiento. En cuanto a pruebas diagnosticas clinicas, se han disenado desde tiempo atras una serie de cuestionarios basados en los sintomas frecuentemente reportados de SSE: el cuestionario del perfil del estado de animo; la escala de percepcion esfuerzo; el cuestionario de la sociedad francesa de medicina del deporte (SMFS); el cuestionario de estado estres-recuperacion para atletas; la utilizacion de zonas individuales de funcionamiento optimo. Al igual que con las pruebas de laboratorio, las herramientas de tipo clinico han demostrado en mayor o menor grado su utilidad y el uso de las mismas depende del conocimiento, la validacion local y la disposicion de estudios previos que certifiquen su sensibilidad y especificidad dentro de las diferentes poblaciones. Para nuestro pais una buena herramienta seria el cuestionario SMFS para deteccion de manifestaciones tempranas de SSE, el cual se encuentra adaptado transculturalmente para nuestra poblacion y que fue con exito empleado por nuestro grupo de trabajo para la deteccion se SSE en deportistas de Antioquia en 2012. En casos en los que se han instaurado los sintomas y persisten por un periodo superior a 2 semanas, se hace necesario iniciar medidas que permitan recuperar al deportista, la mas efectiva es el reposo y la suspension de la actividad competitiva y el entrenamiento; aun hay discusion en la literatura sobre el tipo de reposo, el cual puede ser absoluto, con suspension de todo tipo de actividad deportiva, o relativo, manteniendo actividades de ejercicio reportadas como “suaves”. Otras medidas tanto preventivas como de tratamiento utiles en SSE, son la adecuada periodizacion del entrenamiento, las medidas de higiene del sueno, el control de factores estresantes ambientales y sociales, el adecuado aporte calorico ajustado a las necesidades del momento del entrenamiento y la terapia sicologica encaminada a aumentar la seguridad, la autoconfianza, la autodeterminacion y disminuir la ansiedad y las reacciones al fracaso.

      "abstract": "Not all patients who experience hallucinations have a psychotic disorder. Many physical and psychiatric disorders can manifest with hallucinations, and some patients have > 1 disorder that could cause different types of hallucinations. To avoid providing unnecessary or ineffective treatments--and to ensure that patients receive proper care for nonpsychiatric conditions--it is important to accurately diagnose the disorder causing a patient's hallucinations. In this article we describe common features and psychiatnc and nonpsychiatric causes of auditory, visual, olfactory, gustatory, tactile, and somatic hallucinations. Awareness of typical presentations of hallucinations associated with specific disorders can help narrow the diagnosis and provide appropriate treatment. Auditory hallucinations Also known as paracusia, auditory hallucinations are perceptions of sounds without identifiable external stimuli. This type of hallucination has various causes (Table 1). (1) A frequent symptom of schizophrenia, auditory hallucinations can cause substantial distress and functional disability.

Simple (unformed) auditory hallucinations--referred to as tinnitus--can be caused by disease of the middle ear (otosclerosis) or inner ear. These unformed hallucinations consist of buzzing or tones of varying pitch and timbre. (1) Partial seizures may cause auditory hallucinations. Perceptions of music have been associated with partial seizures.

      "title": "Acute and transient psychotic disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract The heterogeneous group of acute and transient psychotic disorders are characterized by three typical features, listed below in descending order of priority: ♦ suddenness of onset (within 2 weeks or less); ♦ presence of typical syndromes with polymorphic (changing and variable) or schizophrenic symptoms; ♦ presence of associated acute stress (stressful events such as bereavement, job loss, psychological trauma, etc.). The onset of the disorder is manifested by an obvious change to an abnormal psychotic state. This is considered to be abrupt when it occurs within 48 h or less. Abrupt onset often indicates a better outcome. Full recovery occurs within 3 months and often in a shorter time (a few days or weeks). However, a small number of patients develop persistent and disabling states. The general (G) criteria for these acute disorders in DCR-10 (Diagnostic Criteria Research of ICD) are as follows. G1 There is acute onset of delusions, hallucinations, incomprehensible or incoherent speech, or any combination of these. The time interval between the first appearance of any psychotic symptoms and the presentation of the fully developed disorder should not exceed 2 weeks. G2 If transient states of perplexity, misidentification, or impairment of attention and concentration are present, they do not fulfil the criteria for organically caused clouding of consciousness as specified for F05, criterion A. G3 The disorder does not satisfy the symptomatic criteria for manic episode (F30), depressive episode (F32), or recurrent depressive disorder (F33). G4 There is insufficient evidence of recent psychoactive substance use to satisfy the criteria for intoxication (F1x.0), harmful use (F1x.1), dependence (F1x.2), or withdrawal states (F1x.3 and F1x.4). The continued moderate and largely unchanged use of alcohol or drugs in the amounts or with the frequency to which the individual is accustomed does not necessarily exclude the use of F23; this must be decided by clinical judgement and the requirements of the research project in question. G5 There must be no organic mental disorder (F00–F09) or serious metabolic disturbances affecting the central nervous system (this does not include childbirth). (This is the most commonly used exclusion clause.) A fifth character should be used to specify whether the acute onset of the disorder is associated with acute stress (occurring 2 weeks or less before evidence of first psychotic symptoms): ♦ F23.x0 without associated acute stress and ♦ F23.x1 with associated acute stress. For research purposes it is recommended that change of the disorder from a non-psychotic to a clearly psychotic state is further specified as either abrupt (onset within 48 h) or acute (onset in more than 48 h but less than 2 weeks). Six categories of acute psychoses are presented in ICD-10, and we shall discuss them in order.",

      "title": "Aberrant Hippocampal Neuroregenerative Plasticity in Schizophrenia: Reactive Neuroblastosis as a Possible Pathocellular Mechanism of Hallucination",
      "abstract": "Hallucination is a sensory perception that occurs in the absence of external stimuli during abnormal neurological disturbances and various mental diseases. Hallucination is recognized as a core psychotic symptom and is particularly more prevalent in individuals with schizophrenia. Strikingly, a significant number of subjects with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), Huntington’s disease (HD), and other neurological diseases like cerebral stroke and epileptic seizure also experience hallucination. While aberrant neurotransmission has been linked to the neuropathogenic events of schizophrenia, the precise cellular mechanism accounting for hallucinations remains obscure. Neurogenesis is a cellular process of producing new neurons from the neural stem cells (NSC)-derived neuroblasts in the brain that contribute to the regulation of pattern separation, mood, olfaction, learning, and memory in adulthood. Impaired neurogenesis in the hippocampus of the adult brain has been linked to stress, anxiety, depression, and dementia. Notably, many neurodegenerative disorders are characterized by the mitotic and functional activation of neuroblasts and cell cycle re-entry of mature neurons leading to a drastic alteration in neurogenic process, known as reactive neuroblastosis. Considering their neurophysiological properties, the abnormal integration of neuroblasts into the existing neural network or withdrawal of their connections can lead to abnormal synaptogenesis, and neurotransmission. Eventually, this would be expected to result in altered perception accounting for hallucination. Thus, this article emphasizes a hypothesis that aberrant neurogenic processes at the level of reactive neuroblastosis could be an underlying mechanism of hallucination in schizophrenia and other neurological diseases.",

      "title": "Narcolepsy, cataplexy, hypocretin and co-existing other health complaints: A review",
      "abstract": "The presence of cataplexy in people with narcolepsy has a well-documented tight association with very low or non-detectable levels of the central nervous system neuropeptide, hypocretin (also termed orexin) while levels of hypocretin are normal in people with narcolepsy without cataplexy. There is evidence to suggest that hypocretin may have an association with pain, migraines and headaches in people with narcolepsy. However, these studies have not compared findings across narcolepsy with and without cataplexy. Currently, there are no studies published to determine whether pain, migraines and headaches are just common symptoms experienced by all people with narcolepsy or whether the presence of the cataplexy symptom (and thus assumed low levels of hypocretin) exacerbates these symptoms. Also, it is unclear whether general health and wellbeing (including psychological wellbeing) is similarly affected by hypocretin levels, or may be confounded by different levels of other health symptoms, such as pain. This review poses a number of research questions that need to be explored about whether the presence or absence of cataplexy is differentially associated with different types, severity and location of chronic pain; frequency, location and types of migraines and headaches; and general health and wellbeing among people with narcolepsy. A greater understanding of the role of hypocretin in these health complaints could aid in the development of more appropriate treatments for pain, migraines and headaches amongst people with and without narcolepsy.",

      "title": "Where do we go in occupational neuroepidemiology?",
      "abstract": "Early knowledge about the neurotoxic effects of occupational exposures appeared through clinical observations. The observed effects were more or less acute and concerned exposure to metals such as lead and mercury or solvents like carbon disulfide and trichloroethylene. With time, however, also more chronic and clinically less obvious effects of neurotoxic agents have been assessed through modern examination methods and systematic studies of larger groups. Still, the interpretation of the findings has been controversial and debated, such as the chronic effects of solvent exposure (1). The difficulties met in interpreting chronic neurotoxic effects depend on both the diversity and vagueness of symptoms and signs and the associated problem of defining a proper disease entity for conclusive epidemiologic studies. For example, in solvent exposure, the chronic effects might include memory and concentration problems, tiredness, lack of initiative, affect lability, irritability, and sometimes dizziness, headache, alcohol intolerance, and reduced libido. Neurophysiological methods have also revealed various functional disturbances, again difficult to condense into any single disease entity. Similarly, a variety of neurobehavioral effects also seems to occur due to other occupational exposures, such as moderate lead exposure or welding with some exposure to aluminum, lead, and manganese or exposure to pesticides. Again there are also neurophysiological or neurological signs, among others, polyneuropathy, tremor, and disturbance of equilibrium, in individuals exposed to organochlorine, organophosphorus and other insecticides. In view of the epidemiologic problems involved in defining a disease entity out of the many types of neurobehavioral effects referred to, it has also become natural to consider some clinically, more or less well-defined neuropsychiatric disorders in relation to occupational exposures. Since the 1970s, several studies have especially focused on solvent exposure and the psychoorganic syndrome, when of disabling severity. More recently also Alzheimer's dementia, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and related conditions have attracted interest in occupational epidemiology. Regarding solvent exposure and the psychoorganic syndrome (or toxic chronic encephalopathy in clinical occupational medicine, when exposure is taken into diagnostic account), the problem of defining a proper disease entity was apparent and it first led to considering en bloc the diagnoses of encephalopathia, dementia, and cerebral atrophy, but also neurosis, neurasthenia, and nervositas were included as not necessarily distinct from each other in medical practice (2). Recently, more specific disease entities, such as organic dementia and cerebral atrophy, have also been associated with solvent exposure (3). The findings have not been totally consistent, however, as no excess of \"presenile dementia\" appeared in a large-scale case-referent study in the United States with as many as 3565 cases of various neuropsychiatric disorders and 83 245 hospital referents (4). However, in comparison with bricklayers, there was about a 45% excess of disabling neuropsychiatric disorders among white male painters, except spray painters. Occupational exposures also seem to play a role for disorders more specific than the psychoorganic syndrome. Hence, in 1982, an association between multiple sclerosis and solvent exposure from glues was first indicated in the Italian shoe industry (5). This relationship has been considerably strengthened by further studies in Scandinavia (6--8) and elsewhere, so that 13 studies with some information on solvent exposure could be considered in a review (9). Ten of these studies provided enough data for inclusion in a meta-analysis, showing about a twofold risk for multiple sclerosis among individuals with solvent exposure. Some studies also associate multiple sclerosis with radiological work, welding, and work with phenoxy herbicides (6--7). Parkinson's disease seems to be more common in rural areas (10), especially at younger ages (11). More interestingly, a study from Calgary, Canada, showed a threefold risk for herbicide exposure (12). All the case persons who recalled specific exposures reported exposure to phenoxy herbicides or thiocarbamates. One of them recalled exposure to paraquat, which is chemically similar to MPTP (N-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine), an inducer of a Parkinson-like syndrome. Paraquat workers have not yet been found to suffer from such a syndrome, however (13). Case-referent studies from Canada, China, Spain, and Sweden have indicated a relation with exposure to unspecified industrial chemicals, pesticides, and metals, especially manganese, iron and aluminum (14). In a study from the United States, an increased risk of motor neuron disease (encompassing amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, progressive bulbar palsy and progressive muscular atrophy) appeared in connection with welding and soldering (15). Welding also appeared as a risk factor, as did electricity work, and also work with impregnating agents in a Swedish study (16). Hereditability for neurodegenerative and thyroid disease, combined with solvent exposure and male gender, showed a risk as high as 15.6. Other studies also indicate that exposure to lead and solvents could be of importance (17--20). For Alzheimer's disease, no clear indication of any occupational risk appeared in a meta-analysis of 11 case-referent studies (21), but more recently an increased risk was connected with blue-collar work (22). Another new study, which included also the oldest ages, indicated that solvent exposure could be a rather strong risk factor (33). The recent suggestion that Alzheimer's disease might be related to exposure to electromagnetic fields was perhaps even more surprising (44). Both these studies are likely to stimulate interest in several new investigations along the indicated lines. Hence, in view of the current perspectives in occupational neuroepidemiology, as briefly outlined, there seems to be a reason for conducting additional work-related studies of different, hitherto more or less neglected, neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. It is not unlikely that there are some contributing effects from various occupational exposures, in the same manner as we have seen for many cancer types. In addition, as in etiologic cancer research, new clues suggesting ultimate causes or triggering mechanisms behind some of the serious neurological disorders may be obtained from occupational epidemiology.",

      "title": "Syncope And Related Paroxysmal Spells",
      "abstract": "Paroxysmal spells are non-epileptic, paroxysmal events that may mimic epileptic seizures but are not associated with rhythmic discharges of cortical neurons typical of seizures. They clinically manifest as a transient loss of consciousness, often occurring suddenly, with or without a prodrome. Paroxysmal spells can be caused by psychological disorders such as substance abuse and psychiatric disease or physiological events such as hypoglycemia, traumatic brain injury, and syncope. Psychological Conditions Data suggest that men with psychiatric disease have an increased incidence of syncope or paroxysmal events of unknown etiology. This data should lead clinicians to consider screening for psychiatric disorders in patients with transient loss of consciousness they cannot identify with a clear etiology.Among patients with a history of substance use disorder, 45% have been found to have unexplained syncope. This suggests that prior and current substance use is also associated with increased incidence of transient loss of consciousness of unknown etiology. Patients evaluated in the emergency department or even hospitalized with syncope of unknown etiology may benefit from toxicology screening and possible detoxification referral. Hypoglycemia Hypoglycemia is defined as low blood sugar with associated symptoms. In patients without diabetes mellitus, this is usually manifested at glucose levels below 50 mg/dl. To diagnose hypoglycemia, symptoms and blood sugar must improve with exogenous glucose. Hypoglycemia can affect the central nervous system, leading to lightheadedness, nausea, flashes of light, focal neurological deficits, transient loss of consciousness, and seizure. It is, therefore, paramount that patients with any paroxysmal spell or syncope receive a fingerstick glucose. Traumatic Brain Injury Traumatic brain injury is an intracranial impairment, often due to external forces. These forces may include blunt or penetrating trauma to the head, causing acceleration/deceleration injury to the cerebral cortex. Intracerebral bleeding, lacerations, and diffuse axonal injuries may result. Injuries, such as an epidural hematoma, may cause a brief state of loss of consciousness, with rapid return of, usually, altered consciousness. Other injuries, such as large subdural hematoma or diffuse axonal injury may cause worsening mentation and coma over hours to days. This is a result of increased intracranial pressure, leading to decreased cerebral perfusion pressure, and finally, neuronal ischemia. Diagnosis is by clinical history and CT imaging, although MRI may be more specific for secondary trauma. Management is to reduce intracranial pressure and edema. Syncope As most paroxysmal events are syncopal, the remainder of this discussion will focus primarily on syncope. Physiologically, syncope is a transient loss of consciousness as a result of cerebral hypoperfusion. As such, syncope varies from other etiologies of loss of consciousness in that it does not include head trauma or a post-ictal state. Syncope instead results in complete and rapid resolution of mental status. It may have myoclonic jerking, but no generalized tonic-clonic movement. Rather than a disease, syncope is a symptom of an underlying pathology ranging from benign to life-threatening. Patients are often divided into low-risk and high-risk groups. The etiology, epidemiology, evaluation, treatment, and management of these patients vary greatly. In the United States, hospitalization costs for syncope are estimated to be $5300 per admission and more than $2 billion annually. These costs are higher than those of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma combined. As extensive workups can be costly, time-consuming, and often unnecessary, a growing cadre of management tools has been devised to evaluate patients with syncope. These tools are tailored to determining the etiology of the syncopal event and treating dangerous, high-risk, syncope patients.",

      "title": "Psicoestimulantes en la infancia: ¿Medicalización o mejoramiento?",
      "abstract": "En los ultimos anos ha aumentado el numero de ninos en tratamiento con psicoestimulantes por trastorno de deficit de atencion e hiperactividad (TDAH). Dicho aumento ha ido acompanado de un uso no medico en adultos, bien por motivos recreacionales o con la finalidad de aumentar el rendimiento, academico o profesional. ?Tienen estas situaciones alguna relacion? En la infancia se utilizan los psicoestimulantes para tratar una enfermedad, con lo que en sentido estricto se utilizan exclusivamente como terapia. Pero al haberse relajado la interpretacion de los criterios diagnosticos del TDAH se plantea una situacion diferente, de medicalizacion (proceso por el cual queda bajo el control medico una situacion previamente vivida como fuera de ese ambito), mas que de mejoramiento (uso de un farmaco o tecnologia para mejorar una actividad de un sujeto sano). El aumento del uso de psicoestimulantes en la infancia seria un caso de medicalizacion. Este uso cada vez mas frecuente en la infancia tendria un efecto normalizador, de uso cotidiano. En la adolescencia y edad adulta, con dificultad para mantener o establecer el diagnostico de TDAH, se podria usar con criterios diferentes, de automedicacion con la finalidad de mejoramiento. Se analiza si el concepto de �enfermedad� que utilicemos puede llevar a un mayor o menor uso de psicofarmacos en la infancia, y si podria influir tambien en la edad adulta.",

Both often display hallucinations, delusions, loss of capacity to test reality, implausible thoughts and implausible thought connections, loss of volitional control over onset or termination of an episode, etc. Because of these similarities, it has been suggested that the same mechanisms may underlie both states. Hughlings Jackson expressed this notion in his famous dictum, \"Find out about dreams and you will find out about insanity.\"1(p269) In the past 15 years, empirical data about dreaming has increased enormously because of the discovery by Aserinsky, Kleitman, and Dement of reliable physiological indices of dreaming.<sup>2-4</sup>It is now well established that dreaming, and particularly that kind of dreaming which in its bizarreness and visual qualities most resembles florid psychosis,<sup>5-7</sup>takes place during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep; REM sleep is an inexorable",

      "abstract": "The construct of major depressive disorder makes no etiological assumptions about populations with diverse symptom clusters. “Depressed mood” and “loss of interest or pleasure in nearly all activities” are core features of a major depressive episode, though a strong case can be made to pay increasing attention to symptoms of fatigue, sleep disturbance, anxiety, and neurocognitive and sexual dysfunction in the diagnosis and evaluation of treatment outcome. Mood, guilt, work, and interest, as well as psychic anxiety, are consistently identified across validated subscales of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale as prevalent and sensitive to change with existing treatments. A major limitation of these antidepressant therapies is their narrow spectrum of action. While the core “mood and interest” symptoms have been the main focus of attention, the associated symptoms listed above are often unaffected or exacerbated by current treatments. Careful clinical evaluation should address all of these dimensions, recognizing that improvement may occur sooner in some symptoms (eg, mood) compared with others (eg, sleep disturbance).",

      "abstract": "Serotonergic hallucinogens also referred to as psychedelics, are psychoactive substances that profoundly alter perception, mood, and cognitive processes. These substances, historically intertwined with religious and cultural rituals, offer profound effects that extend beyond mere hallucinations to profoundly altered states of consciousness. Notable compounds like Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin, potent in their action on serotonin receptors, play pivotal roles in influencing brain functions. Despite societal misconceptions that have overshadowed their potential, contemporary research increasingly recognizes their therapeutic value. These substances have shown promise in treating neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and anxiety, leveraging their influence on neuroplasticity. Furthermore, they exhibit therapeutic potential across various conditions, challenging conventional treatment methodologies. Compared to substances like alcohol, traditional psychedelics like LSD and psilocybin emerge as relatively safer substances. The modern revival of scientific interest in psychedelics necessitates a renewed perspective, viewing them not just as recreational entities but as potent therapeutic tools. Harnessing their actual value mandates rigorous scientific investigations and a receptive societal discourse. A re-evaluation of their classification following international criteria is necessary in light of this increasing understanding. Hallucinogens or psychedelic drugs, if used correctly, can potentially be potential treatments for mental illness, signalling a paradigm shift from traditional techniques. To dispel myths and use their therapeutic advantages, embracing this potential necessitates thorough scientific investigation together with an open societal discourse.",

      "title": "Affective symptoms and emerging psychotic disorder in adolescents",
      "abstract": "Depressive symptoms are frequently reported during the period preceding the onset of schizophrenia in adolescents when such symptoms can be mistaken for those of mood disorder. However, it is unclear which emotional symptoms should be considered predictive of schizophrenia onset. The types of emotional disturbances that may precede schizophrenic disorder were sought through a review of historical descriptive studies and seminal works using a phenomenological approach. Five main types of emotional disturbances have been found as prodromal symptoms of a schizophrenic disorder: (1) increased sensitivity to stress, (2) poor or incomplete expression of emotions, (3) reduced emotion sharing, (4) emotional detachment, and (5) disconnection between the perception and expression of emotions. Studies based on phenomenological views of schizophrenic disorders stressed the chronological sequence of these symptoms in the same person. For example, the term “delusional mood” (Wahnstimmung) coined to describe changes in the perceived atmosphere encompass mood disturbances from subtle emotional overreactivity to more severe symptoms that could evoke athymhormia. Analysis of recent studies among subjects at high-risk for psychotic transition showed that the presence of mood symptoms at a very early stage of the disorder is common. While these symptoms predict a lower level of general functioning, they were not associated with a higher risk of developing a schizophrenic disorder at follow-up.

Its diagnosis is purely clinical and rests on the sudden occurrence of retention amnesia associated with retrograde amnesia without disturbances in speech or other neurological deficits.

The cause of transient global amnesia is unknown, and the various hypotheses that have been put forward (e.g. epilepsy, transient ischaemia or migraine) have not been confirmed by clinical and epidemiological studies.

      "title": "Neonatal Seizures",
      "abstract": "Definitions and Epidemiology A seizure is a sudden, paroxysmal discharge of a population of neurons that causes a transient alteration in neurologic function. This alteration may involve abnormal motor activity, sensory symptoms, a change in the level of alertness, alteration in autonomic function, or any combination of these. When a seizure occurs in the neonatal period, several special considerations arise (Table 1). A seizure in a newborn almost always reflects significant nervous system pathology, and recognizing and treating seizures properly may prevent subsequent chronic neurologic impairment. It is important not to confuse seizures with epilepsy. A seizure is a single event and may be due to a transient abnormality that will not recur (eg, hypoglycemia). Epilepsy is the condition of unprovoked recurrent seizures. Many neonatal seizures are transient events that will not progress to epilepsy. Ictal refers to clinical (based on visual observation) or electrical (based on the electroencephalogram [EEG]) activity occurring during a seizure (Table 2). Seizures occur in about 0.2% to 1.4% of all newborns. However, the incidence is much higher among certain high-risk groups. About 20% of newborns whose birthweight is less than 2500 g have seizures, with a higher incidence among sicker preterm infants. Incidence also depends on etiology; as many as 50% of newborns who have severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) develop neonatal seizures.",

We report a 15-year-old male patient with cannabis abuse, who was in emergence agitation or excited delirium after gastro-endoscopic procedure with propofol and ketamine sedation. In this case midazolam was not adequate and haloperidol was administered in order to diminish severe agitation.

The prodromal symptoms of discomfort and the subsequent loss of consciousness occurred while the patient was in bed or got up to go to the toilet due to abdominal symptoms. The onset in supine position was misleading, since this is a well-known alarm symptom of a possible cardiac cause. The second patient had vasovagal syncope followed by a psychogenic pseudosyncope. This resulted in frequent loss of consciousness of long duration with typical and atypical triggers and uncommon syncopal signs, including eye closure.

      "abstract": "Benzodiazepines and medications acting on benzodiazepine receptors that do not have a benzodiazepine structure (z-drugs) have been viewed by some experts and regulatory bodies as having limited benefit and significant risks. Data presented in this article support the use of these medications as treatments of choice for acute situational anxiety, chronic anxiety disorders, insomnia, alcohol withdrawal syndromes, and catatonia. They may also be useful adjuncts in the treatment of anxious depression and mania, and for medically ill patients. Tolerance develops to sedation and possibly psychomotor impairment, but not to the anxiolytic effect of benzodiazepines. Sedation can impair cognitive function in some patients, but assertions that benzodiazepines increase the risk of dementia are not supported by recent data. Contrary to popular opinion, benzodiazepines are not frequently misused or conduits to misuse of other substances in patients without substance use disorders who are prescribed these medications for appropriate indications; most benzodiazepine misuse involves medications that are obtained from other people. Benzodiazepines are usually not lethal in overdose except when ingested with other substances, especially alcohol and opioids. Benzodiazepines comprise one of the few classes of psychotropic medication the mechanisms of action of which are clearly delineated, allowing for greater precision in their clinical use. These medications, therefore, belong in the therapeutic armamentarium of the knowledgeable clinician.",

      "abstract": "The utility of classical drugs used to treat psychiatric disorders (e.g., antidepressants, anxiolytics) is often limited by issues of lack of efficacy, delayed onset of action or side effects. Psychoactive substances have a long history of being used as tools to alter consciousness and as a gateway to approach the unknown and the divinities. These substances were initially obtained from plants and animals and more recently by chemical synthesis, and its consumption evolved toward a more recreational use, leading to drug abuse-related disorders, trafficking, and subsequent banning by the authorities. However, these substances, by modulation of certain neurochemical pathways, have been proven to have a beneficial effect on some psychiatric disorders. This evidence obtained under medically controlled conditions and often associated with psychotherapy, makes these substances an alternative to conventional medicines, to which in many cases the patient does not respond properly. Such disorders include post-traumatic stress disease and treatment-resistant depression, for which classical drugs such as MDMA, ketamine, psilocybin and LSD, among others, have already been clinically tested, reporting successful outcomes. The irruption of new psychoactive substances (NPS), especially during the last decade and despite their recreational and illicit uses, has enlarged the library of substances with potential utility on these disorders. In fact, many of them were synthetized with therapeutic purposes and were withdrawn for concrete reasons (e.g., adverse effects, improper pharmacological profile). In this review we focus on the basis, existing evidence and possible use of synthetic cathinones and psychedelics (specially tryptamines) for the treatment of mental illnesses and the properties that should be found in NPS to obtain new therapeutic compounds.",

      "title": "Serotonin syndrome following introduction of venlafaxine following withdrawal of phenelzine: implications for drug washout periods",
      "abstract": "We report here a case of serotonin syndrome (SS) following initiation of venlafaxine 2 weeks after withdrawal of a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), phenelzine, and also following repeated retrials of venlafaxine initiation. The case has clinically important implications regarding the period of time necessary for monoamine oxidase biosynthesis following use of an irreversible MAOI.\r\n\r\nSS is characterized by the presence of autonomic nervous system symptoms (such as hyperthermia, diaphoresis, mydriasis, nausea, shivering, hypertension, tachycardia, and diarrhoea), mental status changes (such as agitation, hypomania, and confusion), and neuromuscular abnormalities (such as myoclonus, incoordination, hyperreflexia, tremors, clonus, and muscle rigidity [Sternbach, 2003]). SS can be a life-threatening condition and occurs acutely due to markedly increased serotonin levels in brain, often following a coprescription or overdose of serotonergic drugs. These drugs can increase serotonin levels by inhibiting metabolism (such as MAOI), increasing formation (such as l-tryptophan), inhibiting reuptake (such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), or tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)), increase release (such as amphetamines) or increasing postsynaptic receptor sensitivity (such as lithium). Overdose with a SSRI alone results in mild SS in about 15% of people but does not usually lead to severe toxicity [Isbister et al. 2007]. The occurrence of the syndrome is highest with a combination of SSRIs and MAOIs, though it is also reported with other serotonergic drug combinations.\r\n\r\nSternbach described criteria to diagnose SS (Table 1) and highlighted the importance of identifying it since it is usually reversible following discontinuation of the offending drug(s), supportive treatment and addition of a serotonin antagonist (such as cyproheptadine or chlorpromazine) in more severe cases [Sternbach, 1991]. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 1.\r\n\r\nSternbach’s criteria [Modified after Sternbach 1991].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere have been previous case reports of patients who experienced an SS when a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) has been introduced after the traditionally recommended 2-week washout from an irreversible MAOI [Sternbach, 2003]. However, we have been unable to identify any instance in the literature where a patient has been rechallenged with a SRI (such as an SSRI, SNRI or a TCA) after a further period of washout following the occurrence of SS.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Multiple Disorders of Sleep and Wakefulness with excessive movement, sleepiness or insomnia are common, affecting most children at some period of life. Profoundly affect the quality of life and even put it at risk. The aim of this study was to analyze sleep disorders in childhood . Literature Review: A review was made on aspects of normal sleep ontogenesis and management of sleep disorders most prevalent in childhood. Were selected scientific articles in SciELO database, using the keywords sleep disorders and childhood. Second, the literature studied can classify the sleep disorders in four clinical groups: a) are those in which primary sleep disorder is the main or only symptom, eg, nightmares, night terrors, insomnia, hypersomnia, sleep paralysis and narcolepsy b) secondary sleep disorders is only one aspect of a complex clinical change, such as schizophrenia, depression or thyroid dysfunction c) parasomnias activities are not indicative of pathology when awake, but they are certainly not during sleep as sleepwalking, bedwetting, bruxism and nocturnal jactatio capitis d) clinical changes that can be influenced by sleep, but little influence, such as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. In pediatric clinic the most frequent parasomnias and changes primary sleep. The insomnia generally results from poor educational practice and / or emotional disturbances. Remember that children with obstructive sleep disorders have worse results in the test of learning and memory. Conclusion: Sleep disturbances are very frequent complaints in pediatric outpatient clinics, and a correct diagnosis is essential for the establishment of appropriate therapy. In most cases, clinical history is sufficient for the diagnosis and assuring parents the mercy of the problem, and the best treatment.",

      "title": "Insight across mental disorders: A multifaceted metacognitive phenomenon",
      "abstract": "There is now general agreement that lack of insight is not merely a fundamental aspect of delusions and hallucinations, or just a symptom of psychotic disorders but rather a multi-dimensional construct. Several different components of insight have been proposed and empirically examined during the last three decades, such as the ability to recognize that one has a mental illness, the capacity to relabel unusual mental events as pathological, the specific attribution of one's symptoms to having a mental illness, awareness of illness' consequences, and compliance with treatment.1 Insight impairment is an important prognostic factor in schizophrenia, impacting negatively on medication adherence, treatment outcome, and social functioning.2 Although largely investigated in schizophrenia and other psychoses, insight impairments are observed in many, if not all, mental disorders. Varying levels of awareness of mental illness and/or of specific symptoms are expected in patients with bipolar disorders, Alzheimer disease and other neurocognitive disorders, obsessive-compulsive (OCD) and related disorders.1,3 While in DSM-5 an \"insight\" specifier was incorporated for OCD, body dysmorphic and hoarding disorder, patients' insight has been found ranging from good to absent in other disorders, such as depressive disorders,4 eating disorders,5 and even specific6 and social7 phobias. Moreover, impaired insight is a common reason that many people with clinical depression or anxiety disorders never seek appropriate treatment and most of the people with addictions and personality disorders fail to recognize and address their problems even when the consequences are devastating: personal suffering, broken relationships, and physical health problems. Depending on the disorder and reflecting different conceptual approaches, many different terms are used to describe lack of insight, such as poor self-awareness, denial, anosognosia (mainly in neurological deficits, e.g. hemiplegia), ego-syntonic symptoms, or even self-deception. At any rate, as an aspect of self-knowledge, insight has psychological (defense mechanisms, coping strategies), social and cultural facets. On the other hand, the attitudes and behaviours towards one's illness are products of inference processes and therefore can be influenced by cognitive dysfunctions. Previous research in schizophrenia showed correlations between neurocognitive functions and insight measures but the strength of this association is rather weak.8 Social cognition may be a crucial cognitive determinant of impaired insight in schizophrenia. The correct attitude toward morbid change in oneself relies on the capacity to reflect upon self from the perspective of the other (i.e., \"to see ourselves as others see us\"). This capacity is clearly linked to the ability to understand mental states (e.g., beliefs, knowledge, and intentions) of others, that is, theory of mind or mentalizing. Recent research has shown that mentalizing deficits may substantially contribute to insight impairment in schizophrenia.9 This effect could be further examined in the broader context of patient's failures in metacognition, i.e. the general ability to think about thinking, and their relationships with insight impairment in schizophrenia. Mentalizing and introspection are closely related developmentally and it is yet unclear which one is the primary ability: we are able to understand others and then apply this understanding to ourselves or we are able to reflect on ourselves and then apply this reflection to others. A recent line of research in schizophrenia is based on the distinction introduced by Beck et al10 between clinical insight (i.e., awareness of illness) and cognitive insight, which describes a metacognitive ability, specifically patients' flexibility towards their beliefs, judgements and experiences. The self-report Beck Cognitive Insight Scale (BCIS) examines two subcomponents: self-certainty, assessing overconfidence about being right (e.g. \"I know better than anyone else what mycomponents: self-certainty, assessing overconfidence about being right (e.g. \"I know better than anyone else what my problems are\"), and self-reflectiveness, assessing willingness to accept external feedback and recognition of dysfunctionalreasoning style (e.g. \"Some of the ideas I was certain were true turned out to be false\"). Cognitive insight in thisform describes two related but distinct aspects of metacognition in patients with psychosis, differentially associated withclinical insight, symptoms, treatment outcomes, and functioning.11 Another method for assessment of similar metacognitiveskills also used in schizophrenia is a scale (Metacognition Assessment Scale - Abbreviated, MAS-A) that is administeredthrough a specific interview and examines the capacities of self-reflectivity, understanding of the other individuals'mental states, and using metacognitive knowledge to respond to psychosocial challenges. Lysaker and colleaguesfound recently that metacognitive deficits assessed with MAS-A predict impaired insight in schizophrenia independentof symptoms.12 It is questionable whether BCIS and other methods used so far to assess self-reflection in psychoses arevalid and useful for patients with non-psychotic disorders.11 However, the metacognitive conceptualization of insightmight contribute to a new research framework for insight impairments across mental disorders. According to this approach, poor insight is in part a failure of self-reflection, i.e. the process by which we synthesizeand comprehend ideas about ourselves. This may be due to general deficits in metacognitive abilities (self-reflectivity,mentalizing) or may represent limited, domain-specific, or transient dysfunctions in metacognitive processes. Insight hasto be thought of as a relational concept, that is insight into something: insight into illness, current syndrome, specificsymptoms, pathological personality traits, social difficulties etc.1,3 In an integrated model of insight across mental disorders,aspects of metacognition interacting with multiple other (clinical, neurocognitive, emotional, and social) factorsdetermine patient's ability to correctly process information into self-awareness. The identification of these factors andtheir interactions may be a fruitful field in the research of insight.",

      "abstract": "Delusions, hallucinations, and other psychotic symptoms can accompany a number of conditions in late life. These symptoms may be more common than previously thought; Swedish investigators found that in a sample of 85-year-old people, the prevalence of psychotic symptoms was 10.1%, with 6.9% experiencing hallucinations, 5.5% having delusions, and 6.9% experiencing paranoid ideation (Ostling and Skoog 2002). Conditions that cause acute psychotic symptoms that tend to resolve when the underlying condition is treated are discussed elsewhere in this volume (e.g., delirium is discussed in Chapter 7, \"Delirium,\" and drug-induced psychosis is discussed in Chapter 20, \"Psychopharmacology\"). In this chapter, we review the epidemiology, presentation, and treatment of chronic late-life psychotic disorders that are not secondary to a mood disorder or a general medical condition other than a neurocognitive disorder. We discuss early-onset schizophrenia, late-onset schizophrenia, very-late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis (with onset after age 60), delusional disorder, and psychosis related to a major neurocognitive disorder such as Alzheimer's disease (AD).",

      "title": "Syncope in Athletes of Cardiac Origin",
      "abstract": "Personal History: Have You Ever Nearly Lost or Actualy Lost Consciousness? The History To determine the importance of a positive answer to this question, the following questions should be asked: Did the syncopal event occur during or immediately after exercise; if the latter, was the patient standing still or moving around? Prior to the syncopal event, were there any prodromal symptoms such as the following: chest pain, palpitations, visual changes, wheezing/shortness of breath, nausea, or itching? After the syncopal event, what was the patient’s postevent clinical status? Did they wake quickly, or was there a prolonged period of unresponsiveness? Was there any observed seizure activity or loss of urine, stool, or tongue bite marks? Were there vital signs recorded on site, particularly the immediate postsyncope measurements? What medications and supplements were being utilized prior to the event? Is there a prior personal or family history of syncope or of sudden cardiac arrest/death? The evaluating physician’s first priority is to use the clinical history to distinguish between true syncope involving a loss of consciousness with presumed hemodynamic compromise and exercise-associated collapse associated with exhaustive effort or postexercise hypotension. In true syncope from hemodynamic causes, the athlete typically recovers quickly with restoration of arterial pressure, unless resuscitation is required. After collapse associated with an exhaustive effort, however, athletes usually will have prolonged periods of “being out of it,” even in the supine position with normal heart rate and BP. This picture is in contrast to patients with syncope due to heat stress who are universally hypotensive and tachycardic. Athletes who are impaired, seeming “unconscious,” but able to assist in their own evacuation are unlikely to be in the throes of a life-threatening arrhythmia, although other metabolic or catastrophic abnormalities are possible (e.g., hyponatremia, exertional heat stroke). The postevent state provides important clues such as seizure activity, incontinence, and immediate vital signs (including body temperature). It must be emphasized however, that a seizure-like activity can be the result of reduced cerebral perfusion and therefore does not always imply epilepsy or neurologic problems. Reports from witnesses can be invaluable. Too often, syncope is assumed to be neurologic and the cardiac evaluation is not done, resulting in fatal outcomes. The second critical distinction is whether the event occurred during or immediately after exercise. Orthostatic hypotension occurring after exercise, usually associated with sudden cessation of activity, is much less ominous than the sudden loss of consciousness that occurs during exercise, which suggests cardiac arrhythmia with loss of blood flow to the brain. Syncope prompted by an abrupt loud noise such as a starting gun or immersion in cold water may provide a clinical clue to prolonged QT syndrome (LQTS). The third component of the history that provides clinical clues is a detailed assessment of events prior to the collapse. Prodromal symptoms such as palpitations (suggesting arrhythmia), chest pain (ischemia, aortic dissection), nausea (ischemia, high levels of vagal activity, or hyponatremia), wheezing, and pruritus (anaphylaxis) are significant, along with precipitating events like “only during exercise.” It is important to identify whether syncope occurs in the upright position (orthostatic hypotension) alone or also when sitting or supine (arrhythmia or nonhemodynamic cause). The fourth component of the evaluation requires assessment of the medication and supplement history. A comprehensive medication list, including over-the-counter medications and ergogenic aids is necessary; the practice of high-risk behaviors, such as recreational drug use should be carefully investigated. Finally, a personal and family history of sudden death is critical and, if present, may identify very high-risk subgroups with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), LQTS, or right ventricular cardiomyopathy. Delineating a family tree will give a complete snapshot of the family history. The Physical Examination Vital signs (including orthostatic measurements) should be included. Blood pressure (BP) should be measured in both arms and legs as well as after 5 min of moving to a standing position. Special Tests/Referral The three tests that are core to the diagnostic evaluation of the athlete with syncope include the electrocardiogram (ECG), the echocardiogram, and the exercise stress test. Echocardiography should precede the exercise test, allowing the assessment of ventricular size and function, pulmonary pressures, and valve function/integrity. Rather than a standard Bruce protocol, a maximal symptom-limited exercise test should be used to reproduce the conditions that provoked the syncopal event. For example, a stuttering start-stop test for a basketball or soccer player or a prolonged high-intensity race pace test for a runner. The exercise ECG also should be examined for appropriate shortening of the QT interval. Further testing should be ordered only as indicated and in consultation with the appropriate specialist. A complete review of all the advanced diagnostic tests is beyond the focus of this article. Tilt table testing should not be used in the syncope evaluation because of the high rate of false positive tests due to the steep Starling curve in athletes. The clinician is additionally reminded that not all syncope is cardiogenic. Athletes whose history suggests seizure activity may require an electroencephalogram and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain to exclude a structural lesion, and seizures can be related to hyponatremia or heat stroke. Hematologic and metabolic abnormalities require testing as indicated, e.g., hypoglycemia in those with diabetes, athletes with eating disorders, or patients on beta-blockers. CASE EXAMPLES Case 1: Cross-Country Runner with Collapse at the Finish Line A 17-year-old female track star was competing in the district championships in the 5,000 m. She was having an excellent race and was part of the final pack that was in contention for a medal. Just after crossing the finish line (in 17 min 55 s), she collapsed to the ground and, according to bystanders, remained “unconscious” for about an hour. ECG, echocardiogram, and Holter monitor testing results were normal, although she did not faint during the period of recording. An athlete-specific exercise test was performed on a large treadmill at 10 mph; after 10 min, the patient started to cry and then slumped in the safety harness. At the moment of fainting, her rhythm was normal, pulse was 185 bpm, and BP was 140/70. The final impression was exercise-associated collapse, and the recommendation was better training and pacing to match demands of her sport. Key Point: History pointed away from life-threatening arrhythmia; athlete-specific exercise testing reproduced the problem during direct electrical and hemodynamic monitoring, allowing an accurate diagnosis. Case 2: Basketball Player with Collapse on the Free Throw Line A 21-year-old male college basketball star led a 12-point run, mostly by a series of impressive fast breaks, in the middle of the first half of an early round of the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament. After the last jam, he was fouled and walked to the foul line. While standing waiting to shoot, he slumped to the ground. Witnesses observed generalized seizure activity. ECG showed LVH and unusual T waves in the right precordial leads, but his echocardiogram result was normal and short-term Holter monitoring did not identify any arrhythmias, although no symptoms occurred during the monitoring period. A stuttering exercise test was performed at high speed (15 mph) followed by sudden stops. After the fifth repeat, while standing quietly, there was a sudden drop in pulse to 45 bpm, BP was 60/40, and the patient fainted on the treadmill. The final diagnosis was postexercise hypotension (neurally mediated syncope). The recommendation was behavioral modification (avoid standing still if possible, learn leg crossing/butt clenching and toe bouncing maneuvers, stay well hydrated, and wear compression socks). Key Point: Standing still after intense exercise can lead to hypotension due to loss of the muscle pump and lead to neurally mediated syncope with bradycardia and hypotension. Athlete-specific exercise testing elicited the problem and led to simple, effective, nonpharmacologic therapy. Case 3: Football Player with Collapse while Running out for a Pass A 19-year-old male wide receiver for a junior college football team was running a crossing pattern during practice when witnesses observed him to weave, stumble, and fall to the ground. The trainer arrived at the scene to find him alert and oriented. His BP was 135/80; pulse was 110 bpm and regular. Physical examination result was normal; however, ECG results showed septal Q waves, LVH, and deep T wave inversions. Echocardiogram results showed a septal thickness of 1.8 cm, although without systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve. Holter monitoring revealed multiple runs of NSVT, and cardiac MRI showed multiple areas of delayed enhancement. The diagnosis was HCM; he was held from competition, and family members were screened for HCM. Key Point: Syncope during exercise is very concerning for an arrhythmia and underlying structural heart disease. Case 4: Lacrosse Player with Syncope during Exercise A lacrosse player had syncope while running wind sprints. Careful history examination documented that the syncope occurred during a sprint and not between sprints. ECG results showed nonspecific ECG changes, but the echocardiogram result was normal. The exercise test result was normal; cardiac MRI was performed and showed patchy areas of delayed enhancement indicating potential myocarditis. An electrophysiology (EP) study induced atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) but no ventricular arrhythmias. A 24-h Holter monitor showed no arrhythmias. The athlete had a major game coming up, and there was pressure to allow him to play. The patient had ablation of the AVNRT and was allowed to return to sports. He died in practice the following week. Key Point: The worrisome history plus noncoronary distribution of delayed enhancement on MRI are concerning for myocarditis. The conservative approach would have been to treat with a beta-blocker and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, hold out of sports for at least 3 to 6 months, perhaps implant an implantable loop recorder so that a specific diagnosis could be made if another episode of syncope occurred, and then repeat the MRI looking for resolution of delayed enhancement. Pressure to play (athlete, coach, and parent) can influence medical decision making and steer the decision away from the athlete’s best interest. Case 5: A 23-year-old male second-year medical student completed a maximal-effort Wingate test as part of a research project; prior V˙O2max testing demonstrated a maximum of 55 mL·kg−1·min−1. Immediately after the 30-s test, the student was extremely nauseous and rapidly exited the bike to move to a trash can to vomit; after two short wobbly steps, he collapsed to the ground. He was attended to immediately by the exercise staff in attendance; he had an estimated loss of consciousness for less than 30 s and had a first set of vital signs of heart rate of 140 bpm and BP of 110/60. There was no observed seizure activity and no prior complaint of chest pain. A subsequent evaluation in the sports medicine clinic demonstrated normal clinical examination results with no history of syncope; ECG results demonstrated early repolarization variation in the precordial leads. As the syncopal event occurred immediately after exercise, a treadmill stress test and echocardiogram were performed; the student completed 17 min of Bruce protocol and had a normal echocardiogram results. The diagnosis was postexertional syncope secondary to orthostatic hypotension. Key Point: Syncope during or immediately after exercise is always concerning and warrants conscientious examination to rule out structural cardiovascular disease. Intense anaerobic exercise, which can be seen in maximal efforts like the Wingate test or weightlifting, can precipitate syncope through orthostatic hypotension and a central effect of hypocapnia leading to, or aggravating, cerebral hypoperfusion. The history of the event provides not only insight into the diagnosis but also important opportunities for prudent recommendations for prevention.",

      "abstract": "The affective disorders include a variety of conditions characterised by mood changes unrelated to life events, i.e. they are not reactive. There is major depression, sometimes referred to as psychotic or endogenous depression, mania and bipolar or manic depression. Any extreme of mood may be associated with psychosis in which thinking may become irrational and delusional. Since drug therapy should be based upon symptomatology and not on diagnosis this should not cause problems. However, it has sometimes been rather difficult to differentiate clearly manic depression from schizophrenia and the boundaries may merge. In typical cases the distinction is clear. There may also be a tendency for the nature of the illness to change over the years and the diagnosis may change accordingly. Until the major mental illnesses can be characterised completely in terms of specific disorders in structure or function, diagnosis will need to remain linked to symptoms and treatment. A recent promising beginning is the association of a genetic abnormality with the illness.",

      "abstract": "We here review Babylonian descriptions of neurological and psychiatric disorders, including epilepsy, stroke, psychoses, obsessive compulsive disorder, phobias, psychopathic behaviour, depression and anxiety. Most of these accounts date from the first Babylonian dynasty of the first half of the second millennium BC, within a millennium and a half of the origin of writing. The Babylonians were remarkably acute and objective observers of medical disorders and human behaviour. Their detailed descriptions are surprisingly similar to modern 19th and 20th century AD textbook accounts, with the exception of subjective thoughts and feelings which are more modern fields of enquiry. They had no knowledge of brain or psychological function. Some neuropsychiatric disorders, e.g. stroke or facial palsy, had a physical basis requiring the attention of a physician or asû, using a plant and mineral based pharmacology; some disorders such as epilepsy, psychoses, depression and anxiety were regarded as supernatural due to evil demons or spirits, or the anger of personal gods, and thus required the intervention of the priest or ašipu; other disorders such as obsessive compulsive disorder and psychopathic behaviour were regarded as a mystery. The Babylonians were the first to describe the clinical foundations of neurology and psychiatry. We discuss these accounts in relation to subsequent and more modern clinical descriptions.",

Chronic hyperventilation, however, with vague and multiple symptomatology due to respiratory alkalosis and increased breathing work, is often overlooked or misinterpreted, though it is a very common disorder of the general patient population. Chronic HV is frequently associated with emotional disturbances such as anxiety, panic and depression, or with psychosomatic disorders such as irritable bowel, effort syndrome and chronic pain. The diagnosis of chronic HV relies primarily on taking of a thorough history and is confirmed by an HV provocation test and arterial or cutaneous measurements of pCO2. Therapeutic measurements include psychotherapy, psychoactive drugs (antidepressants and benzodiazepines), beta-blockers and modification of abnormal breathing patterns.",

In relation to disease, VH are experienced in a range of psychiatric and neurological conditions, as well as in non-CNS or brain disorders. Epilepsy, Parkinson's disease (PD) and Lewy body dementia (LBD), together with schizophrenia, are prominent neurological or psychiatric conditions in which VH are common.

      "abstract": "Generalized convulsive status epilepticus (GCSE) is the most common type of status epilepticus and carries the greatest risk of morbidity and mortality (1). It is a neurologic emergency requiring immediate evaluation and treatment. The traditional definition of GCSE requires continuous, repetitive seizure activity for at least 30 min, or two or more discrete seizures within a 30-min period without recovery of consciousness between attacks. The temporal marker of 30 min is arbitrary and not based on physiologic or clinical data (2). Several epileptologists have proposed a \"mechanistic\" definition of GCSE: Most seizures stop spontaneously in 1 or 2 min; therefore, longer seizures generally reflect a problem with the usual mechanisms of seizure termination. The \"mechanistic\" definition refers to any seizure that will not terminate spontaneously, consisting of convulsive movements and loss of consciousness (3,4). This definition, however, is not practical for clinical and research purposes because there is presently no clear way to distinguish a seizure that will terminate on its own from one that will not. An \"operational\" definition of GCSE must still be described in terms of time (4).",

Some symptoms of the disease, such as auditory hallucinations and delusions, can be ameliorated with drug treatment, whereas other symptoms, such as social withdrawal and cognitive decline, remain uncontrolled. It is possible that these latter symptoms that are often termed ''negative symptoms'' are the result of anatomical and neurochemical abnormalities, whereas those symptoms of the disease such as auditory hallucinations that are termed ''positive symptoms'' may be a result of only neurochemical disorders. The drugs used to treat schizophrenia are designated neuroleptics. The term neuroleptic was chosen to emphasize the similarity of pharmacological profiles of drugs with entirely different chemical structures. Especially prominent features of the effects of neuroleptics include the following: a state of affective indifference; a decrease in locomotor activity; a decrease in excitation, agitation, and aggressiveness; and an antipsychotic action in patients with acute as well as chronic psychoses.",

The behavior includes movements, emotional, perceptual or dreaming experience, frequently containing manifestations of autonomic nervous system. Parasomnias are devided into primary (ocurring etiher in NREM or REM sleep) and secondary (following organic system disease manifested during sleep). Primary parasomnias are further devided into those that appear during NREM, REM or states of consciousnes that do not respect boundaries between wake and sleep. Parasomnias represent an example of \"dissocitaion of sleep stages\" with the overlaping of wakefulness and NREM sleep (confusional arousals, somnambulism and night terrors) or wake and REM sleep (REM sleep behavior disorder parasomnia). NREM parasomnias are a significant clinical problem that appears with functional reorganization of the brain as it transits throuh different states of consciousness. Aside from the above dissociation there are other physiological phenomena that render behavior more complex during sleep such as 1) activation of locomotor centers during sleep, 2) sleep intertia (confusion and desorientation during transition from sleep to wakefulness) and 3) instability of sleep stages (rapid oscilation(s) between seleep and wake).",

      "title": "Epilepsy: Treatment Options.",
      "abstract": "The occurrence of a single seizure does not always require initiation of antiepileptic drugs. Risk of recurrent seizures should guide their use. In adults, key risk factors for recurrence are two unprovoked seizures occurring more than 24 hours apart, epileptiform abnormalities on electroencephalography, abnormal brain imaging, nocturnal seizures, or an epileptic syndrome associated with seizures. In children, key risk factors are abnormal electroencephalography results, an epileptic syndrome associated with seizures, severe head trauma, and cerebral palsy. The risk of adverse effects from antiepileptic drugs is considerable and includes potential cognitive and behavioral effects. In the absence of risk factors, and because many patients do not experience recurrence of a seizure, physicians should consider delaying use of antiepileptic drugs until a second seizure occurs. Delaying therapy until a second seizure does not affect one- to two-year remission rates. Treatment should begin with monotherapy. The appropriate choice of medication varies depending on seizure type. Routine monitoring of drug levels is not correlated with reduction in adverse effects or improvement in effectiveness and is not recommended. When patients have been seizure free for two to five years, discontinuation of antiepileptic drugs may be considered. For patients with seizures that are not controlled with these agents, alternative treatments include surgical resection of the seizure focus, ketogenic diets, vagus nerve stimulators, and implantable brain neurostimulators. Patients who have had a recent seizure within the past three months or whose seizures are poorly controlled should refrain from driving and certain high-risk physical activities. Patients planning for pregnancy should know that antiepileptic drugs are possibly teratogenic.",

Primary causes are directly attributable to the event itself and thus vary by event type, e.g., drowning in tropical storms and floods, direct trauma in earthquakes and tornados. Secondary causes vary less by event type as they are driven by common effects: loss of electrical power and shelter, transportation disruption, loss of healthcare access, attempted repair/restoration, and other disruption of daily routine. Primary and particularly secondary causes may be difficult to attribute, typically leading to undercounting. Secondary causes of death, illness, and injury can be divided into four broad categories: pre-existing medical conditions, environmental degradation or magnified exposure, secondary trauma, and psychological effects. Pre-existing medical conditions include common non-communicable diseases that are typically medication-controlled (e.g., cardiorespiratory ailments, diabetes, psychological disorders), rely on recurring procedures (e.g., hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease), or a combination; some conditions require regular oxygen administration, powered life-support equipment, or other adjuncts. The link among all is the dependence on maintenance care, the disruption of which turns a chronic, relatively stable condition into an acute one at the worst possible time. Environmental causes include unmediated exposure to ambient environment, degraded air and water quality (including otherwise-controlled infectious diseases), and introduced toxicants (most commonly carbon monoxide). Secondary trauma includes motor-vehicle collisions, electrocution, and other injuries, particularly those related to repair and short-term recovery. Psychological causes include response to the primary event beyond effects of pre-existing conditions: disruption to lifelines and routine and extended effects (e.g., prolonged outages, seismic aftershocks, personal loss). Most secondary health effects of disasters are predictable and can be prevented or at least lessened by the combination of awareness and deliberate action by governments, institutions, support services, and individuals. In actual practice, secondary effects recur in most events and see limited preventive measures.",

      "abstract": "In two patients, women aged 85 and 80 years, who suffered from visual hallucinations involving living creatures, cars and buildings, Charles Bonnet syndrome was diagnosed. Both were worried that these signs were an indication of a severe psychiatric condition. In diagnosing the Charles Bonnet syndrome the following criteria can be used: presence of complex visual hallucinations, retention of insight, absence of hallucinations in other sensory modalities and absence of delusions. Hallucinations in dementia, delirium, migraine, epilepsy, or in extreme states of exhaustion or sensory deprivation, as well as hallucinations due to psychedelic drugs, hallucinations of widowhood and hypnagogic and hypnopompic hallucinations must be excluded. Patient education and reassurance are the cornerstones of treatment. Other possible treatments are: improving visual acuity and the general physical condition, stopping medication with hallucinogenic side effects, activating the patient, coaching the patient in avoiding hallucination-triggering situations and using stopping strategies, and (still experimental) pharmacological treatment with carbamazepine, valproate, ondansetron or cisapride.",

      "abstract": "Apart from special cases, hypnosis cannot be used to combat symptoms, nor to give the patient something he does not yet have. That it cannot be employed, as in the preanalytic period, as a means of interpretation and psychological exploration is clear from what is said by Anna Freud. After discussion in deep analysis during wakefulness, and in the light of the psychodynamic concepts of psychoanalysis, of the what interpretat to be given to the dynamic process of the symptom, we can exactly repeat this interpretation in a hypnotic trance. It is vulnerable, like hypnoid states (emotion, fear, anxiety, anger, fatigue, surmenage, transition from wakefulness to sleep) in which a psychic pathological process may easily start due to \"difference of level, blank in the consiousness\" and absent \"abreaction\". This vulnerability and increased tendency to accept has been encountered in hypnoid states as in artificially induced trances, and gives a much more rapid entrée to the patient's integration process. The interpretation of the dynamics of his symptom, once accepted, becomes an active force, and produces effects that would, in any event, have been produced if the integration process had occurred normally, without the acceleration provided by hypnotism, leading to resolution of the symptom. What is involved, therefore, is acceleration of the psychoanalytic process.",

The emotional outcome most often associated with stroke is depression (or depressed mood), and its frequency after stroke has led some to suggest that post-stroke depression is a distinct type. The increased recognition of mood disorders, behavioural changes, and cognitive impairment and their effects on patients, has resulted in the development of new interventions, a greater number of professionals skilled to intervene, and increased research evidence on intervention effectiveness. Psychological disorder and distress continue to be under-recognised, some disorders are incorrectly diagnosed and treated, and the relative lack of a research base means that nurses and doctors may be treating disorders in their patients without much certainty about the effectiveness of the interventions. Models of coping theories can help to explain patients' reactions.",

Cannabis is the most commonly used illicit drug in the United States; almost 44 million Americans report using in the past month. People who use cannabis may experience relaxation, euphoria, and mild hallucinogenic effects. Some may experience nausea and vomiting after use. Synthetic cannabinoids have been associated with more serious complications. Cessation after regular use may result in drug craving, insomnia, anorexia, and restlessness. Metabolites of THC can be detected in the urine up to a month after last use; some medications can cause false-positive tests. Serious medical complications of cannabis use are uncommon; the most concerning are neuropsychological problems among adolescent users and acute cognitive and motor impairment. Synthetic cannabinoid use is associated with significant neuropsychological effects. Psychosocial modalities appear to help those who wish to stop or cut down on use. There are no medications approved for the treatment of cannabis use disorder or cannabis withdrawal.",

      "abstract": "After aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage, acute subdural hematoma (SDH) is a rare consequence. SDH has never been linked to an unruptured intracavernous aneurysm. The most serious sort of subdural hematoma is this one. Following a head injury, the symptoms are severe and appear quickly, which can take anywhere from minutes to hours. The pressure on the brain quickly rises as blood accumulates. If you are not diagnosed and treated as soon as possible, you will die., you may lose consciousness, become paralysed, or even die. A subdural haematoma is potentially fatal. A serious head injury that causes blood vessels to burst is a common cause. As Blood can pool as a result, putting pressure on the brain. The effects of age and blood thinning medications, and other factors all raise the risk. as well as alcohol consumption Symptoms such as After a brain injury, symptoms such as headache, confusion, vomiting, slurred speech, or coma may emerge immediately or weeks later. Symptoms of a subdural haematoma may or may not occur. Main symptoms and Important clinical findings: Because the lower-pressure veins involved bleed more slowly than arteries, the main symptoms of a subdural hematoma appear later than those of an epidural haemorrhage. Acute hematoma signs and symptoms can occur in minutes, if not seconds, but they can also take up to two weeks to appear. Chronic subdural hematomas normally take four to seven weeks to manifest symptoms. The main diagnose, therapeutic intervention and outcomes: A subdural hematoma (SDH) is a common neurosurgical condition that frequently necessitates surgery. It's a sort of intracranial haemorrhage that happens behind the dura (basically, an accumulation of the presence of blood on the brain's surface) and can be linked to other brain traumas. Conclusion: The complication of ruptured, large intracavernous aneurysms is acute SDH. The postulated mechanism for the development of SDH is cavernous sinus wall erosion caused by acute aneurysm expansion after thrombosis.",

Postural hypotension may be a presenting feature in certain autonomic disorders (such as pure autonomic failure), it may be a pointer towards an alternative diagnosis (as in multiple system atrophy presenting with parkinsonian features), and it may complicate drug therapy (as with levodopa). Postural hypotension is associated with increased morbidity and also mortality, especially in elderly people, in whom falls result in injuries. Advances have resulted in a better understanding of the pathophysiological processes, and in the treatment of postural hypotension.\n\nPostural hypotension usually is considered when there are characteristic features resulting from cerebral ischaemia such as loss of consciousness (fainting, syncope). Other symptoms may occur (table1).2 Measuring blood pressure while lying and after 2 minutes of standing often confirms a postural fall. However, the lack of a fall, in the presence of suggestive symptoms, should warrant further investigation. There are various disorders, including the chronic fatigue syndrome and the postural tachycardia syndrome, in which postural intolerance may not be accompanied by hypotension.

The standard of investigation of children with severe mental retardation has improved very much in the past few years. New techniques have been developed, and unsuspected causes have been recognized. In phenylketonuria and a number of other errors of body chemistry, the normal function of the brain is disturbed. The phenylalanine is essential to normal brain activity, and the fact that it cannot be used in a normal manner may cause difficulty. Difficulty may also arise by interference of the excess of phenylalanine with other chemical activities in the brain and elsewhere. One rather striking side effect of this nature is interference with the normal production of the skin and hair pigment. This results in patients with phenylketonuria being fairer than their normal brothers and sisters. The cause of phenylketonuria is the absence or abnormality of an enzyme in the liver, which enables phenylalanine to be used. The nature of this enzyme is known but it has not been possible to devise any way in which the missing enzyme can be replaced.",

      "title": "Delayed post-hypoxic parkinsonism with leukoencephalopathy associated with carbon monoxide poisoning",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor, Delayed post-hypoxic leukoencephalopathy is a rare disorder that occurs following any event that causes prolonged cerebral hypo-oxygenation.[1] The earliest cases of this condition were associated with carbon monoxide (CO) exposure, which continues to be the most common inciting agent.[2] However, delayed post-hypoxic leukoencephalopathy is also associated with cardiac arrest, strangulation, anesthetic or surgical complications, benzodiazepine or opiate overdose, and hemorrhagic shock.[3-7] Although its exact incidence is unknown, it is likely to increase due to the decreased fatality rate resulting from improved medical care of the aforementioned causes; for example, the mortality rate with CO poisoning has decreased from 33% to 3% since the early 19th century.[8] Delayed post-hypoxic leukoencephalopathy characteristically presents in two phases: altered sensorium followed by complete recovery and a subsequent acute-onset neuropsychiatric syndrome with or without associated features such as parkinsonism, mutism, hyperreflexia, and frontal release signs. The lucid interval typically lasts 1–3 weeks (with a range of 2–40 days).[2] Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain reveals diffuse symmetrical anterior predominant cerebral white matter demyelination. A typical history with MRI findings that exclude alternative possibilities is sufficient for diagnosis. Early diagnosis is crucial to prevent unnecessary and unwarranted investigations and treatment. We present a case of delayed post-hypoxic parkinsonism and leukoencephalopathy following CO poisoning to emphasize the importance of early diagnosis. A 39-year-old man, with no prior comorbidities or addictions, was discovered unconscious in his room by his brother. The patient had not experienced any previous symptoms of fever, headache, or seizures but had slept in his room with burning logs of coal for warmth the previous night. He was taken to a nearby hospital, where he received a Glasgow coma scale score of E3V1M5 (9/15) and was intubated for airway protection. There were no signs of meningeal involvement. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed nonspecific changes [Figure 1], and his cerebrospinal fluid examination and routine investigations were within normal ranges. He was treated with high-flow oxygen and showed improvement over the next five days, following which he was extubated. He gradually regained near baseline status and was discharged after ten days. However, one week after his discharge, he developed a sudden onset of worsening behavioral symptoms (aggression and verbal abuse), generalized stiffness, and slowed activities (required more time to do tasks such as washing, eating, and conducting daily living activities). He also exhibited intellectual abnormalities (inability to understand spoken words, producing incomprehensible sounds, and forgetfulness regarding navigating around the house). Therefore, he was referred to our facility for further management. Upon examination, he appeared drowsy with mask-like facies and displayed cog-wheel rigidity, bradykinesia, and hyperreflexia in all limbs (without asymmetry). He did not exhibit tremors, his extra-ocular movements were normal, and he did not experience postural instability. A detailed cognitive and sensory assessment was not possible, and he did not present with any focal neurological deficits.Figure 1: Axial T2-WI (a, c) images show nonspecific multiple hyperintense foci in the deep frontal white matter (arrows in a) and bilateral centrum semiovale (c). These lesions are hyperintense on DWI (arrows in b and d) without any diffusion restriction in the ADC maps (not shown)The routine blood investigations were normal. The MRI brain revealed widespread bilateral white matter hyperintensities, without any restriction in diffusion and with patchy contrast enhancement [Figure 2]. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination revealed a slightly increased protein level (83 mg/dl) with no presence of cells and normal sugar levels. Viral markers for HIV, hepatitis B and C, serum and CSF autoimmune and paraneoplastic panel, extractable nuclear antigen panel, blood and urine toxicology screen, and CSF-venereal disease research laboratory all yielded negative results. The electroencephalogram revealed a diffuse delta slowing of brain waves.Figure 2: Follow-up MRI displays diffuse confluent symmetrical white matter hyperintensity T2-WI (a, b) and diffusion-weighted images (c, d) without any diffusion restriction in the ADC maps (e, f). Multiple foci of hyperintensities (arrows in b) are observed within the bilateral centrum semiovale, Following gadolinium administration, no enhancement is seen except for a few enhancing foci in the left centrum semiovaleBased on the patient's clinical presentation and the results of the investigations, a diagnosis of delayed post-hypoxic neurological deterioration was established. The patient was managed conservatively with the administration of atypical antipsychotics (quetiapine), levodopa-carbidopa, and baclofen. He continued to improve gradually and approached the baseline status over 6 months. Our patient developed delayed post-hypoxic neurological deterioration caused by CO poisoning resulting from sleeping in a closed room with biofuel combustion. CO binds tightly and preferentially to hemoglobin, thereby preventing oxygen binding and causing anemic hypoxia.[1] In addition, it inhibits cytochrome oxidase activity, inhibiting aerobic respiration.[1] Hypo-oxygenation and associated energy depletion of cerebral white matter lead to delayed apoptosis of oligodendrocytes due to glutamate-induced excitotoxicity.[9] CO poisoning can also occur from the use of gas geysers in domestic settings.[10] Correia et al.[10] reported cases of 26 patients developing unexplained neurodeficits while bathing in ill-ventilated bathrooms with gas geysers. Thirteen of these patients presented with acute CO intoxication, and two of them later developed parkinsonian features. Lee and Marsden reported cases of delayed post-hypoxic neurological manifestations as typically conforming to either parkinsonism or akinetic mutism along with the neuro-behavioral syndrome.[11] The patients who develop parkinsonism develop varying combinations of short-steppage gait, decreased arm swing, rigidity, bradykinesia, mask-like facies, and a stooped posture.[11] Certain patients even develop concomitant dystonic posturing of the limbs. Approximately 60% of the patients improve with supportive treatment and recover independent ambulation within 10–148 days after sequelae onset.[11] In our case, the patient had developed typical parkinsonian features (i.e., rigidity, bradykinesia, mask-like facies with hypokinetic dysarthria) and responded well to conservative management with levodopa and low doses of antipsychotics. The patient recovered his baseline status at the 6-month follow-up visit. Alternative diagnoses were ruled out through imaging, blood tests, and CSF testing. The prompt diagnosis and treatment prevented unnecessary resource utilization, such as brain biopsy or other invasive procedures, and provided symptomatic relief. Acknowledgment None.

      "title": "HEALTH EFFECTS OF COASTAL DISASTERS AFTER THE WATER RECEDES",
      "abstract": "Most disasters produce consistent death and injury patterns. Primary causes stem directly from the event itself and thus vary by event type, e.g., drowning in tropical storms and floods, injury and drowning in tsunamis. Secondary causes are driven by common effects regardless of event type: loss of electrical power and shelter, transportation disruption, loss of healthcare access, attempted repair/restoration, and other disruption of daily routine. Cause of death may be difficult to attribute, typically leading to undercounting. Secondary causes of death, illness, and injury can be divided into four broad categories: pre-existing medical conditions, environmental degradation or magnified exposure, secondary trauma, and psychological effects. All of these relate not only to post-impact outcomes but also may affect primary event survival. Pre-existing medical conditions include common non-communicable diseases that are typically medication-controlled (e.g., cardiorespiratory, diabetic, and psychological disorders) and/or rely on recurring outpatient procedures (e.g., hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease); some conditions require home oxygen administration, powered life-support equipment, or other adjuncts. All categories rely on maintenance care, lack of which turns a chronic, relatively stable condition into an acute one at the worst possible time. Environmental causes include unmediated exposure to ambient environment, degraded air and water quality (including otherwise-controlled infectious diseases), and introduced toxicants, particularly carbon monoxide. Secondary trauma includes motor-vehicle collisions, electrocution, and other injuries, particularly those related to repair and short-term recovery. Psychological causes, beyond preexisting conditions, include disrupted routine and lifelines and extended effects (e.g., prolonged disruption, personal loss, subsequent events). Most secondary health effects are recurrent and thus predictable well in advance of an incident. Even if they canâ€™t be prevented in entirety they can be lessened by awareness and deliberate action on the part of governments, institutions, support services, and individuals, including more realistic assumptions, expanded insurance coverage, and refocused preparedness campaigns.",

      "title": "Sedative-Hypnotics: Addiction and Current Research Status",
      "abstract": "Central nervous system depressants, e.g. alcohol, barbiturates, and benzodiazepines, have a wide spectrum of activity in human and animals. These depressants produce varying degrees of CNS depression, depending mainly upon the dose used. In small doses, they can alleviate anxiety and/or reduce spontaneous activity; in moderate doses, they induce sleep; with large doses, severe CNS depression progresses to anesthesia, coma or even death. This graded, dose-dependent CNS depression is a common feature of these agents. In addition to causing CNS depression, these agents also possess other pharmacological properties, e. g. muscle relaxation, Anticonvulsant activity, respiratory depression, hypothermia, etc. Tolerance-dependence developing to sedative-hypnotics is a common feature following continuous administration of sedative-hypnotics. Tolerance is defined as a decreasing response to repeated administration of the same dose of a sedative-hypnotic or as a necessary increase of the dosage to obtain the initial response. There are two types of tolerance-one dispositional (pharmacokinetic), the other functional (pharmacodynamic). Dependence is defined as a modification of physiological functions that require continuous drug adiministration to prevent the appearance of withdrawal symptoms. Abrupt withdrawal from long-term usage of these drugs may produce anxiety, dizziness, nausea and vomiting, insomnia, muscular twitching, hyperthermia, delirium, tremors, convulsions, and death. Evidence accumulated suggests that some of the pharmacological actions exerted by sedative-hypnotics, e.g benzodiazepines, barbiturates and alcohol, may be mediated through the GABA system by mimicking GABAergic transmission. However, the mechanisms of the actions of these agents on the GABA system remain to be elucidated. Benzodiazepines have been demonstrated to have receptors which are parts of the GABAA receptors (GABA benzodiazepine receptor chloride ionophore complexes). Although a definitive barbiturate binding site has not yet been identified, the available evidence strongly suggests that barbiturate binding sites and convulsant binding sites are separate but allosterically affect each other. As far as ethanol is concerned, it is likely that multiple neurotransmitter systems are affected. Therefore, it is still unclear how alcohol, barbiturates, and benzodiazepines are functionally associated with the GABA system. The evidence summarized demonstrates that the GABA synapse plays an important role in the pharmacologic effects of barbiturates, alcohol and benzodiazepines. There are similarities and differences in the effects of these CNS depressants on the pharmacology and biochemistry of the GABA synapse. The effects of alcohol, barbiturates and benzodiazepines on GABA synapses are different in different brain regions. Furthermore, the results which have been reported in the literature are inconsistent. This may be due to differences in (a) animal models used, (b) brain regions used, (c) protocols used in treating the animals (dose, duration, form and route of administration, etc.) and/or (d) techniques used (pharmacological, biochemical, physiological, etc.)",

      "title": "The symptom of generalised fatigue",
      "abstract": "What is fatigue? It is a sensation that we all feel at times and which has a variety of synonyms such as tiredness, exhaustion, and weariness.1 In this article we are concerned with a general feeling of fatigue or exhaustion and not with fatigue specific to a part of the body; this is sometimes called central as opposed to peripheral fatigue.2 Although one may interpret a complaint of \"fatigue\" as meaning whatever the patient wants it to mean, it is useful to apply more precision by exploring exactly what the patient means by the term. For example, to differentiate the core concept of fatigue as a lack of ability to initiate or sustain activities because of a feeling of lack of energy, from other meanings such as the \"lack of interest and motivation\" that is typical of depression, and the \"tendency to fall asleep\" that is typical of sleep disorders. When is fatigue abnormal? Fatigue as a symptom must be differentiated from normal tiredness. Given that the severity of fatigue is continuously distributed in the population (fig 1), we need to draw some kind of cutoff to define fatigue of clinically important severity, in the same way that we do for blood pressure and depression. One approach is to define this as fatigue that has persisted for a period of time (say a month or more) and that is of sufficient severity to interfere with the patient's activities or to be otherwise severely troublesome. A patient with fatigue of this severity and duration may then be referred to as \"a case\" of clinically significant fatigue. Figure 1 The distribution of the complaint of fatigue in the population.

Death within 12 hours of arrest is commonly associated with massive drug overdose, such as can occur with smugglers who conceal drugs within body cavities, an act that is known as \"body packing.\" Deaths that occur days to weeks or longer after incarceration can be associated with drug withdrawal or other natural causes related to drug use (2).",

      "title": "[Cognitive and behavioral consequences of epilepsy during the course of brain development].",
      "abstract": "The notion that cognitive and behavioural dysfunctions of epileptic origin can be prolonged and with an insidious onset, has meant a radical conceptual change about epilepsy considered so far uniquely as a paroxysmal disorder. Also, these dysfunctions can be the only observable manifestations of the disorder. It is particularly true in some epileptic syndromes with onset in childhood. Epileptic dysfunctions are characterized by a discontinuity in time (intermittent, recurrent), in space (cerebral localization of the dysfunction and its spread). They often have a significant relationship with sleep. These features, with sometimes the existential dimension of some symptoms (intermittent loss of the flux of consciousness, intermittent perceptual distortions or cognitive-emotional dysfunction) are not seen in any other congenital or acquired disorders of the human brain. Longitudinal clinical studies in which the epileptic variable can be directly correlated with the precise study of the cognitive dysfunction (also with increasingly complex methods of brain imaging) are a difficult, relatively new multidisciplinary task, especially in the very young child. Case examples of children followed from early childhood to adulthood will illustrate the diversity of observed cognitive and behavioural abnormalities directly caused by the epileptic activity which can be massive or very discrete. One is only beginning to document precisely the late consequences (or absence of) of some early childhood epilepsies that had a direct impact on developing brain function at some point.",

The brain is able to form glycogen in astrocytes and neurons via glycogen synthase and branching enzyme. Once formed, brain glycogen functions as the only stored energy source for these cells. Various physiological roles for brain glycogen have been hypothesized, including memory consolidation and sleep regulation, as well as a protective role during various physiological stressors, such as hypoglycemia and hypoxia. For instance, rat brain glycogen levels were decreased 10 minutes after vaginal birth, but not after a C-section. This suggested that cerebral hypoxia experienced during vaginal birth induced the utilization of brain glycogen to minimize neurodegeneration during the hypoxic event. Symptoms of hypoxia can range from tachycardia, tachypnea, shortness of breath, and diaphoresis to confusion, loss of motor coordination and cognitive function, neurodegeneration, and brain death. The many causes of hypoxia include lungs diseases (COPD, pneumonia, pulmonary edema), CNS depressants (opiates), heart problems (CHF), anemia, and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). We hypothesized that the lack of brain glycogen would cause a noticeable detrimental effect to the survival time and physiologic functions of mice exposed to acute hypoxia. Experimental Design or Project Methods: We subjected mice, with or without glycogen synthase disrupted in the brain, to carbon dioxide- or nitrogen-induced hypoxia and monitored effects on brain glycogen levels, behavior, and survival time. Results: We found that mice lacking brain glycogen exhibited the characteristic physiologic responses to hypoxia, but expired ~50% sooner than mice with brain glycogen. Conclusion and Potential Impact: These results provide evidence that brain glycogen is imperative in responding to hypoxic events. Further, these findings suggest that brain glycogen may protect patients with OSA against other comorbidities, especially neurodegeneration and cognitive impairment.",

Post concussion syndrome is a constellation of symptoms that may follow a mild to moderate closed head injury. Symptoms of post concussion syndrome include headache, depression, irritability, memory impairment, alcohol intolerance, dizziness or vertigo, attention and concentration difficulties, and loss of libido. Concussion, minor head injury, and minor traumatic brain injury are difficult to define, compared with moderate or severe injury, in which structural damage is evident. The American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine defined minor traumatic brain injury as “a traumatically induced physiological disruption of brain function” with at least one of the following: (1) any period of loss of consciousness; (2) any memory loss for events just before or after the accident; (3) any alteration in mental state at the time of the accident; and (4) focal neurologic deficits that may or may not be transient (Packard, 1999).",

      "title": "Psychosis: impact on the patient and family.",
      "abstract": "Psychosis represents a milestone in the progression of PD, often severely taxing caregivers and frequently warranting nursing-home placement. This step is often necessary because caregivers cannot tolerate, among other stressors, their loved ones' sexual aberrations and irrational accusations (which can be caused by paranoid ideation). Other salient features of parkinsonian psychosis comprise vivid nightmares, which often herald its onset; hallucinations, which are principally visual and stereotypical in content; agitation; aggression; delirium; and confusion that exceeds the typical erosion in mentation. Hallucinosis and paranoid ideation may in turn precipitate weight loss; food may be deemed inedible because of imagined contaminants, for instance, either worm infestations or a delusional fear of poisoning by the caregiver. Parkinsonian psychosis exhibits an age predilection; correlates with the duration of disease and levodopa therapy; and may be associated with increases in the dosage of this agent or other drugs given, either as monotherapy or with levodopa. Levodopa or dopamine agonist toxicity can lead to psychosis because of dopaminergic hypersensitivity. Unfortunately, attempts to diminish this untoward effect (eg, reducing the levodopa dosage, introducing neuroleptics) may curb the psychosis but also erode control of parkinsonian features. To avert this \"dopamine dilemma,\" we have tested a selective serotonin antagonist (ondansetron), which essentially attenuated visual hallucinosis, improved delusional ideation and confusion, and was well tolerated. Other agents that can be tried for parkinsonian psychosis include the atypical neuroleptics olanzapine and clozapine.",

A pertinent question herein is whether such substances might adversely affect testimonies of victims, eyewitnesses, or suspects by propelling the formation of false memory and increasing susceptibility to suggestion. In the current review, we amassed all available evidence on the effects of intoxication on false memory formation and suggestibility, including the substances alcohol, benzodiazepines, cannabis, stimulants, hallucinogens, and antipsychotics. Our review indicated that alcohol and cannabis under certain conditions increased the susceptibility to false memories and/or suggestion with effect sizes ranging from medium to large. When intoxicated during an event, alcohol is most likely to increase this susceptibility at high intoxication levels or after a delay, whereas cannabis exerts detrimental effects during acute intoxication but not necessarily once sober. For other substances, ecologically valid research separating different memory phases is needed. Overall, differences between substances regarding false memory effects exist, suggesting that a nuanced approach is needed when dealing with intoxicated individuals in a legal context.",

      "abstract": "The previous two decades have been marked by profound societal transformations, including ongoing developments in the illegal drug market and the emergence of numerous novel psychoactive substances. Nevertheless, a comprehensive understanding of the diverse clinical presentations of psychopathological conditions, particularly within the domain of psychotic symptoms, remains deficient. In this clinical overview, our aim is to provide a detailed analysis of the psychotic manifestations induced by various substances. Exogenous psychoses may present with visual hallucinations, delusional perceptions, and paranoid ideation, frequently accompanied by an ego-dystonic experience that deviate from an individual's customary self-identity. Variations in the presentation of symptoms are also influenced by the specific pharmacological pathways with which the substance interacts. Visual hallucinations characterized by vivid colours and associated with positive or negative emotional experiences are most frequently linked to the serotonergic pathway. Paranoid ideation and auditory hallucinations are primarily associated with the dopaminergic pathways. Dissociative responses, often characterized by feelings of derealization and somatopsychic depersonalization, are typically elicited through glutamatergic pathways. Lastly, the endocannabinoid pathways are associated with anxiety-related psychosis-like states, ideas of reference, grandiose delusions, and paranoid delusions.",

      "title": "Psychological aspects of depression in cancer patients: an update",
      "abstract": "Depression and disorders of the depressive spectrum frequently remain underdiagnosed and undertreated in the cancer setting, despite their prevalence and the degree of suffering they impose on cancer patients. Initial shock, disbelief and denial are frequent upon confirmation of the cancer diagnosis. Generally, they begin to resolve within a few weeks as the patient receives support from family, friends and beliefs in addition to the support and outline provided by the medical oncologist, of a treatment plan that offers hope and reduces part of the uncertainty that is so difficult to deal with in oncology. However, multiple losses throughout the disease process, beginning with the loss of one's own health (followed by loss of body image, professional role, family roles, social roles, etc.) result in grief reactions and sadness that often accompany the cancer patient throughout the disease process. It is not uncommon, therefore, for depressed patients to feel depressed or sad at diagnosis, during treatment administration (due to toxicity, physical limitations, loss of body functions, changes in physical appearance, etc.); during remission and survival (e.g. due to fear of not receiving treatment that may keep the disease from reappearing, or due to inability to conduct life activities prior to diagnosis, among others); and during disease progression and palliative care (due to physical deterioration, confrontation with complex life and death issues, etc.). Depressive symptoms may, therefore, persist over time requiring specialized attention.Depression is among the leading causes of disability worldwide, leading in some cases, to suicide. Reported prevalence rates of depression among cancer patients can be as high as 38% for major depression and 58% for depression spectrum syndromes [1.Massie M.J. Prevalence of depression in patients with cancer.J Natl Cancer Inst Monogr. 2004; 32: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar]. Differences in reported prevalence rates are due to differences in assessment methods, as well as differences in stage and tumor site, among others.Risk factors for developing depressive symptoms or disorders in cancer patients include young age, social isolation and lack of social support, poverty, previous negative experience with the disease in the family or personal experiences of physical illness, recurrence and advanced disease, physical deterioration, tumor location (lung, pancreatic, head and neck), presence of physical symptoms from cancer, such as pain, especially if not well controlled; history of multiple losses; previous psychiatric disorders, especially episodes of depression or suicide attempts; history of substance abuse and others.Psychological factors that may also influence the appearance of depression or depressive symptoms in the oncology setting include but are not limited to the following: loss of autonomy; confrontation with death and dying; fear of suffering; death of other patients; reaction of family members to the illness; presence of unresolved issues; pre-existing family conflict; personality factors such as pessimism and a tendency to consider life experiences as uncontrollable and inevitable.Ideally, all cancer patients be screened for depression in the clinic upon their first visit and on a regular basis thereafter by their oncologist, especially when changes occur in their disease status (remission, recurrence, progression of disease etc.). The distress thermometer is a valid and reliable screening tool. Patients are asked about the nature and source of their distress (whether it be physical, social, psychological or spiritual). In addition to detecting distress, the thermometer facilitates referral to the appropriate professional working in the oncology team (mental health, social work, pastoral counselor, etc.) [2.Holland J. Bultz B. The NCCN guideline for distress management: a case for making distress the sixth vital sign.J Natl Compr Canc Netw. 2007; 5: 3-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar].Diagnosis of depression in physically healthy individuals relies heavily on the presence of somatic symptoms (anorexia, insomnia and weight loss). However, these are of little value in cancer patients since they are common to both cancer and depression. Four different approaches have been described in the assessment of depression in the medically ill [3.Cohen-Cole Sa Brown F.N. McDaniel J.S. Stoudmire A. Fogel B. Diagnostic assessment of depression in the medically ill.Psychiatric Care of the Medical Patient. Oxford University Press, New York1993: 53-70Google Scholar, 4.Endicott J. Measurement of depression in patients with cancer.Cancer. 1984; 53: 2243-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar]:•Inclusive approach: counts all symptoms of depression, whether or not they may be secondary to the physical illness. This approach offers high sensitivity but low specificity and does not focus on etiology.•Etiologic approach: This approach counts a depressive symptom only if it is presumed not secondary to physical illness.•Exclusive approach: Eliminates symptoms such as anorexia and fatigue, which can be secondary to cancer, and employs other depression criteria. This approach increases specificity and lowers sensitivity which may result in lower prevalence and underdiagnosis.•Substitutive approach: Replaces indeterminate symptoms such as fatigue (frequently secondary to physical illness) with cognitive symptoms such as indecisiveness, brooding and hopelessness.Criteria for the diagnosis of a major depressive disorder based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [5.american Psychiatric association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.4th edition, text revision. american Psychiatric association, arlington, Va2000Google Scholar] include:Five or more of the following symptoms have been present during the same 2-week period and represent a change from previous functioning, with at least one of the symptoms being either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure:1.Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either subjective report or observations by others2.Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all or almost all activities, most of the day, nearly every day3.Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain, or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day4.Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day5.Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day6.Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day7.Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt nearly every day8.Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day, and9.Recurrent thoughts of death, recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide.In addition, the symptoms do not meet criteria for a mixed episode; they cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other important areas of functioning; they are not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance; they are not better accounted for by bereavement; they persist for longer than 2 months or are characterized by marked functional impairment, morbid preoccupation with worthlessness, suicidal ideation, psychotic symptoms or psychomotor retardation.The diagnosis of depression in the oncology setting should depend on psychological not somatic symptoms, in cancer patients [6.Massie M.J. Holland J. Holland J. Rowland J. Overview of normal reactions and prevalence of psychiatric disorders.Handbook of Psycho-Oncology: Psychological Care of the Patient with Cancer. Oxford University Press, New York1989: 273-282Google Scholar]:•Dysphoric mood•Feelings of helplessness and hopelessness•Loss of self-esteem•Feelings of worthlessness or guilt•anhedonia•Thoughts of death or wishing for death or suicideDifferential diagnosis should include normal reactions to illness and loss; adjustment disorders with depressed and/or anxious mood, and should determine whether organic factors underlie the depressive syndrome. When physiologic effects of cancer directly cause depressive syndromes, a diagnosis of mood disorder due to a general medical condition should be made.Demoralization syndrome, described by Kissane et al. [7.Kissane D.W. Clarke D.M. Street Af Demoralization syndrome: a relevant psychiatric diagnosis for palliative care.J Palliat Care. 2001; 17: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar], should be distinguished from depression and includes affective symptoms of existential distress (hopelessness or loss of meaning in life); pessimism, helplessness, a sense of being trapped, personal failure or lacking a worthwhile future; absence of motivation to cope differently, and associated features of social alienation or isolation and lack of support. Demoralization syndrome is said to occur in at least 20% of patients who do not meet DSM-IV criteria for the diagnosis of a mental disorder [8.Grassi L. Holland J. Johansen C.

Initial validation of a scale to measure purposelessness, understimulation and boredom in cancer patients.Palliat Support Care. 2003; 1: 41-50Crossref PubMed Google Scholar] developed a Purposelessness, Understimulation and Boredom Scale to identify boredom and found this construct to be different from depression in the oncology setting.Multiple psychological measurement instruments have been described as useful in the diagnosis of depression in cancer patients. However, a single-item question: 'Have you been depressed, most of the day, nearly every day, for the past two weeks or more?' seems to be able to identify all cancer patients diagnosed as depressed using Research Diagnostic Criteria [10.Chochinov H.M. Wilson K.G. Enns M. are you depressed?' Screening for depression in the terminally ill.aM J Psychiatry. 1997; 154: 674-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar].Suicide is associated with emotional suffering and, at times, with physical disease. Suicide has been reported to be 1.5–2 times higher in cancer patients than in the general population [11.Hem E. Loge J.H. Haldorsen T. et al.Suicide risk in cancer patients from 1960 to 1999.J Clin Oncol. 2004; 22: 4209-4216Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar]. among terminally ill patients with cancer, the request for euthanasia is about four times higher in patients with depression than in those without depression [12.Van der Lee M.L. van der Bom J.G. et al.Euthanasia and depression: a prospective cohort study among terminally ill cancer patients.J Clin Oncol. 2005; 23: 6607-6612Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar]. In addition, desire for death in terminally ill cancer patients is frequent. It has been shown to be associated with depression and is transitory [13.Chochinov H.M. Wilson K.G. Enns M. et al.Desire for death in the terminally ill.am J Psychiatry. 1995; 152: 1185-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar]. Suicide risk protocols should include an evaluation of thoughts about death, dying and suicide, as well as an evaluation of the presence of a plan to commit suicide, the patient's intention to carry out such plan and its viability.an association between depression and an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. interleukin-1, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha) has been described. Cancer itself and its treatment (medications and surgery) in general can be responsible, together with the individual stress response, for the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines which may contribute to the development of depressive symptoms [14.Riba M. Grassi L. WPa Educational Programme on Depressive Disorders, Vol. 2. Physical Illness and Depression Disorders in Physical Illness. World Psychiatric association, Chêne-Bourg, Switzerland2008: 73-87Google Scholar].Depression and depressive symptoms should always be treated in the cancer setting. Because sadness and depressive symptoms are considered to be 'normal' reactions to the disease and its treatment, quite frequently they remain undertreated. They tend to be a manifestation or consequence of emotional suffering. Not treating them will trivialize the patient's suffering associated with the disease and death.adequate treatment of depression in the oncology setting should combine the control or elimination of potential organic causes of depression when possible; pharmacotherapy; psychotherapy and psychological intervention with the patients' families and staff members. Efficient communication skills between doctor and patient are needed as well.The choice of the best psychotropic drug for the pharmacological treatment of depression in cancer will depend on various factors [14.Riba M. Grassi L. WPa Educational Programme on Depressive Disorders, Vol. 2. Physical Illness and Depression Disorders in Physical Illness. World Psychiatric association, Chêne-Bourg, Switzerland2008: 73-87Google Scholar]:•Which is the safest drug or which has the fewest side-effects for the cancer patient•What the characteristics of the depressive episode are, and•Which is the best way of administration for a particular patient (pills versus liquid versus parenteral).General guidelines for the use of antidepressants in the cancer setting have been described [14.Riba M. Grassi L. WPa Educational Programme on Depressive Disorders, Vol. 2. Physical Illness and Depression Disorders in Physical Illness. World Psychiatric association, Chêne-Bourg, Switzerland2008: 73-87Google Scholar] and include:•Starting the dose according to patients' condition (usually half dose for a few days, then titrate)•Waiting for the effects of the drugs (latency: usually 4 weeks)•Providing continued treatment for 6–9 months (more if depression or depressive episode are recurrent)•Discontinuing antidepressant treatment gradually by tapering the dose and providing adequate follow-up•Monitoring symptoms on a continued basis to watch for potential drug interactions that may occur between antidepressants and certain chemotherapeutic agentsPsychotherapy may be an excellent alternative for those who refuse taking antidepressants. In addition, it has no side effects! as with antidepressants, it is necessary to adjust the psychotherapeutic modality to patient's needs and disease stage. Psycho-educational interventions such as clarifying information, among others, are effective usually throughout the disease continuum, although may be more needed at diagnosis, when passing from one stage of the illness to another, for example, initiation and end of treatment; upon starting palliative care, etc. Couple and Family Therapies may be appropriate when conflicting relationships within the couple or the family contribute substantially or are the main cause of the patients' depressive symptoms. Cognitive techniques may be useful in correcting misconceptions and exacerbated fears. Interventions directed to enhance the spiritual aspects in advanced disease and dying are of utmost importance at this stage of the illness, when patients are confronted with life-death issues that generally imply deep existential questioning [15.Breitbart W. Spirituality and meaning in supportive care: spirituality and meaning-centered group psychotherapy interventions in advanced cancer.Support Care Cancer. 2002; 10: 272-280Crossref PubMed Scopus (314) Google Scholar]. Helping patients discover the meaning they assign to their symptoms, to their disease, to life and death, to suffering, etc., and helping them accept suffering as an integral part of life, is of utmost importance. Finding meaning in the context of advanced or serious illness is quite a challenge that not everyone is capable of achieving. In addition, interventions designed to maintain patients' dignity have been described as well and are very helpful in improving patients' mood [16.Chochinov H.M. Hack T. Hassard T. et al.Dignity therapy: a novel psychotherapeutic intervention for patients near the end of life.J Clin Oncol. 2005; 23: 5520-5525Crossref PubMed Scopus (614) Google Scholar]. Multidimensional structured and semi-structured group psychotherapies have proven to be effective in reducing patients' depressive symptomatology and improving their quality of life [17.Spiegel D. Spira J. Supportive Expressive Group Therapy: a Treatment Manual of Psychosocial Intervention for Woman with Recurrent Breast Cancer..

Staff should be trained to provide basic emotional support effectively as well as to communicate efficiently with the patient and his/her family. Some simple interventions staff may easily implement are related to increasing the patient's perception of control. Cancer influences the patient in such a way that it substantially reduces the perception of control that the patient has over his own life. In order to help patients regain their sense of control staff members may:•provide options to patient. For example, giving him the possibility of choosing whether he wants to have his medication with water, milk or juice helps the patient believe he still has the power to decide over what is happening to him, especially at times when the patient is hospitalized and his hospital days revolve around medication intake, doctor and nurses' visits, medical tests, etc.•anticipate patients' needs. This will help him feel more in control of what may happen to him and will reduce fear and distress upon the development of new symptoms or changes in the patient's body, functions, etc.•facilitate adaptive coping mechanisms, for example, by identifying with the patient effective ways in which he/she has confronted and resolved difficulties encountered in the past•respect defense mechanisms as long as they do not interfere with treatment administration•normalize patient's feelings•help maintain realistic hope: Even in the context of palliative care can hope be maintained. For example, a non-depressed dying patient may hope to die without suffering, or after having solved certain issues, or he may hope that his family will not suffer in excess after his death.•remain available to listen to patient's worries and fears•explain to patient and family that depressive symptoms can be treated•provide continuity in patient care•monitor patient's sense of wellbeing and needs in a continued manner along the disease continuum, since they change over time•work with the family: provide basic caretaking guidelines and support for family members. Facilitate their understanding of what depression is and why the patient may be depressed. It may be difficult for family members to comprehend, for example, why the patient develops depressive symptomatology upon finishing his treatment.•explore one's own attitudes towards illness, suffering, death and dying•inform adequately: staff members should have efficient training in communication skills as to be able to handle difficult interactions with patients at complex moments of the disease process. adequate doctor–patient communication will:•reduce patient's fears and anxiety,•help patient understand and elaborate relevant medical information,•increase patient's perception of control,•allow the patient to discuss relevant worries that may interfere with treatment administration, with the oncologist,•enhance treatment adherence,•facilitate patient's global psychological adjustment.A six-step protocol to deliver bad news and improve doctor–patient communication (SPIKES) has been described [20.Baile W.F. Buckman R. Lenzi R. et al.SIKES—a six-step protocol for delivering bad news: application to the patient with cancer.Oncologist. 2000; 5: 302-311Crossref PubMed Scopus (1575) Google Scholar] and includes the following:•S Setting: prepare an adequate environment. This may be achieved by providing privacy, involving significant others, establishing rapport with patient, etc.•P Perception: ask yourself 'How does the patient perceive his medical situation?'. and, 'Before you tell, ask' (for example, 'What do you suspect your symptoms are due to?').•I Invitation: obtain patient's invitation to deliver medical information. 'How would you like me to give you your test results?' could be a good way to start.•K Knowledge: deliver the medical information: 'I am sorry to tell you that your test results have revealed …'.•E Empathizing and Exploring: assess the patients emotions using empathetic responses, for example 'I understand this must be very difficult for you at this time of your life'.•S Strategy and Summary: Describe strategy/follow-up and summarize the interview making sure that the patient has understood the information provided.This educational workshop will focus on the diagnosis and treatment of depressive disorders in cancer patients. Diagnostic criteria for depression and for suicide risk as well as psychotherapeutic guidelines to treat depression effectively will be provided. Theoretical aspects of the different topics covered will be illustrated with case vignettes and brief video sketches.In summary, depression is frequent in the cancer setting and should receive adequate attention from professionals. as with other illnesses, its correct although sometimes difficult diagnosis in oncology will allow the design of interventions tailored to address patient needs, intensity of symptoms and others. Treatment of depression should not be targeted to the patient only but should include family and oncology staff members as well.disclosureThe author has declared no conflicts of interest. Depression and disorders of the depressive spectrum frequently remain underdiagnosed and undertreated in the cancer setting, despite their prevalence and the degree of suffering they impose on cancer patients. Initial shock, disbelief and denial are frequent upon confirmation of the cancer diagnosis. Generally, they begin to resolve within a few weeks as the patient receives support from family, friends and beliefs in addition to the support and outline provided by the medical oncologist, of a treatment plan that offers hope and reduces part of the uncertainty that is so difficult to deal with in oncology. However, multiple losses throughout the disease process, beginning with the loss of one's own health (followed by loss of body image, professional role, family roles, social roles, etc.) result in grief reactions and sadness that often accompany the cancer patient throughout the disease process. It is not uncommon, therefore, for depressed patients to feel depressed or sad at diagnosis, during treatment administration (due to toxicity, physical limitations, loss of body functions, changes in physical appearance, etc.); during remission and survival (e.g. due to fear of not receiving treatment that may keep the disease from reappearing, or due to inability to conduct life activities prior to diagnosis, among others); and during disease progression and palliative care (due to physical deterioration, confrontation with complex life and death issues, etc.). Depressive symptoms may, therefore, persist over time requiring specialized attention. Depression is among the leading causes of disability worldwide, leading in some cases, to suicide. Reported prevalence rates of depression among cancer patients can be as high as 38% for major depression and 58% for depression spectrum syndromes [1.Massie M.J. Prevalence of depression in patients with cancer.J Natl Cancer Inst Monogr. 2004; 32: 57-71Crossref PubMed Scopus (990) Google Scholar]. Differences in reported prevalence rates are due to differences in assessment methods, as well as differences in stage and tumor site, among others. Risk factors for developing depressive symptoms or disorders in cancer patients include young age, social isolation and lack of social support, poverty, previous negative experience with the disease in the family or personal experiences of physical illness, recurrence and advanced disease, physical deterioration, tumor location (lung, pancreatic, head and neck), presence of physical symptoms from cancer, such as pain, especially if not well controlled; history of multiple losses; previous psychiatric disorders, especially episodes of depression or suicide attempts; history of substance abuse and others. Psychological factors that may also influence the appearance of depression or depressive symptoms in the oncology setting include but are not limited to the following: loss of autonomy; confrontation with death and dying; fear of suffering; death of other patients; reaction of family members to the illness; presence of unresolved issues; pre-existing family conflict; personality factors such as pessimism and a tendency to consider life experiences as uncontrollable and inevitable. Ideally, all cancer patients be screened for depression in the clinic upon their first visit and on a regular basis thereafter by their oncologist, especially when changes occur in their disease status (remission, recurrence, progression of disease etc.). The distress thermometer is a valid and reliable screening tool. Patients are asked about the nature and source of their distress (whether it be physical, social, psychological or spiritual). In addition to detecting distress, the thermometer facilitates referral to the appropriate professional working in the oncology team (mental health, social work, pastoral counselor, etc.) [2.Holland J. Bultz B. The NCCN guideline for distress management: a case for making distress the sixth vital sign.J Natl Compr Canc Netw. 2007; 5: 3-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (331) Google Scholar]. Diagnosis of depression in physically healthy individuals relies heavily on the presence of somatic symptoms (anorexia, insomnia and weight loss). However, these are of little value in cancer patients since they are common to both cancer and depression. Four different approaches have been described in the assessment of depression in the medically ill [3.Cohen-Cole Sa Brown F.N. McDaniel J.S. Stoudmire A. Fogel B. Diagnostic assessment of depression in the medically ill.Psychiatric Care of the Medical Patient. Oxford University Press, New York1993: 53-70Google Scholar, 4.Endicott J. Measurement of depression in patients with cancer.Cancer. 1984; 53: 2243-2249Crossref PubMed Scopus (421) Google Scholar]:•Inclusive approach: counts all symptoms of depression, whether or not they may be secondary to the physical illness. This approach offers high sensitivity but low specificity and does not focus on etiology.•Etiologic approach: This approach counts a depressive symptom only if it is presumed not secondary to physical illness.•Exclusive approach: Eliminates symptoms such as anorexia and fatigue, which can be secondary to cancer, and employs other depression criteria. This approach increases specificity and lowers sensitivity which may result in lower prevalence and underdiagnosis.•Substitutive approach: Replaces indeterminate symptoms such as fatigue (frequently secondary to physical illness) with cognitive symptoms such as indecisiveness, brooding and hopelessness. Criteria for the diagnosis of a major depressive disorder based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [5.american Psychiatric association Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.4th edition, text revision. american Psychiatric association, arlington, Va2000Google Scholar] include:Five or more of the following symptoms have been present during the same 2-week period and represent a change from previous functioning, with at least one of the symptoms being either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure:1.Depressed mood most of the day, nearly every day, as indicated by either subjective report or observations by others2.Markedly diminished interest or pleasure in all or almost all activities, most of the day, nearly every day3.Significant weight loss when not dieting or weight gain, or decrease or increase in appetite nearly every day4.Insomnia or hypersomnia nearly every day5.Psychomotor agitation or retardation nearly every day6.Fatigue or loss of energy nearly every day7.Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt nearly every day8.Diminished ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness, nearly every day, and9.Recurrent thoughts of death, recurrent suicidal ideation without a specific plan, or a suicide attempt or a specific plan for committing suicide. In addition, the symptoms do not meet criteria for a mixed episode; they cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other important areas of functioning; they are not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance; they are not better accounted for by bereavement; they persist for longer than 2 months or are characterized by marked functional impairment, morbid preoccupation with worthlessness, suicidal ideation, psychotic symptoms or psychomotor retardation. The diagnosis of depression in the oncology setting should depend on psychological not somatic symptoms, in cancer patients [6.Massie M.J. Holland J. Holland J. Rowland J. Overview of normal reactions and prevalence of psychiatric disorders.Handbook of Psycho-Oncology: Psychological Care of the Patient with Cancer. Oxford University Press, New York1989: 273-282Google Scholar]:•Dysphoric mood•Feelings of helplessness and hopelessness•Loss of self-esteem•Feelings of worthlessness or guilt•anhedonia•Thoughts of death or wishing for death or suicide Differential diagnosis should include normal reactions to illness and loss; adjustment disorders with depressed and/or anxious mood, and should determine whether organic factors underlie the depressive syndrome. When physiologic effects of cancer directly cause depressive syndromes, a diagnosis of mood disorder due to a general medical condition should be made. Demoralization syndrome, described by Kissane et al. [7.Kissane D.W. Clarke D.M. Street Af Demoralization syndrome: a relevant psychiatric diagnosis for palliative care.J Palliat Care. 2001; 17: 12-21Crossref PubMed Scopus (335) Google Scholar], should be distinguished from depression and includes affective symptoms of existential distress (hopelessness or loss of meaning in life); pessimism, helplessness, a sense of being trapped, personal failure or lacking a worthwhile future; absence of motivation to cope differently, and associated features of social alienation or isolation and lack of support. Demoralization syndrome is said to occur in at least 20% of patients who do not meet DSM-IV criteria for the diagnosis of a mental disorder [8.Grassi L. Holland J. Johansen C. Psychiatric concomitants of cancer screening procedures, and training of health care professionals in oncology: the paradigms of psycho-oncology in the psychiatry field.adv Psychiatr. 2005; 2: 59-66Google Scholar]. Boredom in people with cancer has received little attention despite clinical observation, suggesting that it has the potential to affect patient's quality of life significantly. Passik et al. [9.Passik S. Inman A. Kirsch K. Initial validation of a scale to measure purposelessness, understimulation and boredom in cancer patients.Palliat Support Care. 2003; 1: 41-50Crossref PubMed Google Scholar] developed a Purposelessness, Understimulation and Boredom Scale to identify boredom and found this construct to be different from depression in the oncology setting. Multiple psychological measurement instruments have been described as useful in the diagnosis of depression in cancer patients. However, a single-item question: 'Have you been depressed, most of the day, nearly every day, for the past two weeks or more?' seems to be able to identify all cancer patients diagnosed as depressed using Research Diagnostic Criteria [10.Chochinov H.M. Wilson K.G. Enns M. are you depressed?' Screening for depression in the terminally ill.aM J Psychiatry. 1997; 154: 674-676Crossref PubMed Scopus (411) Google Scholar]. Suicide is associated with emotional suffering and, at times, with physical disease. Suicide has been reported to be 1.5–2 times higher in cancer patients than in the general population [11.Hem E. Loge J.H. Haldorsen T. et al.Suicide risk in cancer patients from 1960 to 1999.J Clin Oncol. 2004; 22: 4209-4216Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar]. among terminally ill patients with cancer, the request for euthanasia is about four times higher in patients with depression than in those without depression [12.Van der Lee M.L. van der Bom J.G. et al.Euthanasia and depression: a prospective cohort study among terminally ill cancer patients.J Clin Oncol. 2005; 23: 6607-6612Crossref PubMed Scopus (76) Google Scholar]. In addition, desire for death in terminally ill cancer patients is frequent. It has been shown to be associated with depression and is transitory [13.Chochinov H.M. Wilson K.G. Enns M. et al.Desire for death in the terminally ill.am J Psychiatry. 1995; 152: 1185-1191Crossref PubMed Scopus (563) Google Scholar]. Suicide risk protocols should include an evaluation of thoughts about death, dying and suicide, as well as an evaluation of the presence of a plan to commit suicide, the patient's intention to carry out such plan and its viability. an association between depression and an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. interleukin-1, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha) has been described.

      "abstract": "Nocturnal and sleep-related motor disorders in people with Parkinson's disease (PD) have a wide spectrum of manifestations and present a complex clinical picture. Problems can arise due to impaired movement ability (hypokinesias), e.g. nocturnal hypokinesia or early-morning akinesia, or to excessive movement (hyperkinesias), e.g. end-of-the-day dyskinesia, parasomnias, periodic limb movement during sleep and restless legs syndrome. These disorders can have a significant negative impact on the sleep, daytime functional ability, and overall quality of life of individuals with PD and their carers. The debilitating motor issues are often accompanied by a combination of non-motor symptoms, including pain and cramping, which add to the overall burden. Importantly, nocturnal motor disorders encompass a broader timeline than just the period of sleep, often starting in the evening, as well as occurring throughout the night and on awakening, and are not just limited to problems of insomnia or sleep fragmentation. Diagnosis can be challenging as, in many cases, the 'gold standard' assessment method is video polysomnography, which may not be available in all settings. Various validated questionnaires are available to support evaluation, and alternative approaches, using wearable sensors and digital technology, are now being developed to facilitate early diagnosis and monitoring. This review sets out the parameters of what can be considered normal nocturnal movement and describes the clinical manifestations, usual clinical or objective assessment methods, and evidence for optimal management strategies for the common nocturnal motor disorders that neurologists will encounter in people with PD in their clinical practice.",

The symptoms in melancholia being of a negative character due to a lowering or suspension of brain activity, we do not look for all those diversities, endless varieties and aspects which we may find in mania, be it simple, acute, or chronic. Generally there is an increased vitality, a state of hyperæsthesia, an increase in the activity of the brain, generally of the whole brain, and we must believe that these states will not so easily end in complete resolution as the condition of merely depressed action, or rather no action, which obtains in melancholia—I mean in melancholia generally, and not those states of acute melancholia which are supposed to be closely allied to the state which in other brains and under other subjective circumstances would give rise to mania from a pathological point of view. If this increased activity does not rapidly terminate in resolution, one of two things must occur—either exhaustion or atrophy, resulting in death or dementia, will supervene, or abnormal tissue will invade or replace healthy nerve paths or areas, and chronic aberration of mind ensue.",

      "abstract": "Serotonin syndrome is a potentially life-threatening adverse drug reaction that may occur following therapeutic drug use, inadvertent interactions between drugs, overdose of particular drugs, or the recreational use of certain drugs, It is most commonly reported with combinations of serotonergic medications. Serotonin syndrome is not an idiosyncratic drug reaction. methamphetamine is a psycho stimulant drug which produces increased wakefulness and focus in association with decreased fatigue and appetite. A methamphetamine overdose is rarely fatal but can lead to a number of different symptoms, including psychosis, chest pain, and hypertension. It is among agents with moderate potency to produce Serotonin syndrome. Here we present the first reported case of serotonin syndrome after a single ingestion of high dose methamphetamine (body staffer of 2gr amphetamine) in 28 year-old previously healthy man without any drug history, 2 hours prior to admission. Clinical manifestation included hyperthermia, hypertension, tachycardia, sweating, dilated pupil, agitation, overactive reflexes (greater in the lower limbs than in the upper limbs) and clonus. complete blood count was normal except for severely elevated white blood cell count of 22.3 ×103/µL (22.3 ×10 9 /L) with 74% neutrophils and 24% lymphocytes. His serum blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, liver function tests, and electrolytes were normal. Mildly elevation in Serum creatinine kinas was seen. Coagulation studies and Urine analysis were normal. Serum glucose was 210 mg/dL. An arterial blood gas shows respiratory alkalosis. We intubated him by Rapid Sequence Intubation (RSI) method and then took an emergent abdominal CT scan for any need for surgical intervention; we admitted him in ICU ward and did supportive care including the control of agitation, hyperthermia and autonomic instability. After 2 days we could extubate him and after 5days he discharged from hospital. clonus in moderate cases may be greater in the lower limbs than in the upper limbs. Mental status changes include hyper vigilance and agitation (1). Severe symptoms include severe increases in heart rate and blood pressure that may lead to shock. Temperature may rise to above 41.1 °C (106.0 °F) in life-threatening cases. Other abnormalities include metabolic acidosis, rhabdomyolysis, seizure, renal failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation; these effects usually arise as a consequence of hyperthermia (1,3).",

In addition, there has been some disappointment with the results of psychopharmacological approaches, particularly in the most severe mental health conditions. As such, the need to go beyond pharmacological treatment using other biological methods of therapy is of great value in the treatment of mental conditions. Some of these treatments are facilitated by the use of medical devices. In this chapter, we describe the most common medical devices that are used in mental health practice to which pharmacists have a role in their safe and effective use in practice. We describe devices that use electrically induced seizures such as electroconvulsive therapy and other noninvasive methods such as light therapy. In addition, wearable and nonwearable devices that are available in retail settings and point-of-care methods for monitoring psychopharmacological treatments are also included.",

This picture of an organic confusional state is said to result from high doses and prolonged therapy with corticosteroids and ACTH. The latter is recognized to cause psychiatric sequelae more often than the corticosteroids (Truelove and Witts, 1959).

E subdividida em cinco tipos: hebefrenica, paranoide, catatonica, residual e indiferenciada. Neste estudo abordaremos a Esquizofrenia Hebefrenica. A Esquizofrenia Hebefrenica, tambem conhecida como desorganizada, e caracterizada por uma acentuada regressao de comportamento, tendo como principais sinais e sintomas estao a infantilidade, discurso incoerente, enfraquecimento intelectual, perturbacao dos afetos, ideias delirantes, alucinacoes, pensamento desorganizado, gesticulacao exagerada, comportamento irresponsavel e imprevisivel, com tendencia ao isolamento social. Geralmente, comeca a ser percebida dos 15 aos 25 anos de idade. A causa ainda nao e totalmente definida, mas hoje sabe-se que se trata de uma doenca quimica cerebral que decorre de alteracoes nos varios sistemas bioquimicos, que sao os neurotransmissores, e vias neuronais cerebrais. Nessa conjuntura, o presente trabalho faz uma analise acerca do diagnostico de Esquizofrenia Hebefrenica de uma jovem assistida pelo Centro de Atencao Psicossocial Infanto Juventil de Imperatriz – MA e tem por objetivo conhecer o contexto da Esquizofrenia Hebefrenica, compreendendo os fatores que ocasionam influencia sobre a mesma, alem de conhecer a realidade da pessoa com Esquizofrenia Hebefrenica, bem como contexto familiar e alteracoes sociais que esta pode vim a causar, entender o processo de acompanhamento e tratamento da paciente realizado pela equipe multiprofissional do CAPS IJ, com destaque para a Enfermagem e elaborar problemas e intervencoes, visando a melhora na qualidade de vida da paciente. Desenvolvimento: O estudo realizado e descritivo, do tipo relato de caso, pois segundo Parente (2010), tem como caracteristica a descricao detalhada, contendo caracteristicas importantes sobre sinais, sintomas e outras caracteristicas do paciente e relata os procedimentos terapeuticos utilizados, bem como o deslanche do caso. A coleta de dados foi realizada no Centro de Atencao Psicossocial Infanto Juvenil - CAPS IJ, na cidade de Imperatriz – MA, no dia 27 de Setembro de 2017, com observacao da consulta de Enfermagem com a mae e revisao do prontuario da paciente, entrevista direta com a enfermeira e assistente social da unidade, e ainda com busca eletronica e literaria, incluindo artigos cientificos na lingua portuguesa, para uma abrangente revisao. Foi consultado o prontuario da mesma a fim de compreender as principais causas do ocorrido e propor intervencoes para melhor qualidade de vida. Para a construcao dos diagnosticos/problemas e intervencoes de enfermagem foi utilizado o NANDA 2015-2017 e NIC, para estudos de medicacoes utilizou-se o AME e manual da ANVISA. Resultados: Com a busca desenvolvida, acerca das informacoes e historico da paciente soube-se que a mesma possui 20 Anos, e estudante, reside na cidade de Imperatriz – MA, com pais divorciados e uma irma com 15 anos, foi diagnosticada em 2013, aos 15 anos, com Esquizofrenia Hebefrenica (CID 10 F20.1). A mae da paciente relata que teve parto normal de 7 meses, porem laborioso – ocorrido na recepcao do hospital, tendo em decorrencia deficiencia na oxigenacao cerebral (hipoxia neonatal) e convulsao. A paciente teve crescimento retardado, veio a andar apenas com 3 anos e falou as primeiras palavras com 4 anos de idade, mas apresentava boa socializacao. Apresenta retardo mental, relata a equipe multiprofissional do CAPSIJ que ouve vozes, ve um homem com capa preta, tem delirios, convulsoes, dificuldade no controle dos esfincteres, apresenta alteracoes na compreensao, alteracoes no humor, dificuldade motora, fala desconexa, em contexto fora da realidade, relata que nunca viu o pai, informacao que, segundo a mae, nao e verdadeira. Fala em namoro, mas de forma infantilizada, grita muito, nao tem paciencia em escutar, possui baixo nivel de atencao e gosta de pintar e ouvir musicas, se ocupando assim, por vezes, durante o dia inteiro. A paciente iniciou acompanhamento apos inicio dos primeiros sintomas na Associacao de Pais e Amigos dos Excepcionais – APAE, tendo de inicio as seguintes hipoteses diagnosticas: Epilepsia (CID 10 G40), Retardo Mental moderado (CID 10 F71), Transtornos Mentais e Comportamentais associados ao puerperio (CID 10 F53), Transtorno Psicotico Agudo e Transitorio (CID 10 F23) e Esquizofrenia (CID 10 F20). Em seguida foi encaminhada ao CAPS IJ onde em 2013, aos 15 anos, L.G.S foi diagnosticada com Esquizofrenia do tipo Hebefrenica (CID 10 F20.1) e iniciou acompanhamento e tratamento com  equipe multiprofissional da Unidade, com atendimentos psiquiatrico, com nutricionista, enfermeira, assistente social e psicologa, e atualmente tambem participa de oficinas de arte e teatro, que a paciente relata que gosta, mas tem aversao aos grupos de adolescentes, pois diz que sao mais velhos e a mesma prefere se relacionar com criancas. Atualmente, tendo 20 anos e com tratamento medicamentoso, acompanhamento com equipe multiprofissional e participacao em oficinas, obteve melhora do quadro, melhora na socializacao, o que possibilitou tambem diminuicao na medicacao, passando a ser iniciado com a mesma o processo de alta da Unidade de Atendimento, com comparecimento da paciente de 15 em 15 dias para interacao social e acompanhamento com a equipe ate que esteja pronta para a alta. Fez-se levantamento das medicacoes utilizadas pela paciente e de diagnosticos de Enfermagem, como: • Atividade de recreacao deficiente, caracterizado pelo tedio, relacionado a atividades de recreacao insuficientes. confusao aguda, controle de impulsos ineficaz, comunicacao verbal prejudicada•            Interacao social prejudicada, caracterizada por funcao social prejudicada, interacao disfuncional com outras pessoas, relacionado ao conhecimento insuficiente para de como fortalecer a reciprocidade, disturbio no autoconceito, isolamento terapeutico e processos de pensamento perturbados, sindrome de estresse por mudanca, risco de automutilacao e risco de violencia direcionada a si mesmo. Fez se tambem o levantamento de intervencoes, que foram: Aplicar arteterapia, praticar musicoterapia, estipular terapia socioambiental, utilizar brinquedos terapeuticos e administrar medicacao quando prescrito. Consideracoes Finais: Em suma, o referido estudo possibilitou como ferramenta fundamental para conhecimento na pratica em relacao as principais alteracoes e especificidades de um paciente com Esquizofrenia Hebefrenica, trazendo um olhar critico para a importância da equipe de enfermagem nos cuidados e acompanhamento do paciente acometido, assim abrindo a concepcao para uma analise sobre a patologia, alem disso, possibilitou a capacidade de realizar uma pesquisa cientifica em bases de dados e literaria, que e primordial para a formacao academica.",

Proprietary and open-source clinical examination tools are available, such as the Mini-Mental State Examination and the Mini-Cog. Physician judgment is necessary in selecting the most appropriate tool for an individual patient. These tools have varying sensitivity and specificity for neurologic and psychiatric disorders, but none are diagnostic for any mental status disorder. Each must be interpreted in the context of physician observation. The mental status examination is useful in helping differentiate between a variety of systemic conditions, as well as neurologic and psychiatric disorders ranging from delirium and dementia to bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. There are no guidelines to direct further testing in the setting of an abnormal mental status examination; therefore, testing is based on clinical judgment.",

However, the multiple etiologies of the various types of abnormal movement disorders suggest that even though their presenting symptoms might be similar, different drug‐induced movement disorders should not be treated with the same medication.",

These include depression, anxiety, pathological laughter and crying pseudobulbar affect, mania, euphoria, psychosis, bipolar disorder, fatigue and cognitive impairment. Anti‐parkinsonian treatment is likely to increase psychiatric comorbidity. Indeed treatment‐linked prolonged cognitive processing may be a harbinger of more disabling morbidity, like deficits in attention, multitasking and difficulties in sequencing and planning.

      "abstract": "Auditory hallucinations can be experienced in the context of many different disorders and syndromes. The differential diagnosis basically rests on the presence or absence of accompanying symptoms. In terms of clinical relevance, the most important distinction to be made is between auditory hallucinations occurring in the context of psychotic disorders and those that are due to a somatic disorder. Auditory hallucinations are also quite common in otherwise healthy individuals and are therefore not necessarily disease-related. As auditory hallucinations are often accompanied by hallucinations in other modalities, pinpointing the modality in which hallucinations are experienced most frequently may provide a first – albeit coarse – indication of whether the auditory hallucinations are part of a neurological disorder (mainly visual), a psychiatric disorder (mainly auditory), an ear disorder (mainly auditory) or whether they occur in the absence of any disorder (mainly auditory). Epilepsy is the most important exception to this coarse differentiation. Another traditional distinction between hallucinations occurring in the context of neurological and psychiatric disorders is that the former are assumed to start at an advanced age, whereas hallucinations in the context of psychiatric disorders typically begin in late adolescence or early adulthood. Although there are many exceptions to this rule of thumb – as in psychotic depression, late-onset schizophrenia and epilepsy – age of onset can still be a valuable clinical indicator. The content of auditory hallucinations is notoriously unreliable for differential diagnosis and the safest way to an accurate diagnosis rests with the detection of psychiatric and somatic comorbid symptoms.",

The schizophrenia clinical picture is usually misunderstood by the general public and consists of positive symptoms, negative symptoms, disorganized speech or behavior during a specific amount of time.

Residual cognitive effects were observed in some but not in all tests after prolonged heavy cannabis use. The effects were mostly mild. The relationship of cannabis use, psychotic effects and schizophrenia was unclear; the cannabis conceivably gave relief, but it also appeared that cannabis caused schizophrenia in young people and (or) enhanced the symptoms, especially in young people poorly able to cope with stress or in whom the antipsychotic therapy was unsuccessful.",

Acute psychosis is primary if it is symptomatic of a psychiatric disorder, or secondary if caused by a specific medical condition. Patients with primary psychiatric disorders are likely to have auditory hallucinations, prominent cognitive disorders, and complicated delusions. If psychosis is caused by a medical condition, the patient may exhibit cognitive changes and abnormal vital signs, and may have visual hallucinations. Illicit drug use is the most common medical cause of acute psychosis. Clinicians should ask about recent head injury or trauma, seizures, cerebrovascular disease, or new or worsening headaches. A subacute onset of psychosis should raise suspicion for an oncologic cause. Collateral history from family members is helpful in establishing the presentation and course of the illness. The physical examination should include complete neurologic and mental status assessments. Tachycardia or severe hypertension may indicate drug toxicity or thyrotoxicosis; fever may suggest encephalitis or porphyria. Suggested initial laboratory tests include a complete blood count, metabolic profile, thyroid function tests, urine toxicology, and measurement of parathyroid hormone, calcium, vitamin B12, folate, and niacin. Testing for human immunodeficiency virus infection and syphilis should also be considered. Prompt recognition of the etiology of psychosis may improve treatment, consultation, and prognosis.",

O adoecimento psiquico tem se tornado cada vez mais presente na atualidade, onde os Transtornos Depressivos e Bipolar aparecem como diagnostico. Como caracteristicas principais do Transtorno Bipolar, temos a presenca de um periodo proeminente e persistente de humor anormalmente elevado, expansivo ou irritavel e de atividade ou energia anormalmente aumentada, podendo ser classificado como mania ou hipomania, dependendo de sua gravidade e da presenca de sintomas psicoticos.Ainda, tambem faz parte do diagnostico os sinais da depressao que, por sua vez, podem ser identificados por: humor deprimido na maior parte do dia; diminuicao do interesse ou do prazer em atividades diarias; sentimento de tristeza, desesperanca e choro constante; alteracao de peso; insonia ou sono em excesso; agitacao ou reducao de atividades psicomotoras; sensacao de fadiga; sentimentos de inutilidade ou de culpa; diminuicao da concentracao; e pensamentos suicidas. O DSM 5 trara o tipo conforme o tempo e intensidade dos sintomas apresentados. Em relacao aos Transtornos Depressivos apresentam as mesmas caracteristicas que o episodio depressivo, presente no Transtorno Bipolar, acompanhado de alteracoes somaticas e cognitivas que afetam significativamente a capacidade de funcionamento do individuo. O que difere entre eles sao os aspectos de duracao, momento ou etiologia presumida. E relevante destacar a importância de um diagnostico correto, para tratamento dos Transtornos que, na maioria das vezes, e realizado atraves de tratamento medicamentoso e psicoterapia.Ainda, ressaltamos que a elucidacao e a compreensao desses transtornos sao fundamentais, sendo que, quanto mais precoce for o diagnostico, possivelmente, melhor sera o prognostico.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Abstract CNS deficiency of 5-hydroxytryplamine (serotonin) has been implicated as a biochemical basis in some forms of depression. Existing drug modalities for treating depression include some with serotonergic effects. Studies suggest that psychedelic drugs are also serotonergic, This may indicate a role for psychedelics in the treatment of depression. Such treatment has already been attempted using psychedelic drugs in both the indoleamine and phenylalkylamine categories. Encouraging results seem to recommend further research, with special emphasis on drugs in the phenylisopropylamine subgroup of phenylalkylamines that are only peripherally psychedelic. Certain of these, called entactogens or empathogens, cause substantially less distortion of normative consciousness than classic psychedelics, such as LSD or mescaline. They could therefore be more easily assimilated into existing psychotherapy approaches, where their function would be to enhance the normal psychotherapeutic process rather than serving a maintenance role as chemoth erapeutic agents. Their usefulness in such an application would be mainly at the start of psychotherapy in order to (1) reduce the client's \"fear response\" that often inhibits ability to deal with repressed traumatic material; (2) facilitate the client's interpersonal communications with the therapist, spouse or significant others; and (3) accelerate formation of a therapeutic alliance between client and therapist.

Another serious medical complication arising from drug abuse is the withdrawal syndrome, which manifests during abstinence from the drug. Stimulant drugs are a diverse group of chemicals that act primarily through activation of the sympathetic nervous system. They are sometimes referred to as sympathomimetics. In small to moderate doses, they result in an elevated mood, increased energy and alertness, and decreased appetite. During intoxication, they have profound CNS, cardiovascular system, and metabolic effects. In moderate doses, cocaine produces arousal and euphoria but also anxiety and restlessness. Acute intoxication may result in severe psychiatric disturbances, such as acute anxiety, panic attacks, delirium, or acute psychosis.",

      "title": "Physical activity, participation and health-related quality of life in chronic fatigue syndrome and multiple osteochondromas",
      "abstract": "WSAS Work and Social Adjustment ScaleChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is, according to the CDC-1994 criteria, a disorder characterized by unexplained, persistent or relapsing fatigue of a new or definite onset, which is present for at least six months.The fatigue is not the result of exertion, is not alleviated by rest and leads to a significant reduction in previous levels of occupational, educational, social and personal activities.In addition, the fatigue has to be accompanied by at least four of the following symptoms, which have to be present for at least six months: impaired short-term memory or concentration, sore throat, tender cervical or axillary lymph nodes, muscles pain, pain in several joints, headache of a new type, pattern or severity, unrefreshing sleep or post-exertional malaise lasting more than 24 hours [6].Besides the CDC-1994 criteria [6], over 20 other case definitions have been developed with differences in main symptoms, inclusion and exclusion criteria [14,15].Consequently, these case definitions vary in sensitivity and specificity, but consensus on a uniform case definition has not been reached.Since the CDC-1994 case definition is the most frequently cited and most extensively validated [14], this case definition will be used throughout this thesis to define CFS.Estimates of prevalence rates vary in relation to case definitions and study designs [16,17], and range between 0.2% -2.2% for developed countries [16][17][18].The total prevalence of CFS in Europe is estimated around 2 million [19].CFS is 1.5 to 2 times more prevalent in women than men [16,17] and is most common in young adults with its peak at 20-40 years of age [16].Information on incidence rates is even more scarce and is estimated at 15/100.000adults per year in de United Kingdom [18].Limited attention has been given to the societal impact of CFS in Europe [19], but a significant economic burden has been identified due to both direct as indirect or hidden costs.Direct costs encompass mainly various medical costs, and indirect costs consist of occupational limitations (productivity loss, absenteeism, work incapacity) and nonmedical, often hidden costs such as informal care given by the patient's social context CFS can be considered a non-specific disorder characterized by chronic fatigue that may be accompanied by chronic pain.The aetiology of MO is clear and, consequently, MO can be classified as a specific disorder explaining the localized (nociceptive) pain due to the structural deformities.However, as with many chronic disorders, the pathophysiology of chronic fatigue and chronic pain remains not fully understood.The pathophysiology of chronic fatigue and chronic pain complaints is hypothesized to be multifactorial and can differ depending on the underlying disease [42][43][44].This thesis is particularly interested in the impact of chronic fatigue in patients who also experience chronic pain.environmental and personal factors can either be facilitating or restricting [49].As presented by the ICF (Figure 1), all concepts are inseparable and insight into the association between all concepts is necessary to clarify the impact of CFS and MO (health condition) on a person's physical activity level (PAL), activities, participation and HRQOL. Outline of this thesisPart 1: Assessment of (physical) limitations and restrictions in chronic fatigue syndrome In order to explore HRQOL and physical activity in patients with chronic fatigue, the first aim of the present thesis is to identify reliable and valid measurement instruments for measuring these constructs.A large number of measurement instruments for measuring HRQOL and physical activity are available.Even though research regarding HRQOL and physical activity has been performed in patients with chronic fatigue, and more specifically patients with CFS, consensus on the psychometric characteristics of these measurement instruments in patients with CFS is lacking.Consequently, it is unclear which measurement instruments are most suited to use in research, but also in clinical practice.In patients with MO, insufficient research regarding patients' HRQOL and no research on their PAL has been performed.The investigation and selection of appropriate and suitable measurement instruments was based on previous research results in patients with CFS, since the primary diagnostic criterium in CFS is chronic fatigue; this group is therefore a valid representation of patients with chronic fatigue.A systematic review of the literature and critical appraisal of the psychometric properties of identified measurement instruments measuring HRQOL and physical activity in patients with CFS was deemed necessary as a starting point to address the overall aim of the present thesis.The results of the systematic review on measurement instruments to assess activity limitations and participation restrictions in patients with CFS are described in chapter 2. The results of the systematic review on the psychometric assessment of measurement instruments to evaluate the physical activity level and pattern in patients with CFS are described in chapter 3.Both objective measures and self-report measures are often used to assess a person's PAL.Objective measures fairly accurately estimate patients' actual PAL in terms of activity intensity, but most currently used measures do not take environmental and contextual factors into account and they do not provide a detailed overview of the kind of activities patients perform.This information would provide more insight in patients' meaningful activities of daily living and would help to tailor activity management programs to each patient's individual needs.Self-report measures could provide this information, but previous studies have shown that current self-report measures are not capable of measuring patients' actual PAL [79][80][81].Therefore, a measurement instrument (activity diary) that addresses the limitations of previously used self-report measures was developed and it was investigated whether the activity diary could accurately estimate patients' actual PAL by comparing it to an objective measure.Chapter 4 evaluates the ability of the activity diary to estimate the actual PAL in patients with CFS and explores which factors explain the discrepancy between the objective and self-report measure of physical activity.

      "abstract": "Narcolepsy is an emblematic, unique disease within sleep disorders that is characterised by excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy and other abnormal manifestations of REM sleep. In the last 14 years truly spectacular progress has been made in our knowledge of this disease, since the discovery of its cause, i.e. a loss of the hypothalamic neurons that synthesise hypocretin, a previously unknown neurotransmitter, and its probable aetiopathogenic mechanisms, i.e. an autoimmune process in a patient with very precise immunological characteristics - a specific type of HLA and a specific type of T-cell receptor. The cause of this autoimmune process remains unknown. The definitive treatment - the administration of hypocretin, which is the substance missing in the organism - is still unavailable, but there are powerful drugs for treating its main symptoms, the sleepiness and the cataplexy. Some of these are classic compounds (methylphenidate, clomipramine), while others are more recent (modafinil, venlafaxine, sodium oxybate), but together they allow many patients to experience significant improvements. Lack of knowledge about the disease, both on the part of patients and their relatives as well as physicians, is the reason for the great delay in its diagnosis, with even more dramatic consequences when the disease begins in infancy.",

To be most effective, insomnia treatment should be tailored to resolving underlying causes of the condition and managing specific sleep complaints. Therefore, hypnotic therapy administered prior to bedtime, as is currently recommended for most compounds, is not appropriate for all insomnia patients. Ideally, behavioral interventions should be combined with a rapid-acting agent that can be administered at virtually any time during the night without producing residual effects the following day. Zaleplon, a new non-benzodiazepine sleep medication, provides the clinician with an effective and safe pharmacotherapeutic option for insomnia management. Its rapid rates of absorption and elimination allow for treatment of symptoms when they occur, either at bedtime or later at night, without incurring significant risk for the development of next-day impairment of psychomotor and cognitive functioning.",

      "title": "Prolonged coma after anesthesia",
      "abstract": "Anesthesiologists are pretty much the only doctors who induce controlled and reversible coma medically in their daily practice. The word “coma” derived from a Greek word “Koma” signifies a state of sleep. In medical terms it is defined as a state of unresponsiveness from which the patient cannot be aroused.[1] Therefore any delayed recovery is viewed as anesthetic problem. Delayed recovery from anesthesia or coma after anesthesia is a major anesthetic complication. The causes for delayed recovery from anesthesia are many. They are patient, surgical, anesthetic, and pharmacological factors. The pharmacological factors include the use of various anesthetic and adjuvant drugs, and their interactions with other drugs, known or unknown. This depends upon the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, context sensitive half-lives, amount of drug administered, accidental administration, co-administration with other drugs etc. The patient factors such as the extremes of age, obesity, and various co-morbidities like the cardiovascular, renal, liver or other major organ dysfunction can potentiate the effects of the drug used. Some of the rare causes are myxoedema coma, drug toxicity and Addison's disease. However the delayed recovery due to anesthetic causes, excluding hypoxia, usually lasts for a few hours to days.[1] In the case report published in this issue, the coma lasted for >4 weeks. The authors have eliminated most of the causes of delayed recovery from anesthesia. However the hypoglycemia was detected in the postoperative period when the patient did not recover from anesthesia. The history obtained later revealed that the patient had taken long acting insulin in the preoperative period. The blood sugar level on the morning of surgery was borderline. No blood sugar was estimated during the entire surgical procedure. These factors could have led to profound and prolonged undetected hypoglycemia, which could have led to delayed recovery. Hypoglycemia of prolonged duration (>30 min) leads to neuroglycopenia and brain damage.[2] The symptoms depend on level of blood glucose and also on time taken to detect and correct hypoglycemia. Even after correcting hypoglycemia, prolonged coma is observed in critical care units. It can produce a variety of symptoms and effects, but the principal problem arising from an inadequate supply of glucose to the brain is impairment of function (neuroglycopenia). Effects can range from mild dysphoria to more serious issues such as seizures, unconsciousness, and (rarely) permanent brain damage and death.[3] Plasma glucose levels are maintained between 4 and 8 mmol/L (72–144 mg/dl) throughout the 24 hours. 3.3-3.9 mmol/L (60-70 mg/dl) is cited as lower limit of blood glucose. However hypoglycemic symptoms do not occur till 2.8-3.0 mmol/L (50-54 mg/dl) of plasma glucose. Under anesthesia hypoglycemic symptoms are not detected. In the case presented the blood glucose level 5 h after preoperative value was 2.2 mmol/L (40 mg/dl). To detect hypoglycemia causing brain damage electroencephalography (EEG) and diffusion-weighted imaging of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are useful, both in detection and prognostication. EEG shows theta waves and lambda waves with definite slowing, flat and burst suppression patterns. In this case the EEG changes observed point to hypoglycemia as the factor leading to delayed recovery. There have been reports of hyper-intense signal intensities in diffusion-weighted (DW) MRI in hypoglycemia.[4] Recently different patterns of DW MRI findings involving the internal capsules, corona radiata and frontoparietal cortex in a patient who recovered from prolonged hypoglycemic coma without neurological deficit have been observed. Therefore, this particular modality might have been useful in diagnosis and prognostication.[5] Volatile anesthetics have been found to produce neuroprotection in various paradigms. The preconditioning by these agents partially protects perirhinal cortex and striatal dependent functions against moderate to severe neonatal hypoxia-ischemia.[6] Although previous morphological data have suggested that cells die by necrosis, experimental research showed neuronal damage after hypoglycemia has features of apoptosis.[7] After exclusion of organic and pharmacological causes, coma may be attributed to a dissociative stupor. Reported delays in return to consciousness span time periods from 2 to 30 h, and longer periods of amnesia thereafter. There are four reports in the literature; each excluded other pathology with extensive examination, laboratory tests and radiological imaging. One individual experienced this phenomenon on three separate occasions after tracheal stenosis repairs.[89] Conclusion Delayed recovery is usually multifactorial. In the present case report, it looks more like prolonged hypoglycemia leading to delayed recovery. A differential diagnosis of dissociative stupor can be considered when other causes are excluded. The lesson one has to learn as a perioperative physician is to assess the patient thoroughly and investigate according to the need and evidence. An arterial blood gas and blood sugar estimation are needed in prolonged surgeries with multiple co-morbidities particularly in obese individuals.

Most commonly, it is used to denote a condition in which stimulation in one sensory modality also gives rise to an experience in a different modality. However, conditions involving different qualities within one modality (e.g., when the sight of letter shapes evokes color) are labeled synesthesia as well. Phenomena of this sort have also been reported in patients with eye disease, brain damage, and migraines (e.g., Armel &amp; Ramachandran, 1999; Jacobs, Karpik, Bozian &amp; Gothgen, 1981; Podoll &amp; Robinson, 2002). Similar experiences have been reported in healthy individuals using mescaline and LSD (e.g., Hartman &amp; Hollister, 1963) or drinking psychoactive brews such as Ayahuasca (Shanon, 2002). Divine intervention has also been invoked as a possible trigger of synesthesia.",

A number of clinical syndromes are described and their differential diagnosis considered. The clinical picture will usually change as the child grows older. Laboratory investigations including EEG. are not helpful. At whatever age the schizophrenic child is seen, the following difficulties are most likely to be encountered: 1) Lack of firm self-identity, disturbed body image and lack of clear ego boundaries. This may be directly apparent or may be determined by the use of projective methods or drawings. These difficulties constitute the core problem and are essential to the diagnosis. 2) Dereistic feeling, thinking and behaviour. 3) The simultaneous presence of impaired and precocious psychological functioning. 4) A loss of normal interests or the appearance of unusual or regressive ones. 5) Language disturbances in content or in rhythm, intonation, pitch, stress or volume. 6) Deficient social relationships with impaired capacity to empathize and a tendency to withdrawal. Certainty about individual identity and what lies outside and inside the ego is essential for normal relationships. Awareness of the changing clinical features of childhood schizophrenia and careful examination for basic problems in identity and distinction of internal and external reality will help in arriving at a diagnosis.",

With some drug like cocaine, stroke appear to be the result of a direct effect. In young subjects without other risk factors provide persuasive evidence for causality . OPIATES: Heroine is the most abused opiate drug, which is administered by injection, by snorting or by smoking. Stroke affects heroin users by diverse mechanisms,. Injectors are at risk of infections endocarditis, which carries risk for both ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke. Cerebral or subarachnoid hemorrhage usually occurs after rupture of a septic (mycotic) aneurysm. Heroine users can are also at risk for hemorrhagic stroke secondary to liver failure with deranged clotting and to heroin nephropathy with uremia or malignant hypertension. In some heroin users the drug it self is directly causal due to vasculitis, hypersensitivity and immunologic changes. Embolization of foreign material to brain due to mixed of heroine with quinine can cause cerebral embolism. AMPHETAMINE AND other psychostimulants: In abuser of amphetamine hemorrhagic stroke can occur, oral, intravenous, nasal, and inhalational routes of administration have been reported. Most were chronic user, but in several patients, stroke followed a first exposure. Some of amphetamine induced intracranial hemorrhages are secondary to acute hypertension, some to cerebral vacuities, and some to a combination of two. Decongestants and diet pills: Phenylpropanolamine (PPA), an amphetamine – like drug, in decongestants and diet pills, induce acute hypertension, sever headache, psychiatric symptoms, seizures and hemorrhagic stroke. Ephedrine and pseudo ephedrine are present in decongestants and bronchodilators and induce headache, tachyarrhythmia, hypertensive emergency, and hemorrhagic and occlusive stroke. Ecstasy, 3,4 Methylenedioxymethamphetamin (MDMA) with amphetamine like can induce ischemic or hemorrhagic strokes. Crack cocaine: medical complication of crack cocaine is stroke. Parenteral cocaine users are at risk of stroke related to infectious endocarditis and also experience stroke caused directly by the drug itself.",

The term somnolence describes a drowsy patient who responds to mild stimulus (such as voice), and mumbles incoherently and moves in a disorganized fashion. In contrast, a stuporous patient responds to a vigorous and continuous stimulus only, and upon discontinuation of a stimulus returns to an unresponsive state. Coma is a state of complete unresponsiveness, from which a patient cannot be aroused.",

      "title": "Gambling Dual Disorder: A Dual Disorder and Clinical Neuroscience Perspective",
      "abstract": "Several behaviors, including compulsive gambling, have been considered non-substance-related addictive disorders. Categorical mental disorders (e.g., DSM-5) are usually accompanied by very different symptomatic expressions (affective, behavioral, cognitive, substance abuse, personality traits). When these mental disorders occur with addictive disorders, either concomitantly or sequentially over the life span, this clinical condition is called a dual disorder. Gambling disorder (GD) has been associated with other categorical psychiatric diagnoses: attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, depression, bipolar disorder, social anxiety, schizophrenia, substance use disorder, antisocial personality disorder; and dimensional symptoms including higher impulsivity, poorer emotional wellbeing, cognitive distortion, psychosis, deficient self-regulation, suicide, poorer family environment, and greater mental distress. We are calling this clinical condition Gambling Dual Disorder. From a clinical perspective, it is clear that Gambling Dual Disorder is not the exception but rather the expectation, and this holds true not just for GD, but also for other mental disorders including other addictions. Mental disorders are viewed as biological disorders that involve brain circuits that implicate specific domains of cognition, emotion, and behavior. This narrative review presents the state of the art with respect to GD in order to address current matters from a dual disorder, precision psychiatry, and clinical neuroscience perspective, rather than the more subjective approach of symptomatology and clinical presentation. This review also presents Gambling Dual Disorder as a brain and neurodevelopmental disorder, including from the perspectives of evolutionary psychiatry, genetics, impulsivity as an endophenotype, the self-medication hypothesis, and sexual biological differences. The wide vision of the disease advances a paradigm shift, highlighting how GD and dual disorders should be conceptualized, diagnosed, and treated. Rethinking GD as part of a dual disorder is crucial for its appropriate conceptualization from the perspective of clinical neuroscience and precision psychiatry.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia may be categorized as difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakening, early awakenings or a combination of each. The ideal hypnotic must promote rapid sleep onset and maintain sleep throughout the night while allowing the patient to awake refreshed the following day. Several benzodiazepines, with differing pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles are presently available. All are clinically effective and not only elimination half-life but also dosage prescribed and pattern of distribution are important factors for determining treatment response. Hypnotics have been divided into those with long elimination half-lives (e.g. nitrazepam, flunitrazepam, flurazepam), those with intermediately long half-lives (brotizolam, loprazolam, lormetazepam, temazepam) and those with short half-lives (midazolam and triazolam). Carry-over effects into the morning such as excessive daytime sleepiness or drowsiness are related to drug half-life, dosage and pattern of distribution. In equipotent dosages most controlled clinical trials have found no significant differences between the various benzodiazepine hypnotics. Nevertheless, clinicians in general tend to use long half-life benzodiazepines in patients who have difficulties maintaining sleep and short half-life benzodiazepines for treating sleep onset insomnia. Intermediately long half-life, benzodiazepines are used for both indications and most clinicians feel that the choice of hypnotic should not only be influenced by elimination half-life or the dosage used, but by individual patient preference. Hypnotics should be used for only short periods of time and in those patients for whom a more chronic use is indicated, they should be used only on an intermittent basis.",

      "title": "Neurobiological and Molecular Bases of Methamphetamine-Induced Behavioral Sensitization and Spontaneous Recurrence of Methamphetamine Psychosis, and its Implication in Schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Spontaneous recurrence of methamphetamine- or amphetamine-induced paranoid hallucinatory psychosis (i.e., flashbacks) occasionally occurs in response to non-specific mild stress in drug-free patients with a history of methamphetamine- or amphetamine-induced psychosis. Stress sensitization associated with noradrenergic hyperactivity and increased dopamine release may be related to this flashbacks. Stressful frightening experiences as well as fear-related paranoid- hallucinatory states during methamphetamine use may be related to these stress sensitization. Robust noradrenergic hyperactivity with increased dopamine release may predicts subsequent flashback episodes. Schizophrenia-like symptoms (e.g., passivity phenomena, Gedankenlautwerden, and thought disorder such as circumstantiality and egorrhea symptoms) appear to develop related to dopaminergic hyperactivity. One of the dopamine receptor-encoding genes DRD2, TaqIA A1/A1 type, with which reduced density of the D2 receptor is associated, reduces to the risk of development of flashbacks. Stress sensitization has been proposed as a key step in the progression from vulnerability to an overt paranoidhallucinatory states, so that schizophrenia and flashbacks due to previous methamphetamine psychosis shares common underlying mechanisms of stress sensitization. Compared to flashbacks due to previous methamphetamine psychosis, psychedelic drug flashbacks are the recurrence of a perception learned while an individual is experiencing high anxiety levels, and thus recur in anxiety-related situations. Anxiety or fear during drug use is an important factor in the development of flashbacks due to previous methamphetamine psychosis and also psychedelic drug flashbacks. Dopaminergic and glutamatergic neural circuits including the striatum, nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex play an important role in the development of psychostimulant-induced long-lasting behavioral sensitization. Immediate early genes expression in the particular brain regions affected by the psychostimulants is involved in this process. Furthermore, recent advances in molecular analysis could shed light on the fundamental mechanism involved, by identifying specific participating molecules such as delta FosB, NAC1, G-protein b1 subunit and methamphetamine-responsive transcript 1b.

      "abstract": "Fentanyl is an opioid usually used in general anaesthesia, due to which it is also called an analgesic drug. These drugs can relieve the pain within the body by blocking the neurotransmitters or chemicals that cause pain in the body. Opioids can work in both the ascending pathways of the brain as well as the descending pathways of the brain for pain modulation. Fentanyl is more potent than morphine and herion. Fentanyl is also given as transdermal patches or lozenges in the treatment of pain management. Fentanyl is also sold illegally and can cause of death too when abused. Because of its strong property to be addicted, fentanyl also is mixed with the heroine. Moreover, fentanyl has its own effects during withdrawal, which causes behaviour changes. Fentanyl can bind to μ-opioid receptors (MORs) to exert its effects. In addition, fentanyl abuse is becoming more common globally. Fentanyl causes the brain to suffocate by decreasing the oxygen supply, causing hypoxia and hyperglycemia as well. Fentanyl abuse can cause serious cognitive issues, leading to severe structural damage manifested as hormonal and neuronal disturbances. By suppressing the two brainstem areas, opioids cause disturbances to breathing.",

      "abstract": "To review current knowledge on blood pressure variability.Blood pressure variability has a time-course ranging from a few seconds or minutes (short-term variability) to 24 h (long-term variability) or 1 year (seasonal variations). The variability is influenced by physiological factors such as physical and mental activity (posture, exercise, talking) or behavioral and environmental factors (salt, caffeine, alcohol), and by pathological conditions. In patients with essential hypertension, the day-night pattern of blood pressure change is generally similar to that of normotensives, with a significant nocturnal blood pressure fall (dippers), except that the entire profile is shifted upwards. Nevertheless, in some essential hypertensives the nocturnal fall in blood pressure is absent or reversed (non-dippers), in spite of a decrease in the nocturnal heart rate. In several forms of secondary hypertension (pheochromocytoma, renal failure) and other clinical conditions (sleep apnea syndrome, diabetes mellitus, cardiac transplantation) the nocturnal fall in blood pressure is also absent or reversed.Blood pressure variability and the blunted nocturnal fall in blood pressure may be clinically relevant. Several studies have demonstrated that subjects whose 24-h variability was higher than the group average were more likely to have target-organ damage. Moreover, hypertensive women with a blunted nocturnal fall in blood pressure (non-dippers) are more likely to suffer morbid cardiovascular events than dippers. On theoretical grounds, therefore, antihypertensive treatment that reduces blood pressure variability and preserves the nocturnal fall in blood pressure will help to protect target organs in hypertension. So far, this has not been demonstrated in clinical trials.",

      "title": "Neurological complications of psychiatric drugs: clinical features and management",
      "abstract": "This paper reviews the main neurological complications of psychiatric drugs, in particular antipsychotics and antidepressants. Extrapyramidal syndromes include acute dystonia, parkinsonism, akathisia, tardive dyskinesia and tardive dystonia. Extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) are less frequent with atypical than with conventional antipsychotics but remain common in clinical practice partly due to lack of screening by health professionals. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) consists of severe muscle rigidity, pyrexia, change in conscious level and autonomic disturbance but partial forms also occur. NMS is particularly associated with the initiation and rapid increase in dose of high-potency antipsychotics but it has been reported with all the atypical antipsychotics and rarely with other drugs including antidepressants. Serotonin toxicity comprises altered mental state (agitation, excitement, confusion), neuromuscular hyperactivity (tremor, clonus, myoclonus, hyper-reflexia) and autonomic hyperactivity and occurs on a spectrum. Severe cases, termed serotonin syndrome, usually follow the co-prescription of drugs that increase serotonergic transmission by different pathways, for example a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI) and a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Most antipsychotics and antidepressants lower the seizure threshold and can cause seizures; the risk is greater with clozapine than with other atypical antipsychotics and greater with tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) than with SSRIs. In randomised controlled trials in elderly patients with dementia atypical antipsychotics are associated with a higher risk of stroke and death than placebo. Cohort studies suggest that conventional drugs carry at least the same risk. Cessation of treatment with antipsychotics and antidepressants can lead to a wide range of discontinuation symptoms which include movement disorders and other neurological symptoms. Clinicians need to be familiar with strategies to reduce the risk of these adverse events and to manage them when they arise. Their occurrence needs to be balanced against the benefits of psychiatric drugs in terms of efficacy and improved quality of life in a range of disorders. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

This is the format of most traditional classifications of sleep disorders. A modern classification has been introduced in 1990 and contains the description of 88 different sleep disturbances. They are classified in the main categories of dyssomnia, parasomnia and sleep disorders associated with psychiatric, neurological or somatic conditions. This classification is an excellent tool for the practice of sleep medicine and for the study of sleep disorders.",

      "abstract": "The new DSM-5 has a number of changes to addictions and substance-related disorders. Internet Gaming for instance is a “Condition for Further Study”. This means that it is not an “official” disorder in the DSM, but one on which the American Psychiatric Association request additional research. The DSM diagnostic criteria for addictions to the X-subject generally include: – repetitive use of X, that leads to significant issues with functioning; – preoccupation or obsession with X; – craving/withdrawal symptoms when not dealing with X; – the person has tried to stop or curb X, but has failed to do so; – the person has had a loss of interest in other life activities, such as hobbies; – a person has had continued overuse of X even with the knowledge of how much they impact a person's life; – the person uses X to relieve anxiety related to other issues; – the person has lost or put at risk and opportunity or relationship because of X. I suggest that some sport fans may: – meet the above mentioned criteria; – be subject to over-identification with “their team performances”, superstitious conditioning and loss of self-consciousness that may lead to a full blown addictive syndrome, along with comorbidity with pathological gambling. This seems particularly true in Italy, for example, as far as the phenomenon of ultra football supporters is concerned. I argue that further research might be needed to explore the psycho-social consequences of obsessive sport addiction and how this may impact on a person's overall functioning.",

Hinzu kommen die Sedierung, mögliche Sedierungslücken und ganz allgemein die medizinische Behandlung. Teilweise kann dies von den Patienten nur schlecht verarbeitet werden. Einzelne oder mehrere dieser Faktoren können bei vorbestehender Disposition oder unzureichendem Coping zu einer Vielzahl psychiatrischer Erkrankungen führen. Herausgegriffen werden im folgenden Artikel Schlafstörungen, Anpassungsstörungen, Depressionen sowie das Spektrum der Angsterkrankungen (v.a. Generalisierte Angststörung und Panikattacken), zu denen im amerikanischen Diagnosemanual DSM-IV-R auch die akute Belastungsstörung und die posttraumatische Belastungsstörung zählen. Die genannten Erkrankungen können nicht nur auf der Intensivstation sondern auch nach der Verlegung auf die Normalstation auftreten. In unseren eigenen Untersuchungen wurde der Wechsel von der \"Rundumversorgung\" zur \"Normalversorgung\" von den Patienten häufig als belastend erlebt. Oftmals erscheinen die Symptome zu Beginn unspezifisch und nur schwer kategorisierbar, daher werden zunächst einige psychopathologische Leitsymptome beschrieben und die entsprechenden Differentialdiagnosen dargestellt. Neben dem genauen Erheben des psychopathologischen Befundes sind auch eine umfassende (psychiatrische) Anamnese und die Beobachtung des Verlaufs wichtig um eine genaue Diagnose zu stellen. Da neben dem individuellen Leid sowohl der weitere Verlauf der somatischen Erkrankung als auch die Rehabilitation beeinträchtigt wird und die Störungen bei fehlender Therapie zur Chronifizierung neigen, ist eine frühzeitige Diagnose durch die Kooperation von Intensivmedizinern und Psychiatern von essentieller Bedeutung. Der folgende Artikel informiert über Prävalenz, Ätiologie und Risikofaktoren, Klinik, Diagnostik und Therapie.",

      "abstract": "Flunitrazepam, widely known by its trade names (e.g. Rohypnol), may cause severe violence, especially in combination with alcohol. Flunitrazepam abusers become cold-blooded, ruthless and violent, and do not remember their violence. Reputedly it is supplied to professional hit-men and enforcers by their bosses to promote ruthless efficacy. One case report describes how a young man, intoxicated with flunitrazepam and involved in causing serious knife and gunshot wounds and taking hostages, felt so invincible that he openly challenged the police, threatening them with an assault rifle, but was himself shot. Flunitrazepam may exert pharmacological effects on GABA-ergic systems, thus lowering serotonin levels. The impulsive execution of violent crimes and suicide attempts in which a violent method (hanging, shooting, self-stabbing) has been used are associated with the presence of low serotonin levels. It is therefore recommended that flunitrazepam should be classified as a controlled substance in Sweden as it is elsewhere.",

Treatment options are thus limited to symptomatic presentations and strive to relieve patients and caregivers of some of the behavioral and psychiatric sequelae that can severely impact the quality of life. In fact, neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia affect virtually all patients with dementia at some time during the disease course and are associated with earlier institutionalization, increased caregiving costs (both financial and otherwise), and worsened disease progression. Unfortunately, pharmacological measures acting on neurocircuitry that may be damaged in the brains of patients with dementia as well as attempts to utilize non-pharmacological, cognition-acting strategies in cognitively impaired patients with dementia may not be as effective as they are for younger, non-demented patients. It is also important to note that improvements in behavioral symptoms (e.g., depression) may be due not solely to a prescribed psychotropic agent but may also be a result of the extra social contact with the treatment team that medication warrants.",

      "title": "Has the Drug of Choice for Treating Critical Illness Delirium Been Established?",
      "abstract": "Critical illness delirium (hereafter simplified to \"delirium\") is an acute confusional state seen in up to 80% of adult patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). 1 It is characterized by an altered level of consciousness, changes in cognition, perceptual disturbances, a fluctuating course, disturbances of the sleep-wake cycle, disorientation, psychomotor agitation or retardation, and hallucinations or delusions. 1As a constellation of symptoms and signs that commonly occur together, delirium should not be considered in and of itself a disease, but rather should be thought of as a syndrome, 2 specifically one of acute brain dysfunction that can typically be traced back to one or more inciting causes.The mainstay of therapy, therefore, must aim to address the underlying causes of the syndrome and not simply treat the symptoms.Just as for a patient presenting with new-onset congestive heart failure it would be inappropriate to treat the symptoms by administering furosemide and oxygen without looking for and treating the underlying cause (e.g., an acute coronary syndrome), the drug of choice for delirium cannot simply be the one that best treats the symptoms; rather, it must address the underlying cause.Therefore, the drug of choice to treat any given case of delirium will be patient-and cause-specific.It could be the antibiotic that targets the patient's infection, the free water that addresses the patient's hypernatremia, the laxatives that resolve the patient's constipation, the benzodiazepine that counters the patient's alcohol withdrawal, or the correct treatment that addresses any of the myriad other causes of delirium.The number of potential drivers of delirium is immense, and the reader is encouraged to consult other sources for further information on their assessment and treatment. 1,3,4 Of course, although it is essential to address the underlying etiology of delirium, its symptoms cannot be ignored, as they have the potential to cause significant harm to both the patient and the patient's care team.Anyone who has worked in an ICU for any period of time will have seen a patient with delirium self-extubate or pull out a Foley catheter with the balloon up!Such adverse events can result in significant morbidity and potentially even death. 5 Additionally, patients experiencing delirium can pose a danger to the care team if they become aggressive to the point of striking and injuring care providers.What may be less obvious is that these agitated patients are also at increased risk of morbidity",

      "title": "[Psychomotor epilepsy: phenomenology, localization, pathogenesis and therapy].",
      "abstract": "Next to tonic-clonic seizures psychomotor (complex focal) seizures are the most common form of all epileptic seizures, except in infancy where they are seen rarely. Differently from generalised non convulsive seizures (like petit mal absences), their first appearance has no typical age limit, however, their proportion to other forms of seizures increases in adolescence and adults especially between the third and fifth decade of life. The main symptom is the disorder of consciousness which lasts at least more than half a minute, normally several minutes in completely distinct seizures, which doesn't begin abruptly and which often ends ill defined. This twilight attack is proceeded by an aura of sensory, psychic or vegetative character. The aura is followed either by a transitory state of immobility and later by motor phenomena or at once by motor phenomena in the form of diverse automatisms of variable intensity, reaching from mild movements in the oral region over verbal expressions to highly dramatic scenes, often accompanied by vegetative symptoms. Tonic versive and tonic symmetrical or tonic asymmetrical seizure symptoms are quite often motor variants which also can lead to sudden drops. Psychomotor attacks can be reduced to \"pseudo-absences\", however, they also can develop into tonic-clonic seizures (Grand mal). Generally, the succession of seizure symptoms is constant in the same patient, the expression can differ from seizure to seizure. Psychomotor attacks can be spread over the whole day or can show a strict connection to sleep, in the course they can likely occur in clusters and can accumulate to a continuous or discontinuous form of psychomotor status epilepticus. Predominantly, but not exclusively psychomotor attacks start from the temporal lobe, whereas neocortical temporal attacks (especially of lateral posterior origin) can be distinguished from those coming from the limbic system, especially from hippocampal or mesio-basal temporal structures and from the nucleus amygdalae. About 20% of the psychomotor attacks are of frontal origin coming from the mesial frontal region or from the gyrus cinguli anterior. Also seizures of occipital or parietal origin can spread so quickly that the seizure itself is impressing as a \"temporal lobe attack\". On account of that, epilepsies with psychomotor attacks cannot be compared to temporal lobe epilepsies. The etiology of psychomotor epilepsies is closely connected to the topographic site of the temporal lobe, who is especially vulnerable for traumatic lesions, cerebral edema and hypoxemia. Also small dysgeneses, heterotopies or small abnormalities of vessels are relatively often found in surgical specimens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

      "abstract": "Kleine-Levin syndrome appears suddenly, sometimes without a triggering factor or sometimes being precipitated by an infection (38.2%), head trauma (9%) or acute consumption of alcohol (5.4%) [2-5]. The etiology remains unclear, but there may be a genetic predisposition (haplotype HLA-DR1), associated with environmental factors [6,7]. The syndrome is characterized by hypersomnia (up to 20 hours a day), cognitive symptoms (mainly derealisation, but also confusion, delusions, and/or hallucinations, memory impairments), behavioral symptoms (sexual disinhibition, irritability/aggression, compulsive eating), and mental symptoms such as depression and anxiety [4,8-13]. There are also physical signs such as autonomic dysfunction, weight gain; and at the end of the episodes, amnesia, elation, and depression. It is important to underline that these symptoms and signs are generally not combined in a single patient. The average length of an episode is 8 to 10 days, and episodes lasting several months are relatively exceptional. They usually recover after a period of about 8 years.",

      "abstract": "Los neonatos sufren innecesariamente dolor debido a lo complejo de la evaluación, la falta de entrenamiento de los profesionales, el temor a los efectos secundarios de las drogas y la clásica presunción que no lo sienten. Sin embargo, hoy día se infiere, por los indicadores del comportamiento y los fisiológicos, que el dolor está presente en ellos y debe prevenirse y tratarse para evitar el sufrimiento y los efectos nocivos debidos a los cambios fisiológicos, hormonales y biológicos que pueden “reprogramar” a largo plazo el desarrollo del sistema nervioso central. Los estudios realizados muestran que los niños no tratados debidamente para el dolor presentan dificultades en los procesos de aprendizaje, conducta, memoria, socialización, autorregulación y expresión de los sentimientos. El dolor se infiere por los parámetros de la conducta –llanto, expresión facial, respuestas motoras simples– y de la fisiología –cambios en las variables cardiorrespiratorias, sudoración palmar, liberación de catecolaminas. El tratamiento comprende, además de la asistencia humanizada, la buena técnica y los instrumentos más precisos, la terapia farmacológica con los antiinflamatorios no esteroideos, los opioides, los anestésicos locales y los adyuvantes, y la terapia no farmacológica como la postura adecuada, las caricias, el arrullo, las imágenes agradables, la música, la estimulación táctil y el movimiento. Los investigadores tratan de definir la eficacia de las terapias no farmacológicas y su funcionamiento biológico; los efectos clínicos de la terapia farmacológica y el desarrollo de métodos analgésicos no invasivos para la liberación de drogas como la utilización del Yag Láser para alcanzar rápidamente el efecto de los anestésicos locales; la iontoforesis que permite la transferencia a los tejidos de moléculas cargadas de droga bajo la influencia de la electricidad; el uso de pequeños instrumentos como el Dermoeyector, el Bioeyector y similares que suministran la droga para la anestesia local o regional mediante el uso de gases comprimidos; la utilización de matrices o microesferas polimerizadas biodegradables que al colocarlas en sitios específicos como los nervios o plexos nerviosos liberan lentamente hasta por varios días la droga analgésica y anestésica, lo que permite el alivio prolongado del dolor; la colocación de parches para la aplicación transdérmica de drogas; la administración transtraqueal de opioides como el fentanil. En conclusión, es necesario concienciar acerca de que los neonatos experimentan dolor; que se tienen bases fisiológicas para evaluarlo y tratarlo y para disminuir su exposición a estímulos nocivos y minimizar los resultados adversos. Finalmente, se recomienda que las intervenciones sean efectivas y seguras en el alivio del dolor y el estrés.",

They may be classified as dysfunctions associated with transitions into sleep, partial arousals during sleep, or following arousals from sleep (2,3). Parasomnias can be categorized either as primary or secondary. Transitional parasomnias typically occur during wake-to-sleep transitions and can persist into N1 (Stage 1) sleep. Primary parasomnias can be subdivided by the sleep from which they appear, e.g., rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, non-REM (NREM) sleep, or both. Secondary parasomnias are more commonly associated with other organ system dysfunction and manifest symptoms during the sleep period.",

Define-se o delirio, e segundo Carlos Centeno, como estado confusional agudo que deriva de uma disfuncao cerebral orgânica de etiologia multifactorial. Dependendo dos autores, varia de 28% a 85%. O delirio e um dos sintomas mais dificeis de diagnosticar e tratar, e tambem aquele que provoca maior deterioracao da qualidade de vida do doente e da sua relacao com a familia, cuidadores ou equipa de apoio. A sua presenca condiciona maiores dificuldades na avaliacao da dor, de outros sintomas ou problemas, - a obstipacao, a retencao urinaria, febre, a infeccao respiratoria ou urinaria, desidratacao, etc., - pela perturbacao que causa na comunicacao com o doente e por impedir uma participacao nas decisoes que dizem respeito a sua doenca. Apesar de ser uma situacao esperada no final de vida, pode no entanto, ser reversivel ou controlavel em cerca de 25-45% dos casos, pelo que na sua abordagem deve-se ter em conta esta caracteristica, individualizando-se caso a caso, transmitindo a familia a esperanca da reversibilidade. \nNa doenca avancada, o delirio manifesta-se por: perturbacoes cognitivas, disturbios do comportamento psicomotor, com uma instalacao aguda ou subaguda, com flutuacoes durante o dia, agravando-se para a noite, podendo adoptar uma forma hiperactiva (a mais frequente) e uma forma hipoactiva. O delirio, normalmente de etiologia multifactorial, condiciona um conjunto de medidas de intervencao que passam por: terapeutica dirigida a causa, intervencao no comportamento do doente e no ambiente, apoio a familia e o tratamento sintomatico, sobretudo fazendo uso correcto dos varios tipos de neurolepticos, assim como outro tipo de intervencoes farmacologicas.",

Asi mismo se interrelaciona con multiples problemas tanto fisicos, como psicologicos y sociales que pueden agravar o ser causa a su vez de las alteraciones del sueno. Reconocer los problemas del sueno y clasificarlos adecuadamente permite determinar la necesidad o no de estudios complementarios, seleccionar el manejo mas adecuado en forma individual, recomendar el manejo no farmacologico (terapia cognitivo conductual, manejo del ambiente), y si fuera necesario, determinar el tipo de farmaco mas adecuado en funcion de la asociacion existente con otras patologias (enfermedad pulmonar obstructiva cronica [EPOC], depresion, ansiedad, sindrome de piernas inquietas, etc.).

Case : A 17-year-old male with headache since 3 months ago, 3 days after suffered a blow to his left head from falling from a chair. At that time, the patient fainted for about 15 minutes but had no complaints after regained consciousness. Pain is felt on the left side of the head, throbbing, mild-moderate intensity, and feels heavier with a loud sound or a too-bright light. Discussion: Post-traumatic headache is clinically diagnosed. Laboratory and routine diagnostic imaging studies are unnecessary and have minimal clinical utility. Conclusion: Chronic post-traumatic headaches often occur, especially after minimally traumatic brain injury. The clinical picture is variable and may be similar to tension-type headaches and/or migraines. Pendahuluan: Nyeri kepala dalam tujuh hari setelah cedera kepala atau setelah sadar kembali dari trauma kepala disebut nyeri kepala pasca-trauma (post-traumatic headache/PTHA); disebut sakit kepala pasca-trauma kronis atau kronis (CPTHA) jika berlangsung lebih dari tiga bulan setelah cedera. Kasus: Seorang laki-laki berusia 17 tahun dengan keluhan nyeri kepala sejak 3 bulan, 3 hari setelah kepala kiri terbentur karena jatuh dari kursi. Saat itu, pasien pingsan sekitar 15 menit, tidak ada keluhan setelah sadar. Nyeri dirasakan di sisi kiri kepala, berdenyut, intensitas ringan-sedang, terasa lebih berat jika ada suara keras atau cahaya terlalu terang. Diskusi: Nyeri kepala pasca-trauma didiagnosis secara klinis. Laboratorium dan studi pencitraan diagnostik rutin tidak diperlukan dan memiliki utilitas klinis minimal. Simpulan: Nyeri kepala pasca-trauma kronis sering terjadi, terutama setelah cedera otak traumatis minimal. Gambaran klinisnya bervariasi dan dapat mirip nyeri kepala tipe tegang dan/atau migrain",

A two-compartment model consisting of and dependence was used to clarify clinical features of dependence. was defined by drug liking. Dependence was defined by a compulsion to take a drug, and drug-induced pathological symptoms (withdrawal syndrome and acute disorders) and social disturbance. Nicotine produced a mild or the least degree of drug liking and withdrawal syndrome, without any significant social disturbance, or acute disorders. Thus, differed from other forms of drug in that was not associated with dependence syndrome. This review also introduced other current topics of dependence. First, adolescence is regarded as a risk factor for the development of dependence, whereas the involvement of gender difference (female) in this respect is controversial. Secondly, many smokers feel difficulties in quitting smoking in spite of the weak potential of nicotine, which is known as the nicotine paradox. Several working hypotheses have been presented to explain this phenomenon. For example, has relatively strong conditioning effects and/or liability compared with other drugs of abuse. However, further studies should be carried out to clarify clinical characteristics of the nicotine paradox.",

Selten sind paranoide Störungen, speziell der alkoholische Eifersuchtswahn, der manchmal als Residuum einer chronischen Alkoholhalluzinose persistiert und monosymptomatisch bleibt.

Drugs, especially those related to neurotransmitters may induce complicated symptoms in the sympathetic or parasympathetic nervous system. Some of these symptoms are accompanied by peripheral neuropathy. Intoxication, especially alcoholism is often are combined with a malnutrition, such as avitaminosis. Dysautonomic symptoms change successively; at an early stage, drugs or toxins stimulate sympathetic or parasympathetic receptors, while the same receptors are inhibited at a later stage when the concentration of the substances rises in the blood. Frequent stimulations of the same receptor may produce change in the sensitivity of receptors, decreased metabolism or addiction. These changes suggest that a different approach towards the acute and chronic autonomic disorders caused by intoxications is needed.",

For example, an individual may experience a specific color for every given note (e.g., C sharp is red) or every number may be tinged with a specific hue (e.g., five is indigo and seven is green). Although synesthesia can occur in response to drugs (LSD, mescaline, peyote), sensory deprivation, or, in rare cases, brain damage, research has largely focused on individuals with the heritable trait of developmental synesthesia. Synesthesia has no known association with any disorder or condition, and research suggests a higher occurrence among artists and musicians. Furthermore, synesthetes will often lament the loss of these experiences that sometimes occurs because of depression or the use of antidepressants.",

These disorders can appear without a context of histrionic personality. The evolution of hysterical disorders during life is not well known. First of all, because the nosographic systems are not constant and, secondly, because the disorders themselves can vary when observed at different times. The aging subject is exposed to an increasing symptomatology or conversely, to an improvement due to the waekening of the narcissism. It is also possible that a continuum could be established from hysterical symptoms in the adulthood to delusions or hallucinations in the elderly. The relation with the old hysteric subject must be marked by empathy and by the conviction that improvement will only lead back to a basal symptomatology.",

      "title": "Psychiatric Sequelae of Phencyclidine Abuse",
      "abstract": "Phencyclidine use has been noted to produce a psychosis of several week's duration in a small fraction of users. Descriptions of the premorbid personalities of those who became psychotic resemble descriptions of LSD and marijuana users who experienced prolonged psychiatric difficulty. In addition, the psychosis produced can often be recognized as a \"hallucinogen\" psychosis. Certain features of the phencyclidine psychosis, namely the neurologic abnormalities, dose-related severity of symptoms, and regularity of the length of illness, are not noted with other psychedelic drugs, leading to the conclusion that PCP psychosis is a drug effect rather than a brief functional psychosis precipitated by the disintegrating PCP experience. However, the infrequent occurrence of psychosis in the (apparently) large exposed population still suggests that this is a combination of drug effect and vulnerable, pathologic personality.",

      "abstract": "Delusional disorder, the contemporary conceptualization of paranoia, is an uncommon condition characterized by the presence of one or more nonbizarre delusions and the relative absence of associated psychopathology. The delusions concern experiences that can conceivably occur in real life, such as being followed (persecutory type), having a disease (somatic type), being loved at a distance (erotomanic type), having an unfaithful sexual partner (jealous type), and possessing inflated worth, power, identity, or knowledge (grandiose type). The diagnosis requires at least 1 month's duration of the delusion; impact on functioning that is consistent with the delusion or its ramifications; generally normal appearance and behavior; and the exclusion of schizophrenia, mood disorder, substance-induced toxicity, and medical disease. Typically, patients are unaware of the psychiatric nature of the condition. They may present to internists, dermatologists, plastic surgeons, lawyers, or the police rather than to psychiatrists. Although the prevalence is low, delusional disorder is not rare. Age at onset is usually middle or late adulthood, and the course is variable. Familial transmission is suspected, and comorbidity (frequently mood disorders) may exist. Successful management is difficult and may include hospitalization, pharmacotherapy, and certain forms of psychotherapy.",

I assume that neglect, caused, for example, by right parietal damage, results neither form simple sensory loss and nor from motor impairment. It also appears not to be a unitary disorder. Failures to orient towards salient stimuli, often labelled as “neglect”, can occur because of damage to other brain regions besides the parietal lobe, and in animals other than man. But failures to orient toward stimuli can result from several different types of difficulty. most crudely to organise a response towards the contralesional side (“output” or “intentional” neglect (Valenstein & Heilman, 1981) or from problems of detecting stimuli in contralesional space (“input” neglect). Sometimes these forms of neglect apparently occur together in the same individual, raising questions about the foci and extent of their brain lesions.",

      "abstract": "The term stands for suicides committed by using more than one method. A distinction can be made between planned and unplanned complex suicides (primary/secondary combinations). In planned complex suicides 2 or more methods are applied simultaneously in order to make sure that death will occur even if one method fails. In unplanned complex suicides the mode of performance is changed after the first method chosen failed or was working too slow or proved to be too painful. In planned complex suicides typically two of the generally common methods of suicide (e.g. ingestion of medicines, hanging, use of firearms, drowning, fall from a height) are combined. But also unusual combinations have been described such as the simultaneous firing of two guns, self-immolation in combination with other suicide methods or shooting oneself while driving a car. In unplanned complex suicides self-inflicted injuries by sharp force, especially cuts of the wrists, are often found as the primary act of suicide. In some cases the suicide switches from cuts to stabs (mostly to the heart region). Other methods often used after the first phase of suicide are hanging and jump from a height. In the literature the use of up to 5 suicidal methods applied one after the other have been described.",

      "abstract": "Kernaussagen Definition und Diagnostik Die Diagnose Anpassungsstörung gehört zu den im DSM-IV und im ICD-10 eher weniger gut operationalisierten Kategorien. Ebenso ist sie gleichzeitig eine Diagnose, bei der entgegen den meisten anderen Störungen der Ätiologiebezug beibehalten wurde. So ist immer ein auslösendes Ereignis gefordert, das in einem bestimmten Zeitraum eine charakteristisch ausgestaltete Symptomatik zur Folge hat. Je nach vorherrschenden Symptomen werden Anpassungsstörungen mit depressiver Stimmung, mit Angst, mit anderen beherrschenden Gefühlszuständen, mit Störung des Sozialverhaltens und Mischformen unterschieden. Leider gibt es keine konkreten Aussagen über die Art und Stärke des auslösenden Ereignisses und über die genaue Schwere der Symptomatik, sodass die Abgrenzung der Anpassungsstörung gegenüber „normalen Reaktionen” einerseits und „höherwertigen” pathologischen Störungen – vor allem der Major Depression – andererseits sehr unscharf ist. Umso weniger verwunderlich ist es daher, dass zu dieser Störung im Vergleich zu anderen nur spärlich Studien vorhanden sind und somit auch nur wenige Aussagen, z. B. zu Prävalenz und Therapie, getroffen werden können. Therapie Verschiedene Interventionen von supportiven Gesprächen bis zur Krisenintervention / Kurzzeittherapie sowie zunehmend auch die EMDR-Technik kommen zum Einsatz. Mittlerweile wurden auch einige wenige spezifische Programme entwickelt, von denen bisher 2 spezielle Psychotherapieformen bei Anpassungsstörungen randomisiert-kontrolliert untersucht wurden. In den letzten Jahren ist die erfreuliche Entwicklung einer Hinwendung zu diesem Thema zu verzeichnen, sodass Hoffnungen auf bessere Diagnostik und Differenzialdiagnostik, vor allem aber auf spezifischere Therapien, berechtigt erscheinen.",

The authors review certain exogenous factors that seem capable of triggering attacks and/or increasing their frequency and intensity: self-administered pharmacologic agents (caffeine, alcohol, nicotine, over-the-counter cold preparations, cannabis, cocaine); habits (sleep deprivation, diet, exercise, relaxation, hyperventilation); and aspects of the environment (fluorescent lighting, life stressors). There may be a specificity to the action of some of these factors, because certain factors previously thought to trigger panic attacks (e.g., pain, hypoglycemia) have been proved not to have this effect. Although the clinical significance of many of the exogenous factors discussed still awaits empirical confirmation, attention to such factors during the initial evaluation of a patient with panic disorder may be helpful in formulating a successful treatment plan.",

SummaryRecently there has been an increase in the use of lysergide (lysergic acid diethylamide; L.S.D.) obtained illicitly.Adverse reactions are not uncommon, and six (two fatal) cases are reported.I am grateful to Professor F.

      "abstract": "Objective: To discuss a case of synthethic marijuana use and subsequent withdrawal phenomenon that clinically resulted in PRES. Background: In the last decade synthetic marijuana has emerged as a new drug of abuse. Synthetic marijuana is colloquial known as “Spice,” which is typically composed of herbs, spices and other plant matter that are sprayed with at least one synthetic cannabinoid. They have diverse chemicals that are structurally distinct from THC. Given the heterogeneity of chemical composition, the intoxication effects are diverse. The presence of a withdrawal phenomenon following chronic use and clinical sequeale are not explored in the literature to date. Design/Methods: We discuss a case presentation of acute intoxication, withdrawal phenomenology and subsequent neurological complications of synthetic marijuana usage including PRES. Results: A 26yo man was found by police and paramedics to be confused and combative after he had smoked synthetic cannabinoids earlier in the evening. He was restrained by police and brought to the emergency department where he was noted to be febrile, combative and confused with normal heart rate and blood pressure. He had an unremarkable initial head computed tomography (CT) image. His labs were significant for hypernatremia, acute kidney injury and rhabdomyolysis. His LP showed no xanthochromia or pleocytosis. On days 2–4 of the hospitalization he exhibited autonomic instability following withdrawal of his daily consumption of synthetic marijuana. A MRI was eventually obtained following 8 days in the hospital because of unresolved encephalopathy. It showed evidence of PRES, right frontal intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), small bilateral cortical and corpus collosum hemorrhages and superior cerebellar vermis subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). The CT angiogram (CTA) showed no evidence of vasospasm or vasoconstriction or aneurysm. Conclusions: Our patient exhibited withdrawal phenomenon following 2 days cessation of daily synthetic marijuana. Clinically the patient exhibited autonomic instability and poor mentation resulting radiographically in PRES, ICH and SAH. Disclosure: Dr. Stack has nothing to disclose.",

      "abstract": "A neuropsychiatric and -psychological update of the crime “profile” and “signature” is a necessary addition to the traditional sociopsychological model likely to miss limbic system dysfunctioning. Thus, occurrence of a brief (c. 20 minutes) limbic seizure has been proposed based on behaviors of 12 white male homicidal loners, who showed a dozen symptoms and signs: Limbic Psychotic Trigger Reaction. Readily overlooked can be (a) a transient psychosis (hallucinations and/or delusions), (b) autonomic hyperactivation (e.g., loss of bladder control, nausea, ejaculation), (c) motiveless, out-of-character, unplanned, and well-remembered homicidal acts, (d) committed with a flat affect (not emotionally or impulsively provoked), (e) typically involving a stranger who happened to provide an objectively harmless and only subjectively important stimulus. (f) Such an individualized stimulus triggered the memory revival of mild to moderate but repeatedly experienced hurts. Such a specific sequence of events implicates the specific mechanism of limbic seizure, “kindling,” which does not necessarily involve motor convulsions. Repetition of such limbic episodes with “criminal acts” is conceivable under specific circumstances including cases in which the triggering stimulus is associated with pleasurable delusions (e.g., of grandiose power or wealth) or constitutes a specific aspect of a basic drive motive. For example, eating or sexual activities might be planned but degenerate into a limbic episode with a specific core symptomatology.",

Se disena un estudio exploratorio y descriptivo que busca precisar sus caracteristicas. Material y metodo. Se registran los fenomenos clinicos en 61 pacientes consumidores de PBC, consultantes espontaneos de un centro tratamiento de adicciones en una comuna popular de Santiago, elegidos de modo aleatorio. Resultados. Alrededor de los dos meses de uso regular la PBC provoca conductas compulsivas de busqueda y consumo de la sustancia. Es una adiccion condicionada ya que la conducta compulsiva solo aparece como respuesta a estimulos externos (principalmente la posesion de dinero) o internos (cambios animicos o la fantasia de estar fumando). En un mismo individuo existen patones de consumo muy diferentes en un breve lapso de tiempo. Rapidamente se desarrolla sensibilizacion (hipertonia y estereotipias motoras, paranoia, ilusiones auditivas, visuales y cenestesicas, que son sintomas transitorios y vinculados al estado de intoxicacion aguda) y tolerancia (disminucion y desaparicion del efecto euforizante). La sensibilizacion y la tolerancia aparecen simultaneamente y en conjunto con la conducta compulsiva. Cada episodio de consumo por lo general termina con intensos sentimientos de culpa, ansiedad y aun ideas suicidas. Existen una frecuente perdida de normativas sociales y la constitucion de un sindrome psicopatico.

A proper diagnosis and a complete understanding of the clinical picture is essential before choosing the class, specific drug, and dosage. Anxiolytics may be used in the neuroses and as adjuncts in other disorders (ex. depression) with a strong anxiety component. Neuroleptics, in very low dosage, are indicated for psychotic anxiety. Dosage, side effects, and duration of treatment must be monitored continuously. Concomitant psychotherapy is advisable.",

Their thoughts can be scattered and require significant effort to organize, often resulting in sentences that do not come out as intended, making little sense to others. Methods : Two Patients with psychasthenia are unable to resist specific actions or thoughts, regardless of their maladaptive nature and have insufficient control over their conscious thinking and memory, sometimes wandering aimlessly and/or forgetting what they were doing. Results : The constant mental effort induces physiological fatigue, which worsens the condition. Nevertheless, psychasthenia has become a forgotten disorder. We observed two cases that are worthy of the original definition of psychasthenia. Conclusions : It can be concluded that patients with psychasthenia complain of sinking because of a reduction in psychological tension or an effort to recover the reduction in tension.",

      "abstract": "Whether the experience, symptoms, treatment or neuropathology of Parkinson's disease (PD) could potentially play a role in shaping religious beliefs and practices can be viewed from several different angles. For example, a diagnosis of a serious illness could make one reassess and question previously held attitudes and beliefs; faith in a benign God may be challenged. Spirituality, broadly defined as a quest for meaning and truth, could also play a role in the process of integrating the experience of living with Parkinson's disease, as with any disease or major life experience. Less conscious mechanisms might also be in play, more intrinsic to the disease process, such as loss of motivational drive due to dopaminergic dysfunction. The resulting apathy, which is often seen in PD, might reduce efforts to pursue personal interests, including a religious faith. Cognitive deficits, for example altered social cognition such as changes in 'theory of mind', could also potentially contribute. At a more pragmatic level, problems with decreasing mobility, and energy levels as well as a host of other symptoms and drug side-effects could potentially make all aspects of daily life problematic, therefore impeding the pursuit of religious practices or a spiritual path. In this chapter we review and discuss the existing literature and research, in the hope that it might augment understanding of this little-studied aspect of PD as well as contribute to cognitive perspectives on religious belief and experience.",

It is part of borderline personality disorder (a disorder characterized by emotional lability and ill‐considered, self‐harming acts); antisocial personality disorder (characterized by rash, ill‐thought out acts that often harm others); attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (characterized by difficulty waiting one's turn and persevering on tasks); bulimia nervosa (characterized by binge eating and subsequent purging); alcohol and drug‐use disorders; and a whole set of impulse‐control disorders, such as kleptomania, pyromania, and intermittent explosive disorder. For many of these forms of psychopathology, impulsivity is understood to contribute to their emergence.",

Symptoms associated with use are often indistinguishable from those encountered with a primary mental illness and also include aggression, confusion, and anxiety. For these patients, clinicians rely on physical presentation, symptom(s) onset, and episode duration when evaluating patients.An adult man was involuntarily admitted to inpatient status secondary to reports of bizarre behaviors that included paranoia and psychomotor agitation. Because of the severity of the symptoms, he was unable to participate in the admission assessment. On day 2, he reported having smoked a substance provided by a friend. In addition, he admitted to previous SC use on 3 occasions, with each occasion resulting in an involuntary admission to inpatient status. The course of this admission was unremarkable.A brief overview of psychiatric signs and symptoms of SC use and information to help clinicians are included. The presentation of psychotic symptoms secondary to SC may be consistent with those of psychosis or other substances of abuse. Because of the variability in the symptoms produced by SC use, clinicians are encouraged to consider SC use in the diagnostic evaluation.",

One of the still puzzling diseases with irritates doctors and patients alike is the severe drug (induced) hypersensitivity syndrome (D[i]HS), often also called drug rash (or reaction) with eosinolphilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS). It appears after 2 ― 12 weeks of treatment, affects liver (hepatitis), but also other organs like the heart (carditis), lung (pneumonitis), colon (colitis) and kidney (nephritis). Most cases have an exanthema, a rather typical swelling of the face, fever and a massive eosinophilia. Eliciting drugs are antiepileptics, certain sulfanil-amides like sulfasalazin and sulfamethoxozalole, minocyclin, allopurinol and antiretroviral agents. Depending on the eliciting drug, some organs are more frequently affected than others. The diagnosis of a drug hypersensitivity reaction underlying the severe disease is often delayed and doubted, in particular as many symptoms may continue for weeks and reappear later with other, non related drugs. Recurrences of symptoms may also be precipitated around the third week by reactivation of herpes viruses (HHV-6, CMV). Since the lethality is in the range of 10%, an early diagnosis and use of corticosteroid in cases with severe organ involvement is necessary.",

      "abstract": "Central visual syndromes are disturbances of the higher visual functions characterized by interference with the perceptions of objects whose form color outline and relationship to other objects have already been registered at the primary visual level. 4 types of central visual syndromes resulting from medications or therapies prescribed by physicians have been described. Visual hallucinations constitute the majority of these iatrogenic effects. A wide range of etiologic agents have been identified including penicillin and other anti-infectious agents antiparkinsonians major analgesics psychotropics beta-blockers cardiovascular drugs and nonsteroid anti-inflammatories among others. Bromocriptine used as an antiparkinsonian has been implicated in the etiology of visual hallucinations; the typical doses are about 10 times greater than those used in endocrinology. 3 cases of visual hallucinations have been reported after treatment with clomiphene (Clomid) an ovulation inductor. Visual hallucinations require a search for etiology and termination of use or at least reduction of dose of any implicated medication before serious and irreversible lesions occur. Another type of central visual syndrome chromotopsy is characterized by a sensation of color superimposed on observed objects. The third type transient cortical blindness is a rare condition combining bilateral blindness with a characteristic symptomatology. Its frequency is increasing with the use of new cancer medications. A complete study was published by Walsh and others on the risk of transient cortical blindness in OC users. In 1965 Walsh called attention to the possible role of OCs in the etiology of ophthalmic migraines the 4th type of central visual syndrome. The relationship is accepted by most authors although some controversy remains. Ophthalmic migraines represent only a small proportion of migraine headaches. There is a personal or family history of migraine in 75% of cases suggesting that OCs play a potentiating role. In 25 of 30 cases in 1 study the migraine crises occurred on the days of interrupted OC use or the first days of the new cycle. The strongest migraines occurred during use of OCs with the highest progestin doses. 1 author suggests that 50% of ophthalmic migraines are followed by cerebrovascular accidents. OC use should therefore immediately be terminated if ophthalmic migraines develop.",

      "abstract": "Most of the drugs used in the treatment of aggressive syndromes have originally been developed for other clinical applications. Despite significant differences in the pathogenesis of various aggressive disorders, the frequently used “antiaggression” drugs are the major tranquilizers (neuroleptics). If the aggression is associated with psychosis, chlorpromazine or haloperidol are the drugs of choice. Aggressive disorders within the acute and chronic brain syndromes are best treated with pericyazine, thioridazine, and thiothixene. In aggressive symptoms of mentally retarded patients, particularly with epileptic syndromes, a new benzazepine (SCH-12,679) was found to be very effective. Aggression associated with alcoholism or narcotic addiction showed best response to chlorpromazine and haloperidol. As a general rule, in aggressive patients with clinically known epilepsy, or with abnormal electroencephalographic findings, the major tranquilizers with potent sedative properties should be given with great caution.",

Herein this term is redefined, and an additional term, parahallucinations, is introduced. Hallucinations are defined as sensory perceptions that have the compelling sense of reality of true perceptions but that occur without external stimulation of the relevant sensory organ and are experienced as following the sensory path, that is, can be localized in three-dimensional space outside the body. Pseudohallucinations are defined as hallucinatory phenomena that do not follow the sensory path and are experienced predominantly by psychiatrically ill subjects. Parahallucinations are defined as hallucinatory phenomena that occur due to an injury or abnormality to the peripheral nervous system. Insight into the reality of these experiences-the realization that they are not real-is not felt to be important in their phenomenology.Utilization of this classification system during clinical investigations will yield greater insight into the pathophysiology, course, treatment, and prognosis of psychiatric and neurologic disorders.",

      "abstract": "The occurance of psychic changes in the midwifery period is increasingly common. Mental changes can manifest as mild difficulties, but also as serious psychiatric disorders that require treatment. Baby blues, postpartum depression, postpartum psychosis and anxiety disorders, are changes that can occur in the puerperium period. The mildest ant the most common difficulty is baby blues or postpartum grief, which last for a short time and passes without consequence for the mther and her child. In the most cases treatment is not required, support from the environment and the family is enough. Postpartum depression is a serious disorder that needs to be treated.\r\n Simptoms of postpartum depression are feelings of sadness, loss of interest, insomnia, restlessness, etc. Treatment includes pharmacoterapy for alternative procedures.\r\n Postpartum psychosis is rare but the most serious form of postpartum disorders and can have very serious consequences for the mother and her child (even fatal outcome is possible). It is treated with pharmacotherapy and alternative methods, but sometimes requires hospitalization in the department of psychiatry. Anxiety disorders are a group of disorders, that is divided into panic disorders, obsessive compulsive, post-traumatic stress disorders and other specific phobias. The cause of anxiety disorders are mainly genetic factors, unwanted pregnancies, unprepared mothers for the role of motherhood and sudden hormonal changes. A large role in the prevention of mental health problems is played by a health visitor whose task is to educate women and their families, before and after birth and contribute with advice and skills to overcome postpartum stress and inital adjustment. During the preparation of the final survey was conducted trought social network Facebook („MeĊimurske mame i trudnice“, etc.) collected was 134 responses from April to May 2019. Results have shown 67,9% of participants did not have any psychological changes after birth. Nevertheless, 32,3% have manifested certain psychological changes, with baby blues being the most common ( 17,2%) followed by postpartum depression (7,5%) and anxiety disorder (6%). The age itself does not affect the change, while understanding and family support do. Quality education and awareness of the mother is very important , but it is important that the information is verified and accurate. The role of a health visitor, throught her education and advice, can prevent and identify certain difficulties in a timely manner is crucial and of great importance.",

      "abstract": "<h3>Background</h3> Patients with atypical depression are more likely to respond to monoamine oxidase inhibitors than to tricyclic antidepressants. They are frequently offered psychotherapy in the absence of controlled tests. There are no prospective, randomized, controlled trials, to our knowledge, of psychotherapy for atypical depression or of cognitive therapy compared with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor. Since there is only 1 placebo-controlled trial of cognitive therapy, this trial fills a gap in the literature on psychotherapy for depression. <h3>Methods</h3> Outpatients with<i>DSM-III-R</i>major depressive disorder and atypical features (N=108) were treated in a 10-week, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial comparing acute-phase cognitive therapy or clinical management plus either phenelzine sulfate or placebo. Atypical features were defined as reactive mood plus at least 2 additional symptoms: hypersomnia, hyperphagia, leaden paralysis, or lifetime sensitivity to rejection. <h3>Results</h3> With the use of an intention-to-treat strategy, the response rates (21-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score, ≤9) were significantly greater after cognitive therapy (58%) and phenelzine (58%) than after pill placebo (28%). Phenelzine and cognitive therapy also reduced symptoms significantly more than placebo according to contrasts after a repeated-measures analysis of covariance and random regression with the use of the blind evaluator's final Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score. The scores between cognitive therapy and phenelzine did not differ significantly. Supplemental analyses of other symptom severity measures confirm the finding. <h3>Conclusions</h3> Cognitive therapy may offer an effective alternative to standard acute-phase treatment with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor for outpatients with major depressive disorder and atypical features.",

Chronic dystonia can occur either locally (eg, writer's cramp, blepharospasm) or systemically as part of CP or other neurological syndromes.\n\nThe management of spasticity and chronic dystonia in children requires multidisciplinary management including neurologists, paediatricians, surgeons, GPs, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and pharmacists. Pharmacotherapy forms one aspect of this management and will be the focus of this review article, but other interventions, such as physical therapy, orthopaedic surgery and procedures, such as selective dorsal rhizotomy, play a major role too. Fundamental knowledge of pharmacologic properties and toxicities of these medications is required for safe and appropriate use, and should be part of an integrated therapeutic approach in which patients, carers, therapists, physicians and surgeons have open and clear communication about the overall rehabilitation process of the patient.\n\n### Oral/enteral drugs\n\nOral, or enteral medication, can provide systemic treatment for the relief of generalised spasticity via different pharmacological mechanisms.

In cases of intrapartum asphyxia, the duration of oxygen deprivation may vary and is critical to the ensuing insult to the infant’s vital organs and, especially, to the brain. Oxygen deficiency at tissue level (hypoxia, see Box 60.1) is often accompanied by glucose and nutrient deprivation, and is further compounded by pre-existing or complicating factors in the mother, especially pyrexia, and in the infant such as sepsis or congenital anomalies, the concomitant degree of metabolic derangement (e.g. extent of hypoglycaemia or metabolic acidosis), and the time to delivery and effective resuscitation. All of these factors will potentially compound any hypoxic injury and the extent of any ensuing brain damage, described as hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE, Box 60.1). Attempts to assign an HIE ‘grade’ may help to correlate early symptoms and signs with the degree and likelihood of long-term sequelae [2], although accurate prognostication of asphyxial brain damage remains difficult.",

Les effets subjectifs et comportementaux qu’ils induisent sont très impressionnants, et malgré leur toxicité potentielle, le risque d’addiction est relativement faible par rapport à la nicotine, l’alcool ou les opiacés. Depuis la découverte des effets antidépresseurs de la kétamine, il existe un regain d’intérêt pour cette classe de molécules. En effet, la psilocybine et l’acide lysergique diéthylamide (LSD) gagnent de la popularité en tant que traitement pour la dépression et l’addiction, la 3,4-méthylènedioxyméthamphétamine (MDMA) pour l’état de stress post-traumatique, et l’ibogaïne pour l’addiction. Malgré des profils pharmacologiques distincts, ces différentes drogues partagent une cinétique d’action similaire : leurs effets thérapeutiques se font ressentir dans les heures suivant l’administration et perdurent au-delà de leur élimination par l’organisme. Ceci suggère des mécanismes plastiques et neurogéniques impliquant entre autres des facteurs trophiques.

      "title": "Secondary headache attributed to exposure to or overuse of a substance",
      "abstract": "Background Secondary headaches attributed to exposure to or the overuse of a substance are classified under chapter eight in the International Classification of Headache Disorders 3rd edition. Three distinct sub-chapters consider: 1. Headache attributed to exposure to a substance, 2. Medication overuse headache, and 3. Headache attributed to substance withdrawal. Headache attributed to exposure to a substance refers to a headache with onset immediately or within hours after the exposure, while medication overuse headache is a headache occurring on 15 or more days per month that has developed as a consequence of regular usage of acute headache medication(s) for more than three consecutive months in a patient with a pre-existing primary headache disorder. The withdrawal of caffeine, oestrogen, and opioids is most often associated with the development of headache. Discussion Despite the current headache classification, there is no certainty of a causal relationship between the use of any substance and the development of headache. Some substances are likely to provoke headache in patients that suffer from a primary headache disorder like migraine, tension-type headache or cluster headache, while others were described to cause headache even in people that generally do not get headaches. Toxic agents, such as carbon monoxide (CO) are difficult to investigate systematically, while other substances such as nitric oxide (NO) were specifically used to induce headache experimentally. If a patient with an underlying primary headache disorder develops a headache, in temporal relation to exposure to a substance, which is significantly worse than the usual headache it is considered secondary. This is even more the case if the headache phenotype is different from the usually experienced headache characteristics. Medication overuse headache is a well-described, distinct disease entity with only marginally understood pathophysiology and associated psychological factors. Managing medication overuse headache patients includes education, detoxification, prophylactic treatments and treating comorbidities, which is reflected in available guidelines. Viewing medication overuse headache as a separate entity helps clinicians and researchers better recognise, treat and study the disorder. Conclusion Identification of substances that may cause or trigger secondary headache is important in order to educate patients and health care professionals about potential effects of these substances and prevent unnecessary suffering, as well as deterioration in quality of life. Treatment in case of medication overuse and other chronic headache should be decisive and effective.",

      "title": "Gangguan psikotik akibat penggunaan ganja (cannabis): studi kasus",
      "abstract": "Ketergantungan dan penyalahgunaan zat bukan merupakan masalah baru di Indonesia. Terjadi peningkatan penyalahgunaan Narkotika, Psikotropika dan Zat Adiktif lainnya (NAPZA) di Indonesia dari tahun ke tahun, terutama penggunaan ganja karena mudah didapat. Di Indonesia terdapat antara 2-3juta orang yang pernah menghisap ganja. Penggunaan ganja dapat menyebabkan penyakit fisik (gangguan pernafasan dan kardiovaskuler) maupun mental (gangguan psikotik). Penggunaan ganja secara teratur terkait dengan munculnya gejala psikotik seperti pemikiran tidak teratur (disorganized), halusinasi, dan delusi. Umumnya para pengguna menggunakan beberapa zat, tetapi pada kasus ini hanya menggunakan satu zat saja yaitu ganja. Pada laporan ini, kami menyampaikan kasus lelaki umur 30 tahun yang mengonsumsi ganja sejak usia 17 tahun didiagnosis dengan gangguan mental dan perilaku akibat penggunaan zat multipel dan penggunaan zat psikoaktif lainnya dengan sindrom ketergantungan (F19.2) dan episode depresi sedang dengan gejala somatik (F32.11). Pasien mengalami halusinasi visual dan auditorik. Pasien mendapat terapi clozapine 25 miligram tiap 12 jam intraoral. Kasus diatas dapat disimpulkan bahwa penggunaan ganja secara kontinu memicu terjadinya psikotik.Dependence and substance abuse is not a new problem in Indonesia. There is an increase in the abuse of Narcotics, Psychotropic and other Addictive Substances (NAPZA) in Indonesia over the years, especially the use of cannabis because it is easy to obtain. Among 2-3 million people in Indonesia have smoked cannabis. The use of cannabis can cause physical illness (respiratory and cardiovascular disorders) as well as mental (psychotic disorders). Regular use of cannabis is associated with the emergence of psychotic symptoms such as disorganized thinking, hallucinations, and delusions. Generally users use some substance, but in this case only use oneÂ substance that is marijuana. In this report we present the case of 30-year-old man who consumed marijuana since the age of 17 years was diagnosed with mental and behavioral disorders due to multiple substances use and other psychoactive substance use with addiction syndrome (F19.2) and episodes of severely depressed somatic symptoms (F32.11). The patient experienced visual and auditory hallucinations. Patients were given 25 milligrams of clozapine therapy every 12 hours intraoral. From this case can be concluded that the continuous use of cannabis trigger the occurrence of psychotic.",

La cirugia funcional ha adquirido gran relevancia en el tratamiento de las complicaciones motoras de la enfermedad de Parkinson (EP) avanzada, y menos conocida es la influencia de la estimulacion cerebral profunda (ECP) en los sintomas no motores (SNM). Objetivo. Revisar la bibliografia sobre ECP y SNM en la EP. Desarrollo. Los resultados de la cirugia funcional sobre los SNM de la EP son variables en los distintos estudios. Algunos sintomas mejoran -trastornos del sueno, dolor o disconfort, trastornos obsesivo-compulsivos- y empeoran o aparecen otros -fluencia verbal, apatia, aumento de peso-. En estudios aislados se encuentra mejoria en memoria de trabajo, secuenciacion visuomotora y razonamiento, algunos trastornos digestivos, genitourinarios, de termorregulacion y olfativos, y empeoran la memoria verbal (recuerdo diferido) y visuoespacial, la velocidad psicomotora y la funcion ejecutiva, mientras que otros sintomas -hipotension ortostatica- no muestran cambios. Existen otros factores, ademas de la estimulacion, que pueden modificar los SNM, como la vulnerabilidad preoperatoria individual, la disminucion de medicacion dopaminergica tras la cirugia, la propia EP y los cambios psicosociales. En pacientes con perfiles determinados pueden existir riesgos especificos -mayor riesgo de alteracion cognitiva en pacientes de mas de 69 anos o con alteracion cognitiva precirugia; mayor riesgo de depresion, mania o suicidio en pacientes con patologia psiquiatrica previa-. Conclusiones. Es necesario valorar el riesgo-beneficio individualmente para obtener resultados optimos con este tratamiento. Se requieren estudios multicentricos que permitan esclarecer el papel de la ECP sobre los SNM.",

Evidence is presented to suggest that this association is not due to chance. The cerebral structural changes are characterized either by the presence of ‘focal’ lesions, e.g. multiple sclerosis, or by neuronal loss e.g. Huntington’s chorea. The probable mechanisms whereby these two types of structural changes effect psychiatric disturbances are discussed. It is inferred that psychiatric disturbances will occur insofar as these cerebral structural changes exert an influence on the limbic systems.",

A phobia is characterized by a strong, irrational fear of a given object or situation, often resulting in avoidance behavior. Phobic patients usually respond well to cognitive behavioral therapy. Panic disorder, which is distinguished by recurring, unexpected attacks of fear not bound to particular situations, may also be treated with cognitive behavioral therapy and/or with clomipramin, benzodiazepines or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Patients with generalized anxiety disorder, the main symptom of which is a persistent, free-floating fear over a period of at least several months, may be helped through relaxation techniques, counseling and/or medication with low doses of sedating tricyclic compounds or short-term treatment with benzodiazepines. This article will describe anamnestic findings and the results of clinical examinations of patients with anxiety disorders. Factors to be considered in differential diagnosis will be discussed.",

      "title": "THE HYPNOTIC AND HYPNOTHERAPEUTIC UNMASKING INTENSIFICATION, AND RECOGNITION OF AN EMOTION",
      "abstract": "1. When indicated, in order to facilitate rapid, radical, short-term therapy, patients may be hypnotized and then treated, sometimes successfully, both by the more usual psychotherapeutic techniques and by techniques made possible only as a result of the hypnotic interpersonal relationship. It should be stressed, however, that we do not consider hypnosis of itself either a therapeutic agent or a therapeutic technique. Patients with surgical disease are treated (i. e., operated upon) not by but under anesthesia; and likewise patients with emotional disease can be treated psychotherapeutically not by but under hypnosis. Our approach is channelizing and directive, rather than suggestive or aggressive. 2. A number of extremely specialized hypnotherapeutic techniques now exist. Among these is one that for want of a better term we have characterized as the hypnotic unmasking, intensification, or recognition of an emotion. Some patients blot out conscious awareness of emotion. Though not felt spontaneously, it can nevertheless be aroused under hypnosis. If this particular technique be utilized, the emotion of the moment may erupt into conscious awareness with such intensity as to result even in the acting out of fantasies underlying those attitudes and symptoms that have caused so much difficulty to the patient in his relationship with other human beings. Sexual fantasies, naked anxiety, or pronounced rage reactions frequently come to the fore. These patients, however, seem to know almost instinctively, in view of the frequency of psychotherapeutic sessions and the time intervals between them, exactly how much anxiety they can tolerate during any one session. The problem, therefore, seems to be not so much that of the patient's anxiety as the psychiatrist's. Nevertheless, since defenses do not constitute an automatic brake, it must be emphasized over and over again that this technique is much too dangerous for use by therapists if they be nondynamically oriented or inadequately trained. 3. The reactions elicited may be treated along dynamic lines, but without verbal consideration and investigation of transference relationships. It seems to be the intense emotional experience of the therapeutic sessions, sometimes by itself but usually only when tied in with reaction patterns, motivational bases of behavior, early attitudes, and present difficulties in interpersonal relationships, that somehow is integrated into the personality structure and thereby helps make it possible for the patient to achieve warmer, more adequate, and more satisfying relationships with those other human beings with whom he finds himself—or wishes to find himself—in intimate daily contact. 4. Calculated risks must at times be taken when treatment of this type is decided upon. These include those of suicide by the patient, of collaboration by the therapist in the fantasies of his patient, and of acting out by the patient of the fantasies of his therapist. Such pitfalls, for the most part, so it is believed, can be avoided. 5. During this discussion, we have restricted ourselves specifically to the clinical applications—diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic—of this technique. We believe it may also find use as a research tool, but in our opinion such research—and, in fact, all research with hypnosis—should be under supervision by dynamically oriented psychiatrists.",

No cause for the fever or hyperkinetic state was found, and the syndrome resolved spontaneously one week after antipsychotic drug therapy was halted. This case appears to be an example of \"acute lethal catatonia\" or the neuroleptic \"malignant\" syndrome, both of which may be due to disturbances of dopamine function within the CNS. Such cases are rare, but may be dramatic in their presentation; however, antipsychotic drugs must be withheld during the duration of the disorder.",

The doctor requires knowledge, skill, and most of all experience, but can improve the chances of a correct diagnosis and appropriate management by careful history taking, examination, and observation. This is one area in which expensive investigations are difficult to perform and frequently unhelpful. The challenges are:\n\n\n\nAlthough “confused” or confusional state are convenient descriptions to apply to a patient, they do not have a precise medical meaning and are best avoided as diagnostic terms. The term delirium is much better defined and accepted in the classification of mental disorders. It has been defined as: “an aetiologically non-specific organic cerebral syndrome, characterised by concurrent disturbances of consciousness and attention, perception, thinking, memory, psychomotor behaviour, emotion and the sleep-wake cycle”.\n\nAn apparently “confused” patient may have an alternative diagnosis such as dysphasia, dementia or psychiatric disorder.\n\nDelirium, as defined above, includes a range of different behaviours and may be subdivided into hyperactive or agitated delirium, and hypoactive or quiet delirium. The same patient can have both or neither subtype.\n\nDelirium tremens is a specific term for the confusional state caused by withdrawal of alcohol.\n\nThe prevalence and incidence of delirium depend on the population studied. Prevalence in hospital ranges from 10–20% in medical wards and could become higher as the elderly population in hospital increases. The incidence during hospitalisation ranges from 4–30%, again depending on the population studied. About 25% of people over 70 years old admitted to hospital have delirium.\n\nThe history and examination should be directed to look at …",

Worldwide, depression is a major cause of disability and premature death. Unipolar depression is commonly (about 75% of cases) non-familial, clearly associated with stressful life-events and accompanied by symptoms of anxiety and agitation; this type is sometimes termed reactive depression. Other patients (about 25%, sometimes termed endogenous depression) show a familial pattern, unrelated to external stresses, and with a somewhat different symptomatology.

Malingering is seen in apparently normal children, students, test subjects, spouses, and adults. It is not a mental disorder. Malingering may coexist with the antisocial personality disorder, with various factitious disorders, such as the Ganser Syndrome and the Munchausen Syndrome, with the hysterias and with traumatic neuroses and other mental disorders. A review of definitions and a medicolegal discussion are presented. Malingering is an act, which is distinguished from a legal or mental status. Failure to distinguish act from status accounts for the wide disparities in definitions of malingering.",

We review all Henoch–Schönlein cases published after 1969 with CNS dysfunction without severe hypertension and neuroimaging studies (n = 35), cranial or peripheral neuropathy (n = 15), both CNS and peripheral nervous system dysfunction without severe hypertension (n = 2) or nervous system dysfunction with severe hypertension (n = 2). Forty-four of the 54 patients were <20 years of age. Results. In patients with CNS dysfunction without or with severe hypertension the following presentations were observed in decreasing order of frequency: altered level of consciousness, convulsions, focal neurological deficits, visual abnormalities and verbal disability. Imaging studies disclosed the following lesions: vascular lesions almost always involving two or more vessels, intracerebral haemorrhage, posterior subcortical oedema, diffuse brain oedema and thrombosis of the superior sagittal sinus. Following lesions were noted in the subjects with cranial or peripheral neuropathy without severe hypertension: peroneal neuropathy, peripheral facial palsy, Guillain–Barré syndrome, brachial plexopathy, posterior tibial nerve neuropathy, femoral neuropathy, ulnar neuropathy and mononeuritis multiplex. Persisting signs of either CNS (n = 9) or peripheral (n = 1) nervous system dysfunction were sometimes reported. Conclusions.

Research Questions: In aggressive obsession, there is the fear of self of not being aggressive with others, while in paranoid delirium there is the fear of being persecuted by others. Aim: The concept of schizo-obsessive disorder, with onset in adolescence with OC phenomenology, with subsequently negative symptoms, productive perceptual and ideational area (auditory hallucinations and pseudo-hallucinations, next to Kandinsky Clerambault syndrome). OC phenomenology acquires connotations different from schizophrenia onset, the patient never acquiring again a disorder total insight. Results: When obsessions and compulsions were related to the content of delusional ideas and hallucinations, other typical rituals of obsessive-compulsive disorders appeared too, the patient considered sometimes irrational and excessive. The obsessive-compulsive symptoms were present a significant period of the prodrome, of active phases and residual period, being time-consuming, causing distress and interfering patient’s routine, in addition to the schizophrenia deterioration. Conclusions: Social degradation is dictated mainly by the negative dimension of schizophrenia, secondly by energy consumption in fulfilling the rituals and compulsions and finally by the mood change in depressive sense. The family emotional climate in excess potentiates the negative inversion towards family, which amplifies the sensitiveness to rejection, sensitive relationship delirium, referentiality and finally social isolation.",

Avoidance can also feature prominently. In women, OCD commonly starts in the early 20s, and is often chronic; thus it coincides with the typical childbearing years for many women and pregnancy and/or birth is a consistently cited triggering factor.1\n\nPerinatal OCD is OCD that occurs in pregnancy or postnatally. It may be a new and sudden onset in those with no previous history or an exacerbation of existing OCD. Symptoms commonly orientate around the baby and caregiving. Pregnancy onset has been more associated with fears of accidentally harming the baby by contamination (for example, ‘my hands may be contaminated’), with related compulsions including excessive washing, restriction of diet and, postnatally, avoidance of activities and contact with others such as playgroups, and minimal child handling, reducing mother–child interaction.

En el presente artículo se revisan las enfermedades psiquiátricas más frecuentes asociadas a este y la necesidad de realizar un diagnóstico adecuado y un tratamiento interdisciplinario. La entidad que más se ha podido encontrar en los pacientes con apnea del sueño es la depresión y se piensa que se debe a la fragmentación del sueño, la cual altera la producción de neurotransmisores a nivel cerebral. La ansiedad es la segunda entidad con mayor frecuencia, quizás debido a la liberación de catecolaminas durante la noche. Existen otras sintomatologías asociadas a la apnea del sueño que deben ser revisadas y que mejorarían con un tratamiento adecuado, así como también mejoraría la calidad de vida de los pacientes, pues la atención, la concentración y la memoria incrementarían o disminuirían la irritabilidad y otros síntomas.",

TremorDrug-induced tremor is typically postural or kinetic, or both.It is symmetrical and occurs acutely following drug ingestion or dose escalation.Exceptions include tremor secondary to valproate, which can appear at therapeutic or during stable treatment, or, rarely, tardive tremor.Tremor can occur secondary to many drugs, including SSRIs, lithium, tricyclic antidepressants, antiepileptics (particularly valproate), bronchodilators, amiodarone and immunosuppressives.Another underlying aetiology, such as Parkinson's disease, essential tremor or hyperthyroidism, needs to be excluded.Management consists of altering the dose of, or if possible stopping, the offending drug, or switching to an alternative drug.Should the offending drug need to be continued, discuss the risks of the adverse effects versus the benefits of continuing to ensure the patient is informed.If the drug is continued, drugs typically used for essential tremor (for example, propranolol) can occasionally be beneficial.

Agitation can arise from any number of sources, including pain, physiological compromise, or anxiety [2]. Sikich and Lerman [3] defined emergence delirium as “a disturbance in a child’s awareness of and attention to his/her environment with disorientation and perceptual alterations, including hypersensitivity to stimuli and hyperactive motor behavior in the immediate postanesthesia period.” Emergence agitation and emergence delirium have been used interchangeably in most of the literature. Despite numerous attempts to explain the causes of emergence agitation/delirium, there is no definitive explanation. Possible causes include pain, preoperative anxiety, type of surgical procedures, personal characteristics of the patient, and type of anesthetics, although no sole factor can explain the etiology of emergence agitation/delirium [4], in large part due to the greatest obstacle to understanding emergence agitation/delirium is the lack of a standardized tool to assess it. The reported prevalence of emergence agitation/delirium varies greatly in the literature, ranging from 10% to 80% [5,6], depending on the definition and criteria of emergence agitation/delirium.

Aunque no existen mecanismos fisiopatologicos claros, existe la posibilidad de que se trate de una alteracion secundaria al contexto estresante del debut psicotico. Alternativamente, los pacientes con un trastorno psicotico podrian sufrir una regulacion anomala de la secrecion de prolactina con un exceso de factores estimuladores o un defecto de los factores inhibitorios. En la presente revision narrativa se comentan diferentes posibles mecanismos fisiopatologicos implicados incluyendo el papel del estres y la regulacion de la secrecion de prolactina en la via tuberoinfundibular, que puede evaluarse clinicamente con pruebas funcionales endocrinologicas. Este conocimiento ofrece una oportunidad de investigar las causas de estas alteraciones y dilucidar los mecanismos implicados en la hiperprolactinemia en fases tempranas de psicosis. EnglishIn the last decade, previous studies have shown an increase in prolactin levels in drug-free patients with a first psychotic episode compared to healthy controls. Although pathophysiological mechanisms are not well understood, there is the possibility that this finding is secondary to the stressful context of the psychotic onset. Alternatively, patients with a psychotic disorder may suffer from an abnormal regulation of prolactin secretion with an excess of stimulating factors or a defect in inhibitory factors. In the present narrative review different possible physiopathological mechanisms are discussed, including the role of stress and the regulation of prolactin secretion in the tuberoinfundibular pathway, which can be evaluated clinically with endocrinological functional tests. This knowledge offers an opportunity to investigate the causes of these alterations and elucidate the mechanisms involved in the hyperprolactinemia at early phases of psychosis.",

If agitation persists and patients have contraindications for these substances, then anesthetics, such as propofol, can also be used as well, to serve as a sedative. Our attention was drawn to a particular case in which dexmedetomidine was used as a sedative.<br/> AIM: To study the literature on the use of α2-agonists, such as dexmedetomidine, in the treatment of extreme agitation.<br/> METHOD: We reviewed the relevant scientific literature.<br/> RESULTS: α2-agonists, such as dexmedetomidine, are new anesthetic agents that have analgetic and sympatholytic effects without suppressing respiration. These agents are used frequently in intensive care because their sedative effect are short-lived and do not cause amnesia, sleep deprivation or cognitive disturbance. Excited delirium syndrome (eds) is a type of extreme agitation for which dexmedetomidine can be used.<br/> CONCLUSION: There may well be a place for dexmedetomidine in the treatment of extreme agitation when standard treatments have failed. Further research is needed in order to ascertain whether dexmedetomidine should play a role in such treatment.",

In clinical practice benzodiazepine misuse is generally encountered in one of the three following situations: as part of a complex presentation of polysubstance dependence, in patients who have been prescribed therapeutic doses of benzodiazepines and have difficulty stopping use, and rarely, dependence on benzodiazepines as the primary drug of abuse. Determining the extent of the problem is hindered by various definitions of abuse and dependence. In this chapter, we follow the use of previous publications: ‘‘The terms abuse and misuse refer to the use of a drug in a manner that is not consistent with generally accepted medical practice or social and legal custom, e.g., use without a valid prescription or deliberately to produce intoxication, pleasure or a high’’ (Ciraulo and Sarid-Segal, 2005, p. 1300). Misuse is used to describe patients who use higher than prescribed doses, or obtain medications from a friend or relative for therapeutic purposes.",

Despite being conscious, the individual may feel separated from their body, as if it were under the control of an external force. This case report represents a 22-year-old patient with no prior criminal history who experienced episodes of decreased consciousness, altered identity, and involuntary movements. These episodes were perceived as being controlled by an external force and culminated in a tragic event leading the patient to kill her children. After ruling out other potential causes like psychotic disorders, organic factors, and substance abuse, a diagnosis of dissociative trance disorder was considered. Treatment with cognitive behavioral therapy, antidepressants, antipsychotics, and benzodiazepines resulted in improvement of the patient's symptoms.",

      "title": "Hypnosis as an Adjunct to Anesthesia in Children",
      "abstract": "Most children anticipate the prospect of submitting to surgery and anesthesia with fear and apprehension. Youngsters who have to be given an anesthetic are afraid that something disastrous may happen to them while they are asleep. The child fears not only what he can understand but also what is less understandable, such as will he ever wake up or is he going to be killed? There are many connections in the child's mind between anesthesia, sleep, and death.1 When a child is brought to the operating room heavily premedicated or asleep, without having his fears allayed or his anxieties resolved, he will usually experience a nightmare of restlessness on recovery. During such a confused and stressful state, a child is more subject to psychic trauma than one who will recover quickly and quietly to a state of full consciousness and awareness.2 Sleep disturbances, temper tantrums, hallucinatory phenomena, and dependency reactions have been reported after surgical procedures where anesthesia was administered.3 In order to cope with this situa¬ tion, anesthesiologists in recent years have become more aware and better oriented to the psychological aspects of anesthesia for children.4·5 It is but a short step in inducing anesthe¬ sia in children with the use of stories, music, and flavoring agents to the superior effec¬ tiveness of an hypnotic induction. With children, relaxation by means of hypnosis is worth while. The comparative ease of inducing hypnosis in many children is a surprising finding. More than half of them can reach a sufficient hypnotic depth to permit minor surgical procedures, such as venipuncture, spinal tap, and reduction of simple fractures, to be performed. Hypnosis is a valuable method of inducing anesthesia or achieving basal anesthesia in children.6·7 Hypnotic inductions permit the use of posthypnotic suggestions that render recovery from anesthesia less distressing and more pleasant. Results in such cases are gratifying, because on recovery these children are quieter, more comfortable, and more cooperative than those who undergo anesthesia induced by chemical agents alone. Although hypnosis may be performed suc¬ cessfully in younger children on occasion, youngsters between the ages of 7 and 14 years are the most susceptible. These chil¬ dren usually make good subjects because of their heightened powers of imagination and their ability to play a role or create a fantasy. I try to use the child's own experiences—things with which he is famil¬ iar, so that better imagery can be produced. If children are admitted the day prior to surgery, a visit may be made in the after¬ noon or evening in order to take advantage of the opportunity of becoming acquainted with the child and to ascertain his area of interests. If it is possible to have a pre¬ liminary rehearsal of the hypnotic induction, it will serve the anesthesiologist well. How¬ ever, no attempt should be made to force the situation.

      "title": "Central anticholinergic syndrome (CAS) in anesthesia and intensive care.",
      "abstract": "Many of the drugs used in anesthesia and intensive care may cause blockade of the central cholinergic neurotransmission. Acetylcholine is of significance in modulation of the interaction among most other central transmitters. The clinical picture of the central cholinergic blockade, known as the central anticholinergic syndrome (CAS), is identical with the central symptoms of atropine intoxication. This behaviour consists of agitation including seizures, restlessness, hallucinations, disorientation or signs of depression such as stupor, coma and respiratory depression. Such disturbances may be induced by opiates, benzodiazepines, phenothiazines, butyrophenones, ketamine, etomidate, propofol, nitrous oxide, and halogenated inhalation anesthetics as well as by H2-blocking agents such as cimetidine. There is an individual predisposition for CAS--but unpredictable from laboratory findings or other signs. Reports of postanesthetic occurrence of the CAS requiring treatment are not unanimous, varying between 1 and 40%. Differential diagnosis of the CAS includes disorders of glucose and electrolyte metabolism, severe hormonal imbalance, respiratory disorders (hypoxia, hypercarbia), hypothermia, hyperthermia and neuropsychiatric diseases (cerebral hypoxia, stroke, catatony, acute psychosis). The CAS may considerably impair the postanesthetic period especially when agitation is prevalent, which may endanger the patient or the surgical results. The diagnosis is confirmed ex iuvantibus by the sudden increase in the acetylcholine level in the brain. This is achieved with physostigmine, a cholinesterase inhibitor able to easily cross the blood-brain barrier. Its peripheral muscarinic effects are minimal. Postanesthetic CAS can be prevented by administration of physostigmine during the anesthesia procedure. During intensive care (IC), agitated forms of CAS may occur in patients undergoing mechanical ventilation, particularly during prolonged high-dose sedation. Artificial ventilation of such patients becomes very difficult and muscle relaxation may be necessary. In these cases of IC-CAS, physostigmine is of value and has proven beneficial during weaning from mechanical ventilation. Dealing with the CAS for more than a decade has improved knowledge of the central cholinergic transmission. For example, it can be said that CAS occurs alongside general anesthesia, being no more than a frequent side-effect. Furthermore, acetylcholine is involved in nociception through the endorphinergic and the serotoninergic systems. There is a close relation between the central cholinergic transmission and actions of nitrous oxide. Moreover, cholinergic transmission is involved in withdrawal from (among others) alcohol, opiates, hallucinogens and nitrous oxide. In some intoxications with psychoactive agents, physostigmine is useful for reversal of the central nervous symptoms of the acute intoxication itself. In addition it can be used for prevention of some withdrawal states. In",

      "title": "1001 A Case of Unusual Nocturnal Movements Consistent with Paroxysmal Hypnogenic Dyskinesia",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Paroxysmal hypnogenic dyskinesia (PHD) is a rare subset of paroxysmal dyskinesias characterized by recurring involuntary dystonic or choreoathetoid movements that occur during sleep or immediately after an arousal from sleep. These episodes often occur without loss of consciousness or trigger and lack association with epileptiform electroencephalography (EEG) activity. Report of case(s) A 61-year-old male with obstructive sleep apnea compliant with PAP was referred for abnormal nighttime movements for the past 9 years. The episodes were characterized by stereotyped involuntary dystonic posturing involving his upper extremities or his entire body lasting up to 15 seconds. The onset of the events occurred invariable during nighttime sleep and resulted in awakenings from sleep. He denied dream enactment as well as other symptoms suggestive of sleep-related movement disorders or parasomnias. Sleep deprived EEG demonstrated left temporal slowing during wakefulness and drowsiness and captured a typical event that occurred during NREM stage II sleep and had no ictal correlate. An MRI of the brain was unremarkable. During overnight polysomnogram, his current PAP settings were found to be effective, and three episodes of body stiffening consistent with his typical events were captured. These episodes were found to occur after awakening from REM sleep and lasted less than 10 seconds each. There was no EEG correlate, and REM atonia was preserved throughout. The patient was started on oxcarbazepine for the nocturnal movements, which reduced the frequency of events from 12 to 4 events per night. Oxcarbazepine was tapered and discontinued due to side effects and incomplete control of the events. Genetic testing for epilepsy syndromes is pending. Conclusion PHD is a rare syndrome of involuntary movements which begin during sleep or cause awakenings from sleep and can be misdiagnosed as a sleep disorder. It is crucial for the sleep physician to be aware of possible neurological causes of sleep-related movement disorders. Furthermore, our patient’s partial response to oxcarbazepine may further support that PHD may have an epileptic origin although not well characterized.

      "abstract": "Modified state of consciousness (MSC) is defined as a mental state that can be subjectively recognized by an individual or by an objective observer of the individual, as representing a difference in the psychological functioning of the “normal” state, alert and awake of the individual. Drugs are products with definitions and conceptual boundaries, historically defined. The use of psychoactive drugs is related to the increased plasticity of human subjectivity which is reflected in various technical means to change the perception, cognition, affect and mood. The authors propose to conduct a literature review on the types of MSC, the way to achieve them and their implications in drug consumption pattern. A MSC consists of dimensions such as self-oceanic limitlessness, agonizing self-dissolution and visionary restructuring. Normal MSC includes dreams, hypnagogic state and sleep. Others may be induced by hypnosis, meditation or psychoactive substances. Those achieved by drugs allow the subject to access feelings and sensations which go beyond the everyday reality or, on the other hand, leakage of reality. Anthropological studies show that in almost all civilizations, man sought ways to induce MSC. What characterizes the problematic or abusive use of certain substances is not necessarily the amount and frequency of drug use, but the disharmony in the socio-cultural, family and psychosocial contexts of the individual.

An acute withdrawal syndrome normally regresses in less than one week, but a subacute withdrawal syndrome, which presents as signs of residual hyperexcitability of the central nervous system, must be recognized, as it may persist for several months.

The most common cause of NAS are opioids such as heroin, codeine and morphine and is commonly termed as opioid withdrawal syndrome but also other legally or illegally sold substances over the counter can contribute to this syndrome. Infants also develop some kind of addition in the womb when exposed to some antidepressants such as barbiturates and benzodiazepine. There are two kinds of NAS that exist, prenatal NAS which is as a result of the termination of medication being used with a pregnant mother and postnatal NAS which occurs as a result of the termination of drugs directly to the infant. The most frequently occurring syndrome consists of tremor, insomnia, perspiration, Common syndrome according to the frequency includes tremor, high-pitched sneezing sound, increased muscle tone, regurgitation and emesis, loose stools, s, excoriation, mottling, nasal congestion low-grade fever, and tachypnea. Opioid withdrawal symptoms can be a reflection of other symptoms of other conditions in a new-born, such as infections, hypoglycaemia, hypocalcaemia, hypothyroidism, and brain complications (eg., cerebral palsy). The need and time frame of treatment is reduced by breastfeeding. All NAS babies need to be followed up regularly. Not all infants will require treatment with pharmacotherapy, but all should receive non-pharmacologic interventions.

Instead, depression is associated with a dysregulation of neurochemical firing patterns.

Familial : This could be an important cause as individuals from families with a history of any kind of addiction are more likely to develop addiction.. The family scenario is again a driving force e.g. history of alcoholism in the parents may become an important cause. Surroundings: Again as the Children are brought up by alcoholic or drug addicted parents gets family environment becomes a causative factor. Individuals from countries where use of a certain substance is not imposed as an illegal sanction have higher role to play as the causative factor. Exploitation: Individuals who experienced sexual, psychological, emotional or physical exploitation are more likely to become addicts. The addiction becomes a coping mechanism in them.High Emotions: Emotional disorders such as anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder often increase the risk of substance abuse. In them the insecurity feeling flares up the urge to use to drugs. Action of drug: Certain substances are more addictive than others, and risk of full-blown addiction is higher for drugs such as opioids, alcohol & tranquilizer because of their ability to create dependence after just a quick time.Low Frustration Tolerance: One common factor found amongst addicts of all types is a low frustration tolerance. Addicts are highly susceptible to the negative effects of stress, having a low threshold of facing the disturbances. They become easily upset over everyday stress factors, creating a need for escape. They find this escape in their addiction.Absentism at school: Frequently missing classes or missing school, a sudden disinterest in school or school activities, and a drop in grades may be indicators of drug use.Weak All of a Sudden : Lack of energy and motivation may indicate that child is using certain drugs.Listless appearance: Adolescents are generally concerned about how they look. A lack of interest in clothing, grooming or looks may be a warning sign of drug use.c",

In generalized anxiety disorder, neurotic fear appears in the form of fears, expectations, tension, with nothing specifically uncomprehendingly crying anticipation, worry, poor concentration, psychic and physical fatigue, irritability, restlessness, insomnia, sense of near accident etc. Traumatic events in the life of the individual are often referred to as potential relevant factors in the occurrence of psychological disorders. Exposure to long-lasting traumatic experiences in childhood leads to the prolongation and fixation of the emotional state of fear and sadness and the emphasized use of certain defense mechanisms that contribute to the structuring of specific clinical images of anxiety states.",

      "abstract": "Attempting to treat patients who are actively using addictive drugs is unlikely to be helpful and is potentially harmful. Actively using patients should be referred for detoxification before treatment for insomnia is implemented. All drugs of abuse cause insomnia. Although insomnia is most severe during withdrawal, it may be a long-lasting complication of addiction. Cocaine has been shown to provoke \"occult\" insomnia: degraded sleep accompanied by deteriorated cognitive functioning without the sensation of lack of sleep. This is thought to be caused by a decreased drive for sleep. Insomnia during methadone maintenance is the rule. Because of methadone-provoked central sleep apnea and because of the common lethality of benzodiazepines added to methadone, benzodiazepines are contraindicated during methadone maintenance. Physicians should be sure to include non-medication approaches for insomnia such as sleep hygiene, and if available, acupuncture. If medications are indicated for insomnia, trazodone, low-dose mirtazapine, quetiapine, clonidine, and valproic acid are good choices. Drug dreams are probably provoked by the same mechanism as drug craving: up-regulation of the ventral tegmental dopaminergic seeking system. Attention to drug-seeking during dreams may facilitate recovery.",

A similar procedure should occur in the psychiatric evaluation of, say, a patient with depression, first looking for secondary causes, such as Cushing's syndrome, before considering a diagnosis of one of the idiopathic causes, shch as major depressive disorder.

A number of developments are now reversing this trend. One of these developments is the reworking of the concept of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) from that of a residual category (anxiety after all other anxiety disorders are removed) to a generalized anxiety syndrome that includes symptoms of mild depression that are less severe than the symptoms of anxiety. GAD is thereby expanded to a broader concept, namely mixed anxiety/depression (MAD). A second major development, however, posits a different definition of MAD: a stable core of subsyndromal symptoms that do not reach the threshold for the diagnosis of GAD or depression, but which, under stress, will decompensate to an overt anxiety disorder or depression.",

      "abstract": "Behavioral and psychological symptoms represent common complications in patients with different types of dementia. Predominantly, they comprise psychosis, agitation and mood disorders, disinhibited behavior, impairment of the sleep and wakefulness rhythm, wandering, perseveration, pathological collecting, or shouting. Their appearance is related to more rapid progression of the disease, earlier institutionalization, use of physical restraints, and higher risk of mortality. Consequently, appearance of behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia leads to higher costs of care provided and greater distress for caregivers. Clinical guidelines recommend nonpharmacological approaches as the first choice in the treatment of behavioral and psychological symptoms. Pharmacological therapy should be initiated only if the symptoms were not the result of somatic causes, did not respond to nonpharmacological interventions, or were not caused by the prior medication. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, memantine, antipsychotic drugs, antidepressants, mood stabilizers, and benzodiazepines are used. This review summarizes the current findings about the efficacy and safety of the treatment of the neuropsychiatric symptoms in dementias with psychopharmaceuticals. Recommendations for treatment with antipsychotics for this indication are described in detail as this drug group is prescribed most often and, at the same time, is related to the highest risk of adverse effects and increased mortality.

Case Summary: A 29-year-old white man and a 29-year-old white woman developed apathy, hypoactivity, blunted affect, depressed mood, and other depressive symptoms while taking olanzapine. Both showed a distinctly abnormal appearance. Clinicians attributed these symptoms to psychiatric illness, but the symptoms disappeared rapidly after drug discontinuation or dose decrease. Discussion: The only previous report of depression from olanzapine involved a medication interaction with fluoxetine. Another report described olanzapine-induced orbital-frontal syndrome, with childlike oversimplicity. If such symptoms are observed, the discontinuation of olanzapine is recommended. Conclusions: These observations suggest additional cautions when olanzapine is used outside of schizophrenia.",

A technique of nitrous oxide administration beyond the state of intoxication and avoiding the Stage of deep hypoxemia has been described. 3. Physiological changes with this form of anæsthesia are slight and the method may be considered safe. 4. After the anæsthesia, a period of facilitation of mental processes is observed, which is followed by a period of relaxation and sedation. 5. During the phase of facilitation, the patient has a feeling of increased well-being and shows greater spontaneity, less resistance, and enhanced insight, often expressing previously repressed ideational content and affects. 6. The period of sedation lasts for several hours and is not associated with drowsiness or confusion. Sleep is usually improved the following night and other sedation is often unnecessary. 7. In states of acute manic excitement, repeated daily administration of nitrous oxide has controlled and terminated the attack in some cases. 8. Nitrous oxide hypoxia produces some of the features of the \"shock treatments\" as well as of narcoanalysis, but it is safe, convenient, and simple in administration and may be used in ambulatory patients without interruption of their ordinary activities. 9. The theories on the pharmacological action of nitrous oxide and the reason for its choice are discussed.",

Psychosis is a gross impairment of reality testing, often manifest by hallucinations or delusions. Psychotic symptoms can be an inherent aspect of an illness or a secondary complicating factor. Earlier-onset/primary psychotic disorders, schizophrenia and related disorders, bipolar disorder with psychotic features, often extend into old age. Severe functional disability affects the surrounding environment and worsens caregiver stress, leading to reduced productivity beyond that of the patient. The aging brain shows a disproportion in the synthesis, discharge, and inactivation of noradrenergic, serotonergic, and dopaminergic neurons, loss of resilience, and loss of cognitive reserve, all increasing the risk for psychosis developing as a complication of an underlying pathology.",

Ces stimulus étaient l'apomorphine, l'émétine, la scoline et le choc électrique. Rien n'indique à l'évidence que ces méthodes sont plus efficaces que les autres, non excitantes, pour traiter les alcooliques. L'échec de ces méthodes est parfois attribuable à des modes de conditionnement défectueux. Ainsi, (1) la difficulté qu'on éprouve à régler l'intervalle entre la présentation du stimulus conditionné (SC) (alcool) et la survenance du réflexe non conditionné (RNC) (nausée et vomissements). L'intervalle critique (de 0 à 5 secondes) entre le SC et le RNC est d'une extrême importance dans le conditionnement classique; (2) L'effet hypnotique souvent produit par les drogues productrices de nausées, qui peut rendre difficile le processus du conditionnement. Cependant, même lorsqu'un réflexe de répugnance à l'alcool est bien conditionné, il peut ne pas suffire à produire des modifications du comportement chez le buveur. Rien non plus ne vient prouver l'efficacité thérapeutique particulière du LSD.L'auteur met en lumière la difficulté d'évaluation de la plupart des études passées en revue et il expose les conditions minimales qui président à des études bien faites.

In many neurological disease states associated with subcortical pathology a similar pattern of dementia exists. The neurobehavioural changes of progressive supranuclear palsy thus typify a clinical pattern which may be referred to as subcortical dementia. The subcortical dementias have a striking clinical resemblance to the dementia which occurs after bifrontal lobe disease. However, the subcortical dementias can be clearly distinguished clinically from cortical dementias, other than frontal dementias. We propose as a tentative hypothesis that there may be common pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the subcortical dementias—in particular, disturbances of timing and activation. There are immediate practical implications of this hypothesis: drugs which have an effect on subcortical timing and activating mechanisms may be useful in the treatment of subcortical dementias.",

      "abstract": "The term ‘‘adrenergic’’ originates from ‘‘adrenaline’’ and describes hormones or drugs whose effects are similar to those of epinephrine. Adrenergic stress is mediated by stimulation of adrenergic receptors and activation of post-receptor pathways. Critical illness is a potent stimulus of the sympathetic nervous system. It is undisputable that the adrenergic-driven ‘‘fight-flight response’’ is a physiologically meaningful reaction allowing humans to survive during evolution. However, in critical illness an overshooting stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system may well exceed in time and scope its beneficial effects. Comparable to the overwhelming immune response during sepsis, adrenergic stress in critical illness may get out of control and cause adverse effects. Several organ systems may be affected. The heart seems to be most susceptible to sympathetic overstimulation. Detrimental effects include impaired diastolic function, tachycardia and tachyarrhythmia, myocardial ischemia, stunning, apoptosis and necrosis. Adverse catecholamine effects have been observed in other organs such as the lungs (pulmonary edema, elevated pulmonary arterial pressures), the coagulation (hypercoagulability, thrombus formation), gastrointestinal (hypoperfusion, inhibition of peristalsis), endocrinologic (decreased prolactin, thyroid and growth hormone secretion) and immune systems (immunomodulation, stimulation of bacterial growth), and metabolism (increase in cell energy expenditure, hyperglycemia, catabolism, lipolysis, hyperlactatemia, electrolyte changes), bone marrow (anemia), and skeletal muscles (apoptosis). Potential therapeutic options to reduce excessive adrenergic stress comprise temperature and heart rate control, adequate use of sedative/analgesic drugs, and aiming for reasonable cardiovascular targets, adequate fluid therapy, use of levosimendan, hydrocortisone or supplementary arginine vasopressin.",

Karakteriziraju ga neuromuskularni simptomi, promjene u mentalnom statusu i nestabilnost autonomnog živcanog sustava, a da ti simptomi nisu uvjetovani psihijatrijskim poremecajem. Otprilike 85% klinicara ne uvažava serotoninski sindrom kao mogucu dijagnozu odnosno ne ukljucuju je u diferencijalno dijagnosticko razmatranje. Prikazana je bolesnica u koje je u prvoj i cetvrtoj hospitalizaciji diferencijalno dijagnostici dolazio u obzir serotoninski sindrom. Prva hospitalizacija uslijedila je 2004. nakon pokusaja suicida antidepresivima. Prije cetvrte hospitalizacije je uzimala amitriptilin u nepoznatim i povecanim dozama, a na hospitalizaciju dolazi u pratnji djelatnika MUP-a zbog agresivnog ponasanja nakon intervencije susjeda. Pri dolasku je bila vremenski dezorijentirana, anksiozna, u tenziji, psihomotorno uzbuđena, ustrasena, inkoherentnog duktusa, uz tremor i hiperrefleksiju. Klinicka slika imala je znacajke i serotoninskog sindroma i medikamentnog delirija. Tijekom triju hospitalizacija lijecena je kao povratni depresivni poremecaj, a na cetvrtoj hospitalizaciji posumnjalo se na bipolarni afektivni poremecaj. Prikazom ove bolesnice željeli smo pokazati kako se simptomi serotoninskog sindroma preklapaju sa znakovima i simptomima psihijatrijskih poremecaja te kako je tesko odrediti dijagnozu bez dobre anamneze i heteroanamneze, te pracenja bolesnice.",

This hallucinogenic effect is caused by Psilocybin, ahallucinogenic substance often found within Psilocybe mushroom. This substanceaffects mental state of the consumer and has similar effect to those of LSD andMescaline. Aside from its effect to cause mental disturbance, consumption of thismushroom may cause acute renal injury which leads to a fatal and life-threateningsituation.Case presentation: A case of Psilocybe intoxication had been reported in a22 years old male with a confirmed history of consuming Psilocybe mushroom. Patientfirst came with a symptom of disorientation and restlessness. Patient also often shookhis head off, laughed out, screamed, and continuously making bizarre movements.Psychiatric examination confirmed a sign of auditory hallucination, unstable mood,and stereotypical behavior experienced by the patient.

Chronotype, which represents individual preferences for activity and performance, is associated with human health issues, particularly psychiatric disorders. This narrative review, which focuses on the relationship between chronotype and mental disorders, provides an insight into the potential mechanism. Recent evidence indicates that (1) the evening chronotype is a risk factor for depressive disorders and substance use disorders, whereas the morning chronotype is a protective factor. (2) Evening chronotype individuals with bipolar disorder tend to have more severe symptoms and comorbidities. (3) The evening chronotype is only related to anxiety symptoms. (4) The relationship between chronotype and schizophrenia remains unclear, despite increasing evidence on their link. (5) The evening chronotype is significantly associated with eating disorders, with the majority of studies have focused on binge eating disorders. Furthermore, the underlying mechanisms or influence factors are described in detail, including clock genes, brain characteristics, neuroendocrinology, the light/dark cycle, social factors, psychological factors, and sleep disorders. These findings provide the latest evidence on chronotypes and psychiatric disorders and serve as a valuable reference for researchers.",

What has not been emphasized in the literature is how stereotyped these hallucinations are. Entirely visual, as is characteristic of the organic hallucination, they occur in the parkinsonian patient not only as a consequence of levodopa administration, but also as a manifestation of anticholinergic medications, such as trihexyphenidyl hydrochloride (Artane), benztropine (Cogentin) mesylate, and procyclidine hydrochloride (Kemadrin). The visual hallucinations that occur with the use of anticholinergic medication seem identical to those evoked by levodopa, and the same series of hallucinations in a single patient may be produced by either. It has been my experience that if the patient is receiving both levodopa and an anticholinergic drug, discontinuation of anticholinergic therapy will generally result in alleviation of the hallucinations. But most peculiarly of all, the characteristic",

Esta revisión describe las características clínicas de la EP con énfasis en aquellas que diferencian la enfermedad de otros trastornos parkinsonianos. Debido a que no existe una prueba definitiva para el diagnóstico de la EP, la enfermedad debe diagnosticarse con base en criterios clínicos. El temblor en reposo, la bradicinesia, la rigidez y la pérdida de los reflejos posturales se consideran generalmente los signos cardinales de la EP. La presencia y la presentación específica de estas características se utilizan para diferenciar la EP de los trastornos parkinsonianos relacionados. Otras características clínicas incluyen síntomas motores secundarios (por ejemplo: Hipomimia, disartria, disfagia, sialorrea, micrografía, marcha arrastrando los pies, festinación, congelación, distonía, reflejos glabelares), síntomas no motores (por ejemplo: Disfunción autonómica, anomalías cognitivas / neuroconductuales, trastornos del sueño y anomalías sensoriales como anosmia, parestesias y dolor). La ausencia de temblor en reposo, la aparición temprana de dificultad para caminar, la inestabilidad postural, la demencia, las alucinaciones y la presencia de disautonomía, oftalmoparesia, ataxia y otras características atípicas, junto con una respuesta deficiente o nula a la levodopa, sugieren diagnósticos distintos de la EP. Un conocimiento profundo del amplio espectro de manifestaciones clínicas de la EP es fundamental para el diagnóstico adecuado de la enfermedad.

      "abstract": "About one third of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) experience hallucinations, mostly of a complex visual type, less often auditory or tactile. Minor hallucinatory phenomena, including sense of presence, passage hallucinations and visual illusions are frequent. Hallucinations primarily occur in a context of clear sensorium in patients with longstanding PD. They are more frequent in the evening or during the night. Insight in the hallucinatory nature of the phenomenon may be retained, partial, fluctuating, or abolished. An altered insight is common when cognitive impairment is present, and may be associated with delusions and (or) delusional misidentifications. Pharmacological factors such as dopaminergic treatment clearly trigger or increase the occurence of hallucinations in PD. However, in the recent years, emphasis has been made on disease-related factors including cognitive impairment, diurnal somnolence, visual disorders (either contrast and color discrimination impairment due to PD, or coincident ocular disorders), long duration of PD, late onset, severe axial impairment and autonomic dysfunction. The pathophysiology of hallucinations of PD is poorly understood but is likely to be multifactorial. The first steps of the treatment consist in giving information and reassurance to the patient and his/her caregiver, re-evaluating the antiparkinsonian treatment and associated medications, and evaluating the patient for mood disorder, visual impairment, and cognitive impairment. Cholinesterase inhibitors, when prescribed for associated cognitive impairment, may be beneficial on hallucinations. In the more severe forms, clozapine has been proved to be safe and effective.",

Some neurological conditions characterized by movement disorders that start or persist during sleep hinder sleep onset and/or sleep continuity, causing a poor sleep complaint. CNS lesions and/or dysfunction in three specific neurological conditions (fatal familial insomnia, Morvan's chorea, and delirium tremens) impair the basic mechanisms of sleep generation inducing a syndrome in which the inability to sleep is consistently associated with motor and sympathergic overactivation.

Symptoms typically begin around age 40, with wide variation (Bell, 1934; Heathfield and McKenzie, 1971; Folstein et al., 1987). As in many other neurodegenerative disorders, early onset of HD is associated with more severe disease and a more rapid course. Onset of the disease in childhood is marked by akinesia, rigidity, severe intellectual impairment, and shorter survival (Merritt et al., 1969; Conneally, 1984; Bryois, 1989). Late-onset disease usually presents with severe chorea but milder cognitive impairment, and has a more gradual decline (Myers et al., 1985, 1991). Symptoms of HD progress relentlessly, with patients becoming severely demented, motorically dilapidated, unable to care for themselves, and eventually bedridden. There is no cure for the illness, and the only treatments currently available are either purely palliative or purely experimental. Death occurs an average of 15 to 17 years after disease onset (Folstein, 1989). Huntington’s disease causes untold suffering for those afflicted and their loved ones.",

      "abstract": "The progressive myoclonus epilepsies (PMEs) are a devastating group of rare disorders(1) that manifest with increasing action myoclonus, which is also present at rest but activates with stimuli such as noise, light, or touch. Ultimately, patients become wheelchair-bound and experience early death. Neurologic signs that frequently but not reliably coexist include other seizure types (particularly generalized tonic-clonic), progressive ataxia, and dementia. Typically, presentation is in late childhood or adolescence; however, all ages may be affected. Although distinction from more common forms of genetic generalized epilepsy, particularly juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, may be challenging early on, the presence or evolution of 1) progressive neurologic disability, 2) failure to respond to antiepileptic drug therapy, and 3) background slowing on EEG should suggest PME. Importantly, inappropriate therapy in the genetic generalized epilepsies may result in ataxia, impaired cognition, and uncontrolled seizures, which may mimic PME. PMEs should be distinguished from progressive encephalopathies with seizures (due to degenerative conditions such as GM2 gangliosidosis, nonketotic hyperglycinemia, Niemann-Pick type C, juvenile Huntington and Alzheimer disease) and progressive myoclonic ataxias, which affect predominantly adults with progressive ataxia, myoclonus, few if any tonic-clonic seizures, and without evidence of dementia.(2,3.)",

      "abstract": "Abstract 1,1-Difluoroethane (DFE) is a halogenated hydrocarbon that is commonly used as a propellant in air duster products. Herein, the pharmacology of DFE was reviewed, and questions relevant to medicolegal investigations were addressed. Particular emphasis was given to detection time in biological specimens and the range, onset and duration of effects. DFE may be abused as an inhalant and is rapidly absorbed through the lungs. Onset of central nervous system (CNS) depressant effects is within seconds and the duration may only last minutes. The effects may lead to impairment of human performance, including confusion, lethargy, impaired judgment, loss of motor coordination and loss of consciousness. Death may result even after the first use. With heavy use or in combination with other CNS depressants, extended periods of drowsiness or loss of consciousness may be observed with an increased risk of a fatal event. A majority of impaired driving investigations where DFE was identified included a collision demonstrating the significant impact its use may have on traffic safety. When DFE is identified alone, without other drugs that cause CNS impairment, the effects may not be observable minutes after the crash, making identification of its use difficult. Although concentrations dissipate rapidly, DFE has been detected in blood specimens collected up to 3 hours after the driving incident. Two studies on passive exposure presented herein demonstrated that it is unlikely to detect DFE above concentrations of ∼2.6 µg/mL in blood or urine due to even extreme unintentional exposure. Alternative specimens such as brain, lung and tracheal air should be considered in some postmortem investigations. DFE has been identified in blood specimens from postmortem cases at concentrations from 0.14 to 460 µg/mL and in impaired driving cases from 0.16 to 140 µg/mL.",

The disorder tends to develop before the age of 12. The resulting dysfunction interferes with the quality of social, academic, or workplace functioning, which cannot be explained by other mental disorders or personality disorders. The pathophysiology of ADHD is not well-established. Since ADHD is associated with dopamine and norepinephrine abnormalities, typical treatment strategies include drug therapy (methylphenidate, atomoxetine) combined with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), parental training, and other treatments. Predominant drug therapies may lead to adverse reactions such as digestive problems and growth restriction and do not produce a response in some cases. As a result, physical therapy is considered as an alternative option.",

The prevalence of akathisia in patients using classical antipsychotics is 20-30% and for users of clozapine, olanzapine and quetiapine (atypical antipsychotics) it is lower. Risk factors are a high dosage of antipsychotics, akathisia in a previous treatment, and diabetes mellitus. The treatment of akathisia starts, if possible, with the antipsychotic being withdrawn or the dose administered being lowered. Another treatment possibility is switching to clozapine, olanzapine or quetiapine, or adding a beta-blocking agent, an anticholinergic or mianserin.",

Auditory hallucinations were also associated with dystonia and may relate to tegmental pathology. This patient also manifested panic attacks independent of dystonia, visual illusions resembling post-hallucinogen perceptions, paranoia, bipolar mood disturbance, compulsions, generailzed anxiety (GA), dystonia and parkinsonism independent of delirium and panic, and myocionus. Neuropsychological findings are also presented. The conditions are discussed in relation to midbrain structures and clinical management. These disorders may relate to pathology of midbrain structures and tracts pertaining to serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, glutamate, cerebellum, reticular formation, and peripheral sensation. Carbamazepine (CBZ) improved bipolar disorder, paranola, panic, compulsions, and GA but low-dose CBZ actually exacerbated GA. Trihexyphenldyl (THP) improved dystonia and parkinsonism but worsened paranoia, panic, compulsions, and GA. THP improved dystonic frequency before reducing dystonic severity. Paroxetine improved illusions and dystonia but seemed to precipitate panic attacks, illusions resembled pannopsia and post-hallucinogen perceptual disorder and may relate to reduced stimulation of 5HT2 serotonin receptors. Careful clinical vigilance and planning are indicated when treating patients with midbrain pathology.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is a distinct disorder that is common, yet underrecognized and undertreated in primary care. Treating insomnia has been shown to improve outcomes, including reduced risk of developing cardiovascular and mental health disorders. Insomnia is influenced by the brain's regulation of sleep and wake, which are mutually exclusive events. Insomnia should be treated as a distinct condition, even when occurring with a comorbid diagnosis such as depression or anxiety. Clinicians should implement a multimodal approach to insomnia management, including nonpharmacologic interventions and pharmacologic therapy (when indicated). Pharmacologic agents that are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for insomnia include benzodiazepine receptor agonists (zolpidem, eszopiclone, and zaleplon), low-dose doxepin (tricyclic antidepressant), ramelteon (melatonin receptor agonist), and dual orexin receptor agonists (DORAs, daridorexant, lemborexant, and suvorexant). Unlike other pharmacologic agents, DORAs inhibit wakefulness rather than induce sedation. Additionally, these medications have no evidence of rebound insomnia or withdrawal, and little to no abuse potential. Daridorexant is the newest DORA, has an ideal half-life of 8 hours, and has demonstrated continued efficacy over a 12-month period. Selection of pharmacologic agent should be based on the patient's comorbid conditions, treatment goals and preferences, and other clinical characteristics.",

      "abstract": "The term \"sleep experiences\", coined by Watson (2001), denotes an array of unusual nocturnal consciousness phenomena; for example, nightmares, vivid or recurrent dreams, hypnagogic hallucinations, dreams of falling or flying, confusional arousals, and lucid dreams. Excluding the latter, these experiences reflect a single factor of atypical oneiric cognitions (\"general sleep experiences\"). The current study is an opinionated mini-review on the associations of this factor—measured with the Iowa sleep experiences survey (ISES, Watson, 2001)—with psychopathological symptoms and stress. Findings support a strong relation between psychological distress and general sleep experiences. It is suggested that that they should be viewed as a sleep disturbance; they seem to represent involuntary intrusions of wakefulness into sleep, resulting in aroused sleep. These intrusions may stem from excessively thin boundaries between consciousness states (e.g., \"transliminality\"), or, conversely, they may follow an attempt at disconnecting mental elements (e.g., dissociation), which paradoxically results in a \"rebound effect\". The extent to which unusual dreaming is experienced as intrusive, rather than controlled, may explain why general sleep experiences are related to psychopathology, whereas lucid dreams are related to psychological resilience. In conclusion, the exploration of the interplay between psychopathology and sleep should be expanded from focusing almost exclusively on quantitative aspects (e.g., sleep efficiency, latency) to including qualitative conscious experiences which may reflect poor sleep quality. Taking into account nocturnal consciousness—including unusual dreaming and permeable sleep-wake boundaries—may unveil rich information on night-time emotional states and broaden our definition of poor sleep quality.",

      "title": "The “Good Enough” Mood Stabilizer: A Review of the Clinical Evidence",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT A growing family of medications is used for mood stabilization in bipolar disorder. These medications fall into two broad categories according to likely mechanisms of action. Within the categories, specific drugs may vary in their efficacy for different phases of the disorder. The first category, including lithium, anticonvulsants, and some novel treatments, appears to have mechanisms related to intracellular second messengers. These medications have more pronounced antimanic than antidepressant effects, except for lamotrigine, which has antidepressant effects without precipitating mania. The second group of mood stabilizers is the atypical antipsychotics, which act through dopamine and other monoamines. Olanzapine and in all likelihood other drugs in the class possess marked, acute antimanic properties and possible antidepressant properties, but require further study before they can be used as routine options in long-term care. It is clear that the advent of multiple mood stabilizer candidates has not yet led to a single ideal therapy for bipolar disorder, but rather to options that can be flexibly tailored to the lifetime needs of individual patients, in sequences or combinations, and perhaps in conjunction with other classes of psychotropics.",

Many options are available to treat insomnia, to assist with either falling asleep (sleep onset) or maintaining sleep. We searched MEDLINE for articles published between January 1996 and January 2006, evaluated abstracts from recent professional meetings, and contacted the manufacturer of the most recent addition to the pharmacologic armamentarium for insomnia treatment (ramelteon) to gather information. Nonpharmacologic options include stimulus control, sleep hygiene education, sleep restriction, paradoxical intention, relaxation therapy, biofeedback, and cognitive behavioral therapy. Prescription and over‐the‐counter drug therapies include benzodiazepine and nonbenzodiazepine sedative‐hypnotic agents; ramelteon, a melatonin receptor agonist; trazodone; and sedating antihistamines. Herbal and alternative preparations include melatonin and valerian. Before recommending any treatment, clinicians should consider patient‐specific criteria such as age, medical history, and other drug use, as well as the underlying cause of the sleep disturbance. All pharmacotherapy should be used with appropriate caution, at minimum effective doses, and for minimum duration of time.",

Its pathophysiology involves an ischemic process, secondary to impairment of cerebral perfusion and its determinants and a neuroinflammatory process that includes endothelial activation, alteration of the blood–brain barrier and passage of neurotoxic mediators. Microcirculatory dysfunction is common to these two processes. This brain dysfunction is associated with increased mortality, morbidity and long-term cognitive disability. Its diagnosis relies essentially on neurological examination that can lead to specific investigations, including electrophysiological testing or neuroimaging. In practice, cerebrospinal fluid analysis is indisputably required when meningitis is suspected. Hepatic, uremic or respiratory encephalopathy, metabolic disturbances, drug overdose, sedative or opioid withdrawal, alcohol withdrawal delirium or Wernicke's encephalopathy are the main differential diagnoses. Currently, treatment consists mainly of controlling sepsis. The effects of insulin therapy and steroids need to be assessed.

      "title": "Clozapine Initiation for Schizophrenia: A Review of Clinical Effectiveness and Guidelines [Internet]",
      "abstract": "Clozapine is a second generation antipsychotic indicated for patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS). TRS is schizophrenia that does not respond fully to conventional schizophrenia treatments, including first-line antipsychotics. According to the Canadian Schizophrenia Guidelines (CSG), treatment-resistance is indicated after failure of two antipsychotics, although definitions of TRS vary among clinical trials. It has been estimated that in patients receiving conventional pharmacotherapy for schizophrenia, 50% of these patients do not respond adequately to prescribed pharmacotherapy (30% may exhibit a partial response, and 20% may exhibit no response).Clozapine is associated with a variety of side-effects, including drowsiness, dizziness, tachycardia (high resting heart rate), constipation, weight gain, lowered white blood cell count, and excess saliva production. Serious side effects include myocarditis, pericarditis, neutropenia, cardiomyopathy, and death. Some side effects, such as myocarditis, can occur relatively quickly (within two weeks) after initiation of the medication.Clozapine must be initiated at a low dose and titrated up to the therapeutic dose over time to avoid side effects. Therapeutic doses can range from 200 mg to 450 mg per day and are generally not exceeding 900 mg per day (although doses of more than 900 mg per day are possible).– Initiation of clozapine may start as low as 12.5 mg per day, titrating upwards until individual effectiveness is seen (for example, resolution of psychosis symptoms).,Initiation on clozapine requires strict monitoring protocols to ensure compliance and to address the side effects associated with the medication. For example, in the United States, the Clozapine Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy requires all prescribers and pharmacies to be certified in order to prescribe or dispense clozapine. Part of the Clozapine Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy program includes regular absolute neutrophil counts for patients on clozapine to monitor for neutropenia. In Canada, after reintroduction of clozapine in 1991 (after removal from the market in 1975 because of reported infections due to low white blood cell counts), patients were required to join a patient registry program (e.g., Sandoz Clozapine Risk Management Program1) to monitor white blood cell counts. When switching to a new brand of clozapine, patients must join the manufacturer-specific registry upon changing medications.Guidelines outlining appropriate use of clozapine are important to ensure timely, safe, and suitable prescribing of clozapine in a variety of settings. The objective of the current review is to summarize clinical effectiveness of clozapine during the initiation phase of treatment in adult patients with schizophrenia and summarize recommendations regarding monitoring of adult patients during this initiation phase.",

Downward saccades were mildly hypometric. Tongue movements were slow, jaw jerk was brisk, and pout and palmomontal reflexes were present. There was axial rigidity, bilateral mild limb rigidity, moderately severe bradykinesia in the arms, and micrographia. There was mild postural arm tremor, but no resting tremor. Left-arm ideomotor apraxia was noted. Limb reflexes were brisk without clonus, and plantar responses were flexor. Gait was slow and broad based, and there was mild postural instability. Cranial MRI scan (see Fig. 1) showed cerebral atrophy and bilateral, confluent, frontal white matter hyperintensity on fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and T2-weighted sequences containing patchy areas of restricted diffusion, which persisted on a repeat scan 3 months later. The MRI findings prompted a search for causes of cerebral vasculopathy. Intracranial magnetic resonance angiogram was normal. Inflammatory markers were normal, and there was no serological evidence of vasculitis. Other negative or normal results included the following: human immunodeficiency virus and treponemal serology; cerebrospinal fluid protein, glucose, cell count, oligoclonal bands and JC (john cunningham) virus polymerase chain reaction (PCR); C.A.D.A.S.I.L. (cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy) and M.E.L.A.S. (mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes) genetics; and plasma white cell and lysosomal enzymes and very-long-chain fatty acids. A heterozygous mutation in exon 18 of the CSF1R gene (c.2381T>C p.1794T) was found, confirming the diagnosis of HDLS. This mutation is pathogenic and was described in the seminal article.1 Family members were offered genetic counseling. Elements of clinical presentation with progressive, predominantly frontal, cognitive decline, and features of Parkinsonism (with levator inhibition, impaired vertical saccades, axial rigidity, symmetric bradykinesia, and postural instability) were suggestive of PSP. However, the abnormal MRI appearances prompted investigation for causes of leucoencephalopathy. The restricted diffusion on MRI, together with the complaint of headaches, made cerebral vasculitis an important consideration. However, restricted diffusion on MRI persisting 3 months later is not the result of acute infarction; this MRI feature, probably caused by high-grade intramyelinic edema, has been reported in HDLS3 and in other leukodystrophies.4 Parkinsonism has been described in HDLS5 and, as with our patient, is unresponsive to levodopa. It is likely that HDLS is under-recognized. The recent discovery of the genetic cause1 obviates the need for brain biopsy and allows swift diagnosis of a disorder previously often diagnosed at postmortem. We highlight another cause of “atypical” parkinsonism with features of PSP.6 HDLS should be considered in cases of atypical parkinsonism with cognitive decline and appropriate cranial MRI appearances, even in the absence of an obvious family history of similar illness.

      "abstract": "Most extrapyramidal side effects of neuroleptics are easily recognized and cause little problem in diagnosis and treatment. The exceptions are those which mimic psychopathology: akathesia and akinisia. Akathesia resembles anxiety. Akinesia is similar to depression, residual schizophrenia, and demoralization. Differential diagnosis may require interruption of the neuroleptic. Whether neuroleptics can cause depression not associated with akinesia has never been established. The first obligation of the clinician is to be sure that the depressive symptoms are not concomitants of akinesia, before treating with antidepressants which may not be the appropriate treatment. There is no convincing evidence that one neuroleptic drug is more likely to cause akinesia than another, although this had not been studied extensively using a broad definition of akinesia.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a mental disorder that makes an individual responsive to negative stimuli as higher cognitive functions of the brain of the individual like perception, attention, memory related functions, planning, decision making etc. are seriously challenged by the causes like excessive stresses in life, serious illness, loss of self-esteem, certain medications etc. Erroneous information processing in the brain of depressive individuals attaches them to the feelings of loss, sadness and hopelessness. In extremely stressful situation the cognitive functions of the depressive individuals may impaired to such an extent that they may have the feeling of entrapment for which they may take the way of suicidal acts for escape. A number of brain regions that are involved in higher cognitive functions are altered in depression patients, suicidal individuals and in complete suicides. Along with the morphological changes, monoaminergic neurotransmission system is also severely deteriorated in these brain regions indicating their possible involvements in regulating cognitive activities. Monoaminergic dysfunctions may give rise to serious cognitive impairments and deterioration of associated mental functions required for maintaining normal internal homeostasis. Loss of cognitive functions makes an individual incapable to interact properly to various aspects of normal life functions making them depressive and severe depression may be the forerunner of suicidal acts.",

      "title": "Narcolepsy – Between the dream and reality",
      "abstract": "“One day I dreamt that I was awake and when I awoke I was sleeping – this phrase might seem funny, but not for those who suffer from Narcolepsy. How many times I thought I was living a real scene and when I woke up I found out that everything was just another dream. Dream, fantasy, things of my mind, like some people used to say, I did not know for sure what was happening: just knew that it was something new, strange and with no apparent explanation. Suddenly, an incontrollable sleep and there I was, sleeping anywhere, independently of the moment or the situation. Laziness, tiredness, stress, I could not really explain the reason”\r\n\r\nThis text was written by Antonio Geraldo, a patient with narcolepsy/cataplexy, hospitalized for fractures in both ankles after falling from a stair with 5 meters high due to excessive sleepiness.\r\n\r\nWe have evolved a lot in terms of knowledge about narcolepsy. We already know the strong correlation between genetics (presence of the allele HLA-DQB1⁎0602) and ambient factors (viral infections and vaccinations), resulting in a mechanism of autoimmunity [1–3]. There is also a major knowledge of the illness׳s physiopathology with the discovery of hypocretin and its connections with the Central Nervous System from the lateral hypothalamus [4,5]. We have evolved also in the pharmacological treatment with the development of new drugs for the control of the excessive diurnal sleepiness and of cataplexy [6,7]. However, the average time for the diagnosis is still above 10 years in men and may be higher than 20 years in women, depending on the country of origin [8].\r\n\r\nThe main factors responsible for this delay in diagnosis and the beginning of treatment of these patients are the lack of information and basic knowledge among the general population, the failure in recognizing the signs and symptoms by the health professionals, besides the lack of Specialized Centers for the diagnosis and treatment of narcolepsy [9]. This delay in diagnosing takes most of these patients to a life of hopelessness, prejudice and irreparable losses in education and character development [10]. After diagnosis, what we do is treat these patients with medications that improve their sleepiness and the cataplexy. The treatment is still purely symptomatic [6]. We do not modify the high prevalence of depression, neither, the progressive weight gain which normally might lead to other complications during the disease׳s evolution.\r\n\r\nIn this particular sense, some authors describe a higher mortality rate among the narcoleptic population, although the main causes are still undetermined [11]. A doctorate thesis in our department has demonstrated that the aerobic performance of these patients with narcolepsy was worse than the performance found in patients with sleep obstructive apnea. This has led us to imagine a possible alteration in the metabolism of these patients with probable impairment of their quality of life. These data open several new scientific horizons to be researched, but also bring much more responsibility upon diagnosis and treatment of this disease.\r\n\r\nParaphrasing our patient, Antonio Geraldo: “Laziness, tiredness, stress, I could not even explain”. Interestingly, we also cannot explain!\r\n\r\nThis special text about narcolepsy brings to the reader a very interesting panorama about narcolepsy. We have relevant scientific knowledge, experience with dedicated groups for the treatment and study of patients with narcolepsy, besides several interesting clinical and mysterious cases. We want to invite everyone to read, learn, spread and try to explain",

      "abstract": "Neurological outcome after preterm birth refers to neurologically defined conditions due to disorders of the motor system – e.g. spasticity, dyskinesia or ataxia – which are commonly summarized under the term “cerebral palsy” (CP). Studies of CP in relation to birth weight (BW) and gestational age (GA) estimate that infants of very low birth weight (VLBW); i.e., of BW less than 1500 g, or very immature infants; i.e., with GA less than 32 weeks, are between 40 and 100 times more likely to have CP than normal BW infants or infants born at term [1, 2]. No other disability associated with preterm birth, such as learning impairments, mental retardation, behavioral problems or sensorineural deficits, shows such a high difference in prevalence in relation to birth at term or normal BW. This means that CP following preterm birth, or brain compromise affecting the motor system, is probably related to a pathomechanism specifically affecting the immature brain, which stresses the importance of gaining insight into the following questions:",

      "title": "Post-operative central anticholinergic syndrome",
      "abstract": "Central anticholinergic syndrome is defined as an absolute or relative reduction in cholinergic activity in the central nervous system [1]. In anaesthetic practice the syndrome was originally described in connection with drugs with central anticholinergic actions, such as hyoscine butylbromide (scopolamine) [2]. Later, many other drugs with no direct anticholinergic effects were implicated. This may be by modulation of other neurotransmitters which reduce cholinergic activity, but the mechanisms by which the syndrome occurs have not been fully explained [1]. The reported clinical features of the central anticholinergic syndrome in the post-operative period are non-specific. If they are all components of the syndrome the central nervous system would be widely involved (Table 1). There are said to be two forms of the syndrome: hyperactive or depressed. Peripheral anticholinergic symptoms may also occur but could by masked by peripheral cholinesterase inhibitors. Diagnosis rests on clinical features, exclusion of other conditions, and a positive response to a centrally acting cholinesterase inhibitor, usually physostigmine [1].Table 1: Reported clinical features of post-operative central anticholinergic syndrome The incidence of the post-operative syndrome has been estimated as 9.4% after general anaesthesia and 3.3% after regional anaesthesia with sedation [1], although an incidence as high as 40% has been claimed [5]. In their paper in this issue of the journal [6], Link et al. report an incidence of 1.9% in a broad mix of 962 adults after general anaesthesia, with a subgroup of women recovering from major gynaecological surgery having an incidence of 10%. These figures are in stark contrast with experience in the UK where central anticholinergic syndrome is diagnosed rarely. United Kingdom anaesthetists are either unaware of the syndrome, or do not believe it exists. Choice of anaesthetic technique and drugs may be an important determinant of reported incidence. Anaesthetists who use long acting drugs (benzodiazepines or barbiturates) will see a large number of patients who recover slowly from anaesthesia. Link et al. state that less than 3% of their study population were given droperidol as part of their anaesthetic, but eight of 18 patients with the syndrome received between 2.5 and 25 mg. The total number of patients given diazepam and phenobarbitone premedication is not stated, but nine of 18 affected patients received one of these drugs. What constitutes normal recovery from anaesthesia and a definition of what is abnormally prolonged are not stated. Clearly, the earlier that features of the syndrome are sought the higher will be their incidence in the post-operative period. Interindividual variations in anaesthetic drugs and technique, as well as variations in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, must also be taken into account. From the clinical features it is obvious that the list of differential diagnoses is long. As there is no diagnostic test, the diagnosis is made by exclusion of hypoxia, hypercapnia, hyperthermia, hypothermia, urea and electrolyte and acid-base disturbances, endocrine abnormalities, and neurological disturbance from surgery, vascular disease or trauma [1]. The extensive list of symptoms and signs means that central anticholinergic syndrome is a potential diagnosis in patients with just about any form of neurological abnormality, and that the incidence could be inversely proportional to the rigour with which other diagnoses are excluded. In some settings, rigorous exclusion of all other conditions may be simply impossible in the immediate post-operative period. The diagnosis, therefore, is heavily dependent on a response to physostigmine, whose central effects extend beyond the cholinergic system [7,8]. Perhaps central anticholinergic syndrome is a misnomer, and central physostigmine responsive syndrome is a more accurate description. This does not mean that post-operative central anticholinergic syndrome should be dismissed out of hand. The case report by Sun [9] cannot easily be explained by any other diagnosis. This is a report of three general anaesthetics in one patient, who took 14 and 10 h to regain full consciousness after repair of retinal detachment under general anaesthesia that included reversal of neuromuscular blockade with neostigmine and atropine. On the third occasion, an identical anaesthetic to the second was given but without reversal of neuromuscular blockade. This time the patient was fully conscious 10 min after the end of the anaesthesia. Physostigmine was not available in the hospital involved. Physostigmine shortens wakening times after general anaesthesia [10]. However, its duration of action is about 30–60 min after intravenous (i.v.) injection [11] and, in common with other 'antidotes' such as naloxone and flumazenil, there is a danger of later recurrence of symptoms. Reported side effects of physostigmine in this setting include nausea and vomiting, abdominal cramps [10,12,13] and bradycardia and hypotension [13]. It would therefore seem appropriate to avoid treating one drug's side effects with another drug that exposes patients to other risks. We should accept that some patients recover from anaesthesia more slowly than others, and perhaps the safest course of action is to observe and support them during this time. Careful choice of anaesthetic technique and drugs tailored to individual circumstances should reduce the need for prolonged support. Until a more rigid definition is available, preferably supported by a controlled trial, differences in the reported incidence of post-operative central anticholinergic syndrome seem likely to continue.

The meninges and the skull are well formed, which is consistent with earlier normal embryogenesis of the telencephalon. Bilateral occlusion of the internal carotid arteries in utero is a potential mechanism. Clinical features include intact brainstem reflexes without evidence of higher cortical activity. The infant's head size and the spontaneous reflexes such as sucking, swallowing, crying, and moving the arms and legs may all seem normal at birth. However, after a few weeks the infant usually becomes irritable and has increased muscle tone and after a few months of life, seizures and hydrocephalus (excessive accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain) may develop. Other symptoms may include visual impairment, lack of growth, deafness, blindness, spastic quadriparesis (paralysis), and intellectual deficits. Since the early behaviour appears to be relatively normal, the diagnosis may be delayed for months sometimes. There is no definitive treatment for hydranencephaly. The outlook for children with hydranencephaly is generally poor, and many children with this disorder die before their first birthday.",

      "abstract": "Abstract A 28-year-old man survived midbrain trauma. A diurnally varying dystonia-parkinsonism-delirium-panic syndrome emerged after 1 year. Auditory hallucinations were also associated with dystonia and may relate to tegmental pathology. This patient also manifested panic attacks independent of dystonia, visual illusions resembling post-hallucinogen perceptions, paranoia, bipolar mood disturbance, compulsions, generailzed anxiety (GA), dystonia and parkinsonism independent of delirium and panic, and myocionus. Neuropsychological findings are also presented. The conditions are discussed in relation to midbrain structures and clinical management. These disorders may relate to pathology of midbrain structures and tracts pertaining to serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, glutamate, cerebellum, reticular formation, and peripheral sensation. Carbamazepine (CBZ) improved bipolar disorder, paranola, panic, compulsions, and GA but low-dose CBZ actually exacerbated GA. Trihexyphenldyl (THP) improved dystonia and parkinsonism but worsened paranoia, panic, compulsions, and GA. THP improved dystonic frequency before reducing dystonic severity. Paroxetine improved illusions and dystonia but seemed to precipitate panic attacks, illusions resembled pannopsia and post-hallucinogen perceptual disorder and may relate to reduced stimulation of 5HT2 serotonin receptors. Careful clinical vigilance and planning are indicated when treating patients with midbrain pathology.",

A polissonografia (PSG) e considerada padrao-ouro para sua identificacao. O diagnostico de SAHOS considera o numero de eventos respiratorios obstrutivos durante o sono e as manifestacoes clinicas resultantes desses eventos. Esta revisao aborda a apresentacao clinica da SAHOS, seus principais sinais/sintomas e a identificacao de fatores de risco que faci litam seu reconhecimento. Os sinais e sintomas mais comuns sao: ronco, sono nao restaurador, paradas respiratorias durante o sono, insonia, sonolencia diurna, fadiga e falta de concentracao. Os pacientes tambem podem referir cefaleia matinal, irritabilidade e depressao. A SAHOS e mais comum e mais grave em homens acima de 55 anos. A obesidade e o fator de risco mais importante. Alteracoes anatomicas craniofaciais podem causar reducao do calibre das vias aereas. Sendo a PSG um exame complexo e de custo elevado, instrumentos para uso na pratica clinica tem sido validados, destacando-se a Escala de Sonolencia de Epworth e o Questionario de Berlim. O treinamento de medicos da atencao basica e a disponibilidade de especialistas do sono com a incorporacao da historia do sono na anamnese e a utilizacao de instrumentos simples de rastreamento podem reduzir a subidentificacao da SAHOS, possibilitando o tratamento de um numero maior de pacientes e a prevencao de complicacoes associadas.

      "abstract": "The following practical issues in psychopharmacotherapy of patients with mental retardation (MR) or other developmental disability (DD) are discussed, with some theoretical speculations: Persons with MR/DD have high rates of psychiatric disorders/symptoms, many of which are drug-responsive and not satisfactorily treated with other modalities alone. However, diagnosis is often complicated by concurrent multiple disorders (both psychiatric and medical/surgical), masking or distortion of symptoms, and communication impairments. Comorbidity and associated treatments should be considered in medication choice. Compared to psychiatric patients of normal IQ, patients with MR may be more sensitive to side effects and toxicity as well as responsive to lower doses, possibly related to less neuronal substrate, qualitative brain differences, or developmental stage. Unexpected or disappointing drug responses may also be related to such statistical quirks as \"end-of-curve\" phenomena. Ripples, ratcheting, and other ecobehavioral considerations influence treatment outcome and drug management. Target symptoms and expected drug benefits should be defined in consultation with caregivers as well as, when possible, the patient. Because drug responses of patients with MR are especially unpredictable, unreliable, sensitive to dose, and fraught with side effects, each medication trial might ideally be approached as a single-subject experiment on a compassionate protocol: quantify the baseline with ratings, behavior counts or other objective measures; start low and titrate slowly; monitor progress with repeated objective measures.",

      "title": "Daytime Drowsiness",
      "abstract": "Drowsiness is common in those with DLB and PDD, and can interfere with thinking and memory, as well as quality of life. There are a variety of potential reasons for this, many treatable. Getting a little sleepy during a boring task or napping after lunch on the weekend is not a sign of a medical problem. However, daytime drowsiness should draw attention in certain circumstances: 1. More than one nap most days, or near-daily naps that span 2 to 3 hours 2. Falling asleep during conversations or eating 3. Frequently falling asleep during reading, watching TV, doing computer work or other vigilant tasks 4. Returning to sleep after breakfast These are signs that could indicate that nighttime sleep was not adequate (nonrestorative) but could have other explanations. Daytime drowsiness has limited causes: 1. Insomnia at bedtime 2. Awakening during the night 3. Insufficient time spent in bed at night 4. Poor quality sleep at night (despite adequate time in bed) 5. Daytime medications inducing drowsiness 6. A primary sleep disorder directly causing drowsiness (which may be DLB or PDD related) We will explore each of these possible causes and how they might be diagnosed and treated. If a person with DLB or PDD is excessively drowsy, at least one of these could be the problem. Inability to get to sleep at bedtime can translate into sleepiness during the daytime. Many people with DLB or PDD who experience insomnia benefit from nighttime carbidopa/levodopa doses. The benefits of carbidopa/levodopa dosing at bedtime for Lewy-related insomnia were addressed in Chapter 9. Various other factors, however, may contribute to insomnia. Sometimes medications taken in the evening are alerting. Such drugs include duloxetine (Cymbalta) or venlafaxine (Effexor), used for depression and often dosed twice daily. Elimination of all but the morning dose may allow sleep in such cases. Other drugs for depression from the Prozac class (SSRIs; see the list in Chapter 18) may also cause insomnia if taken at bedtime. A simple strategy is to simply switch to morning dosing on a trial basis. The tricyclic antidepressants, such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, or protriptyline, should not cause insomnia; they may induce sleep. Occasionally, sleepy people are prescribed stimulants with long-acting properties, such as extended-release methylphenidate (Concerta), modafinil (Provigil), or armodafinil (Nuvigil).",

      "abstract": "Unproved methods and controversial theories in the diagnosis and management of allergy/immunology are those that lack scientific credibility. Some definitions are provided for perspective, as in chronic medical conditions, frequently nonscientifically based treatments are developed that can have a profound psychological effect on the patients in the absence of objective physical benefit. Standard practice uses methods of diagnosis and treatment used by reputable physicians in a particular subspecialty or primary care practice, with the understanding that diagnosis and treatment options are consistent with established mechanisms of conditions or diseases. Conventional medicine (Western or allopathic medicine) is that which is practiced by the majority of physicians, osteopaths, psychologists, registered nurses, and physical therapists. Complementary medicine involves diverse practices or products that are used with the practice of conventional medicine, such as using acupuncture in addition to opioids for pain relief. Alternative medicine implies use of complementary practices in place of conventional medicine. Unproved and controversial methods and theories do not have supporting data, validation, or sufficient scientific scrutiny, and they should not be used in the practice of allergy/immunology. Some examples of unproven theories about allergic/immunologic conditions include allergic toxemia, idiopathic environmental intolerance, and toxic disease from indoor molds. Unconventional diagnostic methods for allergic conditions include cytotoxic tests, provocation-neutralization, electrodermal diagnosis, applied kinesiology assessments, chemical analysis of body fluids, and serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) or IgG4 testing. Unproven treatments and intervention methods for allergic/immunologic conditions include acupuncture, homeopathy, halotherapy, and autogenous urine injections.",

      "title": "Smartphone addiction through age and gender during Italian lockdown for COVID-19",
      "abstract": "Background: Nomophobia (no-mobile-phobia or Disconnection Syndrome) is the fear of not being able to consult your mobile phone, not being connected or traceable. This is an addiction to excessive smartphone usage related to the constant need to consult it to view notifications and updates. Like other forms of addiction, nomophobia is associated with excessive behaviors that lead to an increasing use of the phone to the point where it cannot do without it and the need to take it with it to any place or circumstance. The fear of not being connected consequently evokes reactions of excessive anxiety with specific physiological related (e.g., breathlessness, sweating, tremor, heart acceleration, sweating etc.). Nomophobia, however, is not included in anxiety disorders but is part of the pathological addictions to which it responds adequately. In fact, there are many behavioral and emotional analogies with other forms of addiction (including gambling) so the hypothesis that the abuse of the smartphone should be categorized as a real addiction can be accepted. The dependencies associated with the Internet and technologies that can be defined Dependencies 2.0, include the smartphone. During the Italian lockdown caused by COVID-19, the use of technologies has been the fundamental basis of adaptation for smart working, school and professional training, which has led to a change in the population lifestyle. Objective: The purpose of this work is to document the level of smartphone dependence that has occurred during the COVID-19 lockdown period. Material and Methods: The NoMobilePhobia-Questionnaire (NMP-Q) was presented online to 1264 participants between the ages of 15 and 60. With regard to the selection of participants, approximately between the ages of 15 and 60, we used the method of random numbers: in fact, one participant for every hundred inhabitants was chosen in a randomized way. Finally, it was necessary for all participants to have access to the Internet. These dynamics have been acquitted in order to give us a valid representative sample. Results: The results show no significant main effects for the two factors taken into account (Gender and Age of participants). However the significant interaction shows that female participants reported on average higher scores on NoMobilePhobia-Questionnaire (NMP-Q) than males , for the younger age group (15 to 44), while for those over the age of 44, the average highest scores were for male participants. The main effects of the \"Sex\" factor [F(1,1256)= 3.179 and p=0.75] and \"Age_class\" [F(4,1253)=1.82 and p=0.12] are not significant; the interaction between the Sex-Age_class factors is significant with F(4,1253) =7.06 and p<.001 and an observed power close to 1 (0.99). The correlation between the Variable \"Score\" and the measure of the \"Age\" was found to be significant (negative) linear relationship (r of Pearson =-.093 and p<.001) considering the whole sample. Conclusions: One of the \"positive\" aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic is the use of the Internet and smartphones, and our analysis aimed to document the frequency of use in the Italian context with the NoMobilePhobia-Questionnaire. The results reveal the risk in some parts of the Italian population to develop forms of smartphone dependence, especially in circumstances that prohibit direct social interactions.",

      "title": "Adverse effects from atypical antipsychotics",
      "abstract": "Antipsychotics are considered the mainstay of treatment for psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorders. While the first generation antipsychotics (typical antipsychotics) are effective for treating psychosis, the second generation antipsychotics (atypical antipsychotics) have largely supplanted their older cousins as the \"go to\" medications for this indication. The main reason for the switch to newer agents is not because of increased efficacy, but because of reduced adverse effect burden. The reduced propensity of the second generation antipsychotics to cause neurological adverse effects such as extrapyramidal symptoms and tardive dyskinesia has been established. However, these agents have a different adverse effect profile that may carry as much \"baggage\" as the older agents. Adverse effects such as weight gain, hyperglycemia, hyper- or dyslipidemia, and hyperprolactinemia are all fairly common occurrences with these agents. Other serious adverse effects, including neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) or pulmonary embolism, may also occur. This issue of the Mental Health Clinician (MHC) will explore these non-neurologic adverse effects caused by second generation antipsychotics.First, an article reviewing management and prevention of clozapine-induced agranulocytosis describes some of the challenges when using this \"last-resort\" second generation antipsychotic. Case reports describing aripiprazole induced hiccups and a pulmonary embolism related to risperidone and paliperidone are included in this issue. Another case report examines treating hyperprolactinemia with bromocriptine. Also, original research on the link between osteoporosis and the use of antipsychotics is presented to further explore the concept of second generation antipsychotic induced hyperprolactinemia. In addition to a review article examining the clinical characteristics of NMS and serotonin syndrome, a case is presented describing a neurotoxic adverse event that illustrates the difficulty in differentiating NMS and serotonin syndrome.One of the most challenging aspects of using second generation antipsychotics is monitoring, preventing, and treating metabolic adverse effects. This issue includes a Toolbox describing the average weight gain and changes in other metabolic parameters seen with second generation antipsychotics to aid clinicians in determining the most appropriate medication for their patient. A review article discussing prevention and treatment strategies for metabolic adverse effects as well as original research detailing a pharmacist-driven intervention for baseline monitoring of these effects are contained within this issue.When using second generation antipsychotics in our psychiatric patients, adverse effects are likely to occur. Hopefully, this issue of the MHC will educate the CPNP membership and assist clinicians in providing better care for patients receiving these medications.",

The danger associated with the behavior is seemingly less than that of the drug use it replaced. This trade-off underscores the complexity of the clinician's risk-benefit analysis in determining whether a behavior requires treatment. Although the patient appeared to have suffered no physiological damage as a result of hyperventilating, his mental status changes and the potential for other changes warranted close observation of this behavior. Electroencephalogram, electrocardiogram, and electrolyte changes, hypoxemia, apnea, and injury from loss of consciousness and falling are all possible sequelae (3,4,6). In addition, like other self-stimulating behaviors performed excessively, voluntary hyperventilation can foster social isolation and alienation, particularly if performed to the exclusion of ordinary daily routines.",

      "abstract": "Shock as a result of simple anesthesia in the absence of trauma, hemorrhage or fright has not been carefully worked out. The term \"shock\" is unscientific. It is the clinical expression for a group of symptoms, the result of failure of important functions of the body, as those of circulation, respiration, excretion and secretion, and general metabolism. A lowered bodily temperature is a more or less constant phenomenon. Shock is intimately connected with the nervous mechanism. In studying shock from anesthesia it is not only essential to consider the specific toxin of the anesthetic used, but the resulting toxic bodies generated through the immediate or more remote influence of general anesthesia. Shock can not, therefore, be expressed in a single definition. The phenomena of shock are so complex that in experimental work on animals it is necessary to study each condition separately, and compile the associated facts obtained and compare",

      "abstract": "AD and other types of dementias are associated with many problematic behaviors. Noncognitive feature is a terminology that draws the distinction between cognitive loss and the heterogeneous group of symptoms that include psychiatric symptoms such as depression, hallucinations, delusions and misidentifications. This term also includes behavioral disturbances such as aggression, agitation, pacing and eating disorders (Burns et al., 1990). An alternative expression is neuropsychiatric features (Cummings et al., 1994). The term \"Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of Dementia\" (BPSD) has also been defined as \"symptoms of disturbed perception, thought content, mood and behavior that frequently occur in patients with dementia\" (Consensus Conference on the Behavioral Disturbances of Dementia, 1996). Noncognitive disorders can cause distress both to patients and carers. Such changes are often a determinant for institutional care. A study reported that psychotic symptoms (e.g., hallucinations and delusions) were present in about 50% of patients with dementia and disruptive behavior (e.g., physical violence, hiding things, wandering, demanding or critical behavior) in up to 70% (Rabins et al., 1982). These include hitting, yelling, grabbing people, wandering, hoarding, and repetitive gestures and questioning (Moak & Fisher, 1990; Reisberg et al., 1987). All of these problematic behaviors are often grouped together as \"agitation\" or \"agitated behavior\".",

      "abstract": "Abstract Rationale, aims and objective We questioned: what kind of relationships between mental and neurobiological levels of complexity is or could become useful in the psychiatric practice? The concept of mind and associated mood states defended here is that they are physically emergent, subjective, qualitative, unified features of the brain. We compared our neurobiological assessment also to psychoanalytical practice (first person's perspective). Argument Applied to recent work on major depressive disorder ( MDD ), our ideas are among other supported by clinical and experimental studies on sleep deprivation, deep brain stimulation and epidemiological assessments of time‐to‐recovery. Clinical implications We suggest that depression is a transient state of the brain, that is mutually exclusive to the state of pleasure (in the F reudian context), rather than a disorder or disease with a characteristic time course (like many reversible somatic diseases). MDD can best be described with stochastic transition models, which is discussed in the context of a presumed brain serotonin dysfunction in depression. Our ideas invite a reconsideration of some concepts underlying current diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in the clinical practice.",

Argininemia is a disorder in which the clinical picture is quite different from the other disorers of the urea cycle. Patients with argininemia are often recognized as abnormal because of failure to pass developmental milestones. With the advent of spasticity or opisthotonus, they may be first thought to have cerebral palsy. Patients with argininemia may have episodic vomiting and hyperammonemia. The clinical features may include progressive gait abnormalities due to spasticity, as well as acute episodes of ataxia, behavior disturbances (aggression, hyperactivity, and irritability), vomiting, lethargy, and seizures.",

      "title": "Correct understanding of the definition and management strategies for refractory hydrocephalus",
      "abstract": "Hydrocephalus refers to the abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the central nervous system, typically resulting from an imbalance between CSF production and absorption. Traditional classifications of hydrocephalus do not incorporate management strategies (not classified according to the degree of difficulty of treatment). Clinically, hydrocephalus that is challenging to treat is often categorized as refractory hydrocephalus (RH). However, the absence of a unified definition of RH impedes the standardization of treatment approaches, raising clinical dilemmas. This article explores the definition, etiologies, classification, and management strategies for RH. Based on the literature and the Diagnosis-Related Group payment system principles, RH is clinically defined as progressive hydrocephalus meeting one or more of the following criteria: (1) the absence of significant clinical or radiological improvement within 60 days despite standard interventions, usually due to pathological factors, such as abnormal CSF characteristics, (2) inability to achieve curative surgical treatments attributable to complex anatomy such as abnormal dynamic changes or multiloculated compartments, and (3) failure to respond after two consecutive therapeutic procedures. RH consists of six distinct subtypes, with infectious hydrocephalus being the most common, followed by low-pressure hydrocephalus. Temporary management strategies for RH must be carefully tailored to patient-specific characteristics, considering the risk-benefit analysis of available measures. In cases of infectious RH, achieving CSF sterilization and evaluating the results are crucial. Curative surgery for infectious RH should be performed only after CSF has been completely sterilized to normal levels. In low-pressure RH, a critical focus is identifying and addressing the sites receiving CSF.",

      "title": "Emergence Delirium in children",
      "abstract": "Delirium after anesthesia, also known as emergence delirium (ED) is a clinical condition in which patients have alterations to their attention, awareness, and perceptions. In children, this often results in behavioral disturbances such as crying, sobbing, thrashing and disorientation. Emergence Agitation (EA) and Emergence Delirium (ED) are commonly used interchangeably; they describe two distinct conditions with emergence delirium being described in the anesthesia literature as a state of mental confusion, agitation, and dis-inhibition marked by some degree of hyper-excitability during recovery from general anesthesia. The commonly reported incidence of emergence delirium is about 10% to 30% of paediatric patients. Risk factors associated with emergence delirium are age, preexisting behaviours, types of surgery and the use of volatile anaesthesia. Transient agitation - delirium from sevoflurane anesthesia can lead to a variety of adverse events, such as airway spasm, shedding or displaced tracheal tube, dehiscence, or bleeding. Volatile anaesthetics may affect brain activity by interfering with the balance between neuronal synaptic inhibition and excitation in the central nervous system. Elevated postoperative pain has been suggested to underlie ED. But given that ED is seen in patients undergoing MRI, pain cannot be the sole cause. Treatment options include the use of premedication, analgesic adjuvants, single dose of propofol at the conclusion of the case. Midazolam premedication, intraoperative dexmedetomidine and fentanyl were associated with lower incidence of ED. The incidence of ED in patients receiving propofol is markedly lower than those receiving sevoflurane, despite the similar rapid emergence profile of both agents. Paediatric Assessment of Emergence Delirium (PAED) scale, developed specifically for children, is a valid and reliable scale. Watcha score is a simpler, reliable tool to measure emergence behaviour. There has been considerable progress in the neuroscience of anaesthesia and the application of new pharmacological agents, but the mystery behind the exact mechanism of ED is elusive. ED is a diagnosis of exclusion once other causes have been dismiss. There is no strong evidence of long-term effects and outcomes in children who developed emergence delirium after anesthesia. Prevention may be the best treatment but no one medication is entirely effective.",

      "abstract": "Despite precise definitions and exclusions for 19 syndromes of neuropsychiatric systemic lupus erythematosus (NPSLE), under some circumstances it appears to be difficult to differentiate whether neuropsychiatric symptoms are caused by SLE or by other reasons such as primary mental disorders or substance-induced mood disorders, especially induced by glucocorticoids or antimalarials. We report the case of a male patient with SLE who presented with an exacerbation of bipolar disorder triggered by chloroquine. Firstly, when the patient was diagnosed with SLE, he underwent six months of therapy with chloroquine without any psychiatric symptoms. Later, the SLE returned and the patient was prescribed chloroquine again, without any mental illness. When the third exacerbation of SLE occurred, it coincided with a severe depressive episode with psychotic features that became aggravated for the first time after the administration of chloroquine. The chloroquine was subsequently replaced with hydroxychloroquine for the next six months without any behavioral problems, following which, the SLE and mood disorder were in remission. Later, a bipolar disorder relapse occurred, manifested by a manic episode, and in the following three months, despite psychiatric treatment, a manic episode with psychotic features developed four days after chloroquine was prescribed for arthritis. It was the second time that the mood disorder was exacerbated by chloroquine. Since that time, chloroquine has been withdrawn. Currently the patient is undergoing treatment with hydroxychloroquine and psychiatric drugs with good response. Our case points out that although chloroquine-induced psychosis is rare, patients presenting with behavioral changes need physicians’ attention in order to diagnose early and efficiently treat encountered mood disorders.",

According to current researches, it has been noted that many people all over the world are suffering from one or more symptoms of insomnia. Depending on duration of problem, it may be classified as transient insomnia, short term insomnia and chronic insomnia. Insomnia is described as saher in ancient classical Unani literature. The causes of insomnia are stress, depression, anxiety, medical conditions, drugs, irregular schedule, caffeine, etc. According to Unani system of medicine, health is attributed to the equilibrium of Akhlat (Humors), beside this, there is Asbab sitta zarooriya (Six essential factors) there are air, food and drinks, bodily movement and repose (Harkat sukoon badni), mental activity and repose, (Harkat wa sukoon nafsani), sleep and wakefulness (Naumwayaqza) and retention and excretion (Ahtabas wa Istefrag); any imbalance any of the above factors is likely to cause the disease. Normal sleep is thought to be because of rutubat wa broodat i.e., wetness and cold in our body, and if there is derailment of balance in sleep and wakefulness, it implies the predominance of yaboosat wa hararat i.e. dryness and hotness extensive in the brain. Dalak (Massage) is a systematic manipulation of body tissues with the hand.

This disease is characterized by a combination of disorders: cognitive (impaired attention, memory, thinking) and behavioral, productive (hallucinatory, delusional, affective, etc.) and negative (apathy, abulia, emotional and social detachment, etc.) symptoms. Schizophrenia causes psychosis, can be accompanied by disability and negatively affect all areas of life, including personal, social life, family and work activities. This disease is also characterized by changes in emotions, loss of concentration, autism, asociality (\"immersion in oneself\", unusual thoughts and fantasies), a drop in energy state and a violation of the will. The sick person does not understand that he is ill, and this complicates treatment. Psychoses become more frequent over time and this leads to frequent hallucinations, and they can affect all the senses. The most common are auditory hallucinations in the form of voices and a person's subordination to voices, which can make the situation dangerous. The absence of treatment for schizophrenia leads to an absolute loss of one's own \"I\", loss of a person's personality, and during an exacerbation of the disease, a person can harm first of all himself and then others. The following research article examines all the factors that can influence the onset and progression of the disease.",

Hallucinations were found to be nonspecific. Most patients who had hallucinations involving one sensory modality had experienced in the past hallucinations involving other sensory modalities. The hallucinations accompanying acute schizophrenia more closely resembled those seen in affective disorder than in chronic schizophrenia, but no type of hallucination was diagnostic in the sense of occurring significantly more often in one illness than in another. Auditory hallucinations occurred almost as often in affective disorder as in schizophrenia; visual hallucinations were common in all five disorders; and derogatory voices, widely believed to signify depression, occurred most often in schizophrenia.",

Les propriétés intrinsèques des molécules peuvent expliquer certaines manifestations. Il semble, parmi les médicaments, que l'incidence des convulsions induites par les antidépresseurs tricycliques était particulièrement importante. Parmi les substances illicites, l'utilisation accrue des psychostimulants, principalement de la cocaïne, s'accompagne également fréquemment de convulsions. Les crises convulsives induites par des toxiques sont souvent uniques et de courte durée, cédant parfois avant tout traitement. Elles peuvent cependant évoluer vers un état de mal épileptique. Si les mécanismes physiopathologiques sont similaires à ceux décrits dans l'épilepsie au sens large, il existe cependant quelques mécanismes de toxicité plus spécifique dont la connaissance peut avoir une implication thérapeutique. De même, des facteurs extraneurologiques peuvent aggraver la situation. De nombreuses complications des crises convulsives peuvent être décrites, notamment cardiocirculatoires. Acute or chronic poisoning by drugs, illicit substances, environmental agents can cause seizures with a variable incidence. Seizures may be explained by the intrinsic properties of the drug or toxic agent. Among drugs, the incidence of tricyclic antidepressants induced seizures was particularly high. The increasing use of psychostimulants, like cocaine, is also responsible for frequent seizures. Drug induced seizures are usually brief, single, generalized tonic–clonic and self-limiting. They can even stop before any drug administration. However, they may evolve in some instances to status epilepticus. The mechanisms involved in drug induced seizures are rather similar to those observed in epileptic seizures. Yet, more specific mechanisms are also encountered and they will modify the therapeutic decisions. Also, extraneurological disorders could worsen the clinical condition. Several complications are described, including cardiocirculatory failure.",

      "abstract": "Introduction It is difficult to establish whether a patient has late onset schizophrenia or frontotemporal dementia. The object of the following case report is to point out the difficulty of making a differential diagnosis between these two entities. Case summary A 49-year-old female patient was admitted to our hospital after presenting with auditory and visual hallucinations, formal thought disorder, persecutory delusions, ideas of reference, insomnia. Memory, executive function and attentional tasks were severely compromised. Computerized tomography showed incipient frontal lobe atrophy. There were no significant abnormalities found in blood and urine samples or physical and neurological examinations. After showing no response to olanzapine, and extrapyramidal side effects to fluphenazine, risperidone was initiated which subsequently led to complete withdrawal of positive symptoms. Discussion Patients presenting with psychotic symptoms after the age of 40 presented a diagnostic quandary, as they were less likely to present with negative symptoms, formal thought disorder or affective blunting, and more likely to have systematised delusions and visual hallucinations. Frontotemporal dementia is a disorder that can present itself with cognitive decline and a large range of psychiatric symptoms. The risk of late onset schizophrenia is greater in women, possibly implicating a causative role of female sex hormones. Atypical antipsychotics risperidone and olanzapine seem to be an adequate treatment. Conclusion Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous disease with a large variety of clinical manifestations. Special care should be given to patients with age over 40, including neurocognitive assessment, laboratory and hormone tests, and a long-term follow-up.

Alongside with deficient disorders PMD are the main characteristics of post-traumatic disturbances of consciousness. PMD can be represented by different types of excitation, mistaken judgments (including paranoidal ones, confabulations, false orientation), false perception (psychosensory, in particular, illusory and hallucinatory phenomena) and affective disorders. Occurrence and signs of PMD were studied in 417 patients with brain injuries and their consequences. It was found that occurrence of PMD in clear consciousness (in form of delirium, confusion etc) is often a sign of deterioration of cerebral and/or somatic situation and requires urgent diagnostic and therapeutic measures. In another situation with PMD being revealed during emergence from coma, they are regarded as a prognostically favorable sign and require some correction only in case of long-term (more than 1-3 weeks) course. It was determined that PMD are characterized by: (a) a gradual (after emergence from unconsciousness) aggravation and complications of clinical symptoms till achieved orientation in the surroundings with their possible partial or complete regress; (b) the highest frequency and intensity with prevailed signs of dysfunction of any of cerebral hemispheres and the lowest frequency in case of relatively symmetric bilateral and profound brain damage; b) a great variety and severity in adult patients (compared with children and elderly). Irritation of different brain structures and their disconnection as well as pathological neuroplasticity in prolonged forms--are considered the basis for PMD occurrence.",

      "title": "DSM-5 substance use disorder: how conceptual missteps weakened the foundations of the addictive disorders field",
      "abstract": "DSM-5, following the recommendations of its substance-related disorders workgroup, radically reformulated the diagnostic criteria for substance use disorder (SUD). The changes have generated considerable controversy and concern, and are here reviewed and evaluated. DSM-IV included two substance use disorders, substance dependence and substance abuse. Dependence attempted directly to capture the concept of addiction as a psychiatric disorder, understood as impaired-control use. (The label addiction itself was narrowly rejected in earlier DSM revisions due to its purportedly pejorative nature.) Dependence diagnosis required any three or more of seven possible symptoms indicating impaired-control substance use, including two physiological dependence symptoms (tolerance, withdrawal) and five behavioural symptoms (giving up activities, continuing use despite harmful physical or psychological effects, trying to stop but cannot, taking larger amounts than intended, spending much time obtaining and taking the substance). Abuse diagnosis represented problematic use and required any one or more of four possible substance-related symptoms, including hazardous use (most commonly, driving while intoxicated), interpersonal problems (e.g., arguing with spouse), failure to fulfill role obligations at work, school, or home, and legal problems. 'Abuse' has long been a questionable disorder category. The 'dependence syndrome' model of addiction as impaired control over use 1, 2 is generally accepted as the most plausible conceptual justification for understanding addiction as a true psychiatric disorder rather than as moral weakness, social deviance, or rational choice. Since DSM-III-R, DSM diagnostic criteria for substance use disorders have been based on this model. Consistent with the model, the original intention was for 'dependence' to be the sole addiction disorder category 3. However, pragmatic concerns about having a diagnostic label for anyone needing help with substance use overrode validity concerns, and the abuse category was included in successive DSM editions until DSM-5. DSM's 'abuse' criteria clearly conflated social deviance with addictive pathology. ICD's parallel but narrower 'harmful use' category rejects face-invalid abuse criteria such as hazardous use and insists on substance-caused physical or mental health problems, thus at least ensuring medical need for intervention. Two rationales have been used to justify the DSM's 'abuse' category despite its face invalidity. First, the dependence syndrome model portrays addiction as a 'biaxial' concept with two components, an impaired-control motivational dysfunction and a harmful consequence component involving negative social, psychological, and physical consequences of excessive use 1. The model asserts that harmful consequences by themselves do not imply addiction (e.g., heavy recreational drinking without alcoholism can cause liver cirrhosis or automobile accidents). Nonetheless, the components are sometimes interpreted as distinct categories of psychiatric disorder: impaired-control use (dependence/addiction) and a residual category of harmful use without dependence (abuse). However, as both the DSM-5 definition of mental disorder and the 'harmful dysfunction' analysis of mental disorder 4, 5 make clear, harm without an underlying dysfunction is not a medical disorder. The biaxial conception, properly understood, requi-res both impaired control and consequent harm as components of every diagnosis of substance use disorder 6 and thus provides no support for an 'abuse' disorder category. Second, it is commonly claimed that abuse is mild or prodromal dependence, thus justifying its disorder status. This empirical claim has been amply disconfirmed. Substance abuse—however worthy of intervention—does not predict later dependence at substantial rates and does not correlate with validators in the same pattern as dependence 7. Abuse is also highly contextually anchored; for example, a large percentage of abuse diagnoses are due to driving under the influence of alcohol, which occurs at increased rates among those of higher socioeconomic status simply because they have automobiles 8, 9. To its credit, DSM-5 finally eliminated the substance abuse category. However, rather than acknowledging that the abuse category lacks conceptual validity as an addictive disorder and placing it in the Z Codes for non-disordered problems often treated by clinicians, DSM-5 took another route. Much of the abuse category was assimilated to dependence, in keeping with the empirically discredited 'mild or prodromal dependence' account of abuse. The workgroup relied heavily in its deliberations on factor analyses and item response theory analyses of abuse and dependence symptom items, most of which fail to discriminate abuse symptoms from dependence symptoms as distinct clusters or syndromes. However, researchers have long noted that the DSM dependence items are poorly worded to draw the dependence/abuse distinction among the highly correlated dependence and abuse items 10. Nonetheless, rather than taking the conceptual implausibility of the technical results as confirming the need for rewording and reevaluating the items and strengthening the validity of the dependence criteria, the workgroup interpreted the technical results as refuting the idea of there being abuse that is not a form of dependence: 'The \"abuse category\" has been eliminated from the proposed structure because of the lack of data to support an intermediate state between drug use and drug addiction' (11, p. 867). The implication was that abuse symptoms (including, e.g., hazardous use, despite all the contrary considerations) could be considered variants of dependence symptoms and could validly be retained as impaired-control measures. Conceptual grounding in the dependence syndrome model was thus abandoned in favor of obeisance to a literal reading of the technical results. The consequences for the decision process are vividly presented in the following description by a workgroup member of a scene that could be right out of one of Solomon Asch's social psychology experiments in which group pressure causes an individual to affirm things that are plainly false: 'I was one of the last holdouts against combining the abuse and dependence criteria because, to me, the dependence process and its consequences do seem conceptually distinct. However, as I looked around the table at my colleagues in our in-person meeting on this issue and considered the overwhelming abundance of evidence in favor of combining the abuse and dependence criteria, I found I no longer had grounds to hold to my position' (12, p. 703). In fact, the evidence for homogeneity of dependence and abuse was not 'overwhelming'. The failure of a technical method to clearly discriminate two things, or the demonstration that two things are intercorrelated in ways that allow them to fit a unidimensional mathematical model, is not a demonstration that two things do not exist. It is only a demonstration that the specific method of analysis using the specific selected measures does not discriminate them if they do exist—and in this case, we have strong independent clinical and personal evidence that the two entities, addiction and harmful use, do exist. Unidimensionality of item response analysis results can mean many things other than that there exists only one entity varying in severity 13, and no far-reaching conclusion can be drawn before alternative hypotheses are systematically tested, a task not undertaken by the workgroup. Moreover, there are many other sources of potential evidence that were not given weight. Observing that DSM-5′s decisions were based on a highly selective citing of evidence, Edwards concluded that the workgroup's reconceptualization 'goes against clinical experience, which suggests that people can develop destructive and disruptive drinking behavior without clinical symptoms of dependence' (14, p. 701), as for example in college students' harmful binge drinking independent of addiction. The workgroup's premature embrace of specific technical analyses to override compelling clinical and conceptual realities brings to mind Wittgenstein's famous admonition: 'In psychology there are experimental methods and conceptual confusion… The existence of the experimental method makes us think we have the means of solving the problems that trouble us; though problem and method pass one another by' (15, p. 232; emphasis in original). DSM-5 thus moved the abuse criteria, with all their validity problems, into an expanded category renamed 'substance use disorder' (SUD). Only the 'legal problems' criterion was abandoned because it was rarely used and plainly a matter of social deviance, not pathology. Additionally, a new 'craving' criterion was added both because craving is intuitively a phenomenological counterpart to impaired control and because it is an attractive target of pharmacological intervention. With 11 possible symptoms rather than 7, the idea was that SUD represents an enlarged and more valid impaired-control category with dimensional structure ranging from mild to severe cases; 2 or 3 symptoms is 'mild', 4 or 5 'moderate', and 6+ 'severe' SUD. Mechanically combining existing abuse and dependence criteria in SUD without reformulation exacerbated a problem of symptom criterion redundancy, weakening validity. Criteria overlap in meaning so that it is possible to satisfy multiple criteria and spuriously reach diagnostic threshold due to just one actual feature. For example, one can imagine satisfying the three symptoms of failure to fulfill role obligations, use despite social/interpersonal problems, and activities given up or reduced, all based on the same problem, lessened marital engagement due to time spent drinking with one's friends. Yet this one feature has low face validity for indicating impaired-use disorder. With so many more symptom options in SUD than in the former dependence category, it becomes much easier for an individual to meet three criteria. Thus, one might think that to maintain validity, the threshold number of symptoms needed for diagnosis would be raised to a higher number. This would be especially true because the added abuse symptoms appear to have less validity than the former dependence symptoms in identifying impaired-control dysfunction. Thus, the number of symptoms needed to have confidence that there is a dysfunction should be increased. The workgroup did the opposite; they lowered the number of symptoms required for diagnosis to 2. This is probably the most controversial substance-related change made by the DSM-5. If one considers SUD an expanded impaired-control addiction category analogous to dependence, then this change dramatically increases—indeed, more than doubles—the estimated prevalence of addiction. DSM-5′s SUD revision with its 2-symptom diagnostic threshold allows continued diagnosis of those with two abuse symptoms (e.g., drives under the influence and argues with spouse about it) and those with one abuse and one dependence symptom (e.g., has developed some tolerance to alcohol and drives under the influence). Moreover, diagnosis newly applies to those with two dependence symptoms (e.g., increased tolerance and drinks larger amounts than intended), dubbed by the literature as 'diagnostic orphans' as if they had been incorrectly abandoned rather than purposely placed below a plausible diagnostic threshold. However, studies show that these groups resemble former abuse cases more than dependence cases in prognosis. In terms of addiction as impaired control, the evidence is that probably they are mostly false positives, as validity evaluation of DSM-5 SUD suggests. DSM-5 has been heavily criticized for the lowered SUD diagnostic threshold. Before looking at the rationales offered for this change, one might ask: 'What did this effort yield in terms of increases in diagnostic validity and clinical utility?' Clinical utility for now appears weakened, primarily because virtually all treatment studies have used dependence samples. Consequently, nothing is known about what works with the much larger and more heterogeneous SUD category. Predictive studies have generally shown quite different long-term outcomes for members of the DSM-IV dependence category and the added SUD cases. Nor do the 'mild' SUD cases correspond to the former abuse cases, so that no simple translation is possible. More importantly for long-term scientific purposes, recent analyses present a markedly disappointing picture regarding validity 6. Looking at alcohol use disorder (AUD), which is by far the largest SUD category, DSM-5 AUD provides no gain at all in predictive validity or correlation with crucial validators relative to DSM-IV combined alcohol dependence and abuse. For example, DSM-5 AUD is not significantly different from DSM-IV combined dependence and abuse in levels of standard lifetime validators including episode duration, number of episodes, frequent heavy drinking, number of symptoms, suicidal ideation, service use, and family history. One-year validator results are similarly without validity gains. Alternatively, if one construes SUD as an expanded impaired-control category and compares DSM-5 AUD to DSM-IV alcohol dependence, then DSM-5 AUD represents a major loss of validity 6. DSM-5 AUD is significantly lower than DSM-IV alcohol dependence on every one of the above-mentioned validators except episode duration. Depending on the baseline of comparison, DSM-5 AUD shows no validity gain or substantially decreased validity relative to DSM-IV. Concerns that the threshold of two or more criteria is too low…(e.g., that it produces an overly heterogeneous group or that those at low severity levels are not 'true' cases)…were weighed against the competing need to identify all cases meriting intervention, including milder cases, for example, those presenting in primary care. Construed one way, this argument is a textbook example of begging the question. Mild cases of a disorder are still true cases, and no one is objecting to identifying mild cases of addiction. The objection is that the added cases—which are indeed symptomatically mild—are not mild cases of addictive disorder but rather not true cases of addictive disorder at all. Just as sneezing due to dust in the air is not a mild case of a cold, developing some tolerance to alcohol over time from social and mealtime drinking and driving home from social occasions after drinking is not generally mild addictive disorder. The workgroup's reply that we need to identify all cases including the mild ones begs the question of validity. However, the explanation was probably intended as asserting a pragmatic point, that although the added cases may not be true cases of impaired control, for practical reasons we must be able to diagnose them as disorders to help them. The problem with this pragmatic argument is that it abandons validity as the criterion for category formulation, thereby undermining the integrity of research needed for developing more effective methods for helping those with true addictions. When there was a separate category of abuse, the pragmatic argument was more compelling because the invalidity was segregated in its own category and scientific study could focus on dependence. The present approach leaves the field with no reasonably valid target category for scientific study. The reality is that no one set of criteria is capable of both identifying the addicted and identifying all who could use help for substance use. Identifying the latter group while talking as if one is identifying the former group creates a state of confusion worse than before and presents an obstacle to scientific progress. [T]he substance use disorders criteria represent a dimensional condition with no natural threshold….To avoid a marked perturbation in prevalence without justification, the work group sought a threshold for DSM-5 substance use disorders that would yield the best agreement with the prevalence of DSM-IV substance abuse and dependence disorders combined. This argument offers an example of the classic 'sorites' or 'balding man' fallacy—the fallacy of inferring from the fact there is no sharp boundary between a concept and its opposite that therefore the distinction can be drawn anywhere one likes. The fact that the division between addiction and non-addiction is fuzzy does not imply that the threshold is entirely arbitrary and can be placed to accomplish such extraneous goals as preserving prevalence rates generated by other criteria that have been acknowledged to be invalid. A fuzzy concept can still have many reasonably clear cases, and the boundary should be drawn with an eye to avoiding the classification of conceptually relatively clear cases on the incorrect side of the distinction. Day shades into night, and childhood into adulthood, and the boundaries are fuzzy, but day/night and child/adult still have clear cases that make these vague distinctions extremely useful, and despite the vagueness, there are ways of drawing the distinctions that would be manifestly incorrect. If one can arbitrarily draw a concept's boundary anywhere one wishes, one has in effect discarded the distinction. That, I suggest, is in effect what DSM-5 did with the concept of 'addiction' when it arbitrarily placed the SUD threshold at 2 of 11 symptoms to achieve the goal of preserving earlier prevalence rates, without careful attention to the face conceptual validity of the cases that would fall on either side of the new threshold. Another argument in defense of the 2-symptom threshold concerns dimensionalization in service of prevention. The lower SUD threshold can be seen as part of DSM-5′s move toward dimensional criteria that allow for diagnosis of prodromal and mild conditions to promote prevention. The question is whether the lower end of the severity dimension represents disorders at all, or whether the risk of disorder is sufficiently high to warrant the massive numbers of additional diagnoses. Challenged to justify the fact that the new criteria will pathologize mild conditions, the workgroup Chair, Charles O'Brien, explained as follows: 'We can treat them earlier. And we can stop them from getting to the point where they're going to need really expensive stuff like liver transplants' (17, p. A11). However, this justification is based on an assumption that study after study has shown to be false, namely, that DSM-IV cases of abuse and dependence orphanhood that are newly classified as SUD are an early stage of dependence and have severe outcomes over time. To take O'Brien's example seriously, the established alcohol consumption risk factor for liver cirrhosis requires heavy drinking for decades, which is unlikely to occur at the milder end of the SUD spectrum. There are about 27 000 yearly U.S. cirrhosis deaths (from all causes, not just alcohol), <0.01% of the population, whereas DSM-5 extends the SUD 'impaired control' label to approximately an additional 7% of the entire population each year (about 21 000 000 people) over and above the 5% or so identified by DSM-IV dependence 6. There is no evidence that the cirrhosis cases come out of the added group in significant numbers, nor that such massive diagnostic overreach is a feasible let alone cost-effective way of addressing the prevention of cirrhosis or identifying those at risk. Putting substance-related symptoms together and calling the result a 'severity dimension' of SUD does not make SUD a construct-valid disorder. Non-disordered conditions can be severe (e.g., pain in childbirth, normal grief, binge drinking upon arrival at college). Moreover, the diagnostic threshold should be the point at which the diagnostician is justified in attributing a disorder (e.g., impaired control) rather than a non-disorder 18. In SUD's polythetic diagnostic criteria set, every symptom is given equal weight in meeting diagnostic threshold requirements, so adding weaker indicators of dysfunction from the former abuse criteria allows ample false positives to arise when the diagnostic threshold is reached by combinations of weak symptoms. The workgroup denied the accusation that the new criteria would add to disorder diagnoses: 'a concern that \"millions more\" would be diagnosed with the DSM-5 threshold is unfounded' (16, p. 841). This answer (which contradicts the 'prevention' argument that presupposes increased diagnosis) disingenuously construes the baseline as DSM-IV combined dependence and abuse, which, by design, DSM-5 SUD matches in prevalence. The critics of course have in mind a comparison to DSM-IV dependence, which was generally considered the 'real' impaired-control category. As noted, many millions more are indeed diagnosed by DSM-5 SUD. The name change from 'dependence' to 'substance use disorder' was justified by the claim that the label 'dependence' confused addiction with 'physiological dependence' consisting of tolerance and withdrawal symptoms. The workgroup argued, correctly, that physiological dependence is an expectable consequence of the body's adaptation to some medications, including opioid pain medication, and not sufficient by itself to imply addiction (i.e., impaired-control use) 19. This understanding was already reflected in DSM-IV's text and its three-symptom dependence threshold which required at least one additional behavioural symptom of impaired control even when tolerance and withdrawal were present. Nonetheless, the workgroup argued that the verbal confusion of 'dependence' with 'physiological dependence' was a problem in pain medicine, where doctors and patients may resist adequate opioid medication for fear of inducing physiological dependence that is misconstrued as addiction. The potential for confusion certainly exists. However, there is no solid evidence that physicians' or patients' reluctance about opioid medication for non-cancer pain was generally based on this verbal confusion. Nevertheless, the urgent, overriding importance of this terminological change to facilitate prescription of opioid medication was emphasized by the workgroup's Chair: 'Of all the changes proposed by the DSM-5 work group, this one consistently is greeted by standing ovations when presented to audiences of physicians with the responsibility for the treatment of pain' (20, p. 705). This emphasis in the DSM-5 revision process represented a major historic misstep. At the time the workgroup was making these arguments, a massive problem of abuse of opioid medication for non-cancer chronic pain was emerging in the United States, with resultant heroin addiction and a startling number of overdose deaths, as well as associated social dislocations reaching into communities where it had rarely been seen before. Earlier arguments that it was safe to extend opioid use to non-cancer pain were clearly overstated ovations by pain physicians notwithstanding. Perhaps some physician and patient caution about prescription opioid painkillers was not such a bad thing after all. The DSM-5 workgroup was blind to this growing problem that, as they deliberated, was reaching epidemic proportions. If the opioid misstep had stopped at a purely terminological change, it would have been minimally impactful on research and clinical diagnosis, but it did not. Recall that DSM-5 lowered the SUD diagnostic threshold from DSM-IV's 3 of 7 symptoms to any 2 of 11 symptoms, including tolerance and withdrawal. Thus, the DSM-5 workgroup actually created the very problem that supposedly they were trying to address; they made it possible to diagnose SUD (i.e., addiction) based on the two physiological dependence symptoms alone, thus potentially confusing physiological adaptation with impaired-control use. This self-created problem conflicted with the goal of facilitating prescription of opioids for pain. An important exception to making a diagnosis of DSM-5 substance use disorder with two criteria pertains to the supervised use of psychoactive substances for medical purposes, including stimulants, cocaine, opioids, nitrous oxide, sedative-hypnotic/anxiolytic drugs, and cannabis in some jurisdictions. These substances can produce tolerance and withdrawal as normal physiological adaptations when used appropriately for supervised medical purposes. Under these conditions, tolerance and withdrawal in the absence of other criteria do not indicate substance use disorders and should not be diagnosed as such. Note that the labeling of withdrawal symptoms during prescribed use of opioids and other medications as 'normal' in order to argue that withdrawal symptoms during prescribed use should not be used as an indicator of SUD involves a potentially misleading equivocation on the meaning of 'normal'. Having withdrawal symptoms when cutting down on opioids is not a normal human condition in the sense of 'non-disordered' and is recognized as a separate category of DSM disorder. Moreover, withdrawal disorder often leads to impaired-control use and so has traditionally been a central indicator of addiction. Withdrawal is 'normal' only in the weak sense of being an expectable reaction as the body adjusts to the presence of the substance. However, many disorders are expectable under certain conditions, such as a broken bone when a certain level of pressure is applied to a limb. Prescribed use may expectably induce the complication of withdrawal disorder, and by itself, this does not imply addiction, but calling it 'normal' and eliminating it from SUD criteria suggest that physicians should not be concerned about it in the context of assessing addiction in patients, and this is far from the case. Equivocation aside, the ad hoc approach of excluding the tolerance and withdrawal symptom criteria only when evaluating SUD in medically supervised substance use has two fatal problems. First, it is conceptually incoherent. If, as the workgroup argued, tolerance and withdrawal are not a use disorder when the drug is prescribed, then they are not a use disorder when the same drug is not prescribed, for the very same reason provided by the workgroup—namely, they do not by themselves imply impaired-control use. Moreover, the workgroup's approach yields the absurdity that changes in laws can cause and 'cure' disorders. For example, the criteria allow the absurdity that if a medical marijuana user having only tolerance and withdrawal symptoms moves from a state where cannabis use is legal and medically supervised to a state where its use is illegal, and continues precisely the same pattern of medical use with the same symptoms, the individual has gone from being non-disordered to being disordered. Even the results of research will differ by locale due to differences in the legal status of various substances. Second, this approach violates the DSM-5′s (and harmful dysfunction analysis') definition of mental disorder, which states that the existence of disorder cannot be merely a matter of deviance or conflict with society. Yet, the only difference between the disordered and the non-disordered under DSM-5′s SUD criteria may be that one is taking the substance in accordance with legal rules while the other is not. This approach makes DSM-5 diagnosis overtly an instrument of social control unrelated to disorder status, the very outcome that the definition of mental disorder was designed to avoid. The most troubling implication of these conceptually misguided features of DSM-5 SUD diagnosis is that, with an opioid abuse epidemic upon us, diagnosing an individual who may be developing an opioid SUD while taking prescribed pain medication is now more difficult than before. Such an individual who is experiencing marked tolerance and withdrawal symptoms (which are excluded from consideration) must display two additional behavioural symptoms to be diagnosed, rather than just the one required by DSM-IV. The timing for such ill-conceived changes could not be worse. An additional issue is that there is a degree of arbitrariness to the workgroup's focus on physiological dependence as a potential source of false-positive addiction diagnoses among individuals taking prescribed medication. It has long been observed that taking prescribed opioids can lead to false-positive versions of many of the behavioural SUD symptoms as well. For example, a rural individual attempting to escape chronic pain may well spend much time and give up other activities to maintain an opioid prescription if the only available pharmacy is in a distant town. It is also clear that craving when confronted with triggers can exist even without impaired-control use—and the workgroup recognized this by allowing craving to persist consistent with an individual being in remission. Again, the workgroup might have spent more effort systematically refining the symptom items to achieve greater conceptual validity. To conclude, I have argued that the concerns about DSM-5 SUD diagnostic criteria are quite justified, and the arguments put forward by the DSM-5 workgroup to address critics' concerns generally spurious. Despite some welcome improvements including the elimination of the abuse category and the clarification of terminology, DSM-5′s substantial changes to SUD diagnosis fail to strengthen validity or clinical utility and diverge markedly from projected ICD-11 criteria. In adding highly face-invalid criteria such as hazardous use and social conflicts to a category that is supposed to represent a motivational dysfunction of impaired control, and then lowering the diagnostic threshold to a level that allows weaker-validity criteria by themselves to qualify for diagnosis, DSM-5 has cast into doubt the hard-fought and still controversial validity of SUD as a category of psychiatric disorder. The changes weaken and even abandon the conceptual foundations of the substance disorders field as part of psychiatry. My analysis presupposes that there is such a thing as impaired control of use that warrants psychiatric diagnosis. This assumption is currently under challenge from a variety of quarters. If this assumption is false, then by all means we should move on to a different conceptualization of the kinds of compulsive harmful substance use that we now conceptualize as addiction. The problem is that the DSM-5 workgroup verbally retained the impaired-control framework while reformulating diagnostic criteria in ways inconsistent with that framework. This undermines the ability to pursue good science addressing the validity of the concept of addiction and of the impaired-control model. If ICD-11 resists the temptation to move toward some of DSM-5′s innovations, it will provide a much-needed alternative approach to addictive disorder diagnosis that could become the field's preferred standard for advancing addiction science.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia impairs daytime functioning or causes clinically significant daytime distress. The consequences of insomnia, if left untreated, may contribute to the risks of developing additional serious conditions, such as psychiatric illness, cardiovascular disease, or metabolic issues. Furthermore, some comorbidities associated with insomnia may be bidirectional in their causality because psychiatric and other medical problems can increase the risk for insomnia. Regardless of the serious consequences of inadequately treated insomnia, clinicians often do not inquire into their patients' sleep habits, and patients, in turn, are not forthcoming with details of their sleep difficulties. The continuing education of physicians and patients with regard to insomnia and currently available therapies for the treatment of insomnia is, therefore, essential. Insomnia may present as either a difficulty falling asleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, or waking too early without being able to return to sleep. Furthermore, these symptoms often change over time in an unpredictable manner. Therefore, when considering a sleep medication, one with efficacy for the treatment of multiple insomnia symptoms is recommended. A modified-release formulation of zolpidem, zolpidem extended-release, has been approved for the treatment of insomnia characterized by both difficulty in falling asleep and maintaining sleep. Here, we review studies supporting the use of zolpidem extended-release in the treatment of sleep-onset and sleep maintenance difficulties.",

The transition from voluntary to compulsive drug use reflects changes in the brain’s natural inhibition and reward centers that keep a person from exerting control over the impulse to use drugs even when there are negative consequences—the defining characteristic of addiction. Many adolescent risk factors, including genetic vulnerability, prenatal exposure to alcohol or other drugs, lack of parental supervision or monitoring, a history of physical and/or sexual abuse, and an association with drug-using peers are risk factors that contribute to a greater likelihood of being diagnosed with a substance use disorder. On average, adolescents tend to show a reduction in use following treatment, but post-treatment course is variable. Aftercare helps to maintain treatment gains, and more than one episode of treatment may be needed for some adolescents with more severe substance involvement.",

      "title": "Neurotransmission in Mood Disorders",
      "abstract": "Mood disorders are characterized by depression, mania, or both. There are two groups of mood disorders, depressive disorders and bipolar disorder. Bipolar disorder is characterized by intermittent episodes of mania or hypomania and depressive episodes; rapid cycling, mixed states, and psychotic symptoms occur in some cases. Depression is a serious mental disorder that manifests with depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure, feelings of guilt or low self-worth, disturbed sleep or appetite, low energy, and poor concentration. Mania is the opposite of depression; it is a state of abnormally elevated or irritable mood, arousal, and/or energy levels. Depression and mania are thought to be heterogeneous illnesses that can result from dysfunction of several neurotransmitter or metabolic systems.",

      "title": "Treatment and Therapeutic Interventions: The Use of Medication",
      "abstract": "Medication may be used to treat two broad types of mental health problem: psychiatric disorders (such as depression, schizophrenia or obsessive‐compulsive disorder) and challenging behaviours (such as self‐injury, impulsive aggression or inappropriate sexual behaviour). The effectiveness of medication in the treatment of psychiatric disorder is well established for the non‐learning‐disabled population. In clinical practice, medication seems to be broadly as effective for people with learning disabilities. The effectiveness of medication in the treatment of challenging behaviours is less well established, although evidence for effectiveness is accumulating for some types of problem behaviour. When treating behavioural problems, medication is often used in combination with other management strategies. Knowledge of side effects is important, because people who have difficulty communicating may not be able to Report problems before they become severe. When using medication, it is important to try to achieve the best benefit: risk ratio, taking into account the person's other health problems and disabilities. It may be necessary to measure treatment effects, using standardised assessments or individual measures of target symptoms or behaviours.",

      "title": "States of consciousness: new insights and further questions",
      "abstract": "In the immediate aftermath of a severe brain injury survivors are usually in coma, which is characterised as a state of unresponsiveness without any understanding or purposeful functions, although reflex responses can still be elicited. If the injury is severe enough but not fatal, the coma can persist for days or weeks, but it is nonetheless recognised to be a transient condition which evolves into other defined conscious states. Consciousness may be regained, but if not signs of a persistent vegetative state (also called unresponsive wakefulness syndrome) or a minimally conscious state develop. Both the latter are characterised by spontaneous or induced eye opening and sleep wake cycles, with additional responses such as apparent crying, laughing, or smiling. In the minimally conscious state there are also reproducible if inconsistent visual, verbal, or gestural responses to particular stimuli. In both these states, signs depend on relatively intact brain stem function, contrasting with the locked-in syndrome, a condition in which brain stem dysfunction prevents a conscious person from demonstrating their awareness.1, 2 Recognition of the two states of reduced consciousness has informed treatment and management decisions. Families and others who can see obvious signs of improvement, in that a person is no longer completely unresponsive or comatose, often expect further recovery. Standard advice is that in adults and children the potential for recovery from the persistent vegetative state, and the time to allow, depends on the cause: significant improvement can still occur up to 12 months after traumatic injury, but only up to 3 months after a non-traumatic injury, such as near-drowning. The potential for recovery from a minimally responsive state may be better, but it is not clear by how much, or if the time scales differ. One group reported that in the first 3 months there is a good chance of reasonable recovery but this falls sharply with longer durations, especially after non-traumatic injuries. In the latter groups survivors may continue to improve in terms of responsiveness but most remain severely disabled.1, 3, 4 However, problems remain. Detailed definitions of the clinical features of the two states differ.3 Distinguishing the two states is clinically difficult, although specific scales increase diagnostic precision.2 It seems logical to expect that in some patients with additional brain stem damage a state of reduced consciousness might co-exist with a degree of locked-in syndrome. In addition, from personal experience some patients do not show spontaneous eye opening or sleep-wake cycles despite other responses suggestive of a minimally conscious state. Such cases are not defined or studied in the medical literature. Finally over the last few years functional neuroimaging studies, mostly in adults, have shown that some patients have much more cortical responsiveness than clinically suspected, meaning that some thought to be in a persistent vegetative state may be at least minimally conscious.5 In one study 13 out of 41 patients classified by a standard scale as being in the vegetative state showed activity compatible with a minimally conscious state on neuroimaging between 3 weeks and 8 years after the injury. Twelve months later some clinical improvement in consciousness had occurred in most, usually to a minimally conscious state. One, assessed approximately 5 weeks after a traumatic injury, had recovered fully but the other survivors were still severely disabled.5 Ideally perhaps patients should now all be assessed by functional neuroimaging, but that may be impractical. The predictive value of more accessible modalities such as EEG and transcranial magnetic stimulation are still being explored. For all these, it would be clinically helpful if outcome studies followed a standard format to report the state and how it was assessed at fixed times after the injury, such as 3 months and 6 months, and the prognosis at 12 months or thereafter, subdivided into traumatic and non-traumatic groups. In the meantime all patients in such states should be assumed to have some awareness some of the time, which means for example that there must be adequate analgesia for painful conditions or procedures, and that further discussion is needed on the relationship between responsiveness and awareness. In children these difficulties are even more marked. There is limited data on both the accuracy of clinical diagnosis and outcome, especially in the very young age groups.1 Clinical scales have not been validated in children. Some studies of functional imaging have included children or young people but do not always report their data separately. Patient and medical groups should lobby for standardized outcome studies in children, which should be large enough to provide useful data for smaller subgroups.",

      "abstract": "Serotonin syndrome (SS) is a potentially life-threatening condition associated with increased serotonergic activity in the central nervous system. SS is characterized by a triad of altered mental status, autonomic dysfunction, and neuromuscular abnormalities [Boyer and Shannon, 2005]. The syndrome is, for some authors, a loose term to define the clinical picture at the moderate to severe end of a spectrum of serotonin toxicity, mild symptoms of which include tremor, hyperreflexia, and occasional myoclonus [Gillman and Whyte, 2004]. In the severe forms of toxicity, generalized myoclonus, sustained ankle clonus, and hyperreflexia may occur along with hyperthermia, which is associated with increased mortality [Gillman, 2013]. SS is classically associated with the high doses of a single selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) use, or with a combination of two or more serotonergic agents [Mason et al. 2000].\r\n\r\nFluoxetine is metabolized in the liver by the isoenzymes of the cytochrome P450 system, including CYP2D6 [Blazquez et al. 2012]. The role of CYP2D6 in the metabolism of fluoxetine may be clinically important, as there is a great genetic variability in the function of this enzyme [Gaedigk, 2013].\r\n\r\nAripiprazole, an atypical antipsychotic, which is a partial agonist at the 5-HT1A receptors, is equally metabolized via both CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 isoenzymes [Molden et al. 2006]. Therefore, coadministration with fluoxetine (a potent inhibitor of CYP450 2D6) may significantly increase the plasma concentrations of aripiprazole. On the other hand, aripiprazole has no known effect on fluoxetine metabolism [Boulton et al. 2010].\r\n\r\nHere, we describe a case in which increased plasma concentration of aripiprazole due to a drug interaction with fluoxetine led to SS.",

El estado mental podria ser dificil de valorar durante la agitacion extrema, en cuyo caso el aislamiento y la obtencion de informacion de fuentes apropiadas pordria ser crucial para iniciar un tratamiento racional y adecuado. Para prevenir danos al paciente y a otras personas, la intervencion farmacologica debe ser inmediata, concordante y autoevaluatoria.

Si el grado de agitacion es superior a los treinta puntos en la escala de agitacion, no se recomienda mantener al paciente sin el beneficio del tratamiento farmacologico. De ser posible, debe evitarse la sedacion. La combinacion de haloperidol-lorazepam es la mejor porque no tiene efectos extrapiramidales y requiere 50% menos de haloperidol. Si no se logra la sedacion en menos de seis horas, despues de una dosis total de 60 mgs de haloperidol y 8 mgs de lorazepam, administrados por via intramuscular, entonces se recomienda aplicar la combinacion por via endovenosa.",

      "abstract": "Objectives: The dystonias belong to a group of patologies included on movement disorders. They can be classified in some ways, of which we highlight those in terms of its localization or etiology. Psychogenic dystonia is an exclusion diagnosis, which is infradiagnosed due to the difficulty to specify the disorder. We proposed a review over its use in usual clinical practice, in relation to the symptoms, difficulties of diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. Development: The inconsistency of symptoms and incongruity with the classical symptomatology, and so the poor therapeutic answer to usual treatments set out to the diagnosis. Its psychiatric comorbility with anxiety, depression, somatizations, conversion symptomatology or personality traits would support the diagnosis; but its presence is not strictly necessary. Psychiatric characteristics are sometimes seen trough the basis of movement disorder of neurological origin. Symptoms of depression or anxiety are related with a better prognosis, while cronification, insidious onset, the diagnosis of hypocondria, the factitious disorder or the simulation are related with poor prognosis. It's recommended a combined pharmacologic-psycotherapic treatment. Recent studies with antidepressants have shown encouraging results. Conclusions: It's very important to make a correct differential diagnosis that allows to approach to the disorder to avoid iatrogenia o unnecessary invasive tests.",

      "title": "Society of Anesthesia and Sleep Medicine Position Paper on Patient Sleep During Hospitalization",
      "abstract": "This article addresses the issue of patient sleep during hospitalization, which the Society of Anesthesia and Sleep Medicine believes merits wider consideration by health authorities than it has received to date. Adequate sleep is fundamental to health and well-being, and insufficiencies in its duration, quality, or timing have adverse effects that are acutely evident. These include cardiovascular dysfunction, impaired ventilatory function, cognitive impairment, increased pain perception, psychomotor disturbance (including increased fall risk), psychological disturbance (including anxiety and depression), metabolic dysfunction (including increased insulin resistance and catabolic propensity), and immune dysfunction and proinflammatory effects (increasing infection risk and pain generation). All these changes negatively impact health status and are counterproductive to recovery from illness and operation. Hospitalization challenges sleep in a variety of ways. These challenges include environmental factors such as noise, bright light, and overnight awakenings for observations, interventions, and transfers; physiological factors such as pain, dyspnea, bowel or urinary dysfunction, or discomfort from therapeutic devices; psychological factors such as stress and anxiety; care-related factors including medications or medication withdrawal; and preexisting sleep disorders that may not be recognized or adequately managed. Many of these challenges appear readily addressable. The key to doing so is to give sleep greater priority, with attention directed at ensuring that patients' sleep needs are recognized and met, both within the hospital and beyond. Requirements include staff education, creation of protocols to enhance the prospect of sleep needs being addressed, and improvement in hospital design to mitigate environmental disturbances. Hospitals and health care providers have a duty to provide, to the greatest extent possible, appropriate preconditions for healing. Accumulating evidence suggests that these preconditions include adequate patient sleep duration and quality. The Society of Anesthesia and Sleep Medicine calls for systematic changes in the approach of hospital leadership and staff to this issue. Measures required include incorporation of optimization of patient sleep into the objectives of perioperative and general patient care guidelines. These steps should be complemented by further research into the impact of hospitalization on sleep, the effects of poor sleep on health outcomes after hospitalization, and assessment of interventions to improve it.",

      "abstract": "The management of choreic disorders presents significant challenges, including identifying the etiology of the disorder, treating and preventing motor symptoms, and managing a range of other neurologic and behavioral complications. Chorea may occur in several neurodegenerative, genetic, or drug-related conditions, and a thorough diagnostic evaluation is needed to identify the specific underlying causes. Some choreic disorders have specific treatable underlying etiologies, such as vitamin B(12) deficiency or drug-induced dyskinesia. Autoimmune disorders such as Sydenham chorea may be treated with penicillin, corticosteroids, intravenous immunoglobulin, or plasma exchange. Heredodegenerative choreas such as Huntington disease often respond to treatment with tetrabenazine or amantadine. Many other agents may be used nonspecifically for symptom control, including benzodiazepines, neuroleptics, and antiepileptic medications. In addition to motor symptoms, patients with Huntington disease or other choreic disorders often experience increasing depression, bradykinesia, cognitive impairment, aggressive behaviors, and other complications as the disease progresses. Caring for the caregiver is also a significant concern in the long-term treatment of choreic disorders.",

No head pain followed. The roles of caffeine, hypoglycemia, and exercise, alone and in combination, require investigation in the evaluation of other cases of exercise‐induced migraine.

      "abstract": "Unexplained physical signs and symptoms represent a significant portion of patient presentations in acute care settings. Even in cases where a patient presents with a known medical condition, functional or somatic symptoms may complicate the diagnostic and treatment processes and prognostic outcome. One umbrella category for neurologically related somatic symptoms, functional neurological disorder (FND), presents as involuntary neurological symptoms incompatible with another medical condition. Symptoms may include weakness and/or paralysis, movement disorders, non-epileptic seizures, speech or visual impairment, swallowing difficulty, sensory disturbances, or cognitive symptoms (1). While FND presents as neuropsychiatric, providers commonly report feeling hesitant to diagnose these disorders. Inexperience or lack of appropriate education on relevant research regarding evidence-based practices or standard of practice (SOP) may result in over- or underperforming diagnostic workups and consultations, utilizing inappropriate medications, and failing to offer evidence-based psychological interventions. Being mindful of these challenges when treating patients presenting with functional symptoms in acute care settings can help to support and protect the patients and care team and appropriately control healthcare costs.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Many medical disorders can give rise to disturbances of sleep and alter sleep architecture. Sleep can be impaired by the medical conditions themselves or by the medications used to treat them. Several symptoms associated with medical disorders, such as pain, dyspnea, nocturia, and pruritus can potentially disturb sleep, with the severity of sleep complaints waxing and waning in relation to the course of the medical illness. More than one sleep pathology may be present in a particular patient. The sleep disturbance causes distress and functional impairment, and requires independent clinical management. Conversely, sleep impairment can alter the presentation and adversely affect the symptoms of a variety of medical conditions, including respiratory, cardiac, gastrointestinal, renal, rheumatologic and infectious disorders. Asthma is a disease characterized by episodic dyspnea and wheezing, reversible episodes of bronchoconstriction, and airway hyperreactivity to a variety of specific and nonspecific stimuli. Sleep disturbance in patients with asthma can result in complaints of insomnia (including early morning awakenings) or excessive sleepiness. In one study, three of every four asthmatics reported nocturnal awakenings occurring at least once weekly, whereas two-thirds had nocturnal awakenings at least three times a week. Sleep in patients with nocturnal asthma is characterized by poor sleep quality with frequent arousals. They may awaken repeatedly due to coughing, dyspnea, wheezing, and chest discomfort. Complaints of insomnia and/or excessive daytime sleepiness are not infrequent.",

These abnormal events or experiences are not principally abnormalities of the states of sleep and wakefulness, and they are not generally associated with major complaints of excessive sleepiness or insomnia. Parasomnias can manifest as activation of skeletal muscles or the autonomic nervous system during sleep. They usually occur intermittently or episodically either within sleep or during its transition to and from wakefulness.

Parasomnias can be classified into three groups based on the American Academy of Sleep Medicine International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD; second edition; see References) (Box 7–1). 1.

These symptoms can include physical (e.g., pain, shortness of breath), cognitive (e.g., delirium, memory problems, impaired concentration), and affective (e.g., depression, anxiety) experiences associated with the disease and its treatments (1). Symptoms are the side effects and ''toxicities'' of treatment, as well as the direct product of the disease process itself. Symptoms are what patients report to clinicians as the subjective negative feelings of physical and mental changes produced by both disease and treatment. Symptom severity is related to the extent of disease and the aggressiveness of therapy. Common symptoms of cancer and cancer treatment significantly impair the daily function and quality of life of patients. Symptoms that are unrecognized by treatment teams may also become so severe that emergency room visits or hospitalization are required for management, adding substantially to the cost of treatment and to the disruption of the patients' routines and those of their families. Untreated symptoms may also negatively influence treatment effectiveness by interrupting treatment (2). Multiple and severe symptoms present a significant challenge to the resources of those who care for and managecancer patients. For example, intensive cancer therapies produce severe and sometimes life-threatening side effects, resulting in patients' inability to care for themselves and in total dependence on caregivers (3).

In der Lebenszeit wie auch aktuell sind bis weit über 50% der Opiatabhängigen von komorbiden psychischen Störungen betroffen. Besonders verbreitet sind affektive und Angststörungen, Persönlichkeitsstörungen sowie posttraumatische Belastungsstörungen. Diese Störungen können allenfalls zu einem Teil als Begleit- oder Folgeerscheinung der Opiatabhängigkeit erklärt werden. Vorbestehende psychische Belastungen und frühzeitig manifestierte Störungen können vielmehr oft als wesentliche Faktoren bei der Suchtentstehung angesehen werden, z. B. im Sinne einer Selbstmedikation mit psychotropen Substanzen. Pharmakologische und psychotherapeutische Behandlungsmöglichkeiten der komorbiden psychischen Störungen sind hinsichtlich ihrer Anwendbarkeit und Wirksamkeit bei unbehandelten oder in Behandlung (z. B. Substitution) befindlichen Opiatabhängigen kaum erforscht. Zudem fehlt es an integrierten Modellen und Algorithmen für die Behandlung bei gleichzeitig bestehenden substanzbezogenen und sonstigen psychischen Störungen.",

      "title": "Pathophysiology and Organ Damage in Anaphylaxis",
      "abstract": "Anaphylaxis is an acute, potentially life-threatening multisystem syndrome resulting from the sudden release of mast cell- and basophil-derived mediators into the systemic circulation. Foods, medications, and insect stings cause most anaphylaxis for which a cause can be identified, but virtually any agent capable of directly or indirectly activating mast cells or basophils can cause it. This syndrome can consist of some or all the following signs and symptoms: diffuse pruritus, erythema, urticaria, and/or angioedema; bronchospasm; laryngeal edema; hypotension; and/or cardiac arrhythmias. Some of the other symptoms that can occur include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, lightheadedness, headache, feeling of impending doom, and unconsciousness. Regardless of the presenting signs or symptoms, which usually present within 5–30 min following the administration of the offending agent, this reaction can progress to respiratory compromise and cardiovascular collapse resulting in human fatalities. Usually, the more rapid the onset of clinical manifestations, the more likely the anaphylaxis will be life threatening. Immediate and appropriate therapy, especially with epinephrine, is mandatory to reverse the reactions. While most reactions are uniphasic, some can be biphasic or protracted. This chapter discusses the immunopathologic mechanisms and effects of anaphylaxis.",

Fourteen had clouded states, which were found to be transitory obscurings of consciousness of varying depths, developing some years after seizures first began, usually occurring after several successive convulsions, characterized nearly always by overactivity, by variable speech abnormalities, wide variations of mood, visual and auditory hallucinations, delusions, disorientation, poor recent memory, defective judgment, and little or no insight. In some cases, the content of the psychosis could be partly traced to earlier factors in the patient's lives. The clouded states were compared to alcoholic pathological intoxication. Three had chronic psychoses resembling schizophrenia. One other was considerably deteriorated. The rest were unclassified. The neuropathological processes underlying these conditions are unknown. The clouded states contribute to the study of psychopathology. Psychotherapy might be of some value. There is great need of research in this almost untouched field.",

      "abstract": "Until recently alcoholism was regarded as being an incurable psychological problem. During the last decade a chain of research has led to a new insight into the causes and potential alleviation of alcohol craving: Recent discoveries indicate that the brain has receptor sites for naturally occurring opiate-like substances (endorphins and enkephalins) which are produced by the nervous system. Opiates such as morphine or heroin, and some of the metabolic products of alcohol (tetrahydroiso-quinolines), can also attach themselves to these receptors. It has been further discovered that the craving for alcohol is related to a deficiency of the naturally occurring opiate-like substances as well as other neurotransmitter substances. This deficiency can occur genetically or as a result of prolonged stress or long-term heavy drinking. The neurochemical imbalance may be treated chemically, leading to a possible alleviation of the craving for alcohol, especially in conjunction with psychotherapeutic and counseling regimens.",

These can be distinguished from adverse reactions to cannabis, the commonest of which is an acute anxiety state. Acute psychotic episodes can also follow ingestion of the drug but are infrequent. These can be classified as acute confusional states and episodes occurring in clear consciousness. Neither presentation consistently shows enough specific features to warrant the diagnosis of 'cannabis psychosis' as a distinct clinical entity. The evidence that cannabis has a causative role in chronic psychotic or affective disorders is not convincing, although the drug may modify the course of an already established illness. Further controlled studies would be required to clarify the aetiological significance of the drug in these conditions.",

      "abstract": "One of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia is changes in individual behavior which always assess themselves and others negatively, or undervalue their abilities which is called low self-esteem. Hallucinations are mental disorders in which the client experiences changes in sensory perception, feeling false sensations in the form of sound, sight, taste, touch or smell. The patient says that he often hears whispers like the voice of the devil mocking him, the client says he often feels anxious, daydreaming. During the assessment process, the nurse uses therapeutic communication and builds a trusting nurse-client relationship. In Mr.C's case, it was found that the client experienced hallucinatory symptoms such as hearing voices, anxiety, difficulty sleeping, looking tense, pacing, unable to maintain eye contact, sad, embarrassed, hopeless, withdrawn, irritable and etc. Nursing diagnoses that appeared in the Tn.C case: Auditory hallucinations, social isolation, ineffective individual coping, spiritual deficits, low self-esteem. But in practice, the authors focus on the problem of auditory hallucination sensory perception disorder. The purpose of writing is to provide nursing care to Tn.C. The writing method used is observation writing making observations by seeing, hearing and noting certain activities related to the client. The subject to be used is the case of one patient with sensory perception disorders: auditory hallucinations. The results of the analysis show that nursing interventions with implementation strategies (SP) can reduce signs and symptoms of auditory hallucination sensory perception disorders in patients after being given nursing actions.",

      "abstract": "In this review we present a pragmatic approach to the patient with chronic vestibular symptoms. Even in the chronic patient a retrospective diagnosis should be attempted, in order to establish how the patient reached the current situation. Simple questions are likely to establish if the chronic dizzy symptoms started as benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), vestibular neuritis, vestibular migraine, Meniere's disease or as a brainstem stroke. Then it is important to establish if the original symptoms are still present, in which case they need to be treated (e.g. repositioning maenouvres for BPPV, migraine prophylaxis) or if you are only dealing with chronic dizzy symptoms. In addition the doctor or physiotherapist needs to establish if the process of central vestibular compensation has been impeded due to additional clinical problems, e.g. visual problems (squints, cataract operation), proprioceptive deficit (neuropathy due to diabetes or alcohol), additional neurological or orthopaedic problems, lack of mobility or confidence, such as fear of falling or psychological disorders. A general neurological examination should also be conducted, amongst other reasons to make sure your patient's `chronic dizziness' is not due to a neurological gait disorder. Treatment of the syndrome of chronic dizziness is multidisciplinary but rehabilitation and simple counselling should be available to all patients. In contrast, vestibular suppressants or tranquilisers should be reduced or, if possible, stopped.",

      "title": "Impaired Mental Proprioception in Schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Psychiatrists recognize that schizophrenia is a disorder in which the highest mental functions, such as thought, language, emotions, conation, and cognition, are drastically disrupted. However, the most serious impairment in schizophrenia is a global malfunction in self-integration and personal identity that includes a deficit in self-recognition. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] This distorted sense of leads persons with schizophrenia to fail to recognize what is or is not part of their own mind, which can produce clinical symptoms of schizophrenia, including bizarre delusions, hallucinations, thought disorder, social deficits, and information processing. (1) Just as intact physical proprioception enables a healthy person to be continuously aware of where his body and its parts are located in space, allowing sensory-motor integration, mental proprioception enables one to be fully aware of his identity and self-boundaries, and that his thoughts and actions are generated from within his own sphere of consciousness, not from an external source. In schizophrenia, the coherent sense of is shattered and fragmented, a frightening experience patients describe after emerging from psychosis. (2) A person affected by schizophrenia feels lost, as if his no longer belong[s] to him. He feels alienated from his real self and refers to himself in the third person. He feels disconnected, disintegrated, and diminished, with a sense of emptiness, a painful void of existence, of being disembodied with no clear demarcation between and others. (2) Not surprisingly, false beliefs (delusions) and perceptual aberrations (hallucinations) emerge from a fragmented sense of self. Patients fail to recognize that their actions, thoughts, or feelings are initiated from within the self, leading to delusions of passivity and being controlled by an outside force. One's impulses are misperceived as being imposed by an alien. One's thoughts, fantasies, and memories become external hallucinations instead of internal recollections. It is not surprising that depersonalization and derealization are common in schizophrenia and in the prodrome stage. Phencyclidine and ketamine, which can produce schizophrenia-like psychoses, are known to trigger dissociative phenomena and a loss of a coherent sense of self. What causes the disintegration of the mind (self) in schizophrenia? The leading neurobiologic explanation is well-documented white matter pathology. (3) Numerous studies have demonstrated that the myelinated axons and fibers that connect various brain regions are abnormal in patients with schizophrenia. The evidence for the breakdown of white matter--and, consequently, brain connectedness and integration--includes several lines of evidence, such as: a) in vivo neuroimaging studies using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) that show abnormal water mobility in the myelin; b) genetic aberrations in myelin genes; c) postmortem evidence of reduced oligodendrocytes, the glial cells that manufacture myelin; and d) biochemical markers such as the calcium-binding protein S100B, which is released by compromised glial cells. (3) Therefore, it is reasonable to think that the disruption of the sense of and its proprioception may be due to the extensive disconnectivity of brain regions caused by myelin pathology. (4) However, grey matter abnormality also may play a role in loss of mental proprioceptive functions, which causes a failure to properly recognize one's self. The inferior parietal cortex, which controls body image, concept of self, sensory integration, and executive function, has been reported to be structurally impaired in patients with schizophrenia. …",

The term, “sui generis,” emphasizes this. Addiction involves an intense focus on using, with a motivational salience to use frequently, and to engage in associated behavior, cognition, and conation -- to the point that it takes over the user’s life, superceding common sense, reasonable judgment, and acceptable behavior. Addiction is usually accompanied by physical dependence, but is not the same thing: that is, using to avoid withdrawal is not the same as using to gratify addictive craving. But physical dependence or other motivations may appear as “pseudo-addiction.” Addictive craving is not a psychological derivative of other motivations (though an addict will say otherwise). In its pathogenesis, occasional alcohol or drug use becomes routine. Then, regular use becomes a turning point for many, toward addiction.",

      "title": "Microdosing psychedelics in the treatment of ADHD and comorbid disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract Microdosing psychedelics has garnered considerable attention within both nonprofessional circles and the scientific community in recent years. This method involves taking small, non-hallucinogenic doses of substances like LSD or psilocybin over weeks or months, purportedly to enhance specific behaviors, emotions, or address psychiatric conditions. Exploring these assertions is crucial given the potential therapeutic value of microdosing, especially in conditions that respond positively to full psychedelic doses, such as depression. The full psychedelic experience might not always be suitable due to various factors like age, capacity to consent or comprehend the experience (e.g., dementia), or individual personality traits that might hinder surrendering to the experience. Microdosing could potentially serve as a maintenance therapy post-full dose administration, aiding specific psychological or biological processes during therapy or therapeutic exercises. Recent studies in healthy individuals highlight that small psychedelic doses have nuanced effects on pain perception, mood, neuroplasticity, sleep duration, brain connectivity, and default mode network synchronicity. However, some parameters show null effects after both single and repeated administration. Our survey research uncovered that individuals with ADHD reported symptom relief through microdosing, deeming it more effective than their conventional treatments. Subsequently, we conducted a naturalistic study following individuals with ADHD across a 4-week microdosing period. Our findings indicated a reduction in symptoms over time, an increase in trait mindfulness, and a decrease in neuroticism compared to baseline. While these results are intriguing, they necessitate validation in a clinical trial. We have recently concluded such a trial and are currently analyzing the data to further explore these effects.

      "abstract": "Abstract Insomnia is a disorder characterized by chronic sleep disturbance associated with daytime disability or distress, such as memory impairment and fatigue, that occurs despite adequate opportunity for sleep. Insomnia may present as difficulty falling/staying asleep or as sleep that is nonrestorative. Studies show a strong correlation between insomnia and impaired quality of life. Pain conditions and depression are commonly associated with insomnia, either as secondary or comorbid conditions. In addition, a greater incidence of anxiety, alcohol and drug dependence, and cardiovascular disease is found in people with insomnia. Data indicate insomnia results from over-engaged arousal systems. Insomnia patients experience increased metabolic rate, body temperature, and heart rate, and elevated levels of norepinephrine and catecholamines. Pharmacologic options for the treatment of insomnia include benzodiazepine hypnotics, a selective melatonin receptor agonist, and sedating antidepressants. However, insomnia may be best treated with cognitive-behavioral therapy and instruction in good sleep hygiene, either alone or in concert with pharmacologic agents. Studies on the effects of insomnia treatment use variable methodologies or do not publish negative results, and there are currently no studies of treatment focusing on morbidity. Further research is necessary to better understand the effects of insomnia therapies on medical and psychiatric disorders. In this Clinical Information Supplement, Thomas Roth, PhD, describes the nature of insomnia and its pathophysiology. Next, Andrew D. Krystal, MD, MS, reviews morbidities associated with insomnia. Finally, Joseph A. Lieberman III, MD, MPH, provides an overview of therapeutics utilized in patients with insomnia, including behavioral therapies and pharmacologic options.",

      "title": "Acute confusional state vs psychological and behavioral symptoms of dementia. About a case",
      "abstract": "Introduction Acute confusional state is usually the main diagnosis we encounter in hospitalized older adults. Its incidence increases in parallel with age. Often underdiagnosed. The main characteristics are alteration in the level of consciousness and/or attention, cognitive impairment (disorientation or reduction in memory), relatively rapid onset and fluctuations. As clinical manifestations there is usually disorganization of thought, perceptual disorders, hyper or hypoactivity, alteration of sleep rhythm and alteration of mood. Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) describes a heterogeneous group of behavioral or mood disturbances, such as agitation, anxiety, depression, psychosis, or sleep disorders. They are universal and are present in dementia of any etiology and can be observed in any phase of the disease. They are considered multifactorial and are characterized by a recurrent or sporadic course. 68-year-old female patient who went to the hospital due to the presentation of symptoms that had been going on for 3 months (memory lapses, insomnia and irritability) that had intensified in recent days, leading to the appearance of visual hallucinations, episodes of disconnection from the environment, their language becomes impoverished and a disintegrated and incoherent speech appears with difficulty in naming. Objectives Propose differential diagnosis between confusional syndrome and psychological and behavioral symptoms of dementia. Methods Analytical: elevation of acute phase reactants. Cranial CT: no findings that justify the diagnostic suspicion. Neurology: despite the sudden onset of the symptoms, they rule out performing LP, given the unremarkable nature of the rest of the complementary tests. It was decided to admit him to mental health to study the condition. The evolution is characterized by a fluctuating picture while the acute phase reactants begin to gradually increase, D-Dimer: 5500 and an ECG with an S1Q3T3 pattern. CT angiography is requested (ruling out PET) Finally, after evaluation by neurology in which new analysis is requested along with urine and culture (+ for C.Glabrata) due to fever peak, lumbar puncture and cranial MRI (small acute ischemic lesions). Finally, it was decided to admit him to neurology with targeted treatment, resulting in resolution of the condition. Results Confusional syndrome with a subacute course of etiology under study. Conclusions BPSD of dementia are multifactorial and include different neurobiological factors, as well as environmental, social and psychological factors. They generally have a recurrent or sporadic character and can appear in all phases of any type of dementia, although they do not usually occur acutely. Therefore, it is important not to lose sight of carrying out complementary tests and a multidisciplinary approach, given that psychopathology of acute-subacute onset should not make us forget to rule out an acute confusional state.

      "abstract": "1. Puberty and adolescence mainly can have a bad effect on idiopathic generalized epilepsies. This can show up in the first onset of seizures in adolescence, e.g. as a form of idiopathic grand mal on awakening, juvenile absence epilepsy or juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (impulsive petit mal). Also, already diagnosed absence epilepsy can become worse, e.g. by recurring absence seizures or grand mal seizures or the new onset of grand mal on awakening. 2. Exogenous factors, like changing the time of sleeping and waking, lack of sleep and the abuse of alcohol, play an important role in these types of epilepsy. Cutting out these factors is just as important as the consequent drug treatment on a longterm basis. 3. Drug treatment of idiopathic generalized epilepsy will be done with valproate, barbiturates and ethosuximide. Regarding fatal complications of liver function, which are more frequent than previously thought of, valproate can be recommended as a drug of first choice, especially in early childhood and when a combination of drugs is used. 4. A very good effect of adolescence is seen in children with benign idiopathic focal epilepsy with a centro-temporal spike focus. Antiepileptic treatment with carbamazepine as an agent of first choice can be done less vigorously. 5. Menstruation usually only modifies but does not worsen the natural course of epilepsy. There is still no real therapeutical plan for this rare form of epilepsy. 6. It cannot be a general rule, not to change current medical treatment before or during puberty in order to avoid any worsening of seizures. A decision always has to be made regarding the form of epilepsy and the individual situation, which has to be discussed with the patient and perhaps his family.",

One of the direct consequences is poorer quality sleep. It has also been proven that sleep-related symptoms correspond to significant changes in the respiratory center, airway resistance, and muscle contractility. The main sleep disorder that these patients may present is Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS), which is characterized by repetitive airway obstruction during sleep with complete or partial cessation of airflow. This alteration can have effects on the circadian rhythm of the sleep-wake cycle, such as a desynchronization of the light-dark cycle or endogenously desynchronized, resulting in: insomnia, fatigue, and poor performance in daily activities and symptoms such as insomnia or hypersomnia, common in patients with circadian sleep disorders, although there are other causes to which they can be attributed and that must be excluded before making the diagnosis of a circadian sleep disorder. In a patient without another sleep pathology, a daily record of activities, meals, exercise, naps, and bedtime is an essential tool to evaluate circadian sleep disorders.",

      "abstract": "When a patient taking an antipsychotic is not experiencing symptomatic remission, or is experiencing adverse effects (AEs) that are intolerable or damaging to his or her physical health, a change in medication may be the best path to a good outcome. However, many clinicians are reluctant to switch medications in all but the clearest cases of failure. This reluctance is intensified by the occurrence of AEs caused by transitioning patients too rapidly between agents with different receptor-binding profiles. Emergent antipsychotic-switching syndromes include the \"withdrawal triad,\" comprised of cholinergic rebound, supersensitivity psychosis, and emergent withdrawal dyskinesias (and other motor syndromes). More recently, another element has been observed consistent with an activation syndrome. This activation syndrome may occur as a consequence of switching from highly sedative agents or as a consequence of initial prodopaminergic drive. All of these effects can be minimized by careful planning of gradual switch procedures and judicious use of adjunctive medications.",

The fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual danger posed by the situation and the symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in functioning. Often patients have more than one specific phobia. Children may be less able to spontaneously articulate their fears and the presenting symptoms may include nonspecific behaviors such as crying, tantrums, freezing, or clinging. A specific phobia can be distinguished from a developmentally appropriate fear by the persistence, severity, and degree of associated functional impairment. The treatment of choice for specific phobia is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) including exposure therapy and systematic desensitization.",

Many psychotropic drugs and their active metabolites, if any, have very long half-lives that extend for 2 days or longer. Examples are chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, fluoxetine, vortioxetine, aripiprazole, brexpiprazole, cariprazine, penfluridol, donepezil, and memantine. Other drugs with long half-lives that psychiatrists may prescribe include levothyroxine and zonisamide. Psychotropic drugs with long half-lives take long to reach steady state; this is seldom a problem. They also take long to wash out; this is an advantage because the risk of drug withdrawal or discontinuation syndromes is small, and a disadvantage if rapid washout is desired for any reason, including the experience of drug adverse effects or toxicity, or the discovery of an unplanned pregnancy. Other clinical issues related to drugs with long half-lives include the relevance of occasional missed doses, the possibility of once-weekly dosing, and the need for pregnancy planning.",

The disturbance of purposive movements cannot be termed apraxia, however, if the patient suffers from any elementary motor or sensory deficit (i.e., paresis, dystonia, ataxia), which could fully explain the abnormal motor behavior, or if it results from a language comprehension disorder or from dementia (1,2). Nevertheless, praxic errors are well defined clinically and kinematically and can be superimposed on elementary motor disorders (3,4). Praxic disturbances may affect specific parts of the body (i.e., limb apraxia, buccofacial apraxia, gait apraxia) and may involve both sides of the body (i.e., ideational and ideomotor apraxias), preferentially one side (i.e., limb-kinetic apraxia) or, alternatively, interlimb coordination, as in the case of gait apraxia.",

Causal and modulating factors include hormones fluctuations, such as estrogen, progesterone, and allopregnolone, pathways imbalances, such as oxytocin and kynurenine, chronobiological factors, and brain imaging alterations. Treatment may differ from the traditional major depression management, while selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as sertraline are commonly used and suggested by guidelines, neurosteroids such as brexanolone and the more convenient zuranolone have been recently approved. Newer neurosteroids such as ganaxolone, valaxanolone, and lysaxanolone are currently under development, but also esketamine and psychedelics are promising potential treatments. Other somatic treatments including brain stimulation techniques and light therapy also showed benefit. PPD is therefore increasingly understood as, at least partially, independent from major depressive disorder. Specific and individualized treatments including pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies are progressively being introduced in the routine clinical practice.",

      "abstract": "The difficulty of assessing the effects of mind- altering drugs on human behavior, especially conduct in real-life situations, is discussed. Problems in classification of drugs are also noted; it is emphasized that assumed drug effects are, at best, statements of probability. In considering crimes associated with drug use, it is necessary to distinguish between crimes based on drug use itself, which include all offenses for illicit acquisition, possession, and use of dangerous drugs and narcotics, and dangerous behavior resulting from use. The evidence is clearest for alcohol, revealing a distinct relationship between alcohol use and health hazard, suicide, accidents, and violence. The evidence is less clear for heroin, since most users are delinquent prior to being identified as \"addicts\" so that continued criminality after heroin use cannot be \"caused\" by narcotics. That the kind of criminality engaged in is influenced by drug use does seem a reasonable conclusion. Evidence about the degree of risk for the use of other drugs (sedatives, stimulants, hallucinogens, volatile intoxicants, and the like) and crime is absent. Generally, it appears that most Americans use drugs without major ill- effects—including occasional illicit use. Those likely to be engaged in drug use and in crime are likely to be urban slum- dwelling males, with an overrepresentation of minority groups. Such behavior is apt to be part of a life pattern of deficit and disorder.",

      "title": "Brain Death",
      "abstract": "The term \"brain death\" (BD) is used to indicate a clinical situation characterized by the irreversible loss of all brain functions; the identification of this condition is closely linked to the development of intensive care medicine that, with mechanical ventilation, allows the maintenance of somatic functions even when cerebral functions are ceased. BD diagnosis is essentially based on the presence of three cardinal clinic criteria: 1) coma or unresponsiveness, 2) absence of brainstem reflexes 3) absence of spontaneous breathing, evaluated with apnea test. For BD diagnosis the following prerequisites must be scrupolously considered: knowledge of the proximate cause of coma and confirmation of its irreversibility; exclusion of confounding clinical variables (severe electrolyte, acid-base, endocrine disturbances); hypothermia and/or hypotension; drug intoxication or poisoning. Ancillary tests used in BD confirmation are represented by neurophysiological methods to highlight the loss of bioelectrical brain activity (EEG, evoked potential (EP)) and methods for demonstration of cerebral circulatory arrest (TransCranial Doppler (TCD); Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography ( SPECT); conventional Digital Subtraction Angiography (DSA); CT angiography; MRI angiography). There is insufficient evidence to determine whether ancillary tests are able to confirm the complete cessation of all brain functions and then, in adults, ancillary tests are not needed for the clinical diagnosis of brain death and they should never replace the clinical neurological examination. However, even though ancillary tests are not mandatory but only optional in many countries, they continue to be used, especially when there are factors that may interfere with the complete clinical assessment or when apnea test cannot be performed. Although BD is a relatively simple clinical diagnosis, there are substantial differences in perceptions and practices regarding its declaration among countries, states and even between hospitals worldwide. There are also cultural and religious obstacles—especially in lower-income countries—to the determination of death with neurologic criteria, which lead to the suspension of mechanical ventilation. Therefore, health organizations should implement educational campaigns to improve knowledge and awareness of current criteria among the population, and national and international scientific societies should also make every efforts to validate and standardize clinical and laboratory criteria. Finally, it should reminded and underlined that the ultimate purpose of brain death determination should be to increase the number of organs donated, to improve the quality of life of organ recipients.",

In the course of a test program for medicinal therapy of this syndrome we studied the efficacy of a vincamine containing formulation (Pervincamin forte retard or Pervincamin ampoules, respectively) on the symptoms of a chronical brain disturbance. The study was randomised double-blind. We found that under the influence of the vincamine formulation the subjective symptoms, such as lack of interest, apathy, aggressiveness, raging, psychomotoric retardation, lack of concentration, dysmnesia, decreased with a statistical significance (p less than or equal to 0.05). Also the subjective symptoms, reported by the patients, such as tinnitus and vertigo decreased significantly under the treatment with the vincamine preparation. Therefore some of the parameters important for resocialisation and revitalisation of old patients could be influenced in a favourable way. Basing on the good results of our investigations, the treatment of psychiatric disturbances in old patients with vincamine containing drugs seems to be justified.",

Like other drugs with abuse potential cannabis affects the brain's reward system. It has not been possible to show major structural changes in the cerebrum, but by electron microscopy structural changes can be shown in animals especially in the hippocampus. The drug is taken in order to escape reality, and a vicious circle tending to maintain the person's abuse pattern which includes reduced energy, judgment and memory may be established. Cannabis may cause toxic psychosis, with a tendency to recurrent psychoses with continued abuse. There is no convincing support for the assumption that cannabis can cause chronic functional psychosis following cessation of abuse. Schizophrenic patients who use cannabis are often trying to reduce the discomfort caused by symptoms in the prodromal phase. By continued abuse positive psychotic symptoms are worsened. Antidepressant drugs may diminish the depressive elements of the disease. Some cannabis users are especially sensitive and develop toxic psychosis. Patients with repeated toxic psychosis may erroneously be diagnosed as schizophrenics. It is therefore important to be aware that a psychotic state may be caused by abuse of cannabis, and adjust treatment to this fact.",

Psychological problems require the involvement of loved ones. They also require education concerning psychopathology. Sometimes, a situation set the family up in particularly difficult dilemma. Disturbing patient condition, aggressive behavior, hallucination cause that a patient can become dangerous for yourself or others.

      "title": "O uso excessivo de Metilfenidato na infância e os falsos diagnósticos de Transtorno de Déficit de Atenção e Hiperatividade / Childhood Methylphenidate Overuse and Misdiagnosis of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder",
      "abstract": "Nos dias atuais, o menor indicador de sofrimento psíquico tende a ser caracterizado como patológico, sendo imediatamente administrado um psicofármaco. Nesse sentido, emerge-se o conceito de “ overtreatment ”, que é o ato de medicar em excesso ou então não plenamente condizente com o quadro clínico do paciente, sendo a elevação da prescrição de psicofármacos na última década uma de suas principais manifestações. Portanto, se o uso excessivo de medicamentos já se configura como um panorama preocupante em adultos, a conjuntura torna-se ainda mais grave tratando-se de crianças, haja vista toda a imaturidade neuropsicomorfofuncional. Haja vista toda a polêmica e controvérsia que permeiam a sua abordagem terapêutica, é nesse cenário em que se enquadra o Transtorno de Déficit de Atenção e Hiperatividade (TDAH), transtorno do neurodesenvolvimento definido por níveis prejudiciais de desatenção, desorganização e/ou hiperatividade-impulsividade. Diante do exposto, o desenvolvimento desta pesquisa foi motivado pela necessidade de conhecer os reais impactos do uso de metilfenidato, de modo a compreender terapêuticas alternativas multidisciplinares utilizadas no tratamento do TDAH. O trabalho teve como objetivo a avaliação dos benefícios e malefícios no tratamento medicamentoso com Metilfenidato, além da qualificação dos impactos do uso do Metilfenidato na vida dos pacientes diagnosticados com TDAH e atendidos no Conjunto Hospitalar de Sorocaba (CHS) Como metodologia, realizou-se um estudo longitudinal de modo a acompanhar crianças entre seis e doze anos, durante o seu tratamento para o TDAH por um período de um ano no ambulatório de neuropediatria do CHS. Foram aplicados bimensalmente os questionários “The Behavior Problems Inventory” e “SNAP IV” aos pacientes no intuito de avaliar a evolução de seus respectivos transtornos. Assim sendo, observou-se um total de 17 pacientes, dos quais 11 faziam uso de Metilfenidato (grupo A) e 6 não utilizavam tal medicamento (grupo B). De todas as crianças analisadas, 76,5 % faziam acompanhamento regular com psicoterapia (72,7 % do grupo A e 83,3 % do grupo B) e 64,7 % praticavam regularmente atividades físicas (81,8 % do grupo A e 33,3 % do grupo B). Ademais, foi constatada acentuada melhora dos sintomas (diminuição da frequência e severidade de comportamentos agressivos, estereotipados, hiperativos e desatentos) do TDAH no grupo A, em comparação ao grupo B (sintomas se mantiveram em 100% dos indivíduos observados). Dessa forma, foi consensual, tanto pelos relatórios escolares, quanto pela impressão pessoal dos pacientes e familiares, que a utilização do Metilfenidato acarretou maiores benefícios do que malefícios sobre a qualidade de vida diária de cada criança e, especialmente, no rendimento escolar. É válido ressaltar a importância de uma abordagem multidisciplinar em relação ao diagnóstico e seguimento do paciente com TDAH.",

It may also follow labyrinthine trauma or be associated with a wide variety of diseases interfering with the blood supply to the brainstem or inner ear. Endolymphatic hydrops has been demonstrated in all these conditions, and it is believed that it may occur also in Ménière’s disease. Other causes of the syndrome include inflammatory or demyelinating disorders or tumours involving the eighth nerve. Many drugs have been used to treat Ménière’s disease, but with little success.

      "abstract": "Psychiatric emergencies are conditions that mostly destabilize the already frenetic activity of the Emergency Department. Sometimes the emergency is clearly referable to primitive psychiatric illness. Other times, psychiatric and organic symptoms can independently coexist (comorbidity), or develop together in different conditions of substance abuse, including alcohol and prescription drugs. Differentiating between substance induced and pre-existing psychiatric disorder (dual diagnosis) may be difficult, other than controversial issue. Finally, an organic disease can hide behind a psychiatric disorder (pseudopsychiatric emergency). In this review (part I), psychiatric disorders that occur with organic symptoms are discussed. They include: (1) anxiety, conversion and psychosomatic disorders, and (2) simulated diseases. The physiologic mechanisms of the stress reaction, divided into a dual neuro-hormonal response, are reviewed in this section: (1) activation of the sympathetic nervous system and adrenal medulla with catecholamine production (rapid response), and (2) activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis with cortisol production (slow response). The concept of the fight-or-flight response, its adaptive significance and the potential evolution in paralyzing response, well showing by Yerkes-Dodson curve, is explained. Abnormal short- and long-term reactions to stress evolving toward well codified cluster of trauma and stressor-related disorders, including acute stress disorder, adjustment disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder, are examined. A brief review of major psychiatric disorder and related behaviour abnormalities, vegetative symptoms and cognitive impairment, according to DMS IV-TR classification, are described. Finally, the reactive psychic symptoms and behavioral responses to acute or chronic organic disease, so called \"somatopsychic disorders\", commonly occurring in elderly and pediatric patients, are presented. The specific conditions of post-operative and intensive care unit patients, and cancer and HIV positive population are emphasized.",

      "title": "Typical clinical manifestations of anxiety and depression in patients with medical illness and general notions about their treatment",
      "abstract": "Abstract Anxiety and depression are common psychiatric comorbidities in chronic medical illnesses, such as cardiovascular, endocrine, and neurological diseases. These conditions are associated with greater disease severity, poorer functional outcomes, and reduced quality of life for patients and their families. Despite their significant global burden, they are often underdiagnosed due to overlapping symptoms with primary medical conditions. Symptoms in medically ill patients may differ from classic psychiatric presentations, often involving heterogeneous (psycho)somatic phenomena like fatigue, autonomic irregularities, gastrointestinal symptoms, sleep disturbances, and cognitive impairments. Anxiety typically manifests as hypervigilance, excessive worry, and irritability, while depression presents with persistent sadness, psychomotor slowing, and loss of motivation, pleasure, and interest. Subsyndromal symptoms, though often untreated, can exacerbate functional decline and disease progression. Effective management requires a multimodal approach, with modern psychopharmacotherapy as a cornerstone. Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) and Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs) are recommended first-line treatments due to their safety and efficacy. In case of insufficient response, add-on strategies may include second-generation antipsychotics, lithium, esketamine, or pregabalin for predominant anxiety. Emerging evidence supports the use of phytotherapeutics as Silexan and Rhodiola rosea for subsyndromal symptoms. Non-pharmacological interventions also play an important role. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy remains the first-line psychotherapeutic option, complemented by mindfulness techniques, psychoeducation, biofeedback, and relaxation strategies, particularly for anxiety. Chronobiological treatments like bright-light therapy and sleep deprivation have proven effective for depression, especially in seasonal patterns. Brain stimulation methods, including transcranial magnetic stimulation and electroconvulsive therapy, may also be considered based on individual needs. Importantly, successful physician-patient interactions, directly and promptly addressing emotional and psychological concerns during consultations and daily rounds, are crucial in fostering treatment adherence and improving outcomes. In conclusion, anxiety and depression in medically ill patients present unique diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Early recognition and individualized, multimodal treatment strategies can enhance adherence and outcomes. Integrating pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches within collaborative care models and recommended treatment algorithms is essential for effectively addressing individual clinical presentations.

      "title": "Neuropeptides as Possible Targets in Sleep Disorders: Special Emphasis on Hypocretin-Deficient Narcolepsy",
      "abstract": "Sleep disorders are disturbances of usual sleep patterns or behaviors caused by deregulation of neuronal synchronicity and of the balance of the neurotransmitter system involved in sleep regulation. Insomnia and hypersomnia are frequent sleep disorders, and these are most often treated pharmacologically with hypnotics and wake-promoting compounds. These compounds act on classical neurotransmitter systems, such as benzodiazepines on gamma amino butyric acid (GABA)(A) receptors, and amphetamine-like stimulants on monoaminergic terminals to modulate neurotransmission. In addition, acetylcholine, amino acids, lipids and proteins (cytokines) and peptides, are known to significantly modulate sleep, and thus, are possibly involved in the pathophysiology of some sleep disorders. Due to recent developments in molecular biological techniques, many neuropeptides have been newly identified, and some are found to significantly modulate sleep. Recent discoveries also include the finding that the impairment of hypocretin/orexin neurotransmission (a recently isolated hypothalamic neuropeptide and receptor system), is the major pathophysiology of narcolepsy with cataplexy. A hypocretin replacement therapy is anticipated to reverse the disease symptoms in humans. In this article, we will review the history of neuropeptide research, sleep modulatory effects of various neuropeptides, and the general strategies for the pharmacological therapeutics targeting the peptidergic systems by referring to hypocretin-deficient narcolepsy as an immediate example.",

      "abstract": "New-onset vertigo, dizziness and gait imbalance are amongst the most common symptoms presenting to the emergency department, accounting for 2.1-4.4% of all patients. The broad spectrum of underlying causes in these patients cuts across many specialties, which often results in diagnostic challenges. For patients meeting the diagnostic criteria for acute vestibular syndrome (AVS, i.e., presenting with acute-onset prolonged vertigo/dizziness with accompanying gait imbalance, motion intolerance, nausea/vomiting, with or without nystagmus), the typical differential diagnosis is vertebrobasilar stroke and acute unilateral vestibulopathy. However, other disorders may also present with AVS. These include non-neurological causes such as drug side-effects or intoxication, electrolyte disturbances, cardiac disease, severe anemia, carbon monoxide poisoning, endocrine disorders and others. Other non-stroke neurological disorders may also present with AVS or episodic vertigo/dizziness, including demyelinating CNS diseases, posterior fossa mass lesions, acute thiamine deficiency and vestibular migraine. Furthermore, acute physiological abnormalities (e.g., hypotension, fever, severe anemia) may unmask previous vestibular impairments that had been well-compensated. Here, we review the diagnostic approach to patients with acute-onset dizziness in the emergency room and discuss the most important differential diagnoses beyond stroke and acute unilateral vestibulopathy.",

      "title": "Symptomkontrolle am Lebensende",
      "abstract": "Symptom Control at the End of Life Abstract. Patients with advanced disease suffer from multiple physical and psychological symptoms. These include pain, weakness, lack of energy, weight loss, breathlessness, nausea and vomiting, constipation, and depression. In the dying phase, death rattle, delirium and terminal agitation may be additional problems. Palliative care focusses on alleviating these symptoms, taking into account the physical, psychological, social and spiritual dimension. Main principles of symptom control in palliative care are 1) considering differential diagnoses of the causes of the symptom to be able to treat potentially reversible causes, 2) using preventive measures and 3) symptomatic treatment - on its own or in combination with causal therapy. The following should be noted regarding pharmacological treatment: In case of permanent symptoms, the drugs have to be given at fixed times, in accordance with their duration of action, to achieve a constant blood level. In addition to this regular drug administration, prn medication should be prescribed, e. g., for pain, breathlessness, and nausea. If oral administration is not possible, drugs can be administered intravenously, subcutaneously or transdermally via patches. Non-pharmacological measures can be used additionally or primarily for symptom control. This paper presents important aspects of symptom control for pain, breathlessness, nausea and vomiting, constipation, and depression as well as for symptoms in the dying phase. It concludes by adding a few words on sedation in palliative care as a measure of last resort.Zusammenfassung. Patient_innen in fortgeschrittenen Krankheitsstadien leiden unter vielfältigen physischen und psychischen Beschwerden. Dazu gehören Schmerzen, Schwäche, Energielosigkeit, Gewichtsverlust, Atemnot, Übelkeit, Erbrechen, Verstopfung und Depression. In der Sterbephase können Rasselatmung, Delir und / oder terminale Unruhe hinzukommen. Der Fokus palliativmedizinischer Behandlung liegt auf der Linderung dieser belastenden Symptome unter Berücksichtigung der körperlichen, psychischen, sozialen und spirituellen Dimension. Zu den Grundsätzen der palliativmedizinischen Symptomkontrolle gehören 1) eine angemessene differentialdiagnostische Ursachenklärung des Symptoms zur Behandlung potenziell reversibler Ursachen, 2) der Einsatz von präventiven Massnahmen und 3) die Durchführung einer symptomatischen Therapie – allein oder parallel zu einer ursächlichen Therapie. Bezüglich der medikamentösen Therapiemassnahmen ist Folgendes zu beachten: Bei dauerhaft vorhandenen Symptomen müssen die Medikamente entsprechend ihrer Wirkdauer nach einem festen Zeitschema gegeben werden, um einen möglichst konstanten Wirkspiegel zu erreichen. Zusätzlich zu einer solchen Dauermedikation ist zum Beispiel für Schmerzen, Atemnot und Übelkeit Bedarfsmedikation zu verschreiben. Wenn die orale Gabe nicht möglich ist, können Medikamente intravenös, subkutan oder transdermal mittels Pflaster verabreicht werden. Nichtmedikamentöse Massnahmen können ergänzend oder auch primär zur Symptomlinderung eingesetzt werden. Dieser Beitrag stellt wichtige Aspekte der Symptomkontrolle bei Schmerzen, Atemnot, Übelkeit und Erbrechen, Obstipation, Depression sowie bei Symptomen in der Sterbephase vor und schliesst mit wenigen Worten zum Thema «Sedierung in der Palliativversorgung» als Ultima-Ratio-Massnahme.",

Analysing such questions is indispensable during criminal actions where the responsibility and culpability of the offender is to be considered. The examination of the offender's mental state may help to recognise undiagnosed neuro-psychiatric conditions. The case of a man, suspected to have violently murdered his spouse is reported. During his criminal act he was probably in a pathological mental state caused by alcoholic drunkenness and decreased emotional control; besides he may have ictal or interictal disturbance of consciousness. The alcoholic state does not limit culpability, while epileptic disturbance of consciousness may exempt the offender.",

      "title": "Sonolência excessiva",
      "abstract": "A sonolência é uma função biológica, definida como uma probabilidade aumentada para dormir. Já a sonolência excessiva (SE), ou hipersonia, refere-se a uma propensão aumentada ao sono com uma compulsão subjetiva para dormir, tirar cochilos involuntários e ataques de sono, quando o sono é inapropriado. As principais causas de sonolência excessiva são a privação crônica de sono (sono insuficiente), a Síndrome da Apnéia e Hipopnéia Obstrutiva do Sono (SAHOS), a narcolepsia, a Síndrome das Pernas Inquietas/Movimentos Periódicos de Membros (SPI/MPM), Distúrbios do Ritmo Circadiano, uso de drogas e medicações e a hipersonia idiopática. As principais conseqüências são prejuízo no desempenho nos estudos, no trabalho, nas relações familiares e sociais, alterações neuropsicológicas e cognitivas e risco aumentado de acidentes. O tratamento da sonolência excessiva deve estar voltado para as causas específicas. Na privação voluntária do sono, aumentar o tempo de sono e higiene do sono, o uso do CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure) na Síndrome da Apnéia e Hipopnéia Obstrutiva do Sono, exercícios e agentes dopaminérgicos na Síndrome das Pernas Inquietas/Movimentos Periódicos de Membros, fototerapia e melatonina nos Distúrbios do Ritmo Circadiano, retiradas de drogas que causam sonolência excessiva e uso de estimulantes da vigília.",

      "title": "Hallucinogens",
      "abstract": "Hallucinogens. Nichols DE. Pharmacol Ther. 2004;101:131–181National Institute on Drug Abuse Web Site. Available at http://www.drugabuse.govThe Psychopharmacology of Hallucinogens. Abraham HD, Aldridge AM, Gogia P. Neuropsychopharmacol. 1996;14:285–298Toxic Psychoses as Pharmacological Models of Schizophrenia. Potvin S, Stip E, Roy J. Curr Psychiatr Rev. 2005;1:23–32The hallucinogens comprise a group of drugs that alters perception, cognition, and mood. Despite their name, hallucinogens only sometimes cause true hallucinations, defined as perceiving experiences that do not occur. These substances exert their mind-altering effects primarily through agonism at serotonin receptors (specifically 5-HT2a) in the central nervous system. There is some controversy over which drugs of abuse fit neatly into the category of hallucinogens. Although phencyclidine (PCP) may cause hallucinations, it is classified as a dissociative drug. Other drugs of abuse such as cocaine, anticholinergics, marijuana, and methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or “ecstasy”) can alter perception or produce hallucinations, but these drugs are not classified as hallucinogens because of different mechanisms of action and numerous other important physiologic and toxicologic effects.The best-known hallucinogen is the semisynthetic compound lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). Naturally occurring hallucinogens include psilocybin, obtained from Psilocybe cubensis or “magic mushrooms,” and mescaline, derived from the peyote cactus. Lesser known but similar compounds include N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), derived from many botanical sources, and lysergic acid amide (LSA), derived from morning glory seeds. Although most of these compounds are ingested, DMT is smoked or inhaled nasally.Historically, hallucinogens have been used for religious ceremonies, recreational abuse, and even research purposes to induce alterations of perception. The Monitoring the Future Survey of the National Institute on Drug Abuse provides an annual assessment of the extent of drug use among 8th-, 10th-, and 12th-grade students nationwide. The use by adolescents of hallucinogens as a class, and specifically of LSD, began to decline in the 1990s. Use of these drugs has remained stable at historically low levels of lifetime use: 3.5% of 8th graders and 9.7% of 12th graders stated use on data collected from 2002 through 2004.Physiologic effects of hallucinogen use include paresthesias, dizziness, weakness, drowsiness, nausea, and blurred vision. The desired effect is altered perception by the user. Typical perceptual symptoms include distortion of shapes and colors and hallucinations that usually are visual. A classic, although uncommon, hallucinogen-induced perceptual change is synesthesia, in which one sense is perceived as another. For example, a user who has synesthesia may feel that he or she is “hearing” colors or “seeing” smells. Hallucinogen users may experience distorted cognition and have difficulty expressing thoughts or an imprecise sense of time. Users may describe a transcendent or dreamlike state. Mood often is affected greatly and varies from euphoria to a “bad trip,” in which the user experiences profound anxiety or fear.Unlike many other drugs of abuse, no current evidence suggests direct end-organ toxicity or overdose fatalities from hallucinogens. The acute danger of hallucinogens, instead, comes from their effect on judgment while the individual is in an altered state. Although reports are relatively rare, the unsupervised, altered patient may have a deadly accident, as in an attempt to fly. Irreversible ocular damage has been reported from staring at the sun. There is no evidence that these substances are physiologically addictive or produce a withdrawal syndrome.A long-term adverse outcome of hallucinogen use is the occurrence of “flashbacks,” now more appropriately referred to as hallucinogen persisting perception disorder. This condition consists of episodes of re-experiencing one or more of the perceptual symptoms previously induced by hallucinogen use after the drug has worn off and in the absence of another disorder, such as psychiatric illness. Although case reports of this phenomenon exist, it is believed to be rare.Symptoms of hallucinogen intoxication may be difficult to distinguish from those of psychiatric illness, particularly schizophrenia. Lack of a family history of psychiatric disorders, absence of symptoms when the drug has cleared, and variable severity of symptoms that can be related to an ingestion suggest hallucinogen toxicity. Although hallucinogens may cause visual perceptual disturbances and visual hallucinations, they do not cause the disorganized thinking, true delusions, and auditory hallucinations that are typical of schizophrenia.The treatment of a patient who is suspected of being under the influence of a hallucinogen is primarily supportive. Acutely intoxicated patients should be placed in a calm, quiet, protected environment and provided contact with familiar people and objects. Those experiencing a “bad trip” may benefit from benzodiazepines.Comment: The word hallucinogen, derived from Latin, means to wander in mind or talk idly. Research on hallucinogens has been challenging because these preparations exert varying effects, depending on the perception of the user and the setting where the use has taken place. The therapeutic benefits of these drugs have been debated. Additional research is needed to explore the neurocognitive effects of hallucinogens in an attempt to understand consciousness better, reduce anxiety in terminally ill patients facing death, and perhaps understand the mechanisms of certain mental illnesses, such as psychoses and schizophrenia.",

      "abstract": "Il est classique de dire que le deuil va entraîner des conséquences biopsychosociales. Mais, nous pouvons être confrontés à d’authentiques symptômes psychiatriques, ce qui va conduire à la notion de deuil pathologique. La liste des symptômes psychiatriques est encore mal connue des non-spécialistes : – de la réaction dépressive à l’épisode dépressif sévère avec idées de suicide, voire un suicide tenté, plus rarement abouti ; – de la phase d’hyperactivité à l’authentique épisode maniaque ; – du trouble fonctionnel à la maladie psychosomatique, voire à la conversion hystérique ; – de la manifestation anxieuse passagère à la grande crise d’angoisse, voire au trouble anxieux généralisé ; – des manifestations phobiques, des conduites à risque, des addictions ou des automutilations. Tous ces symptômes auront des expressions différentes selon l’âge : par exemple, des manifestations d’opposition ou de phobie scolaire chez l’enfant ou l’adolescent ou bien une dépression d’allure démentielle chez la personne âgée. Lorsque des symptômes psychiatriques sont présents, la conduite à tenir qui sera adoptée sera d’évaluer ces troubles (parfois avec des échelles) et surtout de les relier à la dynamique du chemin de deuil. La prise en charge doit mettre le deuil au centre de la réflexion : – en traitant l’individu, en appréciant : ∘ la spécificité de son deuil : pré-deuil, deuil « blanc », deuil « non élaboré », deuil de l’enfant, de l’adolescent, de l’adulte, de la personne âgée voire très âgée, les circonstances de la mort du proche : mort d’un enfant, mort par suicide, par homicide, par accident survenant pendant un transport (voiture, train, bateau, etc.) après une catastrophe naturelle, si la mort est brutale et que la personne y a assisté ou si elle a failli elle-même mourir ; – en traitant le groupe : ∘ familial avec une approche transgénérationnelle, ∘ d’individus bénéficiant d’une prise en charge groupale : avec un même type d’endeuillés ou avec des endeuillés de causes différentes.",

      "abstract": "Sudden death is natural death, heralded by loss of consciousness within 1 hour of the onset of acute symptoms. The time and mode of death are unexpected. This definition is meant to satisfy medical and scientific considerations as well legal and social concerns. Included within this construct are four temporal elements: (a) prodromes, (b) onset of terminal event, (c) cardiac arrest, and (d) progression to biological death. Prodromes, if any, are new or worsening symptoms that begin during an arbitrarily defined period of up to 24 hours before the onset of cardiac arrest. The 1-hour time period described in the definition refers to the duration of the terminal event leading to cardiac arrest. Following cardiac arrest – the clinician's synonym for sudden death, biological death may ensue within minutes, or alternatively, due to community-based interventions and life support systems, may be delayed for a long period of time and even aborted altogether. Nonetheless, for legal, forensic, and certain social considerations, biological death is used as the absolute definition of death.",

      "title": "Malignant Catatonia: A Review for the Intensivist",
      "abstract": "Catatonia is a clinical syndrome characterized by psychomotor, neurological and behavioral changes. The clinical picture of catatonia ranges from akinetic stupor to severe motoric excitement. Catatonia can occur in the setting of a primary psychiatric condition such as bipolar disorder or secondary to a general medical illness like autoimmune encephalitis. Importantly, it can co-occur with delirium or coma. Malignant catatonia describes catatonia that presents with clinically significant autonomic abnormalities including change in temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate. It is a life-threatening form of acute brain dysfunction that has several motoric manifestations and occurs secondary to a primary psychiatric condition or a medical cause. Many of the established predisposing and precipitating factors for catatonia such as exposure to neuroleptic medications or withdrawal states are common in the setting of critical illness. Catatonia typically improves with benzodiazepines and treatment of its underlying psychiatric or medical conditions, with electroconvulsive therapy reserved for catatonia refractory to benzodiazepines or for malignant catatonia. However, some forms of catatonia, such as catatonia secondary to a general medical condition or catatonia comorbid with delirium, may be less responsive to traditional treatments. Prompt recognition and treatment of catatonia are crucial because malignant catatonia may be fatal without treatment. Given the high morbidity and mortality associated with malignant catatonia, intensivists should familiarize themselves with this important and under-recognized condition.",

When the myth involves a therapeutic agent, more frequently, a pharmacological compound, the \"factual cloak\" surrounding the myth may even creep into the regulatory approval process for that group of agents. Such a body of \"20th-century clinical impressionism\" has developed around the β-adrenergic receptor—blocking drugs. It is true that certain patients develop depression while receiving β-blockers; and this risk is said to be greater if the patient originally suffered from mental depression. Other problems ascribed to this class of agents concern exercise intolerance and impaired mental performance.

Toxicity is characterized by slurred speech, impaired judgment, and unsteady gait; overdose results in stupor, coma, respiratory depression, vasomotor collapse, and even death. Withdrawal symptoms include agitation, restlessness, insomnia, anxiety, and seizures. Sedative use should be suspected in individuals with clinical signs of toxicity. Benzodiazepines and barbiturates can be detected in standard urine drug tests. Cognitive impairment and increased risk of accidental injury and falls are the most serious medical complications. Patients can be withdrawn with a taper of a long-acting benzodiazepine or phenobarbital; inpatient treatment may be required for severe use disorder or withdrawal.

Neanmoins, la necessite d’une absence de conscience en soi n’est pas forcement souhaitable, contrairement a une periode per-operatoire chirurgicale. En effet, la perte de conscience n’est pas synonyme de confort (et d’ailleurs elle diminue le depistage des douleurs). En fait, les hypnotiques les plus souvent utilises dans ce contexte (benzodiazepine, propofol) ont des effets nefastes sur la qualite du sommeil. De plus, l’immobilisation liee a la sedation pourrait participer a un deconditionnement musculaire et favoriser la survenue de neuromyopathies acquises en reanimation. Les benzodiazepines sont pourvoyeuses de delire (facteur de risque de mortalite). L’absence totale de souvenirs serait de plus un facteur de risque de syndrome de stress post-traumatique ulterieur. Les sedatifs ont par ailleurs des effets hemodynamiques non negligeables. Des etudes prospectives etudiant une strategie d’absence ou l’arret journalier de la sedation ont montre une diminution de la duree de ventilation artificielle avec une tendance a la diminution de la mortalite. Une strategie d’epargne de la sedation compatible avec l’obtention d’un etat calme et confortable pour le patient de reanimation est faisable et probablement souhaitable tant pout eviter des effets deleteres « immediats » que pour ameliorer la qualite de vie apres la reanimation.",

According to it, anxiety is conceptualized as a negative or unpleasant emotion characterized by subjective distress, high physiological activation, unadapted motor responses; at the same time, anxiety is linked to individual differences in certain situational areas (specific traits). Anxiety reactions appear due to subject perceives that a certain situation seems threating (situation's appraisal), with no apparent solution due to a lack of resources (coping abilities). For somebody, certain consummatory behaviors such as eating, alcohol consumption, smoking, or drug abuse could relieve distress symptoms or reduce physiological activation producing by anxiety. However, such consumption behaviors could become more and more necessary in order to alleviate anxiety symptoms or avoiding the withdrawal, which is a clinical syndrome including intense anxiety manifestations. The possibility to stop the consumption is interpreted as a threatening situation which provokes more anxiety; the only coping response available is to maintain consumption. Regarding addiction treatments, there are significant interactions between type of treatment x type of patient. Anxiety is on of the variables evaluated in order to design more effective treatments matched with the characteristics of the patient.",

      "abstract": "Sleep is a state of 'suspended consciousness', a temporary interruption of sensorimotor interaction with the environment. Clinically, the distinguishing feature of sleep, in contrast to coma, is the ease with which the sleeping subject can be roused to awareness of the external world. Between alertness and coma are a variety of altered states of consciousness. Palliative sedation refers to the intentional clinical practice of suppressing consciousness to control refractory symptoms during the last days or hours of life, in a manner that is ethically acceptable to the patient, family and healthcare providers. The intractable symptoms, which have proven non-responsive to all other interventions, are contained by the induction and the continuance of deep sedation. Deep sedation may need to be maintained until death; the duration is usually in the range of 1–6 days. Trial releases of deep sedation can be orchestrated, if required, by withholding the dose or administering flumazenil. The dosage necessary to induce deep sedation is variable.",

The notion of confusional arousals in children has received less attention overall compared with that concerning adults. The impression gained in adults is that, especially in response to forced awakenings, the behavioral disturbance in adult episodes is more forceful, vigorous and resistive, sometimes leading to violent behavior. Childhood confusional arousals do not usually require treatment, only advice to parents that they can be considered to be a passing phase. The same cannot necessarily be said of confusional arousals in adult life when they have more of a tendency to persist, depending on their etiology and relationship to other sleep disorders.",

Кратко рассмотрены механизмы ЦА; приводятся данные о пирролах и пиролурии. Описаны основные неврологические и психиатрические проявления ЦА и пиролурии, а также подходы к их лечению.Отмечено, что имеются все основания полагать, что механизмы возникновения ЦА не имеют существенных отличий от таковых при формировании других аллергических реакций (при пищевой аллергии), основанных на двух основных типах иммунного ответа (сопряженных с избыточной выработкой IgE или с тучными клетками). Симптомы ЦА многочисленны и многообразны. Они зависят от возраста пациентов и могут манифестировать в чрезвычайно широких пределах. Спектр проявлений ЦА варьирует от приступов потери сознания и/или головных болей в сочетании с крапивницей, зудом и нарушениями зрения или транзиторных нарушений речи (афазия и т. д.) до одностороннего онемения конечностей и/или языка, сонливости, ступора, бессонницы, неспособности к концентрации, раздражительности, возбудимости, депрессии, тревожности, головокружения, мышечных проявлений. Проявления ЦА обычно находят выражение в форме конкретных психических нарушений (шизофрения, депрессия, галлюцинации, бред, кататония, эпилепсия, аутизм и т. д.).Указывается, что стандартных методов терапии для ЦА и пиролурии не разработано. Существующие подходы частично являются эмпирическими, а частично теоретически обоснованными. Обычно детям с церебральными проявлениями аллергии назначается гипоаллергенная (элиминационная) диета различной степени интенсивности. При необходимости такая диета может достигать уровня олигоантигенной.",

      "title": "ESP and Altered States of Consciousness: An Overview of Conceptual and Research Trends",
      "abstract": "Parapsychological phenomena has a long tradition of being associated with alterations of consciousness. This tradition extends from the performances of ancient oracles and other diviners to the mesmeric and mediumistic trance, and to more recent claims in the context of laboratory work that used hypnotic suggestion, dreams, meditation, and partial sensory deprivation. Moreover, there has been a long tradition of spontaneous ESP experiences related to dreams and other states of consciousness that have reinforced such associations. In this paper, I will present an overview of the topic of ESP and altered states of consciousness (ASCs). I will not focus on methodological details or specific findings, but, rather, on trends in concepts and research. Other publications cited throughout this paper provide more detailed information (see, e.g Bem & Honorton, 1994; Hardy, 1989; Honorton, 1977; Krippner, 1991; Krippner & George, 1986; Parker, 1975b; Stanford, 1987, 1992; Stanford & Stein, 1994). For practical reasons, I do not discuss mesmerism nor spiritualism in detail, and I do not address other areas such as the psychoanalytic dream ESP literature (e.g., Devereux, 1953). The discussion here will be limited to developments which occurred between the nineteenth century and the 1990s, with an emphasis on twentieth century developments and those since the 1960s. Although I am not suggesting that there are no differences between specific altered states, nor between the concept of dissociation and that of alteration of consciousness, I use the term ASCs in a general sense meaning any state of mind that differs markedly enough from that which we associate with our normal waking selves (Parker, 1975b, p. 8). Depending on definitions, such phenomena as alternating personalities may be considered a form of consciousness alteration, and body image changes during the ganzfeld experience may be seen as a dissociative process in which physical sensations have been separated from conscious awareness. My concern is not to get into these problems of definition, but to represent trends in the literature and general ideas of authors. I hope that what I present will be used by others to clarify our understanding of these concepts. THE NINETEENTH CENTURY Several movements contributed significantly to interest in the relationship between ESP and ASCs. These were mesmerism, spiritualism, and dynamic psychiatry. (For overviews of these topics, see Ellenberger, 1970; Gauld, 1992; and Podmore, 1902). By the middle of the nineteenth century, mesmerism had accumulated a considerable literature, as seen in the writings of Mesmer (Bloch, 1980) and many other workers in the field (e.g., Braid, 1843; Elliotson, 1843; Petetin, 1808).(1) Many observations also focused on clairvoyance and the like (Elliotson, 1845; Haddock, 1851). This period produced many other claims, such as transpositions of the senses, traveling clairvoyance, face-to-face or distant medical diagnosis, seeing the mesmeric fluid around the mesmerist or between the mesmerist and the mesmeree, induction of trance at a distance, and the so-called community of sensation reported between mesmerist and mesmeree (Dingwall, 1967-1968; Gauld, 1992). Some of these phenomena, especially the claim of mesmerized subjects to see the afterworld or to be in contact with deceased or other spirit individuals, provided a link with the later development of spiritualism. As Crabtree (1988) has argued: In Germany, France, England and the United States, the association between magnetic somnambulism and paranormal phenomena of the spiritualistic type was very strong. Many of the books and articles that appeared wove their way back and forth between the two areas, giving the impression that it was impossible to discuss one without dealing with the other. (p. xv) The development of spiritualism changed the focus from mesmerized individuals to those individuals who, in self-induced trances, claimed to communicate with the deceased, and thus reinforced the idea that ASCs were related to ESP (for a review, see Podmore, 1902). …",

      "title": "Making sense of the role of sense organs in trichotillomania",
      "abstract": "Hallopeau, a French dermatologist, coined the term trichotillomania to describe alopecia (baldness) caused by self-traction of the hair, but the term now encompasses the entire syndrome of pathological hair pulling.[1] In Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition (DSM-5),[2] the major change for trichotillomania (hair pulling disorder) is the fact that it and related disorders now have their own chapter in the obsessive–compulsive disorder section. Trichotillomania (hair pulling disorder) includes recurrent pulling out of one's hair, resulting in hair loss, repeated attempts to decrease or stop hair pulling, and the hair pulling causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Furthermore, the hair pulling or hair loss is not attributable to another medical condition (e.g., a dermatological condition), and the hair pulling is not better explained by the symptoms of another mental disorder (e.g., attempts to improve a perceived defect or flaw in appearance in body dysmorphic disorder). There has been lot of debates and discussion if trichotillomania is an impulse control disorder, obsessive–compulsive spectrum disorder, or should be classified as a category of body-focused repetitive behavioral disorder.[3] Trichotillomania (hair pulling disorder) has been moved to obsessive–compulsive and related disorders in DSM 5; however, in International Classification of Diseases-10, it is classified under habit and impulse control disorders.[4] Lifetime prevalence rates of trichotillomania have been estimated to vary from 0.6% to 3.6%. Trichotillomania often begins or is recognized in late childhood or early adolescence with an average age of onset around 13 years and displays a chronic but fluctuating course.[5] It involves an individual recurrently pulling hair, generally one hair at a time from any part of his/her body, the head, eyelashes, eyebrows, beard, genital area, underarms, chest, legs, or other area. The scalp is the most common area. Pulling typically is done with the fingers, but tools such as tweezers, brushes, or combs may also be used.[6] Trichotillomania is associated with a significant functional impairment and psychiatric comorbidity across the developmental spectrum. As trichotillomania usually strikes during the sensitive developmental years, it can be especially disabling. Young adults with trichotillomania report impaired school, work, and social functioning, lowered career aspirations, and missed work days. Pulling can also negatively impact family functioning, contributing to family arguments, and secrecy, which in turn can increase stress and exacerbate trichotillomania symptoms. Adults also report that spending considerable financial resources on concealment methods and on treatments.[7] POINT OF VIEW The majority of literature and definitions focus on the act of pulling the hair, the preceding tension, and the relief of anxiety following the act. A variety of factors such as a sensation of itch, boredom, mood changes, stress, and negative emotions serve as triggers to pull the hairs.[8] Pre- and post-pulling activities are documented in literature but are mentioned just as activities surrounding the hair pulling. They receive little or no attention in the whole diagnosis, understanding and management of the disorder. There are lack of satisfactory explanations provided for majority of the postpulling activities and behaviors. An article by Woods and Houghton[5] mentions \"Rituals and behavioral patterns often precede pulling, such as combing through the hair, feeling individual hairs, tugging at hairs, and visually searching the scalp and the hairline. Pre- and post-pulling behavior are also clinically relevant. Although some individuals simply discard pulled hairs, others may play with the hair between their fingers, inspect the hair, bite the hair between the teeth, or ingest all or parts of the hair\". Activities surrounding the hair pulling provide pleasure to the persons with trichotillomania which probably acts a positive reinforcement to pull the hair. The pleasure may come through various sensory modalities which may vary from person to person. If hair pulling is only the primary goal, the patients should just pull the hair one by one and throw which hardly happens. They are involved in varied activities seeking pleasure involving all the sense organs which may vary from person to person. Antecedent activities such as feeling the texture of the hair, twirling, curling, grooming, combing, desire to have an even hairline, identifying the right hair, and then, the particular hair is pulled, all involve the touch sensation. The pulled hair is actually visualized for its characteristics such as length and color which involves the visual modality. The hairs are rubbed against each other, the snap pulling sound involves the hearing modality; at times, patients do even smell the hairs mixed with sweat to experience pleasure (Olfaction). Swallowing, tasting, the whole hair or a part of the hair is widely reported in literature which may be a way of experiencing the hair or else why should a person interested in only pulling the hairs swallow it. Oral behavior using pulled hair is present in half the patients and 5%–18% ingest their hair.[9] Trichophagia is a condition where persons swallow hair. Few patients swallow only the root of the hair called trichorhizophagia. Trichobezoar is a condition wherein swallowed hair starts accumulating in the stomach over a period to form a concretion which presents later with features of malnutrition and intestinal obstruction.[10] In a study by Grant et al.,[11] the rate of trichophagia in 68 individuals with DSM-IV-TR trichotillomania was approximately 1 in 5 (20.6%). CONCLUSION All the sense organs are involved in the varied pre-/post-pulling activities which vary from person to person and serve to maintain the behavior by reinforcements. It is also possible that in a subset of people, the pleasure-providing behaviors are these surrounding acts and hair pulling is just the modality of fulfilling it. Our diagnostic guidelines focus only on the hair pulling act. The behaviors surrounding the hair pulling problem will further help in the psychological management and also bring new insights into this poorly understood illness.",

Starting with the incidence of each symptom in the palliative medicine population, moving into physiology, pathogenesis, and discusses the assessment and management options. Sensory nerves from larynx, pharynx, and upper respiratory tract join the vagus nerve, and then enter the nerves system near the respiratory center, terminating in the medullary cough center. The efferent part of the reflex arc is a cholinergic pathway going to the effectors, located on pharyngeal and respiratory muscles. The ineffectiveness of the cough reflex may occur when respiratory and laryngeal muscles are weakened or uncoordinated, decreasing the driving pressure, which will result in a low expiratory volume and flows during cough. The accumulation of secretions within the respiratory tract of a patient around the later stages of a terminal disease can become a burden for the patient and the caregiver(s); it is also known as \"death rattle\" due to its association with imminent death.",

They both occurred during administration of phenothiazine tranquilizing drugs, and were relieved by changing or stopping the drug and by adding an anti-Parkinson drug. No attempt was made to determine the necessity for adding the anti-Parkinson drug when the tranquilizer was changed, though Kruse(4) reports that \"these reactions . . . were always controllable\" by anti-Parkinson drugs alone. 3. Akathisia is a syndrome which occurs during the administration of high doses of tranquilizing drugs. Whenever a patient fails to respond to the administration of high doses of these medicines or when he seems to have a paradoxical effect from them, the possibility of akathisia should be considered and appropriate treatment instituted. 4. Appropriate treatment of the condition appears to be, at this time, a reduction or change in the tranquilizing drugs used, plus the addition of an anti-Parkinson drug such as Cogentin, Pagitane, or Kemadrin.",

Serious cardiotoxicity can lead to ventricular dysrhythmia and a classic TCA electrocardiogram. Gluteal myonecrosis is reported in postoperative alcoholic states, unconscious conditions where patients remain in one position over a long period of time, strenuous physical training, or in crushing injuries. We report a case of gluteal myonecrosis after treatment with several drugs including TCA resulted in intoxication. The patient was mentally drowsy and had been lying down for 20 hours upon discovery. The patient presented on arrival to the ER with cardiotoxicity secondary to TCA intoxication and was treated. Two weeks following the incident, she complained of pain in the gluteal area. Subsequent management and investigation revealed that her gluteal myonecrosis was a result of delayed complication from a prolonged recumbent position and hemolysis due to drug interactions. She eventually recovered without the need for surgery (fasciotomy).",

O diagnóstico é baseado na ocorrência de duas crises ou na probabilidade de crises futuras, considerando fatores como crises noturnas e alterações no eletroencefalograma. Crises epilépticas podem ser confundidas com outras condições neurológicas e psiquiátricas, como síncope, crises psicogênicas, enxaqueca e narcolepsia. A síncope, uma perda temporária de consciência devido à hipoperfusão cerebral, é diferenciada das crises epilépticas pela ausência de tônus muscular e rápida recuperação. Crises psicogênicas, associadas a fatores psicológicos, têm uma duração mais longa e uma recuperação rápida. Enxaquecas compartilham fases semelhantes às crises epilépticas, mas com sintomas que evoluem gradualmente. A narcolepsia é caracterizada por sonolência diurna e cataplexia, sendo diferenciada pela ausência de alterações epilépticas no eletroencefalograma. A diferenciação adequada entre essas condições é crucial para um diagnóstico preciso e tratamento efetivo, evitando abordagens inadequadas e melhorando a qualidade de vida do paciente.",

It is not uncommon to occur co-morbidly between narcolepsy and psychiatric disorders. This association is poorly understood. Recent findings indicate that anxiety disorders also are associated with typical symptoms of narcolepsy. Objectives Study of the comorbidity between narcolepsy and psychiatric disorders, like anxiety, through a clinical case. Methods A 21-year-old female patient with no psychiatric history who consulted due to anxiety and panic attacks related to poor narcolepsy control. Debut of the neurological disease during adolescence with frequent cataplexy attacks that condition their daily activity and generate avoidance behaviors and agoraphobia. Results The patient complained of poor quality of sleep and reported a large number of different types of situations (eg, surprise, embarrassment) associated with cataplectic events. Treatment with SSRIs first and bupropion with pregabalin later was partially effective. Recent studies suggest efficacy of vagus nerve stimulation. Conclusions Anxiety disorders, especially panic attacks and social phobias, often affect patients with narcolepsy. Anxiety and mood symptoms could be secondary complications of the chronic symptoms of narcolepsy. Recent studies have shown that narcolepsy is caused by defective hypocretin signaling. As hypocretin neurotransmission is also involved in stress regulation and addiction, this raises the possibility that mood and anxiety symptoms are primary disease phenomena in narcolepsy. Recent studies suggest that vagus nerve stimulation could be potentially useful in the treatment of resistant depressive and anxiety disorder and it is not a contraindication in patients with narcolepsy.

Different substances can be classified based on their effects on the central nervous system. These effects vary depending on the substance and can produce everything from increased energy and euphoria to profound sedation. In general, while the effects vary significantly, the initial stages of substance use disorders are characterized by positive reinforcement, where individuals experience a sense of well-being or euphoria with use.

      "abstract": "A esclerose múltipla remitente-recorrente (EMRR) é uma doença neurológica autoimune, onde o sistema imunológico ataca a bainha de mielina do sistema nervoso central, causando inflamação que prejudica a transmissão dos impulsos nervosos. Caracteriza-se por episódios de surtos com exacerbação dos sintomas, como fadiga, fraqueza em membros inferiores e superiores, tremores e equilíbrio dificuldade para andar, perda de visão, entre outros, seguidos de remissões com recuperação parcial ou completa, que podem durar meses ou anos, durante os quais a progressão da doença é mínima ou ausente. A insônia ou baixa qualidade de sono pode ocorrer indiretamente como consequência da EMRR. Ou seja, um sintoma secundário que é acarretado pela presença dos sintomas específicos da doença e dos pseudo surtos. A Percepção Corporal (PC) pode ser definida de duas maneiras, como Imagem Corporal (IC) e Esquema Corporal (EC). A IC está relacionada ao aspecto psíquico, emocional, cognitivo, sociocultural, evolucionário, genético e neurocientífico, em relação a expectativa da imagem de seu corpo. O EC é a perspectiva que possibilita, por meio de mecanismos cinestésicos e proprioceptivos, o reconhecimento do corpo anatômico e da relação que este estabelece com o meio e com os objetos a sua volta. Diante destas definições, surgiu a oportunidade para relacionar a qualidade de sono com a percepção corporal e os quadros sintomatológicos. Sendo assim, o objetivo do estudo foi analisar a relação entre a qualidade do sono e a percepção corporal, pelo aspecto do esquema corporal e os quadros sintomatológicos da esclerose múltipla. Participaram 18 pessoas, entre 21 e 67 anos, que foram avaliados quanto à qualidade do sono pelo questionário de Pittsburgh, à percepção corporal pelo Teste de Askevold, e aos sintomas por meio de uma entrevista estruturada. Os resultados indicaram que todos os participantes com sono adequado foram classificados como hiperesquemáticos, enquanto 67% dos que apresentaram sono inadequado foram classificados como hipoesquemáticos. Além disso, indivíduos com sono inadequado mostraram uma distribuição equilibrada entre sintomas motores e sensitivos, enquanto aqueles com sono adequado relataram predominantemente sintomas sensitivos. A fadiga foi um sintoma relevante em 67% dos indivíduos com sono inadequado. Esses achados sugerem que a qualidade do sono pode estar associada à percepção corporal e à manifestação dos sintomas na EMRR, destacando a importância de intervenções que melhorem o sono para o manejo dessa condição.",

This review describes the clinical characteristics of PD with emphasis on those features that differentiate the disease from other parkinsonian disorders.A MedLine search was performed to identify studies that assess the clinical characteristics of PD. Search terms included \"Parkinson's disease\", \"diagnosis\" and \"signs and symptoms\".Because there is no definitive test for the diagnosis of PD, the disease must be diagnosed based on clinical criteria. Rest tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity and loss of postural reflexes are generally considered the cardinal signs of PD. The presence and specific presentation of these features are used to differentiate PD from related parkinsonian disorders. Other clinical features include secondary motor symptoms (eg, hypomimia, dysarthria, dysphagia, sialorrhoea, micrographia, shuffling gait, festination, freezing, dystonia, glabellar reflexes), non-motor symptoms (eg, autonomic dysfunction, cognitive/neurobehavioral abnormalities, sleep disorders and sensory abnormalities such as anosmia, paresthesias and pain). Absence of rest tremor, early occurrence of gait difficulty, postural instability, dementia, hallucinations, and the presence of dysautonomia, ophthalmoparesis, ataxia and other atypical features, coupled with poor or no response to levodopa, suggest diagnoses other than PD.A thorough understanding of the broad spectrum of clinical manifestations of PD is essential to the proper diagnosis of the disease. Genetic mutations or variants, neuroimaging abnormalities and other tests are potential biomarkers that may improve diagnosis and allow the identification of persons at risk.",

We describe an unusual form of palinacousis resulting from acute lobar intracerebral hemorrhage.A 70-year-old right-handed white man with history of hypertension, ischemic cardiomyopathy, and atrial fibrillation on anticoagulation developed a rare form of palinacousis, on which he hears the previous speaker's voice on the current speaker's speech due to right parietal intracranial hemorrhage. Cranial imaging revealed right parietal intracranial hemorrhage likely secondary to cerebral amyloid angiopathy or hypertension. Extensive workup and thorough clinical examination ruled out dementia, psychosis, seizure, or other behavioral disorders. The condition gradually improved without any specific intervention.Abnormality in auditory processing due to intracranial lesions affecting auditory cortical projections causes a variety of symptoms that mimic other conditions such as psychotic hallucinations, and ictal and postictal behavioral changes. Thorough characterization with detailed examination and workup may help in distinguishing one from the other. A rare form of palinacousis may occur after unilateral nondominant parietal lesion. The condition is self-limiting and requires no specific management. Ruling out seizure disorder or psychiatric condition may prevent unnecessary workup and treatment.",

      "abstract": "Neonatal seizure is the most prominent neurological dysfunction in the neonatal period which constitutes a medical emergency. Seizures result from excessive depolarization of neurons within the nervous system. Tonic, clonic, subtle and myoclonic are the different forms of neonatal seizure. Among the causes hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy is the commonest. Jitteriness and benign neonatal sleep myoclonus should be differentiated from the neonatal seizure. Proper history taking and meticulous examination should aimed to identify the seizure and find out the aetiology. Important investigations include blood sugar, serum electrolytes (Na, Ca, Mg), arterial blood gas, anion gap, cerebrospinal fluid examination, ultrasound examination of the head and electroencephalography. Upon identification of common metabolic derangements like hypoglycaemia, hypocalcaemia, hypomagnesemia, they are treated as per recommended protocol. The rest of the symptomatic seizures (nonmetabolic) are treated with phenobarbitone. If seizures failed to respond or recur after Phenobarbitone therapy, Phenytoin, Midozolam are the subsequent options. As the recurrence rate is relatively small and the potential toxicities are high on developing brain, the good practice is to stop anticonvulsant as early as possible. Neonatal seizures have an adverse effect on neurodevelopmental outcome and predispose to cognitive, behavioral, or epileptic complications in later life.

      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common and underestimated sleep disorder of breathing affecting about 4% and 2% of middle-aged males and females respectively and its prevalence increases with age. This disease is characterized by repeated total (apnea) or partial (hypopnea) closure of upper airways when asleep. There are repeated sequences of events associated with hypoxemia and - often unconscious - arousals. As a consequence, the following conditions occur: disordered sleep phases and sleep architecture, excessive daytime sleepiness and fatigue, headaches, impairment of cognitive processes, touchiness and emotional see-saw or even changes in personality. One of serious consequences of OSA are cardiovascular complications, such as arterial hypertension, coronary artery disease, arrhythmia (with increased hazard of sudden death), heart failure, increased hazard of strokes. The consequences of OSA include also psychiatric and psychological problems - depression, anxiety neurosis, sexual disorders and well as vascular dementia. Significant effect of untreated disease on the emotional state, cognitive functions and uncontrollable daytime sleepiness result in serious social consequences for labour market, pension system, social insurance, morbidity, mortality, treatment costs, other costs and foregone earnings. Although patients are most often unconscious of their disorder, OSA affects their everyday functioning in the society through increased risk of accidents at work and traffic crashes. Studies indicate, that percentage of traffic crashes among drivers with sleep apnea is 2-7 fold higher as compared to drivers who do not suffer from that disorder. Significant health-related impact and socioeconomic aspects of sleep disordered breathing argues for urgent need for earlier disease identification and management to reduce these consequences.",

      "title": "Commentary on Song <i>et al</i>: Brain stimulation for addictions‐ optimizing impact via strategic interleaving with pharmacotherapy, cognitive behavioral therapy, and restructuring the micro‐environment",
      "abstract": "Song and colleagues[1] may be helping us to finally answer basic questions about efficacy of brain stimulation methods and move toward equally pressing questions as to how we can obtain optimal synergies between brain stimulation methods and other modalities, including the restructuring of the microenvironment. How does one go about strategically combining brain stimulation with pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy and other addictions treatment modalities? Issues related to risks and benefits, optimum timing and parameter selection of brain stimulation in relation to medical and psychosocial addiction intervention need to be considered carefully. Some psychotropic medications used in the context of addiction can lower the seizure threshold, and while this does not seem to add major risk of seizures when rTMS is used to treat depression [2], the risk of seizure might increase in the context of acute toxicity or withdrawal from substances of abuse [3]. On the other hand, some psychotropics used to manage addiction (e.g. benzodiazepine) can reduce efficacy of brain stimulation by interfering with the underlying mechanism of treatment [4]. Increasingly there are attempts to integrate rTMS with cognitive behavioral therapy. Indeed this happens incidentally in clinical practice on a routine basis, by virtue of the fact that many individuals undergoing brain stimulation treatment are also receiving ongoing psychotherapeutic intervention, either in group or individual format. What is largely missing is the strategic timing of sessions and phases of therapy with stimulation such as to maximize their impact. For instance, early in CBT treatment it might be important to bolster brain networks supporting self-regulatory processes in craving control, long enough for the individual to gain a foothold and benefit from the skills offered for craving control by the therapist. Likewise, an argument could be made that stimulation sessions should be timed such that peak benefit coincides with the most taxing phase of therapy, wherein self-regulation of emotional responses is especially important; in the case of cue exposure sessions, this might mean that stimulation should reach its maximum impact before exposure is attempted. The same logic could support timing the sessions so that maximum benefit is received before reintegration back into a risky environment, following release from an inpatient treatment program. The primary point is that strategic interleaving of rTMS and psychotherapeutic intervention seems to be potentially very important, and yet we know very little about it. Only careful empirical research can inform questions about optimal timing of stimulation in relation to psychotherapeutic interventions like CBT. Finally, an important future avenue for intervention is pairing brain stimulation with strategic changes in the micro-environment (i.e., the context in which the craving object is routinely encountered in everyday life). Using the example of eating, we have found that indulgent food consumption is jointly impacted by both stimulation type and the nature of cues in the eating environment [5]. Engineering the micro-environment to reduce cued cravings may optimize the impact of strengthening of brain networks using brain stimulation methods. Beyond this, the wider macro-environment supporting or mitigating indulgence of various types is the province of public health, meaning that multi-level interventions—from brain to society—may be critical for managing addictions of all types. Ultimately, brain stimulation research and public health research may be mutually reinforcing.

      "title": "Terminal sedation, euthanasia, and causal roles.",
      "abstract": "When terminal sedation is made the object of bioethical discussion, it is mostly in a way that a literary critic might call synecdochal: A part is taken for the whole. What is made the object of discussion is a whole of which terminal sedation is only a part. Not unlike discussions of prenatal diagnosis or preimplantation diagnosis, it is only the combination with other medical behaviors that creates ethical problems. In the case of terminal sedation, it is the combination with the termination of some nonpalliative medical treatment. Only in this combination does terminal sedation become a form of euthanasia.\r\n\r\nIf one takes for granted the standard definition of terminal sedation, this medical procedure cannot by itself be considered to constitute an act of euthanasia. By this definition, terminal sedation is a treatment administered when other palliative treatments are not sufficiently effective, and which aims at keeping a severely suffering patient unconscious in the proximity of death. Relevant indications are agitation, fear of suffocating, vomiting, sleeplessness, and states of severe pain. According to this definition, the adjective “terminal” refers to nothing but the temporal incidence of sedation and leaves open the causal relation between sedation and subsequent death. It does not prejudge the issue of whether sedation stands in any causal relation to the patient's death. As a rule, it is assumed to have no causal role in this death; it makes it easier for the patient to live his last period of life, but does not causally contribute to death. It constitutes help in dying and not help to die.\r\n\r\nWhat is more controversial is the classification and evaluation of combinations of terminal sedation with the termination of other medical treatments, either preceding or following sedation.[1] This combination has been increasingly applied in medical practice, especially in The Netherlands, the country about whose practice we are best informed. In The Netherlands, terminal sedation has been increasingly used as an alternative to active euthanasia. The most recent Dutch survey, which for the first time includes information about terminal sedation, shows that in 2001 terminal sedation was given in 5.6% of all deaths. It also shows that in almost two thirds of these cases artificial nutrition and hydration were simultaneously withdrawn.[2] This combination of terminal sedation and termination of treatment, understood as the termination of some or all life-sustaining nonpalliative measures, will be the focus of discussion.",

Objectives To describe a case report of a 20-year-old man, in outpatient psychiatric follow-up, after debuting at age 18 with a severe depressive episode of endogenomorphic characteristics without psychotic symptoms, with subsequent complete remission. Two years after clinical stability, he required prolonged hospitalization due to polymorphous psychotic syndrome of abrupt onset in a context of previous continuous use of cannabis and cocaine. Suspicion towards parents, bizarre behaviors, rushing desires, unmotivated laughter, fixed gaze, bewilderment, anguish with a feeling of imminent death, alternates with euphoria and senseless purchases. Methods We present the case report of this patient with a mental examination of conscious, scattered attention with marked distractibility, confusion and experiences of strangeness, memory gaps, subjective sensation of well-being with tachypsychia, which fluctuates with thymic oscillations and alternates with episodes of marked indefinite anguish, intense anxiety with delusional fear of the death of him or his family. Little systematized ideas of reference and prejudice based on intuitions or delusional occurrences in their environment. Megalomaniac and religious-messianic ideation. No sensory perception disturbances. Disintegrated course of thought, with frequent illogical associations, ambivalence of thought, affectivity and psychomotricity. Motor restlessness and behavioral disorganization. Global insomnia. Judgment of reality and superior functions diminished. No auto/heteroaggressiveness. Results Various psychoactive drugs were tested for two months, obtaining a response only with valproic acid 1500mg, pregabalin 450mg and olanzapine 15mg, presenting slow improvement in a situation of absence of consumption, with a predominance of symptomatic polymorphism, decreasing fluctuation between episodes of expansiveness and psychotic anguish, remitting disorganization and motility alterations, persisting poor awareness of the disease and cognitive complaints. He was referred for follow-up at the mental health center where his gradual recovery continued. A differential diagnosis of polymorphous psychosis is proposed, compatible with a cycloid psychosis of the anxiety-happiness type with marked affective symptoms, precipitated by substance use. Conclusions Cycloid anxiety-happiness psychosis stands out for intense and fluctuating anxiety, oscillating with feelings of happiness, ecstasy, and placidity, mystical-religious delusions, and preoccupation with death, which may comprise a different psychotic debut.

      "title": "F1‐01‐02: Tackling overlap of neuropsychiatric symptoms in Alzheimer's and other dementias: Toward a unified approach to evaluation and treatment",
      "abstract": "Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS), while nearly universal in AD, tend to occur in phenotypic clusters, which may reflect distinct pathophysiologies arising from specific underlying brain damage. Therefore, treatments targeting their specific cause(s) are required. For example, symptom clusters (“syndromes”) characterized as affective, psychotic, agitated, apathetic, or reflecting sleep-wake cycle disorders have been proposed. Individual symptoms may co-occur in more than one syndrome at a given time, and these relationships may differ across the MCI to severe AD spectrum. Adding to the complexity, many NPS are thought to be the short-term result of environmental provocations (reactive psychological states and behaviors) which partly arise from non-specific effects of brain damage. For example, striking out during caregiving, acute nocturnal confusion, and excessively loud vocalization when confronted by cognitive limitations might be understood as the result of unsophisticated caregiving, acute delirium, or catastrophic reaction. The above issues have hampered the NPS field's ability to agree on how to evaluate, differentiate, and treat NPS. Gaining consensus on a common algorithmic approach to evaluation, differentiation, and how and when to initiate non-pharmacologic psychosocial treatments, would lay solid foundation for tackling NPS in the clinical world, and inform research in developing new therapies. We present an Expert Consensus Panel's proposed unified algorithm for the assessment, differentiation, and treatment of NPS in AD. Three talks are envisioned, followed by a panel discussion. The first talk uses epidemiologic findings from several international studies to define the challenge posed by NPS overlap, varying etiologies, and differences by AD stage, and lays the conceptual background for the proposed algorithm. The second talk expands the Four “D's” systematic approach to evaluation and differentiation (Rabins, Lyketsos, and Steele, 1999) that allows clinicians and researchers to develop patient specific interventions. The final talk presents evidence supporting the use of psychosocial interventions for NPS linked to the outcomes of the “4D” method, and discusses both specific and non-specific psychosocial approaches to the management of individual NPS syndromes. The latter assumes that such well articulated psychosocial approaches must be used prior to medication treatments. The panel concludes with speaker and audience discussion moderated by the panel chair.",

      "abstract": "The weakening of the repression barrier that occurs in sleep and in other altered states of consciousness, such as free association during the process of psychoanalytic therapy, may be produced in a relatively simple fashion during transcendental meditation. An impressive aspect of this phenomenon is that, during the meditation, the intense emotional affect that would ordinarily accompany this ideation, e.g., when obtained by free association, seems to be markedly reduced or almost absent. During meditation, thoughts and ideas may appear that are ordinarily repressed, such as intense hostile-aggressive drives, murderous impulses, and, occasionally, libidinal ideation. Evaluation of electroencephalogram records in patients and subjects using the relaxation techniques reveals remarkable periods of intrahemispheric alpha and theta synchrony at times, even for inexperienced subjects. In a Transcendental Meditation meditator who has been meditating for more than 4 years, there occurs synchronous alpha activity upon closing the eyes, even before starting to meditate on the temporal, central, and occipital cortical areas.",

      "title": "Decrypting Sepsis-Associated Brain Dysfunction: A Computational Phenotype That Can Hack It*",
      "abstract": "In ancient Greece, fever accompanied by loss of the rational mind was termed \"phrenitis,\" an ominous condition with a high fatality rate. The etymology of phrenitis relates to inflammation, indicated by \"itis,\" and also references the diaphragm, or \"phren,\" which ancient Greeks' believed harbored intellect and emotion (1). Perhaps a reflection of the condition's mysterious underpinnings, which prevented supplanting by more precise nomenclature, phrenitis continued to be diagnosed by physicians until the 19th century, when it was eventually ousted by terms that persist to this day, including encephalitis, meningitis, and delirium (2). This obsolescence of phrenitis might be likened to cleaning out a garage and throwing out a broken bicycle, then replacing it with a new handlebar bell, a new handlebar basket, and another broken bicycle. Encephalitis and meningitis each have separate, standalone utility. Both are words that speak to logical, underlying mechanisms responsible for clinical manifestations. Infection-related delirium, on the other hand, is rooted in the word \"delirare,\" a term that meant \"to be out of one's furrow,\" which originated as a farming metaphor referring to a plow veering from its intended path (3). The word \"delirium\" is as connected to the biological basis of altered mental status as the diaphragm is to one's personality. The use of conceptual metaphors to label infection-related brain dysfunction represents a need to bridge a gap between a complex, poorly understood phenomenon and the general understanding required to develop durable management strategies. Bridging this gap is indeed important because the ambiguous biological basis of sepsis-related brain dysfunction is juxtaposed with the sharply defined adverse outcomes associated with its development. Approximately 20% of children with sepsis or septic shock experience some form of associated brain dysfunction (4). Among one large cohort of children with septic shock, any acute pathologic neurologic sign or event was significantly associated with death or a clinically substantial deterioration in quality of life 3 months later (5). However, varied names and definitions for sepsis-associated brain dysfunction complicate efforts to identify optimal treatment approaches. As Alcamo et al (6) note in this issue of Pediatric Critical Care Medicine, brain involvement in sepsis and septic shock \"…goes by a variety of terms including sepsis-associated encephalopathy, sepsis-induced brain dysfunction, or sepsis-associated delirium…\" Accordingly, a validated, well-performing definition applicable to electronic health records (EHRs) is needed to aid surveillance efforts and epidemiological assessments, with the ultimate intent of improving outcomes. This is not a new undertaking for Alcamo et al (6), who have spent years developing and validating a structured, composite, \"computational phenotype of acute brain dysfunction (CPABD).\" Akin to other epidemiological breakthroughs, like the simple questionnaires used to link smoking with lung cancer in the 1950s, CPABD is constructed with a straightforward methodology that belies its broad utility (7). Using structured data ubiquitous in modern EHR databases, CPABD assesses whether a patient had MRI or CT brain imaging, an electroencephalogram (EEG), or was treated with an antipsychotic medication during an inpatient encounter. Initially developed and assessed in solid organ transplant recipients, CPABD proved useful in that population to reproduce, on a greater scale, an association between higher tacrolimus levels and neurologic morbidities (8). Subsequently, CPABD was applied to a retrospective population of children with sepsis, and content, criterion, and construct validity were confirmed through thorough evaluation (9). CPABD has also been astutely tethered to informatics best practices in previous work, poising it for use in massive, harmonized, multicenter collections of EHR data that are now being assembled through efforts such as the National Institute of Health's Bridge 2 Artificial Intelligence (10). To further establish the soundness of CPABD, Alcamo et al (6) compare it to other definitions of sepsis-related neurologic dysfunction, including those created by Proulx et al (11), the International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus Conference (IPSCC) (12), and the Pediatric Organ Dysfunction Information Update Mandate (PODIUM) (13). Proulx et al (11) put forward the most severe definition of sepsis-related brain dysfunction, requiring pupils to be fixed and dilated or a total Glasgow Coma Scale score (GCS) less than 5. IPSCC requires an acute change in mental status and a total GCS less than or equal to 11 or a change in mental status accompanied by a drop in GCS of at least 3 points. The recently introduced PODIUM definition includes any of the four following findings: 1) an EEG with seizure attenuation or suppressed activity, 2) acute injury, 3) a total GCS less than or equal to 8, or a GCS motor score less than or equal to 4, 4) a Cornell assessment of pediatric delirium score greater than or equal to 9. The assessment measures used to compare the definitions of brain dysfunction are those guided by the Standards for Reporting Diagnostic Accuracy (STARD) guidelines (14). These include the familiar measures of sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value (NPV), and positive predictive value (PPV). A few more esoteric measures are also reported, including pretest and posttest probability, false discovery rate, false omission rate, and prevalence threshold. Pretest probability is measured as the prevalence of adjudicated brain dysfunction identified through chart review labeled according to an a priori established reference standard. Posttest probability is calculated by multiplying the positive likelihood ratio, determined using sensitivity and specificity, with pretest probability. The false discovery rate is calculated as 1-PPV, which is the same as the ratio of false positives to all positive cases and translates to labeling an encounter as having acute brain dysfunction when it does not meet the reference standard. The false omission rate is 1-NPV, or the ratio of false negatives to all negatives, and translates to missing a case of acute brain dysfunction when the reference standard was met. The prevalence threshold is the prevalence at which PPV drops most precipitously. CPABD outperforms the other acute brain dysfunction definitions across all measures. Sensitivity is 0.83, specificity is 0.93, PPV 0.84, and NPV 0.93. The prevalence threshold is 0.22, which is close to the actual population prevalence of 0.3 determined using the reference standard definition. The CPABD posttest probability of 0.84 is substantially higher than all the other definitions, which range from 0.39 (IPSCC) to 0.57 (Proulx et al [11]). Collectively, these characteristics add further support to the use of CPABD as a reliable, well-performing definition that can be applied to modern data collections. As the authors appropriately note, the narrower definitions relying heavily on GCS are more prone to misclassification and ascertainment biases, a finding likely rooted in the original construct of the GCS. GCS was developed empirically to standardize assessments of altered consciousness in the setting of trauma and brain surgery. Since then, GCS has burrowed its way into other domains of critical illness largely driven by clinician familiarity with the tool, a natural tendency to move things that work in one space to other proximate arenas, and the score's relative elegance compared with more comprehensive neurologic assessments. In contrast, the performance strengths of CPABD appear to stem from its reliance on clinical action rather than patient assessment. For CPABD, clinicians are the ultimate arbiter of determining acute brain dysfunction, a feature that arguably bolsters the tool's performance; however, it must also be noted that the reference standard used in the assessment was defined by \"clinical experts\" (the authors themselves) and therefore may have catered, both intentionally and inadvertently, to the computational phenotype. This is especially relevant given the recent, milestone release of the international Phoenix consensus criteria for sepsis in children, which defines sepsis-related neurologic dysfunction as a GCS less than or equal to 10 (1 point) or fixed pupils bilaterally (2 points) and is not accounted for by Alcamo et al (6) and Schlapbach et al (15) Instead, the reference standard in the present work encompasses much milder phenotypes of brain dysfunction, including \"headache not relieved by fluid resuscitation\" and \"agitation\" to name only 2 of the approximately 11 clinical scenarios described by the authors. How this decision will influence the use of CPABD as the world decides how to use the new Phoenix criteria remains to be determined, though the reference standard devised by Alcamo et al (6) might be interpreted as at least one collective voice claiming that brain dysfunction compatible with sepsis occurs well before a patient becomes stuporous, comatose, or develops two nonreactive pupils. We are no longer entering into an era of \"big data\" in medicine but are now solidly within the boundaries of this widely touted epoch of time. As mortality rates for pediatric sepsis continue to decline in the developed world, thanks in part to robust quality improvement initiatives also propelled by modern information systems, developing new breakthroughs that preserve the neurodevelopmental potential of critically ill children feels less dramatically ambitious and more realistically achievable in the coming years. Characterizing the scale of sepsis-related acute brain dysfunction is a necessary, fundamental step to deploy new treatments and interventions to help prevent both acute and long-lasting consequences of critical illness. Although the brain remains the body's most enigmatic organ, we have learned far more about it in the past 2 millennia than our current nomenclature for its afflictions might suggest. \"Big data\" tools like CPABD can be expected to help us hone in on meaningful patterns of illness that will lead to a better understanding of specific mechanisms and pathways underlying the varied reasons a plow might deviate from the furrow.",

These symptoms reflect the dysfunction of the enteric nervous system, and the stomach is one of the organs where alpha-synuclein is first deposited. Other factors, such as the dysfunction of structures in the central nervous system like the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagal nerve, hormonal factors or secondary effects deriving from the consumption of antiparkinsonian drugs, are involved in its origin.

      "title": "ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE DIFFERENT FORMS OF INSANITY",
      "abstract": "THE cases of melancholia narrated in the former papers have exihibited-1. Alterations or lesions of the moral faculties as a morbid degree of depression, grief, anxiety, fear, etc.; 2. Alteration or lesion of the psychical or intellectual faculties, as false per ceptions, false conceptions, illusions, delusions, etc.; and 3. Alterations in miiotility; but, so far as we have yet gone, only an excessive motion or restlessness has been illustrated. There are cases in which the pro minent feature is a lesion of motility, but which con sists in an indispositioni t-o move-in torpor of rmove ment. Cases of this kind are next to be detailed. Bearing in mnind that the lesion of the moral faculty appears to be, as it were, the starting point or ground work of the disease, it would appear that cases are to be met with in which the whole of the phenomena seem to be confined to this division of the mental faculties, while in other cases this groundwork is in volved with one, or chiefly with one, of the other sub divisions. On the one hand, we m-neet with cases in .which the motility is scarcely affected; or, on the other hand, we findl cases in which the psychical func tions appear but very partially implicated. It is a common cause of surprise to the friends of melan cholic patients that the melancholic talks or writes quite rationally or coherently; that he is quite cor rect in memory; or that he argues as acutely as ever. When, however, there is torpid condition of the mo tility, the patient, though he often retains his intel lectual powers nearly intact, bears the expression of the lowest degree of dementia; the features are dull and heavy. The Frenlch call this form mnelancolie avec stupeur. Tphe next case is of this kind, and the intellect proper -was only partially implicated. CASE ix. A. K., aged 34, married, wife of a butler, was formerly a lady's maid. She lived, previously to her marriage, eleven years in one place, anAd married the butler. This appears to have been an unfortunate match. The famnily miiade frequent inquiries about the patient. The husband has taken very little interest abouat her. He attributed her disease to stubborn ness; and recluested by letter that she imiight be treated with firmness anid well routed. The medli cal cerltificate accompaiving the order of admission gave tlae following description of the patient just prior to her reception:- She sits weeping and miserable; says she has broken her husband's heart; that shle is better without food. Her landlord and fellow-lodgers found her in a state of comiiplete ex hauistion fromii wvant of food. The clhildren also ap peared half-famiished. She declares she heard voices forbidd!inu her to eat or cdrink, or light fire, or go to becl. In this hearing of voices there was evidence of dis tinct intellectual or ply,ychical disturbance. It never, however, manifested itself afterwards. On aclmission (Oct. 21st, date of disease uncertain), she conversed quietly and correctly, though in a weak tone of voice. She said slhe had been living in London with her children in a lodging. She had no headache. The tongue was much furred. The bowels were con lined. She took beef-tea only for dinner. She had no thirst. Pulse 60, feeble. There was no cough, nor any morbid chest-signs. She was ordered full diet, one eog, and two glasses of wine daily. Oct. 24th. Sho was up; was pale, but had consi derable turgescence of the vessels of the conjunctiva. The tongue was red; bowels not open. An aloetic draught twice a day was ordered. It will be sufficient to describe the progress of the case by entries taken at the different epochs. During the first three months, she continued constantly de pressed; was always more or less indisposed to exert herself; would not dress herself. She declinecl in strength, but made no complaint. During my temu porary absence from home, her head was shaved and blistered without apparent benefit. The bowels con tinued obstinate; but she would seldom take an aperient; and she occasionally refused food. Jan. 8th (three months after admission). She varied from day to day. One day she refused all food, and said she did not require it; that she could do without it. Another day she ate ravenously. The bowels seldom acted. She refuised medicine. She emaciated visibly. Pulse 70, regular. There were no cough nor chest-symptoms. She was always listless and depressed. The expression of the features was dull and heavy. Jan. 13th. Her mind was in the same state; but she ate ravenously. She would gorge herself if not watched; she filched the meat from the other patients' plates. Jan. 0Oth. She again refused food. She sat moodily in one position for lolng periods. Her features were dull and expressionless. She allowed the nasal secre tion and saliva to dribble from her as she sat. Feb. 10th (fotur months after admission). Motility was still more involved. She sat for lonog periods in one posture, apparently indifferent to all around, aand too lazy to move. She was like a statue in immobility; but the attitude was expressive of hebetude. She hung her head; the features were relaxed, and did not change; her arms dangled by the side of the chair as she sat. The secretions were dropping from the mouth and nose, and the lacrymnal secretion had dried upon her cheek. The breathing was slightly acceler ated. Her bowels were confined. She was at the pre sent date eating largely. Three grains of podophyllin were ordered. Feb. 26th. She was moving down the gallery at a snail's pace. Her head was drooping, and her arnms hanging heavily by her side. Her dress was neglected. She had not menstruated since admiiission. Compounlld iron mixture was ordered. March 2nd. She would not take the medicine; was still more dull and heavy. She stood about in one positioni, obstructing the passage, and did not moive to allow olne to pass. She appeared motionless and statue-like. Her arm-s and head drooped. The saliva and nasal secretion dribbled from her. She dropped her fIeces about, and wet herself as she stood. She never attempted to dress or wash herself. The pulse was 60; te circulation appeared torpid; the nose and lips were purplish; the hands cold anid puffy. At times she would eat, and at times refuLsed food for days together; she had, however, gained flesh. March 9th. She asked voluntarily for some paper, and sat down and wrote a letter to her sister, request ingf her to send her some needlework. The letter was correctly worded and spelt; bnt rather less neatly written towards the close; and it was without signa ture. Great improvement in the appearance of the pa tient took place from this date, and increased. The work was sent, and she took to it at once. 163rd day (or five months). Her expression was greatly improved. She was now quite animated. The 33",

      "title": "Syncope and Hypoglycemia",
      "abstract": "Objective: This review focuses on syncope in diabetic patients who suffer from hypoglycemia. Clinically, transient loss of consciousness during hypoglycemia appears similar to vasovagal syncope. Research Design and Methods: Current understanding of this problem is based on physicians’ personal experiences as well as on published case reports. It is difficult to explain a temporary loss of consciousness as a result of hypoglycemia. Demonstration that hypoglycemia can be transient, with the patient suffering from neuroglycopenia without autonomic symptoms due to delayed counterregulation, might be a first step in confirming that a diabetic patient suffered from a transient loss of consciousness with spontaneous recovery. Results: Hypoglycemic syncope is uncommon, affecting 1.9% of diabetic patients using insulin therapy. It is characterized clinically by brief periods of unconsciousness with slow recovery and without loss of postural muscle tone. The difficulty in correlating loss of consciousness to hypoglycemia arises from mismatching symptoms, that is, there may be mental symptoms such as confusion, loss of memory or consciousness, in the absence of autonomic manifestations such as sweating or blurred vision. There are currently no established glucose values that define the level of hypoglycemia that causes loss of consciousness. Conclusion: Hypoglycemic syncope should be suspected in older diabetic patients with preserved postural tone, usually but not always using insulin therapy, who show a slow recovery from transient loss of consciousness with persisting neurological impairment and low blood glucose levels.",

      "title": "Prevalence and characterization of the insomnia syndrome in an outpatient oncology clinic",
      "abstract": "18612 Background: Insomnia is an often overlooked symptom. One potential reason for this neglect is that insomnia is viewed as a normal and temporary reaction to the cancer diagnosis or treatment. Patients themselves may fail to report their sleep difficulties to their physicians for similar reasons. Previous work in understanding insomnia has been limited by the lack of an operational definition of the insomnia syndrome, small sample size and varied instruments for symptom detection. Hence, the proportion of cancer patients meeting diagnostic criteria for the insomnia syndrome is not well known. Recently the diagnosis of the insomnia syndrome has been redefined using a combination of criteria derived from the International Classification of Sleep Disorders and the DSM-IV. The criteria includes)difficulty in initiating and/or maintaining sleep, whereby sleep-onset latency and/or wake after sleep onset is greater than 30 minutes; sleep efficiency (ratio of total sleep time to total time spent in bed) lower than 85%; difficulties occurring at least 3 nights per week; difficulties occurring for at least 6 months; and difficulties causing marked distress or significant impairment in daytime functioning (eg, fatigue, disturbed mood, performance deficits). Methods: 100 consecutive oncology patients were surveyed using the above criteria for the insomnia syndrome. Symptom assessment was also included. Results: The incidence of the insomnia syndrome seems to correspond to previously reported incidences.Patient have more problems staying asleep than going to sleep. Patients may have dramatic inversions of their sleep/wake cycle yet feel that they do not have insomnia. Pain is the most commonly associated symptom associated with insomnia. Conclusions: There is a great need for better tools to asssess the symptom of insomnia. Focusing on specific characteristics of insomnia and distinguishing the insomnia syndrome versus the symptom of insomnia is an effective way establish if there is a need for specific therapy. The addition of symptom assessment further improves the characterisation insomnia. Characteristics of insomnia experienced by the patient may help direct specific treatment modalities. Pain is a frequently associated symptom with insomnia. No significant financial relationships to disclose.",

Some behaviors, for some people, can have similar effects on the same DA reward circuitry resulting in very similar addictive behavior patterns and consequences. Although the term \"addictive\" has been used loosely with many behaviors, it may be an appropriate term to describe compulsive shopping. Increased accessibility, hyperstimulating marketing techniques, a loss of the protective delay between impulse and purchase, and overvaluing of the shopping process and objects purchased may all contribute to the potentially addictive nature of shopping.",

No relevant data report the actual incidence of ototoxic problems, but more than 130 products have been classified as potentially dangerous. Individual susceptibility seems highly variable, but some predisposing factors have been identified: renal failure, age, combination of ototoxic drugs, familial sensitivity to ototoxic effects or previous neurosensorial deficit. We will first discuss the ototoxic medications that have certainly been extensively studied and among which we find several antibiotics (especially aminoglycosides and macrolides), the loop diuretics, and some antimalarial or chemotherapeutic agents. Environmental toxins and drug of abuse will then be discussed briefly because scientific data are much less significant. Early recognition of subjects who are at risk of developing ototoxicity, use of therapeutic monitoring and close observation of cochleovestibular functions in high risk situations (often not easy in critical patients) are the best way to prevent severe complications that have occasionally disastrous consequences on the quality of further life.",

The application of selective and total PSD techniques caused no noticeable changes in the functional state and integrative activity of the brain, the latter warranting its successful use for treatment of some psychoneurological disturbances in clinics.

In this narrative review, we describe the phenomenology, epidemiology, mechanisms, assessment, and management of opioid-related CES. We reviewed the empirical and theoretical literature on CES in opioid-treated populations with chronic pain. Data on long-term opioid therapy (≥3 months in duration) in chronic nonmalignant pain patients were sought. The phenomenology of CES includes: inattention, concentration difficulties, memory deficits, psychomotor dysfunction, perceptual distortions, and executive dysfunction and somnolence, sleep disorders, and lethargy. Deficits may be caused by unrelieved pain or opioid therapy alone, or from a combination of these and other factors. Mechanisms include central nervous system effects, for example, direct toxic effects on neurons resulting in decreased consciousness; direct effects on processing and reaction resulting in cognitive or psychomotor impairment, and inhibitory effects on cholinergic activity. Pharmacological management approaches may include opioid dose reduction and rotation or psychostimulant use. Nonpharmacological approaches may include cognitive-behavioral therapy, mindfulness-based stress reduction, acupuncture, exercise, and yoga. The most prevalent CES include: memory deficits (73–81%), sleep disturbance (35–57%), and fatigue (10%). At its most severe, extreme cognitive dysfunction can result in frank delirium and decreased alertness can result in coma. Emotional distress, sleep disorders, and other comorbidities and treatments can worsen CES, particularly among the elderly. Conclusions about the neuropsychological domains affected by opioids are limited due to the heterogeneity of studies and methodological issues.",

      "title": "Chronic Psychosis in Dual Disorder Heroin Use Disorder Patients",
      "abstract": "In bipolar disorder, manic or depressive episodes and mixed states are frequently marked by psychotic symptoms. Moreover, psychosis may occur after substance use disorder, often intervening with the effect of making the clinical picture indistinguishable from that of a primary psychosis. Cannabinoids, stimulants, hallucinogens, alcohol and poly-use most commonly develop psychosis induced by the non-medical use of substances. Among substance use disorder users, it has not yet been ascertained whether opioids exert a psychotic effect. Still, some authors have supported the view that opioids have antidepressant, antipanic and antipsychotic effects. It has also been hypothesized that affective disorders, coupled with genetic disposition rather than affective disturbance or psychosis, result in bipolar psychosis or schizoaffective disorder, respectively. In the history of chronic psychotics, heroin use is relatively infrequent. Chronic use of psychotogenic substances and autonomous chronicity of psychotic symptoms may root in a bipolar substrate. Substance use among people with schizophrenia cannot always be justified in terms of dysphoria. Still, the number of depressive symptoms can significantly influence the risk rate for alcohol, cannabinoid use or poly-use. Dual disorder psychotic heroin-addicted patients usually enter treatment with more severe psychopathological aspects and a shorter, less severe addiction history than their non-psychotic peers suggesting that these patients are likely to benefit from opioid medication. These data indirectly confirm the antipsychotic effects of opioids and Khantzian's self-medication hypothesis. For further confirmation, patients affected by chronic psychosis and anxiety disorders tend to progress from a psychiatric disorder to a substance use disorder. In contrast, patients with mood disorders are initially affected by drug addiction. As far as dual disorder is concerned, it is advisable to employ agents that do not heavily affect dopamine metabolism in an inhibitory way since the worsening of use hampers the effectiveness upon psychotic symptoms. On the other hand, when the tie with substances is more robust, their use may amplify as a direct consequence of dopamine antagonism, as a compensatory mechanism effective throughout the reward pathway. Novel antipsychotics seem to permit equivalent effectiveness on psychotic symptoms without promoting drug use, at least to the same extent, and might have anticraving properties.",

Its hallmark feature is hypophosphatemia, although other electrolytes might also be affected. Fanconi syndrome is a generalized dysfunction of the proximal tubule characterized by proximal renal tubular acidosis (RTA), phosphaturia, glycosuria, aminoaciduria, and proteinuria. The etiology of Fanconi syndrome can be either acquired or inherited, and drugs, among them tenofovir, are a common acquired cause of this disease. We present the case of a patient with AIDS and polysubstance abuse who was admitted due to pneumonia, completed treatment, was then started on antiretroviral medication (ART) that included tenofovir alafenamide (TAF) and began presenting severe episodes of hypophosphatemia along with other electrolyte imbalances, leading the workup denoted in the case, severe complications and finally to the patient's demise. Most cases of tenofovir-related Fanconi syndrome are related to tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, but very few cases have been reported with TAF. Our case highlights this rare complication of therapy with TAF and how artificial feeding can contribute to severe electrolyte abnormalities and worsen outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Auditory hallucinations are widely regarded as symptoms of brain disease treated with medications. In an alternative paradigm, voices are understood as trauma-driven dissociated, disowned, or disavowed aspects of self; the goal is not to suppress them but to integrate them during psychotherapy. Auditory hallucinations are common in dissociative identity disorder, borderline personality disorder, and complex posttraumatic stress disorder and are not specific to psychosis. The features that differentiate psychotic from dissociative voices include the qualities of the voices themselves, as well as other symptoms: for example, compared with dissociative voices, psychotic voices are accompanied by less sociability, more formal thought disorder, more negative symptoms including blunted affect, and more delusions. The author proposes that the psychotherapy of dissociative voices can be indicated trans-diagnostically, including in a subgroup of individuals with diagnoses of schizophrenia. Psychotherapeutic strategies are illustrated with a case example.",

      "abstract": "Background: Awareness while under general anesthesia, and the later recall of what happened during surgery, can be experienced by patients as horrific events that leave lasting mental trauma behind.Patients may have both auditory and tactile perception, potentially accompanied by feelings of helplessness, inability to move, pain, and panic ranging to an acute fear of death.For some patients, the experience of awareness under anesthesia has no sequelae; for others, however, it can lead to the development of post-traumatic stress disorder, consisting of complex psychopathological phenomena such as anxiety, insomnia, nightmares, irritability, and depression possibly leading to suicidality.Methods: The literature on the subject was selectively reviewed.Results: In the absence of risk factors awareness phenomena occur in one to two per 1000 operations under general anesthesia (0.1% to 0.2%) and are thus classed as an occasionally occurring critical event.In children, the risk of such phenomena occurring is 8 to 10 times higher.These phenomena are due to an inadequate depth of anesthesia with incomplete unconsciousness.They can be promoted by a number of risk factors that are either patient-related (ASA class III or above, medication abuse), surgery-related (Caesarean section, emergency procedures, surgery at night), or anesthesia-related (anesthesia without benzodiazepines, use of muscle relaxants).Conclusion: Strategies for avoiding awareness phenomena under anesthesia include the training of staff to know about the problem and, specifically, the use of benzodiazepines, the avoidance of muscle relaxants if possible, and shielding the patient from excessive noise.EEG monitoring is effective but provides no guarantee against awareness.If awareness under anesthesia occurs despite these measures, the patient must be given expert, interdisciplinary treatment as soon after the event as possible in order to minimize its potential sequelae.",

The standardised mortality rate in all patients with an epilepsy is between 1.6 and 4.1 but considerably higher (up to 10) in those with a medically-refractory epilepsy and with additional childhood-onset comorbid problems including learning difficulties and severe four-limb spastic cerebral palsy. Mortality in epilepsy may be seizure-related (eg, resulting in an accident, including submersion1 or in convulsive status epilepticus) or associated with an underlying neurological disorder. Only a few of the factors associated with the increased mortality risk are outside the patient’s (or the family’s, in the case of children) control and largely non-preventable, notably sudden unexpected death in epilepsy and complications of the underlying neurological disorder responsible for the epilepsy. Most other factors are under some degree of control, which, although not certain to prevent premature death, may substantially reduce the risk. These include the optimisation of seizure control to prevent or at least reduce the risk of frequent tonic-clonic or tonic seizures, the recognition and appropriate management of convulsive status epilepticus and the provision of appropriate advice and action on safety and lifestyle; the latter includes specific advice on water-related activities, both in and outside the home.\n\nThe retrospective study by Franklin et al 2 identified epilepsy as a risk factor in childhood drowning deaths, with a prevalence of 4.1% of drowning fatalities, compared with 0.7%–1.7% among the general, 0–14 years population (relative risk: 2.4–5.8). There was no increased risk associated with other pre-existing medical conditions, including asthma and intellectual disabilities. The study would seem to confirm the well-recognised association between drowning and epilepsy and that drowning remains the most common …",

It is characterized by disturbance of attention, awareness, and fluctuating levels of severity over the course of a day. It is also usually associated with anxiety, restlessness, irritability, disorientation, and sleep disturbances. Delirium is frequently missed or misdiagnosed by the health care team. This may relate to symptom fluctuation and transient lucidity, in addition to overlapping clinical features with dementia and depression, compounded by a lack of or inadequate delirium screening. Although the nonpharmacological management of delirium is a key component of care, delirious patients who are very distressed or a potential risk to themselves or others may require pharmacological management for their symptoms, including “rescue” doses of midazolam or lorazepam if not responding to antipsychotics.",

Halluzinationen können in allen Sinnesmodalitäten auftreten und je nach Semiologie diagnostisch hilfreich sein. In besonderer Weise haben die schizophrenen akustischen Halluzinationen klar die Nähe zur Sprache und sind wegweisendes diagnostisches Merkmal. Die Neuroanatomie der Stimmen zeigt, dass beim Stimmenhörer Hirngebiete ursächlich beteiligt sind, die beim Gesunden für Hören, Sprechen und Verstehen verantwortlich sind – sogar unabhängig von der Ätiologie. Neben der Standardtherapie des Stimmenhörens, die aus der Gabe von Antipsychotika besteht, werden bei Therapieresistenz vermehrt Hirnstimulationsmethoden eingesetzt und hier vorgestellt. Allen voran die repetitive transkranielle Magnetstimulation (rTMS) und transkranielle Gleichstrombehandlung (tDCS), wobei die rTMS ihren Platz in der Therapie von resistenten Halluzinationen bereits gefunden hat.

      "title": "The Depressed Patient",
      "abstract": "DEPRESSION IS A PHENOMENON that most of us experience to a greater or lesser degree at some time in our lives. It is a psychophysiological state, manifested psychologically by feelings of sadness, worthlessness, hopelessness, of emptiness. There is a lack of interest in the events of the outside world. Activities that are usually enjoyed become flat, dull, meaningless. Physically, there is a slowing down of bodily functions. The respiratory rate is slow. The gastrointestinal slowdown results in retarded emptying of the stomach and intestines, leading to a loss of appetite, a feeling of fullness in the stomach, burping, and constipation. Muscle tension decreases, leading to drooping facies, the slumped posture, the slow, dragging gait. Eyeballs tend to be sunken and the eyes lacking in luster. Sleep disturbance is common. There may be difficulty in going to sleep, in staying asleep, or, on the other hand, there may be an increased desire for sleep. Along with a lessened interest in external events, there is a loss of interest in grooming and personal hygiene. The same dark, dull clothes may be worn day after day. These manifestations seem to reflect the depressed person's general lack of selfesteem and self-confidence, and his lack of belief that life can be worth living. The cognitive functions are slowed down. Questions are answered hesitantly, often after a pause. Conversation is seldom initiated and often confined to monosyllables and to reminiscing about past events, frequently of an unhappy nature. Cryng is frequent. Thinking requires conscious effort. Concentration is difficult. The attention span is short for topics unrelated to the feelings of the depression. The depressed person's attitude toward life itself varies from a feeling that this world is unfit to live in to a belief that one is not fit to live and that the world would be a better place if one were not in it, that is, if one were dead. The former set of attitudes is frequently an unspoken plea for succor and support. The latter, which usually occurs only in pathological states of deep depression, indicates a suicidal danger. The old adage that one who talks of suicide will not kill himself is unfounded. Anyone who talks of suicide should be regarded with concern and the matter investigated by someone skilled in dealing with psychiatric illness. Nursing care must be provided to protect the person against his self-destructive tendencies and to reduce the environmental hazards, although this latter is difficult in ordinary life situations. Constant supportive nursing care is probably more fruitful and much more comforting to the person involved.

      "title": "Touching the unconscious in the unconscious – hypnotic communication with unconscious patients",
      "abstract": "If hypnosis means contact to the unconscious to modulate psychological and physiological functions by means of suggestions, and if this is facilitated by attenuation of the critical mind, then the question arises as to whether suggestions also have an effect when waking consciousness is otherwise eliminated, namely by coma or anesthesia. A prerequisite would be perception, which actually is evidenced by reports of patients after traumatic brain injury, artificial coma, resuscitation or general anesthesia. Moreover, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) frequently observed after these medical situations is hardly explainable without some sort of awareness under such conditions. Even advanced neurophysiological diagnostic cannot yet rule out consciousness or sensory processing. Especially reference to perception during unconsciousness is given by the results of a recent multicenter study on the effects of hypnotic communication with patients under controlled adequate deep general anesthesia. The observed reductions in incidence and severity of postoperative pain, opioid use, nausea and vomiting cannot be explained by the reaction of a few but only by a considerable proportion of patients. This leads to a strong plea for a more careful treatment of unconscious patients in the emergency room, operating theater or intensive care unit, for the abandonment of the restriction of therapeutic communication to awake patients, and for new aspects of communication and hypnosis research. Obviously, loss of consciousness does not protect against psychological injury, and continuation of communication is needed. But how and what to talk to unconscious patients? Generally addressing the unconscious mind with suggestions that generally exert their effects unconsciously, hypnotic communication appears to be the adequate language. Especially addressing meaningful topics, as derived from the basic psychological needs and known stressors, appears essential. With respect to negative effects by negative or missing communication or to the proposed protective and supporting effects of therapeutic communication with patients clinically rated as unconscious, the role of consciousness is secondary. For the effects of perceived signals and suggestions it does not matter whether consciousness is absent, or partial, or unrecognized present.",

Case presentation: A twenty one year old indian male patient who is a known case of generalized epilepsy for past 2 years on sodium valproate presented with acute onset chorea, four days after starting phenytoin sodium with normal serum phenytoin levels. After excluding the other possible causes of chorea, phenytoin was withdrawn which resulted in a dramatic subsidence of chorea .On rechallenge with phenytoin patient again developed chorieform movements which again subsided after drug withdrawl, thus implicating phenytoin as the possible etiological agent for chorea Conclusion:Phenytoin rarely induces involuntary movements as adverse effect.During phenytoin therapy,if a patient develops involuntary movements,phenytoin toxicity should be suspected. Drug withdrawl leads to complete symptomatic improvement thereby avoiding extensive workup for other secondary causes. Key words: phenytoin induced chorea, drug induced movement disorders, antiepileptics induced dyskinesias, phenytoin and involuntary movements, anticonvulsants and dyskinesias , phenytoin toxicity",

Diffuse paroxysmal discharges in the EEG appeared when the patient was blinking in darkness or in bright light. Closing the eyes voluntarily, on command, or as a reflex reaction produced this response very infrequently. During intermittent photic stimulation the epileptic discharges were accompanied by myoclonic jerks. The act of beginning to speak was linked with spontaneous blinking and EEG changes and was accompanied consistently by seizures. These were characterized by a peculiar stuttering and an absencelike impairment of consciousness. Seizures have been controlled well using clonazepam and valproic acid.",

The degree of cognitive deficits may vary from very subtle changes in areas unimportant to the patient to very pronounced difficulties in several cognitive domains preventing the person from independent functioning or even requiring hospitalization. Neurocognitive deficits have a significant effect on patients' quality of life (QOL) with more severe impairment leading to lower QOL. Cancer treatments such as radiation and chemotherapy have the potential to interact with neurocognition. Additionally, changes in mood and other psychiatric symptoms, and fatigue, can have significant impact on quality of life.",

It is characterized by a high degree of penetrance, variable expressivity, manifestation in different age periods. This disorder, transmitted in an autosomal dominant way, does not have gender differences. The disease often progresses slowly but steadily over many years, eventually leading to severe disability. The clinical picture of this disease has a pathognomonic combination of neurological (extrapyramidal) and neuropsychiatric disorders. With the addition of mental disorders, especially dementia, the diagnosis of HD becomes more likely and obvious. However, if disorders in the mental sphere, including irritability, irascibility, apathy, abulia, delirium, hallucinations, impaired memory and attention, become the debut of the disease, then they largely mask clinical picture. In such cases, patients are hastily made other diagnoses: psychopathy, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, Alzheimer’s disease, and others. You should be wary of the possible secondary nature of neuropsychiatric disorders in patients, especially young patients.",

Diagnosis is essentially based on the 1990 American College of Rheumatology Classificative Criteria, but if, in some cases, they are not completely fulfilled, diagnosis is not excluded in a particular patient. The causes of the enhanced pain perception and of all the other clinical characteristics are unknown. Both the central hypothesis (sleep disturbance; psychological affection; hypothalamus-hypophysis-adrenal axis disorder; neuromediators disregulation; etc.) and the peripheral theory (anatomical and/or functional muscle disturbance) try to explain FMS etiopathogenesis. Tricycles antidepressants (i.e. amitriptilin) and some muscle relaxants (i.e. ciclobenzaprine) have demonstrated some beneficial effect contrary to the classic antirheumatic drugs (NSAID; corticosteroids; etc.). Physical exercise, multidisciplinary support (behavioural therapy, physical agents; etc.) and patient education are some of the other approaches which contribute to the correct management of FMS.",

Anksioznost kao simptom postoji u svim psihickim poremecajima, ali kao primarni simptom javlja se u anksioznim, stresom uzrokovanim i somatoformnim poremecajima. Anksioznost kao psihicki poremecaj ukljucuje i specificne simptome koji dovode do neurobioloske disfunkcije, te zahtijevaju posebne terapijske procedure, a smanjuju socijalnu i radnu sposobnost. Simptomi karakteristicni za anksioznost dijele se na psiholoske i tjelesne simptome. Psiholoski simptomi su: pretjerana plasljivost i strahovanje, osjecaj unutarnje napetosti i nemira, smetnje koncentacije, pojacana osjetljivost na buku, smetnje spavanja, smetnje u pamcenju. Tjelesni se simptomi mogu ocitovati na gotovo svim organskim sustavima. Karakteristicni su : kardiovaskularni, respiratorni, gastrointestinalni, genito-urinarni, neuroloski. Anksiozni poremecaji praceni su visokom stopom suicidalnosti, a predisponiraju i za razvoj raznovrsnih psihosomatskih bolesti.\r\n Psiholoske teorije anksioznost objasnjavaju kao premjestanje intrapsihickog konflikta (psihodinamski model), te kao fenomen uvjetovanja (kognitivno bihevioralni model).\r\n Psihodinamska teorija anksioznost objasnjava kao konflikt između ida i ega.\r\n Kognitivna teorija anksioznost objasnjava kao tendenciju prekomjerne procjene potencijala za opasnost.\r\n Dijagnoza se temelji na pažljivo prikupljenoj anamnezi, procjeni psihickog i somatskog statusa te ucinjenih somatskih pregleda i pretraga.\r\n Najcesci anksiozni poremecaji su:\r\n *generalizirani anksiozni poremecaj\r\n *panicni poremecaj\r\n *fobije\r\n *anksiozno depresivni poremecaj\r\n *opsesivno kompulzivni poremecaj\r\n *anksioznost u organskih bolesnika\r\n *posttraumatski stresni poremecaj\r\n Lijecenje se sastoji od kombinacije farmakoterapije i psihoterapije.\r\n Provodi se ambulantno i bolnicki.

U radu sa psihijatrijskim bolesnikom medicinska sestra se pridržava nacela zdravstvene njege psihijatrijskog bolesnika. Medicinska sestra prati bolesnika prilikom boravka na odjelu u njegovim aktivnostima u koje je ukljucen na odjelu, susrece se sa pacijentovom obitelji, uocava promjene i izvjestava lijecnika i strucni tim.\r\n Osnova cjelokupnog terapijskog djelovanja u radu medicinske sestre s anksioznim bolesnicima usmjerena je na smanjenje tenzija.

Depressive features in Parkinson patients are very close to those of endogenous depression, except for a relative lack of anxiety, irritability, suicidal ideations, delusions and circadian rhythm. Pharmacotherapy with antidepressants is most reliable in the treatment of parkinsonian depressives, although levodopa or other antiparkinsonian drugs may relieve a depression. Hallucinatory complications of long-term antiparkinsonian treatment appear in two types of symptoms: (1) hallucinosis type – vivid visual hallucination and illusion with clear consciousness and well-preserved orientation, and (2) delirium type – less vivid visual hallucination and illusion with disturbed orientation and confusion. Antipsychotic drugs and 'drug holiday' are recommended for the management of hallucinations as side effects of antiparkinsonian drugs.",

Many features that are important in terms of driving adversely affected under the influence of alcohol and substance and therefore impaired driving behavior arises in drivers.The most effective way to fight for preventing this impaired driver behav- ior is the restrictions and regulations imposed on drivers in traffic related to alcohol and drug use. Nevertheless, in the literature, some drivers continue to impaired driving function with a risky traffic behavior, in which the driver personality (risk-taking, thrill-seeking, self-control), psychopathologi- cal (substance abuse, personality disorders, mood disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, anger and aggression), and many other neuropsychological features are considered to have a relationship with this situation. In this article psychological, psychopathological and neuropsychological studies have examined regarding drive under the influence of alcohol and drug.",

We report here a clinical case in which a 46-year-old man, suffering from a schizoaffective disorder (depressed type), underwent olanzapine treatment (20 mg/day). After inducing an initial amelioration, the patient had a re-exacerbation of auditory hallucinations and a clinical and psychosocial worsening, which subsided after olanzapine discontinuation. Olanzapine may induce a worsening of hallucinations in a psychotic disorder with substantial affective component and therefore its use should be carefully evaluated in such cases.",

The sense of body image and body ego are altered in ways that are frightening or confusing to the patient. The subjkective experience of time becomes present-oriented, with time moving slowly. Grief or depression, clinically distinct responses, may further debilitate the individual. Anxiety, guilt and rage are additional emotional responses. Patients use previously existing coping patterns to manage the crisis of sudden disability. It is not the nature or the severity of the injury that exclusively influences the psychological response, but rather, it is the interaction of the person and the total environment that determines behavior.",

These situations are associatively connected to the past but the patient is unaware of the connection. Acting out has to be differentiated from other neurotic actions which occur during analysis. In particular it has to be differentiated from symptomatic actions and abreaction experiences. Acting out differs from symptomatic actions in that the symptomatic act is ego alien and usually refers to part of a past situation. Acting out occurs very frequently during analysis. It should be remembered, however, that it also occurs outside the realm of psychoanalysis, but then it is not available for investigation and interpretation. The main reason for the frequent occurrence of acting out during the course of analysis is bound up with the transference.",

      "abstract": "Hyponatremia, defined as serum sodium below 135 mmol/l, is a potentially life-threatening condition and was shown to be more frequent in elderly and psychiatric patients. In the last years numerous case reports on SSRI- and venlafaxine-induced hyponatremia were published indicating a higher incidence than previously thought. Only few studies have been performed and the incidence reported varies widely from 4.6/1000 people to 25%. It is still unclear if any single SSRI shows a higher incidence of hyponatremia than the others. Some data suggest that venlafaxine may have a stronger association to hyponatremia than SSRIs. Risk factors include age, female sex, low body mass index, severe physical illness, history of former hyponatremia and co-medications known to induce hyponatremia, especially thiazide diuretics. Symptoms of hyponatremia are usually neuropsychiatric (e.g. restlessness, lethargy, cognitive impairment), and any worsening in psychiatric symptoms in patients with a corresponding risk-profile receiving SSRIs or venlafaxine should give cause to check serum electrolytes. Usually SSRI-induced hyponatremia occurs within approximately 30 days and is reported to improve after withdrawal of the drug. Further controlled studies to confirm the true incidence of hyponatremia due to SSRI or venlafaxine and to define predictors more precisely are needed.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Neglect is the failure to report, respond, or orient to novel or meaningful stimuli presented to the side opposite a brain lesion, when this failure cannot be attributed to either sensory or motor defects (Heilman, 1979). Neglect may be spatial or personal. Spatial neglect may occur in three reference frames: body centered, environmentally centered, and object centered. One may be inattentive to stimuli in space or on the person (attentional or sensory neglect) and one may fail to act in a portion of space, in a spatial direction, or to use a portion of one’s body (intentional or motor neglect). Many specific disorders have been described, distinguished by their presumed underlying mechanisms, the distribution of the abnormal behavior, and the means of eliciting the behavior. Different behavioral manifestations may occur at different times, and in some patients certain manifestations are never seen. The major behavioral manifestations that we will discuss in this chapter include (1) inattention or sensory neglect, (2) extinction to simultaneous stimuli, (3) motor neglect, (4) spatial neglect, (5) personal neglect, (6) allesthesia and allokinesia, and (7) anosognosia (unawareness of illness). The first section of this chapter will define specific disorders and describe clinical tests that may be used to assess them.",

      "abstract": "Se trata de una observacion clinica durante un periodo de dos anos de un joven de 21 anos que se presentaba muchas veces en urgencias por una fuerte angustia con importantes trastornos del comportamiento caracterizados por agitaciones psicomotrices, automutilaciones repetidas, amenazas o intentos de homicidio hacia el padre, impulsos frecuentes y a veces conductas antisociales (fugas, estados de peligrosidad). En sus trastornos subyacian muchas veces ideas de persecucion y de referencia. Habia tambien frecuentes intentos de suicidio vinculados con breves periodos depresivos en los que verbalizaba un gran sufrimiento afectivo, que el explicaba esencialmente por dificultades relacionales familiares y por acontecimientos traumaticos (maltrato parental, accidentes). Dos anos despues, el cuadro clinico se agravo con la aparicion de sintomas esquizofrenicos constituidos por un delirio paranoide, alucinaciones con automatismo mental, retraccion social, desorganizacion afectiva y comportamental que se sustituyeron totalmente en sus pasos al acto autoagresivos. Luego se han vuelto mas complejos con la observacion psicoterapica que abre la problematica sexual e identitaria del paciente.La observacion consistio en una escucha atenta durante las entrevistas psicoterapicas regulares que han permitido recorrer la historia evolutiva de esta patologia, al mismo tiempo que su estabilizacion. Nuestro objetivo era despejar una perspectiva clinica y evolutiva que tomara en cuenta la progresion de los sintomas en funcion del tiempo hasta la constitucion de una psicosis propiamente dicha. Limitado por la exploracion neurobiologica (balances, EEG, IRM cerebral) sin resultado aparente, el analisis semiologico de los sintomas del paciente, de sus escritos y de sus simbolos nos ha permitido investigar diferentes fases precoces de la enfermedad, asi como el analisis psicopatologico de sus sintomas.Resultados: Esta experiencia personal nos ha permitido determinar el primer sintoma, conocer el periodo inicial de los trastornos y sus relaciones con los factores de vulnerabilidad (trauma parental y genetico), describir su evolucion segun la edad y reconstituir los sintomas de transicion psicotica. El fin de este articulo es subrayar el papel preventivo de la atencion precoz de los trastornos prepsicoticos. Sin embargo, sigue en pie el interrogante sobre el impacto de la angustia en el desarrollo neuropsiquico del paciente y sobre el origen genetico de la enfermedad. Conclusion: Insistimos en el enfoque preventivo que consiste en detectar los sujetos con riesgos de transicion psicotica y pensar en realizar una psicoterapia adaptada.",

According to pathological and neuroimaging studies, the traditional view of Parkinson's disease that begins with the development of motor symptoms such as bradykinesia, rigidity and tremor, has begun to change. It is now understood that there would be a \"premotor\" or \"preclinical\" period in which the alphasynuclein pathology begins outside of the substantia nigra in the lower brainstem and autonomic nervous system. Although the pathophysiology of this phase is still unclear, it is currently thought that its symptoms would correspond to the so-called \"non-motor symptoms\". Hyposmia, depression, constipation and REM sleep disorders are one of the most relevant non-motor symptoms at this \"premotor\" stage. The spectrum of non-motor symptoms is very broad and covers the domains of neuropsychiatric, dysautonomic, gastrointestinal and sensory symptoms as well as sleep disorders. Neuropsychiatric symptoms such as depression, impulse control disorder, psychosis and dementia, are a major cause of disability as they are directly related to quality of life.",

      "abstract": "The aim of this article is to review the literature on the effects of psychostimulants in epileptic subjects in order to reach a consensus statement regarding the use or abuse of these substances.Psychostimulant substances have been considered the drugs that share the ability to produce excitation of the CNS leading to convulsions. The stimulation may be at cortical, brainstem, or spinal levels. In this article, the following cortical stimulants are analyzed and discussed: cocaine, amphetamine and related agents, caffeine, cannabinoids, and psychedelic drugs. This review is based on research done using pharmacological textbooks and Medline.The use of cocaine is associated with the occurrence of seizures. The reported frequency varies from 1% to 40% of addicted subjects, based on the typology of the considered study. Amphetamines and related drugs rarely induce epileptic seizures at therapeutic doses, but seizures may occur after the first dosing. Caffeine at high doses may induce epileptic seizures because of its adenosine receptor-antagonizing properties. Marijuana, at variance with other psychostimulants, owing to its serotonin-mediated anticonvulsant action, could have a medical use for the treatment of epilepsy. Psychedelic compounds rarely induce epileptic seizures, but the most common clinical CNS complication after ingestion of ecstasy is the occurrence of seizures.The use of psychostimulants, except for marijuana, can induce single or multiple seizures in healthy subjects.",

Symptoms of SIPD include but are not limited to paranoia and hallucinations, negative symptoms, disinhibition or dreaminess, and/or sensations of heightened awareness. In cocaine use, there also exist paranoid delusions and hallucinations. While there is no definitive standard of treatment to address SIPD, management of such disorders tends to vary depending on substances used, clinical symptomatology, dosage, frequency, and chronicity, among other variables. Given that the relationship between SIPD and the development of several mental illnesses is well established, a long-term follow-up period is needed to identify, prevent, and effectively treat further relapses.

That is, the hypnagogic state could be a kind of reluctance to sleep because sleeping means to meet the failing protective object. Extreme situations often produce hypnagogic states, like situations of war or near-death states or near coma states. Usually, the hypnagogic and hypnopompic phenomena are not indicative of dysfunctional or pathological processes. But when they last longer than usual, they may be indicative of a state where sleeping instead of being a container for the mind has turned into something scary or threatening. This is when sub-thalamic fears may appear. Primitive mental states usually follow these feelings and require a good deal of imagination to put all the split experiences together. The way the container functions is related to the initial experiences of life with the mother.",

The frequency of arousals from slow-wave sleep with delta or mixed-frequency activity has a high sensitivity but relatively low specificity for the diagnosis of arousal parasomnias.Disorders of arousal (sleepwalking, sleep terrors, and confusional arousals) are characterized by incomplete awakenings from slow-wave sleep, limited recall of imagery, and partial or complete amnesia. They occur most frequently in childhood. Management includes correction of precipitating factors, attention to safety, behavioral techniques, and medications. Sleep-related eating disorder is a variant of arousal disorders and may be associated with the use of short-acting hypnotics and restless legs syndrome. Complex nocturnal visual hallucinations can occur with visual loss, dementia with Lewy bodies, use of β-adrenergic receptor antagonists, and anxiety. Exploding head syndrome occurs at wake-sleep transition or on waking during the night, is usually benign, and requires treatment only if significant sleep disruption occurs.",

      "title": "A possible link between circadian rhythm disorders and mood disorders",
      "abstract": "Circadian rhythm disorders are problems with your circadian rhythm, the internal body that keeps your biological processes in step. This cycle lasts about 24 hours. The term circadian comes from Latin words that mean “around the day.” Patterns of brain waves, hormone production, cell regrowth, and other activities are linked to this cycle. Your circadian rhythm plays a key role in things like when you sleep and when you wake. Your normal circadian clock is set by the cycle of light and dark over 24 hours. People with circadian rhythm disorders may have problems: Falling asleep, Staying asleep, Waking up too early and not being able to go back to sleep, Getting sleep but not feeling refreshed by it. Things that can cause circadian rhythm disorders include Shift work, Pregnancy, Time zone changes, Medications, Changes in routine, such as staying up late or sleeping in, Medical problems including Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease, Mental health problems, Menopause. Various Circadian Rhythm Disorders include Jet lag, or rapid time zone change syndrome: This involves symptoms like too much sleepiness and a lack of daytime alertness in people who travel across time zones. It gets worse with each time zone crossed, especially when traveling toward the east. Shift work sleep disorder: This sleep disorder affects people who frequently rotate shifts or work at night. A conflict between someone’s circadian rhythm and the time of their shift can mean they get up to 4 hours less sleep than the average person. Delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS): This is a disorder of sleep timing. People with DSPS tend to fall asleep very late at night and have a hard time waking up in time for work, school, or social activities. It’s especially common in teens and young adults. Advanced sleep phase syndrome (ASPS): This is a disorder in which a person goes to sleep earlier and wakes earlier than they wanted. For example, they might fall asleep between 6 and 9 p.m. and wake up between 1 and 5 a.m. Non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder: This disorder often affects people who are blind because the circadian clock is set by the light-dark cycle. With this condition, that cycle is disturbed. It can cause a serious lack of sleep time and quality at night and sleepiness during daylight hours. Irregular sleep-wake rhythm disorder: With this disorder, people’s circadian rhythms are jumbled. They may sleep in a series of naps over 24 hours. Seasonal affective disorder and all the circadian rhythm disorders are related to a discrepancy between the duration of the solar day and the circadian cycle. The circadian cycle of humans and other mammals is close to one hour longer than the 24 hours period from sunrise to sunrise. Interestingly, birds show a circadian cycle of less than 24 hours and close to 23 hours. Terrestrial invertebrates, the insects provide the key to understanding this discrepancy. The earliest identifiably mammalian fossils are from the Permian era strata. Insect orders that first appeared in the Permian era include the Hemiptera (bugs), Orthoptera (crickets and grasshoppers), Coleoptera (beetles) and the Neuroptera (lacewings). All of whose modern survivors show a circadian cycle longer than 24 hours in at least some stage of the life cycle. The insects whose ancestors first appeared in Mesozoic strata with the birds include Hymenoptera (bees, wasps and ants) and Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths). Their modern survivors, like the birds, demonstrate a circadian rhythm shorter than 24 hours. It is proposed here that the duration of these animal classes circadian day may reflect the duration of the solar day at the time of their origin. There is now evidence for three large meteorite impacts on Pangea near the end of the Permian era, one in Wilkes Land of Antarctica, one near the Falkland Islands, and one just west of Australia. The eastward movement of the Australian, African, and Eurasian continent/plate and the southeastward movement of the Antarctic continents/plates suggest that those meteorites were moving eastwards and struck the planet obliquely. Having done so, they might have imparted momentum to the planet’s rotation and so accelerated it. This may mean that circadian rhythm disorders are the consequence of a change in the duration of the solar day due to a disaster and that daytime lethargy and depression may have had adaptive value to the mammals who survived that disaster. If this is true, it adds context to our treatment of these disorders with bright light and melatonin",

Manic and depressive symptoms can be related to hydrocephalus occlusus even in the absence of neurological symptoms.These symptoms disappear after neurosurgery or pharmacological treatment. A 26 year old-male,from Cabo Verde,is interviewed in the Emergency Department in June 2011 presenting disturbance of general behaviour.He is being aggressive and presents flight of ideas.The diagnosis: \"Hypomanic state\" treated with lorazepam 6 mg/day and Olanzapine 5 mg/day. August 2011, the patient is reevaluated because of his behaviour:soliloquies,laughs,expansive mood, abnormal irritability, easily excited to enthusiasm and irritable humor. He also presents psychomotor agitation associated to delusion of persecution.He has not been taking his medication. No other neurological symptoms are detected. In Hospital he receives Risperidone 6 mg/day, Clorazepate Dipotassium45mg/day and Lormetazepam 2 mg /day disappearing most of the symptoms. A MRI was done, presenting triventricular hydrocephalus with absence of intraparenchymal damage.After monitoring the intracranial pressure, Neurosurgery decides not to perform surgery. In the case of not responding to Risperidone, studies have been published that Aripiprazole (atypical antipsychotic with a unique partial agonistic effect at D2receptors)is effective and safe in the treatment of manic episode. Some publications about the reduction of D2receptors demonstrated that the binding of striatal was reduced in NPH. Sometimes imaging tests are needed in patients with behavioural disturbance as manic symptoms in order to avoid misdiagnosis and it is crucial for the correct medical and chirurgical treatment.",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Familial paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dyskinesia (PNKD) is characterized by unilateral or bilateral involuntary movements. Attacks are typically precipitated by coffee, tea, or alcohol; they can also be triggered by excitement, stress, or fatigue, or can be spontaneous. Attacks involve dystonic posturing with choreic and ballistic movements, may be accompanied by a preceding aura, occur while the individual is awake, and are not associated with seizures. Attacks last minutes to hours and rarely occur more than once per day. Attack frequency, duration, severity, and combinations of symptoms vary within and among families. Age of onset is typically in childhood or early teens but can be as late as age 50 years. Diagnosis/testing The clinical diagnosis of familial PNKD is suspected in a proband who presents with attacks of dystonia, chorea, and/or ballismus typically provoked by alcohol or caffeine. Identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in PNKD by molecular genetic testing confirms the diagnosis. Management Treatment of manifestations: Avoid triggers (e.g., caffeine, alcohol, excitement, stress, fatigue). Response to pharmacologic treatment is poor; clonazepam or diazepam can be effective in some individuals. Some individuals have responded to gabapentin, levetiracetam, or acetazolamide. Surveillance: Monitor medication requirements and dosage. Genetic counseling Familial PNKD is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. To date, all reported individuals with familial PNKD have inherited PNKD from an affected parent. Offspring of an affected individual have a 50% chance of inheriting the PNKD pathogenic variant. Once the PNKD pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic diagnosis are possible.",

In addition, delirium is usually a sign of the presence of significant medical complications and is associated with increased mortality.

The hypothalamus and its connections with the anterior and posterior pituitary gland comprise the hypothalamic-pituitary unit [1,2]. The hypothalamus regulates additional vegetative and autonomic functions, including eating, drinking, and temperature. Lesions in or around the hypothalamic-pituitary unit cause various clinical syndromes in the endocrine system associated with decreased or increased hormonal secretions. Tumors in or around the hypothalamus also produce other vegetative symptoms and involve other neural structures nearby; the optic nerves and chiasm are particularly vulnerable. At times extension into the cavernous sinus causes eye movement diffi culties. Occasionally obstruction of the third ventricle and its outflow results in hydrocephalus.

Modern sleep research has opened important views into the structure of sleep and the pathophysiology of sleep disorders. In a narrower sense sleep disorders mean a deficiency of sleep (hyposomnia). This may concern the induction of sleep or its maintenance. Sleep disorders without underlying disease may be differentiated from those caused by different diseases. Hypersomnia may occur as a symptom of various cerebral dysfunctions and processes, as an episodic disorder (Kleine-Levin-syndrome) or as a part of the Pickwick-syndrome. In narcolepsy characteristic symptoms are sleep attacks, kataplexy (emotionally induced loss of muscle tone) and transient pareses during awakening. Disturbances linked with sleep are snoring, somnambulism, speaking and grinding of the teeth during sleep and nocturnal enuresis. They may constitute idiopathic disorders. On the other hand, there may be similarities between epileptic phenomena and these disorders. Some epilepsies demonstrate relations to the rhythm of sleep and wakefulness which become evident in the manifestation of seizures and epileptiform EEG activity at certain stages of vigilance.",

Su utilizacion se debe principalmente a dos motivos: por su accion analgesica en algunos cuadros clinicos de dolor neuropatico, y por sus propiedades antidepresivas, logicamente, e incluso ansioliticas en algunos casos. Hasta el momento, no se conoce con exactitud el mecanismo de accion por el cual los antidepresivos producen su efecto analgesico, ni tampoco las diferencias entre ellos en el contexto del dolor. Centrandonos en las investigaciones preclinicas, es necesario de cara a un futuro desarrollo de nuevos farmacos antidepresivos analgesicos, conocer la sensibilidad de los diferentes modelos de dolor a los mecanismos especificos de accion antidepresiva. Los antidepresivos con alguna excepcion suelen ejercer su accion farmacologica inhibiendo la recaptacion de monoaminas, concretamente serotonina y noradrenalina, y este mismo mecanismo parece ser el que les concede actividad analgesica. Asimismo, este mecanismo les hace poseer accion ansiolitica. Es necesario por tanto en psicofarmacologia preclinica, discernir sobre la capacidad de los diferentes antidepresivos para inducir efecto antidepresivo, analgesico y ansiolitico en diferentes metodos que puedan servir para orientar la investigacion futura en este campo. Tambien es necesario conocer su capacidad de producir efectos sobre la cognicion ya que su uso cronico puede derivar en un deterioro cognitivo . Un aspecto de gran importancia y que ha constituido uno de los objetivos de esta tesis es saber el rango de potencia en relacion con la dosificacion de los antidepresivos y su mecanismo de accion como agentes capaces de inducir efecto analgesico y ansiolitico. Es decir, es importante conocer si las dosis a las que se evidencia un efecto analgesico son las mismas a las que se observa un efecto ansiolitico y tambien relacionar este orden de potencia con los efectos cognitivos. Como quiera que el mecanismo de accion de los antidepresivos esta relacionado con la inhibicion de la recaptacion de serotonina y noradrenalina y que los rangos de potencia para inducir este efecto son diferente entre ellos, es de importancia saber que modelos son mas sensibles a un mecanismo u otro. Es decir, es de interes conocer que modelos son mas especificos para detectar un efecto serotoninergico o noradrenergico o los dos, en relacion con el efecto antidepresivo, ansiolitico, analgesico y cognitivo. Tambien es importante, puesto que la mayor parte de los modelos son interferidos por la posible capacidad que tienen los antidepresivos de producir cambios en la motricidad, conocer si los efectos que observamos estan o no relacionados con estos cambios motores, con el fin de no inducirnos a error en futuras investigaciones.",

      "abstract": "Concern is increasing about the worldwide epidemic and consequences of dementia. The high prevalence of dementing conditions in medical settings, often undiagnosed, and the association of dementia with longer hospital stays and greater use of health resources have direct implications for psychosomatic medicine and consultation-liaison psychiatry. The psychiatric consultant is an invaluable collaborator with other health care professionals in the identification, evaluation, treatment, management, discharge planning, placement, and rehabilitation of the patient with dementia. In this chapter, we focus on the general clinical approach to dementia and its common causes. Some of these and other causes of dementia are also discussed elsewhere in this book: those disorders that are particularly likely to present with other neurological symptoms in Chapter 30, \"Neurology and Neurosurgery\"; HIV and other infections in Chapter 26, \"Infectious Diseases\"; alcohol and other substance use in Chapter 16, \"Substance-Related Disorders\"; toxic/metabolic conditions in Chapter 21, \"Endocrine and Metabolic Disorders,\" and Chapter 35, \"Medical Toxicology\"; rheumatological/inflammatory conditions in Chapter 24, \"Rheumatology\"; traumatic brain injury in Chapter 33, \"Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation\"; and paraneoplastic syndromes in Chapter 22, \"Oncology.\"",

      "abstract": "Shortly after dopamine-receptor blocking agents began to be used for treatment of psychoses in the 1950s, a variety of movement disorders began to be described in the literature and to be attributed to the antipsychotic agents (Crane, 1973). Some of those movement disorders were difficult to treat, and they sometimes persisted after cessation of the antipsychotic treatment (Druckman, Seelinger, & Thulin, 1962). The resulting persistent syndrome, consisting of repetitive oral-buccal-lingual movements (chewing movements; lip puckering, sucking, or smacking; tongue protrusions; side-to-side jaw deviations), was referred to as tardive dyskinesia, and later as classic tardive dyskinesia (Fahn, 1985). The oral-buccal-lingual movements, sometimes accompanied by repetitive limb movements, were labeled “tardive” because they generally appeared only after prolonged treatment with antipsychotics (Faurbye et al., 1964), though there were some reports of persistent movements appearing soon after initiation of therapy (Angle & Mclntire, 1968).",

      "abstract": "Some studies have demonstrated that cognitive decline occurs in Dravet syndrome, starting shortly after the onset of seizures, rapidly progressing and then plateauing within a few years. It is unclear whether children that develop the syndrome had entirely normal cognitive skills before seizure onset, since subtle impairment easily escapes recognition in small infants. It is also difficult to demonstrate whether a recognisable profile of cognitive impairment or a definite behavioural phenotype exists. No clear‐cut imaging or neuropathological marker or substrate has been recognised for cognitive impairment in this syndrome. However, there are different potentially causative factors, including the specific effects on the Nav1.1 channels caused by the underlying genic or genomic defect; frequent and prolonged convulsive and non‐convulsive seizures or status epilepticus; recurrent subtle ictal phenomena, such as that accompanying pronounced visual sensitivity; the use of antiepileptic drugs with cognitive side effects, especially in heavy multiple‐drug therapy; and the restrictions that children with severe epilepsy inevitably undergo.",

Movement disorders in psychiatric patients are usually related to neuroleptic medicines.

      "abstract": "To carry out a bibliographic review of articles indexed in MEDLINE over the past 20 years concerning the pharmacological treatment of agitation in head injury.Head injury may cause different behaviour changes, of which agitation is the most dramatic. The incidence of agitation after severe head injury varies from 11% to 50% depending on the study involved. This incidence is high enough to warrant specific management. Drug treatment has variable results. When there is imminent danger of harm to the patient himself or to others, or when aggressive behaviour makes medical management difficult, the benzodiazepines have been found useful. Antipsychotic drugs are only indicated in head injury when the agitation causes a clinical emergency, and in such a case the more potent drugs such as haloperidol are best, since they have less sedative effect. They are also effective when the clinical features are similar to those of classical schizophrenia. Antiepileptic drugs have been used successfully for treating agitation-aggressiveness, specially in paroxystic behaviour disorders. We also consider other treatments used for posttraumatic agitation.There is no general agreement amongst doctors as to the best treatment for posttraumatic agitation in head injury. However, with regard to certain characteristics of agitation different drugs may be recommended for treatment.",

Some anti epileptic drugs may aggravate an epileptic syndrome. In 10-15% of patients with epilepsy, better control of seizures can be achieved with combination therapy. These patients are at greater risk of suffering clinically serious interactions. Drug interactions occur at the pharmacokinetic level and at the pharmacodynamic level, involving synergistic or antagonistic effects. Finally many drugs can interfere with the antiepileptic drug metabolism. The inverse effect is also frequent. A better knowledge of the spectrum of drugs that cause seizures or interfere with antiepileptic drugs metabolism is important for evaluation of appropriate treatment options and for guiding the choice of rational therapeutic procedures.",

Despite returning to baseline after several days to weeks, patients can suddenly decompensate, exhibiting what is called postictal psychosis despite being abstinent from the substance. This condition can lead to chronic psychosis if not properly treated. In this case, a male in his twenties, presented with 1 month of auditory hallucinations, visual hallucinations, and paranoid delusions. After his last cocaine use 1 month ago, the patient developed seizure-like activity and shortly after returned to baseline. Approximately 1 week later, the patient started to experience psychosis. Due to persistent symptoms, the patient was admitted and started on Risperidone 2mg twice a day but did not respond. Clonazepam 1mg twice a day was added, which helped patient to return to baseline. Cocaine induced postictal psychosis is underreported, and it can be difficult to recognize. Similarly, there are few guidelines as to how to treat this condition. Clinicians need to rapidly address if they suspect that the patient is experiencing possible postictal psychosis given that this can lead to chronic psychosis.",

      "abstract": "Le sommeil est un état physiologique et comportemental caractérisé par une isolation partielle de l'environnement. Lors du sommeil, un événement perturbateur comme la douleur peut provoquer une réaction de microéveil brève et inconsciente vers un réveil comportemental caractérisé par une réactivation thalamocorticale complète et un niveau plus élevé de conscience. Le sommeil devient alors fragmenté et les plaintes de douleur se trouvent souvent exacerbées. La continuité oscillatoire de 90–110 minutes, rythme ultradien du sommeil léger et profond (non-REM: rapid eye movement) vers le sommeil paradoxal (REM), est alors rompue. Chez un patient souffrant de céphalée, on observe trois périodes durant lesquelles surviennent les crises en relation avec le sommeil: 1) dans les heures avant l'initiation du sommeil, 2) durant et, 3) après le sommeil. La céphalée de tension et la migraine, la céphalée de type hypnique, l'algie vasculaire de la face (cluster headache) et l'hémicrânie paroxystique chronique peuvent survenir en relation avec le sommeil. Soulignons que la céphalée du réveil est parfois associée à du bruxisme (serrement et grincement des dents), à un abus de médications antalgiques, à de l'hypertension, à un trouble de l'humeur ou à des réductions du flux respiratoire lors du sommeil. Les céphalées suite à un traumatisme crânien sont fréquentes et causent de l'insomnie, des réveils subits et prématurés et surtout des matins pénibles avec délai de phase circadienne. Dans le contexte d'une céphalée survenant en relation avec l'insomnie ou la somnolence diurne, la recherche de troubles respiratoires du sommeil, d'intrusions sous forme de mouvements périodiques des membres ou de bruxisme est indiquée. La polygraphie peut être effectuée en laboratoire ou en ambulatoire. La gestion de ces céphalées suit les grands principes de la médecine contemporaine tout en visant une hygiène du sommeil maximale par thérapie cognitive et comportementale, le maintien d'un rythme circadien idéal, la prise de mélatonine, la correction du phénomène respiratoire. La prise d'hypnotique ne semble pas un traitement de choix à long terme.",

The causes of postoperative emergence delirium are not yet clear. Because there are many predisposing and precipitating risk factors of emergence delirium, it is difficult to prevent completely. We experienced a case of emergence delirium which could not be controlled with propofol, midazolam and fentanyl, but improved with haloperidol, the antipsychotic agent.",

      "title": "Lethal catatonia complicated by the development of neuroleptic malignant syndrome in a middle-aged female",
      "abstract": "Lethal catatonia and neuroleptic malignant syndrome are both rare and life-threatening problems. The clinical presentations are very similar, with striking features of altered mental status, fevers, and muscle rigidity. Lethal catatonia is a neuropsychiatric disorder that was first described in the early 1800s, 100 yrs before the use of neuroleptics and other antipsychotic agents. Presently, it appears that this disorder may be an extension and terminal event of excited catatonia. Modern psychopharmacologic practice has almost eliminated this lethal progression. This syndrome is most commonly associated with underlying psychiatric pathology, but may rarely be associated with organic disease. Severe hyperthermia is one of the most striking changes that occurs with lethal catatonia along with a wide spectrum of abnormal behavior, including severe lability of mood, anorexia, bizarre behavior, hallucinations, mutism, catatonia, and muscle rigidity. Hyperthermia may culminate in death secondary to dehydration, end-organ failure, and cardiovascular collapse if it is unrecognized or refractory to therapy. Therapy consists of aggressive supportive therapy, antipsychotic agents, and, on occasion, electroconvulsive therapy (1). The neuroleptic malignant syndrome is an uncommon, but severe, adverse reaction to antipsychotic and neuroleptic medications. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is characterized by high fever, muscle rigidity, autonomic dysfunction, and an alteration in the level of consciousness. Patients frequently have increased WBC counts and serum creatinine phosphokinase (CPK) concentrations. Neuroleptic malignant syndrome is reported to have a mortality rate of approximately 20%. The syndrome is a diagnosis of exclusion and must be differentiated from lethal catatonia, infectious etiologies, central nervous system pathology, malignant hyperthermia, toxic encephalopathy, hyperthyroidism, tetany, parkinsonism, and drug overdose or toxin ingestion (2–5). We present a patient who developed lethal catatonia, which was initially, successfully treated with an antipsychotic drug. However, the patient subsequently developed neuroleptic malignant syndrome. The diagnostic dilemma and therapeutic challenges of this clinical situation are reviewed.",

      "title": "Experience with Drugs and Driving in Queensland, Australia",
      "abstract": "The effect of any one psychoactive drug on an individual is a function of its interaction with that individual; for this reason, the effect upon one person may not be the same as on another person. When two or more drugs are given at the same time, their effect may be one of antagonism, synergism or potentiation. The effects of a psychotropic drug (ataxia, incoordination, altered level of consciousness or awareness, disturbances of vision and increased reaction time) must surely impair the skills required for safe driving. Many prescribed drugs acting principally on the central nervous system are capable of impairing driving performance: analgesics, anti-depressants, anti-convulsants, sedatives, hypnotics, narcotics and tranquillizers. Other prescribed drugs: anti-histamines, hypotensive agents, hypoglycaemic substances may produce undesirable side effects which impair driving performance. In Queensland if breath analysis indicated a BAC too low to account for a driver's behaviour, a doctor is called to examine the driver, and samples of blood and urine are forwarded to a central laboratory. If the blood concentration of a drug equals or exceeds the accepted therapeutic level of the particular substance, the driver is considered to be under the influence of the drug. The most dangerous period is during the initial stage of taking a prescribed drug. Psychotropic drugs taken in prescribed dosage may initially produce drowsiness, ataxia, impaired judgement and increased reaction time. After a period of time, tolerance to the drug develops, with marked reduction in unwanted side effects. The most common drugs include morphine, pethidine, methadone, methaqualone, benzodiazepines, and barbiturates. The common purpose for such abuse is to get high -a stage of unreality characterized by euphoria and/or hallucinations, either visual or auditory or both. Intoxication by any of these drugs produces severe impairment of driving skills. An exaggerated pharmacological effect commonly occurs when alcohol is taken at the same time as another psychoactive drug. Benzodiazepines are the prescribed drug most commonly involved in instances of driving impairment, both alone and in combination with alcohol. Some drugs commonly associated with impaired driving performance are: mandrax, methadone and diazepam. The extent of the contribution of drivers impaired by drugs and drug-alcohol interaction to traffic accidents has not yet been defined. It will not be defined until all countries enact effective legislation to enable such drivers to be identified. The use of alcohol and psychotropic drugs in Australia has been increasing steadily over the past few years, and continues to increase. It is impossible to obtain accurate figures on the consumption of psychotropic drugs in Australia. (Shortened Author Abstract/TRRL)",

The wide variety of seemingly unrelated independent stereotypies generated by central stimulants is also puzzling. In rodents, for instance, drugs such as apomorphine and amphetamine have been reported to elicit climbing, jumping, rearing, prancing, running, walking, circling, revolving, pivoting, gnawing, licking, nose-poking, sniffing, verticalization, side-to-side head and paw movements, backward locomotion, and underwater swimming without surfacing (e.g. Alander etal.1983; Cole 1977; Costall and Naylor 1973; Decsi et al.1979; Fray et al.1980; Janssen et al.1960; Jerussi and Glick 1976; Kokkinidis and Anisman 1979; Schijljrring 1971; Schoenfeld et al.1975; Segal et al.1980; Szechtman et al.1982; Teitelbaum 1986; Thomas and Handley 1978; Voigtlander eta/.1975).

      "title": "Iloperidone (Fanapt): An FDA-Approved Treatment Option for Schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a debilitating and chronic mental illness that affects approximately 24 million people of all ages around the world. The usual onset is between 15 and 35 years of age,1 and about 1% of all Americans are affected.2 Approximately 25% of all beds in psychiatric hospitals are occupied by patients with schizophrenia, and 50% of psychiatric hospital admissions are a result of schizophrenia.3,4 This mental illness can be characterized by the presentation of psychosis, cognitive impairment, social withdrawal, and apathy, all of which lead to impaired functioning in school, self-care, recreational activities, work, parenting, and interpersonal relationships. Among the psychiatric disorders, schizophrenia is considered to be the most disabling illness.5 Symptoms can broadly be classified into three groups: \r\n\r\n\r\npositive: unusual perceptions or thoughts such as hallucinations and delusions\r\n\r\n\r\nnegative: a decrease or loss in the ability to speak, to find pleasure in everyday life, to express emotions, or to initiate plans. These symptoms are often mistaken for depression or amotivation; hence they are more difficult to recognize.\r\n\r\n\r\ncognitive: difficulty in organizing or planning, with impairments in executive functioning, working memory, and attention. These are considered the most disabling of the symptoms because they affect the patient’s ability to maintain a normal life.6\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo general classes of medications are used to treat schizophrenia: first-generation (conventional) antipsychotic agents and second-generation (atypical) antipsychotic agents.\r\n\r\nThe most commonly used first-generation antipsychotic drugs are chlorpromazine (Thorazine, GlaxoSmithKline), haloperidol (Haldol, Ortho-McNeil), perphenazine (Trilafon, Schering), and fluphenazine (Prolixin, Apothecon). Although efficacious, these medications are associated with a high risk of causing extrapyramidal symptoms, including rigidity, tremors, dystonia, and restlessness.\r\n\r\nIn 1990, the first of the atypical agents, clozapine (Clozaril, Novartis), was approved in the U.S. Although clozapine is considered to have extrapyramidal symptoms as a rare side effect, it carries five black box warnings, the most serious being agranulocytosis. Many other atypical agents are known for their metabolic side effects such as weight gain and an increased risk of hyperglycemia and hyperlipidemia. Other atypical antipsychotic medications include risperidone (Risperdal, Janssen), olanzapine (Zyprexa, Eli Lilly), quetiapine (Seroquel, AstraZeneca), ziprasidone (Geodon, Pfizer), aripiprazole (Abilify, Bristol-Myers Squibb/Otsuka), paliperidone (Invega, Janssen), and asenapine (Saphris, Schering-Plough).6\r\n\r\nIn May 2009, the FDA approved iloperidone (Fanapt, Vanda) as an atypical antipsychotic agent for the acute treatment of patients with schizophrenia. In clinical trials, it was shown to be efficacious and safe. In this article, we review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of iloperidone in alleviating both the positive and negative symptoms of this disabling disease.",

      "abstract": "A recently proposed diagnostic class, psychotic trigger reaction, is deduced from careful clinical studies of eight white men, who upon a very specific trigger stimulus committed murder or attempted to (and in one case also rape). The new class is defined as a sudden ego-alien, motiveless (at least with respect to aggression), motor-wise well organized, violent complex action without emotional concomitants. The action is evoked (not provoked) by an individually unique stimulus within a specific context reviving repeated past traumatic experience. Typically there is no (significant) loss of consciousness and practically full recall. Observed are first-time hallucinations (visual, auditory, tactile, somesthetic, but not olfactory as in temporal lobe epilepsy) and signs of imbalance in the autonomic nervous system (loss of bladder control, ejaculation, profuse sweating, nausea). Only four of these men had previous psychiatric diagnoses (and then various ones) or abnormal EEGs at some time in their lives. Variety in prior diagnoses would be consistent with a seizure-like disorder, here specifically implicating an imbalance in functioning between limbic and frontal lobe systems. Clinical tests for the latter were prevailingly indicative of dysfunctioning. A detailed clinical analysis of the violent acts within their context suggests behaviors are analogous to certain limbic system mechanisms, especially the kindling phenomenon.",

Se caracteriza por una capacidad reducida para razonar y comprender informacion abstracta o compleja, que tiene un fuerte impacto en el aprendizaje escolar y limita la capacidad de adaptacion en la vida diaria, incluso en la edad adulta. La discapacidad intelectual, o discapacidad mental, es el resultado de una interaccion de la vulnerabilidad individual de una persona que tiene DI con su ecosistema, es decir, el entorno familiar, cultural o institucional que puede ser un obstaculo o un facilitador. La deteccion de un nino con una trayectoria de desarrollo inusual requiere un buen conocimiento del desarrollo psicomotor por parte de los profesionales. La DI puede estar aislada, pero tambien es muy frecuente que aparezca asociada a otros trastornos del neurodesarrollo, como autismo, trastornos motores o sensoriales (audicion, vision), trastornos graves del sueno, de la alimentacion, o patologias medicas como la epilepsia, o una amplia variedad de trastornos psicopatologicos como ansiedad, depresion y trastornos de la regulacion emocional. Las causas de la DI son multiples, y mas de una de cada dos veces son de origen genetico, existiendo varios centenares de enfermedades raras que pueden estar detras de su origen, pero es frecuente aun que sus causas sean desconocidas. La difusion de las nuevas tecnicas geneticas (secuenciacion de alto rendimiento) deberia reducir el numero de personas sin diagnosticar y devolver su lugar a un enfoque diagnostico razonado basado en la clinica. La evaluacion periodica y multidimensional de las competencias cognitivas, escolares, socioemocionales y adaptativas a lo largo de la vida permite comprender mejor el funcionamiento de las personas con una DI y prever estrategias adecuadas de aprendizaje, tratamiento, acompanamiento y apoyo para una mejor calidad de vida y participacion en la vida de la sociedad.",

      "abstract": "Smell and taste disorders can be challenging to diagnose because of the large number of potential etiologies. Patients are often unable to provide a clear history of symptoms, because they frequently cannot distinguish between difficulties with smell and taste. Standardized questionnaires may be helpful in diagnosis. Smell and taste dysfunction have been implicated in loss of appetite, unintended weight loss, malnutrition, and reduced quality of life. Taste dysfunction may be complete or partial, and affect one or more aspects of taste (sweetness, bitterness, sourness, saltiness, and umami [savory]). An estimated 95% of taste disorders are caused by impairment of smell rather than gustatory loss. The most common causes of olfactory dysfunction include allergic rhinitis, chronic rhinosinusitis (with or without sinonasal polyps), and upper respiratory infection. Other potential causes include head trauma, neurodegenerative diseases (including Parkinson disease and cognitive impairments), and medications. Examination of the nose, mouth, and oropharynx as well as neurologic examination (focusing on cranial nerves I, VII, IX, and X) is essential. Additional assessment such as cognitive testing, nasal endoscopy, computed tomography of the sinuses or nose, or brain magnetic resonance imaging may be indicated. Up to one-half of patients with olfactory dysfunction improve over time. Improvement in olfactory function is inversely correlated with severity and duration of loss, age, smoking, and male sex.",

Symptoms and complaints could be misinterpreted. Differential diagnostic assessments would be difficult either if the person has OCD or another diagnostic entity with OCD related symptoms. If clinicians in residential or outpatient settings do not realize this, the patients may suffer from inadvertent pharmacological treatment efforts, to no avail. A representative case of the former is presented. Withdrawal of all psychotropic medications cold turkey did not increase symptom load during the following weeks, indicating little benefit from medications. Because of continued complaints from the patient, psychotropic medications were gradually reintroduced, without any improvement. OCD patients may not be helped by extensive use of psychotropics and doctors responsible for them should employ other methods of reducing OCD symptoms than lumping together diverse psychotropics. There is evidence for the value of intensive cognitive behaviour therapy, but also for addressing the social conditions of the patients.",

In this paper, the author describes the clinical steps in the differential diagnosis of insomnia symptoms for readers who are not specialized in sleep medicine. When patients complain of insomnia symptoms, physicians first need to check their sleep habits and optimize them if they are inappropriate and interfere with good sleep. Medical history and medication use should also be reviewed in the first step because some medical conditions (e.g., articular diseases, skin diseases, cardiopulmonary disorders) and medications (e.g., steroids, interferon, methyldopa, levodopa) can cause insomnia symptoms. Insomnia symptoms can be caused by a variety of sleep disorders other than insomnia disorders, such as obstructive sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, periodic limb movement disorder, and delayed sleep-wake phase disorder. A diagnosis of insomnia disorder is given only if the insomnia symptoms cannot be fully explained by another sleep disorder.",

The typical symptoms of shunt failure such as headache, nausea, vomiting, lethargy, irritability, mental status changes, behavioural disturbances are unspecific and sometimes minimal. Headache as the commonest symptom of shunt dysfunction has various other aetiologies; a first episode of migraine is especially difficult to differentiate from shunt failure. Nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain might also be related to gastroenteritis and consecutive dehydration might provoke symptoms of over drainage. Both, over drainage or infection can mimic the symptoms of drainage failure. Seizures as a warning sign are rare; but epilepsy as a comorbidity frequent. Neurological examination, although very important is not always very informative: papilledema and other signs of pressure develop only over time.

A neural network is described, including the alterations of neuroactive substances at specific subreceptors. Currently, major depression is treated with monoamine reuptake inhibitors.

      "abstract": "Chronic constipation is one of the most frequent symptoms encountered by physicians in their daily clinical practice. This symptom may be broadly subdivided into primary (so-called 'idiopathic' or 'functional') constipation and secondary constipation; the latter is associated with endocrine, metabolic and neurological disorders (e.g., hyperparathyroidism, diabetes mellitus, Parkinson's disease), luminal obstruction (e.g., colon neoplasms) and use of drugs (e.g., anticholinergics and opioids) [1]. Here, we will focus on some known etiologic factors underlying primary constipation. The definition of constipation varies greatly according to the descriptor (layman, patient, physician, researcher), and several definitions are available in the literature; definitions not always overlapping. However, the two main aspects on which there is ample agreement is that constipation is characterized by a reduction (up to absence) of bowel movements and/or frequent (conventionally defined as at least a quarter of the occasions) difficult expulsion of stools (straining at stools) [1]. It is worth noting that these two aspects also broadly define the two main subtypes of chronic constipation, represented by slow-transit constipation (STC) and obstructed defecation (OD) [1].",

      "abstract": "The term \"depression\" is used to describe a normal mood, a medical symptom, and a collection of psychiatric symptoms. As a normal mood, depression is a common human reaction to a significant loss; as a medical term, it is also used to describe the sadness seen in patients who have other severe medical and psychiatric disorders. Most often, however, \"depression\" refers to a group of psychiatric syndromes or illnesses with well defined symptoms only one of which is sadness. Depression syndromes are probably universal. There are accounts of depressive illness throughout history from almost every human society. The universality of depressive illness is also reflected in the frequency of depression as a theme of the world's great literature. Studies of the biochemical correlates of psychotic depression have focused on two major hypotheses. The first proposes that affective disorders result from functional changes in the central noradrenergic systems. The second postulates that the primary abnormality is in central serotonergic pathways. These two hypotheses are supported by the pharmacological effects of antidepressant drugs.",

      "abstract": "The Landau-Kleffner syndrome consists in the association of an aphasia acquired during childhood or adolescence after a period of normal development, accompanied by epileptic fits and, sometimes, psychological disturbances. The appearance of the symptoms may not be simultaneous. The nature of this syndrome has been widely discussed and even the possibility of being a non-unitary syndrome has been considered. It may be possibly due to diverse etiologies, genetic or acquired (infectious). The relation between the aphasic, the psychologic and the convulsive symptoms has also raised controversies. A case of a female is described in which the psychological symptomatology was so severe, she had to be admitted in a psychiatric unit. The symptoms consisted in agitation during the night and severe persistent insomnia so as difficulties for relationship during day. No abnormalities were detected in a TAC nor in a RM but electroencephalographic and neuropsychological abnormalities were detected. The epileptic fits disappeared with a carbamacepine treatment but the rest of symptoms remained even more accentuated. After her admission, a treatment with valproate achieved to control her fits and the aphasic symptoms and neuropsychological deficits were compensated in the course of several months. After a year of treatment the patient's life was normalized, she resumed her studies, the EEG abnormalities disappeared so as the psychological disturbances and the behavior problems with the exception of phobic symptoms, similar to the ones of other family members. The patient has a history of epilepsy on its mother's side. The evolution and treatment response suggests that at least in some cases of the Landau-Kleffner syndrome, the etiology of the aphasia and other neuropsychological deficits and of the behavior disorders are related with some subclinical epileptic discharges and with a \"functional inhibition\" of some areas of the nervous system.",

      "abstract": "Introduction. Long-time consumption of narcotics leads to altered mental status of the addict. It is also connected to damages of different organic systems and it often leads to ap- pearance of multiple organ failure. Excessive narcotics con- sumption or abuse in a long time period can lead to various consequences, such as atraumatic rhabdomyolysis, acute renal failure and electrolytic disorders. Rhabdomyolysis is charac- terized by injury of skeletal muscle with subsequent release of intracellular contents, such as myoglobin, potassium and cre- atine phosphokinase. In heroin addicts, rhabdomyolysis is a consequence of the development of a compartment syndrome due to immobilization of patients in the state of unconscious- ness and prolonged compression of extremities, direct heroin toxicity or extremities ischemia caused by intraluminal occlu- sion of blood vessels after intraarterial injection of heroin. Se- vere hyperkalemia and the development of acute renal failure require urgent therapeutic measures, which imply the applica- tion of either conventional treatment or a form of dialysis.

Delirium is usually temporary and reversible and does not reflect a persistent psychiatric disorder.1 Delirium may result from a general medical condition, from use of drugs or similar substances, or from withdrawal from these substances. Some researchers suggest that there are two forms of delirium: hyperactive (agitated) and hypoactive (lethargic). If individuals with delirium experience the hyperactive form, they may be more prone to hallucinations, delusions, agitation, and disorientation. The rate is higher in elderly persons, those with cancer, and those with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Patients who have had an operation (especially heart surgery, hip surgery, and organ transplants), as well as patients with burns, dialysis, or central nervous system lesions, are at increased risk for delirium. It is very common in individuals with terminal illnesses, often occurring just before death.4 we conducted this study to see the aetiological profile of Acute Confusional State in patients admitted in medical wards in IGMC Shimla and to study the behavior pattern of such patients.",

      "abstract": "Nighttime eating is categorized as either night eating syndrome (NES) or the sleep-related eating disorder (SRED). Both diseases are often connected with an increase of the body mass, obesity, and with psychiatric disturbances. NES is characterized by evening hyperphagia, abnormally increased food intake after the evening meal, nocturnal awakings with ingestions, morning anorexia, and insomnia. Patients suffering from NES are aware of their nocturnal ingestions. It is suggested that NES is an abnormality in the circadian rhythm of meal timing that occurs in people with normal circadian rhythm of sleep. Other factors underlying NES include genetic predispositions, hormonal and neurochemical disturbances, and mood disorders. SRED is characterized by recurrent episodes of eating or drinking after arousal from nighttime sleep, unaware in tight the most cases, with adverse consequences. The distinctive features of SRED are amnesia of night eating episodes and consumption of non-typical food or dangerous articles. SRED is frequently associated with other sleep disorders, e.g., restless leg syndrome, periodic limb movement disorder, obstructive sleep apnea, and somnambulism. It can be also induced by medicines applied by a patient (e.g. zolpidem). It is hypothesized that the syndrome represents a variation of somnambulism. In the treatment of NES both non-pharmacological methods (psychotherapy, phototherapy) as well as the pharmacotherapy (aimed to increase serotoninergic neurotransmission in the brain, predominantly by sertraline, a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor) are used. SRED can be treated by controlling comorbid sleep disorders and eliminating provocative sedative hypnotics.",

      "title": "Schizotypy, schizotypic psychopathology and schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "The term schizotypy refers to a latent personality organization that putatively harbors the liability for schizophrenia and can give rise to a variety of schizophrenia-related phenotypic outcomes1, 2. This personality organization, which is determined by any number of as-yet-unknown schizophrenia-related genetic influences acting against a background of polygenic assets and liabilities as well as impacts from the environment (e.g., stressors, epigenetic inputs), can manifest itself variously at the phenotypic level, ranging from clinically diagnosable schizophrenia through pathological personality manifestations (e.g., schizotypal, paranoid, avoidant and schizoid personality disorders) to subtle, sub-clinical psychotic-like phenomenology (e.g., perceptual aberrations, magical ideation, referential thinking, interpersonal aversiveness). Schizotypy may also manifest itself in an imperceptible manner, undetectable by the unaided naked eye, through deviance on endophenotypes that have established valid relations with schizophrenia. Moreover, schizotypy as a latent construct (personality organization) is centrally embedded in a diathesis-stressor theoretical model that has considerable utility as an organizing framework for the study of schizophrenia, schizophrenia-related psychopathology (e.g., delusional disorder, psychosis not otherwise specified, schizotypal, paranoid and other related personality disorders) as well as putative schizophrenia endophenotypes, a view I have advocated for several decades3-6. Note, the term schizotypy is not restricted to describe only those clinical manifestations that are associated with schizotypal personality disorder2, 5, 6. Nor is the term reserved to indicate a methodological preference, e.g. for self-report psychometric assessments. Rather, schizotypy can be assessed using a variety of approaches such as interviews, psychometric inventories, familial risk and/or laboratory measures. Schizotypic persons may indeed display some of the phenomenology associated with schizotypal personality disorder, but they may also show other features6-8. There is a long history of describing clinical states bearing the imprint of schizotypy and an implicit connection to schizophrenia liability, including observations by Kraepelin, Bleuler, Rado, Meehl, Gottesman and myself. It has been argued that a clear demarcation in an underlying schizophrenia liability continuum (e.g., a pronounced threshold effect or discontinuity) is required to explain the emergence of schizotypic indicators in psychological functioning. An alternative position regarding schizotypy holds that it is a dimension of normal personality, not necessarily connected to schizophrenia liability, and representing something of a \"healthy\" personality factor. However, observers of schizophrenia and schizotypic psychopathology, in the main, do not view schizotypy as benign or reflective of healthy psychological adjustment. Non-psychotic schizotypic states (defined using clinical, laboratory and/or familial risk) have been associated with a wide range of findings, including sustained attention deficits, working memory deficits, smooth pursuit eye movement dysfunction, schizophrenia-related psychometric deviance on the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), executive functioning deficits, dysfunctional anti-saccade performance, subtle formal thought disorder, clinical schizotypal and paranoid personality features, schizophrenia-related social cognition deficits, exteroceptive and proprioceptive somatosensory deficits, psychomotor abnormalities, and candidate polymorphisms (e.g., ZNF804A, Val158Met-COMT, neuregulin-1). That schizotypic persons manifest such a panorama of deficits, similar in nature albeit less in degree to those seen in schizophrenia, argues for a connection or common underlying construct for conditions defined phenotypically (i.e., schizotypic subjects vs. schizophrenia-affected subjects). An area of continued speculation concerns the underlying structure of schizotypy and the precise nature of the variation expressed in that latent construct. Considerable statistical evidence, using a variety of latent structure methods, points to the existence of possible underlying discontinuities or severe threshold effects in schizotypy, and work in this area continues. Such evidence stimulates the caveat, to wit, that the use of continuous measures to assess phenotypic manifestations of schizotypy does not ipso facto mean that the underlying (or latent) schizotypy construct is fully quantitative or uniformly graded by degree. The course and clinical outcome for those designated as harboring schizotypy remains an area of active inquiry. It is entirely conceivable that many individuals possessing schizotypy may traverse the life course escaping psychotic illness as well as other diagnosable schizotypic manifestations. The expectation that some people validly at risk for schizophrenia may never manifest the illness is well established in the reality of discordant monozygotic twins, in which one twin is affected by schizophrenia and the co-twin is not psychotic (perhaps not even diagnosable as having a non-psychotic, but detectable, clinical schizotypic condition like schizotypal or paranoid personality disorder). Individuals that achieve elevated scores on psychometric measures of schizotypy have been shown to be at increased risk for schizophrenia and schizophrenia-related psychoses later in life, as well as a variety of other related outcomes. Such individuals also display poorer psychosocial functioning, lower rates of marriage, increased use of psychiatric medications, and increased utilization of psychiatric services2. It is entirely conceivable that many individuals designated as \"prodromal\" for schizophrenia, but who do not convert to schizophrenia (which is 60-70% of such subjects), are in fact harboring schizotypy and will, even if not psychotic, show impairments across the life span, perhaps adopting an eccentric or odd manner of personality functioning. The schizotypy model has helped to adjust the boundaries of schizophrenia phenotype in the DSM-5 (e.g., schizotypal pathology is now included with schizophrenia). Furthermore, illuminating the nature of schizotypy may aid in unraveling the current puzzle of the very low conversion to schizophrenia rates seen in \"prodromal\" schizophrenia research9. Finally, I have argued that the schizotypy framework may be useful in understanding configurations (rather than simple additive summation) of genes relevant to schizophrenia variants2, an idea that is beginning to gain traction. There is no doubt that incorporation of schizotypy indicators into genomic studies of schizophrenia increase their statistical power. The advantages of a cleaner unit of analysis (the schizotype), free from the effects of medication, institutionalization and neurocognitive decline, are axiomatic. However, the understanding (and misunderstanding) of the schizotypy model as well as alternative approaches to the construct require vigilance, in order to ensure that the approach continues to yield the fruit that it can.

They are often caused by delirium, especially if there has been a rapid change in the patient's state of health. Hypoactive delirium in particular is difficult to recognize in the dementia setting. Acute somatic diseases bear a different meaning in dementia than in non-dementia patients, and priorities must be given to the impaired cerebral performance. In addition to medical decisions, ethical ones need to be made. Special attention should be paid to the resources of the caregiver network. This article describes both non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatment modalities when dealing with emergencies in dementia patients. Häufige Notfälle bei Demenzerkrankten sind Aggressivität, Schreien, Tag-Nacht-Umkehr, sonstige Verhaltensstörungen und Stürze. Ursache ist nicht selten ein Delir, vor allem wenn es zu einer raschen Änderung gekommen ist. Besonders hypoaktive Delirien sind schwer zu erkennen. Akute somatische Erkrankungen haben bei Dementen eine andere Bedeutung als bei Nicht-Dementen, Prioritäten müssen der Hirnleistungsschwäche angepasst werden. Neben medizinischen müssen auch ethische Entscheide gefällt werden. Besondere Bedeutung kommt den Ressourcen des Betreuernetzes zu.

      "abstract": "Introduccion. Fernando VI fue rey de Espana entre 1746 y 1759. Su ultimo ano de reinado se conoce como el ano sin rey. Durante ese ano, el monarca sufrio un rapido empeoramiento de sus condiciones mentales. La enfermedad generalmente ha sido atribuida a una condicion psiquiatrica primaria, generalmente por un trastorno bipolar. Desarrollo. Se realiza un estudio de investigacion en los archivos documentales espanoles y bibliotecas en busca de informacion clinica sobre la enfermedad de Fernando VI. Se realiza una evaluacion y discusion clinica de la enfermedad del rey sobre la base de la informacion obtenida. Conclusiones. El inicio del empeoramiento clinico del ultimo ano de Fernando VI empezo tras la muerte de su amada esposa. Los sintomas iniciales descritos pueden ser similares a los de un episodio depresivo mayor, sin embargo, el monarca sufrio un empeoramiento rapidamente progresivo con alteraciones de la personalidad, conductuales, encamamiento, perdida de control de esfinteres y crisis epilepticas. Los ultimos meses de su vida estuvo en un estado de postracion con un estado cognitivo compatible con una demencia grave. Por todo ello, aunque es posible que Fernando VI pudiera padecer previamente algun tipo de trastorno psiquiatrico, la enfermedad que le llevo a su muerte precoz seria compatible con lo que hoy conocemos como una demencia rapidamente progresiva.",

Psilocybin and psilocin are the active compounds, responsible for the hallucinogenic effects and are a part of the substance group, derived from tryptamine and characterized by an indole nucleus. We report a clinical case observed in an emergency unit and review the historical, epidemiological and pharmacological data now available for these intoxications. Of particular interests in hallucinogenic mushroom abuse are: increased consumption in the context of youth cultural and entertainment movements; possible difficulties in the diagnosis in emergency conditions; possibility of severe and fatal complications.",

These modalities include physical restraint (hand/ankle cuffing, prone positioning, application of pressure on the torso and/or limbs, maximal prone restraint, application of conducted electrical weapons) and chemical restraints (lacrimal agents/chemical irritants) in the setting of psychotic illness/agitation, struggle/physical exertion, intoxication with stimulant drugs and underlying cardiovascular pathology that can predispose to sudden death. Assessment of these case are often not straightforward, and their certification can be some of the most difficult cases that a forensic pathologist can be faced with in respect to the determination of both cause manner of death. Perceived unfair and/or unpopular certifications of these cases can result in professional criticism, allegations of bias, complicity or bias by certifying pathologist, social dissatisfaction/unrest and violent public protests. Recent deaths in custody in the United States (US) are typical examples of this phenomenon. This Chapter outlines the main clinicopathologic considerations that must occur in the pathologic assessment of these cases",

      "title": "Palliative sedation: welcome guidance on a controversial issue",
      "abstract": "Palliative sedation (PS) is the use of medications to reduce consciousness for the relief of intolerable and refractory symptoms, in patients with limited life expectancy. The ethical justification of palliative sedation is based upon the principles of double effect, autonomy and proportionality. Double effect is predicated upon the primary intent being to relieve suffering, despite potential foreseeable, but unintended, adverse effects. Proportionality is based upon the use of PS in the face of intolerable distress as a ‘therapy of last resort’, when all other potentially less harmful options have been expended or are inappropriate. PS is neither slow euthanasia nor physician-assisted suicide. Both of these practices involve the specific intent to end life, the deliberate use of lethal doses of sedation drugs, or non-therapeutic escalation of doses disproportionate to symptom distress. PS does not shorten life overall (when implemented in specialist palliative care units), despite the expected risk of individual complications (e.g. respiratory or hemodynamic compromise, aspiration, or venous thromboembolism). Sedative drugs first appeared in modern medicine in the 19th century, with bromide and chloral hydrate. Barbiturates were introduced in 1903, and benzodiazepines in 1959. The first descriptions of sedation for symptom control in advanced disease were published in 1990–1991. The early literature described a wide range in prevalence, indications and clinical practices. The prevalence in these reports ranged from 16% to over 50%. Indications included agitation and restlessness, pain, delirium, respiratory distress, myoclonus, and psychological symptoms. Drugs used for sedation included benzodiazepines, antipsychotics and barbiturates. Despite a number of prospective studies and published guidelines, evidence upon which to base practice has remained limited and controversial issues persist. These include almost every aspect of PS; the definition and terminology (palliative versus terminal), the types of sedation included under this term (intermittent versus continuous, light versus deep), the indications (physical or existential distress), the use of artificial hydration and nutrition, and the ethical basis and differentiation from euthanasia. Decisions about palliative sedation are complex and can have significant implications for the patient and lasting impact on family and staff. Staff need to develop awareness of their own preferences about care of the dying, and the potential role of frustration, sense of failure and burnout in decision making. Individual physician personal and professional factors may influence the practice of PS, including prevalence, determination of refractoriness, level of sedation used, and drugs employed. Families and staff need extensive support to understand the decision-making process, and be clear about the goals and expected outcomes. Identifying a family spokesperson (preferably one chosen by the patient) may help communication, especially for large, geographically scattered or conflicted families. Without effective communication families may be left with feelings of profound confusion, guilt or remorse, which complicate their subsequent bereavement. For these reasons evaluation and decision making by a multidisciplinary team skilled in palliative care is essential prior to initiating PS. Initiating PS without palliative medicine involvement is potentially hazardous. Palliative medicine consultation has been demonstrated to elicit previously undocumented diagnoses (especially delirium), and suggest multiple management strategies in advanced cancer, even within tertiary cancer centers. A dilemma in decision making arises where there is a lack of access to, or awareness of, specialized interventions including palliative medicine, psychiatry, interventional pain management, and spiritual care. Non-palliative medicine physicians need to have insight into their own therapeutic limitations, whilst palliative medicine physicians should be available to provide support via telephone or videoconference to isolated clinicians.",

      "title": "A Case of Forgotten Poisoning in a Patient Presenting with Speech Disorder",
      "abstract": "Anticholinergic poisoning is one of the most common causes of poisoning in the emergency department. Beautiful hawthorn (atropa belladonna), which is found in our country, is one of the plants that can cause anticholinergic syndrome. It is important in the differential diagnosis in cases progressing with general status disorder and loss of consciousness and psychotic findings. The onset of anticholinergic intoxication varies depending on the toxin and occurs within one to two hours following oral ingestion. The diagnosis of anticholinergic poisoning is based on clinical findings. Anticholinergic poisoning is easily diagnosed when a history of exposure to an anticholinergic substance is obtained and the patient shows altered mental status, delirium or hallucinations. However, in cases with no history and unknown exposure, the diagnosis of anticholinergic intoxication is considered when clinical signs and symptoms caused by mental status disorder and anticholinergic effects are detected on physical examination. A 75-year-old woman was admitted to the emergency department with complaints of slurred speech, altered consciousness and facial shifting that started about 2 hours ago. On physical examination, the patient was incoopere and disoriented, GCS:12 eyes were spontaneously open, obeying orders but making unintelligible sounds, nuchal rigidity was suspiciously positive, bilateral babinski reflex was positive. On admission vital signs were blood pressure 144/72 mmHg, pulse 98/min, temperature 37 °C, SO2 94%, fingerstick blood glucose 104 mg/dl and ECG was in normal sinus rhythm. There were no acute pathologic findings on both brain CT and brain MR imaging. In the control physical examination, both pupils were mydriatic, IR -/- and the patient had dry mouth. According to the anamnesis obtained from another relative of the patient, it was learned that they ate spinach in the evening and speech disorder started afterwards. The patient was diagnosed with anticholinergic intoxication considering that the spinach eaten by the patient with clinical findings might have been mixed with the beautiful hawthorn weed. In this case report, we aimed to emphasize the importance of detailing the anamnesis and the necessity of a complete systemic examination in patients presenting with confusion and speech disorder.",

Dentre as capacidades afetadas, a memória é a principal vítima desta condição. Outras capacidades também podem ser acometidas, tais como a linguagem, habilidade visuespacial, o cálculo, o discernimento e a resolução de problemas. Uma das causas da síndrome demêncial é a hidrocefalia normobárica (HNB), a qual afeta principalmente pessoas idosas, sendo possivelmente resultado de algum trauma ou doença, ainda que as causas exatas não estejam totalmentes claras. Esta pode ser apresentada com a clássica tríade: distúrbio de marcha (atáxica ou apráxica), demência e incontinência urinária e, é definida pelo acúmulo do líquido cefalorraquidiano (LCR ou líquor) nas cavidades ventriculares cranianas. O LCR banha o cérebro e a medula espinhal tendo como uma de suas finalidades a de evitar que possíveis traumas atinjam e comprometam o funcionamento adequado do sistema nervoso central (SNC). O diagnóstico dessa doença pode ser difícil e, muitas vezes ser confundido com outras patologias como o mal de Parkinson e o Alzheimer, além disso, o quadro clínico destas doenças podem estar sobrepostos e, muitas vezes, pacientes tratados para HNB podem estar sofrendo também de outra condição. O presente trabalho visa discutir o caso clínico de uma paciente de 73 anos diagnosticada e tratada cirurgicamente para hidrocefalia, abordando os sinais e sintomas, diagnósticos diferenciais e as melhorias na qualidade de vida após realização do adequado tratamento cirúrgico.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Under certain conditions, information may become stressful. In the initial stages of our research we found that informational stress can result in fatigue, anxiety, sleeplessness, and excitability. Later we found further symptoms, such as tachycardia, palpitations, chest pain, abdominal pain, increase or decrease of appetite, diarrhoea or constipation, muscle cramps, back pain, headache, tremor, dizziness, diaphoresis, tics, and so on. Some of these symptoms might be the result of cathecholamine increased secretion, others of a decrease of endogenous opioids. Because in the initial stage of stress analgesia may occur, we studied the clinical and experimental evolution of the pain threshold and its clinical manifestations. We found that after the initial analgesia, there follows a stage of hyperalgesia; the symptoms of this stage very much resemble those of the opioid abstinence syndrome. The evolution of this syndrome is enhanced by naloxone, an opioid antagonist, and it is attenuated by clonidine and propranolol, used in the treatment of opioid abstinence syndrome. Thus we demonstrated that in the latter stage of stress, there is diminished secretion of endogenous opioids and an acute tolerance to them.",

      "abstract": "Withdrawal syndrome after discontinuing serotonin re-uptake inhibitors, especially paroxetine, is largely unknown to most physicians. Variable incidence has been reported. Our aim was to stress the main clinical features of this syndrome. Serotonin re-uptake inhibitor withdrawal syndrome generally begins within 24 to 48 hours after discontinuing the drug. Signs reach their maximum on day 5 and usually resolve within 2 to 3 weeks. Withdrawal syndrome is more common with short half-life drugs (paroxetine, fluvoxamine). The intensity of the clinical signs depends on the daily dose and how long the drug has been given. The main signs are dizziness, vertigo, headache, nausea, and flu-like symptoms as well as anxiety, confusion, irritability, excessive dreaming and insomnia. Risk factors usually stressed are poor treatment compliance, previous withdrawal syndrome with another drug, concomitant medication and alcohol consumption. The syndrome can be prevented by tapering off the dose and patient education. When a withdrawal syndrome is present, it is advisable to reintroduce the drug then withdraw gradually.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a serious mental disorder. The diagnosis in patients who experience this disease is described as individuals who experience emotional or psychological problems that are out of control and display strange behavior and anger. One of the most common symptoms of schizophrenia is the appearance of hallucinations. The response caused by hallucinations is loss of self-control. The purpose of this study was to describe nursing care for Mrs. R with auditory hallucinations at Prof.Dr.MIldrem Hospital. In the case of Mrs. R, it was found that the client experienced hallucinatory symptoms such as hearing voices telling him to do negative things such as destroying things and getting angry and angry, anxious, sad, lacking eye contact, pacing, embarrassed and others. Predisposing factors in Mrs. R, that has experienced mental disorders before and did not regularly take medication and did not routinely go to the RSJ. The nursing diagnosis in the case of Mrs. R is auditory hallucinations, social isolation and self-care deficit. But in practice, it is focused on the problem of auditory hallucinations. Interventions are carried out by carrying out nursing actions and the implementation strategy is adjusted to the plan. The evaluation results obtained that there was an increase in the client's ability to control the hallucinations experienced and the impact on reducing the symptoms of auditory hallucinations experienced. Thus by implementing therapeutic communication in implementing meeting strategies 1-4 for clients with hallucinations, it can speed up the client's recovery process.",

      "abstract": "Principles of benzodiazepine selection are outlined for various psychiatric indications and diverse populations (the elderly, and drug and alcohol abusers). Benzodiazepines are still among the most commonly used classes of medications, and they differ in their pharmacodynamic properties. They have varied uses as monotherapy or as adjunctive medication because of their efficacy in the treatment of conditions involving a dysfunction of the GABAergic system or where neuronal inhibition is required. In multiple therapy, benzodiazepines augment the efficacy of other drugs such as lithium in mania, antipsychotics in psychotic agitation and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in panic disorder. Benzodiazepines can produce dependence and tolerance in most patients; predisposed individuals are at greater risk. Short- and intermediate-beta half-life compounds carry a greater risk of rebound and withdrawal reactions, and drug dependence than long acting agents. Adverse effects include sedation, psychomotor and cognitive impairment, memory loss, potentiation of other central nervous system depressants and treatment-emergent depression. Drug potency and beta elimination half-life are reviewed and compared as pharmacokinetic variables.",

      "title": "Opioids induced serotonin toxicity? Think again",
      "abstract": "Sir, In a recently published article, 'Cardiac arrest from tramadol and fentanyl combination' by Nair and Chandy,[1] the authors concluded this case to be the first ever report of serotonin toxicity due to the co-administration of fentanyl and tramadol. We argue against this diagnosis as the patient did not fall into the diagnostic criteria of serotonin syndrome. The diagnosis of serotonin toxicity remains clinical one, and no laboratory test confirms the same. It is a syndrome characterised by a triad of neuroexcitatory features (neuromuscular hyperactivity, tremor, clonus, hyper-reflexia, pyramidal rigidity), autonomic hyperactivity (diaphoresis, fever, tachycardia, tachypnoea), and altered mental status (agitation, excitement, confusion).[2] According to another commonly used 'Hunter's Serotonin Toxicity Criteria', at least one out of the following five clinical feature is required for the diagnosis of serotonin syndrome: Spontaneous clonus; inducible clonus with agitation or diaphoresis; ocular clonus with agitation or diaphoresis; tremors and hyper-reflexia; hypertonia, temperature above 38°C, and ocular or inducible clonus.[3] The patient in discussion had only agitation without any clonus, hyper-reflexia, or hyperthermia. Occurrence of ventricular tachycardia and subsequent fibrillation remain unexplained using any of the diagnostic criteria's of serotonin toxicity. The same review article[3] as quoted by the authors clearly mentions that both fentanyl and tramadol are weak serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) and rarely precipitate dose-dependent serotonin toxicity in conjunction with serotonergic medications and that too only if large doses of fentanyl or tramadol are used or in susceptible individuals.[3] The patient in discussion was not on any serotonergic medications and authors had injected only 0.83 μg/kg of fentanyl and over 1 mg/kg of tramadol. They deferred injecting additional doses of fentanyl with the fear of developing chest wall rigidity, which did not appear by that time. Wooden chest syndrome usually occurs at much higher doses of fentanyl (12–15 μg/kg in an adult), or when the drug is injected at a rapid rate.[4] Lack of classical clinical presentation, the absence of administration of large doses of opioids and drug interaction with SRIs, makes the diagnosis of serotonin syndrome unlikely.",

Hypersomnic patients should be referred to a neurologist for further diagnostic workup; hypnotics may be dangerous in these patients. Medical, psychiatric and other cases of hyposomnia should be identified and treated as part of a comprehensive therapy plan. Counselling and application of the rules of sleep hygiene should be considered. When drug therapy is indicated, benzodiazepines are preferable. Because chronic insomnia causes serious impairment to the quality of life, prolonged treatment with hypnotics is sometimes unavoidable. However, their long term efficacy remains to be demonstrated.",

Virtually pathogmonic symptoms include re-experiencing the event through play and ceaselessly repeated behaviors (re-enactments), cognitive distortions when relating the facts (chronological errors, belief in omens), changes in attitudes towards others and life in general, and neurovegetative hyperactivity (hypervigilance, startle responses, difficulties controlling impulses). Although adequate follow-up data are lacking, the disorder can probably become chronic in children, as in adults. This nosographic entity raises the theoretical issue of the roles of life events and individual vulnerability. A number of factors may either \"predispose\" or \"protect\" the child: degree and duration of exposure to the trauma, nature of the event, preexistence of psychiatric disorders, level of cognitive development, sex, degree of social support, and containing or noncontaining attitude of the family. Treatments advocated in adults (pharmacotherapy, cognitive and behavioral therapies, group therapy) remain to be used and evaluated in children.",

Insomnia is associated with many other medical problems ranging from depression to any issue that causes physical discomfort or pain. Insomnia may be associated with a specific set of environmental conditions or a chronic and unremitting problem that is either primary or associated with another medical problem. Treatment of an associated medical problem like pain improves sleep in some but not all cases. Conversely, treatment for insomnia may improve other medical outcomes. Primary insomnia seems to be related to inability to down regulate arousal and is frequently characterized by increased metabolic rate, heart rate, or other physiological markers. Some research has shown that insomnia may therefore be related to the development of hypertension and other disorders related to physiological arousal. Relatively little work has linked nutrition with insomnia. Beyond associations between caffeine or stimulant use and poor sleep, there is limited work linking poor nutrition with poor sleep and improved nutrition with better sleep.",

This leads to the release of large quantities of stress products (noradrenaline and its cognates) into the central nervous system (CNS), thus inducing a phase of depression of the cerebral cortex and other vulnerable parts of the CNS in such a way that the stupor analgesic stage is induced in the affected persons (called the \"syndrome of post-operative depression of vital functions\"). Treatment of such a syndrome thus involved removal of the stress products from the CNS as well as from peripheral circulation by extraction therapy (20% mannitol administration), coupled with judicious use of atropine and neostigmine to stimulate the CNS itself, i.e., the production of acetylcholine in the mesencephalic reticulo-activating system.",

      "title": "A boy with dissociative symptoms who benefited from biopsychosocial assessment",
      "abstract": "Dissociative disorder is defined in the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) as “a partial or complete loss of the normal integration between memories of the past, awareness of identity and immediate sensations, and control of bodily movements,” and its prevalence in children is as low as 1.30 per 100,000 population.1 We report a case of dissociative disorder secondary to a combination of psychosocial factors in addition to the developmental characteristics of the patient, both of which have been overlooked. A 9-year-old boy suddenly lost consciousness during class one day and received a diagnosis of suspected epilepsy at another hospital. One month later, during another class, he lost consciousness again after experiencing a tremor in his hands. A close examination revealed no abnormality, and the patient was thought to have suspected psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES). Various short-lived involuntary movements with impaired consciousness were often observed and gradually increased in frequency, and odd behavior was observed: When the subject of school or home came up, the child would suddenly become “spaced out,” scratch his face with his hands “like an animal,” and mimic “meow” for several tens of seconds, unable to communicate with staff. The neurologist re-examined the patient for neurological diseases including encephalitis, temporal lobe epilepsy as differential diagnoses. However, various laboratory tests and imaging studies were negative for organic diseases. The fact that positive symptoms appeared only during stress was also suggestive of nonorganic disease. Outpatient treatment was initiated in our department but the patient was admitted to the liaison department for biopsychosocial assessment because of frequent school absences and his mother's increasing fatigue due to difficulties in raising her child at home. During his hospitalization, we conducted a psychosocial assessment by interviewing his mother about his upbringing and developmental history, observing his behavior, and conducting psychological tests. The interviews revealed his rigid thought patterns and sensory sensitivity from early childhood, and the observations of his behavior revealed a lack of nonverbal communication, so we diagnosed him with autism spectrum disorder. The case formulation based on the assessment results is shown in Table 1. In terms of biology, predisposing factors included cognitive bias—the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children®-Fourth Edition (WISC®-IV) at age 7 years: total IQ, 90; verbal comprehension, 119; perceptual reasoning, 76; working memory, 79; processing speed, 86—and developmental characteristics, such as obsessiveness, sensory sensitivity, and poor communication skills. As psychological factors, the initial seizures and loss of consciousness were considered to have been induced by stress with classmates, such as feelings of inferiority. Because both seizures occurred during group work, when he was being helped by group members with a task he was having difficulty with. As a social factor, there was domestic discord between parents and between siblings. The school was also unaware of the cognitive characteristics and did not take them into consideration in his daily life and learning. The stressors that he experienced therefore included changes in learning difficulty and interpersonal relationships due to his promotion to the next grade. As a therapeutic intervention, risperidone was administered as a biological treatment for the irritability in autism spectrum disorder, and psychotherapy was conducted to explain the disease to the parents and the patient, and to encourage the patient to verbalize the disease. As social treatment, we provided parents with disease education and parent training according to their son's developmental characteristics. We also shared information with the school regarding the school's understanding of the child and reasonable accommodation, including symptoms caused by the child's developmental characteristics, necessary environmental adjustments, and involvement in school situations that would encourage verbalization. After explaining the findings to the patient and his family, the dissociative symptoms gradually resolved during the 2-week hospitalization, and the patient was discharged. Fortunately, his relationship with his family has improved, and he has been transferred to a special-needs class. In this case, “personality switching,” “detachment,” “loss of sense of reality,” and “dissociative convulsions” were present as dissociative symptoms. There have been few case reports of children with dissociative disorders secondary to autism spectrum disorders.2 It is possible that the prevalence of dissociative disorders is low and that many cases, such as the present case, go undiagnosed without adequate evaluation of developmental characteristics as background. The psychosocial factors of pediatric patients with PNES are numerous and complex3 and now that biopsychosocial assessment is mandatory. “Consultation liaison psychiatry” that links psychiatry and physical medicine and provides comprehensive medical care to patients is necessary.4 Although the clinical course and symptoms of this case were atypical and difficult to diagnose, a case formulation5 from a biopsychosocial perspective in collaboration with the liaison department and the neurology department clarified each of the complex overlapping factors, leading to the planning and implementation of an effective comprehensive treatment. Further development of pediatric consultation liaison psychiatry to enhance biopsychosocial assessment would be of great benefit. The authors declare no conflict of interest.

      "title": "High functioning male with fragile X syndrome and fragile X‐associated tremor/ataxia syndrome",
      "abstract": "Fragile X syndrome (FXS) affects individuals with more than 200 CGG repeats (full mutation) in the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. Those born with FXS experience cognitive and social impairments, developmental delays, and some features of autism spectrum disorders. Carriers of a premutation (55-200 CGG repeats) are generally not severely affected early in life; however, are at high risk of developing the late onset neurodegenerative disorder, Fragile X-associated Tremor/Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS), or Fragile X-associated Primary Ovarian Insufficiency (FXPOI), and may have other medical conditions such as developmental delay, autism spectrum disorders, hypertension, anxiety, and immune-mediated disorders. Here we present a case of a 58-year-old man with a borderline IQ, average memory skills, and executive function deficits. He met criteria for multiple psychiatric diagnoses and presented with tremor and ataxia, meeting criteria for FXTAS. Molecular testing unveiled a completely unmethylated FMR1 full mutation in peripheral blood mononucleated cells with elevated FMR1 mRNA and premutation alleles of different sizes in two other tissues (primary fibroblasts and sperm), indicating the presence of allele instability based on both inter- and intra-tissue mosaicism. The observation of FXTAS in this case of a full mutation mosaic man suggests that the pathogenic mechanism underlying this disorder is not observed exclusively in premutation carriers as it was originally thought. The concomitant presence of features of FXS and late onset neurological deterioration with probable FXTAS likely result from a combined molecular pathology of elevated FMR1 mRNA levels, a molecular hallmark of FXTAS and low FMRP expression that leads to FXS.",

From the day of deprivation – in the self-rating from the 4th day – up to 1 week later a therapeutic effect can be observed. The psychic part of the symptomatology was more reduced than the somatic one. Compared to total and partial SD during the 2nd half of the night, there is, on average, a smaller therapeutic effect which occurs later. The diurnal variation of the depressive symptomatology is less influenced. According to the period without sleep, the circadian course of the heart rate is less and differently modified by SD during the 1st half of the night. Only an existing diurnal variation (before SD) is a predictor of the prompt effect. Implications for the mechanism of the therapeutic SD were discussed. For clinical practice, SD during the 2nd half of the night is the method of choice.",

      "abstract": "Depression and dementia can lead to generalised cognitive and memory dysfunction. Thus, differentiating these disorders is important and challenging. Pseudodementia is a term used clinically to describe symptoms that resemble dementia but are caused by other conditions (most frequently depression), rather than being recognised as an official diagnosis. Pseudodementia is characterised by a cognitive impairment that mimics dementia but which does not have its origin in neurological degeneration, deriving instead from functional psychiatric conditions. This condition is more commonly observed in older adults (particularly those over the age of 50 or 60 years), and its risk factors overlap with those for depression. Pseudodementia is essentially characterised by deficits in memory, executive function and speech and, therefore, can easily be confused with dementia, although there are aspects that allow its differentiation. Diagnosing pseudodementia can be difficult, especially as there is significant overlap between its symptoms and those of other conditions. However, it is important to recognise characteristic aspects of this disorder, as its correct identification is essential for proper treatment.",

It was found that the closest relationship between the level of post-traumatic stress and psychopathological symptoms (anxiety, somatisation, interpersonal sensitivity, etc.) is observed in the case of delayed experience of a dangerous disease, which allows us to consider it as a special existential situation.",

      "abstract": "A very rare case is presented, when anxious sexual failure expectation syndrome in a male patient was manifested mostly in the form of a fear of libido decrease, the above fear being the real cause for that decrease. The fear appeared after one moment, when the patient noticed libido reduction. Some time later after that decrease he developed thoughts about a possible disturbance of erection, but the latter remained normal though it was not «swelling» like before the libido decrease (preclinical level). The author describes treatment of this patient with help of some psychotherapeutic methods: different cognitive techniques including the author’s method of «comparison by analogy», hypnosuggestive therapy in the variant of programming (using in particular the author’s formula of suggestions for increasing libido), the author’s modification of the «sway» technique that belongs to neurolinguistics programming. Pharmaceutical treatment (Hydazepamum, Trittico) was used too. During the treatment the patient developed a fear of becoming a homosexual, because his desire for women was reduced. It served as the cause for using cognitive manipulations and hypnosuggestive therapy as well as the above pharmacotherapy. The given treatment resulted in recovery. The above clinical observation demonstrates that in extraordinarily rare cases the libido decrease, which has already happened, can later lead to development of a fear of this decrease, this fear causing reduction of libido due to functioning of the semantic mechanism: what the patient is afraid of is realized.",

Patient's hallucinations appeared after duloxetine dose increased and disappeared after duloxetine stopped. Duloxetine-induced hallucinations cases have been reported following the use of the drug in a few case levels. The etiology may be due to dopaminergic increase through the serotonergic system. In addition, multiple drug use and the presence of additional medical illness may also increase the risk of hallucination due to the metabolic interaction of duloxetine with other drugs.",

      "abstract": "Caracterizada pela deficiência da enzima fenilalanina hidrolixase, a fenilcetonúria (PKU) apresenta-se com elevação sérica do aminoácido aromático fenilalanina (Phe) associado a prejuízo em formação de tirosina. Tanto o acúmulo de substrato quanto a falta do produto resultam em sintomas e sinais clínicos, principalmente relacionados ao desenvolvimento neuropsicomotor com atraso global, hipotonia, crises epilépticas quando não controlada de forma adequada. Além disso, nota-se elevada incidência de distúrbios neurocomportamentais em fenilcetonúricos, principalmente relacionados a condições de disfunção no córtex pré-frontal, como é o caso do transtorno do déficit de atenção e hiperatividade. Com finalidade de entendimento melhor sobre essas condições clínicas, realizado revisão bibliográfica da literatura atual para avaliar a associação entre TDAH e fenilcetonúricos, bem como suas incidências, entendimento de suas bases fisiopatológicas, sintomatológicas clínicas, tratamento e impactos gerais. Notou-se importante relação entre ambas, com aumento da prevalência de TDAH em pacientes com PKU. O controle dietético com manutenção dos níveis séricos de Phe em faixa terapêutica foi evidenciado como parte fundamental para melhores desempenhos neurocognitivos bem como redução importante em sintomas desatentos e hiperativos.",

      "title": "Emerging drugs for narcolepsy",
      "abstract": "Narcolepsy is characterised by excessive daytime sleepiness, usually associated with cataplexy, hypnagogic hallucinations, sleep paralysis and fragmented nocturnal sleep. Although uncommon, it results in significant disability. Most cases occur sporadically, but genetic factors probably form a susceptibility background on which unknown environmental triggers act. The hypocretin system is strongly implicated in the development of narcolepsy. Cerebrospinal fluid levels of hypocretin-1 are significantly reduced in narcoleptic subjects with cataplexy. Despite the advances in our understanding of narcolepsy, current therapy is primarily symptomatic. Stimulants (standard and novel) combat excessive daytime sleepiness. Antidepressants (tricyclics, dual-action or selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors) and sodium oxybate are anticataplexy agents. Hypnagogic hallucinations and sleep paralysis respond to antidepressants. Sodium oxybate consolidates sleep. Novel and experimental treatments include histamine antagonists, hypocretin agonists, slow-wave sleep enhancers, intravenous γ-globulin, tramadol and corticosteroids.",

The literature supports the etiology as “high loop gain/increased controller gain,” along with central sleep apnea (CSA) associated with common diagnoses (e.g. heart failure). Available data place the adult population prevalence at about 0.05% (men) and 0.003% (women), while up to 11% of patients diagnosed with CSA may be classified as ICSA. Symptoms may include nocturnal choking, witnessed apneas, awakenings with the sensation of shortness of breath, restless sleep, insomnia, non-restorative sleep, daytime sleepiness, fatigue, and variable degrees of snoring. Per the ICSD-3, ICSA may only be diagnosed if “The disorder [CSA] is not better explained by another current sleep disorder, medical or neurologic disorder, medication use, or substance use disorder.” However, a putative diagnosis of ICSA should prompt a comprehensive search for asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction without heart failure, atrial fibrillation, carotid artery disease, ischemic central nervous system pathology, acromegaly, and licit or illicit respiratory depressant drug use, which could be a potential cause of CSA. Systematic studies are needed to determine the cost effectiveness of this approach. However, if present, ICSA is excluded and intervention can be initiated for the underlying diagnosis, which may resolve CSA and, importantly, improve outcomes specific to the causative disease. Treatment options for ICSA include devices such as adaptive servo-ventilation or transvenous phrenic nerve stimulation, medications such as acetazolamide, and sleep position training.",

Le concept de remission fonctionnelle a pris de l'importance dans notre societe ces dernieres annees. L'aptitude a la reprise de travail en fait partie. De nombreux facteurs peuvent influencer la remission fonctionnelle d'un episode depressif majeur en remission clinique partielle comme les symptomes cliniques residuels de la depression (symptomatologie anxieuse, troubles du sommeil...), les comorbidites (psychiatriques / somatiques eventuelles), la prise d'un traitement antidepresseur, les evenements professionnels, les troubles cognitifs residuels de la depression (deficit des fonctions executives, deficits attentionnels, ralentissement psychomoteur).

      "abstract": "Fibromyalgia is a syndrome characterized by chronic widespread musculoskeletal pain, tenderness, fatigue and associated symptoms which include cognitive difficulties, abdominal symptoms etc. A leading paradigm regarding the pathogenesis of fibromyalgia (and similar functional disorders) focuses on the concept of central sensitization. This concept describes a situation in which there is an increased sensitivity of the central nervous system to the processing and transmission of pain, leading to the development of clinical phenomena such as allodynia and hyperalgesia. Various lines of evidence have contributed to the development of the central sensitization paradigm. A decrease in the capacity of the nervous system to perform descending pain inhibition is one aspect of this paradigm. Increased windup and long term potentiation are additional phenomena. An increase in the CSF-level of pain-facilitating neurotransmitters, coupled with a decrease in pain inhibitory transmitters, has also been described. Novel mechanisms such as microglia cell activation are under investigation. Certain clinical characteristics may alert the clinician to the possibility that a patient is suffering from centralized pain (i.e. fibromyalgia or related syndromes). Multiple sites of pain are typical, as well as a long history of pain- related complaints in the same patients. Disturbed sleep, fatigue and dyscognition are typical. Various triggers such as physical trauma, infection and stress are often reported and tenderness is demonstrable on physical examination. Functional imaging of the central nervous system, including techniques such as fMRI, proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy and resting connectivity analysis, are improving our understanding regarding the neural mechanism underlying central sensitization.",

Pequenos agravos à homeostase ensejam a reaparição dos sintomas aprendidos e gravados. Não se trata de reflexos condicionados, pois que, nestes, o estímulo condicionador é específico, ao passo que nos casos aqui comentados (síndrome de esforço, rinite alérgica, hiperfagia, falso hipertireoidismo, colon irritável, úlcera péptica, enxaqueca) os agravos à homeostase eram inespecíficos, sempre diversos entre si, ora psíquicos ora somáticos. O desencadeamento psicógeno evidente tem ocasionado equívocos e permitido pensar em etiologia psicógena, quando há apenas fatores desencadeadores não só psicógenos, mas também somatógenos. Destacamos fatôres inespecíficos das crises e não causas psicógenas específicas da doença. Estuda-se a presença do sentido dos sintomas, hoje tão buscada pelos psicoterapeutas. O sentido finalista dos sintomas pode ser adicional secundário e não torna ilegítima a avaliação médico-legal do sintoma. A ocorrência cada vez mais fácil dêsses sintomas acaba por ser uma contingência singular a que chamamos \"reação predileta pessoal\" porque toda alteração da homeostase, desencadeia, invariàvelmente, os mesmos sintomas. É então fácil a sua \"psiquização\", isto é, os sintomas somáticos contraem relações profundas com o equilíbrio psíquico, de modo que, a tôda alteração dêste equilíbrio, irrompem os sintomas preferenciais. Apesar dêsses vínculos evidentes entre sintomas e equilíbrio emocional, êles são cegos de sentido, pelo menos no início, antes da \"psiquização\". A gravação de ciclos funcionais preferenciais é um conhecimento registrado em Neurofisiologia, aqui aplicado à clínica e que vai enriquecer o capítulo da \"escolha do sintoma\". Velhos problemas que sempre intrigaram os estudiosos da psicossomática - porque, por exemplo, em vez de causas específicas para enxaqueca, úlcera péptica, colopatias, etc, só se encontram fatôres inespecíficos - são abordados e respondidos: a gravação de ciclos funcionais preferenciais é ativada por qualquer desequilíbrio da homeostase e o organismo tem uma \"resposta predileta pessoal\", sempre a mesma. Estudou-se, enfim, a autenticidade, ou não, de sintomas nas \"neuroses de renda\".",

Este ensayo reflexivo, se ha propuesto analizar el fenómeno y abordarlo desde diversas perspectivas psicológicas que nos brinden una posible explicación lógica y coherente del suceso con el fin de esclarecerlo frente a las supersticiones de la cultura a través del método hermenéutico. Los signos de los posesos pueden deberse a otros factores, tanto neurobiológicos como psicológicos, como, por ejemplo, la aversión a los objetos religiosos y el surgimiento de una segunda personalidad, puede deberse a un cuadro de trastorno conversivo (neurosis) o presentarse en la esquizofrenia (psicosis), y la amnesia después del episodio puede deberse a la sobrecarga funcional del cerebro. Existen otros signos más complejos de explicar, como lo son el hablar en lenguas diferentes o la levitación; el primero lo trataremos descriptivamente desde el síndrome del idioma extranjero, que puede presentarse producto de factores neurológicos o en la misma psicosis, y la levitación podemos verla desde la física, con la llamada levitación magnética, a través de una hipótesis en la cual esta condición podría cumplirse en los seres humanos debido a la sobreexcitación cerebral que generaría cierto campo magnético. Finalmente, dentro de los aportes del psicoanálisis encontramos la neurosis como forma en que se manifiesta este fenómeno y damos por concluido que la posesión demoníaca se debe a dos sucesos: neurosis o psicosis, recalcando la importancia del análisis del contexto para realizar criterios diferenciadores en nuestro diagnóstico psicológico.",

      "title": "Sonographic Changes in Hypoxic-Ischaemic Encephalopathy",
      "abstract": "Hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE) in a full-term infant is a clinically defined syndrome of the disturbed neurologic function in the earliest days after birth in infancy, manifested by difficulty with initiating and maintaining respiration, the depression of the muscle tone and reflexes, the subnormal level of consciousness and often seizures (Nelson & Leviton, 1991). HIE is the term used to describe the resultant condition due to a deficit in the oxygen supply to the brain. The neonatal brain can have a lack of oxygen through two major pathogenetic mechanisms, hypoxemia, which is a diminished amount of oxygen in the blood supply, and ischemia, which is a diminished amount of blood perfusing the brain. During the perinatal period hypoxemia or ischemia or both occur as a result of asphyxia, an impairement in the exchange of respiratory gases, oxygen and carbon dioxide. The duration and severity of HIE depend of the severity of asphyxia. Neonatal asphyxial encephalopathy occurs in 1–2 per 1000 births in the high income countries (Marlow & Budge, 2005; Pierrat et al., 2005; Barkovich, 2005), in low-income countries, the incidence is much higher (Ellis et al., 2000; Black et al., 2010).",

Children with neurodevelopmental disorders can experience difficulties with language and speech, motor skills, behavior, memory, learning, or other neurological functions. While the symptoms and behaviors of neurodevelopmental disabilities often change or evolve as a child grows older, some disabilities are permanent.

Based on the National Center for Sleep Disorders Research Classification,5 insomnia symptoms can be defined as subjective complaints of difficulty falling asleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, early awakening and non refreshing sleep despite an adequate opportunity to sleep. An important consideration is whether the presence of one or more of these symptoms causes significant impairment to the patient’s social, occupational or other important areas of functioning. Insomnia can be due to primary or secondary causes. Primary insomnia refers to insomnia that appears to be unrelated to any identifiable underlying medical or psychiatric disorder.6,7 Secondary causes of insomnia include conditions where another disorder contributing to or aggravating the insomnia can be diagnosed (Table1). The diagnosis of sleep disorders is often based on obtaining a detailed sleep history, a neuropsychiatric evaluation, a physical examination looking for medical and other disorders, mental status examination and relevant investigations. A sleep diary that the patient maintains in which sleep-relevant behaviours such as bedtime and waking times, awakenings, total sleep time, napping, medications, alcohol and mood on waking often provides valuable information for the patient and physician.

Acute DID (ADID) occurs soon after starting to take a drug or raising its dose, and switching from one antipsychotic medication to another, especially to its injectable dosage form. Tardive DID (TDID) develops a few months or years after starting drug intake or 3 months after stopping therapy. The diagnosis of TDID is based on the persistence of dystonic hyperkinesis for more than 1 month, the use of a dopamine receptor blocking agent, and the absence of other causes of its development. The risk factors for DID are male sex; young age (less than 30 years of age); a history of dystonic reactions; hypocalcemia, alcohol use while taking the drug. DID is most commonly related to therapy with antipsychotics, metoclopramide, antidepressants, and antiepileptic drugs. The short-term use of anticholinergic drugs (benzotropin, diphenhydramine) is effective in treating ADID. Anticholinergic drugs and atypical antipsychotics (clozapine, quetiapine), benzodiazepines, muscle relaxants (baclofen), and dopamine reuptake inhibitors (tetrabenazine) are used to treat TDID. To prevent DID, it is very important that a physician should be aware of that this unwanted adverse reaction may occur and that a drug with the lowest risk for DID should be chosen.",

      "abstract": "SYNOPSIS Migraine has been hypothesized to be the clinical expression of a deficiency in pain modulating mechanisms. Abnormalities in opiate receptor responsiveness may be an aspect of this dysfunction. In migraine patients, i.v. administration of pentazocine (15 mg), a kappa and sigma opiate receptor agonist, provoked: (1) disturbances in visual and/or body image perception in 9 of the 24 treated patients, different from controls where these phenomena were never observed; (2) other symptoms which were also reported by controls; (3) miosis, without differences from controls. No differences between common and classical migraine sufferers were found. In patients complaining of perceptive disorders from pentazocine the other symptoms were longer lasting and miosis less intense than in the remaining patients, who responded to the drug as controls did. Two subgroups of patients could be defined, with and without pentazocine‐induced perceptive disturbances, the former abnormally, the latter normally reacting to the drug. Pretreatment with naloxone (0.4 mg): (a) prevented pentazocine‐induced perceptive disturbances, (b) shortened duration of the other symptoms in both patients and controls, (c) antagonized pentazocine‐induced miosis in controls but not in patients. It was discussed whether reduced miosis in patients with pentazocine‐induced perceptive disorders depends on a hyporesponsiveness of kappa receptors, or may be attributed to the sigma opiate receptor hyperreactivity upon which the perceptive disturbances seem to depend.",

Some of these events can be violent and result in injuries to self or others, and some may even result in disability or death. There are no predictors to determine if a parasomnia will result in violence; hence, it is importance to learn to identify parasomnias in general and intervene when necessary. A detailed patient history is required to identify parasomnias. Video polysomnography is the recommended test to use, and additional electromyogram leads can be added to identify movement and correlate events with sleep or wakefulness. The polysomnogram is also helpful to determine presence of obstructive sleep apnea, which is a known precipitating factor for parasomnias. Other precipitating and predisposing factors are fragmented sleep, deprivation of sleep, alcohol, medications, disorders of sleep (eg, sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, insomnia, narcolepsy), and environmental triggers such as sudden noise, flickering light, or bed partner's snoring. Violent parasomnias that result in harm can be adjudicated to criminal courts, where investigation attempts to determine the presence of consciousness in the patient during the episode, indicating intent.

Dysthymia is a common kind of mood disorder. Often the symptoms are heterogeneous. In about one-third of the cases there are superimposed episodes of major depression, called double depression. As a result of the chronic course of dysthymia, dependence on alcohol or other substances is common. Double depression is relatively well suited to antidepressive treatment, whereas “pure” dysthymias, the mildest case in particular, show little response to antidepressant drugs. The concept of reactive depression is discussed. In DSM-III-R this is at present not included under mood disorders (but is found under adjustment disorders).

      "abstract": "Pediatric bipolar disorder is a severe, chronic, and disabling illness that adversely impacts the child's psychosocial development including family, social, and academic functioning. Prevalence of bipolar disorder is about 1% in adolescents. Diagnosis of bipolar disorder in children and younger adolescents is a challenge, as symptoms may differ from those typically observed in late adolescence and adulthood. One main area of debate centers around the core mood symptom of pediatric mania. The presence of classic cardinal symptoms of euphoria and/or grandiosity characterized by distinctive developmental expressions is emphasized by one view, while another view stresses the distinctly assaultive and persistent irritability of pediatric mania. The non-episodic, continuous, rapid cycling pattern and the high rate of mixed mania pose additional diagnostic challenge, as clinicians may not be able to rely on the typical presence of mood swings to make the diagnosis. Frequent occurrence of comorbid disorders exhibiting symptom overlap with pediatric mania, such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may further complicate the diagnosis. Appreciation of current evidence combined with exercise of good clinical judgment may help clinicians optimally diagnose a substantial number of psychiatrically referred youths who present with a complex and severe symptomatology suggestive of bipolar disorder.",

      "abstract": "Abuse of alcohol (ethanol) and abuse of an increasing number of drugs (e.g. analgesics and sedatives) are among the outstanding social and medical problems of many industrialized countries including Switzerland. Since alcohol consumption has profound effects on both the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic actions of a variety of drugs, the rational use of drugs in alcoholics is an increasingly difficult task and requires a thorough understanding of the physiologic, biochemical, pharmacologic and toxic actions of alcohol. Clinically the most important targets of alcohol action are the liver and the central nervous system (CNS), both of which are frequently involved in the mediation of potentially fatal interactions between drugs and alcohol. In practice the most important of these interactions include (a) inhibition of hepatic (cytochrome P450 dependent) drug oxidation by acute alcohol ingestion resulting in increased bioavailability of drugs that are predominantly excreted by hepatic metabolism, (b) inhibition of acetaldehydedehydrogenase by some drugs with production of an acute flushing reaction to alcohol, (c) increased sensitivity of the CNS to a variety of sedative drugs following acute alcohol ingestion leading to enhanced CNS toxicity of most psychoactive drugs, (d) stimulation of hepatic drug oxidation and decreased CNS sensitivity to sedatives after chronic alcohol abuse, thus explaining the \"metabolic\" and pharmacodynamic tolerance of these patients towards psychoactive agents, and (e) depressed drug metabolism and increased CNS sensitivity to sedative and hypnotic drugs in patients with cirrhosis of the liver. The mechanisms and practical consequences of the clinically most important influences of acute and chronic alcohol ingestion on the pharmacokinetics and the pharmacodynamic actions of drugs are outlined.",

Some groups are subdivided according to the circumstances surrounding the spells, for example, seated eating, nocturnal, associated with bowel movement, response to anticonvulsant therapy, etc. The following conclusions seem warranted: 1) The evidence favors the existence of a type of akinetic seizure resembling cardiac syncope; 2) loss of consciousness while seated eating (prandial syncope) may comprise a syndrome; 3) syncope related to bowel movement or abdominal pain is a striking association; 4)sporadic nocturnal syncope due to temporary hyp or e activity ofbaroreceptors is not sufficiently recognized; 5) alcohol ingestion may precipitate orthostatic hy-poreactivity of baroreceptors is not sufficiently recognized; 5) alcohol ingestion may precipitate orthostatic hypotension. Familial syncope, syncope proneness and cold drink syncope are illustrated.",

The clinical features of delirium predominantly involve subacute changes in cognition, awareness, and activity levels, behavioral disturbance, clouding consciousness, and sleep-wake cycle changes. In contrast, epilepsy involves the acute interruption of brain function, often with convulsive activity, falls, and injury. States that may share the clinical features of both, such as nonconvulsive epileptic states, are also important: the cause of brain derangement is one of excessive and abnormal electrical brain activity. In such conditions, the clinical manifestations may resemble states of delirium and confusion, and the absence of convulsive clinical activity is significant. Electroencephalography remains the diagnostic test of choice: it is essential for differentiating these two conditions, enabling the distinctly different treatments and epilepsy. Ongoing research and investigation are essential to better understand the abnormal brat mechanisms underlying delirium, and to develop better tools for objective diagnosis.",

      "abstract": "Depression is defined in diagnostic literature as a mood disorder characterized by depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure in activities, significant changes in weight, insomnia or hypersomnia, psychomotor agitation or retardation, fatigue or loss of energy, feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt, difficulty concentrating, and suicidal ideation and/or attempts. Research suggests a link between depressed mood and monoamine depletion, elevated cortisol, and inflammation, but existing laboratory evidence is inconclusive. Current treatments for depression include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), and lifestyle changes; however, more severe forms of the disorder can require other medication, sometimes in combination with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Disagreement persists over how to define and classify depression, in part due to its ambivalent relationship to melancholia, which has existed as a medical concept in different forms since antiquity. Melancholia was reconfigured in 19th-century medicine from traditional melancholy madness into a modern mood disorder. In the early 20th century, melancholia gradually fell out of use as a diagnostic term with the introduction of manic-depressive insanity and unipolar depression. Following the publication of <italic>DSM-III</italic> in 1980 and the introduction of SSRIs a few years later, major depressive disorder became ubiquitous. Consumption of antidepressants have continued to rise year after year, and the World Health Organization notes depression as the leading cause of disability worldwide. At present, internationally recognized systems of classification favor a single category for depressive illness (alongside a circular mood disorder, bipolar I and II), but this view is challenged by clinicians and researchers who argue for the reinstatement of melancholia as a separate and distinct mood disorder with marked somatic and psychotic features.",

      "abstract": "Besides sleep apnea, the main disorders of excessive daytime sleepiness include narcolepsy and hypersomnia. Narcolepsy is characterized by periods of irresistible sleepiness and sleep attacks of brief duration and, most often, by one or more of the auxiliary symptoms: cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and hypnogogic hallucinations. Generally, sleepiness and sleep attacks in hypersomnia are of longer duration and are more resistible than in narcolepsy; also, the auxiliary symptoms are absent. There are three types of hypersomnia: idiopathic, secondary, and periodic. Nocturnal sleep is typically disrupted in narcolepsy, whereas in idiopathic hypersomnia it is prolonged and in secondary hypersomnia it is variable. The exact causes of narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia are unknown; however, there is evidence for genetic predisposition for either disorder. In secondary hypersomnia causative factors include: neurologic, such as head injuries, cerebrovascular insufficiency, and brain tumors; general medical, such as metabolic disorders, various intoxications, and conditions leading to brain hypoxia; and psychiatric, most notably depression. Although the cause of periodic hypersomnia is unclear, most research supports the notion of underlying organic disease. Often, the evaluation of patients with excessive daytime sleepiness can be completed in the office setting, based on the sleep history and a thorough neurologic, general medical, and psychiatric assessment. Whenever indicated, ancillary laboratory studies, such as computed tomography and magnetic resonance scans, should be performed. Sleep laboratory recordings generally are not necessary unless there is suspicion of sleep apnea or narcolepsy in the absence of auxiliary symptoms.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

      "title": "Fatigue in anaesthesiology",
      "abstract": "Fatigue affects everyone. We all remember feeling as though we are jetlagged in the middle of a busy night, desperately trying to stay awake at 4 a.m. If an emergency happens adrenaline kicks in and we wake up; it's the more routine work in which we know sleep deprivation takes its toll. The nature of our work as anaesthesiologists and intensivists can make fatigue particularly problematic. Our patients are often unconscious, so conversation with them does not help keep us alert. We use potentially lethal cocktails of drugs, which we often draw up and administer ourselves, and sometimes machines or monitors malfunction. A few moments' lack of vigilance or misinterpretation of physiological parameters can very quickly have disastrous results. These problems are compounded by the increasing challenge of interpreting and responding to a changing situation when we are tired. For example, the failure to recognise a patient's allergies or the miscalculation of a drug dose can lead to adverse events for patients. Moreover, communication becomes poorer as fatigue sets in, so it can be more challenging to use the team's wisdom to resolve a clinical problem.1 Science confirms what our body tells us. After 12 h awake our empathy starts to wane, logical reasoning is harder, vigilance becomes more variable and cognitive and motor skills become worse to a point where, after 16 to 18 h of wakefulness, our performance is as bad as if we were under the influence of alcohol.2 Our mood deteriorates, we find it much more difficult to think flexibly and respond to quickly-changing situations, and are more likely to take risks. After the ninth consecutive hour of work the risk of being involved in an accident increases and after a 12 h shift we are twice as likely to crash driving home than after an 8 h shift.3 Fatigue: an occupational hazard We accept this as an occupational hazard, but other industries have a different approach. Every other safety critical industry, airline, nuclear, electrical, petrochemical, rail and road haulage are required by law to have formal fatigue risk management strategies. This is not because they have a better understanding of sleep physiology, but because they have had to make changes following several high-impact disasters (Chernobyl, Gulf of Mexico oil spill, Challenger accident).1 The European Board of Anaesthesiology (EBA) Workforce, Working conditions, Welfare (WWW) Standing Committee think it is time for European medicine to change its approach. Sleep is safety Potentially, we can capitalise on the general public's interest in our wellbeing, as patient safety is at risk while we are fatigued. It comes as a surprise to an airline pilot that their anaesthesiologist is allowed to administer an anaesthetic after working continuously for 18 h, or to a train driver that a junior doctor is allowed to drive home after a 24 h shift because there are no rest facilities or opportunities to sleep. The cultures are different in these other industries: sleep is safety. We are more likely to earn the respect of the general public, many of whom work in safety critical industries where fatigue risk management systems (FRMSs) are the norm, if we too create a culture where fatigue is seen as a risk to patients and to staff, and systems and resources are put in place to mitigate its effects. Attitudes to work are changing. Many 'generation Y' trainees have a different outlook on work than their 'generation X' and 'baby boomer' consultants. They want a good working atmosphere, a family-friendly approach, and they expect to be well treated, respected and valued as part of the team and get support in their training. They know fatigue impacts on their ability to train and learn. If they are not well managed many generation Y trainees do not stay; they have less loyalty to employers. To them, long hours and working through tiredness are not rites of passage, a sign of being an unbreakable hero or heroine. Generation Z, who will be entering training soon, will interpret such long hours as a sign that the management is out of touch and has not understood basic sleep physiology, or perhaps that management 'do not value their employees sufficiently to provide the resources needed'.4 This may be partly true, circadian physiology was not part of the curriculum 20 years ago. Our understanding of the vital role sleep has for both our safety and for patient recovery has advanced in recent years. We now know that outcomes are worse for patients operated on in the early hours and sleep deprivation in intensive care negatively impacts on recovery, but this is relatively new information.4 One of the core principles in education is to start where the learners are, so we need to ensure that circadian physiology and good fatigue risk management become a core part of the curriculum and senior anaesthesiologists and intensivists are supported in embedding this learning into their clinical work. However, attitudinal learning is not just about embedding facts in our brains, we have to integrate and demonstrate appropriate values in everything we do. Like any learning, this happens in stages. First, we have to hear what is being said and then understand this – the impacts of fatigue on thinking make more sense to us than details about the functioning of the suprachiasmatic nucleus. But only after we value the learning, do we start to put it into place when we are not being observed. Hence, attitudinal learning about fatigue must involve changes in behaviour and changes in attitudes to napping, driving and working when tired, for it to be sustained. Currently, there seems to be a difference in the way learning about sleep physiology is put into practice compared with, for instance, changes in managing ventilation in ICU. One stays only as academic learning, the other is quickly translated into clinical practice. Why is this? ICU ventilators are expensive, much more expensive than sofa beds for staff naps, so it is probably not financially driven. Someone else has to take responsibility while the doctor has a power nap. This might be problematic as we are all understaffed, but it is rare for us to be frantically busy for the whole night. However, organising someone to take the bleep involves creative thinking, planning and negotiating, skills which are much harder as we get more tired, so this may play a role. The ITU ventilator has a direct impact on patient care. In an understaffed environment where the duty to our patients is paramount, the importance of having a power nap in improving the safety of our own clinical practice may be overlooked. We can learn from other industries here, where such behaviour is expected routine practice as part of the FRMS. A change of culture and regulations Expectations of senior staff and management probably have a major influence. Safety literature describes the difference between 'work as imagined' by seniors and managers who once worked in more junior roles, 'work as done' by current junior staff (who do take naps but don't report these), 'work as prescribed' by seniors telling the juniors what is and is not allowed and 'work as disclosed' by juniors reporting to seniors what happened.5 If 'the boss' expects his or her juniors to soldier on and resist their bodies' urge to sleep, trainees are less likely to nap. Often these expectations stem from the senior's own experience when continuing to work while very fatigued was the norm: 'I managed, why shouldn't you cope?'. Moving from a culture where taking a power nap is seen as weak to one where it is regarded as safe practice, as important as checking the drugs or the machine, would help establish safer working practices. When we take a handover from the night staff, the senior should ask 'Have you had a power nap', and if not, make sure the trainee gets home safely, and review the overnight workload, organisational arrangements and support to see if the situation could be improved.5 Some changes have already happened. Efforts have been made in many countries to introduce the European Working Time Regulations to medicine but tighter regulation of working time and better rostering is difficult to achieve with inadequate workforce numbers. In the UK the British Medical Association produced the Fatigue and Facilities Charter and Good Rostering Guide and senior clinicians were appointed to the post of Guardian of Safe Working Hours in every hospital in England.6,7 This has had some positive effects for trainees, but may impact on their clinical experience and, if there are fewer doctors on call, can lead to them having a higher clinical workload. Additionally it does not address the most hazardous fatigue-related activity for doctors; driving home tired after night work.8 Instead of starting with the regulation of working time arrangements, rota design and more staff, we will be more effective if we measure staff tiredness and manage fatigue-related risk. Frequency, duration and intensity of work, individual clinical experience, level of supervision and support from the wider team all influence fatigue-related risk.8 None of this is affected by regulation, but these strategies are known to be effective in the healthcare environment. Many staff do not get the required 8 h sleep per 24 h and are already sleep deprived when they start work. We need to take this into account, ensure they have rest breaks and encourage napping. But most of all we, anaesthesiologists and intensivists, need to acknowledge that fatigue is a patient and staff safety risk, identify and implement strategies that work in our own teams and hospitals to ensure that staff can 'work safely while fatigued'. Individuals, teams and departments and the wider organisation can all play a part in improving fatigue risk management. A change of mindset and attitude at individual level is very productive. Looking after ourselves by practicing 'good sleep hygiene' (simple measures that assure a restful sleep), 'banking' sleep by spending longer than usual in bed before a more challenging session, limiting napping just before work to 30 min to reduce sleep inertia or drinking coffee about 30 min before a challenging anaesthetic case at night, can all be helpful.9 Organisational support is an important factor. Hospital or department directors should make working arrangements reasonable, give help when difficulties arise, be constantly concerned about their employees' physical and mental health, praise the efforts of the team, organise regular teamwork activities – to cultivate the sense of belonging. A good atmosphere of mutual help among doctors is known to improve morale and wellbeing.10 As a profession, anaesthesiologists and intensivists are compassionate individuals who provide support, healing and encouragement to patients. However, fatigued anaesthesiologists find it difficult to demonstrate our core values – caring for others. Fatigue risk management systems FRMSs consist of sets of procedures for the identification and management of fatigue-related safety risks based on continuous risk assessment. These include tracking sleep and work time and using strategies to mitigate the impacts of fatigue on performance.11 Should we follow the lead of other industries that use such a system and develop formal legally binding fatigue risk management regulations in healthcare? At first sight, this might seem attractive, but as Dawson and Thomas8 point out, solutions developed for other industries (e.g. tighter regulation, more staff, better rotas, enforced breaks during shifts and compulsory rest periods before or after on-call) are sometimes ill-suited to healthcare: we can't simply stop work like a lorry driver when he's done too many hours behind the wheel. Sometimes, as Dawson says 'a tired doctor is better than no doctor'.8 Translating improvements from one setting to another will be relevant only if the work setting, workload, job requirements, cultural and organisational arrangements are properly understood. To implement an intervention successfully, it must be realistic and achievable in the specific organisational context, seen as acceptable, helpful, supported and promoted by senior clinicians and managers. An idea cannot simply be imported from industry: in order to work, careful adaptation and intelligent reinvention are needed.12 Dawson suggests that we need a culture change to one where managers and senior clinicians openly acknowledge that fatigue is a patient and staff safety hazard, and put strategies in place to ensure that staff can 'work safely while fatigued'. We need to build an FRMS using multiple, overlapping layers of defence against fatigue-related incidents, such that an error can only occur when all layers of defence fail.13 This is particularly important now with several safety regulatory procedures being temporarily suspended in worldwide healthcare systems because of the COVID-19 pandemic; for example, work patterns, ICU physician–patient ratios, certification of specialisation, all due to dramatically increased number of ICU patients and shortage of personnel. Some relatively simple actions have been used in other settings for many years and may be useful to us in healthcare. In the 1980s Dinges and Rosefield showed that a 40-min nap during a long-haul night flight reduced the frequency of lapses in concentration from microsleeps in pilots. This went on to be described as a 'power nap'; other suggested terms such as 'prophylactic nap' or 'planned nap' were rejected by the American Federal Aviation Authority as not tough enough for their culture.14 Examples of such a culture also exist in medicine with free text comments from our trainee surveys noting 'lead ICU consultant tried to remove on call room', being told 'it's shift work so you shouldn't need to rest', or 'actively dissuaded trainees from resting, including by threatening disciplinary action'. We could provide quiet dark safe spaces for staff to have a power nap during breaks. Other strategies that could be introduced into the way we manage night shifts include education around driving risk, tools to assess your own fatigue level (e.g. Karolinska Sleepiness Score and Epworth Sleepiness Scale) and fitness to drive home, places to sleep before going home at the end of a shift, and provision of other forms of transport, such as taxis. There should be specific initiatives to protect anaesthesiologists, intensivists and healthcare workers aged more than 55 years involved in overnight work, as the impact of fatigue can worsen with age.15 Could we institute some of these measures and start to build up an FRMS that works in healthcare settings? Measures could be introduced such as making rest facilities and their usage the norm, minimising the chance of healthcare workers becoming impaired at work through thoughtful rota planning, providing enough staffing and providing education for individuals regarding the impact of fatigue on clinical practice, and additional team effort to detect staff who are overly tried and to support them in an appropriate way. Would this start to change our culture, 'the way we do it here'? We do have opportunities. The pandemic has brought into sharp focus the difficulties of excessive workload, understaffing and poor working conditions. Much has been written about impacts on staff wellbeing, there is increased public awareness of the challenges we face and, in many countries, there has been interest in trying to improve matters.13,15 Conclusion Some will embrace the new; innovators and early adopters who welcome improvement. It only takes 20% of people altering behaviour to start and establish new norms. Others will wait until the ideas become mainstream. A few will remain as laggards, for whom the change is too much of a challenge. The EBA WWW Standing Committee initiated the FATIGUE project in 2019, aiming to raise awareness about the consequences of fatigue both on patient safety and on anaesthesiologists' wellbeing and safety. Collaborating closely with the European Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care and other organisations, the EBA WWW working group aims to promote a change of culture and regulations in our specialty by multiple means: evaluation of current European practice (surveys), educational events, publications. The EBA WWW group is working closely with trainees; it won't be many years before there are enough newly appointed consultants to influence safety education about good fatigue management. Of course, we also have a large group of established consultants who also embrace this approach. Hopefully, there will soon be a change of culture and regulations. After all, why should healthcare not have the same requirement for fatigue risk management as every other safety critical industry?",

      "abstract": "Cognitive enhancement is defined as use of drugs and/or other means with the aim to improve the cognitive functions of healthy subjects, in particular memory, attention, creativity and intelligence (intended as problem solving ability) in the absence of any medical indication. Although it can be achieved by non-pharmacological measurements (sleeping, computer training, exercising), people often tend to reach for pharmacological solutions like OTC substances (coffee, energy drinks and Ginkgo biloba extract pills), and most recently, psychostimulant drugs (amphetamines, methylphenidat, modafinil) perscribed by doctors for treatment of ADHD and narcolepsy, which are obtained illegaly from a „black market“. This kind of practice is usually associated with certain social groups like pupils and students with prevalence rates between 1 and 20%, depending on the design of study. Efficiency of pharmacological cognitive enhancement (PCE) also differs among individuals and appears to be the highest in those whose initial neurotransmiter (dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin) concentrations are low. On the other hand, media, as well as public, sees „smart drugs“ as highly efficient and considers PCE to be cheating. Using drugs to inhance cognitive performance is a controversial subject that opens up many scientific and moral questions, which, for now, stay unaswered: should the use of „smart drugs“ be legalized and would legalization lead to social progress, what kind of health consequences (especially on young people) would PCE have, having in mind differences in efficiancy among individuals, how would it be determined in which individuals would the benefit of PCE be bigger than risks, which steps should be taken to educate the public etc. Further research about efficiancy and safety of use of drugs as cognitive enhancers is needed.",

As the terms of reference of this book are psychosomatic disease, it is not proposed to go into detail regarding moderate or major psychiatric illnesses such as severe depression and schizophrenia. The very fact that a patient is in hospital is frequently therapeutic in itself as it means that society, relatives and friends have acknowledged the person's right to receive care and help, and that he is 'worthy' for this to take place. Naturally such a formulation is never spelt out but is implicit in the total situation of hospital admission or even out-patient care. In the majority of conditions where a specific event needs to be altered or cured, for example pneumonia, appendicitis, childbirth, there will be in most cases no need for any further considerations towards the patient's mental state other than perhaps a mild sedative at night. When, however, it has been decided that stress or unresolved anxiety is playing a part in the maintenance of the symptoms, then notwithstanding a specific measure such as gastrectomy or administration of anti-hypertensive drugs, those caring for the patient may wish to use other measures, which can be divided into specific and non-specific.",

This practice does not stem from chronotherapy, which involves scheduling drug administration to enhance its effectiveness, but rather from the way clinical operations are structured. The timing of drug administration can significantly affect a medication's effectiveness and side effects, with the impact varying by up to ten times based on circadian rhythms. Disorders such as major depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia are linked to disruptions in these rhythms. Recent studies have found that circadian dysfunctions, including genetic and neurohumoral changes, underlie many psychiatric conditions. Issues such as an altered glucocorticoid rhythm due to impaired HPA axis function, disturbed melatonin balance, and sleep disturbances have been noted in psychotic disorders. Furthermore, mood disorders have been associated with changes in the expression of circadian rhythm genes such as",

      "title": "Treatment of Mental Health in Patients With Chronic Liver Disease",
      "abstract": "Answer questions and earn CME Content available: Author Interview and Audio Recording The term depression represents a constellation of symptoms that are largely nonspecific in respect to diagnosis. At one extreme is an \"everyday depression,\" a person's experience in the face of a specific challenge, such as paying one's taxes. At the opposite extreme is major depressive disorder (MDD) described by profound subjective hopelessness, helplessness, and worthlessness. Biological symptoms occur, including sleep continuity disorder with early-morning awakening, a diurnal variation of mood, and anhedonia. Because of their nonspecificity, other conditions may easily mimic depression, including symptoms of chronic liver disease (CLD), such as hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and delirium. The key therefore is to apply careful, psychiatric differential diagnoses, especially in CLD. Notably, this article focuses on depression and anxiety, while important coexisting or independent mental health conditions, such as bipolar disorder, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and substance abuse, are not discussed. In any evaluation of a patient with depression and/or anxiety, the aforementioned mental health disorders should be evaluated for and managed appropriately. Patients with CLD can have profoundly altered pharmacokinetics resulting in higher systemic drug levels. Portosystemic shunting in cirrhosis reduces the first-pass metabolism of high-extraction medications.1 The volume of distribution (Vd) is further impacted by decreased transport proteins and ascites and peripheral edema. In addition, drugs eliminated by hepatic metabolism or biliary excretion can have dramatically reduced clearance. The stage of cirrhosis and location of pathology also affect drug metabolism, with glucuronidation often preserved in early cirrhosis compared with cytochrome P450 enzymatic activity, while entities affecting the centrilobular region, such as alcohol-related liver disease, where oxidative functions are focused, impact enzymatic activity to a different degree to a disease affecting the portal region.1 There are additional complexities to consider in CLD, including HE and benzodiazepine sensitivity. In patients with severe MDD (9-item patient health questionnaire [PHQ-9] ≥ 20), the preferred initial treatment is pharmacotherapy plus psychotherapy, which is more efficacious than either treatment modality alone (Fig. 1).2 Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be considered for severe suicidality. For mild-to-moderate MDD (PHQ-9 < 20), initial monotherapy with either second-generation antidepressants (SGAs), such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (Table 1), or psychotherapy is reasonable.3 SGAs and psychotherapy have each shown efficacy as monotherapies and have comparable efficacy and tolerability.3 SGAs are the first-line pharmacological agents due to their efficacy and safety (remission rate of 43% versus 29% in placebo)4 and are comparable across and within respective categories.5 The seminal STAR*D study, which captured a broadly \"real-world\" representative patient sample with both medical and psychiatric comorbidities, reported a 37% remission rate with citalopram as first-line therapy.6 Given the comparable efficacy among SGAs, drug selection is based on symptoms, adverse effects, comorbidities, patient preference, affordability, and prior medication experiences. Importantly, SGAs are low-risk hepatotoxic medications with only rare asymptomatic mild elevation of serum aminotransferases (0.5-1%). A specific concern for SSRIs in CLD is their association with gastrointestinal bleeding partly attributed to serotonin transporter inhibition on platelets affecting platelet aggregation after vascular injury.1 Although the clinical evidence is mixed, caution should still be used with coprescribing of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and antiplatelets.1 Concomitant proton pump inhibitors can be considered to mitigate the risk for bleeding in the more vulnerable patients who have thrombocytopenia or additional risk factors for bleeding. The atypical antidepressant, bupropion, is useful in mitigating sexual dysfunction given the lower rate versus SSRIs/SNRIs (6% versus 16%) or for treating comorbid tobacco dependence, whereas mirtazapine should be avoided in patients with features of metabolic syndrome (~3 kg weight gain after 8 weeks).7 Trazodone is useful for insomnia given its higher rate of somnolence versus SGAs, including mirtazapine (42% versus 25%), and can be considered as first-line therapy if insomnia is a large component of the somatic symptoms, with mirtazapine as an alternative.7 The adverse effects of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors limit their routine use. Antidepressants should be initiated with low doses.1 In CLD, no change is required in the initial dose for SSRIs/SNRIs; however, a target maintenance dose of half of standard dosing is recommended.1 Subsequent titration is based on the balance of response and adverse effects. The dosing principles of SSRIs/SNRIs are the same for TCA use in CLD; however, the risk for HE precipitation needs consideration. It is also recommended to reduce the bupropion and mirtazapine dose by 50%.1 Time to improvement is around 2 weeks; however, most patients do not achieve remission after initial treatment,7 necessitating therapy switch or augmentation with additional interventions. Should patients display minimal improvement after 4 to 6 weeks, the next treatment step is titration to the maximum tolerated dose, an early switch to an alternative SGA,8 or augmentation with psychotherapy.9 The previously referenced STAR*D experience reported 31%, 14%, and 13% remission rates for second, third, and fourth acute pharmacotherapy treatment steps, respectively.6 No one psychotherapy is clearly superior in MDD; however, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or interpersonal psychotherapy are first line because they have been more widely studied.10 CBT involves identifying and changing maladaptive beliefs, improving emotional regulation, and developing personal coping strategies. CBT is effective as monotherapy with higher remission rates achieved versus controls (waiting list or usual care) (41% versus 21%).10 Interpersonal psychotherapy is an attachment-focused psychotherapy that centers on resolving interpersonal problems and symptomatic recovery.10 An important consideration is a patient's willingness to engage fully in psychotherapy, which is crucial in optimizing behavioral intervention efficacy. There are additional behavioral therapies that can be considered, including family therapy, problem-solving therapy, and relaxation techniques. Exercise programs can also be considered depending on tolerability and illness extent.11 Anxiety symptoms are likewise nonspecific and require careful differential diagnosis. Treatment can be deferred with clinical follow-up in mild generalized anxiety disorder (GAD; GAD-7 < 10) if symptoms do not interfere significantly with functioning. For patients who warrant treatment, SSRIs/SNRIs and/or CBT are the established first-line interventions (Fig. 1).12 The benefit of medication and CBT are similar, and the choice of which to use, if not using both, is determined by patient preference, availability, affordability, and adverse effects. There are no differences in the efficacy between SSRIs/SNRIs, and their dosing in CLD is the same as for MDD.12 Patients who have a suboptimal response to a SSRI/SNRI after 4 to 6 weeks should be reassessed for co-occurring untreated conditions or ongoing stressors requiring greater problem-solving focus. If no co-occurring exacerbating factors are elicited, then a different SSRI/SNRI should be initiated. If no response occurs after two SSRI/SNRI trials, then augmentation with either a nonaddictive second-line medication (e.g., buspirone, pregabalin, or hydroxyzine) or CBT should be initiated. Hydroxyzine is useful for short-term control of anxiety symptoms, in lieu of benzodiazepines. If benzodiazepines are being considered in CLD, then short-acting benzodiazepines such as lorazepam (which has no active metabolites) should be prescribed to mitigate the risk for drug accumulation. However, the risk for benzodiazepine dependence, whereby patients develop various behavioral and physical symptoms, including tolerance (loss of efficacy over time) and a withdrawal syndrome with medication cessation, limits their utility. Moreover, patients with CLD treated with at least 3 days of benzodiazepines are at a high risk for developing first-time HE possibly related to increased cerebral benzodiazepine receptor availability in CLD, particularly among patients with alcohol use disorder. Notably, pregabalin (through its agonism of GABA) and hydroxyzine (via its anticholinergic effects) can also increase the risk for HE, and thus patients with CLD who are taking these medications should be monitored carefully. Aerobic exercise, mindfulness-based stress reduction, and yoga may also be worthwhile adjunctive treatments.13 In addition, web-based and telehealth interventions will continue to be incorporated into patient management in the near future.14 If effective, medication for GAD should be continued for at least 12 months given the lower relapse rate versus 6 months of therapy (8.8% versus 53.7%).15 If the patient relapses after cessation of an effective medication, the same medication can be restarted and the treatment course extended.",

Human exposure to aerosols from ichthyotoxic cultures (> or = 2000 cells/ml) has been associated with narcosis, respiratory distress with asthma-like symptoms, severe stomach cramping, nausea, vomiting, and eye irritation with reddening and blurred vision (hours to days); autonomic nervous system dysfunction [localized sweating, erratic heart beat (weeks)]; central nervous system dysfunction [sudden rages and personality change (hours to days), and reversible cognitive impairment and short-term memory loss (weeks)]; and chronic effects including asthma-like symptoms, exercise fatigue, and sensory symptoms (tingling or numbness in lips, hands, and feet; months to years). Elevated hepatic enzyme levels and high phosphorus excretion in one human exposure suggested hepatic and renal dysfunction (weeks); easy infection and low counts of several T-cell types may indicate immune system suppression (months to years). Pfiesteria piscicida is euryhaline and eurythermal, and in bioassays a nontoxic flagellated stage has increased under P enrichment (> or = 100 micrograms SRP/L), suggesting a stimulatory role of nutrients.

Called adjuvant drugs or co-analgesics, these drugs are auxiliary medications, most of which were developed for conditions other than pain, but can play an important role in the relief of pain. Adjuvant simply means “helper”; these drugs may help counteract side effects of the primary pain reliever(s) or help relieve other distressing symptoms, such as nausea, constipation, or breathlessness. Adjuvant analgesics, however, actually relieve pain in their own right in specific circumstances. Unlike the opioids and anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs), which are all-purpose analgesics that relieve any type of pain to some extent, the adjuvants are mechanism-specific, meaning that they may help relieve a particular type of pain but aren’t effective for other types.",

      "abstract": "The human voice undergoes changes over the life span associated with normal development and aging and/or pathological changes in subsystems responsible for voice and speech production (respiration, phonation and articulation). Each change does not immediately indicate presence of the voice disorder. Vocal aging generally begins after the age of approximately 65 years as part of a normal physiological aging. Voice disorders in elderly can be result of the aging process itself or may be caused by some kind of illness or pathological process. Presbyphonia is a term used to describe changes in vocal quality associated with aging process, and presbylarynx is a condition in which age-related changes of the larynx results in presbyphonia. These diagnoses can be made only after careful multidisciplinary examination and exclusion of other pathological changes and possible causes of voice disorder. Some of the symptoms of presbyphonia are changes in vocal pitch, reduced loudness, increased breathiness and hoarsness, weakness of the voice, vocal tremor, inability to sustain phonation and reduced vocal quality. The impact of voice disorders in elderly has been shown to cut across a number of quality-of-life domains such as social interaction, general and emotional health, and psychological well-being. The number of people above the age of 65 is increasing rapidly worldwide and the issue of recognizing and treating voice disorders in this population is becoming increasingly important. Therapy of presbyphonia must be multidisciplinary. Vocal therapy is considered as first method of choice and its efficiency is proven by current researches. Surgical approaches are used if vocal therapy is not showing expected results.\r\nGoal of this review is to present basic information about aging and normal biological changes in the human body caused by the aging process and to show how this changes affect voice quality in the elderly.

      "title": "The Strategy of Clinical Procedure for Determining Brain Death",
      "abstract": "The various aspects of brain death have been subjects of close study by several professional committees, which have for the most part confirmed the 1968 guidelines and clinical protocols for determining that the brain is dead. The central considerations in the diagnosis of brain death are 1) absence of cerebral functions(unreceptivity and unresponsivity); 2) absence of brain stem functions including spontaneous respiration; 3) irreversibility of the state. To these is usually added evidence of catastrophic brain diseases. The absence of cerebral function is judged by the presence of deep coma and total lack of spontaneous movement and motor and vocal response to all visual, auditory, and cutaneous stimulation. The absence of brain stem function is judged by absence of spontaneous eye movements, midposition of the eye, and lack of response to oculocephalic and caloric (oculovestibular) testing; presence of dilated or midposition fixed pupils; paralysis of bulbar musculature(no facial movement or gag, cough, corneal, or sucking reflexes); absence of decerebrate responses to noxious stimuli; and absence of respiratory movements. As a final test of complete apnea, the patient can be disconnected from the respirator for a few minutes, allowing the PC02 to rise to 50 to 60 mmHg, as a stimulus to the medullary respiratory centers. The EEG provides confirmation of cerebral death, and most institutions still demand proof of electrocerebral silence, which be considered to be present if there is no electrical potential of more than 2 V during a 30-min recording. Other variable laboratory tests including cerebral angiography, isotope brain scan, transcranial Doppler, and evoked potential studies are occasionally performed as an ancillatory procedure when the results of the apnea test or the EEG are equivocal. The main difficulties that arise in relation to brain death are not the purely technical issues, but those involving the sensitive management of the family and other medical professionals. It is best not to embark on.",

      "abstract": "Extract Introduction Most movement disorders, with the exception of myoclonus and hemifacial spasm, disappear or greatly attenuate during sleep. However, other abnormal movements can emerge during sleep, either as a primary phenomenon or in association with another underlying movement disorder, such as Parkinson's disease. In addition, some movement disorders are associated with excessive daytime sleepiness or insomnia. A history from the patient's bed-partner is very helpful in the assessment of movement disorders during sleep. The patient themself may not be aware of the problem, and may simply report excessive daytime sleepiness because of poor quality of sleep. Movement disorders during sleep are often a very early symptom of another underlying movement disorder such as Parkinson's disease or multiple system atrophy, but may be overlooked unless specific enquiry is made during history taking. Table 12.1 lists causes of movement disorders which occur during sleep, and movement disorders which may be associated with sleep disturbance.",

      "abstract": "Hunger und andere Formen der Mangelernahrung konnen verschiedene Konsequenzen fur den Organismus nach sich ziehen, wie zum Beispiel eine Herzinsuffizienz, eine Fettleber, Formen der Protein-Energie-Malnutrition wie Kwashiorkor und Marasmus und schlimmstenfalls den Tod. Bisher weniger grundlich untersucht sind die Folgen extremer Unterernahrung fur die Psyche. Menschen, die unter Hunger leiden, wirken antriebs- und kraftlos und lethargisch. Man konnte vermuten, dass sie depressiv sind. Aber erfullen sie wirklich die Diagnosekriterien einer klinischen Depression? Die Beantwortung dieser Frage konnte wichtige Hinweise darauf bergen, welche langfristigen Konsequenzen etwa auf eine Hungersnot oder ein weiteres Ansteigen der Pravalenz der Anorexia Nervosa folgen konnten. Dies konnte sowohl relevant fur die Arbeit von Arzten, Oecotrophologen, Psychologen und anderen therapeutischen Berufsgruppen sein als auch, auf einer globalen Ebene, bedeutsame Informationen fur die okonomischen Folgen beinhalten, die auf eine von Mangelernahrung betroffene Gesellschaft zukommen. So konnte eine durch Hunger induzierte erhohte Depressionspravalenz weitere Kosten fur das wahrscheinlich ohnehin gebeutelte Gesundheitssystem eines betroffenen Staats nach sich ziehen. Zudem ist es fur Menschen, die zusatzlich zu den korperlichen Entbehrungen des Hungers unter Symptomen der Antriebslosigkeit, Hoffnungslosigkeit, Interesse- und Freudlosigkeit leiden, um einiges schwerer, Kraft und Motivation fur den Wiederaufbau eines Landes zu finden. Die vorliegende Arbeit beschaftigt sich daher damit, ob Mangelernahrung zum Entstehen einer Depression fuhrt und welcher Art die gefundenen Symptome sind. Mangelernahrung ist ein weltweit verbreitetes Phanomen, das verschiedene Ursachen haben kann. Wahrend Hunger ein groses Problem in armeren Landern darstellt, entwickeln vor allem in den industrialisierten Landern immer mehr Menschen Essstorungen. Die in dieser Arbeit formulierten Hypothesen wurden anhand einer Zusammenfassung der Literatur und der wichtigsten Studien uberpruft. Es wurde gefunden, dass Mangelernahrung nicht zu einer klinisch diagnostizierbaren Depression, aber dennoch zu ausgepragten depressiven Symptomen fuhrt, die sich nach einer Normalisierung der Nahrungsaufnahme zuruckbilden. Diese Auswirkungen beschranken sich nicht auf einen somatischen Symptombereich, sondern finden sich ebenso in psychischen und kognitiven Gebieten. Weitere insbesondere experimentelle Forschungsarbeiten zur Kontrolle dieser Ergebnisse waren wertvoll fur die Weiterentwicklung des Verstandnisses der Interaktion von Mangelernahrung und Symptomen psychischer Erkrankungen.",

Low dose use in the apathetic medically ill patient has been generally associated with only minimal, short lived side effects, which are detailed herein. Confusion may be worsened in already delirious patients. Anxiety, psychosis, cardiovascular effects, insomnia, and tremor may occur but infrequently require discontinuation. Appetite is normally stimulated in the medically ill. In fact, stimulants are frequently utilized in the medically ill largely because of their minimal toxicity. The history of U.S. stimulant abuse in the twentieth century is briefly discussed. Abuse of prescribed stimulants appears to be infrequent. Over-zealous concern regarding abuse has previously led to unfortunate declines in appropriate utilization of stimulants, e.g., for attention deficit disorder. Guidelines for prescribing stimulants in light of abuse potential are included.",

      "abstract": "Summary Although epilepsy is defined by the occurrence of spontaneous epileptic seizures, a large body of evidence indicates that epilepsy is linked to a spectrum of behavioral, psychiatric, and cognitive disorders as well as to sudden death. Explanations for these associations include the following: (1) The effects of structural lesions that may impair the functions subserved by the regions of the brain involved in the lesion. (2) The effects of seizure activity that may begin well before a clinical seizure occurs and may persist long after it is over, raising questions about what truly constitutes “interictal.” In addition, encephalopathic effects of epilepsy in infancy during critical periods in development may be particularly severe and potentially irreversible. (3) Shared mechanisms underlying seizures as well as these other disorders in the absence of structural lesions or separate diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). Epidemiologic and clinical studies demonstrate the elevated risk of cognitive, psychiatric, and behavioral disorders not just during but also prior to the onset of epilepsy (seizures) itself. These may outlast the active phase of epilepsy as well. The mounting evidence argues strongly for the recognition of epilepsy as part of a spectrum of disorders and against the notion that even uncomplicated epilepsy can a priori be considered benign.",

Clinical experience shows specific situations where it is likely that there is some confusion of terms. We could erroneously understand as palliative sedation the cases of symptomatic treatment of hyperactive delirium in a patient in its last days (a situation that sometimes is presented as the first cause of palliative sedation) or those in which it is carried out a progressive increase in the palliative treatment that often have a sedative effect, parallel to the increased severity of symptoms because of disease progression in severe ill patients. In both scenarios, sedating drugs are used to relieve end-of-life clinical complications and suffering but the circumstances of the patient, the goal of these treatments, and the way they are used do not match the definition of sedation.",

      "title": "Postpartum Delirium: A Psychosis Born in the 18th Century",
      "abstract": "Introduction Pregnancy and childbirth are moments of great vulnerability in a woman’s life, which can predispose her to the development of psychopathology, ranging from transient depressive symptoms (“baby blues”) to psychotic symptoms. Postpartum delirium is the psychiatric syndrome that some authors refer to as puerperal psychosis par excellence. It was first described in the 18th century and were thought to be associated with painful delivery, then became rare after the introduction of effective analgesia. Objectives The objective of this work is to contribute to a better understanding of this condition, through a literature review. Methods Bibliographic research using Pubmed® and the keywords: postpartum delirium. Results Clinical presentation of postpartum delirium includes: constantly varying degrees of consciousness; perplexity; hallucinations or pseudo-hallucinations of one or more organs of sense; delusions or delusive-type thoughts; great motoric unrest and considerable motoric and verbal abandon; and acute aggressive discharges can also occur. It is thought to be due to organic complications, such as infectious disease, abnormal loss of blood, thrombosis, neurological disease, obstetric disease, vitamin deficiencies, hormonal changes. An article from 1975 mentions how difficult was to treat postpartum delirium despite the development of psychopharmaceutical therapy. The patients remained psychotic for long periods and had many relapses. They mention a comparative study that found that the symptomatic treatment of this syndrome with a combination of perfenazine and lithium carbonate produced relatively favorable results. For that reason, at that time, it was the medication of choice. Nowadays the psychopharmacological treatment of puerperal psychosis, in general, still consists of the combination of lithium and an antipsychotic, such as haloperidol, and possibly a benzodiazepine, such as lorazepam. Conclusions Postpartum delirium is rarely mentioned in the literature and just a few cases have been described. It is considered a rare postpartum psychotic condition but would perhaps be less rare if its existence were recognized. On this note, it is important for clinical practice to research on the psychoses of pregnancy and not just the most common. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

Not all patients have all symptoms. When cataplexy is present, the disorder is almost always due to a destruction by the immune system of about 70,000 brain cells that produce a chemical called hypocretin. As this chemical helps in staying awake and regulating sleep and muscle tone, the lack of hypocretin explains all the symptoms of narcolepsy. In these cases of narcolepsy, the disease is life-long and does not resolve. When cataplexy is not present, many causes may be involved and the diagnosis is more difficult. Evolution and response to treatment are also more variable. Narcolepsy is diagnosed using sleep tests, biochemical measures and occasionally by measuring hypocretin in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) after a lumbar puncture.

Thus, the performance of monotonous, routine operations results not only in emotional indifference but also in a reduction in the level of alertness, in drowsiness, apathy, loss of attention, slowed reactions, missing of important signals, and rapidly increasing fatigue. Excessive emotional tension, which can arise in any type of unforeseen, out-of-the-ordinary situation or in performing familiar operations when time is at a premium, is characterized by disorganization of activity, overhasty reactions, an increase in the number of errors (mainly false alarms), and, of course, increasing fatigue because of an excess consumption of energy.",

      "abstract": "\"Altered State of Consciousness\" (ASC) has been defined as a changed overall pattern of conscious experience, or as the subjective feeling and explicit recognition that one's own subjective experience has changed. We argue that these traditional definitions fail to draw a clear line between altered and normal states of consciousness (NSC). We outline a new definition of ASC and argue that the proper way to understand the concept of ASC is to regard it as a representational notion: the alteration that has happened is not an alteration of consciousness (or subjective experience) per se, but an alteration in the informational or representational relationships between consciousness and the world. An altered state of consciousness is defined as a state in which the neurocognitive background mechanisms of consciousness have an increased tendency to produce misrepresentations such as hallucinations, delusions, and memory distortions. Paradigm examples of such generally misrepresentational, temporary, and reversible states are dreaming, psychotic episodes, psychedelic drug experiences, some epileptic seizures, and hypnosis in highly hypnotizable subjects. The representational definition of ASC should be applied in the theoretical and empirical studies of ASCs to unify and clarify the conceptual basis of ASC research.",

      "abstract": "Taking More TimeThe issue of \"adolescence, brain development and mental disorders\" is central to child and adolescent psychiatry, because the early diagnosis of mental disorders (prodromal symptoms) and the differentiation between \"normal\" age-specific behavioral peculiarities in puberty is not always easy and generates risks in two directions: on the one hand, over-interpretation of \"normal\" behavioral peculiarities and their pathologization, which, especially in this stage of life characterized by the need to find one's own identity and a high degree of suggestibility, entails the risk that adolescents may accept a diagnosis as their own identity, resulting in iatrogenic undesirable developments.On the other hand, there is the trivialization of prodromal symptoms , e.g. he or she \"will grow out of it\", which may have unfavorable consequences.Therefore, a careful specialist diagnosis, taking into account all aspects, is required to enable initiation of proper treatment.\"Early interventions\" as well as exceedingly long watchful waiting may be fatal.A psychiatric illness, if not treated, may have serious consequences for further brain development, especially in the sensitive adolescence phase.Incorrect interpretation of symptoms, for example, misdiagnosing age-specific mood swings, or typical adolescent narcissistic or histrionic patterns as psychiatric illnesses, and focusing the adolescent on them (pathologization), may as well have fatal consequences for the further brain development, because, for example, many psychiatric drugs interfere with relevant brain processes and may cause disorders under certain circumstances.In addition, the selfimage of being a mentally ill person may have consequences for the development of one's own personality and subsequently for brain development.My appeal: Take time for thorough diagnostics, including family dynamics/the life circumstances.In case a definite diagnosis can be established, be courageous and initiate consequent treatment.In case of uncertain diagnosis, regular specialist follow-ups/drug withdrawal trials should be undertaken.In addition, a cost-benefit analysis of medication should be performed together with the patient at various times along the treatment course",

The conditions now prevailing in the educational institutions (mass schooling without any individual orientation before the end of college) oblige the teenager to submit to teaching methods and to the school system. School can reveal the subject's personal problems (anxiety, phobia or depression), but may equally create pathology by not recognising the heterogeneity of individual development and differences in cognitive functioning. In adolescence, the ego is particularly vulnerable. Anything that may induce its instability can create behavioural problems (instability, aggressiveness, inhibition) or problems of thought (anxiety links, difficulties in abstraction). In order to cope with such a haemorrhage of the ego, the adolescent may have recourse to certain behaviours (e.g. use of drugs leading to dependence). So it is important the know well the links between school failure and behavioural problems or drug consumption because, in one way or another, by their sanction or by lack of motivation, these situations will lead very quickly to school disengagement, which in turn leads to the breakdown of the ego.",

      "abstract": "Serotonin syndrome is a potentially life-threatening adverse drug reaction that may occur following therapeutic drug use, inadvertent interactions between drugs, overdose of particular drugs, or the recreational use of certain drugs. Serotonin syndrome is not an idiosyncratic drug reaction; it is a predictable consequence of excess serotonergic activity at central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral serotonin receptors [1]. for this reason, some experts strongly prefer the terms serotonin toxicity or serotonin toxidrome because these more accurately reflect the fact that it is a form of poisoning. It may also be called serotonin sickness, serotonin storm, serotonin poisoning, hyperserotonemia, or serotonergic syndrome [2, 3]. The excess serotonin activity produces a spectrum of specific symptoms including cognitive, autonomic, and somatic effects. The symptoms may range from barely perceptible to fatal. [1]Numerous drugs and drug combinations have been reported to produce serotonin syndrome. Diagnosis of serotonin syndrome includes observing the symptoms produced and a thorough investigation of the patient’s history. The syndrome has a characteristic picture but can be mistaken for other illnesses in some patients, particularly those with neuroleptic malignant syndrome. No laboratory tests can currently confirm the diagnosis [3].",

The severity of the phenotype is dependent on the degree of cerebral insult, extent of subsequent injury incurred; with some correlation with outcome [1–4]. Because of the wide variety and often changing signs and symptoms post HI, coupled with the numerous co-morbid metabolic and systemic problems and the frequent occurrence of seizures which can be very difficult to differentiate clinically, this article will concentrate solely on describing the hyperkinetic non-epileptic movement disorder observed following transient HI in the term newborn.",

La diagnosi psichiatrica del paziente formulata il giorno successivo alla messa in atto di un gesto criminale o violento e indispensabile, ma non e sufficiente. Non e necessariamente la stessa diagnosi dell’esame psichiatrico anamnestico prima del fatto e soprattutto non e necessariamente uguale alla diagnosi psichiatrica durante il fatto. Ad esempio, molte donne che hanno ucciso il figlio nel corso di una psicosi post-partum si presentano dopo l’omicidio con una sintomatologia prevalentemente depressiva, mentre al momento del gesto presentavano una sintomatologia piu facilmente riconducibile ad uno stato espansivo o misto, ed ancora prima del gesto presentavano non solo un temperamento irritabile in un contesto d’incapacita genitoriale. Ignorare l’evoluzione della psicopatologia psichiatrica, in generale e soprattutto in relazione alla criminalita, non permette una valutazione e un trattamento adeguati.\r\nE infine utile e necessario ricordare che comportamenti criminali e suicidio sono fenomeni ad eziologia multifattoriale in cui entrano in gioco variabili biologiche, psicologiche, psichiatriche, sociali, ideologiche ecc. In questo senso la diagnosi e la terapia (farmacologica o psicoterapica) sono di stretta competenza psichiatrica ed utili per la comprensione della criminalita ma non sufficienti perche non costituiscono gli unici fattori causali.",

Two cases of Parkinsonian syndrome occurring after starting therapy with calcium inhibitors (verapamil in one case and diltiazem in the other) are reported.

The condition could be due to inhibition of the calcium channels in the central nervous system disturbing neurotransmission.

A clear history is invaluable but should be augmented by physical and mental examinations. Treatment begins with establishment of verbal contact without the use of tranquilizers, if possible. Reassurance and reality defining are often sufficient. With severe ego disruption, medication in combination with verbal interaction may be required.

Numerosas alteraciones metabolicas pueden ser responsables de los trastornos de la conciencia en el postoperatorio, aunque la mayoria no surgen de forma espontanea en el intraoperatorio(2,3). Por ello, una exploracion neurologica superficial es obligada en todo paciente que ingresa y egresa de sala de quirofano, y una determinacion de parametros bioquimicos puede ser necesaria (examenes de laboratorio), asi como la revision detallada de los antecedentes personales y de los acontecimientos intraoperatorios, siempre que no exista un suceso que justifique el problema. La disfuncion cognitiva postoperatoria es un sindrome especifico conocido, con una incidencia que oscila en forma muy variada; segun las diferentes estadisticas, se encuentra entre 0% hasta 79% dependiendo de multiples variables como son el tipo de cirugia, periodo estudiado, poblacion y tipo de test psicologico que se haya implementado. Dado que el deficit cognitivo puede acompanarse de aumento de la morbilidad, sus repercusiones sobre la estadia en el hospital y el costo por paciente pueden ser importantes(4-6). El MMS fue desarrollado por Folstein, et al. (1975) como un metodo practico para facilitar al clinico el graduar el estado cognoscitivo del paciente y poder detectar demencia o delirium. El MMS evalua la orientacion espacial y temporal, el recuerdo inmediato (fijacion), la memoria a medio termino y habilidades de sustraccion serial o el deletreo hacia atras. Tambien mide capacidades constructivas (la habilidad de copiar una figura de Bender), y el uso del lenguaje. La puntuacion total se obtiene sumando los puntos alcanzados en cada tarea y puede ir de 0 a 30(7-9). Una puntuacion entre 27 y 30 puntos se considera normal, de 25 o 26 indica sospecha patologica, de 12 a 24 se considera como deterioro, mientras que una puntuacion de 9 a 12 indica demencia.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Psychedelics are compounds acting by serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) 2A receptor activation and induce several behavioral responses. They are of special interest because of their positive effects on neuropsychiatric disorders (depression and posttraumatic stress disorder). However, several findings revealed that some psychedelic actions are similar to symptoms observed in schizophrenia (psychosis, sensorimotor gating impairments, attention, and working memory deficits) which might limit their clinical applications. Psychedelics activate some neurotransmitters, i.e., serotonergic, and glutamatergic, that are also impaired in schizophrenia. Therefore, the neurobiological background of psychedelics and schizophrenia is partially similar. Another important aspect to discuss is the perspective of using psychedelics in schizophrenia therapy. Postmortem studies showed a loss of synapses in schizophrenia, and the positive effects of psychedelics on neuroplasticity (synaptogenesis, neurogenesis, and neuritogenesis) might be essential in the context of schizophrenia therapy. However, because of psychedelics' psychotic action, the recommended doses of psychedelics in schizophrenia treatment are not established, and subpsychedelic dosing or microdosing are considered. Exploratory studies are needed to determine the tolerability of treatment and appropriate dosing regimen. Another therapeutic option is using non-hallucinogenic psychedelic analogs that also induce neuroplastic outcomes but do not have psychotogenic effects. Further preclinical and clinical studies are needed to recognize the potential effectiveness of 5-HT 2A agonists in schizophrenia therapy.",

      "title": "Antidepressants: misnamed and misrepresented",
      "abstract": "Modern evidence reveals that there is little difference between antidepressants and placebo for the treatment of depression. This is the message of Khan and Brown's review 1 of antidepressant research. In fact, older studies came to the same conclusion. In 1969, the authors of a comprehensive review commissioned by the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health concluded that \"in well-designed studies, the differences between the effectiveness of antidepressant drugs and placebo are not impressive\" 2, p. 19). Problems with the evidence for antidepressants go even deeper than Khan and Brown suggest, however. Not only does this evidence show that these drugs are little different from placebo, but also that there are no grounds to believe they have specific effects that would justify their classification as \"antidepressants\". Like other drugs used for mental health problems, drugs classed as antidepressants are psychoactive substances. Psychoactive substances are drugs that enter the brain and by doing so modify normal thoughts, emotions and behaviours. Recreational drugs have psychoactive properties that some people find pleasant or exciting, but other drugs – including antipsychotics, anticonvulsants and antidepressants – have psychoactive effects that are less appealing. The psychoactive effects of individual antidepressants vary in strength and character, with the effects of some, such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), being weak and subtle, whereas the effects of others are more profound (e.g., the tricyclics). The fact that antidepressants are psychoactive substances has major implications for the interpretation of placebo-controlled trials. Firstly, the use of a psychoactive substance will inevitably impact on the experiences and emotions captured by depression rating scales. The sedative effects of antidepressants, such as the tricyclics and newer drugs like mirtazapine, for example, are likely to reduce the degree of agitation, anxiety and insomnia experienced by people with depression. These symptoms feature strongly in measurement scales. Changes in sleep alone can account for up to 6 points on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, for example, whereas typical antidepressant-placebo differences are around 2 to 3 points 3, 4. Moreover, psychoactive effects may impact in varied ways on thoughts. Secondly, the psychoactive effects of antidepressants, along with the physical modifications they produce (both commonly referred to as \"side effects\", although this is misleading since an independent, therapeutic effect has not been established), will infringe the double blind design. Some of the participants allocated to the active drug will be able to detect that they have received the real drug because of the physical or mental changes the drug produces, especially since they are provided with detailed information on possible side effects. Thus, it has been shown in many placebo-controlled trials of drugs used for mental health problems that participants can guess what they have received better than chance 5. In this situation, people allocated to the active drug are likely to have enhanced expectations of the effectiveness of therapy, and people who suspect they are taking placebo may have unduly negative expectations. Both of these factors may create or exaggerate a difference between antidepressants and placebo. Unless the psychoactive effects of antidepressants are somehow discounted, differences between antidepressants and placebo cannot be interpreted as providing evidence that those drugs have a specific \"antidepressant\" effect. Indeed, it transpires that most drugs with psychoactive effects – including many antipsychotics, benzodiazepines, stimulants, buspirone and opiates 6 – produce the same changes as so-called antidepressants in randomized trials in people diagnosed with depression. Moreover, antidepressants themselves come from a wide array of chemical classes, and produce diverse pharmacological effects. Unsurprisingly, it seems that the experience of taking some sort of mind-altering substance produces a slightly different result from taking an inert placebo, when you attempt to measure people's thoughts and feelings 7, 8. If we accept this model, we need to ask whether the psychoactive effects that antidepressants or other drugs produce might logically be useful in people with depression. There may, for example, be a role for temporary use of drugs with sedative properties to manage insomnia, anxiety and agitation in people who experience these symptoms, balancing proper evidence of benefits against adverse effects, including risks of dependence. There has been some debate as to whether the SSRIs and related antidepressants produce a state of emotional suppression or disengagement. Antipsychotics are well known for dulling emotions, but the effects of SSRIs are likely to be more subtle. Evidence from converging sources now suggests that SSRIs and other newer antidepressants do have this property, and that it is associated with recognized side effects, such as loss of libido and sexual impairment 9-11. Many people dislike this state of emotional numbing but, in theory, some may find it useful to manage an intense emotional crisis. Again, we need evidence to explore whether this particular effect produces any tangible improvement in people suffering from depression, and whether people find it acceptable or not. For decades now people have been told that depression is a chemical imbalance and that antidepressants work by correcting that imbalance. This view is not supported by evidence, and is misleading as to the nature and effects of antidepressant drugs. We need to recognize that antidepressants are psychoactive substances, we need more data on the nature of the varied psychoactive effects they produce, and we need to explore whether giving drugs that produce an artificially altered emotional state is a useful and acceptable intervention for people with depression.",

      "abstract": "Pharmacological neuroenhancement refers to the non-medical use of prescription drugs, alcohol, illegal drugs, or the so-called soft enhancers for the purpose of improving cognition, mood, pro-social behavior, or work and academic performance. This phenomenon is undoubtedly more frequent than previously supposed especially amongst university students. The aim of the present paper was to carefully review and comment on the available literature on neuroenhancement, according to Prisma guidelines. The results showed a great use of all prescribed drugs (benzodiazepines, antidepressants, antipsychotics, nootropic compounds, and especially stimulants) as neuroenhancers amongst healthy subjects, although probably the real prevalence is underestimated. The use of illicit drugs and soft enhancers is similarly quite common. Data on the improvement of cognition by other compounds, such as oxytocin and pheromones, or non-pharmacological techniques, specifically deep brain stimulation and transcranial magnetic stimulation, are still limited. In any case, if it is true that human beings are embedded by the desire to overcome the limits of their intrinsic nature, neuroenhancement practices put into question the concept of authenticity. Therefore, the problem appears quite complex and requires to be deepened and analyzed with no prejudice, although within an ethical conceptual frame.",

      "abstract": "Postoperative delirium (POD) is a disorder of attention and consciousness accompanied by cognitive impairment as a direct consequence of a medical condition, the action (or discontinuation) of a drug, toxin, psychoactive substance or the simultaneous action of several factors. To describe the current state of knowledge on delirium, the Medline PubMed database was searched for full-text articles from the years 2000-2025 using the keywords: \"postoperative delirium,\" \"prediction\" and \"elderly.\" Fifty-six articles were selected for the final analysis. Risk factors for POD are: older age, sensory impairment, alcohol consumption, pre-existing disorders (cognitive, psychomotor activity, sleep-wake rhythm, emotional) and depression. The risk of developing POD can be assessed using questionnaires. Conditions associated with an elevated risk of developing POD include hypertension, history of myocardial infarction and other cardiovascular diseases, anaemia, diabetes, renal failure, urinary incontinence and other micturition disorders. The development of perioperative risk assessment questionnaires (American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classification System, Charlson Comorbidity Score) is based on the presence of comorbidities. In addition to conventional analysis, machine learning and artificial intelligence has emerged as a novel approach to POD risk factors analysis. Markers of delirium are: inflammatory markers (interleukin 6, neutrophil to limphocyte ratio [NLR] ≥3.5, platelet to lymphocyte ratio [PLR] >139, high CRP concentration), markers of brain tissue damage (D-ribose, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, tau protein, S100A12 protein, uric acid), markers of blood-brain barrier damage (urinary albumin, fasting glucose), and many others. The risk of POD can be estimated by ultrasound or computed tomography scan (the cross-sectional diameter of the quadriceps or lumbar muscle) and by electroencephalography. Trigger factors may include major surgery, hypotonia, intraoperative blood transfusion, and the need for intra-aortic counterpulsation. There is no procedure to determine the certain development of delirium. The search for better methods should continue. Recognising the risk of delirium allows earlier preventive measures to be taken and its consequences to be reduced. Med Pr Work Health Saf. 2025;76(3).",

For identification, the term \"Geschwind syndrome\" has been suggested as a name for this group of behavioral phenomena. Support for, and criticism against, the existence of this syndrome as a specific personality disorder has produced more fire than substance, but the presence of an unsettled, ongoing controversy has been acknowledged. At present, the strongest support stems from the many clinicians who have described and attempted to manage seizure patients with these personality features. Carefully directed studies are needed to confirm or deny that the Geschwind syndrome represents a specific epilepsy/psychiatric disorder.",

On the other hand, epilepsy can be the cause of an additional disorder or the consequence of another health problem. Sometimes, epileptic seizures are the first sign of another condition or disease. This chapter will first focus on health problems that can be caused by epilepsy. The second part of the chapter describes other disorders or conditions that can cause epileptic seizures and epilepsy. When a medical disorder causes epileptic seizures, doctors do not always make a diagnosis of epilepsy. If people have seizures that were clearly provoked by another disorder (for instance, a low sodium level caused by diuretic medication—water tablets), treatment should involve the removal of the underlying cause of the seizures and not antiepileptic drugs. However, other medical conditions associated with epilepsy may not always be cured as easily, and people’s quality of life may then be affected by two chronic disorders.",

      "abstract": "Mood disorders are characterized by abnormalities of mood and affect regulation, cognitive changes, motor activity alterations, sleep abnormalities, appetite changes, and other disturbances of homeostatic/drive states (e.g., libido, motivation). Although the etiology of mood disorders in most patients is \"idiopathic,\" neuropsychiatric disorders are commonly associated with disturbances of mood and affect, especially depressive syndromes. A growing literature supports a similar neurobiological basis for mood disorders, regardless of etiology. However, rather than defining a single causative \"lesion\" or neurochemical abnormality, current models propose an integrated set of distinct but interconnected neural systems underlying the phenomenological features of mood disorders. Each of these systems may be more or less disturbed, resulting in variable symptomatic presentation and treatment response. Mood disorders (major depressive disorder, persistent depressive disorder [dysthymia], and bipolar disorder) are a pervasive and costly public health concern. Mood disorders have a 12-month prevalence rate of about 10% and a lifetime prevalence rate of about 20%. Mental and behavioral disorders, especially major depressive disorder, are the leading cause of disability in the United States and present a significant economic burden nationally and globally. Current and developing mood disorder treatments are based on the complex interplay of anatomy, biochemistry, and phenomenology of mood disorders. By analogy, the treatments for many neurological disorders, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), vary depending on the paradigm on which an intervention is based, such as biochemistry (e.g., dopamine agonists, enzyme inhibitors, anticholinergic medication), anatomy, or neurocircuitry (e.g., ablation, deep brain stimulation [DBS]). Similarly, greater acknowledgment of the intricate neurobiology of mood disorders will likely generate many diverse and hopefully effective treatments.",

Herbal medicines are entering into psychiatric practice with the intention of treatment (mostly self-treatment) psychiatric symptoms. Side effects may include changes of mood, thinking processes or behaviour, and interactions with psychiatric medications. Conclusions. With this article we would like to draw attention to common self-treatment or self-medication in persons with psychiatric symptoms, and to the equally common fact that the physicians are – more often than not – unacquainted with this practice. Some of the most frequently used herbal medicines are presented in the article (registered in Slovenia as class C medicinal products). Regardless of their extensive use and implementation of regulatory procedures, in most cases qualitative and quantitative data are insufficient for final conclusions about their efficacy and safety to be reliable. Partial exception to this represents the use of St. John’s worth in the treatment of depression and ginkgo in the treatment of memory impairments in dementia. Self-treatment in general population should not be neglected, however, full professional scepticism should be maintained.",

      "title": "Psychedelics: The New Kid on the Block",
      "abstract": "HISTORY In the early part of twentieth century, these molecules were known as psychotomimetics, meaning that they create a state similar to psychosis. Later on, they were also termed as hallucinogens, but psychedelics usually do not cause hallucinations at a therapeutic dose. The name psychedelics for these substances was first given by Osmond in 1957, meaning that they reveal useful or beneficial properties of the mind.[1] However, the idea that psychedelics can have beneficial effects has had mixed response till recently among the medical fraternity. Psychedelics strictly mean substances that alter perception, mood, and consciousness by acting on brain 5-HT2A receptors mainly as an agonist in the layer 5 of pyramidal cells in the cortex. This definition excludes other agents such as cannabinoids, dissociative agents such as ketamine, and entactogens such as 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, although all of them may cause hallucination, but their mechanism of action is different. The classic serotonin psychedelics such as psilocybin, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), and N, N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) cause brain processes that are significantly different compared with normal consciousness[2] mainly by reducing between-network synchrony and increasing the connectivity between brain networks. These changes in integrative functions of the brain may be demonstrated using investigations such as electroencephalography (EEG)/magnetoencephalography synchrony (decreased) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) connectivity (increased).[2] The effect on brain connectivity is long lasting and may persist for months after single use. Contrary to popular belief, psychedelics do not produce physical dependence or withdrawal on repeated use. PSYCHEDELICS AS TREATMENT Use of plant-based psychedelics like psilocybin or eyote in religious/ritualistic practices has an ancient history particularly in the American continent.[3] Psilocybin mushrooms were used by the Aztec shaman in healing and in a variety of religious rituals. Peyote (Lophophora williamsii) is a small cactus found mainly in the South America and Northern Mexico that has been used since ancient times and is consumed as a sacrament during services of the Native American Church. Psychedelics are an exceptional category of mind-altering substances and has been in use in various cultures as Sacrament.[4,5] In this regard, Jaffe[6] has given a highly revered definition of psychedelics \"…The feature that distinguishes the psychedelic agents from other classes of drug is their capacity reliably to induce states of altered perception, thought, and feeling that are not experienced otherwise except in dreams or at times of religious exaltation.\" Psychedelics played a substantial role in defining the youth culture of the 1960s and 1970s. The powerful psychological effect of LSD was accidently discovered in 1943 by Hofmann,[7] after 10 years of LSD discovery the detection of serotonin in the mammalian brain was done by Twarog and Page in 1953.[8] The discovery of LSD has greatly influenced the research in the field of Serotonin Neuroscience. One of the eminent LSD researchers[8] noted that \"…One basic dimension of behavior… compellingly revealed in LSD states is \"Portentousness\" which is the capacity of the mind to see more than it can tell…. to believe in more than it can rationally justify, to experience boundlessness and \"Boundaryless\" events, from the banal to the profound.\" The word entheogen has been coined as a substitute for psychedelic to reduce the negative overtone. The word entheogen usually means a substance or material that generates God or the divine within someone. However, the effects produced by psychedelics are highly dependent on the set (mental expectation) of the user and the setting (environment).[9] RESEARCH WITH PSYCHEDELICS The initial research into psychedelics was done by the American and European physicians with peyote (Mescaline). Mescaline was identified in 1894 by the German chemist Arthur Heffter, then synthesized in 1919 by the Austrian chemist Ernst Späth. This opened the gate for Medical Research in psychedelics in North America and Europe. As early as in 1934, French psychiatrists Henri Claude suggested the possibility of using mescaline for the treatment of depression.[10] The discovery of the effects of the LSD in 1943 and the rediscovery of Mexican divinatory mushrooms in 1953 led to extensive medical research on psychedelics.[11] However, by 1960s, the research in psychedelics drastically declined due to various factors like anti-war demonstration by so-called hippies who used to abuse LSD, rejection of conventional social norms by adolescents and college students, public hysteria concerning drug-induced insanity, and experiments conducted at a renowned US university without institutional approval.[12] Interestingly, since the late 1980s, there was a gradual increasing interest in psychedelics with numerous publications in the field of neurobiology and neuroscience of psychedelics, which has been termed as \"Psychedelic renaissance.\"[13] Initial clinical trials focused on the benefits of psilocybin to reduce anxiety and improve the mood of patients with cancer.[14] In this randomized, double-blind, cross-over trial, they investigated the effects of a very low dose (1 or 3 mg/70 kg) versus a high dose (22 or 30 mg/70 kg) of psilocybin administered in counterbalanced sequence with 5 weeks between sessions and a 6-month follow-up in 51 cancer patients with symptoms of depression and anxiety. High-dose psilocybin produced large decreases in measures of depressed mood and anxiety, improved quality of life, increased optimism, and decreases in death anxiety. At 6-month follow-up, these changes were maintained, with about 80% of participants continuing to show clinically significant decreases in depressed mood and anxiety.[14] Many researchers have tested psychedelics in conjunction with psychotherapy for the treatment of anxiety and depression. A study compared psilocybin with escitalopram over a 6-week period in patients with moderate-to-severe major depressive disorder in a phase 2, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial. A total of 59 patients were enrolled: 30 were assigned to the psilocybin group and 29 to the escitalopram group. All the subjects received psychotherapy. The primary outcome was the change from baseline in the score on the 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology–Self-Report. At the end of 6 weeks, there was no significant difference in the antidepressant effects between escitalopram and psilocybin.[15] In a recent double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in 29 patients with treatment-resistant depression, a single dose of ayahuasca was compared against placebo.[16] Improvement in depression was assessed with the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale and the Hamilton Depression Rating scale at baseline, at 1, 2, and 7 days after dosing. Significant antidepressant effects of ayahuasca were seen when compared with placebo at all-time points. Ayahuasca is a brew that contains the psychedelic DMT and Harmine (RMAOi). This was a unique study which assessed the efficacy of a single-dose psychedelic in treatment-resistant depressed patients. Researchers have also investigated the effects of psilocybin in addiction disorders. Researchers conducted a proof-of-concept study to assess the effects of psilocybin in alcohol-dependent participants. Ten volunteers received orally administered psilocybin in one or two supervised sessions along with Motivational Enhancement Therapy. Abstinence increased significantly following psilocybin administration (P < 0.05) and was maintained at follow-up to 36 weeks. The magnitude of effects in the first psilocybin session also predicted decreases in craving. There were no significant treatment-related adverse events.[17] Since DMT can induce a rapid (3–5 min) intense altered state of consciousness with a sense of being transported to an alternative world, without any disturbances in wakefulness which subsides within 15–20 min, it is a very useful molecule to study consciousness. In a recent landmark study, they assessed the effects of single bolus dose of 20 mg intravenous DMT on human brain by doing simultaneous fMRI and EEG before (8 min prior), during, and after the DMT dose (20 min) on 20 healthy volunteers in a within group placebo controlled, pseudo-randomized setting. The fMRI results correlated with significant increases in global functional connectivity, network disintegration, and desegregation. DMT was associated with decrease modularity, especially for frontoparietal, salience, and default-mode networks. Analyses of EEG activity revealed widespread decreases in alpha under DMT and increases in both delta and gamma bands. The major finding of the study was dysregulation of activity in the brain's transmodal association cortex pole (TOP), so that TOP becomes less segregated from or more integrated with the rest of the cortex. This implies that brain functions mainly in entropic mode under psychedelics which may be the reason for their distinct phenomenology. This multimodal, multivariate EEG-fMRI study with DMT revealed a robust dysregulating effect on activity in the brain's TOP with increased communication between the TOP of the cortex and the rest of the brain. This may be interpreted as evidence of increased information processing and a hyper-associative style of cognition.[18] Researchers performed a scientometric analysis to assess the research trend on psychedelics over a period of 100 years. A scientometric approach objectively maps the scientific knowledge area and shows how research trends have evolved over time which is superior to bibliometric analysis. Total 31,867 documents cumulating 591,329 references from 2809 different sources in 22 different languages were found, with 95.5% being in English. The analysis revealed reveals two essential time periods. The first time period was from early 1900 to 1990 with maximum 171 articles in 1974. The second time period from 1990 to date presents consistently increasing trend of publications, from 190 publications in 1990 to 1538 in 2021. The topmost cited study was the randomised controlled trial of psilocybin use for life-threatening cancer patients with depression by Solmi et al. with depression was published in 2016. The research network analysis found 16,162 institutions, the top three institutions with highest number of publications were University of California (n = 929), the National Institutes of Health USA (n = 770), and the University of London (n = 740). The important trend saw an evolution from LSD effects to the therapeutic potential psilocybin and DMT.[19] Evidence has been accumulating on the efficacy of psychedelics in depression, several phase 2 trials have shown very promising results; both ayahuasca[20] and psilocybin[21] were superior to placebo, and psilocybin was comparable to escitalopram. Other than depression and anxiety new randomized controlled trials are ongoing to evaluate psychedelics in anorexia nervosa.[22] Interestingly, psychedelics seem to reduce the gap between pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions, using the effects of the pharmacological intervention as a key to enhance psychotherapy.[23] CONCLUSIONS The use of psychedelics in otherwise treatment refractory conditions is perhaps the most promising development in Psychiatry. Multiple phase II and III clinical trials have proven the efficacy of psychedelics particularly Psilocybin in various mental and physical conditions like depression, addictions, anxiety, anorexia nervosa, and pain. Psychedelics are also a good adjunct to psychotherapy. If used responsibly and with proper caution the psychedelics may revolutionize the field of psychopharmacology. With the approval of esketamine in depression, it may not be too far when psilocybin will also be used in patients with various mental health conditions. The ethical and legal ramifications of the same will also have to be looked into and stringent guidelines will have to laid out.",

Dissociative Identity Disorder (DID) is the most popular, widely discussed, and recognized of the DDs. Pathological possession has been included as a symptom of DID in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5). Dissociative amnesia represents the classical functional disorder of episodic memory.

Addiction or dependence are terms used to describe persistent psychoactive drug use, but these terms also can be applied to other forms of repetitive behaviors. Many of these repetitive behaviors are regulated by specific regions of the brain that are influenced by drugs. Consequently, drug addiction may involve effects on systems that are involved in regulating forms of addiction that are necessary for the maintenance of life. Addictions also seem to be regulated by genetic factors. Because drug addiction may influence the activities of systems that evolved to regulate behaviors necessary to survive (ie, eating and drinking) and because individuals may differ in addict-ability for a given drug caused by genetic reasons, addiction should be considered as a disease and therapy should be developed with this concept in mind.",

Not all drugs can be stopped abruptly, since this can result in a rebound-effect or withdrawal symptoms Especially drugs that act on the central nervous system (e.g. psychotropic drugs, dopaminergic drugs, opioids) are known to cause (severe) withdrawal symptoms when stopped abruptly In addition, beta-blockers, corticosteroids and proton-pump inhibitors cause symptoms when stopped without tapering. Gradually tapering off these medicines is needed, sometimes under guidance from a specialist. Moreover, it is important to realize that stopping medication can also introduce interactions.",

      "title": "Ketamine for Depression, 1: Clinical Summary of Issues Related to Efficacy, Adverse Effects, and Mechanism of Action",
      "abstract": "Ketamine is an anesthetic drug that is also used for off-label indications such as the mediation of analgesia and sedation in various settings. It is additionally recognized as an agent with antidepressant potential. For depression, it is most commonly administered as a slow intravenous infusion in subanesthetic doses (usually 0.5 mg/kg). As an antidepressant, is strikingly different from conventional antidepressant drugs in that it brings about rapid and marked attenuation of depressive symptoms even in patients with refractory depression. The benefits are observed within hours of administration, peak after about a day, and are lost 3-12 days later. Patients who do not benefit after the initial dose may benefit with serial dosing or at higher doses. Benefits can be maintained for weeks to months by the continuation of ketamine sessions at 2- to 4-day intervals. Adverse effects include dissociative and psychotomimetic changes that are almost always mild and transient, if present; transient elevation of heart rate and blood pressure often occur. These changes are usually well tolerated and are very seldom responsible for treatment discontinuation. Whereas ketamine is an N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist, and whereas much is known about its different biological effects, its actions that mediate the antidepressant response are presently not known for certain. Although big data on ketamine are presently unavailable, the drug holds promise in the treatment of depression, especially refractory depression.",

However, behavioral and cognitive manifestations can be approached from both the psychological/educational and pharmacological sides. Both approaches are not mutually exclusive but are complementary and synergic. There are currently potent drugs which can improve important symptoms of the FXS, behavioral disorders, hyperactivity, attention deficit, obsessive disorders and anxiety. Pharmacological treatment can be useful: CNS stimulants, clonidine, folic acid, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and atypical antipsychotics. Pharmacological treatment of epilepsy is needed whenever epilepsy occurs. There is no specific antiepileptic for FXS, so action must be taken with the most efficient antiepileptic according to the crisis type, evaluating tolerance and possible effects on behavior. Insomnia is also of interest in children with FXS. In this case the use of melatonin can be of great help.",

Importantly, rates are rising during the pandemic.Suicidal symptoms can develop with depression and, less commonly, with anxiety disorders.In 2019, almost 25% of girls and more than 10% of boys seriously considered suicide.Symptoms are especially common among lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer or questioning (LGBTQ+) youth and Black youth.If you are worried your child is thinking about self-harm, contact a health care professional immediately.Parents, teachers, and pediatric primary care clinicians can monitor for signs of depression and anxiety including school difficulties, changes in sleep or eating, getting along with friends or family, withdrawing from activities, and using screening questionnaires for depression or anxiety in health care visits.Depression and anxiety are treatable with therapy that teaches specific skills, medications, or both.Specific treatment plans de-pend on age, severity of symptoms, ability to access therapy, and family preferences.Families can take care of your own mental health, talk about feelings starting at an early age; teach and model healthy coping strategies; keep your child safe from weapons, abuse, and preventable incidents; and talk to your child's health care professional.Some family and community health strategies to prevent depressionandanxietyincludeparentsaccessingtheirownmentalhealthcare; teaching families skills for effective communication and managing feelings;introducinganti-bullyingandantidiscriminationactivities;supporting families to access basic needs like food and safe housing; and preventing exposure to extreme stresses like abuse and disasters.",

      "abstract": "espanolSe describe la evolucion de las diferentes formas de angustia de una paciente (P) con ataques de panico, durante los siete anos del proceso psicoanalitico. Se considera inicialmente a P como con una organizacion fronteriza de la personalidad. Ella vivia su adolescencia alterada con predominio de la posicion esquizoparanoide; padecia de narcisismo patologico; sufria de agorafobia, ataques de panico y somatizaciones como consecuencia, principalmente, de una insufi ciente separacion-individuacion y de una simbiosis patologica con su madre primitiva. Su angustia de separacion, que inducia a veces ataques de panico y somatizaciones, se re-actualizaba repetitivamente en transferencia y se elaboro durante los primeros anos. Esos y otros sintomas disminuyeron su intensidad paulatinamente, y luego desaparecieron o dejaron de ser una preocupacion. Con el proposito de buscar convergencias, suplementos y divergencias en las teorias, se revisan las conceptualizaciones construidas sobre las diferentes formas de angustias. Las de P corresponden mas a las pre-edipicas que a las de las posiciones posteriores. Varias formas de angustia se relacionan con re-vivencias traumaticas o se producen por anticiparlas y, eventualmente, para evitar estas vivencias desbordantes. Efectivamente, P no ha vivido solamente una separacion traumatica de su madre cuando tenia seis anos, sino que se infi ere haber padecido tambien traumas negativos y acumulativos. Esas vivencias traumaticas no le habian permitido la construccion de un self sufi cientemente cohesivo ni una separacion-individuacion sufi ciente que le permitieran elaborar su adolescencia. Entonces P vivia en angustias permanentes que le precipitaban facilmente en ataques de panico y somatizaciones ante las situaciones de separacion de su madre primitiva-analista. Su angustia de separacion y sus ataques de panico eran tambien los factores de su angustia de muerte y de su insomnio. EnglishThe evolution of the different forms of anxiety of a patient (P) with panic attacks is described during seven years of the psychoanalytic process. The P is considered initially like a borderline organization of the personality. She was living her adolescence altered with predominance of the schizoparanoid position; was suffering of pathological narcissism, agoraphobia, panic attacks and somatisations as consequences, mainly, of an insuffi cient separation-individuation and a pathological symbiosis with her primitive mother. Her anxieties of separation that was inducing, sometimes, panic attacks and somatisations, were reedited repetitively in transference and were elaborated during the fi rst years. Those and other symptoms diminished gradually of intensity, and disappeared or they stopped being a preoccupation. In order to look for convergences, supplementations and divergences in the theories, are reviewed the conceptualisations constructed on the different forms of anxiety. The anxieties of P correspond more to the pre-oedipus anxieties that to those of the later positions. Several forms of anxieties are related to reliving traumatic experiences or they take place to anticipate them and to possibly avoid these overfl owing experiences. Indeed, the P has not only lived one traumatic separation from her mother when she was six years old, but it is inferred that she has also suffered negative and cumulative traumas. Those traumatic experiences had not allowed to the construction of a self suffi ciently cohesive nor a suffi cient separation-individuation that could allow the elaboration of her adolescence. Then the P was living in permanent anxiety that was precipitating easily her panic attacks and somatisations in the presence of the situations of separation of her mother primitive-analyst. Her anxiety of separation and her panic attacks were also the factors of her anxiety of death and insomnia.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Although it is generally believed that a treatment that is more effective than its alternatives will be used, psychological treatments for schizophrenic and other psychotic reactions have been avoided despite the evidence of their effectiveness from the time of “moral treatment” to the present. Less effective (or even destructive) treatments have been seized upon, in part because they do not require understanding patients. Understanding them means facing facts about ourselves, our families, and our society that we do not want to know, or, in the case of repressed feelings and experiences, do not want to know again. This reluctance to understand is particularly tragic in the case of the acutely disturbed college student, whose crisis may lead either to reorganization at a higher level of functioning and growth or to a wasted life. The central role of terror in producing symptoms and the genesis and handling of symptoms, including delusions and hallucinations, are briefly discussed.",

A search was made through different databases for a mnemonic method regarding alarm criteria in emergency headaches, and methods in English and Spanish were found, but there was no mention of one written in Portuguese. Result With that in mind, the method “RISADA PEGA” (“laughter spreads”, in English) was created: Repentina / (Sudden) I - Início depois dos 50 anos / (onset in a patient older than 50) S - Sinais e/ou sintomas de doenças sistêmicas ou neurológicas / (Signs and/or symptoms of systemic or neurologic diseases) A - Anormalidades no exame neurológico/(abnormalities upon neurologic examination) D - Depressão da imunidade(AIDS, Câncer)/Depressed immunity (HIV or cancer) A - Antecedentes: doenças que podem acometer o SNC; número de vindas ao PShistória familiar de cefaleia)/(Prior conditions: diseases affecting the central nervous system; number of visits to the health center, history of headache in the family) P - Padrão alterado (mudança no padrão anterior da cefaleia)/(change in headache pattern) E - Esforço/exertion) G - Gravidez/(pregnancy) A - Autonomia (sinais autonômicos)/(autonomic signs) Conclusion In the emergency department, an acute headache is a symptom presented by 2%-4% of admitted patients. Secondary headaches are associated with high morbidity and mortality. A need exists for the quick identification of the alarm criteria and a correct stratification of the patient's risk, proper diagnosis and treatment. There are also time constraints in the emergency department. This shows the usefulness of a method for quick identification of the alarm criteria. We believe this is a useful tool for medical education and a clinical aid for clinical practitioners, it may also be a way to educate patients regarding the alarm criteria for emergency headaches.",

      "title": "Concussion and mild head injury",
      "abstract": "A concussion is a physical injury to the head resulting in altered mental function, with expectation of recovery within 2–3 weeks. In a significant minority of cases the symptoms persist longer, thereby comprising a symptom complex commonly referred to as the “post concussion syndrome”, that is, one or more somatic (for example, headaches, dizziness), cognitive (for example, poor concentration, memory), or behavioural/affective (for example, irritability, mood swings) symptoms. Unfortunately, the referral of a patient with the possibility of post concussion syndrome to a busy neurology outpatient clinic can precipitate an inward sigh of reluctant resignation in even the most diligent neurologist or neurosurgeon. We know we are in for a potentially lengthy consultation—long on symptoms and short on signs. Moreover, the process can be convoluted and meandering, as unrewarding for the patient as it is unsatisfying for the clinician.\n\nIt is important to acknowledge at the outset that there is a dearth of evidence-based knowledge of the underlying pathogenesis, and even less of the best management of post concussive symptoms. Thus, much of the information and advice in this article is empirical and based on expert and personal experience.\n\nThe terminology surrounding trauma to the head confuses patients, doctors, and lay commentators alike. Terms such as concussion, mild head injury, mild TBI (traumatic brain injury), cerebral concussion, and post concussion syndrome are often used interchangeably to describe the physical injury itself as well as its immediate and later symptomatic consequences. There is in fact no commonly agreed definition of concussion, or whether it even differs from the term mild TBI. Our own working definition is that concussion is an acute trauma-induced change of mental function which generally lasts less than 24 hours (with or without preceding loss of consciousness) and associated with other symptoms (such as headaches and dizziness) which …",

The patient suffered from anxiety and inner restlessness when trying to discontinue the medication, as well as from fatigue and forgetfulness when on medication. The medical history was free of psychiatric disorders and abuse of psychoactive substances.Apart from mild attention and concentration deficits with a mildly depressed mood the psychiatric findings were normal.Consistent with the preliminary diagnosis of a primary non-benzodiazepine dependence (zopiclone), after withdrawal of zopiclone the patient suffered from inner restlessness and psychomotor agitation, vague abdominal pain, and hypertension. The symptoms subsided after administration and subsequent gradual discontinuation of diazepam.Zopiclone dependence has repeatedly been reported in patients with pre-existing substance-related addictions, and in patients with other psychiatric disorders. Primary zopiclone dependence may be regarded as rare. Despite the low dependence potential of non-benzodiazepine hypnotics, the indication of prescription should be thoroughly considered.",

      "abstract": "If in recent years, in other discourses, there has been loss of confidence in the terms and psychosis, their differentiation remains crucial to psychoanalytic practice. 1 term neurosis was dropped from the DSM III in 1980; and in the current DSM IV -TR the term is more apologised for than advocated: The narrowest definition of psychotic is restricted to delusions or prominent hallucinations, with hallucinations occurring in the absence of insight into their pathological nature. 2 There is reference to an alternative definition in terms of a gross impairment in reality testing. This last arguably just makes explicit what the previous one hides behind the words delusion and hallucination.3 By this account",

Unlike other atypical antipsychotics which are known to occasionally cause symptoms of mania or hypomania, clozapine has been shown to be effective at symptom reduction during manic episodes in treatment-resistant bipolar disorder and is generally well tolerated in those severe mood disorders. To our knowledge, there is only one other reported case of potential clozapine-induced mania. In this case report and review, we present a 47-year-old caucasian male with a well-established history of schizophrenia who was voluntarily admitted to an inpatient psychiatric unit for paranoia and auditory hallucinations. The patient had trialed multiple antipsychotics prior to the current hospitalization, with the exception of clozapine. To our knowledge, this is the second case report of manic-like symptoms that may be secondary to clozapine.",

      "abstract": "Epilepsy is a clinical paroxysmal disorder of recurring seizures, excluding alcohol or drug withdrawal seizures or such recurring exogenous events as repeated insulin-induced hypoglycemia. Epilepsy has a profound impact on each individual diagnosed with this disease. Seizures have been and are thought to arise as a result of abnormalities in (a) neural circuits, (b) excitation/inhibition balance, (c) potassium, and (d) genetic abnormalities. Therapy for epilepsy is either medical, entailing the use of a variety of antiepileptic drugs, or surgical. An urgent approach to seizure control is indicated when status epilepticus occurs. When all standard therapy fails, general anesthesia can be used to control status epilepticus. Surgery is an option in the treatment of epilepsy and requires extensive preoperative evaluation. The primary concerns for the neuroanesthesiologist anesthetizing the patient with epilepsy are the capacity of anesthetics to modulate or potentiate seizure activity and the interaction of anesthetic drugs with antiepileptic drugs. Proconvulsant and anticonvulsant properties have been reported for nearly every anesthetic. If seizure spikes are to be evoked during seizure surgery, then light anesthesia with a proconvulsant anesthetic is used. Conscious analgesia can be used for awake seizure surgery. However, if electrocorticography is not planned, then a general anticonvulsant anesthetic maintenance regimen is used. The latter technique also may be useful in patients whose anesthetic management is complicated by an incidental history of epilepsy.",

The specific sounds reported during episodes of exploding head syndrome are quite variable and can include perceptions of fireworks, lightening cracks, or nondescript screaming. Visual experiences (e.g., light flashes) may also be involved. A variety of etiological theories exist for exploding head syndrome, but the most popular of these implicates abnormal surges of neuronal activity within the brainstem during sleep-wake transitions—surges which then are perceived as the loud and startling sounds. Although episodes are more common than initially thought and can have important clinical impacts on sufferers, exploding head syndrome is still a relatively unknown disorder. Further, its characteristic symptoms have also been incorporated into several current conspiracy theories, of which many clinicians may be unaware.",

      "abstract": "IntroductionThe principal routes of cocaine administration are oral, intranasal, intravenous, and inhalation.The slang terms for these routes are, respectively, \"chewing,\" \"snorting,\" \"mainlining,\" \"injecting,\" and \"smoking\" (including freebase and crack cocaine).Cocaine use ranges from occasional use to repeated or compulsive use, with a variety of patterns between these extremes.There is no safe way to use cocaine.Any route of administration can lead to absorption of toxic amounts of cocaine, allowing to acute cardiovascular or cerebrovascular emergencies that could result in sudden death.Repeated cocaine use by any route of administration can produce addiction and other adverse health consequences.Those who snort or sniff cocaine through their noses suffer damage to their nasal and sinus passages.These include nasal crusting, nosebleeds, nasal congestion, irritation, facial pain caused by sinusitis and hoarseness.Cocaine addiction changes the responsiveness of the brain to various neurotransmitters or chemicals.The development of drug addiction involves persistent cellular and molecular changes in the Central Nervious System.The brain dopamine, GABA and glutamate systems play key roles in mediating drug-induced neuroadaptation.We show some physiological changes that can occur in some key pathways in which glutamate, dopamine and GABA receptors are involved.These chemical changes cause different effects in users, including: anxiety, confusion, dizziness, psychosis, headaches and nausea.Cocaine use and addiction affects the sympathetic nervous system (which controls automatic functions such as breathing, heartbeat, etc.).This system secretes adrenaline which raises ones heart rate, narrows blood vessels and significantly increases blood pressure.Chest pain, heart attacks and strokes are common side effects of cocaine use.The most widely studied neurobiological characteristic of cocaine addiction is the role played by dopamine transmission.It is clear that enhanced dopamine transmission in neurons projecting from the ventral mesencephalon to the limbic forebrain, including the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAc), is the pharmacological target for cocaine-induced reinforcement and locomotor stimulation (O'Brien., 2001) However, persistence of the behavioral characteristics of cocaine addiction, such as paranoia (sensitization) and the propensity to relapse years after the acute rewarding effects of the drug have disappeared, indicates that there must also be neuronal substrates undergoing Addictions -From Pathophysiology to Treatment 104 long-term neuroplastic changes.Although studies have endeavored to identify enduring changes in dopamine transmission that might underlie behavioral sensitization and the reinstatement of drug-seeking (relapse), the results have not been entirely consistent with an obligatory role for dopamine.Addiction can be viewed as a form of drug-induced neural plasticity.One of the bestestablished molecular mechanisms of addiction is up-regulation of the cAMP second messenger pathway, which occurs in many neuronal cell types in response to chronic administration of opiates or other drugs of abuse.This up-regulation and the resulting activation of the transcription factor CREB appear to mediate aspects of tolerance and dependence.In contrast, induction of another transcription factor, termed 1FosB, exerts the opposite effect and may contribute to sensitized responses to drug exposure.Knowledge of these mechanisms could lead to more effective treatments for addictive disorders.Cocaine Dopamine Tansporter (DAT) Norepinephrine Transporter (NET) Serotonine Transporter (SERT)",

The most significant clinical change resulted after discontinuing the use of phenytoin, even though the phenytoin blood levels were much below toxic range and the patient had no other signs of phenytoin toxicity. We were not certain as to the cause of this abnormal behavior and psychosis, but the phenytoin clearly had an influence. Since we have reported this isolated occurrence, perhaps other physicians will find patients with a similar response to phenytoin or other anticonvulsants.",

      "abstract": "Key Points 1 Mental status changes are often the earliest indication of an untoward complication after transplantation. These may be obvious, such as hallucinations or paranoid delusions, or they may be subtle, appearing as changes in personality or motivation. 2 The three most common categories of neuropsychiatric posttransplant complications include the following: (1) concurrent pathological processes, such as mass lesion; (2) effects of vasoconstriction secondary to immunosuppressive medications; and (3) central nervous system pharmacodynamic effects of the immunosuppressive medications. 3 This differential diagnosis should guide the history as well as the mental status and neurological examinations. Suspected acute processes deserve computed tomography scanning. Magnetic resonance imaging, more sensitive to subtle structural change, should be generally reserved for cases suggesting such chronic change or those in which treatment appears ineffective. 4 Treatment follows the differential diagnosis. Concurrent diagnoses dictate specific treatment, such as in drainage of a subdural hematoma or administration of antibiotics for cerebral abscess. Symptoms referable to vasoconstriction suggest switching the primary immunosuppressive agent. Symptoms suggesting delirium indicate lowering the dosage of immunosuppressive medication, as in the case of generalized seizure, or use of very low-dose antipsychotic medication, as in cases of confusion, amotivational states, or personality changes.",

Therefore, except for dementia and epilepsy, there are no objective biomarkers for diagnosis. A set of examinations is performed to rule out physical diseases, but there is no diagnostic evaluation tool for depression that corresponds to, for example, blood pressure, blood glucose, x-rays, or echocardiography. The reasons for the poor understanding of the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders include the difficulty in sampling the human brain and CNS, and there are no pure animal models for depression or bipolar disorder because the human and animal brains are very different. Another barrier regarding drug treatment is that high-molecular-weight drugs cannot reach the central nervous system due to the blood-brain barrier.",

      "title": "A practical approach to benzodiazepine discontinuation",
      "abstract": "Non-medical use of benzodiazepines is rare among patients with anxiety disorders. Numerous studies have found that non-medical use, or abuse, of benzodiazepines occurs usually among patients with histories of alcohol and drug abuse--those who use those drugs to get \"high\". This article distinguishes between medical and non-medical use of benzodiazepines in clinical practice, and offers practical approaches to discontinuation of benzodiazepine treatment for both medical and non-medical users of those medicines. The major barrier to clear thinking about the abuse of benzodiazepines is the confusion of \"addiction\" and \"withdrawal\". Addiction means high, unstable dosing outside medical and social boundaries for \"recreational\" purposes, loss of control over use, and continued use despite clear evidence of harm. Alcoholism and heroin addiction are typical examples of addiction (Kalant, 1989). In contrast, withdrawal is a pharmacological consequence of discontinuation of a substance on which a person has become dependent. Many drug-addicted people have only minor withdrawal symptoms when they stop drug use. Many medical patients, with no evidence of addiction, have withdrawal symptoms when they stop treatment, especially when they stop abruptly (e.g. surgical patients using narcotic analgesics and epileptics using benzodiazepines or barbiturates in their treatment). Addiction to benzodiazepines, in the sense of loss of control over use and continued despite harm, is virtually limited to people with pre-existing drug or alcohol abuse, while withdrawal symptoms after prolonged daily use are common among medical users of benzodiazepines. The serious nature of both drug abuse and anxiety disorders is not emphasized sufficiently during medical school or in the professional literature. The distress and disability from which both groups of patients and their families suffer is profound. Fortunately, both drug abuse and anxiety patients receive tremendous benefit from successful treatments, both pharmacological and nonpharmacological (DuPont, 1986a; DuPont, 1984). This article discusses the use of benzodiazepines in two distinct populations--drug abusers and patients with anxiety disorders--and helps clinicians distinguish between the use of benzodiazepines in the two groups. The central distinction made in this article is reflected in the common use of the words \"drugs\" and \"medicines\". The former term often denotes non-medical substance use, while the latter term refers to traditional pharmacotherapy.",

An acute onset of this syndrome, in the absence of other systemic illness or neurological symptoms and signs, indicates autoimmune autonomic ganglionopathy (AAG), in which symptoms are causally related to the presence of antibodies to ganglionic nicotinic acetyl choline receptors. Differential diagnosis consists principally of toxic/metabolic disorders and other autoimmune illnesses, most notably Sjögren’s syndrome. Antibodies to ganglionic nicotinic acetyl choline receptors are present in 50–60% of cases, and, unlike in some other antibody-mediated disorders, symptom severity is related to the antibody level.

      "abstract": "The author recently encountered a patient with hiccups, intermittently accompanied by apparent focal rhythmic diaphragmatic myoclonus after hydrocodone administration. Review of the literature disclosed a paucity of previous reports of hiccup, but many reports of myoclonus after opiate administration. A wide variety of opiates and routes of administration have been implicated, but high doses and the presence of other agents (antipsychotics, antiemetics, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents, antidepressants) may pose special risks. Review of the literature suggests three types of opiate- related myoclonus. Opiate-induced myoclonus (OIM) is often generalized and is either periodic or associated with rigidity. Opiate-induced myoclonus frequently occurs in the context of underlying medical conditions, D2 antagonist coadministration, or other drugs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, antidepressants), and usually responds to either naloxone or benzodiazepines. Intrathecal OIM has not been linked to D2 antagonist coadministration or benzodiazepine responsiveness but may be associated with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents. Opiate withdrawal myoclonus may be stimulus- sensitive, associated with D2 antagonist coadministration, and responsive to benzodiazepines and unresponsive to naloxone. There are several problems in interpreting the literature, and more study is needed. Opiatergic, serotonergic, dopaminergic, and other mechanisms are considered.",

      "title": "A Curious Case of Excessive Winking",
      "abstract": "Spontaneous blinking in humans is mediated by the central dopaminergic activity and can be a useful clinical sign. The blink rate is decreased in diseases of altered dopaminergic activity like Parkinson's disease and increased in Huntington's disease (HD), Tourette's syndrome, and Wilson's disease.1 Blepharoclonus is a rare abnormal movement of the eyelids where repetitive spasms of the lid on gentle eye closure of the eyes are seen.2 We present a case of Juvenile Huntington's Disease (JHD) with a rare combination of excessive eye blinking and blepharoclonus. An 18 year old female presented with complaints of excessive blinking of the eye noticed by her mother since age 15. She had no urge to blink or could suppress her blinking. It was not associated with any other abnormal facial movements. She also had symmetrical onset, distal action tremors of both upper limbs with progressive slowness in her activities, behavioral abnormalities in the form of anger outbursts, interacting less with her family, and refused to attend college since age 16. Her father, two paternal uncles, and grandfather are deceased due to unknown psychiatric disorder and tremors. Neurological examination showed an increased blink rate of 52/min and involuntary fluttering of eyelids on gentle eye closure and on horizontal gaze, upgaze more than downgaze, which is typical of blepharoclonus. Saccadic initiation is delayed with pursuits being slow and broken. The Speech was tremulous and motor impersistence was seen on protruding the tongue. She had cogwheel rigidity in all 4 limbs with bradykinesia and had dystonic posturing of fingers on outstretched hands with distal athetoid movements (Video 1). Laboratory investigations were within normal limits. MRI brain showed an evidence of caudate atrophy (Fig 1A,B). With the suspicion of Huntington's disease, a genetic test is done which revealed 65 CAG repeats in the Huntington gene on chromosome 4. A diagnosis of JHD or West phal variant presenting with blepharoclonus and increased spontaneous blink rate is made. To our knowledge, this is the first case reported in literature with excessive blink rate and blepharoclonus as a presenting symptom in JHD. There was only one case report of excessive blinking as the presenting symptom in HD.3 The normal spontaneous blink rate in humans is 19 ± 14/min and increases in activities like speaking, strong emotions like anger and mental tasks. It decreases in activities like reading.1 The blink rates are low in infancy, increase in childhood years, and stabilize in adulthood.1 The mean blink rate in HD patients is about 36 blinks/min, nearly double the normal rate, and up to 75% of HD patients have subjectively higher blink rates.4 Other disorders with increased blink rate include Tourette's syndrome, Wilson's disease, Schizophrenia, and initially in blepharospasm. Decreased spontaneous blink rate is seen in Parkinson's disease.4 A hyperdopaminergic state usually increases spontaneous blinking and reduces reflexive blinking.4 Blepharoclonus refers to brief, repetitive, clonic, and bilateral contractions of the orbicularis oculi muscles.5 This rare abnormal movement of the eyelids can be elicited by voluntary eye closure and gaze deviation and usually does not coexist with blepharospasm. The reported aetiologies of blepharoclonus are diverse and anatomical localization is ill defined ranging from basal ganglia to brainstem. In 1963, Van Buren et al6 reported rhythmic lid fluttering and rapid bursts of blinking on stimulating the head of the caudate nucleus, probably a blepharoclonus. This might explain the occurrence of this phenomenon in our case of Huntington's disease with predominant caudate involvement. It was also described in conditions of brainstem origin like Arnold-Chiari malformation, aqueductal stenosis and brainstem stroke.5 It has also been associated with a myriad of neurological signs or diseases like multiple sclerosis, migraine, hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with spheroids,7 Parkinson's disease, tremor, cranial synkinesis, myoclonus or as a part of blepharospasm and on recovery from severe head injury.8 Blepharoclonus is found to be a useful clinical diagnostic marker in early PD.9 The other important early eye signs in HD include increased saccade latency, fixation and pursuit abnormalities which are seen in our case. So a simple eye sign like excessive blinking and blepharoclonus can be important clinical clues towards recognizing Juvenile Huntington's disease, more so when they present with features like Parkinsonism. Our case fits into the seminal description of George Huntington's \"The eyelids are kept winking…\".10 (1) Research project: A. Conception, B. Organization, C.

Local anesthetics and epinephrin can cause interactions with other medications. An interaction is considered to be any change in the action of a drug caused by another drug. Interactions are divided into pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic. Knowledge of the interactions of local anesthetics with commonly prescribed drugs is necessary to prevent a possible toxic effect or lack of action of the drug.\r\n Local anesthetics interact with other local anesthetics, benzodiazepines, sulfonamides, and propranolol.

These movement disorders disappeared when the drug was stopped and reappeared when the patient was challenged. Throughout the period of treatment, concentrations of phenytoin in serum were consistently low within the therapeutic range. Interfering symptoms from the cardiovascular system and the absence of some classic symptoms of phenytoin intoxication (nystagmus and dysarthria) contributed to delay the diagnosis. The patient died in hospital and autopsy of the brain showed rather localized encephalomalacies of corpus striatum. The pathogenic action of phenytoin and the role of preexisting brain lesions are discussed. Phenytoin must be suspected as the cause, when patients on this drug present with uncontrollable epilepsy or neurological or mental deterioration.",

The most common substances used for self-inflicted death by poisoning are tricyclic antidepressants, salicylates (particularly children), and street drugs. In the elderly, suicide attempts and unintentional intoxication through misjudgment of dose remain the leading causes. Overdose and acute brain injury may go together. Patients with traumatic brain injury may have been intoxicated or overdosed and some strokes are seen after use of illicit drugs. It is important to assess the severity of the intoxication, but also the management of the patient particularly when there are recurrent seizures or permanent unexplained unconsciousness.

      "abstract": "Illness anxiety disorder (previously called hypochondriasis, a term which has been revised in the DSM-5 due to its disparaging connotation) is a psychiatric disorder defined by excessive worry about having or developing a serious undiagnosed medical condition. People with an illness anxiety disorder (IAD) experience persistent anxiety or fear of developing or having a serious medical illness that adversely affects their daily life. This fear persists despite normal physical examination and laboratory testing results. People suffering from IAD pay excessive attention to normal bodily sensations (such as functions of digestion or sweating) and misinterpret these sensations as indicators of severe disease. IAD is typically a chronic condition.",

      "title": "Fashions in Neurosis",
      "abstract": "The textbooks of a hundred years ago considered the conditions we would call psychotic to be largely psychogenic, the conditions we would call neurotic to be associated with organic diseases, and those we would call hysterical to be due to a special sensitivity of the nervous system or to gynaecological disorders. The conditions corresponding to the neuroses as we know them today, apart from “hysterical insanity” do not seem to have been part of the province of the alienist but of the general physician and later the neurologist. Towards the end of the last century, it was suggested that the term neurosis should apply to a disordered physiological state and the term psychosis to a disordered mind. Psychiatric textbooks of a century ago did not concern themselves with neuroses. The medical textbooks described hysteria in great detail, usually manifestations of a gross kind. The idea of hysteria having something to do with the uterus persisted, Cullen ascribing it to amenorrhoea or too great a salacity. Later, when theories of exhaustion of the nervous system in neurasthenia became popular, the exhaustion was held by some to be caused by the “irritation” of the nervous system by gynaecological disorders. Neuroses with somatic symptomatology tended to be classified under a somatic label. Anxiety states with somatization were attributed either to the common diseases of the day, such as gout or dyspepsia, or to dysfunction of the nervous system. The rest therapy popularized by Weir Mitchell in 1875 got its results through suggestion and the anaclitic meaning it carried. Although popular for “neurasthenia” it was widely used for all mental disorders, and in its day was as revolutionary as shock therapy or the tranquilizers. Focal sepsis and auto-intoxication provided theories which led to the surgical treatment of neuroses. Present day fashions in diagnosis of the neuroses vary with the orientation of the diagnostician: in terms of reaction of a personality, in terms of dynamics, or in terms of symptom groupings.",

Using correlational studies and structural analyses, evidence is provided that unusual sleep experiences, dissociation, and schizotypy belong to a common domain. It is demonstrated that unusual sleep experiences show specificity to dissociation and schizotypy compared to other daytime symptoms (e.g., anxiety, depression, substance use) and other sleep disturbances (e.g., insomnia, lassitude/fatigue). The paper also outlines the methodological limitations of the existing evidence and makes suggestions for future research. Finally, three models for the overlap of daytime and nighttime symptoms are reviewed, including biological abnormalities, trauma, and personality traits. Although further research is needed, it is suggested that daytime and nighttime symptoms result from problems with sleep-wake state boundaries, which may be precipitated by stress or trauma. In addition, association between daytime and nighttime symptoms can be attributed to the higher order personality trait of Oddity.",

Pharmacologic management of acute agitation relies on typical antipsychotics, particularly haloperidol; benzodiazepines; and atypical antipsychotics. The selection of a specific agent (or combination of agents) should be guided by etiologic considerations, efficacy of the drug(s), side effects, potential drug interactions, and drug formulation. Seclusion or restraints are treatments of last resort due to safety issues.Compared with conventional antipsychotics (e.g., haloperidol), preliminary evidence indicates that atypical antipsychotics effectively reduce agitation, are better tolerated, and have fewer side effects. After an acute episode, atypical agents also help ease the transition from intramuscular to oral medication to promote ongoing treatment.",

Various psychosocial stress factors participate in the onset of chronic pain. Psychological symptoms, such as anxiety, anger, depression, hypersensitivity, or irritation, are often related to the onset of chronic pain and change the state of illness. Chronic pain of the musculoskeletal system is often a pathologic reaction against the stress. Because a correlation between physical symptoms and psychological stress factors has been observed, chronic pain can be regarded as a representative form of psychosomatic disease. To improve efficacy in the medical treatment or psychotherapy, it is important to understand the psychosocial condition of chronic pain through sufficient history taking or appropriate psychological tests. For the pharmacological treatment of such chronic pain modified with psychosomatic factors, antianxiety drugs, antidepressants or anticonvulsants may be more effective than general analgesics or physical therapy. Holistic and specialized approaches, such as cognitive therapy or behavioral therapy, may be necessary for the treatment of chronic pain related to improper recognition, obsessive ideas or misunderstanding of the problems.",

Sleep disorders are one of the most common clinical problems encountered in outpatient settings and inpatient settings. Lack of sleep can lead to the inability to concentrate, memory complaints, and deficits in neuropsychological testing. Additionally, sleep disorders can have serious consequences, including fatal accidents related to sleepiness. Disturbed sleep can be a primary diagnosis itself or a component of another medical or psychiatric disorder. Narcolepsy is plausibly caused by an abnormality of REM-inhibiting mechanisms, and recent research involving hypocretin, a neurotransmitter, suggests that hypocretin is significantly reduced in narcolepsy patients. Patients with delayed and advanced sleep phase insomnia can be treated with proper timing of bright light and behavioral changes. Hypersomnia related to a mental disorder is usually found in a variety of conditions such as the early stages of mild depressive disorder, grief, personality disorders, dissociative disorders, and somatoform disorders.",

There is ample epidemiological and experimental evidence that chemical and/or physical factors acting during sensitive time windows of the brain development can cause mental, behavioral, emotional and/or cognitive disorders. Environmental pollutants, addictive substances, drugs, malnutrition, excessive stress and/or hypoxia-ischemia were reported to induce functional maldevelopment of the brain with consequent neurobehavioral disorders.

      "abstract": "The prevalence of depression appears to have increased over the past three decades. While this may be an artefact of diagnostic practices, it is likely that there are factors about modernity that are contributing to this rise. There is now compelling evidence that a range of lifestyle factors are involved in the pathogenesis of depression. Many of these factors can potentially be modified, yet they receive little consideration in the contemporary treatment of depression, where medication and psychological intervention remain the first line treatments. “Lifestyle Medicine” provides a nexus between public health promotion and clinical treatments, involving the application of environmental, behavioural, and psychological principles to enhance physical and mental wellbeing. This may also provide opportunities for general health promotion and potential prevention of depression. In this paper we provide a narrative discussion of the major components of Lifestyle Medicine, consisting of the evidence-based adoption of physical activity or exercise, dietary modification, adequate relaxation/sleep and social interaction, use of mindfulness-based meditation techniques, and the reduction of recreational substances such as nicotine, drugs, and alcohol. We also discuss other potential lifestyle factors that have a more nascent evidence base, such as environmental issues (e.g. urbanisation, and exposure to air, water, noise, and chemical pollution), and the increasing human interface with technology. Clinical considerations are also outlined. While data supports that some of these individual elements are modifiers of overall mental health, and in many cases depression, rigorous research needs to address the long-term application of Lifestyle Medicine for depression prevention and management. Critically, studies exploring lifestyle modification involving multiple lifestyle elements are needed. While the judicious use of medication and psychological techniques are still advocated, due to the complexity of human illness/wellbeing, the emerging evidence encourages a more integrative approach for depression, and an acknowledgment that lifestyle modification should be a routine part of treatment and preventative efforts.",

Abnormalities in patients with conversion disorders are involuntary, whereas patients with the other two conditions are voluntary. Malingering, in particular, might be purposeful for personal benefits such as financial reasons and escape from jail. Common phenotypes of psychogenic neurologic diseases are motor paralysis, sensory loss, constriction of visual field, and seizures (psychogenic non-epileptic seizures, PNES). Clinical features common to all kinds of psychogenic neurologic disorders include incongruity with ordinary neurologic symptoms, inconsistency (variability) of nature, degree and distribution in time, change due to distraction to other stimuli or other matters, and the presence of psychogenic factors in the social or family background.",

      "abstract": "Children who have attention deficit disorder with (or without) hyperactivity are handicapped by their inability to concentrate and control their impulsivity, especially while in school. Specific performance disabilities prevent them from demonstrating, especially through written schoolwork, what they have learned. Parents and teachers are likely to mistake these children's symptoms for willful misbehavior or lack of motivation, which leads to misunderstandings and even mistreatment. The critical issue in the management of a child with hyperactivity is to effectively treat the key problems of inattention and impulsivity rather than the hyperactivity per se. A nonintensive long-term approach combining stimulant therapy and a cooperative liaison among the physician, child, family, and teachers is recommended.",

      "abstract": "Psychosis can present a variety of symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, catatonia, thought and speech disorganization, alogia, avolition and general functional decline. Transient psychotic symptoms are not uncommon during development and are not always indicative of psychopathology. Psychosis can be a manifestation of a schizophrenia spectrum disorder, or occur in the context of a mood disorder, such as major depression or bipolar mania. It can also be due to substance abuse or certain medical conditions, such as the NMDA encephalitis. Most cases of schizophrenia start between 15 and 25 years of age, while an onset under age 13 is rare. Schizophrenia tends to have an insidious onset with many months of subsyndromal and non-specific symptoms prior to the first openly psychotic episode. Repeated use of cannabis in youth increases the risk of psychosis, since the developing brain is especially sensitive to the psychoactive effects of tetrahydrocannabinol. As the duration of untreated psychosis predicts worse functional outcomes over time, a prompt recognition and early treatment of psychotic disorders has high clinical relevance. To this end, a close collaboration between paediatricians and child and adolescent neuropsychiatrists is crucial.",

When administered intravenously in the context of a therapeutic interview, cocaine caused large, rapid increases in pulse and blood pressure concomitant with profound mobilization of affect and tearfulness. Infusions that caused lesser changes in vital signs were associated with milder degrees of affective change and less dysphoria. Thus, while cocaine was capable of eliciting positive affective change (such as calmness and elation) in depressed patients, affective flooding and dysphoric components were often admixed, indicating that cocaine's effect in this context could not be classified simply as antidepressant.",

      "abstract": "Psychiatry is a speciality of medicine concerned with the diagnosis, treatment and study of mental diseases or disorders. Its practitioners are psychiatrists (in the United States, physicians who complete four years of approved training following their 148graduation from medical school). A number of professionals from other disciplines treat patients with psychiatric disorders. The most important of these are clinical psychologists, psychiatric social workers and psychiatric nurses. They commonly refer to those who seek help as 'clients' rather than 'patients'. These professionals may work in various collaborative relationships with psychiatrists or as independent practitioners. They employ the same verbal therapies as psychiatrists. Psychiatry differs from these specialities in being a medical discipline whose practitioners are physicians. As such, psychiatrists are specifically trained to (1) make precise syndromal or aetiological diagnoses, whenever possible, and distinguish one syndrome from another; (2) diagnose (or know when to refer to other physicians) those organic conditions which mimic psychiatric disorders such as brain tumour, cancer of the pancreas, and hyperthyroidism (these conditions can present as anxiety or depressive disorders); (3) treat particular psychiatric disorders with psychotropic medications or other somatic treatments; (4) manage untoward psychological reactions to medical illness; and (5) integrate the biological with the psychological and social dimensions of mental disorders. In addition, the psychiatrist's training in medicine may encourage a research career in the biology of mental disorders. American psychiatrists as a whole have a high level of expertise in psychological treatments, particularly the psychodynamic approach. This is due to the impact of psychoanalytic theory on academic psychiatry especially since 1945, when many distinguished psychoanalysts assumed the chairs of academic departments.",

His symptoms were exacerbated in the wintertime but were not related to meals or sleep. He denied excessive sweating, sensory abnormalities, difficulty with facial or bulbar muscles, and episodes of dark urine. Medical and family history was negative. Cramps and contractures may be identical clinically. The former is more common in neurogenic disease, whereas in myopathies they are more likely to be contractures or myotonia. True cramps occur without provocation. If they are exercise induced (in which the pain has a quasistoichiometric relation to muscle work), they are more suggestive of contractures and suggest abnormal muscle metabolism. Other features of cramps are explosive onset, occurrence in parts of one muscle, occurrence at rest (especially in a muscle in a contracted position) or after triggering movement (either minor or forceful), and relief by passive stretch.",

More than two hundred years have passed since its description, but we still discover its new manifestations. Abnormal behaviors include impulse control disorders, dopamine dysregulation syndrome, psychotic disorders and others. However, two new phenomena have been recently described in patients with PD. It can manifest in the form of doing inappropriate actions which patient doesn't recognize, or pronouncing/writing unsuitable words and phrases. Patients can't remember such episodes, but find «signs» of their unconscious activity or hear about it from attestors. This article represents a review of literature on unrelated communication interlude and automatic behavior in Parkinson's disease and discusses its possible reasons.Болезнь Паркинсона проявляется моторными и разнообразными немоторными симптомами и, хотя прошло уже более 200 лет с момента первого описания, мы все еще открываем новые проявления этого заболевания. Нарушения поведения при болезни Паркинсона могут быть представлены импульсивно-компульсивным расстройством, синдромом дофаминовой дизрегуляции, психотическими нарушениями и др. Недавно были описаны два новых феномена, проявляющиеся в виде совершения неуместных действий, которые частично или полностью не осознаются пациентом, либо произнесением/написанием слов и фраз, случайно вставленных в диалог или текст. Пациенты подобные эпизоды частично или полностью амнезируют, но после произошедшего находят «следы» своей неосознанной деятельности или узнают от удивленного собеседника о странном поведении и ответах невпопад во время разговора.

      "abstract": "Psychedelics are a stigmatized, under-researched class of hallucinogenic drugs with unprecedented boundless potential. Despite a historically widespread cultural use, these drugs were denigrated and prematurely banned before clinical trials could demonstrate their value. It is now known that through full or partial serotonergic receptor agonist activity, psychedelics impart positive effects on a broad spectrum of psychiatric disorders including depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, and obsessive- compulsive behaviors. Furthermore, extremely small, non-intoxifying microdosed psychedelics (1/10th-1/16th typical dose) may potentiate similar effects to full doses without undesirable side effects. These compounds are also unexplored for their potential role in physically active populations. A preponderance of subjective claims and fervent anecdote indicate psychedelics may enhance mental acuity and subsequent exercise performance. Through the same serotonergic-mediated mechanisms that invoke neuroplasticity, psychedelics possibly augment exercise adaptation and offer safer alternatives to current pain management strategies. Despite a wealth of promising clinical data and high drug safety, federal restriction remains a psychological barrier to research and general public acceptance. Therefore, the purpose of this short review is to 1) briefly demonstrate the clinical value of psychedelics, and 2) highlight the potential of microdosing as an effective alternative to full-dose psychedelics whilst emphasizing their latent ergogenic ability.",

      "title": "Generalized Anxiety Disorder",
      "abstract": "Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is a chronic and highly comorbid illness characterized by excessive and uncontrollable worry (Box 19- ). It is marked by a later onset than other anxiety disorders (Kessler et al. 2005) and is associated with fluctuations in symptom severity and impairment (e.g., Wittchen et al. 2000). It demonstrates both a low probability of recovery (32%–58%) and a high likelihood of recurrence (45%–52%) (Rodriguez et al. 2006) over a 2- to 12-year period. GAD is associated with significant disability and impairment comparable to pure major depressive disorder (Hoffman et al. 2008) and can be more debilitating than pure substance use disorders, some anxiety disorders, and personality disorders, even after controlling for sociodemographic variables and comorbid conditions (Grant et al. 2005). DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Generalized Anxiety Disorder 300.02 F41.1 Excessive anxiety and worry (apprehensive expectation), occurring more days than not for at least 6 months, about a number of events or activities (such as work or school performance). The individual finds it difficult to control the worry. The anxiety and worry are associated with three (or more) of the following six symptoms (with at least some symptoms having been present for more days than not for the past 6 months): Note: Only one item is required in children. Restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge. Being easily fatigued. Difficulty concentrating or mind going blank. Irritability. Muscle tension. Sleep disturbance (difficulty falling or staying asleep, or restless, unsatisfying sleep). The anxiety, worry, or physical symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The disturbance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism). The disturbance is not better explained by another mental disorder (e.g., anxiety or worry about having panic attacks in panic disorder, negative evaluation in social anxiety disorder [social phobia], contamination or other obsessions in obsessive-compulsive disorder, separation from attachment figures in separation anxiety disorder, reminders of traumatic events in posttraumatic stress disorder, gaining weight in anorexia nervosa, physical complaints in somatic symptom disorder, perceived appearance flaws in body dysmorphic disorder, having a serious illness in illness anxiety disorder, or the content of delusional beliefs in schizophrenia or delusional disorder). Individuals with GAD attempt to enhance their sense of control or preparedness through anticipation of negative outcomes or worst-case scenarios. They scan their environment for potential danger and negatively interpret neutral or ambiguous stimuli as threatening (Mathews and MacLeod 1994). Because of their lack of present moment focus, these individuals tend to ignore information in their immediate surroundings that could potentially challenge their distorted views (Borkovec and Newman 1998), which triggers emotional distress. This emotional distress is associated with many somatic features, including restlessness, fatigue, irritability, concentration difficulties, muscle tension, and sleep disturbance. Overall, GAD is a serious and costly mental illness with regard to degree of distress, disability and subsequent loss of work productivity, and quality of life (Newman 2000). Thus, targeted interventions are necessary to effectively address core symptoms and associated features. In this chapter we discuss several empirically established approaches to treatment for GAD, including conventional cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), pharmacotherapy, psychodynamic psychotherapy, and integrative psychotherapy.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Parasomnias are disorders that may appear during sleep with and/or without dreams. To describe them we must take in account a subjective description by the patient and his relatives. Objective measurement of this phenomenology is made with Polysomnography, Electromyography and Holter EKG. Material and Methods: We searched the recent data about parasomnia in the Medline, Pubmed, Google academic databases as also in classic books and reviews. Results: The clinical picture is various from motor and neurological signs to autonomic signs as also sleep related hallucinations. There are more rare presentations with associated disorders due to excretion and involuntary urinary emission during sleep disorders. Parasomnias are often preceded by a traumatic event for the patient and his family members which can be a head trauma or an infection or an intoxication which can be accompanied by psycho vulnerable events. On the other part parasomnias can be themselves a preamble announcing neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson disease, Lewy Body Dementia or some synucleopathies. Conclusions: The fluctuations of neurotransmitters (Dopamine, Serotonine or Acetylcholine) due to specific neurologic pathology can lead to particular parasomnias, their evolution corresponding to each impairment. The knowledge of accompanying parasomnias of neurologic disorders like those from Parkinson disease helps manage diseases of neurological patients already known with Parkinson's disease or other neurological diseases, leading to increased quality of life for these patients as a result of specialized intervention.",

It overlaps with frontal brain aging consequences. Moreover, somatic problems can interfere with a loss of motivation; loss of motivation is frequent with exhausting chronic diseases, cognitive impairment and it facilitates the social withdrawal. In elderly, loss of motivation blunts the intensity of moral pain. Depressions with conative disorders can move in a dysexecutive syndrome. Even if, owing to the treatment, the cognitive disorders disappear, several years after, an authentic dementia can be diagnosed. With aging process, elderly must cope with losses, less or more balanced: affective, physical and financial losses, triggering the reject of any personal commitment. Aging process also concerns brain amines, especially dopamine, exposing old persons to depression. It alters by a similar way others brain neuro-mediator, such acetylcholine, involved in dementia. Both loss motivation and executive disorders have to be systematically assessed. An antidepressant therapeutic is necessary in case of doubt, improving patients thymic status, quality of life of patients and their family, and sometime of frontal dysfunctions.",

      "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a major public health problem. Cognitive deficits are common with DM which range from subclinical or subtle to severe deficits such as dementia. Both hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia are causes of cognitive impairment with DM. In patients with DM, not only severe hypoglycaemia but also recurrent mild or moderate hypoglyacemia have deleterious effect on the brain. Recurrent mild/moderate hypoglycaemia is associated with intellectual decline, reduced attention, impaired mental abilities and memory deficits. Hypoglycaemia may result in abnormalities of neuronal plasticity, synaptic weakening and scattered neuronal death in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Chronic hyperglycaemia in type 1 and type 2 DM is associated with low IQ (verbal, performance and total) and abnormalities in testing for different domains of cognitive function such as verbal relations, comprehension, visual reasoning, pattern analysis, quantitation, memory, learning, mental control, psychomotor efficiency, mental and motor processing speed and executive function. The suggested mechanisms incriminated in the pathogenesis of hyperglycaemia-related cognitive dysfunction include, macro- and microvascular disease or vasculopathy, hyperlipidaemia, hypertension, insulin resistance and hyperinsulinaemia, stress response, direct toxic effect of chronic hyperglycaemia on the brain, advanced glycation end-products, inflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress. Hyperglycaemia causes oxidative stress, amyloidosis, angiopathy, abnormal lipid peroxidation, accumulation of β-amyloid and tau phosphorylation, neuro-inflammation, mitochondrial pathology, apoptosis and neuronal degeneration in the cortex and hippocampus. Depression has been identified as a risk for accelerated cognitive decline with DM. The knowledge that diagnosis at an early age, frequency of hypoglycaemia, poor glycaemic control and presence of risk factors negatively affect cognitive functions in DM will have important implications for treatment and research purposes.",

      "abstract": "BREATH-HOLDING spells are defined as a temporary interruption of respiration at the end of the expiratory phase, leading to mild cyanosis, unconsciousness, or convulsive seizures of either a tonic or clonic nature. In their developmental sequence there is at first crying, then a long, sustained expiratory cry without a succeeding inspiration; cyanosis replaces the previous flushing of the face (although sometimes pallor is more marked than cyanosis); then there is a stiffening of the limbs, usually in extension, followed by loss of consciousness, relaxation, inspiration, and, in a short time, recovery. In some cases, loss of consciousness is followed by generalized clonic movements of the extremities. In nearly all cases, the precipitating factor is either injury or frustration and the resulting anger, or a combination of both. The spells are said to be an early infantile form of temper tantrum—a primitive expression of anger or frustration. Such being the case,",

      "abstract": "Understanding the particular pharmacology of different antidepressant drugs can help explain their adverse effects when they are discontinued. For all antidepressant drugs, abruptly stopping them can sometimes result in “rebound” hypomania or mania. Antidepressant drugs having anticholinergic effects often are associated with a discontinuation syndrome characterized by cholinergic rebound, with symptoms of nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramping, sweating, headache, and muscle spasms. Discontinuation of monoamine oxidase inhibitor drugs sometimes results in flu-like symptoms, dysphoria, restlessness, tachycardia, hypertension, and a delirium-like state. Serotonergic antidepressant drugs are sometimes associated with a distinct discontinuation syndrome characterized by dizziness, weakness, nausea, headache, lethargy, insomnia, anxiety, poor concentration, and paresthesias. Adverse discontinuation effects can occur with all types of antidepressant drugs, but only rarely would they be considered serious. To minimize adverse discontinuation effects and to reduce the risk of relapse or recurrence of the underlying treated condition, tapering antidepressant medication is prudent for all patients.",

Seorang wanita usia 24 tahun datang ke poliklinik Rumah Sakit Jiwa Provinsi Lampung dengan keluhan utama merasa sedih yang berlebihan sejak tiga minggu yang lalu setelah dirinya didiagnosis menderita kista folikuler oleh dokter spesialis kandungan. Pasien telah mendapatkan penjelasan bahwa kista tersebut dapat sembuh sendiri apabila pasien memiliki anak lagi, namun pasien tetap merasa khawatir dan tidak bisa melawan rasa sedihnya ketika mengingat kondisinya tersebut. Pasien juga menjadi malas bekerja dan beraktivitas, lebih sering di rumah, dan mengalami gangguan tidur, sakit kepala, serta pegal-pegal pada tubuhnya. Pada pemeriksaan fisik tidak didapatkan kelainan klinis sedangkan pada pemeriksaan psikiatri didapatkan gangguan berupa mood hipotimia dengan afek yang sempit dan serasi, tidak didapatkan gangguan isi pikir dan tidak didapatkan gangguan persepsi.

The decline cannot only affect emotional abilities, but must also interfere with work or social activities.

Objetivo. Revision bibliografica sobre las complicaciones de la ECP en la EP. Desarrollo. Las complicaciones de la ECP ocurren en todas las etapas del procedimiento: antes, durante y despues de la cirugia (en el postoperatorio inmediato y remoto). En la precirugia el aspecto mas importante es la seleccion del candidato apropiado, no solo referido a beneficio sintomatico, sino tambien en cuanto a conocer su estado cognitivo y comorbilidades. Durante la cirugia la complicacion mas grave y temida es la hemorragia cerebral. En el postoperatorio las complicaciones pueden relacionarse con la intervencion (por ejemplo, sindrome confusional en el postoperatorio inmediato), con la estimulacion (contracciones musculares tonicas, desviacion ocular, midriasis, hipersudoracion hemicorporal, empeoramiento de la acinesia, alteraciones de determinadas areas cognitivas o conductuales), con el sistema implantado (rotura de electrodos, desconexion, desplazamientos, infecciones), con cambios en la medicacion (por ejemplo, depresion) o con cambios en la funcionalidad y otras de origen desconocido (como aumento de peso).

      "abstract": "A neuropsychiatric and -psychological update of the crime \"profile\" and \"signature\" is a necessary addition to the traditional sociopsychological model likely to miss limbic system dysfunctioning. Thus, occurrence of a brief (c. 20 minutes) limbic seizure has been proposed based on behaviors of 12 white male homicidal loners, who showed a dozen symptoms and signs: Limbic Psychotic Trigger Reaction. Readily overlooked can be (a) a transient psychosis (hallucinations and/or delusions), (b) autonomic hyperactivation (e.g., loss of bladder control, nausea, ejaculation), (c) motiveless, out-of-character, unplanned, and well-remembered homicidal acts, (d) committed with a flat affect (not emotionally or impulsively provoked), (e) typically involving a stranger who happened to provide an objectively harmless and only subjectively important stimulus. (f) Such an individualized stimulus triggered the memory revival of mild to moderate but repeatedly experienced hurts. Such a specific sequence of events implicates the specific mechanism of limbic seizure, \"kindling,\" which does not necessarily involve motor convulsions. Repetition of such limbic episodes with \"criminal acts\" is conceivable under specific circumstances including cases in which the triggering stimulus is associated with pleasurable delusions (e.g., of grandiose power or wealth) or constitutes a specific aspect of a basic drive motive.

It was first described in 1875 by Kahlbaum (1) who reported 25 patients with a \"brain disease\" characterized by four of the following signs: long periods of immobility, mutism alternating with verbigeration, staring, withdrawal and refusal to eat or drink, negativism, posturing and grimacing, echolalia, echopraxia, stereotypy, and waxy flexibility (see Table 1). Kahlbaum observed that these otherwise immobile patients could become very agitated or excited and were often found to have extremes of mood disturbance in the form of \"melancholy\" or \"mania.\" This phenomenon of marked, polar alterations in the predominant psychomotor state eventually led to division of the syndrome into retarded and excited types (2). The excited form has been much more difficult to characterize and distinguish from mania (3). In rare instances, patients with severe motor excitement develop fever, autonomic disturbances, stupor, and rhabdomyolysis and may succumb to cardiovascular collapse. This clinical state has been referred to as lethal or malignant catatonia (4,5) and the clinical and laboratory similarities to neuroleptic malignant syndrome (NMS) has generated considerable interest and discussion (6,7).",

      "title": "Poor insight and psychosis",
      "abstract": "A variety of phenomena might be considered as reflecting impaired insight in psychosis, like failure to recognize signs, symptoms or disease, failure to derive appropriate cognitive representations, despite recognition of the disease, and misattribution of the source or cause of the disease. The unawareness of tardive dyskinesia symptoms in schizophrenic patients points that self-awareness deficits in schizophrenia may be domain specific. Poor insight is an independent phenomenological and a prevalent feature in psychotic disorders in general, and in schizophrenia in particular, but we don't know yet if delusions in schizophrenia are the result of an entirely normal attempt to account for abnormal perceptual experiences or a product of abnormal experience but of normal reasoning. The theoretical approaches regarding impaired insight include the disturbed perceptual input, the impaired linkage between thought and emotion and the breakdown of the process of self-monitoring and error checking. The inability to distinguish between internally and externally generated mental events has been described by the metarepresentation theory. This theory includes the awareness of ones' goals, which leads to disorders of willed action, the awareness of intention, which leads to movement disorders, and the awareness of intentions of others, which leads to paranoid delusions. The theory of metarepresentation implies mainly output mechanisms, like the frontal cortex, while the input mechanism implies posterior brain systems, including the parietal lobe. There are many similarities between the disturbances of awareness seen in schizophrenia and those seen as a result of known neurological impairment. Neuropsychological models of impaired insight typically attribute the disturbance to any of a variety of core deficits in the processing of information. In this respect, lack of insight is on conceptual par with alogia, apraxia or aphasia in reflecting disturbed cognitive processing. In this direction, research have implicated the role of self-monitoring in disorders of awareness and many of the core symptoms of schizophrenia, and has been suggested that these symptoms are the result of a disturbance of a medial frontal system involving anterior hippocampus, cingulated gyrus, supplementary motor area, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Poor insight seems to be something more than a symptom or an epi-phenomenon and its mechanism may constitute a core factor into the psychosis process. Also, poor insight would be involves a common mechanism for many other mental disorders or even it would be an independent and trans-diagnostic factor into the human personality, probably like the dimension of psychotism.",

      "abstract": "Intracranial hypotension usually arises in the context of known or suspected leak of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). This leakage leads to a fall in intracranial CSF pressure and CSF volume. The most common clinical manifestation of intracranial hypotension is orthostatic headache. Post-dural puncture headache and CSF fistula headache are classified along with headache attributed to spontaneous intracranial hypotension as headache attributed to low CSF pressure by the International Classification of Headache Disorders. Headache attributed to low CSF pressure is usually but not always orthostatic. The orthostatic features at its onset can become less prominent over time. Other manifestations of intracranial hypotension are nausea, spine pain, neck stiffness, photophobia, hearing abnormalities, tinnitus, dizziness, gait unsteadiness, cognitive and mental status changes, movement disorders and upper extremity radicular symptoms. There are two presumed pathophysiologic mechanisms behind the development of various manifestations of intracranial hypotension. Firstly, CSF loss leads to downward shift of the brain causing traction on the anchoring and supporting structures of the brain. Secondly, CSF loss results in compensatory meningeal venodilation. Headaches presenting acutely after an intervention or trauma that is known to cause CSF leakage are easy to diagnose. However, a high degree of suspicion is required to make the diagnosis of spontaneous intracranial hypotension and understanding various neurological symptoms of intracranial hypotension may help clinicians.

      "abstract": "Dreaming is the mental activity of REM (and less commonly NREM) sleep.It is characterised by a perception of self, inner and outer world that is distinct from that of wakefulness.Neurophysiological and neuroimaging studies suggest that dreaming arises from activation of brainstem, thalamo-limbic and medial temporo-occipital areas and inactivation of dorsolateral prefrontal areas.Dream abnormalities in neurological disorders have poorly been studied.They include a reduction/cessation of dreaming (Charcot-Wilbrand syndrome), an increase in dream frequency, changes in dream contents and accompaniments (including REM sleep behaviour disorder) and the occurrence of dream-like experiences (hallucinations) during wakefulness and wake-sleep/sleep-wake transitions.Dream changes in association with neurological conditions including primary sleep disorders (e.g.narcolepsy, REM sleep behaviour disorder [RBD], nightmares), stroke and Parkinson's syndrome are reviewed.Assessment of altered dreaming and dreamlike experiences can be of clinical significance because of their diagnostic and therapeutic implications (RBD, hallucinations), prognostic significance (hallucinations) and distress that they can have for patients and their bed partners (e.g.nightmares, hallucinations, RBD).In addition, systematic studies of dream and dream-like experiences are expected to offer unique insights into the brain, mind and emotions of neurological patients.",

      "title": "The ICSD-3 and DSM-5 guidelines for diagnosing narcolepsy: clinical relevance and practicality",
      "abstract": "Narcolepsy is a chronic neurological disease manifesting as difficulty with maintaining continuous wake and sleep. Clinical presentation varies but requires excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) occurring alone or together with features of rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep dissociation (e.g., cataplexy, hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations, sleep paralysis), and disrupted nighttime sleep. Narcolepsy with cataplexy is associated with reductions of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hypocretin due to destruction of hypocretin peptide-producing neurons in the hypothalamus in individuals with a specific genetic predisposition. Updated diagnostic criteria include the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition (DSM-5) and International Classification of Sleep Disorders Third Edition (ICSD-3). DSM-5 criteria require EDS in association with any one of the following: (1) cataplexy; (2) CSF hypocretin deficiency; (3) REM sleep latency ≤15 minutes on nocturnal polysomnography (PSG); or (4) mean sleep latency ≤8 minutes on multiple sleep latency testing (MSLT) with ≥2 sleep-onset REM-sleep periods (SOREMPs). ICSD-3 relies more upon objective data in addition to EDS, somewhat complicating the diagnostic criteria: 1) cataplexy and either positive MSLT/PSG findings or CSF hypocretin deficiency; (2) MSLT criteria similar to DSM-5 except that a SOREMP on PSG may count as one of the SOREMPs required on MSLT; and (3) distinct division of narcolepsy into type 1, which requires the presence of cataplexy or documented CSF hypocretin deficiency, and type 2, where cataplexy is absent, and CSF hypocretin levels are either normal or undocumented. We discuss limitations of these criteria such as variability in clinical presentation of cataplexy, particularly when cataplexy may be ambiguous, as well as by age; multiple and/or invasive CSF diagnostic test requirements; and lack of normative diagnostic test data (e.g., MSLT) in certain populations. While ICSD-3 criteria reflect narcolepsy pathophysiology, DSM-5 criteria have greater clinical practicality, suggesting that valid and reliable biomarkers to help standardize narcolepsy diagnosis would be welcomed.",

      "abstract": "There is often difficulty differentiating between psychosomatic, somatopsychic, multisystem illness, and different degrees of medical uncertainty. Uncommon, complex, and multisystem diseases are commonly misdiagnosed. Two case histories are described, and relevant terms differentiating psychosomatic, somatopsychic, and multisystem illnesses are identified, reviewed, and discussed. Adequate differentiation requires an understanding of the mind/body connection, which includes knowledge of general medicine, psychiatry, and the systems linking the body and the brain. A psychiatric diagnosis cannot be given solely based upon the absence of physical, laboratory, or pathological findings. Medically unexplained symptoms, somatoform disorder, and compensation neurosis are outdated and/or inaccurate terms. The terms subjective, nonspecific, and vague can be used inaccurately. Conversion disorders, functional disorders, psychogenic illness, factitious disorder imposed upon another (Munchausen’s syndrome by proxy), somatic symptom disorder, psychogenic seizures, psychogenic pain, psychogenic fatigue, and delusional parasitosis can be over-diagnosed. Bodily distress disorder and bodily distress syndrome are scientifically unsupported and inaccurate. Many “all in your head” conditions may be related to the microbiome and the immune system. Better education concerning the interface between medicine and psychiatry and the associated diagnostic nomenclature as well as utilizing clinical judgment and thorough assessment, exercising humility, and maintaining our roots in traditional medicine will help to improve diagnostic accuracy and patient trust.",

      "abstract": "Religious experience is brain-based, like all human experience. Clues to the neural substrates of religious-numinous experience may be gleaned from temporolimbic epilepsy, near-death experiences, and hallucinogen ingestion. These brain disorders and conditions may produce depersonalization, derealization, ecstasy, a sense of timelessness and spacelessness, and other experiences that foster religious-numinous interpretation. Religious delusions are an important subtype of delusional experience in schizophrenia, and mood-congruent religious delusions are a feature of mania and depression. The authors suggest a limbic marker hypothesis for religious-mystical experience. The temporolimbic system tags certain encounters with external or internal stimuli as depersonalized, derealized, crucially important, harmonious, and/or joyous, prompting comprehension of these experiences within a religious framework.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is defined as difficulty with the initiation, maintenance, duration or quality of sleep which affects daytime functioning. About one third of world population suffer from insomnia. It can be classified by various ways i.e. primary or secondary; transient, short term or chronic insomnia; or difficulty in onset or difficulties in maintaining sleep. The derangement of various neurotransmitters e.g. histamine, orexins, noradrenaline, acetylcholine and serotonin leads to insomnia. Predisposing conditions leading to insomnia are familial or genetic tendency, illness, stress and maladaptive sleep habits. Insomnia leads to chronic fatigue, inattention, irritability, emotional outbursts, absence from work, diminished productivity, risk of accidents and other health related problems. The treatment options for insomnia include cognitive behavioural therapy, pharmacological therapy and combined approach. Cognitive behavioural therapy includes stimulus control therapy, sleep restriction therapy, relaxation therapy, sleep hygiene and cognitive therapy. The pharmacological options currently widely in use are benzodiazepines and Z-drugs. Alternative drug delivery methods and innovative treatments hold promise for increasing access to care and accelerating improvement. The newer targets for treatment of insomnia are orexin receptors, melatonin receptors and serotonin receptors. A combined approach of pharmacological treatment, cognitive behavioural treatment and newer formulations for improving drug delivery is required to combat the problem of insomnia.",

Breath-holding spells (BHS), tics, syncope, gastroesophageal reflux (GER), and sleep disturbances all may be mistaken for seizures, but important distinguishing features can help the clinician differentiate these entities from a true seizure.\n\nLike seizures, seizure-like states are paroxysmal events that have a discrete onset, ending, and return to baseline. The duration, frequency, and clinical characteristics are different for each entity and help the clinician distinguish among them, usually on the basis of history and physical examination, sometimes with the aid of additional diagnostic testing.\n\nSeizures are disturbances of the central nervous system characterized by phenomena that the patient cannot control, with or without a concurrent loss of consciousness. There may be major motor manifestations. The range of clinical seizures extends from subtle behavioral arrests (absence seizures) to the more obvious generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Generally, consciousness is lost, and the postictal period of drowsiness or decreased responsiveness following the episode often lasts 21/2 times the length of the actual paroxysm. If the paroxysm is momentary, a postictal period may not be identifiable.\n\nBHS are common, peaking in children between 2 and 3 years of age, although even infants may have them. Commonly, those who hold their breath outgrow their spells by 5 or 6 years of age. BHS are characterized by the child’s apparent inability to breathe, accompanied by a change in color, limpness, and collapse, followed briefly by a return to baseline. The duration usually is less than 1 minute. Generalized tonic movements from brief cerebral ischemia may accompany BHS, but do not imply any increased risk of epilepsy in the future. Clinically, BHS can be categorized as pallid or cyanotic. The parents often describe the child as becoming frustrated and crying prior to cyanotic episodes and having suffered minor trauma, …",

The clinical picture of seizure headaches includes the following features: they are usually diffuse or bifrontal; they begin abruptly at any time and last for minutes or several hours; in the majority of cases they are accompanied by nausea and vomiting and followed by postictal lethargy or sleep; there are no precipitating factors; they respond to anticonvulsants. The factors which differentiate between seizure headache and migraine are discussed. Seizure headache can be the sole clinical manifestation of seizure foci in the limbic system and other parts of the cortex. Some of these patients will have other autonomic phenomena such as pallor and abdominal pain; nearly all have nausea and vomiting. RÉSUMÉ Six cas de céphalées paroxystiques chez l'enfant, provenant de troubles comitiaux sont présentés. L'allure clinique des cephalées critiques présente les caractères suivants: elles sont habituellement diffuses ou bi‐frontales, elles commencent brutalement à n'importe quel moment et durent de quelques minutes à plusieurs heures. Dans la majorité des cas, elles sont accompagnées de nausées et de vomissements et suivies d'une léthargie post‐critique ou de sommeil; il n'y a pas de facteurs annonciateurs; les médications anticomitiales sont actives. Les facteurs qui différencient céphalées critiques et migraines sont discutés. Les céphalées critiques peuvent être la seule manifestation clinique de foyer comitial dans le système limbique et les autres parties du cortex. Quelques sujets présentent d'autres manifestations végétatives telles que pâleurs et douleurs abdominales. Presque tous ont des nausées et des vomissements. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Es wird über sechs Kinder mit paroxysmalen Kopfschmerzen infolge eines Krampfleidens berichtet. Das klinische Bild der Krampf‐Kopfschmerzen bietet folgende charakteristischen Befunde: Die Schmerzen sind gewöhnlich diffus oder bifrontal, sie beginnen abrupt, können zu jeder Zeit auftreten und dauern Minuten bis einige Stunden an. In der Mehrzahl der Fälle klagen die Patienten über Übelkeit, erbrechen und fallen anschliessend in einen postiktalen Dämmerzustand oder Schlaf; es gibt keine ursächlichen Faktoren; die Kopfschmerzen sprechen auf die Behandlung mit Antikonvulsiva an. Auf die unterschiedlichen Befunde bei krampfbedingten Kopfschmerzen und bei Migräne wird ausführlich eingegangen. Krampfebedingte Kopfschmerzen können die einzige klinische Manifestation von Krampffoci im limbischen System und anderen Teilen des Cortex sein. Bei einigen Patienten treten auch andere vegetative Symptome wie Blässe und Bauchschmerzen auf. Nahezu alle Kinder Klagen über Übelkeit und Erbrechen.

      "title": "Pharmacotherapy of Insomnia",
      "abstract": "As insomnia is a common symptom caused by diverse disorders, treatment tools for the insomnia differ depending on the underlying cause. Hypnotics can be used for primary insomnia. As hypnotics show excellent short-term efficacy, they would be useful as short-term (< 4 weeks) treatments for transient insomnia. There has been much controversy over long-term hypnotic use for chronic insomnia. Evidence supporting safety and efficacy of the long-term hypnotic use is insufficient. Therefore, rather than using hypnotics alone, non-pharmacological treatments are recommended more for chronic primary insomnia. Although various benzodiazepines have widely been used as hypnotics, there have been concerns over tolerance, rebound insomnia, dependency, cognitive decline and psychomotor slowness. In efforts to relieve these concerns, selective benzodiazepine agonists like zolpidem have been introduced as novel hypnotics. Sedating antidepressants, melatonin and anti-histamine have also been used in order to manage insomnia. However, their efficacy for primary insomnia has yet to be proven.",

      "title": "Agitation und Aggression in der Psychiatrie",
      "abstract": "Akute Agitation und Aggression zählen mit einer Prävalenz mit über 10 % zu den häufigsten medizinischen Notfallsituationen in der Psychiatrie [1]. Fast jeder zweite Patient, der in eine psychiatrische Notaufnahme kommt, weist Symptome von Agitation auf. Im deutschsprachigen Raum wird unter Agitation in der Regel ein Syndrom verstanden, das durch psychomotorische Unruhe, Erregung und Gespanntheit gekennzeichnet ist und das von stillem Negativismus bis hin zur Hostilität reichen kann [2]. Diese können in wechselnder Ausprägung und in der Intensität rasch veränderlich vorliegen. Häufig wird weitgehend synonym, aber doch mit etwas anderem Schwerpunkt der Begriff (psychomotorischer) Erregungszustand verwendet, der vor allem durch eine ausgeprägte Antriebssteigerung sowie motorische Hyperaktivität gekennzeichnet ist. Sowohl Agitation als auch psychomotorischer Erregungszustand können schließlich mit Gereiztheit, Aggressivität und Kontrollverlust einhergehen. In der angloamerikanischen Literatur wird Agitation dagegen besonders durch ausgeprägte motorische oder verbale Hyperaktivität oder durch Reizbarkeit und unkooperatives Verhalten charakterisiert [3], ein Bild, das eher dem (psychomotorischen) Erregungszustand nach deutschem Verständnis entspricht. Konkrete Anzeichen von Agitation sind z. B. motorische Unruhe, Hin-und-Her-Gehen, intensives Gestikulieren, laute Sprache mit Drohgebärden, Reizbarkeit, Impulsivität sowie mangelnde Kooperation. Die Übergänge zwischen Agitation und Aggression sind fließend. Mündet Agitation in Aggression, kann sich daraus eine akute Gefährdung des Patienten oder seines sozialen Umfelds entwickeln [4]. Aggression umfasst jegliche Form von verbalem, nonverbalem oder körperlichem Verhalten, das für den Patienten selbst, für andere Personen oder für deren Eigentum bedrohlich ist. Agitiertes Verhalten führt häufig zu Aggression und Gewalt. Bei psychiatrischen Patienten wird in bis zu über 80 % der Gewaltdelikte agitiertes Verhalten beobachtet. Insbesondere unbehandelte, junge, männliche Patienten mit Psychosen gelten als Hochrisikogruppe, vor allem, wenn komorbider Substanzmissbrauch hinzukommt [5].",

En esta revision, hacemos un repaso del complejo proceso de la cognicion asi como de los distintos elementos que lo integran. Asimismo, revisamos los mecanismos mediante los que el dolor cronico puede afectar el proceso de la cognicion y el modo en el que este puede verse afectado por la concurrencia de otras patologias, o por los farmacos habitualmente utilizados para su tratamiento. Finalmente se plantea la necesidad de evaluar el deterioro cognitivo en los pacientes con dolor cronico, con el objetivo de evitar la progresion de la enfermedad cognitiva hacia un cuadro de deterioro mas grave, asi como de contribuir a mejorar la respuesta terapeutica al dolor y el aumento de la calidad de vida de los pacientes. EnglishChronic pain constitutes a serious public health problem due to its high prevalence and the social and personal consequences. The presence of chronic pain has been associated with mild cognitive impairment, especially in patients with fibromyalgia and neuropathic pain, and it has been also related with other disease like anxiety, depression, sleep disorders and the use of certain drugs, usually taken on these patients. This document revises the complex issue of the cognitive process and the several elements that comprise it. Likewise, we review the different mechanisms by which pain affect cognitive process and the way it could be affected by other disease, or by drugs commonly used on treatment. It is necessary to assess mild cognitive impairment on chronic pain patients, in order to prevent the develop and the evolution of cognitive disease to a more severe impairment, as well as help to improve therapeutic response to pain and increase health related quality of life of patients.",

      "title": "Panic Attacks in the Natural Environmet",
      "abstract": "Despite much recent research, there is still little systematic information about the phenomenology of panic attacks, and their possible causes remain obscure. We investigated panic attacks in the natural environment using an event sampling approach. Twenty-seven panic attack patients and 19 matched normal conrols kept panic attack and self-exposure diaries for 6 days and wore an ambulatory heart rate/physical activity recorder for 3 days. Patients reported 175 attacks, generally of moderate severity. The most frequent symptoms were palpitations, dizziness/lightheadedness, dyspnea, nausea, sweating, and chest pain/ discomfort. The results did not support the classification of panic attacks recently proposed by Sheehan and Sheehan, which requires three symptoms as a cutoff for panic attacks. Panic attacks classified by the patients as situational (i.e., occurring in feared situations) were more severe and occurred in situational contexts different from spontaneous attacks, but were otherwise phenomenologically similar. Heart rates did not change during spontaneous attacks and were only mildly elevated during situational attacks or during the 15 minutes preceding these attacks. These heart rate changes were interpretable as effects of anxiety, although physical activity showed a similar pattern of changes. Some normal control subjects reported on the panic diary primarily situational anxiety episodes that were phenomenologically similar to, albeit less severe than, the patients' episodes. Panic patients may sometimes fail to perceive environmental triggers for their attacks because many sometimes fail to perceive environmental triggers for their attacks because many attacks classified as spontaneous occurred in classical \"phobic\" situations. Furthermore, the comparison of concurrent diary and retrospective interview and questionnaire descriptions showed that panic patients have a tendency toward retrospective exaggeration. Implications for the assessment, definition, and classification of panic attacks are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is a disorder which occurs in a large number of people, it can have a lot of different causes. Short lasting (acute) insomnias are mostly results of stressful situations which a person experiences in his or hers life, and they usually end when the source of the stress is removed. Chronic insomias have different causes and they are frequently associated with psyhological problems. Treatment of insomnia, depending on the severity, cause and the individual patient, can be simple or very complicated. Acute insomnia usually doesn't require special therapy, or if therapy is needed it is not long lasting and usually it doesn't show severe complications with it's use. Chronic insomnia can have different causes and it's therapy is usually long lasting. Pharmacotherapeutic possibilities of insomia treatment are usually based on administration of benzodiazepine receptor antagonists (benzodiazepines and Z-drugs), but there are other options, such as antidepressants, ramelteon, melatonin, valerian, H1-antihistaminics and L-tryptophan. Benzodiazepine receptor antagonists show good results in shortening sleep onset latency, sleep duaration and sleep quality. Problems with the use of bendodiazepine receptor agonists are shown in daytime simptoms (fatigue, hangovers, restlessness) and the possibility of tolerance and dependence after longer use. Non pharmacological treatment are thought of as different methods of psyhological bihevioral therapy. The advantage here is that they show good results in shortening sleep onset latency, sleep duaration and sleep quality, and they are safe as a long term therapy option. The problem with this type of therapy is that it is expensive, it requiers specially trained experts and it doesn't show immediate results. Combined therapy has all the advantages of psyhological bihevioral therapy, with avoiding side effects which occure with pharmacological treatments. Alternative methods, such as acupuncture, acupressure, yoga and tay-chi are other methods of insomnia treatment, but there are not a lot of studies in this field, and the ones that have been made have inconsistent results. When choosing a therapy option, one should always have in mind that it can be long lasting, and therefore the individuality of each patient should get the most attention, so the best possible, but affordable option can be determined.",

Many children and adolescents describe psychotic-like experiences, which can be associated with other types of psychopathology and past experiences (e.g., trauma, substance use, and suicidality). However, most youth reporting such experiences do not have, nor will ever develop, schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder. Accurate assessment is critical because these different presentations have different diagnostic and treatment implications. For this review, we focus primarily on the diagnosis and treatment of early onset schizophrenia. In addition, we review the development of community-based first-episode psychosis programming, and the importance of early intervention and coordinated care.",

The main symptom of insomnia is insufficient sleep to carry out the full range of daily functions. The patient who sleeps for only 5 hours a night, but is not sleepy during the day, is a 'short sleeper' and not an insomniac. Primary insomniacs have a good response to hypnotics, but feel out of control if they use them continuously. Two components are involved in maintaining the insomnia - a psychological anxiety and a physiological response to this anxiety, including raised muscle tone and respiratory rate. A behavioural regimen based on a cognitive-behavioural approach designed to improve sleep quality gradually over a period of 4 - 6 weeks is often helpful. A hypnotic can be prescribed for use every third night during this regimen - zolpidem and zopiclone are preferred. Referral to a sleep specialist may be necessary if this approach does not work.",

Key questions regarding 5-HT markers include whether receptors directly or indirectly participate and/or contribute to the physiological and pharmacological basis of memory and its pathogenesis; hence, the major aim of this article was to examine recent advances in emergent targets of the 5-HT systems for memory formation and memory alterations. Recent reviews and findings are summarized, mainly in the context of the growing notion of memory deficits in brain disorders (e.g., posttraumatic stress disorder, mild cognitive impairment, consumption of drugs, poststroke cognitive dysfunctions, schizophrenia, Parkinson disease, and infection-induced memory impairments). Mainly, mammalian and (some) human data were the focus. At least agonists and antagonists for 5-HT1A/1B, 5-HT2A/2B/2C, 5-HT3, 5-HT4, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 receptors as well as serotonin uptake inhibitors seem to have a promnesic and/or antiamnesic effect in different conditions and 5-HT markers seem to be associated to neural changes. Available evidence offers clues about the possibilities, but the exact mechanisms remain unclear. For instance, 5-HT transporter expression seems to be a reliable neural marker related to memory mechanisms and its alterations.",

Mood disorders are remarkably diverse in their features but they share a focus on an excessive mood that colors and distorts the way the person thinks and views the world, accompanied by marked changes in movement, activity, energy, sleep, appetite, and motivation for engagement in the world. Depressive disorders are so frequent that they have been called the common cold of psychological disorders but, unlike the common cold, their consequences can be profoundly distressing, disruptive, and impairing. Included within this chapter will be current research and the prevailing theories regarding the phenomenology, etiology, and pathology of unipolar depressive disorders (e.g., major depressive disorder and dysthymia) and bipolar mood disorders (e.g., bipolar I, bipolar II, and cyclothymia).",

Ils se plaignent rarement de dépression, mais surtout d'un sentiment de \"vide\" et de tension. Ils sont sujets à des changements d'humeur subits et imprévisibles, ce qui se traduit par une forte tendance de la part des médecins, à diagnostiquer des désordres de la personnalité en termes souvent péjoratifs. Ces patients ont souvent des intérêts médicaux importants ou des occupations paramédicales. Plusieurs d'entre eux se plaignent de symptômes d'inappétence (anoxérie ou excès d'appétit ou encore des combinaisons de l'une et de l'autre), d'usage de la drogue ou d'abus de l'alcool; ils sont portés aux troubles sexuels, à l'angoisse, à la promiscuité. Ils éprouvent plus fréquemment des réaction négatives à la puberté et à la menstruation; ils sont issus de foyer désuni et ont souffert de carence parentale. Une proportion de ce groupe éprouve des difficultés dans la communication verbale. Une tendance marquée à s'évader de l'hôpital se retrouve chez les malades hospitalises pour automutilation.

The aim of defining diagnostic criteria of hemodynamic orthostatic dizziness/vertigo is to help clinicians to understand the terminology related to orthostatic dizziness/vertigo and to distinguish orthostatic dizziness/vertigo due to global brain hypoperfusion from that caused by other etiologies. Diagnosis of hemodynamic orthostatic dizziness/vertigo requires: A) five or more episodes of dizziness, unsteadiness or vertigo triggered by arising or present during upright position, which subsides by sitting or lying down; B) orthostatic hypotension, postural tachycardia syndrome or syncope documented on standing or during head-up tilt test; and C) not better accounted for by another disease or disorder. Probable hemodynamic orthostatic dizziness/vertigo is defined as follows: A) five or more episodes of dizziness, unsteadiness or vertigo triggered by arising or present during upright position, which subsides by sitting or lying down; B) at least one of the following accompanying symptoms: generalized weakness/tiredness, difficulty in thinking/concentrating, blurred vision, and tachycardia/palpitations; and C) not better accounted for by another disease or disorder. These diagnostic criteria have been derived by expert consensus from an extensive review of 90 years of research on hemodynamic orthostatic dizziness/vertigo, postural hypotension or tachycardia, and autonomic dizziness. Measurements of orthostatic blood pressure and heart rate are important for the screening and documentation of orthostatic hypotension or postural tachycardia syndrome to establish the diagnosis of hemodynamic orthostatic dizziness/vertigo.",

Its main advantages over \"typical\" neuroleptics are low incidence of extrapyramidal side effects and its capacity to induce therapeutic response in previously treated refractory patients. However, withdrawal from clozapine has been observed to lead to \"atypical\" clinical characteristics or a \"rebound phenomenon,\" manifested in two interwoven clinical forms: (1) psychotic exacerbation, and (2) cholinergic rebound. The underlying pathophysiological mechanism of this phenomenon is postulated to be a result of cholinergic supersensitivity. In this paper, the \"rebound phenomenon\" will be discussed and exemplified by three case histories in which abrupt cessation of clozapine led to serious deterioration and psychotic exacerbation, and one case in which gradual titration from the drug was employed in order to preempt this hazardous occurrence.",

Dotyczy to głównie zaburzeń hiperkinetycznych, zachowania, osobowości borderline czy uzależnienia od substancji psychoaktywnych. Około 50% pacjentów prezentuje objawy ChAD przed 18 rokiem życia, a średni czas od ich pojawienia się do postawienia właściwej diagnozy wynosi 5-10 lat. Nierozpoznane ChAD mogą mieć negatywny wpływ na rozwój kompetencji emocjonalnych, społecznych i poznawczych co istotnie wpływa na funkcjonowanie pacjenta także w życiu dorosłym.

      "abstract": "It is no surprise that psychotropic drugs are commonly administered to with medical diseases (1, 2). First, non psychiatrist physicians often encounter emo­ tional discomfort in their with medical diseases. Surveys performed in the Unites States (3-7) and elsewhere (8-10) suggest that a high percentage of ambula­ tory individuals with medical disorders receive psychotropic drugs because of anxi­ ety or insomnia. Studies of drug dispensing patterns (9, 11, 12) indicate that the majority of psychotropic drug prescriptions are written by general practitioners, internists, and surgeons. Well over 50% of hospitalized medical receive pharmacotherapy for anxiety or insomnia (13-15). Second, a number of individuals with primary emotional disorders-particularly the elderly-have coincident medi­ cal diseases. Finally, in some medical disorders or syndromes, such as intractable hiccups or severe nausea and vomiting, a psychotropic drug (i.e. a phenothiazine) may constitute a treatment of choice (16). This pharmacologic interface of medicine and psychiatry is of considerable impor­ tance. Informed clinicians require an understanding of whether psychotropic drugs can provide symptomatic benefit for their medically ill patients with emotional distress. They should also understand whether the psychotropic drugs they adminis­ ter can influence the clinical course of the medical dise�se and, conversely, whether the response to the psychotropic agent can be affected by characteristics of the patient and the disease state. This article focuses upon such considerations.",

In obsessive compulsive disorder, patient is compelled to think the opposite of what is said (Contrast thinking). Whether same type phenomenon can occur in affective domain- compulsion to express an opposite emotion to the existing situation has not been described in literature. This case report addresses the dilemma about phenomena and nomenclature regarding above experience. Aims and methods This case report is about a 28 year old unmarried male patient who reported experiencing emotions opposite to the prevailing external circumstances i.e, uncontrollable urge to laugh in sad situations, which occurred episodically since 15 years. It was very distressing to the patient and made him anxious & sad. There were no other obsessive compulsive phenomenon. He did not have any psychotic features like delusions, hallucinations, or thought disorder. There was no decline in functioning in any spheres of his life. Differentiating this experience from inappropriate affect occurring in schizophrenia can be difficult but is essential. A provisional diagnosis of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder with features of ‘Contrast emotion’ was made and patient was advised Cap. Fluoxetine 20mg OD. Results Patient did not adhere to the pharmacological regimen advised. He came for follow up once, when he reported one more similar episode. Conclusions Abnormalities in experience and expression of emotions have to be closely analysed to delineate the phenomenon as it can have diagnostic and therapeutic implications.",

      "abstract": "Heroin is an illicit, highly addictive drug. It is either the most abused or the most rapidly acting member of opioids. Abusers describe a feeling of a surge of pleasurable sensation, named as \"rush\" or \"high\". Repeated administration of high doses of heroin results in the induction of physical dependence. Physical dependence refers to an altered physiological state produced by chronic administration of heroin which necessitates the continued administration of the drug to prevent the appearance of a characteristic syndrome, the opioid withdrawal or abstinence syndrome. Withdrawal symptoms may occur within a few hours after the last administration of heroin. Symptoms of the withdrawal include restlessness, insomnia, drug craving, diarrhea, muscle and bone pain, cold flashes with goose bumps, and leg movements. Major withdrawal symptoms peak between 48 and 72 hours after the last dose of heroin and subside after about a week. At this time, weakness and depression are pronounced and nausea and vomiting are common. Nevertheless, some chronic addicts have shown persistent withdrawal signs for many months or even years. Heroin addiction is considered as a behavioural state of compulsive drug use and a high tendency to relapse after periods of abstinence. It is generally accepted that compulsive use and relapse are typically associated with the status of heroin craving or heroin hunger that are difficult to define but appear to be powerful motivational significance in the addiction process. The route of administering heroin varies largely and may indicate the degree of seriousness of the individual's addiction. Intravenous administration seems to be the predominant method of heroin use, but recently a shift in heroin use pattern has been found, i.e. from injection to sniffing and smoking. Frequent injections coupled with widespread sharing of syringes increase the risk of contracting HIV, hepatitis B, C and other blood-borne infectious diseases. Long-term use of heroin has also severe medical consequences such as scarred veins, bacterial infections of blood vessels, liver and kidney diseases, and lung complications.",

Successful treatment of depression is a collaborative effort involving patient, family, clinician (and associates). Faith is needed, and so persuasion and the support of others surrounding the patient can have greater influence on treatment outcome than does the particular choice of pharmaceuticals or psychotherapeutic method.",

Signs and symptoms of AW can include, among others, mild to moderate tremors, irritability, anxiety, or agitation. The most severe manifestations of withdrawal include delirium tremens, hallucinations, and seizures. These manifestations result from alcohol-induced imbalances in the brain chemistry that cause excessive neuronal activity if the alcohol is withheld. Management of AW includes thorough assessment of the severity of the patient's symptoms and of any complicating conditions as well as treatment of the withdrawal symptoms with pharmacological and nonpharmacological approaches. Treatment can occur in both inpatient and outpatient settings. Recognition and treatment of withdrawal can represent a first step in the patient's recovery process.",

Only a few therapeutic strategies address both the anxiety and depressive disorders and the existing ones are far from being satisfactory due to the latency of onset of action, poor tolerability and the potential for addiction phenomena. Although part of the latest psychotropic class, Agomelatine has demonstrated efficacy on depressive symptoms and associated sleep disorders. Increasingly numerous recent studies demonstrate the anxiolytic effect of Agomelatine, both on depressive disorders associated with anxiety disorders and on anxiety symptoms ( generalized anxiety disorder).

The formal diagnostic criteria for caffeine-withdrawal headache (CWH) were given in the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 2nd edition (ICHD-II). According to these criteria, the headache is bilateral and/or pulsating, occurs when intake is interrupted or delayed in person with caffeine consumption of C200 g/day for [2 weeks, develops within 24 h after last caffeine intake and is relieved within 1 h by 100 mg of caffeine. The obligatory criterion, as for the other secondary headaches, is the improvement or resolution of headache after relief from the causative disorder, e.g. that this headache resolves within 7 days after total caffeine withdrawal. There is a comment on the possibility of this syndrome in patients on dialysis who consume large quantities of caffeine [1, 2]. We report a case of patient on hemodialysis (HD) with CWH.

      "title": "Study on Neurological Soft Signs in patients with ObsessiveCompulsive Disorder.",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:\r\nIn the era of expanding recent advancements and progress made in\r\nThe field of neuro psychiatry , a relatively neglected aspect is complete\r\nNeurological examination which is non invasive, easy to administer and\r\nProvides wealth of information regarding the various aspects of the\r\nDisease. Impaired neurological performance has been documented in\r\nVarious psychiatric conditions and the concept of neurological\r\nExamination in psychiatry ,a time old concept whose significance has\r\nGained importance with blurring of the thin line between neurology and\r\nPsychiatry leading to the concept of neuropsychiatry. Neuro biological\r\nUnderpinnings of psychiatric conditions further propelled the significance\r\nOf neurological examination in psychiatry.\r\nNeurological examination in psychiatry, particularly has two\r\nGeneral aspects\r\n1] Examination for ‘hard signs’ or ‘major signs’ or ‘localizable\r\nSigns’ such as cranial nerve lesion, motor deficit, sensory impairment,\r\nReflex asymmetry which reflects presence or absence of neuropathology\r\nAnd a localizing lesion.\r\n2] Evaluation of performance decrements in neurological domains\r\nWithout any identifiable neurological lesion or disorder (Sanders &\r\nKeshavan, 1998).\r\nAs mentioned above these decrements in neurological domains\r\nMainly includes the concept of our focus “NEUROLOGICAL SOFT\r\nSIGNS” or “SOFT NEUROLOGICAL SIGNS”.(Sanders & Keshavan,\r\n1998)\r\nNEUROLOGICAL SOFT SIGNS\r\nDr. Loretta Bender ,a pioneer in neuro psychiatric aspects of\r\nChildhood disorders introduced the concept of neurological soft signs in\r\n1947 in reference to non diagnostic neurological abnormalities seen in\r\nChildren with schizophrenia .(Sadock, Benjamin James., Sadock, 2007)\r\nDEFINITION\r\nNSS are defined by Shaffer and o’connor as\r\n“ Non normative performance (s) on a motor or sensory test(s)\r\nWhich would be identical or akin to test(s) of traditional neurological\r\nExamination, but elicited from an individual who shows none of the\r\nFeatures of fixed or transient neurological disorder ”\r\nShaffer et al also proposed that to consider a sign as an NSS it should\r\nHave following features\r\n1] No association should exist between an observed behaviour and\r\nA positive history of neurological disease or trauma\r\n2] It should not be a pathognomonic sign of any neurologic disease\r\nOr encephalopathy\r\n3] It should not be indicate any specific CNS pathology\r\nThus the NSS are minor neurological deviation in motor and sensory\r\nFunction that are not localized to any specific area of the brain and not\r\nCharacteristic of any specific neurological condition ,mostly indicating\r\nDiffuse cerebral dysfunction.\r\nEver since they have been introduced they were termed as ‘soft\r\nSigns’, ‘non focal signs’, ‘diffuse signs’, ‘minimal brain damage\r\nSyndrome’ due to their lack of specificity ,validity or localization at that\r\nTime. The term ‘soft’ also signifies the nature of wide but blurred\r\nBoundaries of varying domains like EEG findings ,behaviour disturbance,\r\nLearning disorders, neurological functions that were considered under the\r\nUmbrella of soft signs.(Sanders & Keshavan, 1998)\r\nThe initial focus of these NSS remained mainly in the field of child\r\nPsychiatry with description of concepts of ‘Minimal Brain Damage’ in\r\nChildren with hyperactivity, impulsivity and with no demonstrable\r\nNeurological lesion. Later from 1990 with quantification of validated and\r\nStandardised instruments for assessment of these signs, the focus shifted\r\nTo major psychiatric conditions leading to exhaustive research in the\r\nSubject which provided significant understanding of the neurobiology,\r\nNeuro anatomical correlates, genetic underpinnings , neuro developmental\r\nBasis, endophenotypic markers and predictors of neuropsychological\r\nDysfunction in certain psychiatric conditions.\r\nWith this brief introduction about the neurological soft signs ,we\r\nNow focus on existing documented literature that has changed the concept\r\nOf these NSS, their significance in psychiatric conditions and the various\r\nAspects of their relation to Obsessive compulsive disorder which is the\r\nMain focus of our study.",

This leads to a serious decrease in quality of life in patient and their caregivers and it can precipitate the institutionalization. Non-pharmacological therapies are of increasing importance, particularly in therapeutic options. The aim is to gain knowledge about these symptoms, the therapies mentioned above, their utility as well as to identify nursing interventions, through published literature review. In addition to cognitive deterioration other type of symptoms such as apathy, depression, agitation, aggressiveness and anxiety can appear in any stage of illness. Their frequency and intensity tend to increase as the disease progresses. Severe adverse effects associated with some medicines have given rise to non-pharmacological therapies which have been developed in recent years. Moreover, they contribute to some characteristics which are of undoubted interest to, such as no side effects. In addition to this they allow to give individualized treatment. The Nursing Interventions Classification (NIC) includes interventions that are in accordance with the therapies mentioned within the context of multidisciplinary team working. They are targeted at patient, as well as family members and caregivers.",

This would include disorders that have the common point of the presence of repetitive thoughts and actions, which may either have a <<compulsive>> or <<impulsive>> nature. Certain neurological disorders with repetitive movements have also been grouped within this spectrum, including some forms of epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, Sydenham's Chorea or Huntington's disease. There is evidence that physiopathological connections may exist between some of these conditions.A case of a patient with Huntington's Chorea with obsessive signs and symptoms is presented. The patient is a 50 year old male, diagnosed of Huntington's Chorea who is being treated with 25 mg/day of clozapine and 10 mg/day of clorazepate. The patient refused to eat certain foods for <<fear of choking>>. He began to display other obsessive behaviors such as refusing to touch objects that might have been touched by others, and developed ritual checking methods. Treatment based on the administration of 40 mg/day of paroxetine was begun. With this treatment the compulsive symptoms have disappeared, as has the fear of choking. However, the choreic movements typical of his condition persist and the signs and symptoms associated with a process of dementia are becoming increasingly evident.It is concluded that the case described may well be a good example of obsessive spectrum, and that the underlying physio-pathology should be studied.",

Permanent neurological disorders have become very common among patients treated with neuroleptics, but little effort has been made to come to grips with this problem. Neuroleptics may reduce overactivity and belligerent behavior, but these are secondary effects of a general lessening of psychopathology. Sedation occurs only in the early stages of drug therapy in certain susceptible individuals or when excessive doses are administered, particularly of chlorpromazine. The widespread prescribing of potentially dangerous drugs has been particularly evident in the field of psychopharmacology because of its role in a rapidly expanding and changing program of mental health care.

      "abstract": "In our outpatient clinic for adults with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), 10–20% of those affected repeatedly complained about abnormally extended (24 hours) or (more often) notably shortened or reduced effectiveness of local anesthesia injections for dental treatment. Some patients reported paradoxical reactions to postoperative administration of tranquillizers (including benzodiazepines). These drugs made them “even more awake”, much to their doctor’s surprise.\r\n\r\nOne female patient reported that she had followed the surgeons’ conversations during the initial 10 minutes of the operation under full anesthesia and complete muscle relaxation. The surgeons were surprised at the amount of details she remembered. In other patients, anesthetics worked for ”too long” or had “too strong an effect.”\r\n\r\nMany people with ADHD have next to no reaction or react paradoxically to caffeine (coffee/black tea/cola) and other stimulants (nicotine, “Red Bull,” amphetamines). One female patient also reported excessive awareness —and better cognition—when taking antihistamines (for example, “Fenistil” [dimethindene maleate]).\r\n\r\nSuch “idiosyncratic” reactions seem to be stable over time, which means that the different effects are predictable.\r\n\r\nWe therefore advise our ADHD patients to inform their anesthesiologist before an operation that they may react differently to caffeine, antihistamines/low-potency neuroleptics, benzodiazepines (and also central and peripheral anesthetic drugs).\r\n\r\nMany mentally healthy people also react in a primarily unexpected way to caffeine, etc. It therefore may make sense to ask patients preoperatively about untypical reactions to this (not very long) list of different substances, in order to anticipate possible intraoperative and postoperative problems and to avoid these where possible.\r\n\r\nPresumably such atypical reactions are genetically determined. Therefore “idiosyncrasies” in family members may as well provide a hint for an increased risk of abnormal reactions to anesthetics.\r\n\r\nREFERENCES",

      "title": "Approach to History Taking and Examination of the Movement Disorder Patient",
      "abstract": "Abstract Movement disorders can be classified into akinetic–rigid and hyperkinetic categories. The value of a systematic approach to history taking and examination cannot be overstated. For example, taking a detailed family and drug history, or paying close attention to the saccadic eye movements, often produces important information. Cognitive and neuropsychiatric features commonly accompany movement disorders, are often not spontaneously volunteered, and therefore should always be screened for. Sadly, there appears to be an increasing over-reliance on ordering tests indiscriminately in the diagnostic quest, often at the expense of a thorough clinical evaluation. Such an approach is likely to have a low yield, to be potentially misleading, and also to be costly. The key to accurate diagnosis lies in identifying the phenomenology of the movement disorder, set in the context of the historical information obtained (e.g. rate of onset, progression, use of offending drugs), and whether there are additional physical signs to be elicited from the general medical or neurological examination that further narrow down the differential (e.g. organomegaly, eye movement disorder, reflex changes). For intermittent, situational, or task-specific movement disorders, asking the patient to make a video recording on their mobile phone or other device can be invaluable. Alternatively, bringing the relevant piece of equipment to the consulting room (such as a golf club, guitar, etc.) can be illuminating. The implications for other family members should always be borne in mind when undertaking genetic testing.

      "abstract": "It is well known that some drugs and neurodegenerative processes, such asParkinson’s disease, can cause extrapyramidal side effects (1). Extrapyramidal symptoms (ES) may be drug-induced and due affect tolerance and compliance (2). ES includes akathisia, parkinsonian symptoms (e.g. tremor, bradykinesia and muscle rigidity) and impaired involuntary movements (e.g. acute dystonia and tardive dyskinesia) (3). Especially, antipsychotic drugs therapy (4), antiemetics, and a variety of other drugs (5) can frequently cause severe occurrences and complications (4). Some drugs induced ES are thought to causean imbalance of dopamine and acetylcholine in the nigrostriatal pathway(1). Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), such as amitriptyline, imipramine, desipramine, clomipramine and doxepine, may have antidopaminergic effect(2). However, antidepressant drugs are not directly acting as dopamine antagonists(6), but some movement disorders symptoms are rarely described as a side effect of tricyclic antidepressants(2). Enuresis nocturna is a multidisciplinary problem worked on by such many physicians as pediatricians, urologists and child and adolescent psychiatrists (7) can cause a significant psychosocial problem for children and their parents (8), which is estimated at 3.8% to 25% (9). That is, there are over 50 million children with enuresis around the world (10). Theaetiology of this condition is not totally known. Medical therapies including imipramine, desmopressin and anticholinergics, behavioural therapy and enuretic alarm devices are proposed to manage this condition(8). TCAs drugs are widely used in the process of managing this condition (11), for instance, Imipramine can reduce wetting in some children and young people (12).Unsal et al. Here we report a case of imipramine induced acute dystonia in an enuretic child. 8- year-old boy with severe torticollis was assessed in our outpatient clinic and. Beforehand, he had been diagnosed as enuresis nocturna by a child psychiatrist and was given imipramine 10 mg/day for treatment. After three days initiating imipramine 10 mg/day, he had severe muscular spasm on his neck. He had no psychiatric and neurological history. Physical examination, vital signs, serum chemistries, blood counts were within normal limits. He wasonly taking imipramine, and no other medication had been used during this three days. He was diagnosed with imipramine induced dystonia and biperiden 5 mg was administered intramusculary. After 45 minutes, it was seen that torticollis was resolved and he was referred to child psychiatry for the treatment of enuresis nocturna.",

      "title": "Night Eating Syndrome Presenting as Anorexia in an Athlete",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Night eating syndrome (NES) was first described by Stunkard in 1955 as \"morning anorexia, evening or nocturnal hyperphagia in a fully conscious state, and insomnia\" (21). Over time, the syndrome has been further characterized to distinguish it from other forms of nighttime eating. Although some debate still exists, NES encompasses a few key behaviors, including evening hyperphagia (or late night eating before initiating sleep) and eating after awakening from sleep (night eating) either in a fully or semi-conscious state (11). This is in contrast to binge eating disorder (BED), which describes episodes of consuming large quantities of food in discrete time periods without control (23), or sleep related eating disorder (SRED), which refers to involuntary nocturnal eating, often of bizarre foods or inedible items, that occurs after awakening (25). Late-night eating also can be found in other diagnoses, such as bulimia nervosa or dissociative disorders, but in these cases it is usually a part of a group of symptoms rather than the central problem. The hallmark of NES is a delay of caloric intake until the evening and night hours. Birketvedt revealed that night eaters consume 56% of their daily caloric intake between the hours of 8 p.m. and 6 a.m., compared with 15% by control subjects (5). The foods consumed during episodes of evening hyperphagia and night eating tend to be carbohydrate-rich (7), with a high carbohydrate to protein ratio of 7:1. Nighttime awakenings are common among night eaters, and >50% of these episodes were associated with food intake, compared with 0% in control subjects (5). CASE PRESENTATION A 19-yr-old college softball player was referred to a sports medicine clinic by her team's strength staff and teammates for not eating during the daytime and a concern for possible anorexia nervosa. For most of the day, she reported a lack of appetite until approximately 3 p.m., when she ate her first meal. A teammate reported her to be seen pushing her food around the plate and not eating. She attempted to restrict calories during meals because of a bloated feeling in the morning. She denied binging or purging activities. She was seen 3 months earlier by another physician for a complaint of insomnia. She denied difficulty with initiating sleep, but experienced frequent nighttime awakenings, on average three to four times in one night. She had one roommate, and she denied excessive noise, poorly regulated temperature, or light disturbances. She did not discuss her nighttime eating with that physician. She also denied nightmares or night terrors. She had attempted over-the-counter sleep aids without improvement in her symptoms. She was started on zolpidem tartrate, which did not diminish the number of awakenings. Upon each awakening she would consume a snack, consisting of carbohydrate-rich foods, such as cookies or crackers, frequently more than 1000 calories over the night. Although she tried to refrain from eating, she felt unsatisfied and unable to reinitiate sleep until consuming food. Generally, she reported being conscious while eating. However, at times she only would become aware of the episodes by the food wrappers surrounding her bed the next morning. After eating she easily returned to sleep, but reawakened 1-2 h later. Her roommate reported having her personal food confiscated by the patient at night and engaging in conversations that the patient could not recall the following day. The following morning after an episode, she experienced a moderate amount of guilt related to her eating and modest weight gain of approximately 7 lb. She admitted to a mildly depressed mood and intermittent anhedonia. She reported anxiety related to increased life stressors over the past few months associated with softball, classes, and a new relationship. She denied having difficulty concentrating or a decline in academic work. However, she noticed decreased endurance and performance during softball practice and competitions, especially with morning activities during which she felt tired, bloated, and groggy. By not eating for most of the day, she often lacked enough energy to complete an entire afternoon practice. She denied suicidal or homicidal ideation. At the time of the visit about eating disorder concern, she was no longer taking any medication or supplements. She denied a personal or family history of eating disorders. A complete review of systems was otherwise negative. Upon examination, vital signs were normal; height was 5'6,\" and weight was 160 lb. The physical and psychiatric exams were unremarkable. Her Zung depression scale score was 24, and her night eating questionnaire score was 49. EPIDEMIOLOGY Although NES was described initially in the obesity literature, it is not limited to this demographic. The syndrome's prevalence among the general population is estimated at 1.5% (19). Up to 8.9% of obesity clinic patients meet the criteria for NES (16). However, the diagnostic patterns do not appear to be different for obese and non-obese individuals with NES (7). A recent study investigating familial aggregation showed that individuals with NES were more likely to have an affected first-degree relative than control subjects (OR = 4.9) (13). Recently, the link between psychiatric illness and NES has become of interest because of its association with stress and depression. Lundgren et al. found that 12.3% of patients in an outpatient psychiatric clinic met the diagnostic criteria for NES and that these patients had a higher rate of substance abuse and atypical antipsychotic use than patients without NES (12). DIAGNOSIS As NES is not included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder (DSM-IV), variance in diagnostic criteria is widely seen in both past and present studies. In a recent evaluation of diagnostic criteria, Allison et al. report that the definition of night eating has ranged from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m. to the more general \"after the evening meal,\" while the proportion of total calories consumed has varied from 25% to 50% (2). These inconsistencies create some difficulty in generalizing investigational results to the general population, as well as clearly identifying whether a patient meets criteria for the actual syndrome or is a variant of normal. In reality, many people have episodes of late-night eating, and in households that often spend evenings watching television, after-dinner snacking may be the norm. In addition, there is variation in the average dinnertime among cultures, with the average person in the United States eating between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m., while the average person in Europe has dinner between 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. The question of whether to include NES in the DSM-V has prompted further investigation into the diagnostic tools and criteria currently used. In an attempt to assess two screening instruments, Vander Wal et al. found that use of a single simple screening question had adequate sensitivity but poor specificity to identify patients correctly with NES (24). Additionally, while the NEQ was correlated positively with increasing diagnostic detail, there was an inability to achieve both high sensitivity and specificity with varying cut points. Vander Wal concluded that the difference between eating late at night versus waking from sleep to eat might be the key to distinguishing NES as a true pathologic state. By evaluating several items from the Night Eating Questionnaire (NEQ), Allison et al. found that three items appear to be core aspects of the disorder: 1) evening hyperphagia and/or nocturnal eating, 2) initial insomnia, and 3) awakenings from sleep (4). Their analysis suggests that the presence of morning anorexia and a delayed morning meal added little additional information. The NEQ has evolved alongside research to characterize NES. Developed as a standardized screening tool for diagnosing NES, the current version is a 14-item questionnaire that addresses both behavioral and psychological aspects of the syndrome. The questions investigate the following aspects of NES: morning hunger and timing of first food consumption, cravings, control over eating before bedtime and during nighttime awakenings, percentage of post-dinner food consumption, initial insomnia, frequency of awakenings, associated food consumption during awakenings and awareness during these episodes, and mood disturbance (4). By varying the cut score, Allison et al. calculated that a positive predictive value of up to 77% can be attained (2). While the NEQ has been shown to be an efficient and valid measure of the severity of NES, its primary use is as a screening tool and it should not replace clinical interview for diagnosis. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY In general, it has been recognized that the pattern of intake rather than the total calories ingested is different in NES subjects compared with controls (17). NES has been linked to changes in the circadian rhythm and disturbances in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis (HPA). Therefore, NES has been described as delayed circadian eating patterns superimposed upon normal sleep-wake cycles (17). An inpatient study by Allison et al. showed a decrease in overnight ghrelin levels, a stomach-derived appetite stimulant, compared with control subjects, whereas insulin and glucose increased at night (1). No difference was found in secretion of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), melatonin, leptin, cortisol, or prolactin. In comparison, Birketvedt et al. found attenuated secretions of nocturnal leptin (an adipocyte-derived appetite suppressant) and melatonin, whereas cortisol was increased (5). In a small study comparing the response to corticotropin-releasing hormone among people with NES and control subjects, an attenuated response of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol release was observed, suggesting an overexpressed HPA (10). The authors interpret this finding to be a result of the constant stressful stimuli to which people with NES are exposed, but they note that, alternately, it may be a direct result of a fasting state. They hypothesize that the behaviors of disordered sleep and increased nighttime appetite may be related directly to the neurotransmitter alterations that are caused by an increase in corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) stimulation. Based upon the observed caloric intake and neuroendocrine assays in a study of 15 women with NES and 14 control subjects, Goel et al. theorized that NES might represent dissociation between a central timing mechanism in the suprachiasmatic nucleus and other presumed regulator systems in the central nervous system, stomach, or liver (9). Again, the question of causality arises in interpreting whether the observed differences in ghrelin, leptin, melatonin, insulin, and glucose amplitudes and timing are altered independently compared with control subjects or are results of the abnormal behaviors of nocturnal waking and eating. TREATMENT Researchers have explored several pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapeutic options for NES, including serotonin reuptake inhibitors, topiramate, cognitive behavioral therapy, relaxation training, and light therapy. Lundgren et al. demonstrated elevated binding of midbrain serotonin transporters, which may amplify the reuptake of serotonin and impair postsynaptic serotonin transmission (14). This theory can explain why selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) are useful in treating individuals with NES. Early studies and case reports related reduction in night eating episodes and decrease in overall caloric intake to both short-term (2 wk) (15) and long-term (6-15 months) (20) SSRI use. In an 8-wk randomized, placebo-controlled study of sertraline for NES, 12/17 in the sertraline group responded to therapy compared with 3/17 in the control group (16). Seven of the 12 responders in the sertraline group had a remission or complete resolution of symptoms, compared with one of the three responders in the control group. This study was different than previous SSRI trials because it included a small number of normal weight subjects. Of these, two of the three in the sertraline group responded, compared with zero of three in the control group. Participants in the study group had a 30% chance of responding at 2 wk and a 50% chance of responding between weeks 4 and 8. Overall, the sertraline group had a significant reduction in the symptoms of NES, including a reduction in nocturnal ingestions (80%), lower caloric intake after the evening meal (32.5%), and weight loss (approximately 1 lb·wk−1). The changes in night eating did not correlate with changes in depressive symptoms, which were modest at baseline. Because individuals with NES report greater levels of depression and anxiety in addition to displaying evidence of elevated stress (increased cortisol and CRH), Pawlow et al. designed a study to evaluate effects of relaxation training (18). The study focused upon the short-term effects on a group (N = 10) randomized to abbreviated progressive muscle relaxation technique (APRT) compared with control subjects (N = 10). Participants in the APRT group reported lower levels of anxiety and stress and higher levels of relaxation immediately after a session, which correlated to lower levels of salivary cortisol. After 7 d of home practice, the significant decrease in levels of anxiety and stress persisted in the APRT group compared with control subjects. The relaxation group also had a significant increase in morning appetite and decrease in evening appetite rating, but had a nonsignificant decrease in days with post-bedtime eating. Bright-light therapy has been suggested as a therapy for weight loss in obese subjects (6). A case report of an obese woman with NES demonstrated resolution of night eating symptoms when exposed to light therapy, in addition to decreased depression scores (8). NES symptoms recurred when light therapy was discontinued. Light therapy's ability to alter the circadian pattern changes seen in NES may explain this therapeutic observation. DISCUSSION We used the following provisional criteria outlined by Birketvedt (1999) (5) to diagnose our athlete with NES: 1) morning anorexia, even if breakfast is eaten; 2) evening hyperphagia, in which >50% of daily energy intake is consumed after the evening meal; 3) awakenings at least once per night; 4) consumption of snacks during awakenings; 5) repetition of provisional criteria longer than 3 months; and 6) does not meet the criteria for bulimia nervosa or binge eating disorder. To our knowledge, there have been no studies or case reports focusing upon NES in the athletic population. However, there is a well-accepted association between sports participation and eating disorders. While determining the true prevalence in athletes has been difficult, one Norwegian study estimated that 13.5% of elite athletes have eating disorders, defined as anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and eating disorder not otherwise specified, compared with 4.6% in the control population (22). Our patient was diagnosed before the Allison et al. (2009) proposed diagnostic criteria for night eating syndrome (3). Our patient fulfilled these criteria as well as the older Birketvedt criteria. With regard to NES, there are specific issues to consider in the athletic population. First, although morning anorexia may exist, athletes may force themselves to eat breakfast to meet the energy demands of early morning practice or competition. Similarly, athletes may appear to have a normal percentage of preevening meal calories, but their calorie requirements may far exceed their intake. As in our athlete, symptoms of underperformance as a result of a negative energy balance and inadequate sleep may be the driving factor to seek medical attention. Finally, although some athletes may notice weight gain, overall they are less likely to be clinically overweight or obese given the intense training required to perform at a high level. Our athlete's initial complaint was of insomnia, and she was instructed initially in basic sleep-hygiene practices. Her nighttime eating was not mentioned on the first visit, and the prescription of a sleep aid may have exacerbated her problem. Once NES was diagnosed, she was started on sertraline (50 mg daily). She was titrated gradually up to a dose of 200 mg daily over the next 6 wk. She was simultaneously sent to the college mental health center for cognitive-behavioral therapy. She went for four visits and reported a significant reduction in symptoms with the treatments. Although she awoke on average once per night, down from the previous three to four times each night, she was usually able to return to sleep almost immediately without eating. She developed regular eating patterns, consuming three regular meals per day with one to two snacks. Her mood improved and anhedonia also resolved. She continued softball participation throughout her treatment, with noticeable improvements and increased consistency in performance once her night eating resolved.",

Anabolic-androgenic steroids, synthetic progestins, and antiepileptics are the most frequently implicated drugs in hyperandrogenism. The mechanisms of androgen excess are various: (1) intrinsic androgenic activity of the drug, (2) interaction with sex hormone-binding globulin, or (3) functional alterations of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovary axis. Nevertheless, the physiology of these drugs remains generally unclear. Such is the case for valproate, which seems to induce a form of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) by increasing ovarian androgen synthesis. It should be remembered that it is always necessary to rule out other causes of androgen excess, especially an ovarian or adrenal tumor or PCOS, before attributing the symptom(s) to a drug.",

      "abstract": "Chronic diseases often require long-lasting pharmacotherapy. Administration of some medicines on a daily routine may cause troublesome adverse effects thus discouraging the patient from further treatment. An abrupt withdrawal of formerly continuous pharmacotherapy not proceeded by the professional medical consultation may endanger the patient either due to the relapse of the disease or the onset of withdrawal symptoms that, despite some opinions, are not limited only to potentially addictive medications. These symptoms may be mistaken for a clinical manifestation of a yet another medical condition of the ill leading to a vicious cycle of repeated diagnostics – additional pharmacotherapy – discontinuation of treatment due to drug intolerance – novel symptoms – repeated diagnostics etc., especially in the elderly. Unfortunately, even some medical doctors tend to forget that administration of specific drugs should not be stopped suddenly because certain withdrawal symptoms are more harmful than mild drug-induced adverse reactions. On the other hand, this is the clinician’s individual decision whether to stop or to continue the treatment in the presence of drug intolerance reported by the patient as many “practical” guidelines either do not give any recommendations or the statements are too general to be helpful in every-day practice. Therefore, the authors review the data on the causative factors and clinical implications of a sudden drug withdrawal, including mainly stricte non-addictive medicines in use for diseases of high incidence in general population.",

      "abstract": "Anxiety in children undergoing surgery is characterized by subjective feelings of tension, apprehension, nervousness, and worry that may be expressed in various forms (1). Postoperative maladaptive behaviors, such as new onset enuresis, feeding difficulties, apathy and withdrawal, and sleep disturbances, may also result from anxiety before surgery. In fact, studies have indicated that up to 60% of all children undergoing surgery may present with negative behavioral changes at 2 wk postoperatively (1,2). Variables such as age, temperament, and anxiety of the child and parent in the preoperative holding area have been identified as predictors for these behavioral changes (1). Extreme anxiety during induction of anesthesia is also associated with an increase of these postoperative negative behavioral changes (3). In addition to behavioral manifestations, preoperative anxiety activates the human stress response, leading to increased serum cortisol, epinephrine, and natural killer cell activity (4,5). This stress response can be activated by many different noxious stimuli including fear, anxiety, pain, cold, major surgery, and infection. The main components of the stress system are the corticotropin-releasing hormone and the locus ceruleus-norepinephrine/autonomic systems and their peripheral effectors, the hypothalamic pituitary-adrenal axis and the limbs of the autonomic system (5). There is also evidence for a bidirectional communication between the neuroendocrine system and the immune system. Stress activates the hypothalamic pituitary-adrenal axis, increases circulating glucocorticoids, and is associated with alterations of immune function and susceptibility to infection and neoplastic disease (6). The human response to surgical stress is characterized by a series of hormonal, immunological, and metabolic changes that together constitute the global surgical stress response (7,8). This perioperative response is considered a homeostatic mechanism for adapting to the perioperative injury. The effects of the surgical stress response, however, may be detrimental: neuroendocrine hormones (e.g., cortisol, catecholamines) and cytokines (e.g., interleukin-6) provoke a negative nitrogen balance and catabolism, delay wound healing, and cause postoperative immunosuppression (7,8). Children are particularly vulnerable to the global surgical stress response because of limited energy reserves, larger brain masses, and obligatory glucose requirements (9). Because acute psychological stress, such as preoperative anxiety, is associated with immediate stress hormone release, the contribution of perioperative psychological factors to the global perioperative stress response cannot be ignored. In adults, increased preoperative anxiety is associated with poor postoperative behavioral and clinical recovery (10,11). As an indicator of the importance of preoperative anxiety, a panel of 72 anesthesiologists recently ranked various anesthesia low-morbidity clinical outcomes based on importance and frequency. The five clinical outcomes with the highest combined score were incisional pain, nausea, vomiting, preoperative anxiety, and discomfort from IV insertion (12). Thus, consensus is evident among anesthesiologists about the need to treat anxiety before surgery. In a modern epidemiological framework, diseases can be characterized in terms of risk factors, interventions, and outcomes. In this update, we will review preoperative anxiety in children using this conceptual framework (Fig. 1).Figure 1: Conceptual framework of perioperative anxiety. Revised from (72).The Psychobiology of Separation Learning to cope with separation from a parent is necessary for a child's normal development (13). Separation experiences such as going to school facilitate normal psychological development and personality organization. Other separation experiences, such as perioperative separation, may precipitate confusion and anxiety. Between these two extremes, there are many separation experiences with varying degrees of psychobiological stress. In the first weeks of life, infants are able to discriminate among people, but will accept care and comfort from adults other than their parents (14). By 3 mo of age, however, infants begin to respond differently to familiar and unfamiliar people. Older infants smile more at familiar people and may even try to engage their attention (14). Separation anxiety usually begins at 7–8 mo of age and peaks around 1 yr of age. In part, separation anxiety represents the infant's acquisition of new cognitive abilities and object permanence. The intensity of separation anxiety declines with age, largely because of increasing cognitive abilities and memory capacity. Frequently, however, the increase in abilities does not immunize toddlers and preschoolers against the stress and distress of separations. The extent to which separation is traumatic or evokes adaptive responses reflects an individual child's developmental age, parenting experiences, genetic endowment, and environmental stability. For children with biologically based vulnerabilities, such as a sensitivity to novelty and transitions, even expected separations may impose a greater degree of stress than for less sensitive children (13). How parents help the child mediate a separation experience play a crucial role in the child's acute and long-term responses. In the extreme, the parent may be unable to mediate the experience for the child because of limitations such as severe anxiety. How well children have been cared for up to the time of the separation also influences their response to the stressor. Children deprived of attention in the home are at increased risk for stress in response to separations. Thus, the extent to which separations evoke adaptive responses reflects an individual child's genetics, personality, parenting, and previous life experiences. Preoperative Anxiety: Identification Identifying risk factors for development of preoperative anxiety is important, as more resources can be directed toward vulnerable children. Children 1–5 yr old are at the highest risk for developing extreme anxiety (1). This is not surprising considering the psychobiology of separation anxiety. Children who are shy or inhibited and those who have a high intelligence quotient and lack good adaptive abilities are also at increased risk (15). Previous surgery or hospitalization and poor response to visits to the pediatrician's office are also predictors for the development of preoperative anxiety. Finally, parental anxiety has been identified as a predictor for increased child's anxiety. Preoperative Anxiety: Behavioral Modalities Preoperative Preparation Programs Most studies suggest that preoperative preparation programs reduce anxiety and enhance coping in children (16). These behavioral preparation programs have evolved significantly over recent decades. In the 1960s, preparation programs were designed to provide an orientation tour and narrative information and facilitate trust between the hospital staff, the child, and the parent (16). In the 1970s, modeling techniques were developed where children indirectly experienced the perioperative course by role rehearsal using dolls or by viewing a video (17). These modeling techniques were augmented in the late 1980s with child life preparation and the teaching of coping skills (17). Currently, development of coping skills is considered the most effective preoperative preparation intervention, followed by modeling, play therapy, operating room tour, and printed material (18). Although experts favor teaching of coping skills, most preparation programs in the United States consist of an orientation tour and printed information (18). Although coping preparation has been associated with reduction of anxiety in the preoperative holding area, no differences were found among the various preparation programs during induction, in the recovery room period, or postoperatively (19). Thus, the cost-effectiveness of child life specialists may or may not be justified by an associated reduction in preoperative anxiety. Psychological preparation programs should be tailored to individual needs such as age, developmental stage, and previous experience (20). The priority of the age criterion relates to both the anxiety such exposure might generate and the length of time over which children can cope with anticipation. In addition, timing of the program before surgery is an important variable (20). Children aged ≥6 yr benefit most if they participate in a preparation program ≥5 days before surgery and benefit least if the program is given only 1 day before surgery. This phenomenon is related to the way that children in this age group process new information. Finally, a child who has previously undergone surgery or has been hospitalized may develop an exaggerated emotional response to an information-based preparation program (20). As increased parental anxiety results in increased child's anxiety (1), there is a need for interventions that are designed specifically for parents. Cassady et al. (21) demonstrated that parental preoperative anxiety decreased after viewing an educational videotape. We suggest that more parental interventions need to be developed and that a child's anxiety should be evaluated as an outcome. Preoperative Anxiety: Behavioral Modalities Parental Presence during Induction of Anesthesia. Parents and children prefer to stay together during medical procedures such as immunizations, dental treatment, and induction of anesthesia (22). Some data indicate, however, that parental presence during induction of anesthesia (PPIA) is allowed in 26% of US hospitals and is encouraged in only 8% of hospitals (23). In contrast, 28% of hospitals have no formal hospital policy and parental presence is against hospital policy for 32% of hospitals in the US. The smallest use of this induction technique was reported in the South-Central region and the highest in the Northwest and the Northeast (23). Interestingly, anesthesiologists from Great Britain (GB) encourage PPIA significantly more than anesthesiologists from the US (23,24). The reasons for these differences may include the use of different induction techniques, less concern about legal ramifications in GB, and a stronger demand for parental presence in GB. Economic issues such as operating room (OR) efficiency, infrastructure issues, lack of induction rooms and patchy preoperative educational programs, probably limit the availability of PPIA in the US. Potential benefits from PPIA include reducing the need for preoperative sedatives and avoiding the fear and anxiety that may occur on separation to the OR. Other benefits, such as increasing the child's compliance during induction, remain controversial. Objections to PPIA include concern about disruption of the OR routine, crowded ORs, and a possible adverse reaction of parents. In addition, increased parental anxiety can increase a child's anxiety, prolong anesthetic induction, and place additional stress on the anesthesiologist. Although early observational studies suggested reduced anxiety if parents were present during induction (25), more recent randomized controlled trials indicate that routine parental presence is not beneficial (26–28). One study demonstrated that only children >4 yr of age, those who have a \"calm\" baseline personality, or those who have a parent with a \"calm\" baseline personality benefit from this intervention (26). When interpreting the results of these studies, however, it should be noted that the design of a randomized controlled study does not reflect the practice of all anesthesiologists. When data of survey studies are reviewed (23,24), it is noticed that most anesthesiologists use either PPIA or sedative premedication to treat preoperative anxiety. When sedative premedications were directly compared with PPIA, however, it was found that children receiving oral midazolam were significantly less anxious and more compliant during the induction process (27). A recent study examined whether a combination of PPIA and oral midazolam is more effective than oral midazolam alone (28). The investigators found that PPIA has no additive anxiolytic effects for children who received oral midazolam preoperatively. Parents who accompany their sedated children into the ORs, however, are significantly less anxious and more satisfied both with the separation process and with the overall anesthetic, nursing and surgical care provided (28). PPIA is also associated with important legal implications. Lewyn (29) described a case in which a mother was invited to accompany her son into an emergency treatment room. According to the court, the mother fainted and suffered an injury to the head. In its verdict the Illinois Supreme Court stated that a hospital, which allows a nonpatient to accompany a patient during treatment, does not have a duty to protect the nonpatient from fainting. However, if medical personnel invite the nonpatient to participate in the treatment, then the hospital has a legal responsibility toward the nonpatient. Interestingly, some hospitals in the US now require the parents to sign a written informed consent acknowledging the risk of being present during induction of anesthesia. We believe that future research interests should shift towards an emphasis on what parents actually do during induction of anesthesia, rather than simply on their presence. Allowing a parent into an OR without significant preparation may be counterproductive because some parent behaviors, such as criticism and commands, are associated with increased distress. Effective methods of training such as parental preparation programs can be developed for enhancing the effects of PPIA. Preoperative Anxiety: Pharmacological Modalities The reported rate of use of pharmacological modalities for the treatment of preoperative anxiety in the US varies widely among age groups and geographical locations (24). Premedicant sedative drugs are least often used with children <3 yr of age and most often used with adults <65 yr of age (25% vs 75%). Currently, the most commonly used sedative premedicant in the preoperative holding area is midazolam (85%), followed by ketamine (4%), transmucosal fentanyl (3%), and meperidine (2%) (Fig. 2). TABLETABLE The majority of children in the US are premedicated via the oral route (80%), followed by the intranasal route (8%), the IM route (6%), and the rectal route (3%).Figure 2: Types of premedicants used in the preoperative holding area (23).Table 1: Premedications Administered by the Oral RouteTable 2: Premedications Administered Transmucosally and RectallyMidazolam. Midazolam is a short-acting benzodiazepine that is very lipophilic at physiologic pH, which accounts for its rapid onset of action. Davis et al. (30) has demonstrated that intranasally administered midazolam in a dosage of 0.2–0.3 mg/kg in patients undergoing myringotomies led to satisfactory separation from parents and a satisfactory induction over 70% of the time and did not prolong recovery time and hospital discharge time. Midazolam administered intranasally is effective in reducing anxiety in children within 10–12 min (31). A major drawback of intranasally administered midazolam, however, is that at least 50% of children cry on administration because it transiently irritates the nasal passages. Midazolam can also be given as a nasal spray, which is effective in reducing procedural anxiety in children undergoing cancer therapy (32). Midazolam can be administrated sublingually at the same dosage as intranasally. Although sublingual administration of midazolam is associated with a decreased incidence of crying (18%), it may be difficult to prevent small children from either swallowing the midazolam or spitting it out immediately (33). Rectal administration of midazolam in doses of 0.5–1.0 mg/kg effectively reduces the anxiety of children before induction of anesthesia (34). Although the incidence of hiccups after IV midazolam is <2%, the incidence noted that in a recent study involving rectally administered midazolam was more than 20%(34). The investigators had no explanation as to the increased rate of hiccups other than the young age of the children, but they found that the hiccups were easily treated by ethyl chloride nasal spray (34). Orally administered midazolam (0.5 mg/kg) has been shown to significantly reduce preoperative anxiety in young children (27,28). Orally administered midazolam can be given in a dosage of 0.25 mg to 1.0 mg/kg up to total dose of 20 mg depending on the duration of surgery and the anxiety level of the child. A commercially available and Food and Drug Administration-approved midazolam in a syrup form of 2 mg/mL became available in 1998. Suresh et al. (35) examined different doses of the commercially available midazolam and found that 0.25 mg/kg resulted in satisfactory sedation and anxiolysis in a majority of patients within 20 min. This study also found that increasing the dose resulted in an increase in the proportion of patients with satisfactory sedation and a shortened time to onset of action (35). Other authors report that the minimum time interval for successfully separating premedicated children from their parents is 10 min with a peak sedative effect occurring between 20 and 30 min (36). The issue of orally administered midazolam and delays in the discharge of patients is controversial. Although several recent studies noted that orally administrated midazolam is not associated with a delayed discharge (28,29,37), two studies involving children undergoing adenoidectomy report that emergence and recovery are delayed in the children who receive oral midazolam preoperatively (38,39). Another study involving children who underwent myringotomies using sevoflurane or halothane anesthesia indicated that children who were given oral midazolam experienced significant delays in recovery time but no delays in discharge time from the hospital (40). Finally, Martlew et al. (41) have addressed the issue of a combination of preoperative oral midazolam and propofol-based anesthetic. The investigators found that propofol infusion requirements decrease by one-third and discharge readiness was delayed in children who had been given midazolam preoperatively. The investigators suggested that the increased postoperative sedation may have been attributable to synergism of propofol and midazolam on GABA receptors (42). As indicated above, a significant proportion of children experiences maladaptive behavioral changes after outpatient surgery (1). In one investigation, children who were premedicated with oral midazolam had a significantly decreased incidence of negative behavioral changes during the first week after surgery (43). However, this study noted that by 2 wk postoperatively there were no significant differences between the midazolam and placebo groups. The mechanism by which midazolam decreases the incidence of postoperative behavioral changes is not clear but it may be related to amnesia of the perioperative process (44). Children who received a benzodiazepine for dental extractions and were amnestic about the experience tolerated further dental treatments better than children who were not amnestic about their initial dental extractions (45). This finding may be particularly important for children undergoing repeated surgical procedures. Memory becomes impaired in children after oral midazolam as early as 10 min and anxiolytic effects are apparent as early as 15 min after administration (44). This short timing to onset of amnesia is of particular importance in busy surgery centers where the turnover of cases is very quick. Midazolam and diazepam can be reversed with flumazenil, which antagonizes benzodiazepines competitively. The initial recommended dose in children is 0.05 mg/kg given IV in a titrated fashion of up to 1.0 mg total. Some children who are reversed with flumazenil will experience resedation, so it is prudent to monitor them for 1–2 h (46). Adequate drug levels can also be reached intranasally in a dose of 40 μg/kg given by drops from a syringe (47). Fentanyl. Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that is very lipophilic, which makes the drug a good candidate for administration across mucosal and dermal barriers. Oral transmucosal fentanyl citrate (OTFC) administered in the form of a lozenge attached to a stick and known as the OTFC was the first sedative drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1993 for use in children. Oral transmucosal citrate in 200-, 300-, and 400-μg dosage units is mixed in a raspberry-flavored candy matrix and given to children in the dosage of 10–15 μg/kg for absorption transmucosally. Its sedative effect is often associated with facial pruritus, which usually occurs 30–45 min after children begin to consume the lozenge. OTFC sedates children before induction of anesthesia (48–51). OTFC does not, however, reliably lead to decreased apprehension or improved cooperation with induction in young children (48–51). In a small percentage of patients, OTFC can cause a respiratory depression leading to clinically significant oxygen desaturation, so a clinician skilled in airway management must be present while this drug is administered (48). OTFC usage in children is associated with a frequent incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting that is not easily antagonized by prophylactic droperidol (49). In fact, at least one study was prematurely terminated because of a very frequent incidence of preoperative vomiting (48). A significant advantage of OTFC is that it decreases the postoperative narcotic requirement (50). Dsida et al. (50) reported that preoperative OTFC is as effective as IV fentanyl (2 μg/kg) given intraoperatively for management of postoperative analgesia in children undergoing tonsillectomy. Ketamine. Ketamine is an arylcycloalkylamine that produces a state of sedation, immobility, analgesia, amnesia, and dissociation from the environment. An advantage of ketamine compared with other premedicants is that it causes less respiratory depression when given in equipotent sedative doses (52). A disadvantage of ketamine as compared with other premedicants is the association of increased salivary and bronchial secretions, which can lead to laryngospasm (53). Ketamine can also cause muscle rigidity and nystagmus in children, which can alarm parents if they are not informed about this characteristic. An increased incidence of postoperative emesis is associated with preoperative administration of ketamine (54, 55). The above side effects are all dose related and can be diminished with the use of a small dose of orally administered ketamine (3 mg/kg) (54). Unfortunately, the time of onset of the action of orally administered ketamine is also dose related with large-dose orally administered ketamine (6 mg/kg) having an onset of action of 10 min and small-dose ketamine leading to sedation within 20 min (54,55). Ketamine administration may be associated with agitation and hallucinations during the postoperative period (55,56). Two recent studies have found that concurrent use of a benzodiazepine given to children undergoing ketamine sedation did not affect the incidence of postprocedure agitation (55,56). In addition, the incidence of postoperative nightmares, restless sleep, and nocturia is no different in children receiving ketamine, midazolam, or a combination of ketamine and midazolam together (55). The IV preparation of ketamine can be mixed with cola or fruit syrup to create an oral mixture of ketamine, which is favorably accepted by most children. Ketamine can be also be given intranasally (3–5 mg/kg), transmucosally (5–6 mg/kg), rectally (5 mg/kg), and IM (2–5 mg/kg) (57,58). Postanesthesia care unit discharge time of children who received orally administered ketamine is reported not to be prolonged compared with orally administered midazolam provided that duration of surgery is longer than 30 min (55). Ketamine administered IM in an emergency room setting, however, was found to significantly delay discharge and increase costs compared with midazolam administered rectally or intranasally (59). Funk et al. (55) reported that the combination of midazolam and ketamine administrated orally had a 90% success rate of satisfactory anxiolysis compared with <75% with either drug alone. An oral ketamine/midazolam mixture was also found to be superior to IM meperidine, promethazine, and chlorpromazine in children undergoing pediatric cardiac catheterization (60). The ketamine/midazolam mixture provided superior sedation and amnesia and there was less need for IV propofol rescue as compared with the IM regimen (60). Clonidine. Clonidine is an α2 adrenergic agonist first developed as an antihypertensive agent but later found to have analgesic, anxiolytic, and sedative properties (61). Orally administrated clonidine in a dose of 4 μg/kg reliably causes sedation, decreases anesthetic requirements, and decreases requirement for postoperative analgesics (61–63). End-tidal halothane requirements decrease by almost 50% in children premedicated preoperatively with clonidine (62). This decrease in minimum alveolar concentration requirement may be secondary to the analgesic effect of clonidine as well as a primary hemodynamic effect (62). Preoperatively administered clonidine is also as effective as intraoperatively administered fentanyl (3 μg/kg) for postoperative analgesia in children undergoing tonsillectomies (64). The recovery profile of children who receive clonidine is similar to the recovery profile of children who receive oral diazepam (0.2 mg/kg), but clonidine causes significantly less postoperative psychomotor impairments as compared with diazepam (65,66). One major drawback for the use of clonidine as a sedative premedicant is its slow onset of action. Clonidine has to be administered orally as early as 45 min before surgery (61). In children, peak plasma concentration is at 60–90 min for orally administered clonidine and 50 min for rectally administered clonidine (61). New Directions for the Future Future research efforts should concentrate on the development of sedatives that will be well tolerated, have a very short time for onset of anxiolysis, and have short duration of action. In addition, newly developed preoperative sedatives should possess properties such as antegrade amnesia and should ideally decrease intraoperative anesthetic requirements and reduce postoperative analgesic requirements. Finally, new methods of delivering sedative premedications should also be developed. For example, transdermal applications of medications should be investigated as well as oral transmucosal delivery methods for medications other than fentanyl. Simple transdermal medications usually take at least 1 h for minimally effective serum concentrations of drugs to be reached unless iontophoresis is used. Iontophoresis can significantly speed the transfer of medication across a dermal surface and has been effective in delivering fentanyl in adults within 10 min at 2 mA (67). Finally, the effectiveness of alternative treatment modalities such as acupuncture should be investigated (68). Further research is needed in these areas. The authors would like to thank Paul G.

      "abstract": "During the last twenty-five years it has come to be recognized that a fairly large amount of mental deficiency appears to coincide with or result from faulty intracranial myelination. In some such children little or no post-natal development occurs, in others recession is already occurring at birth; a few remain fairly normal for some years. Spastic contractures, especially of the legs, grow progressively worse, epilepsy may appear, the child goes steadily downhill and early death is the usual termination. In some cases choreoathetosis is present, and this may either, if the patient lives long enough, disappear spontaneously, or, more usually, become impossible when the spastic contractures have immobilized the extremities. Post-mortem one finds one of two conditions—demyelination of the brain (the status dysmyelinatus of Hallervorden-Spatz) or hypermyelination (the status marmoratus of the Vogts). In both forms there is much hypergliosis, evidently secondary to some irritating but slow myelin poison which finally produces anoxia. Clinically during life both varieties appear much the same, and that is all that is known about its nature at present. Cases were recorded by the Vogts in 1920, Hallervorden and Spatz in 1922, Kalinowski in 1927, Helfand in 1931, Spatz and Peters in 1938; in this country by Meyer and Cook in 1936, Meyer and Earl in 1936. By these authors the views of others are summarized—Bielschowski, Loewenberg and Malamud, Urechia and Michalescu, Bouché and Van Bogaert, Casper, Ammosow, Bostroem, Bodechtel and Guttmann. If epilepsy has been present, it generally disappears after some years. By no means all cases end up as helpless idiots; some learn to attend to their own wants, but few ever walk freely.",

The optimum degree of relaxation necessary to this technique is unknown. 2) Hypnosis and suggestibility play a nebulous role, influencing speed of progress, relaxation and imagery. 3) The ability to evoke anxiety to imagined stimuli is essential to in vitro desensitization. 4) Interview-induced emotional responses, although demonstrated to have a significant affect upon desensitization, are not essential. 5) Interpretation, confrontation and insight are not significant aspects of psychotherapy by reciprocal inhibition. 6) Patients with a history of a conditioning process, a specific stimulus antecendent for anxiety and minimal free-floating anxiety, benefit most from desensitization. 7) The positive influence an understanding of the reciprocal inhibition theory has on patients' motivation, attitude and expectancy may be related to primary suggestibility.",

In the present work we have made a brief bibliographical revision on the aspects in that the cocaine affects neurologically. Besides the toxic and structural damages for the cocaine and their metabolites, we would have present the action on the cardiovascular system and the possible accidents that they can be suffered. Among those aspects we must present and mention: the cerebrovascular accidents (haemorrhage, coronaries) due the vasoconstrictive action and the activator effects of cocaine on heart. Other damages and alterations are the due spastic crises for toxic and metabolic phenomena and for catecholamine increment. Repetition phenomena due the cocaine intoxication are the migraines caused by different problems from the haemorrhages and cerebral coronaries, arterial hypertension, etc. the crises of agitation (seizures) that can appear also in the course of the intoxication. They have been able to detect catatonic processes or dystonia attributable to the use of cocaine. The hyperthermia is another frequent phenomenon among the consumers of cocaine, mainly when wastes away in spaces that can produce increment of temperature. Also we can found neuropsycopharmacological damages like the serotoninergic syndrome. The demyelation effects have been described due the toxic effect and the rabdomiolisis on the white substance, as muscular damages for the hyperthermia, the sympathetic hyperestimulation, vasoconstrictive phenomena, etc.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Schizophrenia is a chronic and severe mental disorder that is characterized by a disintegration of the process of thinking, of emotional responsiveness, and of contact with reality. Early in the twentieth century, schizophrenia was known as dementia praecox (premature dementia), because of the disintegration or fragmenting of mental functions typically observed in people with the disorder. The term schizophrenia itself means “fragmented mind,” referring to the schisms between thought, emotion, and behavior that characterize the disease. It is not the same as “split personality,” which is an altogether different illness now known as dissociative identity disorder. People with schizophrenia do not alternate between “good” and “bad” personalities.",

Diagnostic criteria of neurologic FAS include (1) the accent is considered by the patient, acquaintances, and physician to sound foreign; (2) the accent is different from speech prior to cerebral insult; (3) it is related to CNS damage and is not psychogenic; and (4) the patient does not have a history indicating a reason for having an accent. Most individuals have accompanying left cerebral hemisphere lesions or have a pathologic disruption between cerebral and cerebellar speech centers. Individuals who experience cerebrovascular accidents are particularly susceptible to FAS. It has been reported that problems with articulation and comprehension can eventually lead to FAS. Psychogenic FAS is sometimes considered a subcategory of conversion disorder and has common comorbid psychiatric conditions including depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia and can present with additional conversion disorders. FAS can also present independent of other comorbid conditions.",

Contraindications include uncontrolled seizures, dangerous anxiety, active cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, active psychosis, drug abuse, irresponsible criminal behavior, dangerously underweight, and uncontrolled headaches. Recommend use is 6 days per week 51 weeks per year to reduce tolerance. Some patients find additional benefit from donepezil, rivastigmine, and regulated caffeine use. Approach options: “aggressive,” involving treatment with stimulants primarily based on history; “moderate,” involving treatment with stimulants only in patients with attention performance impairments documented with neuropsychological evaluation; and “conservative,” not including stimulants unless there is a well-documented history of preinjury attention deficit disorder.",

Nowadays, it is a wider spread opinion that 10% of the live born children belong to the group of those with neurodevelopment risks or that were under influence of other factors (medical history, clinical), which can lead to the early brain damage. Risk factors can be divided into perinatal, prenatal and postnatal ; and the worst effect of all have: premature birth - before the 32nd week of gestation ; low birth weight - less than 1500 grams ; machine breathing longer than 48 hours in the first 28 days of life ; cardio - respiratory collapse at birth including: Apgar score of 0– 3 in the fifth minute of life, inability to establish spontaneous respiration within the first 10 minutes and lasting muscle hypotonia during the first 2 hours of life ; prolonged perinatal hypoxemia ; acidemia ; neonatal hypoglycemia or recurrent apnea ; a history of epileptic seizures ; disturbances of consciousness of the newborn ; other potential neurological problems, such as previous CNS infection ; documented sepsis ; meningitis ; pathologic Hyperbilirubinemia, so called “Complicated” intracranial hemorrhage diagnosed by ultrasound (all except first degree) ; hypoxic - ischemic changes ; periventricular leucomalacia ; hydrocephalus and other congenital malformation ; and viral and other infection of the mother in the first weeks of pregnancy. With objective to prevent an easier neuromotor deviation and difficulties with basic life function to become dominant, stereotypical and habit of the child, physiotherapy intervention in the NICU is performed. It includes the proper positioning of the newborn, respiratory physiotherapy, early neurodevelopmental therapy, neonatal handling, preoral therapy and parent education.

      "title": "Parkinson's disease: drug-induced psychiatric states.",
      "abstract": "Drug-induced psychiatric states occur frequently in PD. In the prelevodopa era, depression and other psychiatric disorders were described in PD, but in untreated patients psychosis was rare. Since the development of levodopa and other pharmacological treatments for PD, however, psychotic symptoms have become much more common (10-50%). In some individuals these problems can be more disabling than the motor features of PD and, as a result, pose a serious threat to the patient's ability to maintain independence. The drug-induced psychoses consist of several distinct psychiatric syndromes that can be divided broadly into those occurring on a background of a clear sensorium and those which are accompanied by confusion and clouding of consciousness. Benign organic hallucinosis is the most common of these syndromes (30%). It usually occurs on a background of a clear sensorium and may not be a particularly troublesome problem if the patient is able to retain insight into the nature of these symptoms. More disabling syndromes usually include delusional thinking that is frequently paranoid, confusion and even frank delirium. Although all these psychotic syndromes can occur in isolation, there is a tendency for mild symptoms to progress to more disabling ones if adequate and timely treatment is not instituted. Abnormal dreaming and sleep disruption often precede these difficulties by weeks to months and may provide an important early clue to their onset. The mechanisms responsible for drug-induced psychotic symptoms in PD are unknown, but dopaminergic (especially mesolimbic) and serotoninergic systems are likely to be involved. The treatment of the drug-induced psychoses in PD should be undertaken in a stepwise manner. A detailed discussion of this approach, including the use of anti-PD medication adjustment, clozapine, and other medications (neuroleptic and nonneuroleptic) and ECT is provided (see Fig. 1). Although drug-induced psychoses are the most important of the drug-induced psychiatric states, mania, anxiety, and hypersexuality may also occur. Depression is also common in PD, but it is unlikely to occur as a side effect of antiparkinsonian medications.",

It is precipitated by medical illness, substance intoxication/withdrawal or medication effect. Delirium is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, and is a leading presenting symptom of illness in the elderly. Elderly patients with altered mental status, including agitation, should be presumed to have delirium until proven otherwise. The clinical manifestations of delirium are highly variable. A mental status evaluation is crucial in the diagnosis of delirium. Medical evaluation and stabilization should occur in parallel. Life-threatening etiologies including hypoxia, hypoglycemia and hypotension require immediate intervention. The differential diagnosis of etiologies of delirium is extensive. Patients with delirium need thorough evaluations to determine the underlying causes of the delirium. Pharmacological agents should be considered when agitated patient has the potential to harm themselves or others, or is impeding medical evaluation and management. Unfortunately, the evidence to guide pharmacologic management of acute agitation in the elderly is limited. Current pharmacologic options include the typical and atypical antipsychotic agents and the benzodiazepines. These therapeutic options are reviewed in detail.",

      "abstract": "The definition of dual tryptophan pathways has increased the understanding of the mind-body, body-mind dichotomy. The serotonergic pathway highlights the primary (endogenous) psychiatric disorders. The up-regulation of the kynurenine pathway by physical illnesses can cause neuropathic and immunological disorders1 associated with secondary neuropsychiatric symptoms. Tryptophan and nicotinamide deficiencies fall within the protein energy malnutrition (PEM) spectrum. They can arise if the kynurenine pathway is stressed by primary or secondary inflammatory conditions and the consequent imbalance of available catabolic/anabolic substrates may adversely influence convalescent phase efficiency. The replacement of depleted or reduced NAD+ levels and other cofactors can perhaps improve the clinical management of these disorders. Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and fibromyalgia (FM) appear to meet the criteria of a tryptophan-kynurenine pathway disorder with potential neuroimmunological sequelae. Aspects of some of the putative precipitating factors have been previously outlined.2,3 An analysis of the areas of metabolic dysfunction will focus on future directions for research and management.",

The damage is even more serious when the shaking ends with impact (shaken impact syndrome) (Duhaime et al. 1998). The battered baby may not exhibit any external signs of abuse, which often makes diagnosis difficult. This is especially likely if the method of child abuse has been shaking. The shaking induces a whiplash-type motion in which acceleration−deceleration forces can cause retinal and brain injury which are not apparent to the naked eye. Shaken baby syndrome is defined by swelling of the brain, subdural haematomas and retinal haemorrhages, but some infants also show external signs of injury to the head, ranging from subtle soft tissue damage to skull fractures (Hanigan et al. 1986; Gilliland & Folberg 1996). The major risk factors for child abuse include poverty, lack of education, being a single parent, and alcoholism or other drug abuse. Furthermore, premature children with developmental delay in association with prolonged crying are more prone to becoming objects of violence (Starling et al. 1995; Lazoritz et al. 1997; Lancon et al. 1998). Unfortunately, many children are abused repeatedly (Alexander et al. 1990). One third of identified patients die shortly after being abused acutely and SBS is the most common cause of death in child abuse cases (Kivlin et al. 2000). Many survivors develop significant neurological handicaps (Lancon et al. 1998). Hypoxia and ischaemia rather than impact may be major causes of brain injuries that involve subdural haemorrhages (Johnson et al. 1995; Blumenthal 2002). The most common ophthalmic finding in inflicted head injury is bilateral retinal haemorrhage, occurring in 50–100% of cases (Kivlin et al. 2000; Kivlin 2001). Retinal haemorrhages are believed to be consequences of venous obstruction in the retina caused by increased intracranial pressure following cerebral oedema and subdural haemorrhage (Kivlin et al. 2000; Kivlin 2001). In addition, traction of the vitreous on the retina during the attack may evoke circular retinal folds, lacunar haemorrhages and haemorrhagic retinoschisis cavities (Mills 1998). In November 2003, a 4-month-old boy was brought to the emergency unit with extensive vomiting, unconsciousness and brief cessation of breathing. Skin haemorrhagic lesions around the left eye, cheek and occipital area were observed. On the following day, an ophthalmologist observed haemorrhages in the left lid and the child showed a very weak and slow pupil response to light exposure. The conjunctiva, cornea, lens and vitreous body were healthy and showed normal morphology in both eyes. Extensive pre-, intra- and subretinal haemorrhages were seen bilaterally (Fig. 1A). Computed tomography (CT) examination revealed frontal subacute and chronic subdural effusions in both sides of the brain, but no bone fractures were found, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed extensive contusion-type trauma in the brain cortex in the occipital area demanding acute bilateral neurosurgical trepanation of the skull to relieve intracranial pressure. The retinal haemorrhages disappeared during the subsequent months and the appearance of the optic disc and retina were normal some months after the incident. Nonetheless, because of the serious brain damage, the boy developed severe mental retardation, epilepsy and blindness. This child was taken into care after the incident. (A) Fundus photograph in a 4-month-old boy with shaken baby syndrome (SBS), displaying pre-, intra- and subretinal haemorrhages with grave subdural effusion, which resulted in bilateral blindness. (B) Fundus photograph in a 6-month-old girl with SBS with pre-, intra- and subretinal haemorrhages with minor subdural effusion that resolved to result in normal visual acuity. In July 2006, a 6-month-old girl was examined in the emergency unit for unclear unconsciousness, vomiting and faintness. Two small skin haemorrhagic lesions in the forehead and mixed colour in the face were observed. On the following day, an ophthalmologist was asked to examine the infant’s eyes. Eyelid function was normal, as was the pupillary response to light. The cornea, lens and vitreous body were clear and showed normal morphology in both eyes. Large pre-, intra- and subretinal haemorrhages with central white spots were seen in both eyes, most prominently in the macular and peripapillar areas (Fig. 1B). However, CT and MRI pictures revealed only minimal subdural haemorrhage and otherwise normal brain morphology, and no bone fractures were found. During the 3 months of follow-up, all the retinal haemorrhages disappeared, pigmentation became normal, macular reflections were normalized and no retinal folds were seen. Furthermore, no posterior vitreous detachment could be observed. The child’s visual acuity and mental development appear to be normal and she still lives with her parents. Both our cases showed massive pre-, intra- and subretinal haemorrhages which spontaneously absorbed after some months. Thereafter the retinas and optic discs appeared to be normal. Despite the apparently similar appearance of the retinas in the acute phase of SBS, the boy remained blind, whereas the girl’s eyesight has completely recovered. However, immediately after the incidents there was a difference between the infants in pupil reactions to light and also in the extent of subdural effusions. The blinded boy displayed weak light reactions and abundant subdural effusion, whereas the findings in the girl were nearly normal, indicating that a poor light reaction and the presence of massive subdural effusion may predict a poor prognosis. Retinal haemorrhages are important clinical signs of SBS, but brain damage seems to be the primary reason for visual loss, as has been described previously (Kivlin 2001). Our SBS cases confirm earlier observations that it is difficult to estimate visual acuity development based purely on retinal haemorrhage assessment. Retinal haemorrhages without subdural effusion in SBS have not been documented (Green et al. 1996; Blumenthal 2002). However, the girl, who made a recovery, suffered retinal haemorrhages with minimal subdural effusion, indicating that minor brain injury predicts good visual prognosis even though there may be abundant retinal haemorrhaging during the acute phase. The mechanisms that cause retinal haemorrhages in SBS are unclear. It has been suggested that subdural haemorrhage precedes retinal haemorrhage because less force is required to induce tissue injury, and the severity of brain trauma correlates with the extent of retinal haemorrhaging (Green et al. 1996). The extent of retinal haemorrhaging in each of our cases was almost identical, but the course of the recovery was very different, which does not agree with the mechanism proposed by Green et al. (1996). Intraretinal and subhyaloid haemorrhages are often followed by retinal detachment and choroidal and vitreous haemorrhaging (Green et al. 1996; Blumenthal 2002), but neither of our patients developed retinal detachment. Surprisingly, no vitreous detachment could be detected during follow-up. Our female infant, who recovered with minimal brain damage, but with massive retinal bleeding, is perhaps evidence that vigorous vitreous movements may also be an essential factor in evoking retinal haemorrhages. Retinal photographs of SBS children are not seen very often, although it is quite possible to take photographs of usable quality. We would like to encourage medical personnel to photograph the retinas of SBS cases for follow-up and for use by advocacy experts who take these cases to court. The babies in our cases showed only minor signs of external injuries. Their eyeballs appeared to be externally intact and they had no bone fractures. Nonetheless, major pathological retinal changes were observed during the acute phase. Therefore, general practitioners, paediatricians and ophthalmologists should be aware of the seriousness of SBS, even with minimal or no external signs of child abuse. Thus, consulting with an ophthalmologist is always advisable when SBS is suspected.",

      "abstract": "Narcolepsy is a chronic hypersomnia characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) and manifestations of disrupted rapid eye movement sleep stage (cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and hypnagogic/hypnopompic hallucinations). Mechanisms underlying narcolepsy are not fully understood. Experimental data indicate that the disease is caused by a loss of hypocretin neurons in the hypothalamus, likely due to an autoimmune process triggered by environmental factors in susceptible individuals. Most patients with narcolepsy and cataplexy have very low hypocretin-1 levels in the cerebrospinal fluid. An appropriate clinical history, polysomnogram, and multiple sleep latency test are necessary for diagnosis of the disease. Additionally, two biological markers, i.e., cerebrospinal fluid hypocretin-1 levels and expression of the DQB1*0602 gene, are used. The treatment of narcolepsy is aimed at the different symptoms that the patient manifests. Excessive daytime sleepiness is treated with psychostimulants (amphetamine-like, modafinil and armodafinil). Cataplexy is treated with sodium oxybate (GHB), tricyclic antidepressants, or selective serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors. Sleep paralysis, hallucinations, and fragmented sleep may be treated with sodium oxybate. Patients with narcolepsy should follow proper sleep hygiene and avoid strong emotions.",

      "abstract": "Background: Hyperlexia is the phenomenon of spontaneous and precocious mastery of single‐word reading that has been of interest to clinicians and researchers since the beginning of the last century. Methods: An extensive search of publications on the subject of hyperlexia was undertaken and all available publications were reviewed. Results: The literature can be subdivided into discussions of the following issues: (1) whether hyperlexia is a phenomenon that is characteristic only of specific clinical populations (e.g., children with developmental delays) or whether it can also be observed in the general population; (2) whether hyperlexia is a distinct syndrome comorbid with a number of different disorders or whether it is a part of the spectrum of some other clinical condition(s); (3) whether hyperlexia should be defined through single‐word reading superiority with regard to reading comprehension, vocabulary, general intelligence, any combination of the three, or all three characteristics; (4) whether there is a specific neuropsychological profile associated with hyperlexia; (5) whether hyperlexia is characterized by a particular developmental profile; and (6) whether hyperlexia should be viewed as a disability (deficit) or superability (talent). Conclusions: We interpret the literature as supporting the view that hyperlexia is a superability demonstrated by a very specific group of individuals with developmental disorders (defined through unexpected single‐word reading in the context of otherwise suppressed intellectual functioning) rather than as a disability exhibited by a portion of the general population (defined through a discrepancy between levels of single‐word reading and comprehension). We simultaneously argue, however, that multifaceted and multi‐methodological approaches to studying the phenomenon of hyperlexia, defined within the research framework of understanding single‐word reading, are warranted and encouraged.",

Techniques HypnosisHypnosis is the induction of a deeply relaxed state, with increased suggestibility and suspension of critical faculties.Once in this state, sometimes called a hypnotic trance, patients are given therapeutic suggestions to encourage changes in behaviour or relief of symptoms.For example, in a treatment to stop smoking a hypnosis practitioner might suggest that the patient will no longer find smoking pleasurable or necessary.Hypnosis for a patient with arthritis might include a suggestion that the pain can be turned down like the volume of a radio.Some practitioners use hypnosis as an aid to psychotherapy.The rationale is that in the hypnotised state the conscious mind presents fewer barriers to effective psychotherapeutic exploration, leading to an increased likelihood of psychological insight.Franz Mesmer, 1734-1815, was responsible for the rise in popularity, and notoriety, of hypnosis (\"mesmerism\") in the 18th century Many relaxation techniques aim to increase awareness of areas of chronic unconscious muscle tension.They often involve a conscious attempt to release and relax during exhalation",

Objectives Presentation of a clinical case of a PNES in a patient with a diagnose of secondary epilepsy, illustrating the relevance of an adequate evaluation, differential diagnosis, and intervention. Methods Description of the clinical case, with brief literature review and discussion. A search was conducted on PubMed and other databases, using the MeSH terms “nonepileptic seizure”, and “epileptic seizure”. Results We report the case of a 45-year-old female patient, brought to the emergency department because of tonic axial and limb nonsynchronous movements, closed eyes, long duration, with immediate awareness, no desaturation, tongue bite, facial flushing, dyspnoea or sphincter incontinency. She was medicated with clonazepam 1 mg and levetiracetam 1000 mg ev. TC-CE had no acute alteration. Bloodwork had no other major alteration except valproic acid below therapeutic levels (her usual medication, along with other antiepileptic drugs, antidepressant and antipsychotic). The antecedents of the patient: mild intellectual disability and an accidental traumatic brain injury in infancy, with secondary epilepsy. She was transferred to Psychiatry department. No electroencephalogram (EEG) was realized, because she had a recent one confirming PNES, and many other emergency observations with the diagnosis of PNES. Conclusions This clinical case showcases the diagnostic difficulties that clinicians face when there is an overlap in symptoms, emphasizing the need to combine patient history, witness reports, clinician observations, and ictal and interictal EEG to help distinguish these different clinical identities.

      "abstract": "Purpose: To study the consequences of chronic drug use on human's cognitive functions. Methods/Procedures: Review of scientific studies. New Results: Chronic drug use indeed impacts negatively on human's cognitive functions, especially in terms of attention, learning, and memory. With increasing amount of certain drug use, the degree of impairments also increases. It is unsure if the memory deficits that result from drug abuse persist forever as study examining memory impairments after more than a month's abstinence of drug use is not found. Conclusion: Therefore, it is incorrect to say that drug users or ex-drug users are incapable of learning; instead, as a result of neurological changes in the brain caused by chronic drug use, learning may take more time and effort for them as compared to non-drug users.",

      "title": "The Use of Adrenal Cortical Hormone in Radiation Sickness",
      "abstract": "Radiation sickness has up to now been considered exclusively as a complication in radiation therapy. Recently this syndrome has attracted more general interest as an important effect of exposure to radiations generated during nuclear fission (atom splitting) (1). The problem of treating radiation sickness has consequently become one of great timeliness and importance. Advances in the study of clinical signs and symptoms of this condition and their etiology have opened new avenues of approach for its treatment. In the light of present-day knowledge, radiation sickness represents a symptom complex involving numerous systems of the body. The symptoms may be grouped as follows (2): General Symptoms Headaches, dizziness, weakness, and occasionally fever Gastro-intestinal Symptoms Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and tenesmus Cardiovascular Symptoms Tachycardia, arrhythmia, and fall in blood pressure Hematological Symptoms Leukopenia, thrombopenia, and increased sedimentation rate Psychic Symptoms Irritability, insomnia, and fear The symptomatology of radiation sickness points to adrenal cortical insufficiency. Further signs in this direction can be found in a study of the metabolic changes occurring in the irradiated body (3). Most prominent among these are the loss of chlorides, disturbance of the water metabolism, decrease of blood cholesterol levels with increased fat deposits in the liver (4), and a biphasic response of the blood sugar and of the hydrogen-ion concentration in blood and tissues. Radiation sickness thus represents a typical case of the “adaptation syndrome” of Selye (5), i.e., the unspecific response of the body to stress, irrespective of its causation by chemicals, bacterial toxins, or physical agents. The course of the adaptation syndrome is largely determined by adrenal cortical activity. This modern concept of radiation sickness agrees perfectly with the long-accepted view of the etiology of radiation sickness as a general intoxication due to tissue decomposition products (3). Research work of recent years has considerably clarified the nature of these toxic substances. In the light of these investigations the toxic agent might best be described as histamine-like in nature, if not histamine itself, for the following reasons: (a) Histamine is capable of producing most of the symptoms of radiation sickness, including those of salt/water metabolism and cholesterol metabolic changes (6), which are prominent in radiation sickness (8). (b) Histamine is also capable of producing fatty changes in the liver (33), as characteristic of the adaptation syndrome (5) and as seen in various animal species following irradiation (4). The accumulated evidence indicates that these fatty changes in the livers of irradiated animals are largely produced indirectly as the result of tissue decomposition products (4). It has furthermore been demonstrated that fatty infiltration of the liver does not occur in adrenalectomized animals (7).",

Une des raisons est probablement la confusion sur ce qui peut être attribué à l’âge ou aux effets de l’alcool. De plus, ces derniers imitent certains symptômes d’autres maladies et troubles, par exemple les troubles anxieux, la dépression ou la démence. La plupart des outils de dépistage sont insuffisamment adaptés aux personnes âgées et l’estimation de l’abus d’alcool chez celles-ci varie largement selon les méthodes utilisées. La vieillesse devient également un facteur de fragilisation face à la consommation d’alcool surtout si la personne âgée présente des problèmes de santé. Les alcoolisations sont souvent une réponse à la solitude, à l’isolement ou à la perte de soutien social et à l’anxiété, à la dépression et au stress. L’efficacité des interventions brèves dans le cas d’abus d’alcool chez les adultes âgés a été soulignée par ses résultats. L’approche clinique cognitive sur les addictions met l’accent sur l’importance des croyances concernant le produit d’alcoolisation. Certaines trouvent leur source dans l’âge de la personne.",

After the smoking of cannabis and haloperidol, the patient presented to the emergency department (ED) with suicidal ideation, psychosis, and acute dystonia. With the administration of intramuscular diphenhydramine at the ED, the dystonia resolved in less than an hour. To our knowledge, this is the first report on haloperidol misuse by smoking.Clinicians should be aware that patients might misuse prescribed antipsychotics via unconventional routes, potentially combined with other substances.",

      "title": "Therapeutics for the Treatment of Insomnia",
      "abstract": "Abstract Insomnia is a disorder characterized by chronic sleep disturbance associated with daytime disability or distress, such as memory impairment and fatigue, that occurs despite adequate opportunity for sleep. Insomnia may present as difficulty falling/staying asleep or as sleep that is nonrestorative. Studies show a strong correlation between insomnia and impaired quality of life. Pain conditions and depression are commonly associated with insomnia, either as secondary or comorbid conditions. In addition, a greater incidence of anxiety, alcohol and drug dependence, and cardiovascular disease is found in people with insomnia. Data indicate insomnia results from over-engaged arousal systems. Insomnia patients experience increased metabolic rate, body temperature, and heart rate, and elevated levels of norepinephrine and catecholamines. Pharmacologic options for the treatment of insomnia include benzodiazepine hypnotics, a selective melatonin receptor agonist, and sedating antidepressants. However, insomnia may be best treated with cognitive-behavioral therapy and instruction in good sleep hygiene, either alone or in concert with pharmacologic agents. Studies on the effects of insomnia treatment use variable methodologies or do not publish negative results, and there are currently no studies of treatment focusing on morbidity. Further research is necessary to better understand the effects of insomnia therapies on medical and psychiatric disorders. In this Clinical Information Supplement, Thomas Roth, PhD, describes the nature of insomnia and its pathophysiology. Next, Andrew D. Krystal, MD, MS, reviews morbidities associated with insomnia. Finally, Joseph A. Lieberman III, MD, MPH, provides an overview of therapeutics utilized in patients with insomnia, including behavioral therapies and pharmacologic options.",

      "title": "Developmental Dyslexia: An Update",
      "abstract": "Definitions Developmental dyslexia, also known as specific reading disability, is an unexpected difficulty in learning to read that occurs in the otherwise normal child. Rudel1 suggests it be defined by both exclusionary and inclusionary criteria. Her strict definition requires that five criteria be met: 1) The child must have no major neurologic abnormalities, such as overt cerebral palsy. Affected children may and often do have \"soft\" signs on neurologic examination, however. 2) The major sensory functions must be normal; the child cannot be blind or deaf. Practically speaking, children who are blind or deaf or who have cerebral palsy may be dyslexic if they have reading difficulties disproportionate to their other academic and intellectual abilities. 3) The child should have no major psychiatric problems. Problems with self-esteem are often, however, a reactive secondary issue in the child who has a learning disability. 4) Normal intelligence is required, using either a verbal or nonverbal measure. Children who have dyslexia often also have language problems. Hence, verbal intelligence scores may not reflect overall intellectual abilities accurately. 5) Finally, the dyslexic child must have been in a social and educational environment conducive to learning to read. Several studies of inner-city school children have demonstrated that enrichment programs help some nonreaders become readers, demonstrating the importance of teaching techniques.",

There are three subtypes of ADHD: predominantly inattentive; predominantly hyperactive-impulsive; and combined type. For a diagnosis of ADHD to be made: onset of symptoms has to occur before the age of seven, symptoms should have been present longer than 6 months and they must be causing significant impairment. The prevalence of ADHD is at least 5%. Two-thirds of children with ADHD continue to have symptoms in adolescence. At the age of 25, half will still have symptoms which continue to cause significant impairment. ADHD is associated with an increased rate of other disorders: mood disorders; anxiety; other behavioural disorders; autism spectrum disorders; tic disorders; specific learning difficulties; developmental co-ordination disorder and sleep disorders.

      "title": "Antidepressants for the Treatment of Insomnia Approach",
      "abstract": "by a large amount of convincing data, but rather by opinions and beliefs of the prescribing physicians on the advantages of these agents compared with drugs acting on the benzodiazepine receptor or other drugs used for the treatment of insomnia. The existing data do not allow for clear-cut, evidence-based recommendations concerning the use of antidepressants in insomnia. Our conclusions result from a few short-term studies on single agents, clinical experience and inferences from knowledge on the effect of antidepressants in other indications. At present, prescribing antidepressants for short-term treatment of insomnia can be useful if there is some amount of concomitant depressive symptomology or a history of depression, raising the impression that the present insomnia may be a prodromal sign for a new depressive episode. In all other cases, benzodiazepine receptor agonists, especially the nonbenzodiazepines among them (the so-called ‘z drugs’) should be the drugs of choice. For long-term treatment, antidepressants are among the pharmacological options, in addition to other groups of psychotropics. Off-label use of antidepressants may be considered for chronic insomnia if there is a concomitant depressive symptomalogy (which is not so pronounced that an antidepressant treatment with adequate higher doses would be required) and if there is no specific indication for one of the other groups of psychotropics (e.g. dementia-related nocturnal agitation, in which case an antipsychotic would be preferred, or circadian problems, in which case melatonin or a melatonin agonist would be favoured). If antidepressants are used to treat insomnia, sedating ones should be preferred over activating agents such as serotonin reuptake inhibitors. In general, drugs lacking strong cholinergic activity should be preferred. Drugs blocking serotonin 5-HT2A or 5-HT2C receptors should be preferred over those whose sedative property is caused by histamine receptor blockade only. The dose should be as low as possible (e.g. as an initial dose: doxepin 25 mg, mirtazapine 15 mg, trazodone 50 mg, trimipramine 25 mg). Regarding the lack of substantial data allowing for evidence-based recommendations, we are facing a clear need for well designed, long-term, comparative studies to further define the role of antidepressants versus other agents in the management of insomnia.",
