      "title": "Tic Disorders",
      "abstract": "Tics are sudden, abrupt, short, nonrhythmic, repetitive, involuntary movements or vocal productions that serve no recognizable purpose. They wax and wane spontaneously over time and look like fragments of normal movements. Their frequency may increase in situations of stress or challenge and during emotional excitement. The symptomatology is attenuated during sleep and by goal-oriented behavior/concentration. Tics can be voluntarly suppressed for limited periods of time; the sensory-motor phenomena before a tic may be used as signal. Apart from simple movements and vocal impulses, more complex motor (e.g., slapping oneself, hopping, copropraxia = obscene gesturing, echopraxia = imitation of others) and linguistic discharges (such as coprolalia = use of obscene language, palilalia = repetition of the most recently spoken syllables or words and echolalia = repetition of words spoken by others) can also occur. The combination of chronic (lasting longer than a year) vocal and multiple motor tics is termed Tourette syndrome (TS). The indication and choices for pharmaco therapy (e.g., tiapride, risperidone, aripiprazole) within a broader therapeutic framework will be presented, including the pharmacological strategy with comorbid mental disorders like ADHD and OCD.",

Primary stereotypies are those occurring in otherwise neurologically normal children. Common manifestations include head nodding, body rocking, finger waving, and arm flapping.

      "abstract": "Concussions are caused by a physical blow or jolt to the head resulting in either forces applied directly to the head (eg, a pitcher being struck by a batted ball) or movement of the brain within the skull (eg, anterioreposterior deceleration or rotational forces experienced in motor vehicle crash). Such forces disrupt normal cellular processes in the brain. Concussions are seen in all age, gender and ethnic groups but, because they are commonly sustained during sports and recreational activities, they have frequently been described in children. The estimated incidence of sports-related concussions in the USA ranges from 300000 to 3.8 million annually. 2 Estimating incidence is difficult because sports-related concussions frequently go undetected due to a lack of recognition of symptoms or intentional underreporting of symptoms. 34 Symptoms include physical complaints (eg, headache, fatigue, dizziness, noise intolerance), behavioural changes (eg, mood swings, depression, anxiety, irritability) and cognitive impairment (eg, inability to concentrate, decreased memory). While initial symptoms typically resolve in several days to occasionally several months after the injury, 5e8 in 10e15% these symptoms can persist much longer. Because of the heterogeneity of these injuries and their recovery, as well as the recognition that the length of time until symptoms resolve is more important clinically than the type of symptoms, grading scales and classification schemes have been abandoned. Of primary concern is determining when it is safe for the concussed patient to return to normal activities. Such activities mayincludemorephysicallystrenuousgameplayforathletes,but also simply the cognitive exercise of classwork for students or work for adults. Currently accepted guidelines indicate that return should not occur until the concussed patient can accomplish a stepwise progression of increased activity while remaining symptom free. 9 The risks of premature return to activities has",

      "abstract": "Patients with mental disorders exhibit a range of abnormal movements. The severely depressed are given to hand wringing, pacing, and restlessness. Others lie in bed, stare into space, and posture for hours or days. At times, this behavior is so extreme as to be a stupor. Psychotic patients exhibit tremors or peculiar facial and body movements described as parkinsonism, dystonia, or dyskinesia. Manic patients are in constant motion. Children and adolescents bang their heads and pick at their skin, injuring themselves. Little attention is paid to such behavior unless it overwhelms the patient’s life, but it does distress the patient, the family, and the community. These motor symptoms often bring psychiatric patients to medical care. Catatonia is the motor syndrome characterized by muscular rigidity, unusual posturing, negativism (refusal to obey simple commands), mutism (persistent silence), echolalia (repetition of what has been said), echopraxia (imitation of movements), and repeated stereotyped mannerisms. It appears suddenly and quickly immobilizes the patient or it appears insidiously. When it dominates behavior and threatens the patient’s life by the failure to eat or drink, treatment becomes compulsory. Forced feeding, bedsores resulting from immobility, muscular atrophy, bladder catheterization and consequent infection, and blood clots in immobilized limbs all take a terrible toll. If the clots move to the lungs or brain, stroke or death may ensue. Catatonia was first described as a consequence of intense emotional anguish and tension. Although the movements frequently respond to sedative drugs, ECT is a more complete and effective treatment. The condition is frequently seen in patients with affective illnesses— both depression and mania—in patients with systemic disorders, and in those with toxic brain states caused by hallucinogenic drugs. For decades, the prevailing belief in psychiatry was that each instance of catatonia represented a type of schizophrenia. The major classification systems in psychiatry—the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association and the International Classification of Diseases—assigned to all patients with catatonia the diagnosis of schizophrenia, catatonic type. As a consequence, few patients were treated with anticonvulsant sedatives or with ECT, because those treatments were not recognized as effective in schizophrenia.",

Developmental defects of the neural tube, such an various form of myelomeningocele, which manifest themselves during the early stages of the intrauterine life, have an impact on the individuals further development. Its intensity depends on the extend of the defect itself, the feasibility of its correction (usually by surgical means) and a number of external, environmental factors which have an indirect influence on a child's development. The psychological consequences of such defects take the form of various disturbances in the development of cognitive processes: mainly the perception of the outside world and the formation of the cognitive structures involved in self-image formation. At every stage of his and her development, an individual of with a neural-tube defects is subject to many forms of social influence. These may either stimulate or hamper development. It is possible that mental development deficiencies observed in some individuals at a later stage result not so much from the defect itself as from the lack of appropriate social stimuli. The specific problems of children and adolescents (aged 13 to 17) with sacro-lumbar myelomeningocele have been discussed on the basic of a pilot study conducted at the hospital in Radziszów in the years 1996-1998.",

      "title": "[Psychomotor epilepsy: phenomenology, localization, pathogenesis and therapy].",
      "abstract": "Next to tonic-clonic seizures psychomotor (complex focal) seizures are the most common form of all epileptic seizures, except in infancy where they are seen rarely. Differently from generalised non convulsive seizures (like petit mal absences), their first appearance has no typical age limit, however, their proportion to other forms of seizures increases in adolescence and adults especially between the third and fifth decade of life. The main symptom is the disorder of consciousness which lasts at least more than half a minute, normally several minutes in completely distinct seizures, which doesn't begin abruptly and which often ends ill defined. This twilight attack is proceeded by an aura of sensory, psychic or vegetative character. The aura is followed either by a transitory state of immobility and later by motor phenomena or at once by motor phenomena in the form of diverse automatisms of variable intensity, reaching from mild movements in the oral region over verbal expressions to highly dramatic scenes, often accompanied by vegetative symptoms. Tonic versive and tonic symmetrical or tonic asymmetrical seizure symptoms are quite often motor variants which also can lead to sudden drops. Psychomotor attacks can be reduced to \"pseudo-absences\", however, they also can develop into tonic-clonic seizures (Grand mal). Generally, the succession of seizure symptoms is constant in the same patient, the expression can differ from seizure to seizure. Psychomotor attacks can be spread over the whole day or can show a strict connection to sleep, in the course they can likely occur in clusters and can accumulate to a continuous or discontinuous form of psychomotor status epilepticus. Predominantly, but not exclusively psychomotor attacks start from the temporal lobe, whereas neocortical temporal attacks (especially of lateral posterior origin) can be distinguished from those coming from the limbic system, especially from hippocampal or mesio-basal temporal structures and from the nucleus amygdalae. About 20% of the psychomotor attacks are of frontal origin coming from the mesial frontal region or from the gyrus cinguli anterior. Also seizures of occipital or parietal origin can spread so quickly that the seizure itself is impressing as a \"temporal lobe attack\". On account of that, epilepsies with psychomotor attacks cannot be compared to temporal lobe epilepsies. The etiology of psychomotor epilepsies is closely connected to the topographic site of the temporal lobe, who is especially vulnerable for traumatic lesions, cerebral edema and hypoxemia. Also small dysgeneses, heterotopies or small abnormalities of vessels are relatively often found in surgical specimens.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

Hair pulling as a symptom has been reported to occur in association with many conditions, including normal development, personality and developmental disorders, and psychosis (2). In contrast, the syndrome of trichotillomania appears to arise de novo and is characterized by urge-driven, repetitive hair pulling, increased tension when pulling is resisted, and a sense of relief after pulling (DSM-IV). Substantial distress and noticeable hair loss are also diagnostic; the condition is frequently chronic and unremitting (2). The pathology of trichotillomania spans both neurological and psychosocial domains, and we present here a case that illustrates many of the complexities of the phenomenology and treatment of this disorder (3–5).",

Chronic dystonia can occur either locally (eg, writer's cramp, blepharospasm) or systemically as part of CP or other neurological syndromes.\n\nThe management of spasticity and chronic dystonia in children requires multidisciplinary management including neurologists, paediatricians, surgeons, GPs, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and pharmacists. Pharmacotherapy forms one aspect of this management and will be the focus of this review article, but other interventions, such as physical therapy, orthopaedic surgery and procedures, such as selective dorsal rhizotomy, play a major role too. Fundamental knowledge of pharmacologic properties and toxicities of these medications is required for safe and appropriate use, and should be part of an integrated therapeutic approach in which patients, carers, therapists, physicians and surgeons have open and clear communication about the overall rehabilitation process of the patient.\n\n### Oral/enteral drugs\n\nOral, or enteral medication, can provide systemic treatment for the relief of generalised spasticity via different pharmacological mechanisms.

The current diagnostic criteria for TS exclude other causes of tics (1,2). Because tics may be confused with other hyperkinetic movement disorders, it is imperative that the full spectrum of phenomenology of tics is appreciated. Tics are characterized by abrupt, repetitive movements (motor tics) or sounds (phonic tics), commonly preceded by a premonitory sensation of an urge, tension, discomfort, or other sensory phenomena (3,4). Motor tics may be classified as either (1) simple tics, involving only one group of muscles, or (2) complex tics, which are coordinated, sequenced movements resembling normal motor acts or gestures (5). Simple motor tics are further classified by frequency and duration of the muscle contraction into clonic, dystonic, or tonic.Clonic tics are abrupt, brief, rapid, jerklikemovements, suchas excessive blinking andother facial twitches or head andneck jerks. Tics involving briefly sustained muscle contractions have been classified as dystonic and tonic tics. Dystonic tics consist of associated twisting or gyrating motions such as oculogyric or rotatory shoulder movements. Tonic tics involve isometric contractions such as abdominal or limb tensing.

      "title": "Neurodevelopmental movement disorders - an update on childhood motor stereotypies",
      "abstract": "The term 'stereotypies' encompasses a diverse range of movements, behaviours, and/or vocalizations that are repetitive, lack clear function, and sometimes appear to have a negative impact upon an individual's life. This review aims to describe motor stereotypies.This study reviewed the current literature on the nature, aetiology, and treatment of motor stereotypies.Motor stereotypies occur commonly but not exclusively in autistic spectrum disorders. Similar movements are also found in otherwise healthy children and those suffering sensory impairment, social isolation, or severe intellectual disabilities; they may be persistent over time. Although often difficult, it is possible to define and differentiate stereotypies from other movement disorders such as tics through features of the history, such as earlier onset and examination, together with the presence or absence of associated neurological impairment or developmental difficulties. Co-occurrence with other disorders affecting frontostriatal brain systems, including attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and tic disorders, is common.The underlying function of motor stereotypies remains unclear but may include the maintenance of arousal levels. A neurogenetic aetiology is proposed but requires further study. When treatment is sought, there are both pharmacological and behavioural options. Behavioural treatments for motor stereotypies may in time be shown to be most effective; however, they are difficult to implement in children younger than 7 years old.",

Subtypes of schizophrenia (paranoid, disorganized, catatonic, undifferentiated, residual) 1) Paranoid (best outcome)a) Presence of delusions (often persecutory) b) Frequent auditory hallucinations c) Onset of illness (late 20s or 30s) later than forother subtypes d) More likely to marry and have children2) Disorganized (formally called hebephrenic) a) Display disorganized, nonproductive behaviorsand demonstrate disorganized speech patterns b) Exhibit flat or inappropriate affect; grimacing iscommon c) Can act silly or childlike and burst out laughing forno reason d) Delusions and hallucinations are less organizedand fragmentary e) Earlier onset3) Catatonic (less commonly seen now than in previous years) a) According to DSM-IV-TR, must have at least twoof the following: i) Motoric immobility (catalepsy, stupor) ii) Excessive motor activityTable 6-1. DelusionsDelusion Definitioniii) Extreme negativism iv) Stereotypies, mannerisms, grimacing v) Echolalia, echopraxia4) Undifferentiated: these patients do not satisfy criteria for any other schizophrenia subtype5) Residual: according to DSM-IV-TR, these patients no longer have any major psychotic symptoms but still exhibit evidence of the illness, with negative symptoms or at least 2 other odd or eccentric behaviors or perceptual experiences6) Psychiatric terms and definitions are listed in Table 6-24. Course a. Chronic, usually early onset, poor long-term outcome,devastating illness 1) Prodromal phase: often prolonged period of socialwithdrawal, delayed developmental milestones, awkward in motor skills, loss of interest in self-care2) Active phase: psychotic symptoms appear, diagnosis is made more clear3) Residual phase: similar to prodomal phase b. Prognostic features and indicators1) Good outcome a) Acute onset, short duration, no previous psychi-atric history, no family history of schizophrenia b) Mood symptoms present, sensorium clouded c) No obsessive-compulsive disorder, noassaultiveness d) Premorbid functioning good, high socioeconomicclass e) Married, good psychosexual functioning f) Normal findings on neuroimaging2) Poor outcome a) Insidious onset, chronic duration, psychiatric his-tory present, positive family history of schizophreniab) Mood symptoms absent, sensorium clear c) Obsessive-compulsive disorder is present,assaultiveness is present d) Poor premorbid functioning, low socioeconomicclasse) Never married, poor psychosexual functioning f) Structural abnormalities present on neuroimaging5. Epidemiology a. Prevalence over lifetime is about 1.0% (no differencesworldwide) b. Average age at onset: men, 21 years (17-27 years);women, 27 years (17-37 years) c. Male (M):Female (F) equal frequency d. M>F in severity of illness, negative symptoms, suiciderisk e. F>M in mood comorbidity, better prognosis, bettersocial functioning f. Onset before age 10 and after age 45 are uncommon6. Etiology a. \"Two-hit\" or \"multiple-hit\" idea has strong support: thesubject may have genetic predisposition to develop schizophrenia but does not manifest it unless other factors are encountered (e.g., environmental stressors)b. GeneticsTable 6-2. Psychiatric Terms and DefinitionsSchizophrenia Prognostic Factors Better prognosis: female, older onset, married, good premorbid functioning, acute onset, mood symptoms present, clouded sensorium, short duration1) Siblings of schizophrenics: 10% develop schizophrenia 2) Children of parent with schizophrenia: 6% chance 3) Children of both parents with schizophrenia: 46%chance 4) Twins: nearly 50% chance for monozygotic and 17%chance for dizygotic twins 5) Multiple linkages (chromosomes 3p, 5q, 6p, 6q, 8p,10p, 13q, 15q, 18p, 22q) 6) Large trinucleotide repeats: CAG/CTG on chromo-somes 17 and 18 7. Neuroanatomical findings on imaginga. Most consistent finding is ventricular enlargement, especially third and lateral ventriclesb. Selective reduction in size of frontal lobe, basal ganglia, thalamus, and limbic regions, including the hippocampus and medial temporal lobec. Possible decrease in volume of neocortical and deep gray matterd. Sulcal widening, especially frontal and temporal areas e. Some studies indicate small but significant difference inbrain and intracranial volume f. Increased incidence of1) Cavum septum pellucidum 2) Partial callosal agenesis8. Functional neuroimaging a. Hypofrontality (frontal and prefrontal cortex): negativesymptoms and neurocognitive deficits b. Positron emission tomographic (PET) studies implicatefrontal cortex (orbital, dorsolateral, medial), anterior cingulate gyrus, thalamus, several temporal lobe subregions, and cerebellumc. PET studies: anatomic substrate for visual hallucinations in schizophrenia 1) Inferotemporal cortex is responsible for visual recogni-tion of objects and faces 2) Basal ganglia output (primarily substantia nigra parsreticulata) to inferotemporal cortex with relay in ventral anterior thalamic nucleus-influences visualprocessing and causes altered visual perception (hallucinations) as a result of increased dopaminergic activity in basal ganglia (may also be the mechanism of hallucinations in parkinsonian syndromes sensitive to dopaminergic agents [diffuse Lewy body disease more so than idiopathic Parkinson disease])9. Neuropathology a. Decreased cell density in the dorsomedial nucleus ofthalamus b. Displacement of interneurons in frontal lobe cortex c. Developmental issues1) History of injury at birth may contribute to development of schizophrenia2) Season of birth: more schizophrenics are born in early spring or winter10. Neurochemical considerations a. Dopamine hypothesis: excess of dopamine linked topsychotic symptoms 1) Dopamine-blocking drugs seemed to lessen psychoticsymptoms (antipsychotics) 2) Drugs stimulating dopamine release caused psychoticsymptoms (amphetamine, cocaine) 3) Five types of dopamine receptors: D1, D2, D3, D4,D5 a) D1: located in cerebral cortex and basal ganglia b) D2: located in striatum c) D3 and D4: high concentration in the limbicsystem d) D5: located in thalamus, hippocampus, andhypothalamus 4) Hyperactivity of dopamine system (especially D2receptor): thought important to positive symptoms of schizophreniab. Postmortem findings in schizophrenics 1) Increased dopamine or homovanillic acid in limbicareas and left amygdala (may be consequence of treatment with antipsychotics)c. PET used to measure receptor occupancy of antipsychotic medications 1) Typicals: D2 receptors (78% receptor occupancy), noobvious D1 receptors 2) Atypicals: D2 receptors (48%), D1 receptors (38%-52%), D1 receptors are associated with fewer extrapyramidal symptoms11. Clinical management (see PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY AND OTHER TREATMENTS) a. Mainstay treatments: antipsychotics (D2 receptor block-ers [postsynaptic]) b. Treatment1) First line, atypicals (may improve neurocognitiveSchizophrenia Genetics Twin studies: nearly 50% monozygotic, 17% dizygoticChromosomes implicated: 3p, 5q, 6p, 6q, 8p, 10p, 13q, 15q, 18p, 22qTrinucleotide repeat (CAG/CTG) on chromosomes 17 & 18impairment in schizophrenia): risperidone (Risperdal), olanzapine (Zyprexa), quetiapine (Seroquel), ziprasidone (Geodon), aripiprasole (Abilify)2) Second line: clozapine (Clozaril), is atypical, expensive, and needs monitoring because of the potential for severe agranulocytosis3) Typicals (may worsen neurocognitive functioning): chlorpromazine (Thorazine), thioridazine (Mellaril), perphenazine (Trilafron), loxapine (Loxitane), trifluoperazine (Stelazine), thiothixene (Navane), haloperidol (Haldol), fluphenazine (Prolixin)c. Maintenance therapy, for at least 1 to 2 years after the initial psychotic episoded. Alternative treatments 1) Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT): schizophrenia doesnot typically respond to ECT, but it could be considered for catatonic schizophrenia2) Many benefit from benzodiazepines, mood stabilizers, antidepressants12. Psychosocial intervention strategies a. Emphasis on outpatient treatment b. Partial hospitalization, day treatments, outpatient care c. Family therapy reduces relapse rate d. Self-help organizations e. Cognitive therapy techniques: the goal is to remediatethe abnormal thought processes f. Social skills training: little effect on risk of relapse g. Psychosocial rehabilitation1) Restore the patient's ability to function in the community2) Appropriate/affordable housing, group homes 3) Vocational training 4) Assertive community treatmentB.

The distinction between accidental and nonaccidental patterns of injury is the crux of the issue in examining a deceased infant with clinical or autopsy evidence of trauma, and will be the focus of this chapter. Penetrating projectile and sharp force injury to the brain and spinal cord are sufficiently rare as to be outside the scope of this discussion. Likewise, deaths due to suffocation, drowning, and arson are not covered here, in part because neuropathologic changes are not specific (see Table 65.1).",

They may also be divided into motor, vocal, or visual stereotypies. Biological mechanisms of stereotypies are unknown but they seem to be related to the basal ganglia or the cortical-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuits. Stereotypies are frequently found in patients with autistic disorders, intellectual disability, and sensorial deficit disorders. Some neurodevelopmental disorders show specific motor stereotypies, which reinforce the notion of a genetic or neurobiological basis. When necessary, treatment may include behavioral or drug-based approaches.",

      "title": "[Emergence of early childhood trauma in adult psychiatric symptomatology].",
      "abstract": "Trauma comes as a result of the subject's exposure to extremely negative and stressful events, such as natural or human-provoked catastrophes, wars, serious injuries, violent deaths, tortures, terrorist attacks, rapes and other sexual crimes. A child's exposure to traumatic circumstances of this level during the crucial period of self-structuring creates rather difficult conditions for its development. Moreover, if the child does not have the opportunity to elaborate and analyze all these stressful conditions and put them into words, serious consequences, both psychological and somatic, may occur in adult life. Specific factors and child characteristics, namely, the age, the developmental stage within which the trauma occurs, its type (physical or sexual abuse, neglect or traumatic social events), frequency, duration and intensity, have been proved to seriously affect the trauma's consequences. The immediate emotional impact of trauma may include isolation, fear, feeling of weakness or loss of the sense of confidence. Moreover, mood disorders such as depression and withdrawal, negative effects on cognitive ability, language development and academic performance, difficulties in creating a secure link and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are also observed. The long-term consequences for the individual's mental health can be expressed through the following: post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) combined or not with depression and anxiety disorder, mood disorders, personality disorders, poor control of impulsions, dissociation disorder, psychotic disorder. Finally, apart from the dramatic impact of trauma on the person itself, there is also a high social cost to be paid as a result of the individual's poor adjustment and dysfunction in the community. Early support and intervention in the child's environment may significantly minimize the negative effects of trauma. Beyond the expression of genes, good maternal care as well as psychological support, lead to normal DNA methylation and brain development. Supporting the family and break the silence that frequently covers the traumatic events and feelings, will give the opportunity for the elaboration of all these aspects which could capture and imprison the subject in a dramatic circle of psychopathology. Moreover, the effectiveness of early interventions and child psychotherapy is now a common ground, so we have to use all our clinical instruments (dialogue, symbolic play, drawing, storytelling) in order to help the child and have the best possible result. Finally, concerning clinical practice, the emergence of early childhood trauma in adult psychiatric symptomatology is so frequent that mental health experts should take it into serious account while developing an appropriate clinical treatment for such patients.",

The motor tics generally involve head and neck jerking, eye blinking, tongue protrusions, shoulder shrugs, and various torso and limb movements. Vocalizations may include barks, grunts, yelps, coughs, repetition of one’s own or other’s words (echolalia), uttering obscenities (coprolalia), and blurting out inappropriate remarks. Other associated behaviors may include inappropriate touching of oneself or others. Often these are coupled with compulsive behaviors.

They can be “primary,” occurring in normal children as a normal physiological variation or “secondary,” occurring in children with autism, intellectual disability, or other developmental disorders. Observation and videotaping are crucial for excluding seizures and other pathological movement disorders. They usually last for seconds to minutes and can occur spontaneously or be triggered by fatigue, excitement, or stress. Another key feature is the ability to suppress these movements by distraction or sensory stimulation. In this article, we aim to present an updated review of this topic and highlight important diagnostic tips and management pitfalls. Recognition of such movements is critical to prevent unnecessary investigations or treatments.",

      "title": "Dystonia",
      "abstract": "Dystonia is a syndrome of sustained muscle contractions that produce involuntary twisting and repetitive movements and abnormal postures of the trunk, neck, face, and extremities. Somewhat confusingly, the term \"dystonia\" has been used to designate a specific type of abnormal movement or posture, a syndrome that occurs secondary to a number of underlying neurologic disorders, and a primary disorder known as \"idiopathic torsion dystonia.\" Dystonic movements can be either slow or rapid and are usually more stereotyped and patterned than movements in chorea (random and unpredictable), myoclonus (brief and shocklike), and tremor (rhythmical and not associated with alterations in posture). Dystonia is characterized by failure of normal reciprocal inhibition, which causes co-contraction of agonist and antagonist muscles accompanied by excessive contraction of other regional muscles. This chapter is limited to conditions characterized by continuous rather than intermittent dystonia and therefore does not include discussion of the paroxysmal dystonias. Psychogenic dystonia is discussed in Chapter 35 together with other functional movement disorders.",

Motor or phonic tics that persist for more than 1 year are defined as persistent (chronic) tic disorder. Tourette syndrome can be diagnosed if a child has multiple motor tics and at least one phonic tic for more than 1 year with onset before age 18 years. Children with Tourette syndrome may have symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, or behavioral disorders. Chorea can be seen as a symptom of rheumatic fever (Sydenham chorea), in children with a history of kernicterus, and in dyskinetic cerebral palsy. Chorea also may be part of an underlying metabolic or genetic condition. Dystonia is characterized by repetitive contortions and posturing of the limbs and body. It can be isolated or part of an underlying neurologic condition. Tremor can occur as a manifestation of essential tremor or can be an enhanced physiologic tremor exacerbated by drugs, illness, or stimulants. Ataxia most often is seen as a postinfectious or postvaccination acute cerebellar ataxia. Progressive ataxias are consistent with an underlying metabolic or genetic condition. Transient and developmental movement disorders include benign neonatal sleep myoclonus, jitteriness in neonates, shuddering, and stereotypies.",

He points out that ideas of negation, systematic or asystematic, are very slow in appearing, and represent generally a phase of evolution of the psychoses or a secondary mental process. Their appearance coincides with the mental decadence due to chronicity or associated with senility. Certain congenital cases do not come under this class, and there is also a group in which there seems to be a “negative disposition” of the individual. From a clinical study one of the following factors is necessary to the production of these ideas: (1) a state of mental weakness produced either by an intoxication or by some other cause acting acutely, or (2) a state of acute, subacute, or chronic pathological pain, or (3) an originally degenerative condition.",

Virtually pathogmonic symptoms include re-experiencing the event through play and ceaselessly repeated behaviors (re-enactments), cognitive distortions when relating the facts (chronological errors, belief in omens), changes in attitudes towards others and life in general, and neurovegetative hyperactivity (hypervigilance, startle responses, difficulties controlling impulses). Although adequate follow-up data are lacking, the disorder can probably become chronic in children, as in adults. This nosographic entity raises the theoretical issue of the roles of life events and individual vulnerability. A number of factors may either \"predispose\" or \"protect\" the child: degree and duration of exposure to the trauma, nature of the event, preexistence of psychiatric disorders, level of cognitive development, sex, degree of social support, and containing or noncontaining attitude of the family. Treatments advocated in adults (pharmacotherapy, cognitive and behavioral therapies, group therapy) remain to be used and evaluated in children.",

      "title": "Action myoclonus, Ramsay Hunt syndrome, and other cerebellar myoclonic syndromes.",
      "abstract": "Action myoclonus, reviewed in this chapter, is the term applied to arrhythmic muscular jerking induced by voluntary movement. It is made worse by attempts at precise or coordinated movement (intention myoclonus) and may also be provoked by certain sensory stimuli. The effective stimuli for action myoclonus is probably feedback from muscle afferents, although it may be initiated by corollary discharge from motor cortex to reticular formation before or at the onset of voluntary movement. The condition is usually associated with diffuse neuronal disease such as post-hypoxic encephalopathy, uremia, and the various forms of PME, although action myoclonus may be limited to one limb in some cases of focal cerebral damage. It is caused by hyperexcitability of the sensorimotor cortex (cortical reflex myoclonus) or reticular formation (reticular reflex myoclonus), or both. No consistent pathological change has been reported in autopsied cases of action myoclonus. The underlying disorder appears to be a loss of inhibitory mechanisms involving serotonin and possibly GABA as transmitter agents. The term PME is used for the association of myoclonus with degenerative changes in the nervous system which are commonly diffuse but may predominate in certain systems. There may or may not be associated tonic-clonic seizures, other manifestations of epilepsy, or dementia. Those cases of PME associated with Lafora inclusion bodies and cerebral storage diseases can be distinguished from the system degenerations. Systems which may be involved in the latter group include cerebellodentatorubral, pyramidal, extrapyramidal, optic, auditory, posterior columns and gracile and cuneate nuclei, spinocerebellar pathways, motor neurons of cranial nerves and anterior horns, and muscle fibers. Confronted with this diversity of pathological change, it seems unnecessary to make any clinical distinction between Ramsay Hunt syndrome and Unverricht-Lundborg syndrome (Baltic myoclonus) because cerebellar signs are found in patients described under both headings. Additional systems may be involved in individuals or families who are otherwise typical. All three names could well be joined in an eponymous title (Unverricht-Lundborg-Hunt disease) or the condition simply known as the systems degeneration type of PME, as Halliday (43) suggested. The cause of the condition (or spectrum of conditions) is at present unknown. Action myoclonus usually responds to sodium valproate or clonazepam, and some individuals, particularly those with posthypoxic myoclonus, improve with the administration of serotonin precursors.",

Although the motor and vocal tics do not need to occur concurrently, the tics need to occur several times a day or more nearly every day or intermittently with no tic‐free interval of more than 3 months for the diagnosis to be given. Motor tics are defined as sudden, rapid, repetitive, stereotyped muscle movements, and vocal tics are similarly rapid and spontaneous vocalizations or repetitive sounds. Motor and vocal tics can be further categorized as simple or complex. Simple motor tics are brief, seemingly insignificant movements involving one muscle location, for example a hard eye blink, shoulder shrug, head tilt, nose twitch, and/or facial grimace. Simple vocal tics are monosyllabic, usually meaningless sounds, such as grunting, throat clearing, sniffing, and/or coughing. Complex tics are longer in duration, can be mistaken as voluntary and purposeful, and involve the coordination of multiple muscle groups, for example spinning, jumping, bending, kicking, touching self or objects, and facial or hand gestures. Complex vocal tics include interpretable noises, such as barking, shouting, or chirping, as well as vocalizations, such as words, phrases, repetition of self (palilalia) or others (echolalia). Coprolalia (e.g., profane language), often thought to be a defining symptom of TD, is quite rare, occurring in only about 10% of cases.",

      "abstract": "For the purpose of this paper, the term disability will encompass the following impairments: disability that can increase vulnerability to abuse resulting from physical, sensory, or mental impairments, or a combination of impairments; physical disability resulting from injury (e.g., spinal cord injury, amputation), chronic disease (e.g., multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis), or congenital conditions (e.g., cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy); sensory impairments consisting of hearing or visual impairments; and mental impairments comprising developmental conditions (e.g., mental retardation), cognitive impairment (e.g., traumatic brain injury), or mental illness. Emotional abuse is being threatened, terrorized, severely rejected, isolated, ignored, or verbally attacked. Physical abuse is any form of violence against one’s body, such as being hit, kicked, restrained, or deprived of food or water. Sexual abuse is being forced, threatened, or deceived into sexual activities ranging from looking or touching to intercourse or rape.",

A tic is a sudden, rapid, repetitive, non-rhythmic movement (e.g. eye blinking) or vocalization (e.g. throat clearing). Tics are often described as semi-voluntary or 'unvoluntary', as, strictly speaking, they are neither voluntary nor involuntary, but may be experienced as a voluntary response to an unwanted distressing sensation called 'premonitory urge'. Premonitory urges are physical 'build-up' sensations to perform specific tics, which are perceived as suppressible yet irresistible, similar to the need to sneeze or scratch an itch. Patients often describe the need to tic as the mounting of inner tension, localized either to the body region where the tic is about to occur or throughout the body. Tic expression is typically associated with a transient sensation of relief.",

      "abstract": "Conduct disorder is the most prevalent psychopathologic condition of childhood. It is characterized by a persistent and repetitive pattern of aggressive, noncompliant, intrusive, and poorly self-controlled behaviors that violate either the rights of others or age-appropriate societal norms.1 These behaviors have a significant impact on the daily functioning of the child or adolescent and on the ability of parents and other adults to manage them. The specific behavioral criteria for the diagnosis of conduct disorder can be conceptualized as either aggressive or nonaggressive in type (Table 1). Examples of aggressive behaviors are physical fighting and bullying, assault, vandalism, purse snatching, physical cruelty to persons or animals, breaking and entering, and arson. More serious aggressive behaviors are armed robbery, rape, and extortion. Nonaggressive behaviors of conduct disorder include substance abuse, persistent truancy, running away from home overnight, frequent lying in a variety of social settings, theft not involving a confrontation with a victim, and chronic violation of rules or the basic rights of others. Three subtypes of conduct disorder are identified in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, revised 3rd edition.1 These are descriptions of the functional contexts in which the particular behavior problems occur. The group type involves problematic behaviors that occur as part of an activity with peers.",

      "title": "Assessing Tremor to Rule out Psychogenic Origin: It's Tricky",
      "abstract": "Tremors are a rhythmic and oscillatory movement of a body part with a relatively constant frequency. (1) Several subtypes of tremors are classified on the basis of whether they occur during static or kinetic body positioning. Assessing tremors to rule out psychogenic origin is one of the trickiest tasks for a psychiatrist (Table 1 (2)). Non-organic movement disorders are not rare, and all common organic movement disorders can be mimicked by presentations. Diagnostic approach Start by categorizing the tremor based on its activation condition (at rest, kinetic or intentional, postural or isometric), topographic distribution, and frequency. Observe the patient sitting in a chair with his hands on his lap for resting tremor. Postural or kinetic tremors can be assessed by stretching the arms and performing a finger-to-nose test. A resting tremor can indicate parkinsonism; intention tremor may indicate a cerebellar lesion. A psychogenic tremor can occur at rest or during postural or active movement, and often will occur in all 3 situations (Table 2, page 26). (1-3) Some of the maneuvers listed in Table 3, page 26 (2) are helpful to distinguish a psychogenic from an organic cause. The key is to look for variability in direction, amplitude, and frequency. Psychogenic tremor often increases when the limb is examined and reduces upon distraction, and also might be exacerbated with movement of other limbs. Patients with psychogenic tremor often have other non-organic neurologic signs, such as give-way weakness, deliberate slowness carrying out requested voluntary movement, and sensory signs that contradict neuroanatomical principles. Investigation Proceed as follows: 1. Perform laboratory testing: thyroid function panel and serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels. (2) 2. Perform surface electromyography to differentiate Parkinson's disease and benign tremor disorders. (2) 3. Obtain a MRI to assess atypical tremor; findings might reveal Wilson's disease (basal ganglia and brainstem involvement) or fragile X-associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (pontocerebellar hypoplasia or cerebral white matter involvement). (3) 4. Consider dopaminergic functional imaging scanning. When positive, the scan can reveal symptoms of parkinsonism; negative findings can help consolidate a diagnosis of psychogenic tremor.

      "abstract": "Apraxia is a term used to denote a wide spectrum of higher order motor disorders that result from acquired brain disease affecting the performance of skilled and/or learned movements with or without preservation of the ability to perform the same movement outside the clinical setting in the appropriate situation or environment. The disturbance of purposive movements cannot be termed apraxia, however, if the patient suffers from any elementary motor or sensory deficit (i.e., paresis, dystonia, ataxia), which could fully explain the abnormal motor behavior, or if it results from a language comprehension disorder or from dementia (1,2). Nevertheless, praxic errors are well defined clinically and kinematically and can be superimposed on elementary motor disorders (3,4). Praxic disturbances may affect specific parts of the body (i.e., limb apraxia, buccofacial apraxia, gait apraxia) and may involve both sides of the body (i.e., ideational and ideomotor apraxias), preferentially one side (i.e., limb-kinetic apraxia) or, alternatively, interlimb coordination, as in the case of gait apraxia.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric disorder defined by symptoms reflecting disturbances in cognitive, behavioral, and physiological functioning that develop in the wake of exposure to a psychologically traumatic event. According to the DSM‐IV‐TR (American Psychiatric Association, 2000), the diagnosis applies to individuals who develop a requisite number of symptoms after experiencing, witnessing, or being confronted with an event that involved perceived or threatened loss of life, serious injury, or loss of physical integrity and that evoked fear, helplessness, or horror (e.g., military combat, sexual or physical assault, serious accidents, and major disasters). DSM‐IV‐TR organizes the symptoms of PTSD under three clusters: (1) reexperiencing (e.g., intrusive thoughts, nightmares, flashbacks, and psychophysiological reactivity to reminders of the trauma), (2) avoidance and emotional numbing (e.g., avoiding stimuli associated with the trauma and inability to experience a full range of emotions), and (3) hyperarousal (e.g., hypervigilance, exaggerated startle response, and sleep disruption). By definition, these symptoms must persist for more than 1 month after the trauma and produce clinically significant distress and/or impairment.",

This condition can lead to the emergence of compulsive behaviors, which are often a form of coping with stress. Compulsive behaviors in fur animals are usually stereotypical: animals walk along the cage, catch their own tail, gnaw fur (trichotilomanie), or bite the trellis or the claws. The environmental factors resulting from the maintenance conditions and social relations of the animals in the group play an important role in the emergence of this type of behavior. Another factor that is equally important in causing compulsive behavior is mental strain resulting from disease..",

      "title": "Vertigo",
      "abstract": "After completing this article, readers should be able to: “Dizziness” is a common complaint that implies a sense of disorientation, usually an altered perception of position in the environment. It may be due to lightheadedness or faintness (eg, the adolescent who has orthostatic hypotension), occur in association with a variety of acute medical disorders (eg, the febrile child who has vomiting and dehydration), or have a psychosomatic origin (eg, depression, anxiety, or exhaustion).Dizziness is formally classified into four categories: vertigo, presyncope, dysequilibrium, and light-headedness. Vertigo is defined as an illusion of movement, most often a sensation of rotation or, less frequently, linear displacement or tilt. Vertigo is the key symptom of vestibular pathology and usually the result of abnormalities of the labyrinth, although it also may be symptomatic of other neurologic disease (eg, seizures or migraines). It typically is accompanied by symptoms of varying degree, including nausea, vomiting, pallor, and perspiration. There is no loss of consciousness.The prevalence of vertigo in children is unknown. A recently published study of Scottish school children reported that 15% had experienced at least one episode of dizziness in a 1-year period. Almost 50% were assessed as having “paroxysmal vertigo” with accompanying symptoms frequently suggestive of migraine (pallor, nausea, phonophobia, and photophobia).The etiology of vertigo may be due to abnormalities of the vestibular, visual, or proprioceptive systems. The labyrinth (the paired organs of equilibrium) consists of three semicircular canals stimulated by angular acceleration and the utricle and saccule stimulated by gravitational forces and vertical acceleration. Impulses pass via the vestibular nerve to the vestibular nuclei in the brainstem and then ascend in the medial longitudinal fasiculus (to the cranial nerves for eye movement) and descend in the vestibulospinal tracts (excitatory stimuli to the extensor muscles of the head, extremities, and trunk for maintenance of upright posture). The cerebellum receives afferent impulses and functions as a center for integrating oculovestibular and postural responses. Cortical vestibular representation is at the level of the posterior temporal gyrus.Vestibular function is assessed by evaluating the oculovestibular reflex and intensity of nystagmus produced by rotatory and caloric stimulation of the labyrinth. The oculovestibular reflex permits ocular fixation on stationary objects while the head and body are in motion.Nystagmus is the observed movement of the eye in response to stimulation of the labyrinth, retrocochlear vestibular, or central vestibulo-ocular pathway. It is classified as spontaneous or induced by direction and by fatigability. The direction of nystagmus is designated by the fast component (ocular realignment). The slow component represents the oculovestibular response.Vertigo may be due to peripheral vestibular disease or central vestibular dysfunction. When not associated with actual movement, the cause of vertigo is found in the peripheral system in 85% of cases. Use of the term “peripheral” implies that the problem occurs either in the end organ (semicircular canals or utricle) or in the peripheral nerve.The clinical presentations differ and allow for localization of the vertiginous symptomatology (Table 1).The medical history is the initial and most important step in evaluation of the child who complains of dizziness or vertigo. Young children may not have the capacity or vocabulary to describe the sensation of vertigo, but they can use “playground synonyms” such as spinning, swinging, sliding, or like “a merry-go-round.” The key symptom is a sensation of motion that is either rotatory or linear.The associated aural and neurologic symptoms must be sought carefully. Are there other symptoms of hearing loss (that may fluctuate), fullness, pressure, or ringing? Is there objective evidence of a hearing disorder? If tinnitus or ringing is present, is it continuous, intermittent, or pausitile? Are there symptoms of cortical or brainstem disorders such as headache, visual changes, seizures, or loss of consciousness?The complete physical examination should focus on neurologic evaluation of the cranial nerves and cerebellar function (past-pointing and tandem gait). The auditory canal and tympanic membranes must be examined to evaluate for evidence of middle ear infection, malformations, cholesteatoma, or a perilymphatic fistula. A fistula test can be performed in a cooperative child with a pneumatic otoscope or tragal pressure. The child is instructed to look straight ahead, and the eyes are examined while continuous positive and then negative pressure is applied. Normally, there should be no drift of the eyes. In the presence of perilymphatic fistula, the eyes may drift slowly away from the ear with positive pressure and back toward the ear with negative pressure.An important sign is the presence of spontaneous or induced nystagmus. Endpoint or physiologic nystagmus is seen in normal children at a 40-degree deviation of the eyes. Because visual fixation may inhibit mild vestibular nystagmus, otolaryngologists use Frenzel glasses (+10 diopters) both to magnify the eyes and to prevent fixation suppression.Clinical testing in the office or emergency department may provide much information about the child or adolescent who has vertigo. Simple tests of balance include the Romberg and Unterberger-Fukuda test (stepping or marching test). The Romberg test evaluates proprioceptive function. A variation of the original examination—the tandem Romberg test—can be performed by having the child place one foot directly in front of the other with the arms either at the sides or crossed in front. Vision is allowed and then excluded. The Unterberger-Fukuda test is performed with the arms placed straight out in front at shoulder height. Vision is excluded, and the child is instructed to maintain the original position and march in place. A total of 50 marching steps should be taken. Normally, patients either will remain in place, step forward up to 50 cms, or turn within approximately 30 degrees of center. Patients who have chronic peripheral vestibular lesions will march slowly toward the side of the lesion.The Hallpike-Dix maneuver should be used during the neurologic examination to elicit paroxysmal positional nystagmus. The child is placed in a sitting position midway on a flat examining table and instructed to look straight ahead at all times. The examiner first turns the head to the side, and the patient then quickly is placed backwards with the head over the end of the table. The response in patients who have a positional vertigo is horizontal rotary nystagmus with the fast phase to the downward ear. The onset of the nystagmus is delayed with typically a 1- to 2-second latency that lasts for 10 to 20 seconds and is associated with a sensation of rotational vertigo. With this positioning maneuver, nystagmus and vertigo occur with the affected ear down. If a diagnosis of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is considered clinically, the Hallpike-Dix maneuver is not recommended because it may interfere with immediate bedside treatment of this disorder.All patients who have symptoms of vertigo must undergo hearing testing or, in infants, auditory brainstem evoked response testing. Additional pediatric investigations depend on the characteristics of the vertigo and accompanying symptoms in the individual patient. Children who have persistent nonspecific vertigo require a complete blood count, glucose tolerance test, and measurement of electrolytes, calcium, phosphorous, magnesium, and thyroid function. Certain patients may require testing for sickle cell disease. Patients who have sensorineural hearing loss or neurologic findings should receive computed tomography with thin cuts through the temporal bones, magnetic resonance imaging (± gadolinium), or angiography. If there is a history of associated loss of consciousness, an electroencephalographic study should be obtained.Based on the course of the symptoms, the physical examination, and the results of the previously noted investigations, the child may require referral to an otolaryngologist for additional vestibular testing. Caloric testing is the definitive procedure for identification of vestibular pathology. Electronystagmography is a collection of examinations for the saccadic, optokinetic, and smooth pursuit systems and of nystagmus induced by warming and cooling the labyrinth. These tests are nonspecific and do not provide a diagnosis, but when results are abnormal, they are suggestive of vestibular dysfunction.Other testing used by otolaryngologists in specific circumstances includes rotating chair tests, vestibular autorotation test (physiologic stimuli of high frequency produced by active head oscillations), and posturography (sway movement testing).Acute-onset vertigo or paroxysmal episodes of vertigo can be approached clinically based on the presence or absence of hearing loss (Table 2). If vertigo is continuous and unremitting, assessment can be based on the presence or absence of neurologic abnormalities (Table 3). The diagnosis of labyrinthitis is based on a history of infection preceding the onset of vertigo and the presence of hearing impairment. The child usually is most comfortable lying on the unaffected side. Any movement causes severe vertigo, nausea, and vomiting. These episodic symptoms usually subside after several days. This condition is much more frequent in children than had been recognized in the past and often is caused by minor head trauma. There is a sudden onset of hearing loss and vertigo from rupture of the round or oval window into the vestibule that results in the creation of a fistula. An abrupt change in barometric pressure (eg, decompression syndrome) also can result in a similar rupture.Menière syndrome is very uncommon in children. Symptoms consist of vertigo, fluctuating hearing loss, a sensation of pressure in the ear, and tinnitus. Recurrent episodes of vertigo and tinnitus are common, with progressive hearing loss after each event.This disorder primarily occurs in adolescents following respiratory infection. Symptoms include vertigo, nausea, and vomiting with postural instability. Episodes are self-limited but tend to recur with decreasing intensity. Diagnosis is made by electronystagmography and thermal caloric testing. Benign paroxysmal vertigo presents initially between 1 and 2 years of age, with symptoms recurring to the age of 4 years. The child presents suddenly with extreme unsteadiness and may be unable to remain upright. Nystagmus may be present, but other symptoms such as vomiting are uncommon. The child is fully conscious throughout the entire episode. Many children develop migraine later in life. The diagnosis is supported by a family history of migraine. Another migraine variant seen in infants is paroxysmal torticollis. A child who has this rare form of migraine will tilt his or her head to one side for several hours (and infrequently for up to several days). There may be associated vomiting. These episodes usually cease by 2 years of age, with many children developing typical migraine headaches by early childhood.Head trauma with or without temporal bone fracture can produce labyrinthine concussion. There is severe vertigo, with unsteadiness and falling toward the affected side. These symptoms may persist, but they gradually diminish in intensity over a 4- to 6-week period.Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo has been described in children as young as 11 years of age. The cause has been determined to be the presence of free-floating debris in the posterior semicircular canal. This type of vertigo has been related to head trauma or vestibular neuronitis. In a proportion of patients, no cause can be found. Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is provoked by a change in position and lasts for seconds. Basilar artery migraine presents primarily in adolescent girls with recurrent stereotypic attacks of brainstem and cerebellar dysfunction. The clinical features can include ataxia, dysarthria, vertigo, and tinnitus. There are variable bilateral visual complaints. Alternating hemiplegia and paresthesias of the face and limbs can occur, and there can be alteration of consciousness. A severe pounding or pulsatile headache will follow. Vertigo also may be the aura preceding a generalized seizure or present as an actual ictal phenomenon (partial complex seizure). Vestibulogenic seizures are very rare and represent a form of reflex sensory epilepsy (induced by spinning).The treatment of vertigo depends on the duration and discomfort of the symptom and the underlying pathology. Acute vertigo can be treated symptomatically and with reassurance. Antiemetics can be given rectally or intramuscularly. Vestibular sedation or suppressant medication is also useful (meclizine, dimenhydrinate, promethazine, and diazepam). Persistent severe nausea and vomiting may require administration of prochlorperazine or metoclopramide.Most children who have acute vertigo recover spontaneously over a period of several weeks to months. Symptomatic recovery is due to vestibular compensation and central plasticity (reorganization of vestibular circuits). In some children and adolescents, symptoms recur, often in association with physical or psychological stress. Medications producing vestibular sedation should not be prescribed for long-term daily use because they may interfere with the normal compensation process.A specific treatment for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo is a bedside maneuver (Epley particle repositioning maneuver). This maneuver relocates the free floating debris from the posterior semicircular canal into the vestibule of the labyrinth. Symptomatic relief after a single treatment session is reported in 80% to 90% of patients, although 15% to 30% may have recurrence of symptoms. The maneuver is repeated until nystagmus no longer can be elicited (Figure). A modified version of the Epley maneuver can be taught to patients with instructions to perform the activity three times a day until there are no symptoms of positional vertigo for 24 hours.Chronic or recurrent vertigo is often resistant to treatment, but it may respond to a course of clonazepam or carbamazepine. Exercise regimens also have been prescribed, with balance and gait training during dynamic tasks that precipitate the patient’s symptoms. These exercises are practiced until an asymptomatic state is reached. Management of accompanying psychological symptoms (eg, anxiety, panic attacks, depression) depends on the nature of the associated symptom.Surgical procedures for the treatment of vertigo rarely are required in childhood. Endolymphatic arachnoid shunt operations are successful in 65% of patients who have Menière disease. Disabling vertigo due to vestibular nerve or labyrinthine disorders may require vestibular nerve section. Surgery is an option for patients who have severe intractable benign paroxysmal positional vertigo using procedures to disable the posterior semicircular canal.Appropriate management of vertigo depends on determination of the etiology and carefully tailored treatment plans specific to the vestibular or central disorder producing the vertigo.",

      "title": "What Is Personality Disorder?",
      "abstract": "What Is Personality Disorder? Hanna Pickard (bio) The DSM-IV-TR (American Psychiatric Association 1994, 689) defines personality disorder (PD) as: A. An enduring pattern of experience and behavior that deviates markedly from the expectations of an individual’s culture. This pattern is manifested in two (or more) of the following areas: 1. Cognition (i.e., ways of perceiving and interpreting self, other people, and events); 2. Affectivity (i.e., the range, intensity, lability, and appropriateness of emotional response); 3. Interpersonal functioning; and 4. Impulse control. B. The enduring pattern is inflexible and pervasive across a broad range of personal and social situations. C. The enduring pattern leads to clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. D. The pattern is stable and of long duration, and its onset can be traced back at least to adolescence or early adulthood. E. The enduring pattern is not better accounted for as a manifestation or consequence of another mental disorder. F. The enduring pattern is not due to the direct physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or a general medical condition (e.g., head trauma). Unlike schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and other Axis I conditions, PD is not conventionally understood as an illness or disease. Rather, as the name implies, it is a disorder of the personality: an ‘enduring pattern of experience and behavior.’ Metaphorically speaking, it is a condition that is internal to the kind of person someone is, a part of who they are. It is not an external condition that befalls them. Very roughly, personality is the set of characteristics or traits that make us the kind of person we are: the ways we are inclined to think, feel, and act in response to particular circumstances, as well as more generally. All of us have one. PD occurs when the set of characteristics or traits that make a person the kind of person they are causes severe psychological distress and impairment in social, occupational, or other important contexts: the ways a person is inclined to think, feel, and act do them harm, directly or via the effects they have on relationships, work, and life more generally conceived. Diagnosis of a PD requires that these characteristics or traits be long-standing, pervasive, difficult to control or change, and markedly different from cultural expectations. Equally, the distress and impairment caused must be sufficiently extreme to warrant clinical attention: the person needs clinical care and help. Nonetheless, all of us possess characteristics or traits that sometimes incline us to think, feel, and act in ways that cause us distress and adversely affect our social, occupational, or other functioning. PD lies on a continuum with normal human personality. The broad category of PD is currently divided into three subcategories or ‘clusters.’ Cluster A comprises paranoid, schizoid, and schizotypal PD. These are more colloquially known as the odd [End Page 181] and eccentric or ‘mad’ PDs. Cluster B comprises narcissistic, borderline, histrionic, and antisocial PD. These are more colloquially known as the dramatic, emotional, and erratic or ‘bad’ PDs. Cluster C comprises obsessive-compulsive, avoidant, and dependent PD. These are more colloquially known as the anxious and fearful or ‘sad’ PDs. A person cannot be diagnosed with any particular PD unless there is clinically significant distress and impairment. But, given that this condition is met, which kind of PD they have depends on what kind of personality they have–on the nature of the problematic pattern of experience and behavior. Stepping back and considering the wider context, the picture painted of PD is bleak. PD is associated with genetic factors (Jang and Vernon 2001) and also environmental conditions (Paris 2001). These include dysfunctional families, where there is breakdown, death, institutional care, and parental psychopathology; traumatic childhood experiences, with high levels of sexual, emotional, and physical abuse or neglect; and social stressors, such as war, poverty, and migration. There are high levels of comorbidity among PDs, and between PDs and psychotic disorders, eating disorders, anxiety, depression, and substance abuse (Moran 2002). Finally, there is also a strong association between PD and violence and crime, self-harm, and suicide (Moran 2002). As this picture...",

      "abstract": "Abstract Tic disorders are chronic conditions that are frequently associated with difficulties in self-esteem, family life, social acceptance, or school or job performance that are directly related to the presence of motor and/or phonic tics. Although tic symptoms have been reported since antiquity, systematic study of individuals with tic disorders dates from the nineteenth century. In addition to tics, individuals with tic disorders may present with a broad array of behavioral difficulties including disinhibited speech or conduct, impulsivity, distractibility, motoric hyperactivity, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms (Leckman and Cohen, 1998). Alternatively, a sizable portion of children and adolescents with tics will be free of coexisting developmental or emotional difficulties. Scientific opinion has been divided on how broadly to conceive the spectrum of maladaptive behaviors associated with Tourette’s syndrome (TS) (Comings, 1988; Shapiro et al., 1988).",

      "abstract": "Until not too long ago, psychogenic trance was considered to be a 'conversion hysteria'. But clinical syndromes and personality disorders are now seen as separate entities; therefore, psychogenic trance is part of the so-called 'dissociative disorders'. Here, the integrative functions of the psyche are reduced and control of memory, identity, sensoric and motoric functions are impaired. As a consequence, certain disorders are observed, which have common characteristics, such as onset (psychogenic trauma), course (initial panic or belle indifference) and psychodynamics (repression of an unbearable reality). The following disorders can be distinguished: --psychogenic amnesia: partial or complete loss of memory --psychogenic trance: temporary loss of habitual identity with more or less full awareness of surroundings --psychogenic fugue: apparently purposeful journey away from home with psychogenic amnesia --psychogenic stupor: profound diminuation or absence of voluntary movement and no responsiveness to external stimuli.",

      "abstract": "Motion sickness occurs in a wide variety of circumstances involving real or apparent motion, many of them novel and man-made. Significantly, voluntary body movements rarely result in symptoms, and the likelihood of motion sickness is greatly reduced by having control of the vehicle in which one is riding. The unifying theory of Reason [1978] proposes that motion sickness results when there is a mismatch between predicted and actual sensory inputs. Hence, the less predictable the sensory input (because it results from an externally imposed motion, or from motion which results in errors of neural transduction), the more likely that motion sickness will develop. With continuing exposure, predictability increases and adaptation to motion sickness occurs.",

      "title": "Making sense of the role of sense organs in trichotillomania",
      "abstract": "Hallopeau, a French dermatologist, coined the term trichotillomania to describe alopecia (baldness) caused by self-traction of the hair, but the term now encompasses the entire syndrome of pathological hair pulling.[1] In Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition (DSM-5),[2] the major change for trichotillomania (hair pulling disorder) is the fact that it and related disorders now have their own chapter in the obsessive–compulsive disorder section. Trichotillomania (hair pulling disorder) includes recurrent pulling out of one's hair, resulting in hair loss, repeated attempts to decrease or stop hair pulling, and the hair pulling causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. Furthermore, the hair pulling or hair loss is not attributable to another medical condition (e.g., a dermatological condition), and the hair pulling is not better explained by the symptoms of another mental disorder (e.g., attempts to improve a perceived defect or flaw in appearance in body dysmorphic disorder). There has been lot of debates and discussion if trichotillomania is an impulse control disorder, obsessive–compulsive spectrum disorder, or should be classified as a category of body-focused repetitive behavioral disorder.[3] Trichotillomania (hair pulling disorder) has been moved to obsessive–compulsive and related disorders in DSM 5; however, in International Classification of Diseases-10, it is classified under habit and impulse control disorders.[4] Lifetime prevalence rates of trichotillomania have been estimated to vary from 0.6% to 3.6%. Trichotillomania often begins or is recognized in late childhood or early adolescence with an average age of onset around 13 years and displays a chronic but fluctuating course.[5] It involves an individual recurrently pulling hair, generally one hair at a time from any part of his/her body, the head, eyelashes, eyebrows, beard, genital area, underarms, chest, legs, or other area. The scalp is the most common area. Pulling typically is done with the fingers, but tools such as tweezers, brushes, or combs may also be used.[6] Trichotillomania is associated with a significant functional impairment and psychiatric comorbidity across the developmental spectrum. As trichotillomania usually strikes during the sensitive developmental years, it can be especially disabling. Young adults with trichotillomania report impaired school, work, and social functioning, lowered career aspirations, and missed work days. Pulling can also negatively impact family functioning, contributing to family arguments, and secrecy, which in turn can increase stress and exacerbate trichotillomania symptoms. Adults also report that spending considerable financial resources on concealment methods and on treatments.[7] POINT OF VIEW The majority of literature and definitions focus on the act of pulling the hair, the preceding tension, and the relief of anxiety following the act. A variety of factors such as a sensation of itch, boredom, mood changes, stress, and negative emotions serve as triggers to pull the hairs.[8] Pre- and post-pulling activities are documented in literature but are mentioned just as activities surrounding the hair pulling. They receive little or no attention in the whole diagnosis, understanding and management of the disorder. There are lack of satisfactory explanations provided for majority of the postpulling activities and behaviors. An article by Woods and Houghton[5] mentions \"Rituals and behavioral patterns often precede pulling, such as combing through the hair, feeling individual hairs, tugging at hairs, and visually searching the scalp and the hairline. Pre- and post-pulling behavior are also clinically relevant. Although some individuals simply discard pulled hairs, others may play with the hair between their fingers, inspect the hair, bite the hair between the teeth, or ingest all or parts of the hair\". Activities surrounding the hair pulling provide pleasure to the persons with trichotillomania which probably acts a positive reinforcement to pull the hair. The pleasure may come through various sensory modalities which may vary from person to person. If hair pulling is only the primary goal, the patients should just pull the hair one by one and throw which hardly happens. They are involved in varied activities seeking pleasure involving all the sense organs which may vary from person to person. Antecedent activities such as feeling the texture of the hair, twirling, curling, grooming, combing, desire to have an even hairline, identifying the right hair, and then, the particular hair is pulled, all involve the touch sensation. The pulled hair is actually visualized for its characteristics such as length and color which involves the visual modality. The hairs are rubbed against each other, the snap pulling sound involves the hearing modality; at times, patients do even smell the hairs mixed with sweat to experience pleasure (Olfaction). Swallowing, tasting, the whole hair or a part of the hair is widely reported in literature which may be a way of experiencing the hair or else why should a person interested in only pulling the hairs swallow it. Oral behavior using pulled hair is present in half the patients and 5%–18% ingest their hair.[9] Trichophagia is a condition where persons swallow hair. Few patients swallow only the root of the hair called trichorhizophagia. Trichobezoar is a condition wherein swallowed hair starts accumulating in the stomach over a period to form a concretion which presents later with features of malnutrition and intestinal obstruction.[10] In a study by Grant et al.,[11] the rate of trichophagia in 68 individuals with DSM-IV-TR trichotillomania was approximately 1 in 5 (20.6%). CONCLUSION All the sense organs are involved in the varied pre-/post-pulling activities which vary from person to person and serve to maintain the behavior by reinforcements. It is also possible that in a subset of people, the pleasure-providing behaviors are these surrounding acts and hair pulling is just the modality of fulfilling it. Our diagnostic guidelines focus only on the hair pulling act. The behaviors surrounding the hair pulling problem will further help in the psychological management and also bring new insights into this poorly understood illness.",

      "abstract": "The psychic reevocation of disturbance of the colon or disturbances of other body districts not felt by the patient at the time facilitates the accentuation of colon motility or tone, leading to the exacerbation of the pathogenetic premises of the disturbances complained of. The colonmetrographic findings are instructive in this respect. Direct functional disturbance of various districts is also suggested, and the pathology of such forms in psychosomatically oriented patients is described. Such orientation takes the form of a ready translation of ideas into rather diffuse somatic changes that are partly aspecific, due to the predominance of response mechanisms that are more physiological than psychological. The picture is one of a primordial reaction to difficulties and problems, coupled with increased stress, sometimes to the points of vegetative or motor storms, in the expectation of help from outside, such help being represented in the past by intervention on the part of the mother.",

Psychological factors are decisive, and they usually include a major anxiety generated by intrapsychic conflicts, which are converted by unconscious defense mechanism into symptoms. The symptoms are not intentionally provoked or simulated nor are explained by organic suffering or substance consumption. They affect the quality of life of the person who presents significant deficits such as motor, sensory, convulsive or mixed. It may also occur a lack of coordination, ataxia, paralysis, tremor, aphonia, difficulties at swallowing, loss of sensitivity, anesthesia that does not follow anatomical nervous trajectories, blindness or mental deafness. Consciousness is not altered, but a condition of \"la belle indifference\" appears which is rather associated with histrionic personality disorders and what the patients imagine about their own illness or suffering. This condition is unstable and changing. The primary gain is the expression of an unconscious psychological conflict through a somatic symptom by reducing anxiety and keeping conflict out of consciousness. The secondary gain is external and includes attention and care from caregivers or others.",

Cerebral palsy affects two to three children per 1,000 live-born. Typological characteristics of the clinical image of cerebral palsy are the modified muscle tone characterized by muscular tension, altered body posture and disturbed motion. Cerebral palsy is a disorder of the central nervous system, so it affects the whole development and functioning of the physical psychomotor development of a child. It is accompanied by developmental disorders, sensomotor disorders, perceptual cognitive developmental disorders, socioemocional disorders and difficulties in functioning of everyday life, auditory - visual and other perceptual disorders, intellectual deficit, etc., and may be accompanied by epilepsy. Cerebral palsy, although a permanetn diagnosys, depending on the degree of damage, can be treated using different treatment methods and therapies such as kinesitherapy can which can significantly influence the overall functioning of the affected person. The key precondition is early detection and propercorrective and therapeutic or curative action. Kinesitheraphy as a motion treatment method can have a significant effect on treating a person, raising the body's psychomotor status and the quality of everyday life. Methods used, based on clinical kinesiology, and appropriate exercise and modification, kinesitherapy has positive effects in treating the condition of people with cerebral palsy",

      "abstract": "IntroductionSelf-injurious behaviour (SIB), repetitive intentional hurting, bruising, cutting, burning, selfpoisoning etc. with the intent to cause pain and tissue damage, is observed as comorbid condition in various psychiatric disorders.SIB is frequently but not exclusively encountered in patients with borderline personality, posttraumatic stress, and eating disorders, but it may also occur in otherwise \"healthy\" persons, and it may be \"learned\" from peers, especially in the hospital environment (Ohmann et al., 2008).SIB aims at instantaneously reducing inner tensions resulting from anxiety, depression, stress, self-discontentedness etc., at (re)gaining self-control and escaping from numbness and dissociative states, it may serve to fulfil wishes for self-punishment, and there may (rarely) be appellative aspects alerting other people about ones poor psychical state (Favaro & Santonastaso, 1999).SIB is socially not well accepted and must be differentiated from occasional or psychotic self-mutilation and socially accepted habits like piercing and tattooing.SIB does not necessarily imply death wishes (Simeon et al., 1995) and has clearly to be differentiated from (attempted) suicide or parasuicidal gestures (Eberly, 2005).The relationship between SIB and suicidal behaviour is, however, complex.Depending on the motivational background, Favaro & Santonastaso (1998, 2000) differentiated two dimensions, impulsive and compulsive, of non-suicidal self-injury (NSSI).Depending on the characteristics of the action, Favazza & Simeon (1995) also distinguished between compulsive (hair pulling, nail biting, skin picking, scratching) and impulsive SIB (skin cutting, hitting and burning).Impulsive SIB occurs episodically, is positively connoted, and patients exhibit only little resistance towards their ego-syntonic impulses.Compulsive SIB is habitual, occurs repetitively, and patients exhibit some resistance towards their ego-dystonic urges.Compulsive SIB shares commonalities with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).Patients with eating disorders (EDs) often present with a combination of obsessivecompulsive and impulsive symptoms (Lacey & Evans, 1986).Considering the effects, extreme starving, repeated vomiting, purging etc. can also be considered as SIB (van der Kolk et al., 1991;Ahrén-Moonga et al., 2008).In the study of Laye-Gindhu & Schonert-Reichl (2005), adolescents considered their eating-disordered behaviour as self-harm.SIB in patients with EDs tends to be more repetitive, and characterized by little suicidal intent.Some patients exhibit direct (e.g., skin cutting), some indirect self-aggressive www.intechopen.comRelevant Topics in Eating Disorders 134 behaviour (e.g., severe alcohol abuse) (Favaro & Santonastaso, 2002).SIB in ED patients may be considered as an indicator of psychopathological severity (Newton et al., 1993;Claes et al., 2003), especially if it is related to the frequency or severity of SIB (Claes et al., 2003).Although suicide is not a primary aim, persons engaged in SIB exhibit a greater risk for suicide-related behaviour in clinical populations (Whitlock et al., 2006, Brunner et al., 2007).SIB is a risk factor for suicide: patients with SIB describe more suicidal ideation and past suicide attempts (Dulit et al., 1994).Persons who later committed or attempted suicide often present with a history of SIB (Hawton, 2005;Hawton et al., 1993;Hawton et al., 1999).Adolescents with suicidal ideation have a 18-fold risk of being engaged in repetitive SIB and a 2-fold increased risk of occasional SIB.Among the various subgroups of SIB, most of them do not imply a high suicidal risk and may be classified as \"non-suicidal\", but suicide may never be excluded.Therefore adolescents presenting with SIB must always carefully be evaluated for suicidality (Greydanus & Shek, 2009).As concerns SIB and suicide in patients with EDs, BN is more frequently related to suicide attempts (Favaro & Santonastaso, 1996).Patients with EDs who purge and those with comorbid affective, substance use, and cluster B personality disorders (PDs) report more frequently about suicide attempts (Favaro &",

Core features include abnormal movement and posture due to impairments in coordination and/or muscle tone. CP is not an etiologic diagnosis. Rather, it is a descriptive term based on an individual's clinical picture. Among children diagnosed with CP, there is great heterogeneity with respect to etiology, type of impairment, and severity of impairment. Brain disturbances that lead to CP may occur prenatally, perinatally, or in the young child during brain development and maturation. Although the brain disturbances leading to CP are not progressive, the clinical picture is not static. Clinical features of CP evolve with time, development, learning, motor training, and therapy. The disorder can potentially lead to poor growth of a limb, contractures and poor range of motion, pain secondary to spasticity, inability to complete voluntary movements, neglect of a limb, inability to complete activities of daily living, and poor participation in the community.",

The wide variety of seemingly unrelated independent stereotypies generated by central stimulants is also puzzling. In rodents, for instance, drugs such as apomorphine and amphetamine have been reported to elicit climbing, jumping, rearing, prancing, running, walking, circling, revolving, pivoting, gnawing, licking, nose-poking, sniffing, verticalization, side-to-side head and paw movements, backward locomotion, and underwater swimming without surfacing (e.g. Alander etal.1983; Cole 1977; Costall and Naylor 1973; Decsi et al.1979; Fray et al.1980; Janssen et al.1960; Jerussi and Glick 1976; Kokkinidis and Anisman 1979; Schijljrring 1971; Schoenfeld et al.1975; Segal et al.1980; Szechtman et al.1982; Teitelbaum 1986; Thomas and Handley 1978; Voigtlander eta/.1975).

We report its occurrence in hyperthyroidism, with which choreoathetosis has rarely been described in the past without known cause. Choreoathetosis has also occurred with other metabolic and toxic disorders, and the mechanism is uncertain. The development of involuntary movements activated by limb motion during hyperthyroidism suggests an influence by thyroid hormone or metabolic state on motor neurone excitability or motor system organization.",

      "abstract": "The term \"brain paralysis\" refers to cerebral palsy. It is a disability that impairs movement and posture. The general term \"cerebral palsy,\" sometimes known as \"CP,\" refers to a loss or impairment of motor function brought on by brain injury. The brain injury or aberrant brain growth that takes place before, during, or right after a child's birth results in brain damage. Body movement, muscular control, coordination, tone, reflex, posture, and balance are all impacted by cerebral palsy. Only a portion of the brain is hurt, primarily the areas that regulate movement. Once injured, brain tissue does not regenerate or worsen. However, depending on how a doctor treats the child and how much brain damage there is, the motions, body positions, and associated issues may get better or worse. A brain injury that results in a permanent, non-progressive, and occasionally growing disturbance of tone, movement, or posture is known as cerebral palsy. With 2-3 newborns per 1000 live births affected, it is the most widespread chronic motor impairment in children. William John Little was the first to characterise it, stating that \"cerebral palsy is a disease of motor control caused to a static lesion of the developing brain.\" Key words: Panchakarma, Ayurveda, Cerebral Palsy, Basti, Swedan, Nasya",

Relatively common after unilateral lesions are anosognosia and anosodiaphoria—that is, the denial of, or unconcern about, a sensorimotor hemisyndrome.

The term misoplegia was coined by Critchley1,2 and refers to the morbid dislike or hatred of paralysed limbs in patients with hemiplegia. Minor manifestations of this condition may be restricted to verbal aggression towards a limb, but commonly misoplegia includes physical acts such as striking and beating the hemiplegic extremity.1–3 Although these verbal or physical acts of self-directed aggression are impressive, detailed case reports are rare.

      "title": "Nonfebrile Seizures",
      "abstract": "Nonfebrile seizures occur in children of all ages and often pose a challenge to the pediatrician in terms of cause, management, and prognosis. The term “seizure” does not imply a diagnosis, but rather indicates a clinical event that reflects a time-related dysfunction of the central nervous system (CNS) and may signal a serious underlying abnormality;however, more often in children the term indicates a transient disturbance of brain function. The pediatrician’s role is to determine the cause of the seizure and to treat the condition, based on an understanding of its pathogenesis, impact on the child and family, and the long-term outlook of the condition.Seizures and epilepsy are not synonymous. A seizure(convulsion) is defined as a paroxysmal involuntary discharge of cortical neurons that may be manifested clinically by an impairment or loss of consciousness, abnormal motor activity, behavioral and emotional abnormalities, sensory disturbances, or autonomic dysfunction. Some seizures are characterized by abnormal movements without loss of consciousness. The term epilepsy refers to spontaneous recurrent seizures unrelated to fever. In other words, a patient who has a single nonfebrile seizure that does not recur over time would not merit the diagnosis of epilepsy. The ages of greatest risk for nonfebrile seizures are during infancy, childhood, and adolescence. The annual incidence rate from birth to 20 years of age is 0.56 per 1000; the cumulative risk of epilepsy during the first 2 decades of life is approximately 1%. The prevalence of epilepsy in the pediatric population is 4 to 6 cases per 1000 children.Some may ask why it is necessary to classify epilepsy if the treatment and prognosis are similar for all children. There are primarily two forms of epilepsy characterized by either generalized seizures or a focal onset, and generalized and focal seizures respond predictably to some classes of anticonvulsants and not to others. The clinical appearance of a seizure may not indicate clearly whether the origin of the epileptiform discharge is focal or generalized. For example, a child may present with repetitive episodes of staring and unresponsiveness. Is this a generalized absence or a complex partial seizure? The proper classification will dictate the appropriate anticonvulsant. Finally, accurate classification of epilepsy permits the pediatrician to discuss the prognosis of the condition with the child and family. Most likely the child who has absence epilepsy will become seizure-free and not require medication as a teenager; focal seizures do not have the same favorable outcome.The International Classification of Epileptic Seizures (ICES) was introduced in 1981 and is based primarily on the clinical description of the seizure and the associated changes on electroencephalogram (EEG). The majority of seizures can be classified according to the ICES nomenclature (Table 1). Simple partial seizures (SPS) are associated most commonly with asynchronous clonic or tonic motor movements such as forced deviation of the head and eyes to one side. An SPS typically is short-lived,rarely persisting longer than 10 to 20 seconds, and the child remains conscious and is able to verbalize throughout it. The EEG characteristically shows unilateral spikes or sharp waves in the anterior temporal region, but the discharges may be bilateral;occasionally a multifocal spike pattern is recorded.Complex partial seizures (CPS) initially may share the characteristic appearance of an SPS with or without an aura, followed by impairment of consciousness. Alternatively, CPS may begin with loss of consciousness. The average duration of a CPS is 1 to 2 minutes, which is significantly longer than an SPS or an absence seizure. Aura is common and signals the onset of a seizure in approximately 30% of children who have CPS,with the child complaining of epigastric discomfort, fear, or an unpleasant discharge may spread from a temporal lobe throughout the cortex, causing a generalized tonic-clonic convulsion (termed secondary generalization). The majority of children who have CPS have an abnormal EEG characterized by sharp waves or spike discharges in the anterior temporal or frontal lobe or by multifocal spikes. Partial seizures are the most common form of epilepsy in children.Simple (petit mal) absence seizures typically have their onset at 5 to 6 years of age and are characterized by brief (5 to 20 sec) lapses in consciousness, speech, or motor activity,sometimes associated with flickering of the eyelids. Absence seizures never are accompanied by an aura or a postictal period of drowsiness, but automatisms may be observed during the seizure. The automatisms usually consist of eye blinking or lip smacking. Hyperventilation for 3 to 4 minutes by the cooperative patient frequently induces a seizure. The EEG is characterized by 3 per second generalized spike and wave discharges that indicate a clinical seizure. In contrast, an atypical absence seizure is characterized by associated myoclonic movements of the face and body,sometimes leading to loss of body tone, which causes the child to fall. The EEG pattern commonly is associated with either 2 to 2.5 per second or 3.5 to 4.5 per second generalized spike and wave discharges.Myoclonic seizures may occur in isolation or in association with other types of epilepsy, including tonic-clonic convulsions. Myoclonic seizures are characterized by brief, often repetitive symmetric muscle contractions with loss of normal body tone. Atonic seizures are difficult to differentiate from myoclonic seizures; in many cases they represent a prolonged myoclonic seizure. Atonic seizures typically cause the child to fall because of the sudden loss of postural tone.Primary generalized tonic-clonic (formerly called grand mal) and tonic or clonic seizures are well known to most pediatricians. These seizures are characterized by sudden loss of consciousness and tonic-clonic, tonic, or clonic contractions. Tonic seizures are associated with intense muscle contraction and clonic seizures with rhythmic, usually symmetric jerking movements. The child may develop perioral cyanosis and lose bladder control. The seizure is followed by a 30 to 60 minute period of deep sleep and postictal headache.The major disadvantage of the ICES classification is its failure to recognize certain distinct epileptic syndromes that are age-related, are characterized by specific types of seizures, and have varying etiologies that differ significantly from causes of epilepsy in the adult patient population. A“syndromic” classification proposed in 1989 by the International League Against Epilepsy permits selection of an anticonvulsant that is most appropriate to treat the patient’s predominant seizure type. The primary drawback of this more sophisticated approach to diagnosis and treatment of a child’s epileptic syndrome is that at present, only approximately 50% of seizure disorders in children can be placed into a specific syndrome. For the purpose of this review, the clinical description,characteristic EEG patterns, treatment, and prognosis of five epileptic syndromes are outlined briefly in Table 2. These syndromes include infantile spasms, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, Landau-Kleffner syndrome, benign childhood epi- lepsy with centrotemporal (rolandic) spikes, and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (Janz syndrome).Despite the advent of molecular diagnosis and new neuroimaging techniques, the etiology of most seizures in children remains unknown. The acute onset of seizures may result from cerebral trauma(head injury), CNS infection (meningitis, encephalitis), cerebrovascular diseases (infarction, arteriovenous malformation, hemorrhage, venous thrombosis), toxins (lead), brain tumor (cerebral or extracerebral),specific epilepsy syndromes (Table 2), genetic/heredi-tary diseases (eg, Down syndrome, tuberous sclerosis), metabolic and systemic diseases (endocrine, renal), degenerative disorders (leukodystrophy), or hereditary malformations (eg, cortical dysplasia, lissencephaly).An increasing number of epilepsy syndromes have been identified that are the result of a genetic abnormality. To date, the chromosomal loci have been identified for seven epilepsy genes and three epilepsy syndromes, including benign familial neonatal convulsions (chromosomes 20q and 8q), fatal progressive myoclonic epilepsy or Unverricht-Lundborg disease (chromosome 21q), and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (chromosome 6p). The gene locus on chromosome 6 also may be responsible for other types of generalize tonic-clonic seizures. Studies of large numbers of families that have other well-defined epilepsy syndromes likely will uncover additional epilepsy genes.The age of presentation often provides a clue to the possible cause of epilepsy. Hypoxic-ischemic encepha-lopathy is the most common cause of seizures in the newborn, which characteristically are apparent within the first 24 hours. Children who have neonatal seizures following a hypoxic-ischemic insult are at significant risk to continue to have seizures (ie, epilepsy). Pyridoxine dependency may be the cause of seizures that begin shortly after birth, especially if they are associated with signs of fetal distress and particularly when there is a history of seizures in utero. Metabolic encephalopathies typically are associated with seizures in the newborn and usually are unresponsive to conventional anticonvulsants. The infant who has a urea cycle abnormality or a disorder of amino acid metabolism such as nonketotic hyperglycinemia may appear normal at birth, but within a few days will lose interest in feeding and sucking, followed by lethargy proceeding to coma and seizures, which often are of the myoclonic variety. Disorders of mitochondria, such as Leigh disease and pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency,often present during infancy with repetitive seizures. The anoxic and metabolic encephalopathies that are associated with seizures will not be discussed further; several excellent reviews are included in the reading list.With the advent of modern imaging technology, including magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), single photon emission computed tomography(SPECT), and positron emission tomography (PET), it has become evident that structural abnormalities of the brain and congenital disorders of neuronal migration play an important role in the causation of epilepsy. The migrational abnormality may be severe and generalized, as seen in the child who has lissencephaly, which is characterized by a smooth brain due to a lack of gyri and a structure equivalent to a 12-week fetus. On the other hand, discrete collections of aberrant neurons visible by MRI imaging may be the cause of focal epilepsy in an otherwise normal child. A small number of children who have generalized infantile spasms have been found by EEG, MRI,SPECT, and PET scanning to have focal nests of dislocated neurons. In these cases, surgical excision of the abnormal cortex may result in complete seizure control.There is strong evidence that simple febrile seizures are not a cause of epilepsy, but whether a prolonged febrile seizure, especially during infancy,may cause mesial temporal sclerosis, thereby producing epilepsy at a later age, is still controversial. The cause of epilepsy in a cognitively and neurologically normal child has not been well defined; additional studies in these children may uncover a genetic basis.A presumptive diagnosis of epilepsy generally is made from a history of spontaneous recurrent seizures and findings on the physical examination because it is unlikely that the child will have a seizure in the presence of the physician. In response to careful questioning, the parent usually can give a good account of the seizure and whether it is generalized or focal in onset. The child also should participate in history taking because the existence of aura, which signifies a focal onset, may not be known to the parents. Certain seizures, such as absence or pseudoseizures, may be provoked in the clinical setting by hyperventilation or the power of suggestion. If the history and description of seizures remain unclear, the parent can videotape seizures for later review by the pediatrician. Generally, if a diagnosis of epilepsy is in doubt following the examination and an EEG, it is in the child's best interest to watch and wait before initiating specific treatment. It is possible that a condition mimicking epilepsy will become apparent during the period of observation.A number of paroxysmal nonepileptic disorders share features with epilepsy and, therefore, may be misdiagnosed by the physician. None of these conditions responds to anticonvulsant drugs. Breath-holding spells are such an example. Unlike epilepsy, breath-holding spells always are provoked and stereotyped and often are predictable. The child is frightened or chastised or falls and bumps his or her head, which is followed immediately by a brief shrill cry, forced expiration, and sudden loss of consciousness. The child becomes cyanotic(occasionally pallid) and during the succeeding 30 to 60 seconds may have several generalized tonic-clonic movements before consciousness returns. The child is lethargic and sleepy for a brief period following the event. Gastroesophageal reflux may cause laryngospasm, bradycardia, and apneic episodes in an infant, which may be confused with a seizure disorder. Prompt management of the reflux usually brings the apnea under control.Benign paroxysmal vertigo(BPV) often is confused with epilepsy. BPV causes the normal toddler to stagger or fall suddenly and to become pale and frightened. Some children will vomit during the episode, and all children will become dysarthric and complain of vertigo if they are able to verbalize. About 25% of children will have nystagmus during the attack. Although episodes of BPV usually are brief, persisting for 1 to 2 minutes, they may recur repetitively throughout the day.Simple syncope (fainting) is common in the adolescent and adult but is unusual in a child younger than 10 years of age. Tilt-table testing is a useful method to distinguish simple syncope from a seizure when the diagnosis is uncertain.Two types of syncope or loss of consciousness that begin during childhood may be confused with epilepsy and pose a significant hazard to the child. Cough syncope often is associated with poorly controlled asthma. These children develop cough paroxysms a few hours after falling asleep. The paroxysms may be so prolonged and persistent that the child loses consciousness and control of the bladder sphincter. There often are generalized tonic-clonic movements during the period of unconsciousness. The child has no recollection of these events the following morning. The prolonged QT syndrome results from an abnormality of myocardial function due to a familial or acquired insult, which may result in ventricular arrhythmias leading to sudden death. Children who have the prolonged QT syndrome are especially prone to cardiac arrhythmias during exercise or periods of anxiety or fear. It is vital not to confuse this condition with simple syncope or epilepsy because genetic counseling, teaching the parents cardiopulmonary resuscitation, or introducing specific drug therapy aimed at preventing the arrhythmia (eg, beta blockers) may be life-saving.Night terrors are common,especially in boys 4 to 6 years of age,and sometimes may be confused with epilepsy. They typically develop during the early stages of sleep and are characterized by the sudden onset of crying or screaming,uncontrollable flailing of the extremities, unintelligible speech, dilated pupils, and drooling. A few minutes later the child returns to sleep and has no recollection of the event.The episodic dyscontrol syndrome (rage attacks) is a behavioral disorder observed primarily in boys ages 6 to 12 years. The rage attack always is provoked by a confrontation with a student, friend, or more likely a parent, usually the mother. Following the precipitating event,the child simply loses control,lashing out at the parent; scratching,biting, or physically injuring the person; and sometimes threatening the individual with a knife or weapon. There usually is profanity and verbal threats, but no loss of consciousness. At the conclusion of the episode, the child usually is remorseful. In my experience, the largest number of referrals are initiated by child psychiatrists who wish to exclude CPS as a possible etiology for the severe behavioral outbursts observed in these children.Masturbation may mimic a seizure disorder. This behavior is seen most frequently in 2- to 4-year-old girls. In the recumbent position, the child develops repetitive rhythmic copulatory movements accompanied by a staring appearance, perspiration,plethoric facies, and unresponsiveness to the parents’ or siblings’voices.Tics are involuntary, spasmodic,nonrhythmic, repetitive movements. Unlike seizures, tics are stereotypic movements, unassociated with impaired consciousness; at times they may be suppressed by the patient.Pseudoseizures commonly are misdiagnosed as epilepsy; at the time of referral, patients typically are receiving three or four anticonvulsants with poor seizure control. Pseudoseizures develop most often during the preadolescent or adolescent periods in patients who have a previous history of epilepsy. The seizures may seem very realistic but often are bizarre and characterized by peculiar extremity postures,frequent falling without injury, and various vocal utterances. A pseudoseizure rarely persists longer than 5 minutes, and tongue biting or perioral cyanosis are uncommon. Frequently the recovery is sudden compared with the typical postictal period associated with a generalized tonic-clonic seizure. Pseudoseizures rarely occur when the child is unattended and lack the typical neurologic findings observed during a seizure, such as unresponsive dilated pupils and extensor plantar responses. The eyelids may be closed firmly, and the patient resists eye opening by the examiner during a pseudoseizure. Because a significant number of children who have pseudoseizures also have epilepsy,the presence of epilepsy does not exclude the diagnosis. A useful rule of thumb is that urinary or fecal incontinence during the ictal event excludes the diagnosis of pseudoseizures. Adolescent girls subjected to incest or sexual abuse may present with pseudoseizures. The pediatrician must consider initiating a comprehensive evaluation to exclude sexual abuse for all adolescent girls who have pseudoseizures.The EEG is a useful adjunct to the history and physical examination in establishing the diagnosis of epilepsy, but a routine interictal(between seizures) EEG will show an epileptiform abnormality in only approximately 60% of patients. EEG abnormalities are more likely to be recorded in the infant or child who has epilepsy than in the adolescent or adult who has epilepsy. Various procedures are employed during the EEG in an attempt to activate a seizure discharge in a child suspected of having epilepsy, including eye closure, hyperventilation, photic stimulation, and in specific circumstances, sleep deprivation and special electrode placement (eg,zygomatic leads). Prolonged EEG monitoring with simultaneous closed-circuit video recording is used in specific circumstances. For example, prolonged recording is useful for identifying ictal seizures that rarely are captured during routine EEG testing. Furthermore,prolonged EEG recording is particularly helpful in determining the location and frequency of seizure discharges while simultaneously visualizing and recording changes in levels of consciousness and the presence of clinical signs, which is critical for proper classification of the seizure disorder. Detailed localization and frequency of the seizure focus is essential for choosing appropriate candidates for epilepsy surgery. Finally, prolonged EEG recording is the “gold standard” test for investigating a patient who has suspected pseudoseizures.Unfortunately, the routine EEG often is not used appropriately. It cannot be used reliably to determine the appropriate duration of anticonvulsant therapy or to explain a lack of response to therapy. The EEG does provide essential information in at least four situations: to support a clinical diagnosis by typical EEG changes during the recording(eg, benign childhood epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes or absence epilepsy); to differentiate seizure disorders with similar clinical characteristics (eg, absence versus CPS); to detect potential structural brain lesions (focal slow-wave abnormalities); and to identify patients who have pseudoseizures.Computed tomography (CT) is of little use in the evaluation of a child who has epilepsy, except in special circumstances such as investigation of a child suspected of having congenital Cytomegalovirus infection characterized by periventricular calcifications or tuberous sclerosis typified by calcified tubers in the subependymal layer. CT studies of children who have epilepsy have shown an abnormality in approximately 30% of cases, consisting primarily of cortical atrophy or dilated ventricles; this provides little useful information for clinical management.MRI is gaining increasing importance in the study of children who have epilepsy, especially in examination of temporal lobe and hippocampal atrophy and sclerosis in patients resistant to anticonvulsant therapy. The use of MRI should be reserved for investigating all children who present with complex partial seizures, those who have a focal neurologic deficit (either static or postictal), those who present with complex seizures of increasing frequency or severity regardless of type, and all adolescents who have a first seizureThe initial step in the management of a child who is suspected of having epilepsy is to ensure that the paroxysmal event was, in fact, a seizure. A thorough history and examination coupled with appropriate studies and observation should distinguish nonepileptic events from seizures, as discussed previously.Whether anticonvulsant medication should be prescribed for the child who has a first nonfebrile seizure depends on the seizure type. The risk of recurrence following absence(typical or atypical) seizures,myoclonic seizures, and infantile spasms is certain; thus,anticonvulsants are initiated at the outset. A child who has a single afebrile tonic-clonic seizure, particularly if it occurs on awakening, has a good prognosis; 75% will not experience a second convulsion if the neurologic examination and EEG are normal and there is no family history of epilepsy. Anticonvulsants are not advised following the initial seizure in these children.However, when two or more unprovoked afebrile seizures occur within a 6- to 12-month time frame,anticonvulsants usually are indicated. Fasting blood glucose and serum calcium levels are indicated prior to the initiation of anticonvulsant therapy if the history suggests hypoglycemia or hypocalcemia as a cause of the seizure.Following the decision to treat with an anticonvulsant, the choice of drug depends on the seizure type or specific epileptic syndrome, as well as the efficacy and toxicity of the agent. The therapeutic goal is to treat with a single anticonvulsant that is most likely to control seizures completely with little or no adverse effects. Unfortunately, it is difficult to achieve these objectives in many cases. Table 3summarizes the choice of drugs used in specific seizure types, the dose, the range of therapeutic serum levels, and the potential side effects and toxicity for each anticonvulsant.The amount of attention that should be given to the standard therapeutic ranges of anticonvulsants in the management of childhood epilepsy is very controversial (see Table 3). Some children achieve seizure control with subtherapeutic serum drug levels (eg, carbamazepine); for others, the seizures do not come under control until serum drug levels above the published range are reached (eg, valproic acid). Thus, if standard therapeutic serum levels are used as the only benchmark,children will be overtreated or undertreated routinely. There are specific periods when therapeutic drug monitoring is indicated: 1) At the initiation of therapy to ensure that the therapeutic range is achieved, 2)During times of accelerated growth, and 3) If the seizures are out of control or the child is toxic. In general, the patient’s response to treatment is more important than the serum concentration of the drug.I also recommend routine drug monitoring in the following clinical situations: 1) Children who undergo a change in seizure type; 2) Patients who continue to have seizures in spite of an adequate drug dose based on weight and age; 3) Patients who have hepatic or renal disease;4) Children treated with phenytoin;5) Patients receiving multiple drugs(polytherapy), especially valproic acid, lamotrigine, and phenobarbital,because drug interactions are common; 6) Children who have mental and physical handicaps in whom drug toxicity may be difficult to evaluate; and 7) Patients and families who are noncompliant with the drug regimen.Adverse reactions to anticonvulsant drugs are common and on rare occasion may be life-threatening. Most serious adverse reactions occur during the initial 1 to 3 months of therapy and are more prominent when specific risks are present. For example, severe hepatotoxicity in association with valproic acid therapy is more likely to occur in the developmentally delayed or neurologically abnormal child younger than 2 years of age who is being treated with multiple anticonvulsants. The risk is even greater if the infant has an underlying metabolic disorder, particularly involving mitochondrial function. If the cause of the child’s seizure disorder is unknown, screening for a metabolic disorder (eg, blood gases, serum lactate and pyruvate, carnitine,ammonia, amino acids, and urinary organic acids) should be under-taken prior to the introduction of valproic acid.Routine screening with liver function tests and a complete blood count does not necessarily select patients destined to develop a serious adverse drug reaction such as aplastic anemia, hepatotoxicity, or Stevens-Johnson syndrome. In many cases the drug complication becomes apparent clinically prior to changes in blood test results. Thus,careful clinical monitoring of the patient, especially during the initial phase of treatment, is mandatory to identify early adverse reactions.Anticonvulsants may induce or inhibit enzyme production or they may displace another anticonvulsant from a shared plasma protein-binding site. Several anticonvulsants are capable of enzyme induction,including carbamazepine, primidone,phenytoin, and phenobarbital. When these drugs are used together, they may lower the plasma levels of each other by increasing the rate of metabolism. Conversely, enzyme inhibition tends to increase plasma levels by decreasing the rate of metabolism. An important example of this phenomenon is the potential for carbamazepine toxicity when erythromycin also is prescribed. Erythromycin inhibits microsomal enzyme systems, which results in decreased clearance of carbamazepine. Phenytoin and phenobarbital may be displaced from plasma protein-binding sites by valproic acid, which may lead to toxic serum levels that can be adjusted by lowering the dose of valproic acid. Valproic acid also reduces the plasma clearance and prolongs the half-life of lamotrigine. It is not known whether this interaction explains the increased incidence of severe skin rashes and Stevens-Johnson syndrome when valproic acid and lamotrigine are used simultaneously.Each anticonvulsant drug can cause unwanted behavioral and cognitive side effects in children. What often is not appreciated is that up to 30% of untreated children who have epilepsy experience behavioral problems, perhaps in part as a psychological reaction to the chronic condition or to dysfunction of the CNS. Furthermore, intellectual impairment has been well-described in children who have epilepsy. It often is difficult to determine whether behavior changes or poor academic performance by a child who has epilepsy is the result of the medication, the underlying seizure disorder, or both. Often the behavioral or performance problems are subtle,and they are recognized by parents or the teacher only after discontinuation of the anticonvulsant.Phenobarbital causes behavioral side effects in up to 50% of children, including personality change, irritability, fitful sleep,hyperactivity, short attention span, and depression. Many of the unwanted symptoms become less apparent when the dose is decreased. Because of the high frequency of side effects associated with phenobarbital, this agent no longer is the drug of choice in the treatment of childhood epilepsy. In decreasing frequency, the following drugs also may cause similar behavioral problems—ACTH, benzodiazepines, carbamazepine, phenytoin, and primidone. Valproic acid is the least likely to affect a child’s behavior adversely. Valproic acid also has little untoward influence on a child’s cognitive performance, although any anticonvulsant may produce unwanted behavioral side effects.If the child develops an adverse behavioral change following initiation of anticonvulsant therapy, theppediatrician has several options, including lowering the dose or if the problem persists,substituting another anticonvulsant for the offending drug. This situation also affords an opportunity to reassess the need for an antiepileptic drug. Follow-up should include an assessment of the child’s behavior and school performance on every visit. If academic or behavioral problems continue after drug readjustment or substitution, the child must be referred for a comprehensive evaluation to assess learning and cognitive parameters; plans also must be established for appropriate remediation.If a child’s seizures are completely controlled for a period of approximately 2 years, consideration should be given to weaning from the anticonvulsant, particularly if the child has no risk factors for seizures.The most prominent risk factors associated with recurrence of seizures include developmental delay or motor handicap, age greater than 12 years at seizure onset, neonatal seizures, and multiple seizures before control is attained. Absence and generalized tonic-clonic seizures on awakening tend to have a better outcome following drug withdrawal than partial complex seizures with secondary generalization. Agreement is not uniform as to the predictability of EEG abnormalities and seizure recurrence, whether at the onset of therapy or during follow-up. There is mounting evidence, however,that paroxysmal EEG features (eg, spike and wave) are a contraindication to withdrawing anticonvulsants. If the child has several risk factors, a trial with monotherapy (if the child is receiving several drugs) following 2 years of complete seizure control is suggested.The weaning process should be supervised closely and occur over a period of 4 to 6 months. If the child is receiving polytherapy, one drug should be removed at a time; the entire weaning period will be extended compared with that of a child receiving monotheraphy. Of those children who are seizure-free for 2 years and who have no risk factors, 70% to 75% will remain seizure-free without anticonvulsants. The most vulnerable time for seizure recurrence is the initial 6 months following drug withdrawal. If seizures recur, the child once again is placed on the drug that initially provided seizure control for at least 2 years. If the seizures reappear following a second drug withdrawal,life-long anticonvulsant theraphy may be required.The ketogenic diet was used frequently for the treatment of intractable epilepsy before the discovery of the newer antiepileptics—carbamazepine, the benzodiazepines,and vallproic acid. Interest has been renewed in this high-fat diet by television shows and videotapes sponsored by parent groups. The mode of action is unknown, but seizure control may be correlated directly with elevated levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate and acetoacetate that result from ketosis. Children who have complex myoclonic epilepsy associated with tonic-clonic convulsions are most likely to respond to the diet. For those who do respond, it often is possible to decrease or discontinue most, if not all, anticonvulsants, so that the child inevitably becomes brighter and more responsive. The use of valproic acid is contraindicated in conjunction with the ketogenic diet because the latter potentiates the hepatotoxicity of the former. The ketogenic diet may be appropriate for the child who has recalcitrant seizures despited polytheraphy, in whom an underlying cause of the seizure is unknown. Because the diet is unpalatable and has a high fat content, some children beyond the age of 1 to 2 years will not tolerate it. The ketogenic diet usually is continued for a period of 2 years in children who have good seizure control.Surgery is gaining increasing popularity as a method of treatment children who have focal seizures unresponsive to anticonvulsant therapy. The assessment of children for possible surgery must be conducted in a tertiary center by a skilled pediatric epileptologist in a multidisciplinary setting. Following routing EEGs,prolonged EEG recording with video monitoring is imperative to localize the site(s) and identify the frequency of epileptogenic discharges. Many centers use subdural electrodes to define the extent of the epileptogenic activity more accurately. These studies often are accomplished by decreasing or discontinuing the anticonvulsant drugs to promote frequent seizures, which increases the reliability of locating the seizure focus.In addition to the EEG studies,the child undergoes a series of other proceduresto assist in localization of the seizure focus and identification of the dominant cerebral hemisphere, including neuropsychologic evaluation, the Wada test (intracarotid injection of amobarbital),SPECT, PET in some centers, and MRI studies. These studies may identify a lesion corresponding to the focal seizure abnormality,including a low-grade glioma,hamartoma, or evidence of mesial temporal sclerosis. The results of epilepsy surgery in children who have a localized area of epileptogenic activity associated with a structural lesion is excellent. Temporal lobe resection is the most common surgery performed in children and adults; corpus callosotomy,hemispherectomy, and nontemporal lobe resections are more common in the younger child who has intractable seizures. Further development of electrophysiologic monitoring and advances in neurosurgery will allow more children who have focal seizures unresponsive to anticonvulsant therapy to benefit from epilepsy surgery.Appropriate and timely counseling of the parents and child is at least as important as choosing the correct anticonvulsant. Parents and patients who comprehend the purpose and side effects of anticonvulsant drugs as well as their action are much more likely to be compliant and supportive. At the time of diagnosis, the family often is overwhelmed and does not know where to start. It is useful initially to review the causes of epilepsy and explain the need for an EEG and additional studies if warranted. This consultation also provides an opportunity to dispel various myths about epilepsy.Subsequently visits should focus on factors that may exacerbate seizures,including a low-grade fever, undue stress, lack of sleep, and certain drugs such as methylphenidate and the phenotiazines. On occasion,anticonvulsants, particularly carbamazepine and phenytoin, may potentiate seizures. The physician should review first-aid measures that can be initiated at home if a seizure occurs. I recommend that the child not bathe or swim unattended because a seizure could result in drowning. However, the pediatrician should encourage participation in all activities, including contact sports if the patient desires, as long as appropriate protective equipment is used. Because adolescents who have epilepsy are primarily concerned about obtaining a driver’s license,the pediatrician should be aware of state laws governing driver’s licenses for people who have epilepsy. It is imperative that school teachers be made aware of children who have epilepsy because the children are at risk for learning disorders and require careful surveillance to identify situations in which special assistance is needed.The diagnosis of epilepsy frequently affects the family negatively. The parents are frightened that their child might die during a seizure,develop brain damage as a consequence of recurrent seizures, or have significant irreversible side effects from the anticonvulsant. Many parents feel guilty and vulnerable,particularly if there is a family history of epilepsy. If their fears and questions are not addressed adequately, a parent may tend to isolate the child,which will cause greater anxiety and family discord. The pediatrician must respond to the psychosocial needs of such a family. Most parents benefit from reading material produced by the Epilepsy Foundation of America and by participating in parent meetings sponsored by local epilepsy organizations. Time should be set aside at each follow-up visit to address concerns relating to any academic, social, or behavioral problems. As the parents become more familiar with the many facets of epilepsy, their confidence will grow and ability to cope will improve.Most children who have epilepsy are well-controlled on anticonvulsant medication with few if any side effects, have normal intelligence,and can be expected to lead normal lives. The pediatrician can play a pivotal role in ensuring that the child who has epilepsy reaches his or her highest potential.SUGGESTED RESOURCES FOR PARENTS AND CAREGIVERSFreeeman JM, Vinning EPG, Pillas DJ.

Children may present with physical manifestations of stress, such as secondary enuresis or self-harm, or strange behaviours including aggression or submissiveness. They may be referred because of developmental delay or anxiety. Recognition and management of emotional abuse is vital to prevent long-term sequelae. This may include removal of the child from the harmful environment, or structured interventions, including parent or family behavioural schemes or social care input, or psychotherapy sessions.",

      "title": "Beyond the motor impairment in dyskinetic cerebral palsy: neuropsychological and connectome-based approach",
      "abstract": "La paralisis cerebral (PC) se define como un grupo de trastornos del movimiento y/o la postura y de la funcion motora debidos a una lesion, interferencia o anomalia no progresiva en un cerebro inmaduro o en desarrollo. Estos trastornos motores a menudo se acompanan de alteraciones sensoriales, de la percepcion, de la cognicion, de la comunicacion, del comportamiento o de epilepsia, y se ha evidenciado que estos deficits pueden tener un mayor impacto sobre la calidad de vida que el propio deficit motor. Teniendo en cuenta la clasificacion de la PC segun el tipo de afectacion motora se identifica que la PC discinetica es un subtipo poco frecuente (entre el 3% y el 15% de todos los casos) que se caracteriza por patrones anormales de postura y/o movimiento, acompanados de movimientos involuntarios, descontrolados, recurrentes y, ocasionalmente, estereotipados. Este tipo de PC se ha asociado principalmente a procesos de hipoxia-isquemia en bebes nacidos a termino o casi a termino, y a la presencia de ictericia grave. Se ha evidenciado como la PC discinetica es mas incapacitante que otros tipos de PC, no solo por su asociacion con una mayor afectacion motriz sino tambien por una mayor presencia y gravedad de deficits asociados, como una mayor afectacion del habla y de la comunicacion.\nCabe destacar que los estudios que han analizado este tipo de PC son todavia escasos, probablemente debido a su menor frecuencia y mayor gravedad. Especialmente escasos son los estudios cognitivos y de neuroimagen, ya que las pruebas neuropsicologicas requieren de una destreza manual y/o de respuestas verbales y los estudios de neuroimagen implican la adquisicion de secuencias de resonancia magnetica en donde la persona debe permanecer quieta. \nLos estudios cognitivos realizados hasta el momento se focalizan principalmente en el rendimiento intelectual general, y evidencian que entre el 52% y el 65% de los casos presenta discapacidad intelectual. No obstante, cabe destacar que no existe un consenso sobre como evaluar el rendimiento intelectual en esta poblacion, con una gran variabilidad entre estudios. La aplicacion de tests psicometricos que requieren habilidades manipulativas y/o respuestas verbales pueden estar emmascarando e infravalorando el rendimiento intelectual real de estas personas. Los estudios que se focalizan en el rendimiento en funciones cognitivas especificas son escasos y se basan en muestras muy reducidas que a menudo no superan los 8 casos. Por otro lado, los estudios cualitativos de neuroimagen han hallado una afectacion de ganglios basales y talamo. Las primeras evidencias de estudios de resonancia magnetica de difusion apuntan a una afectacion mas extensa, con una mayor afectacion de la sustancia blanca. \nEs por ello que esta tesis tiene como objetivos principales: 1) identificar una medida objetiva de inteligencia adecuada para la gran heterogeneidad que existe en la PC, 2) describir el perfil cognitivo de una muestra relativamente amplia de personas con PC discinetica, y 3) analizar el estado de la sustancia blanca cerebral de esta poblacion mediante la tecnica del conectoma. Para ello se incluyeron en el estudio un total de 52 sujetos con PC discinetica y 52 sujetos control, a quienes se les administro una bateria neuropsicologia que evaluaba el rendimiento cognitivo general (mediante las Matrices progresivas de Raven - version color, el Test de vocabulario en imagenes de Peabody - III y la Escala no verbal de aptitud intelectual de Wechsler) y cinco dominios cognitivos especificos (atencion, visuopercepcion, lenguaje, aprendizaje y memoria y funcion ejecutiva) y se les realizo un estudio de resonancia magnetica estructural. \nLos resultados comparando las diferentes pruebas de inteligencia muestran un mayor potencial de las Matrices progresivas de Raven. Esta prueba demuestra una gran aplicabilidad en la PC, incluso en casos con una grave afectacion motora y pocas habilidades comunicativas. Tambien se evidencia que proporciona informacion completa sobre el rendimiento en funciones cognitivas especificas, tanto visuales como verbales, y que es sensible al estado de la estructura cerebral en fibras de asociacion y de proyeccion y estructuras subcorticales como los ganglios basales y el talamo.\nEn relacion al perfil cognitivo de la PC discinetica, los resultados a nivel grupal han evidenciado un rendimiento cognitivo por debajo del grupo control en todas las funciones cognitivas evaluadas a excepcion de la memoria de reconocimiento verbal. No obstante, estas alteraciones cognitivas se han relacionado con la alteracion motriz, hallandose una afectacion cognitiva mas generalizada a medida que incrementa la gravedad motora. En los casos mas leves, aquellos en los que existe deambulacion autonoma, se ha evidenciado un rendimiento similar al del grupo control en casi todas las funciones evaluadas a excepcion de las funciones visuoperceptivas, atencionales y de la memoria visual. Los casos moderados, en los que se requiere de ayuda para la deambulacion, han mostrado las mismas alteraciones cognitivas y se anaden dificultades en las areas de lenguaje receptivo. En el grupo mas grave, aquellos casos en que no es posible la deambulacion, se observa el mismo rendimiento que con el grupo general (un rendimiento inferior en todas las funciones cognitivas a excepcion de la memoria de reconocimiento verbal).\n En el estudio de neuroimagen realizado en una submuestra de 25 participantes con PC y 24 sujetos control, se ha demostrado una disrupcion de la conectividad cerebral a diferentes niveles (global, regional y a nivel de conexion). Este patron se caracteriza por una disrupcion generalizada de la sustancia blanca cerebral, pero una afectacion mas localizada de la integridad de esta, que incluye areas mas posteriores (parietal, occipital y temporal) y una relativa preservacion de las areas prefrontales. Tambien se evidencia alteracion en la conectividad hipocampal, asi como de estructuras subcorticales (principalmente en putamen y talamo). Por ultimo, se ha hallado una correlacion entre el estado de la sustancia blanca de la circuiteria sensoriomotora y el nivel de gravedad motriz (tanto gruesa como fina) y se ha evidenciado como la red formada por conexiones fronto-estriatales y fronto-parietales juega un papel relevante en el rendimiento cognitivo general de estos sujetos. \nEn el presente trabajo se discuten estos resultados en relacion a la literatura previa tanto en el ambito de la PC como en otras patologias, asi como teniendo en cuenta el desarrollo normativo.",

      "title": "Definition and classification of hyperkinetic movements in childhood",
      "abstract": "Hyperkinetic movements are unwanted or excess movements that are frequently seen in children with neurologic disorders. They are an important clinical finding with significant implications for diagnosis and treatment. However, the lack of agreement on standard terminology and definitions interferes with clinical treatment and research. We describe definitions of dystonia, chorea, athetosis, myoclonus, tremor, tics, and stereotypies that arose from a consensus meeting in June 2008 of specialists from different clinical and basic science fields. Dystonia is a movement disorder in which involuntary sustained or intermittent muscle contractions cause twisting and repetitive movements, abnormal postures, or both. Chorea is an ongoing random-appearing sequence of one or more discrete involuntary movements or movement fragments. Athetosis is a slow, continuous, involuntary writhing movement that prevents maintenance of a stable posture. Myoclonus is a sequence of repeated, often nonrhythmic, brief shock-like jerks due to sudden involuntary contraction or relaxation of one or more muscles. Tremor is a rhythmic back-and-forth or oscillating involuntary movement about a joint axis. Tics are repeated, individually recognizable, intermittent movements or movement fragments that are almost always briefly suppressible and are usually associated with awareness of an urge to perform the movement. Stereotypies are repetitive, simple movements that can be voluntarily suppressed. We provide recommended techniques for clinical examination and suggestions for differentiating between the different types of hyperkinetic movements, noting that there may be overlap between conditions. These definitions and the diagnostic recommendations are intended to be reliable and useful for clinical practice, communication between clinicians and researchers, and for the design of quantitative tests that will guide and assess the outcome of future clinical trials.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Many neurologic symptoms may appear without organic lesions of the nervous system. Based on the underlying mechanisms, psychogenic (or functional) neurologic diseases are classified into three categories: conversion disorders, factitious disorders, and malingering. Abnormalities in patients with conversion disorders are involuntary, whereas patients with the other two conditions are voluntary. Malingering, in particular, might be purposeful for personal benefits such as financial reasons and escape from jail. Common phenotypes of psychogenic neurologic diseases are motor paralysis, sensory loss, constriction of visual field, and seizures (psychogenic non-epileptic seizures, PNES). Clinical features common to all kinds of psychogenic neurologic disorders include incongruity with ordinary neurologic symptoms, inconsistency (variability) of nature, degree and distribution in time, change due to distraction to other stimuli or other matters, and the presence of psychogenic factors in the social or family background.",

      "title": "Head banging in early childhood.",
      "abstract": "Head banging is a curious behavior pattern sometimes seen in infants and young children. This activity is characterized by repetitive movements marked by a definite rhythm and monotonous continuity. The head is struck rhythmically against the head board, side railing of the crib, or other objects. This is not a tantrum type of behavior but is marked by an almost compulsive repetitiveness. Characteristically, it appears to commence sometime in the last half of the first year and is usually preceded by other less dramatic rhythmic motor behavior such as head or body rolling and crib rocking. While this behavior has come to the attention of medical practitioners, very little in the way of descriptive material or controlled research has been done. Gesell states, Rocking on hands and knees and bedshaking are common forms of deviation. Head banging and head rolling also have their origins in this period from 40 weeks to 21 months (5, p. 308). Spock (i2) discusses this rhythmic behavior under the subheading of Common Nervous Symptoms. Lourie (io) noted head banging in a study of 130 children who manifested a variety of rhythmic patterns. Other writers have noted this behavior, and references appear in medical, psychological and popular literature (i, 2, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 13)The purpose of this paper is to describe systematically head banging behavior of normal, not hospitalized young children. Specifically, this report describes the positions in which head banging takes place, the age of onset, the frequency and persistency, the tempo, and related factors. In addition, reaction to metronome stimulus and a follow-up study of behavioral patterns of a portion of the sample are described.' Thirty-three head bangers were observed under normal bedtime conditions; 23 were boys and Io were girls. The age range for the total group was from io to 49 months; average age was 26.6 months. All of the observations described in this report took place in the homes of the subjects. Twenty-six of the 33 subjects in this sample were obtained from referrals of practicing physicians in cities of upstate New York. Seven cases were found through personal contacts.",

The diagnosis of a chronic and recurrent mental disorder influences a person’s self-image and has a strong impact on all members of the family. In the adjustment to the diagnosis, each individual usually undergoes a process in which a variety of beliefs and emotions may arise that will have to be dealt with, in parallel to education about and acceptance of the disorder. It is common for denial to appear first, attributing what has happened to external factors. There is also a tendency for the patient to deny the chronic nature of the disorder, refusing the possibility that another episode may occur. The onset of the disease can often be accompanied by a marked sense of loss, experienced both by the person receiving the diagnosis and by his or her relatives: the loss of the healthy self together with an increase in the feeling of vulnerability, real losses as a consequence of the episodes (work is impaired, social difficulties arise, ruptures occur, family are affected, financial problems ensue, etc.) or perceived loss, sometimes erroneously, of expectations about the person him- or herself or about the future.",

      "abstract": "Tremor is the most common involuntary movement disorder. It can be an isolated symptom or a symptom of another neurological disorder, such as dystonia, Parkinson disease, spinocerebellar ataxia et al. It is an unintentional, somewhat rhythmic, muscle movement involving to-and-fro movements of one or more parts of the body. It can affect the hands, arms, head, vocal cord, jaw, chin, and legs. Most tremors occur in the hands. Clinically, the most useful way to categorized tremor is whether it occurs mainly at rest, on postural, or during movement (kinetic tremor). Tremor is most common classified by different clinical features and cause or origin; include essential tremor, Parkinsonian tremor, cerebellar tremor, dystonic tremor, orthostatic tremor, physiologic tremor, and psychogenic tremor. Diagnosis need a detail history (include familial inheritance, drugs exposure, alcohol consumption or withdraw); complete physical examination and laboratory tests. Electromyography is also a simple and quick method with which to calculate tremor frequency and amplitude for assisting diagnosis. Treatment for majority of tremor syndrome is purely symptomatic, and is similar regardless of the underlying cause of the tremor. There are different medicines to try in order propranolol, clonazepam, primidome and gabapentin for limb tremors, or trihexyphenidyl for dystonic tremor. Focal botulinum toxin injection may be help in focal tremor. Neurosurgery is only indicated in severe tremor, such as deep brain stimulation (DBS) of subthalamic nucleus for primary or secondary parkinsonian tremor.",

      "title": "Tourette’s Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Tourette’s syndrome (TS) is a neuropsychiatric disorder of childhood onset characterized by the presence of motor and vocal tics for a duration of at least 1 year. Tics are typically brief and stereotypical movements (eg, eye blinking, head jerks) or vocalizations (eg, throat clearing, grunting), but they can also be more complex movements involving multiple muscle groups and combinations of movements and sounds. There is a great range of tic severity. Tics can be so subtle or occur so infrequently as to be unnoticeable, even to the person with the tics. However, tics can also be so intense and frequent that they are readily noticeable by others, and they can be disruptive of daily activities. Indeed, in some cases (eg, severe head jerks), tics can cause pain or physical injury (eg, cervical disc and spine damage). Tics usually begin in childhood; the average age at diagnosis is 7 years. They reach peak severity in the early teen years and then lessen in intensity and frequency during young adulthood (Leckman et al., 2001). Tics wax and wane in severity, worsening with excitement and stress and improving during calm, focused activities. Coprolalia and its motor counterpart copropraxia (uttering obscene words or making obscene gestures, respectively) are uncommon symptoms, occurring in less than 10% of patients with TS and are not required for a diagnosis of TS (Robertson and Stern, 1998). Many patients describe a sensation or urge prior to tic occurrence, commonly referred to as a premonitory sensation or urge (Miguel et a1., 2000). Even though tics are considered involuntary, they can be voluntarily suppressed for short periods of time. Prevalence estimates of TS have varied and depend a great deal on the threshold for diagnosis and setting in which cases are identified. A review of the many epidemiologic studies suggests that 0.1% to 1% of people are affected with TS (Scahill et al., 2005). Despite this variability in specific rates, epidemiologic studies have consistently identified that males are more commonly affected than females, children are more frequently affected than adults, and that milder forms of TS are more common than severe forms.",

This is an etiologically heterogeneous\r\nentity, which might be due to dysfunctions at various levels in the basal ganglia, and especially\r\nin the substantia nigra (SN) and striatum. The parkinsonism can be classified into four broad\r\ncategories: (i) Parkinson's disease (PD, MIM#168600), also called primary parkinsonism, or typical\r\nparkinsonism, which includes the common, idiopathic form, and the rare forms with a recently\r\ndefined genetic etiology; (ii) parkinsonism-plus syndromes, which include different idiopathic,\r\nbut atypical neurodegenerative forms of parkinsonism (additional motor neurologic features are\r\npresent); (iii) secondary parkinsonism, which is caused by known, non-genetic etiologies, such as\r\nenvironmental insults (drugs, toxins, viruses), inflammation, tissue infiltration/compression or\r\nischemia; (iv) parkinsonism in the context of other degenerative disorders, with or without a known\r\ngenetic cause, in which parkinsonism represents a minor, or occasional component of the clinical\r\npicture (table 1 ).\r\nIn the primary forms of parkinsonism (PD) the initial symptoms occur typically in one side of\r\nthe body, spreading in a few years to the contralateral side. However, a certain degree of clinical\r\nasymmetry persists during the more advanced phases of the disease (the body side where\r\nthe symptoms started remains the more severely affected). Moreover, these motor symptoms\r\ndisplay typically a substantial beneficial response to the therapy with levodopa. While the motor\r\nsymptoms dominate the clinical picture, many PD patients have also other, non-motor problems,\r\nsuch as fatigue, depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances, constipation, bladder and other autonomic\r\ndisturbances, and sensory complaints (2).\r\nThe diagnosis of primary parkinsonism (PD) remains based on the presence of the clinical\r\nsyndrome, and the exclusion of other (secondary) causes.",

Epilepsy affects people of all ages, ethnicities, sexes, levels of education, socioeconomic status, and social classes worldwide. The prodrome phase is a pre-epileptic feeling or experience that might start hours, days, or even weeks in advance of the actual seizure. The most prevalent prodromal phase symptoms include difficulties maintaining focus, tension, exhaustion, sleep disruptions, behavioral changes (differently smelling, tasting, having ringing in the ears, feeling queasy, etc.), restlessness, and others. The ictal phase defined as spans the interval between the start of a seizure and its conclusion. The phrase \"interictal\" refers to a phase that occurs between seizures or headaches. \"Postictal\" refers to the period following a seizure.

The neurologic disturbances that produce postural and gait abnormalities can be categorized under three headings: (1) afferent or sensory dysfunction, (2) efferent or motor dysfunction, and (3) central or integrative dysfunction.",

      "title": "Neglect and Related Disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract Neglect is the failure to report, respond, or orient to novel or meaningful stimuli presented to the side opposite a brain lesion, when this failure cannot be attributed to either sensory or motor defects (Heilman, 1979). Neglect may be spatial or personal. Spatial neglect may occur in three reference frames: body centered, environmentally centered, and object centered. One may be inattentive to stimuli in space or on the person (attentional or sensory neglect) and one may fail to act in a portion of space, in a spatial direction, or to use a portion of one’s body (intentional or motor neglect). Many specific disorders have been described, distinguished by their presumed underlying mechanisms, the distribution of the abnormal behavior, and the means of eliciting the behavior. Different behavioral manifestations may occur at different times, and in some patients certain manifestations are never seen. The major behavioral manifestations that we will discuss in this chapter include (1) inattention or sensory neglect, (2) extinction to simultaneous stimuli, (3) motor neglect, (4) spatial neglect, (5) personal neglect, (6) allesthesia and allokinesia, and (7) anosognosia (unawareness of illness). The first section of this chapter will define specific disorders and describe clinical tests that may be used to assess them.",

      "abstract": "Dangerous practices and games at school. Three separate categories of dangerous games can be distinguished. The non-oxygenating or fainting games, which consist of mechanical compressions or strangulative mechanisms. These are performed in the search of pseudo-hallucinogenic sensations. There are several such games: from the simple but non-the-less dangerous \"tomato game\", performed by younger children (from 3-4 years of age), to the \"choking game\", between 7 and 14 years of age. \"Aggressive\" or \"violent\" games which use physical and psychological violence from a group of people towards a single individual. Acute neurological complications can be the consequence of such games, and their degree depends on the duration and intensity of the strangulation. These can vary from cerebral edema, loss of consciousness, long term cerebral damage (deafness, blindness, bedridden), irreversible coma and death. Physical consequences of aggressive games are equally important, such as vertebral fractures, cranial trauma, organ rupture. Victims of violence present repeated psycho-traumatic manifestations. Preventive messages associate information on the risks of such games with civic education (listening, solidarity and trust in others), the development of psychological and social skills, an active involvement in school-life and concrete responsibility taking. Early identification of symptoms of these practices by family members and professionals helps to avoid their repetition and increased danger, even addictive patterns.Pratiques et jeux dangereux en milieu scolaire. Les pratiques dangereuses en cour d’école sont multiples. Les jeux dits de non-oxygénation ou d’évanouissement consistent, par un mécanisme de compression ou de strangulation, à rechercher certaines sensations pseudo-hallucinatoires. Les jeux dits d’agression ou jeux violents utilisent la violence physique ou psychologique de manière gratuite d’un groupe de jeunes envers une personne seule. Leur caractère répétitif dans le temps définit le harcèlement. La durée et l’intensité de la strangulation peuvent induire des complications neurologiques aiguës (oedème cérébral, perte de connaissance prolongée), des lésions cérébrales définitives (surdité, cécité, état grabataire), un coma irréversible, le décès. Les conséquences physiques des jeux d’agression sont très lourdes : fractures de la colonne vertébrale, traumatismes crâniens, ruptures d’organes. Les enfants victimes ont des manifestations psychotraumatiques répétées. Les messages de prévention associent, outre une information sur les risques, une éducation à la citoyenneté (écoute, cohésion, solidarité, confiance en l’autre), le développement de compétences psychologiques et sociales de l’enfant, une implication active du jeune dans la vie scolaire et la prise de responsabilités concrètes. Le repérage par les familles et les professionnels de symptômes chroniques évocateurs de ces pratiques permet d’éviter leur répétition et leur dangerosité encore accrue, voire un passage à l’addiction.",

      "abstract": "Stressful life events have been linked to the onset of severe psychopathology and endocrine dysfunction in many patients.Moreover, vulnerability to the later development of such disorders can be increased by stress or adversity during development (e.g., childhood neglect, abuse, or trauma).This review discusses the methodological features and results of various models of stress in nonhuman primates in the context of their potential relevance for human psychopathology and endocrine dysfunction, particularly mood disorders and dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) system.Such models have typically examined the effects of stress on the animals' behavior, endocrine function ( primarily the HPA and hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal systems), and, in some cases, immune status.Manipulations such as relocation and/or removal of an animal from its current social group or, alternatively, formation of a new social group can have adverse effects on all of these outcome measures that may be either transient or more persistent depending on the species, sex, and other experimental conditions.Social primates may also experience significant stress associated with their rank in the group's dominance hierarchy.Finally, stress during prenatal development or during the early postnatal period may have long-lasting neurobiological and endocrine effects that manifest in an altered ability to cope behaviorally and physiologically with later challenges.Whereas early exposure to severe stress usually results in deficient coping abilities, certain kinds of milder stressors can promote subsequent resilience in the animal.We conclude that studies of stress in nonhuman primates can model many features of stress exposure in human populations and that such studies can play a valuable role in helping to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the role of stress in human psychopathology and endocrine dysfunction.",

From the moment clinicians first see patients, they quite naturally notice many things about their motor behavior: body posture, degree of muscle tension, amount of fidgeting or pacing and facial expression. The muscles of the eye and face are innervated by cranial nerves that originate in the brain. Consequently, disturbances in facial or eye muscle functioning provide crucial clues about whether individua's difficulties originate in the nervous system outside the brain or within brain. Neurological soft signs are subtle, lifelong abnormalities in motor and sensory functioning that are likely caused by imperfect embryonic development or minor, early brain injury. “Automatic behavior” refers to rote movement behaviors that are carried out by individuals in an altered state of consciousness. An apraxia might involve difficulty in performing relatively simple movements or complex action sequences involving objects.",

Such behaviour is generally a consequence of disruption of the normal chemical milieu of the central nervous system and, in humans, stereotypy is usually seen as an unwanted side-effect of medications or, in the context of primary disease of the nervous system, as one of the so-called movement disorders. The taxonomy of the movement disorders is controversial and often confusing even to those well versed in neurology. One approach is to divide the disorders into those in which motor activity is either increased (hyperkinetic) or decreased (hypokinetic) or those predominantly affecting tone (i.e. the resistance to passive movement). Even this classification has its difficulties, since Parkinson’s disease, for example, one of the commonest movement disorders, is characterized simultaneously by too little motor activity (bradykinesia), excessive movement (tremor), and increased muscular tone or rigidity. For the purposes of this chapter, we will first deal with primary hyperkinetic disorders, and then discuss drug-induced involuntary movements. The hyperkinetic disorders can be subclassified into tremor, chorea, tic, myoclonus, and dystonia.",

The content of obsessions is ego‐dystonic, meaning that they are experienced as intrusive, unwanted, and generally inconsistent with one's self‐image, values, beliefs, and behaviors. Obsessions differ from ego‐syntonic thoughts about everyday problems (e.g., recurrent thoughts or worries about finances, occupation, relationships, and the like) and should be distinguished from the “brooding” ruminations that are common in depression. Typical obsessions include doubts about whether one did something adequately (e.g., turned off the stove); intrusive sexual, aggressive, or religious thoughts or images (e.g., horrific image of stabbing a friend); thoughts about contamination; and excessive concerns about symmetry or exactness. Individuals with Obsessive‐Compulsive Disorder (OCD) experience frequent obsessions that are severe enough to cause significant functioning impairment and try to suppress or neutralize their obsessions with other thoughts or compulsive actions. Unlike individuals with psychotic or delusional disorders, individuals with OCD generally recognize their obsessions as senseless and know that the obsessions originate in their own minds.",

      "abstract": "A neuropsychiatric and -psychological update of the crime “profile” and “signature” is a necessary addition to the traditional sociopsychological model likely to miss limbic system dysfunctioning. Thus, occurrence of a brief (c. 20 minutes) limbic seizure has been proposed based on behaviors of 12 white male homicidal loners, who showed a dozen symptoms and signs: Limbic Psychotic Trigger Reaction. Readily overlooked can be (a) a transient psychosis (hallucinations and/or delusions), (b) autonomic hyperactivation (e.g., loss of bladder control, nausea, ejaculation), (c) motiveless, out-of-character, unplanned, and well-remembered homicidal acts, (d) committed with a flat affect (not emotionally or impulsively provoked), (e) typically involving a stranger who happened to provide an objectively harmless and only subjectively important stimulus. (f) Such an individualized stimulus triggered the memory revival of mild to moderate but repeatedly experienced hurts. Such a specific sequence of events implicates the specific mechanism of limbic seizure, “kindling,” which does not necessarily involve motor convulsions. Repetition of such limbic episodes with “criminal acts” is conceivable under specific circumstances including cases in which the triggering stimulus is associated with pleasurable delusions (e.g., of grandiose power or wealth) or constitutes a specific aspect of a basic drive motive. For example, eating or sexual activities might be planned but degenerate into a limbic episode with a specific core symptomatology.",

The disease is apparently inherited as a dominant trait; x-linkage cannot be excluded. The diagnosis was based on the following criteria; (1) attacks of stiffness precipitated by surprise or minor physical contact; difficulty in sudden movements but absence of signs of myotonia or myokymia; (2) presence of the electromyographic counterpart of the stiffness, continuous activity at rest with normal action potentials; (3) disappearance of the continuous electrical activity after diazepam. The symptoms were most marked in infancy, but ameliorated with time, becoming milder than in the average acquired case. The cause of this familial syndrome is presumably different from that or those of acquired, sporadic cases of stiff-man syndrome.",

Alternatively, an individual may merely feel socially isolated, alienated, and fraught with physical reactions (e.g., shakes) that are unpleasant.

These same methods may also afford cognitive enhancement in people of otherwise normal cognitive abilities. 'Cosmetic', or supranormal, cognitive enhancement offers opportunities to enrich our social or financial status, our interactions with others, and the common wealth of our community. It is common to focus on the potential benefits of cognitive enhancement, while being less than clear about the possible drawbacks. Here I examine the harms or side-effects associated with a range of cognitive enhancement interventions. I propose a taxonomy of harms in cognitive enhancement, with harms classified as (neuro)biological, ethical, or societal. Biological harms are those that directly affect the person's biological functioning, such as when a drug affects a person's mood or autonomic function. Ethical harms are those that touch on issues such as fairness and cheating, or on erosion of autonomy and coercion. Societal harms are harms that affect whole populations, and which are normally the province of governments, such as the use of enhancement in military contexts. This taxonomy of harms will help to focus the debate around the use and regulation of cognitive enhancement. In particular it will help to clarify the appropriate network of stakeholders who should take an interest in each potential harm, and in minimising the impact of these harms.",

      "abstract": "Dyskinesia is characterized by complex, irregular involuntary movements involving lips, tongue, extremities, and/or trunk. The term “dyskinesia” is often used to encompass complex involuntary movements that do not fit into another category of involuntary movements. Focal dyskinesia is commonly seen in the lips and tongue (orolingual dyskinesia or oral dyskinesia). Drug side effects are the most common cause of generalized dyskinesia, usually those that influence dopamine such as L-dopa and neuroleptics (drug-induced dyskinesia, tardive dyskinesia). Motor stereotypies are repetitive occurrences of the same movements; movements commonly encountered in this condition range from simple movements like shaking arms and nodding to complex movements. Motor stereotypies are commonly observed in children with Asperger syndrome, Rett syndrome and other automatisms, and mental retardation. In adults, stereotyped movements are seen in cases of severe infectious encephalitis, autoimmune encephalitis (e.g., limbic encephalitis), cerebrovascular diseases involving the frontal lobe, and neurodegenerative diseases like frontotemporal lobar degeneration. Tics are irregular, typically brisk movements ranging from shock-like simple movements resembling myoclonus (simple tic) to complex movements (complex tic). Patients with tics tend to repeat certain movements like blinking or grimacing, but in the patients with Gilles de la Tourette syndrome, tics appear as a variety of movements including vocalization (vocal tic). These patients can stop the movements for several seconds, but it is often followed by rebound; they often feel an urge to move before a bout of tics and feel release after the bout.",

They can emerge due to genetic factors or abnormalities in the brain or body acquired after birth, or because of faulty or incomplete physical experiences when learning more complex behavior. Many are first identified in infancy, but onset can occur over the lifespan. Some of these disorders are progressive in nature, whereas others are nonprogressive or static. Individuals diagnosed with these disorders display various motor, perceptual, intellectual, neuropsychological, and psychosocial impairments. The general intellectual functioning level of individuals with motor disorders is variable, with some functioning in the average range and others experiencing significant impairment. Psychological outcomes are also variable. Individuals diagnosed with neurodegenerative disorders frequently experience significant mental deterioration.",

One of the factors causing motor delayed is the hypothyroid hormone. Thyroid hormone has a vital role in the growth, metabolism, and regulation of body fluids. Thyroid hormone deficiency cause growth failure, and mental retardation. Early detection of motor delay can be done by using Denver Development Screening Test (DDST). This test is done with the purpose to follow the process of child development, to overcome early if found development delay. Physiotherapy is needed to deal with delays in motor development. Therapeutic exercise is one of the modalities of physiotherapy in motor improvement using body movement exercises either actively or passively.\r\nKeywords: motor delay; hypothyroid; therapeutic exercise\r\n\r\nABSTRAK\r\n\r\nMotor delay adalah kondisi yang mempengaruhi fungsi tubuh atau stuktur, dapat membatasi aktivitas fisik seperti merangkak, berjalan, meraih atau aktivitas sehari-hari dan dapat membatasi partisipasi dan aktivitas fisik pada anak. Salah satu faktor yang menyebabkan motor delayed adalah hormon hipotiroid. Hormon tiroid memiliki peran vital dalam pertumbuhan, metabolisme, dan pengaturan cairan tubuh. Kekurangan hormon tiroid dapat menyebabkan kegagalan pertumbuhan, juga dapat mengakibatkan keterbelakangan mental pada penderitanya. Deteksi dini keterlambatan motorik dapat dilakukan dengan menggunakan DDST II (Denver Development Screening Test). Tes ini dilakukan dengan tujuan untuk mengikuti proses perkembangan anak, dan mengatasi secara dini bila ditemukan keterlambatan perkembangan. Fisioterapi diperlukan untuk menangani keterlambatan perkembangan motorik. Terapi latihan adalah salah satu modalitas fisioterapi dalam proses perbaikan motorik dengan menggunakan latihan- latihan gerakan tubuh baik secara aktif maupun pasif. Terapi latihan yang diberikan oleh fisioterapi pada anak dengan hormon hipotiroid, diharapkan dapat memberikan kemajuan perkembangan pada anak tersebut sehingga dapat mencapai tingkat perkembangan yang seoptimal mungkin sesuai dengan usia anak.\r\nKata kunci: motor delay; hormon hipotiroid; terapi latihan",

      "abstract": "Psychological reactions to negative life events have been among the most interesting subjects to researchers for a long time. In recent years post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), in particular, has been the focus of numerous studies. This disorder is defined as a reaction to an event that is accepted as traumatic by almost everyone, to an extraordinary life-threatening event, or to a disaster. Psychological reaction to events, which are not directly life threatening, is classified as adjustment disorder and is rarely diagnosed in clinical practice. As a result of experiencing such non-life threatening events, PTSD is claimed to be an adjustment disorder as well. Immigrants frequently report a depressive state in which physical symptoms are in the foreground accompanied by social withdrawal and diminished energy. Negative life events, which are not life threatening and are not experienced everyday, can impair mental health so that the above state may worsen and an immigrant may have a reduction in his performance at work. This state, which is accompanied by such symptoms as embitterment, feelings of injustice, repeated intrusive memories of critical events (injustice at work place, loss of a job, discrimination in a public office, etc.), phobic symptoms, and avoidance behavior towards the place or persons related to the event, might best be described by the term, posttraumatic embitterment disorder (PTED). This disorder, which was initially described in immigrants from East Germany following the fall of the Berlin Wall, and which does not exactly match the diagnostic criteria of adjustment disorder or PTSD, is presented in a case vignette and its differential diagnosis is discussed.",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics STXBP1 encephalopathy with epilepsy is characterized by early-onset encephalopathy with epilepsy (i.e., moderate-to-severe intellectual disability, refractory seizures, and ongoing epileptiform activity). The median age of onset of seizures is six weeks (range 1 day to 13 years). Seizure types can include infantile spasms; generalized tonic-clonic, clonic, or tonic seizures; and myoclonic, focal, atonic, and absence seizures. Epilepsy syndromes can include Ohtahara syndrome, West syndrome, Lennox-Gaustaut syndrome, and Dravet syndrome (not SCN1A-related), classic Rett syndrome (not MECP2-related), and atypical Rett syndrome (not CDKL5-related). The EEG is characterized by focal epileptic activity, burst suppression, hypsarrhythmia, or generalized spike-and-slow waves. Other findings can include abnormal tone, movement disorders (especially ataxia and dystonia), and behavior disorders (including autism spectrum disorder). Feeding difficulties are common. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis is established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous intragenic pathogenic variant in STXBP1 or a contiguous gene deletion that includes STXBP1 and adjacent genes on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Developmental delay, cognitive dysfunction, and intellectual disability are managed in the usual manner. The most commonly used anti-seizure medications (ASMs) are phenobarbital, valproic acid, and vigabatrin; an estimated 20% of individuals require more than one ASM and approximately 25% are refractory to ASM therapy. Severe dystonia, dyskinesia, and choreoathetosis can be treated with monoamine depleters or dopaminergic agents. Behavior disorders and feeding difficulties are managed symptomatically in the usual manner. Surveillance: Neuropsychological assessment and EEG are performed as needed. Genetic counseling STXBP1 encephalopathy with epilepsy is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. To date, most probands represent simplex cases (i.e., a single occurrence in a family) and have the disorder as a result of a de novo STXBP1 pathogenic variant. Individuals with STXBP1 encephalopathy with epilepsy are not known to reproduce. Once the STXBP1 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

Early head-turning, which is not usually forceful, is mostly ipsilateral and typically co-occurs with a dystonic posture in the contralateral upper extremity.[1] Postictal aphasia is commonly related to dominant temporal seizures.[2] The frontal lobe is known to be the second most common origin of focal-onset seizures after the temporal lobe. Many different seizure types can occur in frontal lobe seizures. Asymmetrical tonic or postural seizures are usually related to the involvement of the supplementary motor area. A nonspecific aura may precede frontal lobe seizures with impaired consciousness that start abruptly and are accompanied by bizarre behaviors and agitation. Misdiagnosis as a psychogenic seizure may result in challenging patient management. Although the semiology of seizures is beneficial regarding lateralization of the lobe where the seizure originates, semiologic findings can become confusing by the spread of ictal discharges to other parts of the hemisphere. It is essential to remember that seizures originating from the frontal lobe may propagate to the temporal lobe and imitate clinical signs typical of temporal lobe seizures. Ictal whistling is an extremely rare presentation, and ictal onset in electroencephalography (EEG) is defined primarily from the temporal lobe. It has also rarely been shown to originate from the frontal lobe.[3] Herein, we present a patient with tuberous sclerosis complex disorder and treatment-resistant seizures, accompanied by different types of whistling, one was like \"tweeting,\" who achieved significant benefits from everolimus treatment. A 34-year-old right-handed male patient had his first seizure when he was aged 13 years old when he was asleep at night, which manifested with screaming, snapping fingers, whistling, and kicking with his foot. He describes a strange feeling in his epigastric area before some but not all seizures. Afterward, his family describes hand automatisms, loss of awareness, whistling, snapping fingers, and pulling at his clothes. The patient is amnestic for this period. Despite multiple anti-seizure drug regimens, including valproic acid, carbamazepine, topiramate, levetiracetam, lacosamide, and zonisamide, the frequency of seizures continued once or twice per week. Due to the increased frequency of seizures to three to four times per week, the patient was admitted to the video EEG monitoring unit to differentiate between epileptic–nonepileptic seizures while he was receiving maximum doses of valproic acid, lacosamide, levetiracetam, and zonisamide polytherapy. Angiofibromas in the malar area on his face and ungual fibromas were noticed during hospitalization [Figure 1]. The patient was consulted by the dermatology department, and a diagnosis of tuberous sclerosis complex was made according to the clinical criteria. In the brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), an increase in the focal sulcus distance, remodeling in the tabula interna in the bifrontoparietal region, and focal thickenings were detected in the calvarium. There were no cortical tubers [Figure 2]. In positron emission tomography–computed tomography, minimal hypometabolism was seen in the bilateral temporal lobe anterior cortex. Multiple angiomyolipomas were detected in the contrast-enhanced MRI of the abdomen.Figure 1: Black arrows indicate anjiofibromas involving the malar regions of the face (a) and ungual fibromas on the toes (b)Figure 2: White arrows indicate the increase in the focal sulcus distance and remodeling in the tabula interna in the bifrontoparietal region and focal thickenings in the coronal T2 brain magnetic resonance imaging (a), and hypometabolism in the bilateral temporal lobe anterior cortex in coronal slices of F18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography (b)In video EEG monitorization, electrode placement was made according to the International 10–20 system with the addition of extra temporal electrodes (corresponding to positions T1 and T2). During monitorization, we recorded three seizures with the same clinical and electrophysiologic findings [Video 1]. First, the patient screamed, whistled briefly and loudly, and shook both hands. A head deviation that was not forceful was observed for a few seconds concurrent with hand clapping. Afterward, flexor dystonic posture occurred in the left hand while the right hand simultaneously rubbed his face. After 2 to 3 s, a low tone finger snapping started repeatedly on the right hand. Then, automatisms were observed in both hands, such as clapping hands and clothes pulling, predominantly in the genital area. The patient started to whistle softly and repeatedly like a tweeting bird. At the end of the seizure, he wiped his nose with his right hand. He nodded his head in a yes response to questions but could not respond verbally. This behavior gave the impression of regained partial awareness with aphasia. {\"href\":\"Single Video Player\",\"role\":\"media-player-id\",\"content-type\":\"play-in-place\",\"position\":\"float\",\"orientation\":\"portrait\",\"label\":\"Video Clip 1\",\"caption\":\"\",\"object-id\":[{\"pub-id-type\":\"doi\",\"id\":\"\"},{\"pub-id-type\":\"other\",\"content-type\":\"media-stream-id\",\"id\":\"1_3bejt9gl\"},{\"pub-id-type\":\"other\",\"content-type\":\"media-source\",\"id\":\"Kaltura\"}]} In EEG, concurrent with the beginning of the seizure, widespread low-amplitude fast-frequency activity started. After 10 s, diffuse muscle artifacts appeared for 2–3 s during the whistling and screaming. Immediately afterward, the EEG evolved to rhythmic slow spike and delta waves in both frontotemporoparietal areas with right dominancy, which continued for about 70 s, with a higher amplitude in the right hemisphere. At the end of the seizure, the amplitude and frequency decreased within 10 s and then ended. In the postictal period, there was a widespread voltage depression that lasted for 30 s, and then background activity returned to normal. During the video EEG monitorization, there were sharp slow wave discharges with phase confrontations in the F8-T2 and T2-T4 electrodes on the right hemisphere in the interictal period. Everolimus treatment was started on the patient who had renal angiomyolipomas and seizures resistant to polytherapy. After the 2nd month of treatment, the frequency of seizures decreased to 3 to 4 per month, and the patient was reportedly seizure-free after the 4th month of treatment. We first gradually reduced and then stopped the zonisamide treatment. The valproic acid treatment was also tapered and stopped at the 6th month of the everolimus treatment because the patient reported tremors in his hands. DISCUSSION Whistling seizures have been rarely described in the literature, with only eight cases reported, most of which were primarily associated with the temporal lobe and rarely with the frontal lobe.[3-8] It was also reported as postictal whistling in a patient with Lennox–Gastaut syndrome with generalized epileptic discharges and was associated with the involvement of multiple networks.[9] No lateralizing finding could be detected at the beginning of the EEG of our patient during different nonverbal vocalizations after short-term high-volume whistling. However, the time-match scalp EEG record showing generalized low amplitude fast frequency activity, and the left hand's dystonic posture were signs of frontal lobe origin. However, when the \"tweeting\" occurred, the rhythmic electrical activity evolved to bilateral frontotemporoparietal regions with higher amplitudes at the right hemisphere. Controversial reports exist regarding the lateralizing value of ictal whistling. Right temporal lobe focus examples have been described more frequently in the literature. It has been suggested that whistling seizures are often associated with complex motor behaviors due to the involvement of the nondominant hemisphere.[6] However, in functional MRI studies, early activation in the left supplementary motor area and the presupplementary motor area was observed in right-handed individuals during whistling.[10] It has been suggested that this area is effective in the onset of whistling. The ongoing whistling process continues through a more comprehensive bihemispheric network that includes structures such as the premotor cortex, cingulate cortex, thalamus, basal ganglia, and amygdala.[10] Other motor findings of our patient, such as the dystonic posture in the left hand and postictal nose wiping with the right hand, indicate activation of the right hemisphere. Another finding in our patient was that finger snapping could occur in frontal and temporal epilepsy. Finger snapping that occurs once and loudly has been attributed to the frontal region in the literature.[11] Otherwise, temporal finger snapping occurs repeatedly. It is less loud, as in our patient, the finger snap occurred in the later phase of the seizure simultaneously with the bifrontotemporal EEG activity appearance.[12] All seizures of our patient in the video EEG monitoring unit started with widespread rapid activity and continued with ictal activity in both frontotemporoparietal regions with right dominancy as the tweeting began. This finding supports the idea that tweeting occurs with the activation of multifunctional networks in different brain regions. In our patient, the left dystonic posture and right nasal wiping point to the right hemisphere, but postictal aphasia is localized to the dominant hemisphere, most likely the left. The patient was right-handed, and most probably, the left hemisphere was dominant in this patient, yet a functional MRI could not be performed. We think such complexity regarding semiologic features is related to the fast temporal evolving model. Invasive EEG electrode placement may be informative about seizure onset and evaluation. Nevertheless, the contribution of the interhemispheric connections needs to be clarified. In conclusion, whistling seizures are extremely rare presentations of focal epileptic seizures. Our case report is rare and unique with tweeting seizure phonology. Furthermore, two types of whistling appeared in the same seizure; short and sharp whistling showing the frontal lobe, and tweeting, indicating temporal lobe involvement.

Two patterns - one consisting in catalepsy, posturing, mutism and negativism and a second consisting of echophenomenon, automatic obedience, verbigeration, and other stereotypies - have been abstracted. Catatonia has been associated with psychiatric disorders - schizophrenia and bipolar disorder for example - as well as secondary to various underlying medical conditions.It will be described a case report of a 55 years old woman with prior psychiatric history of hospitalization with an unspecified nonorganic psychosis (F29-ICD10), presenting features of catatonia - immobility with fixed posture and gaze (sometimes presenting posturing), an almost absence of spontaneous movements and speech, echophenomenon (echolalia, palilalia, coprolalia) erupting in a otherwise mute state and showing, on occasions, periods of purposelessness motor excitement and restlessness, verbigeration and screaming with a grim of terror. She was disoriented and performed poorly on the MMSE. No neurologic focal signs were disclosed other than prominent primitive reflexes. Prior to admission, her family reported a sudden mood change: she became irritable, argumentative, with delusional thought content of persecutory nature, grandiose ideas. Viral and immune-mediated encephalitis were discharged. The MRI scan showed a right temporal medial lesion (amygdala atrophy). It will be addressed the hypothetical relationship between the dramatic clinical presentation and the cerebral lesion, grounded on the scientific research regarding limbic encephalitis, catatonic symptoms and neurophysiology. It will also be underscored the clinical relevance of differentiated psychopathology of catatonia.",

Some are psychoform (e.g., one dissociative agent hearing another dissociative agent speak), others are somatoform, or sensory and motor (e.g., being analgesic while another dissociative agent is in pain). Somatoform and psychoform dissociative symptoms often occur together. Somatoform dissociative symptoms are characteristic of dissociative disorders and proportional to their complexity. The disorders include ICD-10's Dissociative Disorders of Movement and Sensation, inadequately renamed in ICD-11 Dissociative Neurological Symptom Disorder. Sensory and motor dissociative disorders are categorized in DSM-5 as Conversion Disorder. This is confusing, because the symptoms involve dissociation, not conversion of something mental into something physical. PTSD, which can be seen as a simple dissociative disorder, is associated with marked somatoform dissociation. Adverse events, particularly chronic interpersonal abuse and neglect, and the motivational conflicts this adversity typically implies, constitute an important causal factor of somatoform dissociation.",

The pathophysiology remains obscure; physical investigations are usually performed to exclude pathology rather than elucidate dysfunction. However, modern neuroimaging has allowed the study of nervous system structure and function. Although there are few diagnostically specific findings, patterns of association have emerged: where action is impeded (certain forms of conversion disorder and chronic fatigue syndrome) frontal systems of the brain are often implicated; when subjective awareness of the body is disturbed (passivity phenomena and anorexia nervosa) temporo-parietal cortices appear to be dysfunctional. The caudate nuclei (components of the frontal executive circuit) are implicated in a variety of syndromes (including body dysmorphic disorder, somatisation and chronic fatigue). The brain may be viewed as a cognitive neurobiological entity, crucially oriented towards action (for survival).

      "title": "Blunt Force Trauma",
      "abstract": "Abstract Blunt injuries are caused by mechanical force resulting in damage to the affected tissues mainly due to compression, traction, torsion, and shear stresses. The impact is induced either by a moving blunt object hitting the body or the victim's movement against an obstacle having a hard surface. In forensic practice, injuries from blunt force are often seen after criminal assaults where they may be inflicted, for instance, by fist blows or kicking. They not only occur in physical child abuse and other kinds of domestic violence, in traffic, sports, and industrial accidents but also in falls brought about by the victims themselves for various reasons (e.g., in drunken, infirm, or sick persons or in suicides jumping from a height). On skin, blunt traumatization produces abrasions, contusions (bruises), and lacerations. In some cases, a patterned configuration helps to determine characteristic features of the causative instrument. Within the body, blunt traumatization may be followed by bone fractures and laceration/rupture of vessels and organs with concomitant blood loss and potential failure of vital functions. The article shortly describes and illustrates the most important manifestations of blunt force injuries (including head trauma) under reconstructive aspects and from the medicolegal point of view.",

Numerous synaptic relays and neurotransmitters allow the autonomic control of organ function at local and central levels to be integrated with the requirements of the whole body. The peripheral and central components of the autonomic nervous system are frequently affected by diseases, conditions, or toxins. Autonomic disorders are described as (1) primary—without defined cause, including multiple system atrophy and acute/subacute dysautonomias; or (2) secondary—with specific defects or as a consequence of other conditions, including diabetes mellitus, Riley–Day syndrome, amyloid neuropathy, dopamine β-hydroxylase deficiency, spinal cord injury, and many drugs.",

Revisão bibliográfica: A ST é definido pelo Manual Diagnóstico e Estatístico de Transtornos Mentais (DSM-5) pela presença de tiques motores e fônicos antes dos 18 anos de idade e persistindo por um período superior a 12 meses sem uma causa secundária. É mais comum em homens do que em mulheres (3:1), com uma prevalência relatada variando entre 0,3 e 1% na população geral. Os tiques motores são movimentos motores estereotipados súbitos, rápidos, recorrentes e não rítmicos, geralmente precedidos por um impulso. Os tiques vocais incluem qualquer tique que produza ruído: cheirar, grunhir, cantarolar, clicar, gritar palavras repetidamente. Considerações finais: A ST é um distúrbio do neurodesenvolvimento nos quais os pacientes apresentam tiques por um período maior que um ano, sendo uma condição associada a diversas comorbidades como transtorno de déficit de atenção e hiperatividade, transtorno obsessivo-compulsivo, transtorno de ansiedade, ou transtorno desafiador opositivo.

      "abstract": "Tic and myoclonus are involuntary movement disorders, but the first is suppressible while the later is non suppressible. Myoclonus describes a symptom and generally is not a diagnosis of a disease. It refers to sudden, involuntary jerking of a muscle or group of muscles, vairable in intensity and frequency. Myoclonic twitches or jerks usually are caused by sudden muscle contractions, called positive myoclonus, or by muscle relaxation, called negative myoclonus.Myoclonic jerks may occur alone or in sequence, in a pattern or without pattern. They may occur infrequently or many times each minute. Myoclonus sometimes occurs in response to an external event or when a person attempts to make a movement. The twitching cannot be controlled by the person experiencing it. Tic is a nonvoluntary body movement or vocal sound that is made repeatedly, rapidly, suddenly and suppressible. It has a stereotyped but nonrhythmic character. Tics are type of dyskinesia, which is the general medical term given to impairments or distortions of voluntary movements. Although tics vary considerably in severity, they are associated with several neuropsychiatric disorders in children and adolescents. Tics management is including education and medical treatment as well as botox injection. The holistic treatment of tic is not only for the tics, but also for the medical illness which sometimes convey the disease.",

      "abstract": "Somatization is defined as the process whereby physical symptoms are experienced in response to stress (Lipowski 1988). Examples include a tension headache or a gastrointestinal symptom (such as abdominal pain, nausea, or diarrhea) that is triggered or exacerbated by a stressful event (such as a school test or a family argument). The most frequently reported symptoms experienced via somatization are pain, gastrointestinal and/or neurological. It is important to recognize that an underlying illness or injury can itself be a significant stressor that triggers or exacerbates somatization. For example, a child with epilepsy might also have non-epileptic seizures, or a child with cancer might get nauseated in anticipation of a hospital admission for chemotherapy.Somatization is not intentional; it is an automatic or habitual physical and behavioral response to stress. While it is possible with training and practice to gain some control over one’s symptoms, somatization is not equivalent to falsifying symptoms (as one might see in malingering or a factitious disorder). Therefore, to simply suggest that one cease somatizing is not helpful.",

Any sudden change in living conditions (family environment, regime) can lead to stuttering.

In women, OCD commonly starts in the early 20s, and is often chronic; thus it coincides with the typical childbearing years for many women and pregnancy and/or birth is a consistently cited triggering factor.1\n\nPerinatal OCD is OCD that occurs in pregnancy or postnatally. It may be a new and sudden onset in those with no previous history or an exacerbation of existing OCD. Symptoms commonly orientate around the baby and caregiving. Pregnancy onset has been more associated with fears of accidentally harming the baby by contamination (for example, ‘my hands may be contaminated’), with related compulsions including excessive washing, restriction of diet and, postnatally, avoidance of activities and contact with others such as playgroups, and minimal child handling, reducing mother–child interaction.

PTSD results in significant distress and morbidity. For example, following an assault a person may experience intrusive thoughts of the assault, suffer from nightmares of threat or assault, or experience flashbacks of all or some portions of the assault. Avoidance of reminders is common and may include, for example, avoidance of the site of the assault or similar places, avoidance of people who are similar to the perpetrator, or avoidance of conversations about community or domestic violence. Following a traumatic event, emotional numbing such as a sense of being unable to have loving feelings, feeling detached from others, or having decreased interest may occur. Difficulty falling asleep, being easily startled, irritability, and hypervigilance are common hyperarousal symptoms (see DSM-IV for criteria) (1).",

Many of these conditions are located to cervical or suboccipital muscles and constitute a separate group in the classification scheme for chronic pain published in Pain (Merskey, 1986). The pain appears to originate in muscles or connective tissue associated with muscle. The aetiology is not known, but parameters indicating a negative emotional state (depression, anxiety), stressful conditions at home or at work (time pressure, emotional conflicts, perceived poor psychosocial work environment) or mechanical stress (posture, repetitive work tasks) are often shown to correlate with the pain condition (Holm et al., 1986; Ellertsen & Kløve, 1987; Kamwendo, Linton & Moritz, 1991; Winkel & Westgaard, 1992).",

      "abstract": "Myotonia dystrophica is a familial disease, transmitted by an autosomal dominant gene with incomplete penetrance and variable expression. It is found most frequently in young adults of both sexes (Thomasen, 1948; Welsh et al., 1964), but can begin from childhood (Dodge et al., 1965). The main symptoms are myotonia, i.e. the continued active contraction of a muscle persisting after the cessation of voluntary effort or stimulation, and weakness and wasting of voluntary muscles. The disease affects mainly the muscles of hands and feet, as well as the facial, ocular and oropharyngeal muscles. The most telling symptom of myotonia is a slowness of relaxation after a forceful contraction such as a handshake. The electromyographic pattern of the involved muscles is characterized by bursts of fibrillation-like potentials, elicited by insertion of the recording needle, by a slight voluntary effort or by muscle percussion (Fig. 200A). Their frequency is high at the beginning and then decreases, giving the characteristic dive-bomber sound in the loudspeaker. The dystrophic process is manifested by the short duration and the weak amplitude of the action potentials, and by the increased number of polyphasic spikes (Dumotjlin and Aucremanne, 1959). Smooth muscles and cardiac muscle are also frequently involved. The esophagus is the most frequently affected gastrointestinal organ; stomach, small intestine, colon and gallbladder are less often abnormal. The muscles of the uterus and of the urinary bladder can also be weakened (Welsh et al., 1964; Schuman et al., 1965; Harvey et al., 1965; Goldberg and Sheft, 1972). Involvement of the internal anal sphincter is characterized by myotonic contraction instead of relaxation after rectal distension (Schuster et al., 1965). On histological examination, lesions of the smooth muscle cells are found whereas the intramural nerve plexuses seem to be intact (Goldberg and Sheft, 1972).",

In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM‐IV‐TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000), SPD is described as a “pervasive pattern of detachment from social relationships and a restricted range of expression of emotions in interpersonal settings, beginning by early adulthood and present in a variety of contexts, as indicated by four (or more) of the following: (1) neither desires nor enjoys close relationships, including being part of a family; (2) almost always chooses solitary activities; (3) has little, if any, interest in having sexual experiences with another person; (4) takes pleasure in few, if any, activities; (5) lacks close friends or confidants other than first‐degree relatives; (6) appears indifferent to the praise or criticism of others; and (7) shows emotional coldness, detachment, or flattened affectivity” (p. 697).",

      "title": "THE PROCESS OF SEPARATION AND INDIVIDUATION AS THE RISK FACTOR IN PSYCHOSOCIAL DEVELOPMENT OF PERSONS WITH PHYSICAL DISABILITIES",
      "abstract": "The process of separation and individuation is a developmental psychological process, which takes place at various phases of child development within his first three years of life. These phases include the Normal Autistic Phase, the Normal Symbiotic Phase, the Separation-Individuation Phase (with sub-phases Differentiation, Practicing and Rapprochement, On the Way to Object Con­stancy) and the Final Separation and Psychological Birth of the Human Infant. Undisturbed transition through the developmental phases leads to the es­tablishment of psychological structure in the hu­man infant, which means that he reaches autonomy and independence, thus becoming an individual. For children which were born with physical dis­abilities and have their intellectual capacities pre­served (i.e. in cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy etc.), the fulfilment of this process is endangered, because their development was stuck at the Nor­mal Symbiotic Phase due to two types of factors. The first group represents factors of physical dis­ability (i.e. impossibility to move, obtain inde­pendent experiences and, consequently, the inabil­ity to detach from the Object), while the second group represents reactions to this hindrance (i.e. overprotection, which further thwarts attempts to detach from the Object).",

      "title": "PSYCHOLOGICAL FEATURES OF AUTO-AGGRESSIVE BEHAVIOR OF ADOLSCENTS",
      "abstract": "There are various external factors that cause feelings, favorable for the formation of suicidal behavior: misunderstanding, meaningful rejection by others, experienced abuse, loneliness, alienation; loss of parental love, love – the key negative emotions are jea-lousy, death, divorce, escape from the family of some of the parents – despair, insult, jealousy; contempt, amazed selfishness – insult, anger, hatred, aggression as a desire to revenge, etc. It has been established that approximately half of examples of suicidal youth behavior are associated with destructive family problems, with a negative attitude towards them.Interpersonal or intrapersonal conflict in the conditions of social, psychological, existential crisis on the background of mental disadaptation can acquire a suicidogenic character. In all cases, the crucial moment in the formation of manifestation of suicidal behavior is precisely a suicidogenic conflict. Adoption of a suicidal decision (regardless of the causes, conditions, forms of maladaptation) occurs only after the phase of personal re-development of suicidogenic conflict.In our study, the group of suicide risk is totally 27.2 %. Researchers from this risk group are less readers of books, play computer games, attend interest groups, but are more on the streets and do their home affairs. They have significantly more problems with their father, mother, brothers and sisters, and their peers. They are mostly dissatisfied with the degree of realization of material and spiritual needs in their family. In the vast majority of high school students of the risk group, there are high levels of anxiety and mental and physical exhaustion, the experience of loneliness, hopelessness, irrationality of existence.In a greater number of senior pupils-licetists a factor of high anxiety was the fear of not meeting the expectations of others. Analysis of the data of the questionnaires of high school students of the risk group allowed to highlight and describe the main variants of individual images of states that can lead to auto-aggressive behavior of young people. The most striking feature is the sense of guilt, which arises as a result of inadequate assessment of one’s own actions or intentions, numerous, often groundless, self-excuse, hyperbolization of their mistakes, impairment of achievements, reproach of conscientiousness, and the desire to get out of life.",

      "title": "Hyperkinetic Movement Disorders",
      "abstract": "The term \"hyperkinetic movement disorders\" encompasses a wide variety of abnormal movements reflective of pathology at several different sites within the nervous system. Tremor is the most common of these movements and is characterized by rhythmic oscillation of a body part. The two most common types of tremor are essential tremor and parkinsonian disease, and these conditions can be distinguished by careful clinical examination. Myoclonus is a brief, shocklike movement of a joint or multiple joints, and is most easily diagnosed by examining for neighborhood signs of neurologic dysfunction. It has a multitude of causes ranging from benign and self-limited to life-threatening. Chorea is an irregular, purposeless, twisting or flowing movement that is often accompanied by athetosis, a slow, purposeless, writhing movement. A limited number of conditions may cause choreoathetosis, the most important of which is the neurodegenerative disorder, Huntington disease. Dystonia is characterized by twisting, repetitive movements, and may lead to torsion or fixation of a body part in a consistent direction. It may be focal or generalized. Myotonia is a disorder of impaired muscle relaxation. The most common causes of myotonia are the multisystem disorder myotonic dystrophy and the more restricted myotonia congenita.",

      "title": "Motion sickness",
      "abstract": "Motion sickness is induced during passive locomotion in vehicles. It is generated either by unfamiliar body accelerations, to which the person has therefore not adapted, or by an intersensory mismatch involving conflicting vestibular and visual stimuli (Dichgans and Brandt 1973, 1978; Benson 1977; Reason 1978; Brandt and Daroff 1980; Crampton 1990). According to the \"mismatch theory\" (see also p. 4), spatial orientation and perception of movement are disturbed by a conflict between stimuli, when the multisensory motion signals do not correspond to the expected pattern of sensory signals established from earlier experience with active locomotion. This may give rise to unpleasant illusions of movement with consequences for posture and vehicle control (Dichgans and Brandt 1978; Leibowitz et al. 1982) and result in motion sickness due to summation. This simple \"sensory conflict\" theory of motion sickness has been questioned by those who argue that there is no principled basis on which this concept can distinguish between nauseogenic and non-nauseogenic stimulus situations (Stoffregen and Riccio 1991; Riccio and Stoffregen 1991).",

      "title": "Onabotulinum Toxin A (Botox) for Spasticity in Patients With Acquired Brain Injury [Internet]",
      "abstract": "Acquired brain injury is an umbrella term that encompasses traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) and non-traumatic brain injuries. Approximately 150,000 Canadians will sustain an ABI on an annual basis. An ABI is damage to the brain that is not due to a congenital or degenerative disorder. Occurring after birth, ABI can be caused by a traumatic event or external force (e.g., motor vehicle accident, sports injury), or a non-traumatic event or internal factor (e.g., infection, tumour). Injury to the brain can result in temporary or permanent physical (e.g., movement issues, spasticity, chronic pain), cognitive (e.g., impaired speech, memory loss), and/or emotional (e.g., depression, anger issues) impairments.As 1 of the major physical impairments resulting from an ABI, muscle spasticity is often described as muscle over-activity and is characterized by ongoing muscle contractions that are partly due to a decrease in skeletal stretch reflex threshold. Occurring spontaneously or continuously, spasticity typically affects muscles in the neck and upper and lower limbs. Spasticity can result in a variety of musculoskeletal issues such as involuntary shaking, joint stiffness, muscle contracture, and limited range of movement. This debilitating condition may limit one’s ability to perform the activities of daily living, impact one’s quality of life, and require additional assistance from caregivers.The treatment of ABI-related spasticity can involve a combination of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions. Non-pharmacological options may include casting and splinting to maintain positioning, stretching and strengthening to improve control of spastic muscles, and/or transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation to help reduce pain. Pharmacological options can be administered systemically (e.g., oral baclofen, tizanidine, clonidine, dantrolene sodium) or locally (e.g., injection of botulinum toxin type A [BoNT-A], phenol, baclofen). Botulinum toxin (BoNT), a neurotoxic protein produced by Clostridium botulinum bacteria, exists in multiple subtypes (i.e., A to G) and formulations.BoNT-A intramuscular injection is used to treat spasticity by inhibiting the release of acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter involved in activating skeletal muscles. BoNT-A injections result in temporary local paresis (i.e., partial paralysis) and may help to improve pain. BoNT-A is approved for various indications (i.e., not exclusive to spasticity), and is available as 3 formulations in North America: onabotulinum toxin A (Botox), abobotulinum toxin A (Dysport), and incobotulinum toxin A (Xeomin). Due to different manufacturing processes and pharmacological activities, these 3 formulations are not considered interchangeable products. This report focuses on onabotulinum toxin A, which will be referred to herein as Botox — its brand name.The body of evidence evaluating treatment options for spasticity after brain injury is limited in quality and quantity, and there is uncertainty regarding the clinical effectiveness of Botox for this population. Another 2021 CADTH rapid review report focused on the use of Botox for the treatment of spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis. The aim of this rapid review report is to summarize and critically appraise the relevant evidence on the clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and evidence-based guidelines regarding the use of Botox for the treatment of ABI-associated spasticity.",

      "title": "How does multiple trauma, traumatic brain injury (TBI) or spinal cord injury (SCI) affect male sexual functioning?",
      "abstract": "Sex is an important part of life for many people, therefore dealing with erectile problems, living with the effects of physical injury, changes in your appearance or side-effects of treatment can have an enormous impact on your sex life and relationships. Normal sexual behaviour and erectile function depends on a complex interaction between various body-systems, including the brain, nerves, blood-supply and hormones. All of these systems (alone or in combination) may be affected following multiple trauma, traumatic brain injury (TBI) or spinal cord injury (SCI). For men, trauma may result in problems with achieving or maintaining erections (commonly referred to as erectile dysfunction; ED), problems with ejaculation, or how they think/feel about sex - all of these problems may have an indirect, if not profound impact on long-term functional recovery and overall quality of life. Following multiple trauma, spinal injury, or TBI, it is not unusual for some men to go through a period of reduced sexual drive (reduced libido). Apart from physical effects of injury, the way the body responds sexually also depends on thoughts and feelings – thoughts and feelings about yourself and others may be influenced by changes in mood, motivation, personality and thought-processes. This may be complicated by depression, emotional trauma following the injury, medication, or changes in hormone levels. As some men grapple with the changes and implications associated with their injury, many may initially ignore the importance of sexual difficulties, as they remain focused on physical rehabilitation and recovery of mobility. Other men may be reluctant to acknowledge sexual difficulties, due to cultural or personal reasons. There are a wide range of treatments and interventions that may be helpful for the man and his partner, which is why assessment of sexual function should be routinely incorporated into rehabilitation and follow-up services for trauma-survivors. The information below describes common sexual problems after TBI, SCI or multiple trauma and ways to improve sexual functioning.",

      "title": "Management of intimate partner abuse",
      "abstract": "Opening Vignette Sarah visited your clinic with her boyfriend for a cough and runny nose. During auscultation, you noticed a few bruises in the shape of a hand and of different ages on her chest, stomach and upper arm. She also appeared timid and avoided any eye contact with you. You asked her about the bruises, and her boyfriend replied that she was careless and fell frequently.WHAT IS INTIMATE PARTNER ABUSE? Intimate partner abuse is when an intimate partner inflicts violent, threatening or controlling behaviour. An intimate partner could be a current or former spouse, or a non-spouse (e.g. boyfriend, girlfriend or dating partner). Intimate partner abuse is broadly categorised into physical, sexual, emotional-psychological, economical, wrongful confinement or social isolation. It can result in direct injuries such as physical injuries and pain, or indirect injuries such as mental disorders, e.g., posttraumatic stress disorder, major depressive disorders, generalised anxiety disorder and decline in functional or cognitive ability, low self-esteem or poor self-care.[1] Intimate partner abuse is the most common form of domestic violence in Singapore. Abuse tends to recur in a repetitive escalating pattern, with many victims not seeking help until much later, if at all. A local survey found that only 23.4% of victims reported a recent abuse incident to the police.[2] Primary care practitioners are often the first point of contact, as victims may present with related injuries or for unrelated medical consultations. They can present for reasons such as acute respiratory infections, chronic disease management or routine health screenings. With a high index of suspicion, physicians can seize these opportunities to detect such cases and enable early intervention before serious injuries or death occurs. WHAT ARE THE RISK FACTORS FOR ABUSE? Individual factors: The perpetrator has a history of substance abuse or interpersonal violence and certain personality traits or psychopathology, such as hostility, jealousy, a suspicious nature, anger-management issues, low self-esteem, high emotional dependency and feeling of depression. He/she may also experience social isolation and have a history of exposure to abuse or a belief in strict gender roles. Relationship factors: These include relationship styles that may contribute to poor communication, conflict-management and problem-solving skills, or the need for power and control. The perpetrator may also have experienced socialisation issues in childhood or a culture of dominance and control by one partner over the other, recent separation between partners, and unhealthy family relationships and interactions. Community factors: These include job loss, economic stress, poverty and its associated issues (e.g., overcrowded housing), and low social capital. Safe management measures imposed during the pandemic may exacerbate the tension between partners in a confined living arrangement. Societal factors: The perpetrator may have patriarchal values, with views that men hold power and dominate in rigid gender roles against women — including men having control over decision-making and limitations to women's independence in public and private life. WHAT ARE THE SIGNS SUGGESTIVE OF ABUSE? Clinicians may suspect possible abuse based on history taking, clinical signs or non-verbal cues. During history taking, if the history given is vague and inconsistent, where explanation for injuries is inadequate or does not match the physical findings, this may be cause for concern. Other hints include a clinical visit that does not address any obvious injuries or significant delays in seeking treatment from the time of injury, or where the patients continually minimise their symptoms. General observations of poor hygiene or malnutrition with decreasing body mass index may also raise red flags. The patient may attempt to hide the injuries with long sleeves, makeup, or cover the neck with hair. During physical examination, suggestive clinical signs include injuries located in unusual areas such as the back, buttocks or ears, patterned injuries such as from a belt or cigarette butts, injuries in multiple areas or multiple injuries of various ages. The patient may give irrelevant answers and excuses for injuries or check in with his/her partner before responding. In addition, non-verbal cues such as the patient being overly submissive or afraid, especially in the presence of the spouse or partner, or a lack of eye contact and avoidance of the spouse or partner are tell-tale signs. The reactions of the spouse or partner, if present, may also give clues. These include the spouse or partner showing incongruent reactions, downplaying or dismissing the symptoms, disallowing the patient to answer questions, or attempting to end the consult prematurely. HOW DO I ELICIT MORE INFORMATION? As patients may not offer abuse as their first presenting complaint, a high index of suspicion is needed. Victims may also minimise or deny their symptoms of abuse. To elicit more information, it is essential to establish a conducive environment for the patient to confide and trust in the doctor. This includes ensuring that the presence of a third party does not interfere with history taking and assessment, and asking the third party to step out if necessary. Direct and sensitive questions can aid in identification of abuse. For instance, physicians may start with a general statement, \"No matter how well people may get along, there are times when they disagree or get annoyed by the other person, or just have spats or fights because they are tired or in a bad mood.\" This can be followed by more detailed questions on whether the spouse or partner has done any of the following: (a) did or said something to spite the patient; (b) threatened to hit or throw something at the patient; (c) threw or smashed something at the patient; (d) pushed, grabbed, slapped, hit, kicked or shoved the patient; (e) threatened to hit other family members of the patient; (f) interacted with the patient in a way that makes him/her live in constant fear; (g) threatened the patient with a weapon; and (h) prevented the patient from contacting his/her extended family, relatives or friends. Screening tools that may be useful include the HITS (Hurt, Insult, Threaten and Scream) questionnaire (consists of only four questions), the Abuse Assessment Screen and the computer-based intimate partner violence questionnaire. Further information on screening tools can be obtained from the recommended readings. Inquiring about the presence of psychiatric illness in the spouse or intimate partner could be considered, as it is a potential risk factor and could have implications on the management of the patient. Special care should be taken when gathering information about suspected abuse. A balance should be struck with the amount of information gathered about the alleged abuse, bearing in mind that each time the patient talks about the alleged abuse, it can be potentially traumatic. Dissociation (e.g. glazed eyes, looking away) is a sign of distress when talking about abuse. The general practitioner can engage the patient in grounding techniques to re-establish a sense of safety and to re-orientate the patient to the present reality. Grounding techniques may include getting the patient to focus on who he/she is and the current location, and asking the patient to name three things that he/she can see, hear or feel in the room. Having a listening ear can be an empowering experience for the patient. The general practitioner should give the patient space to tell his/her story while offering validation and reassurance. It is also important to communicate to the patient that he/she is not at fault. The physician can do so by saying that \"Violence is unacceptable\", but should avoid asking questions such as \"Why did this person hit you?\", or saying anything that may suggest that the patient can control the violence. Patients may also need immediate help to formulate a safety plan, including advanced preparation in case of escalating violence and the need to safely leave the abuser (e.g., list of emergency contact numbers, alternative accommodations, linkup to family social service centres, and advice on making police report and applying for legal protections). WHAT CAN I DO IN MY PRACTICE? Physicians are reminded that the duty of care is to the patients and not to the patients' intimate partners. The management of suspected abuse includes providing appropriate medical care, ensuring protection for the victim if there is a risk of imminent danger, notifying the appropriate authorities and informing the patient of avenues of assistance if needed. Firstly, appropriate medical care should be provided. This may include a referral to the emergency department if medically indicated. A lower threshold can also be applied for suspect cases to enable further investigations such as imaging. In such cases, physician should indicate non-accidental injury in the referral. Secondly, the suspected abuse has to be stopped and the physician can assist the patient to get the help needed to stop the violence. It is useful to understand how the existing legislation framework and protective and personal social services can support these patients. The Women's Charter, Penal Code, Children and Young Persons Act, Mental Capacity Act, Vulnerable Adult Act and Protection from Harassment Act have made provisions for definitions of abusive behaviour, chargeable offences, punishment and deterrence of the abusive behaviour, and provisions for protection of the victims. Protection of the victims come from the following: Personal Protection Order (PPO): This order is issued to the perpetrator and given to the victim to restrain the perpetrator from abusing the victim. If the perpetrator violates the order, he/she can be arrested by the police when the latter is called in. The perpetrator may be concurrently issued a Mandatory Counselling Order together with the PPO to require him/her to attend counselling. Domestic Exclusion Order (DEO): This order is issued to grant the victim exclusive occupation of the shared residence or a specific part of the shared residence to protect him/her from the perpetrator. Expedited Order (EO): If there is imminent danger of domestic violence against the victim at the time of application of PPO, the court can issue an EO to be served on the perpetrator. This is a temporary protection order granted in the absence of the perpetrator, pending the issuance of PPO. Counselling Order, Mandatory Assessment and Treatment Orders: These orders are usually issued to perpetrators to mandate them to receive counselling and treatment. General practitioners should be acquainted with the family service centres (FSCs) in the neighbourhood so that victims of intimate partner abuse can be referred to these centres expeditiously. The FSC social workers can then handhold these patients in the application for these orders either at the court or at the nearest specialist family violence centre, where video linkup with the court for virtual application is available. The FSC can also assist to arrange for crisis shelters for patients who need them. Children in the affected families may also be victims or witnesses of abuse. These experiences can be traumatic for them and hence, it is important to encourage patients to receive assistance from the FSC, if not for themselves (particularly if they show reluctance), then for the sake of their children. Thirdly, medical practitioners are legally required under Section 424 of the Criminal Procedure Code to notify the police in the event of assessment of grievous hurt or high risk of imminent intimate partner violence that might lead to grievous hurt or death. To ensure the safety of the victim, it is recommended that the physician and social worker, in collaboration with the victim, should devise a safety plan to ensure ongoing support for the victim and other vulnerable persons in the family. Importantly, physicians will not be penalised for reporting cases that turn out not to be an abuse case, if there was reasonable suspicion for abuse. General practitioners practising within an institution can follow institutional guidelines for reporting. Otherwise, a police report can be made via the Police Report E-services portal at https://eservices.police.gov.sg/content/policehubhome/homepage/police-report.html. The following details should be clearly documented and included in the report: a description of the injuries sustained (written and/or pictorial description), the circumstances of the incident and the incident location. Finally, if the medical practitioner assesses a risk of potential abuse, but the patient turns down referrals for help, the patient may be discharged from medical follow-up. In such cases, the medical practitioner should still advise victims regarding the available avenues of assistance [Table 1], such as informing them that they can call the police at 999 or seek safe haven at any medical facility or FSC at any point in time, if they are at risk of immediate danger.Table 1: Avenues of assistance for victims of intimate partner abuse.WHAT IF I AM NOT SURE? If the medical practitioner is not certain whether the patient may be a victim of abuse, he/she should consult the National Anti-Violence 24/7 hotline at 1800 777 0000. RECOMMENDED READINGS 'Intimate partner violence: Diagnosis and screening' from UpToDate, by Weil A.[3] Intimate Partner Violence and Sexual Violence Victimization Assessment Instruments for Use in Healthcare Settings: Version 1 by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Injury Prevention and Control.[4] TAKE HOME MESSAGES Primary care providers are one of the first touchpoints of potential abuse cases and can help in early detection and escalation for intervention in these cases. A high index of suspicion is necessary as patients may not offer abuse as the presenting complaint. There are various types of abuse — physical, sexual, emotional-psychological, economical, wrongful confinement or social isolation. Clinical signs suggestive of abuse include injuries that cannot be adequately explained, injuries located in unusual locations, patterned injuries and multiple injuries of various ages. Clinicians can look for non-verbal cues and ask appropriate questions to identify abuse cases. Screening tools that may be useful to identify abuse cases include the HITS questionnaire, the abuse assessment screen and the computer-based intimate partner violence questionnaire. Clinicians have a duty of care to their patients, and not to the patients' intimate partners. Primary care providers should provide patients with adequate medical care or refer them to further medical care. They need to ensure that unclear cases who are discharged are counselled on the avenues for help. Clinicians should know the FSCs in the neighbourhood and refer their patients to the FSCs, if necessary. Medical professionals will not be penalised for reporting cases that turn out not to be an abuse case if there was reasonable suspicion for abuse. Failing to do so is an offence under the Criminal Procedure Code. Clinicians should keep a clear and detailed documentation of the injuries sustained, the circumstances of the injuries and the incident location to aid in subsequent investigations. Closing Vignette You requested for the patient's boyfriend to step out for you to perform a physical examination and managed to obtain a more detailed history. You assessed that Sarah may be a victim of abuse, documented your findings from the physical examination and assessment, and proceeded to treat her injuries. There was no serious bodily harm, and she had already moved back to her parent's home. As there was no immediate danger to the patient's life and she had a safe place to stay, you decided to refer her to the nearby FSC instead of the police. In addition, you provided her with information on the National Anti-Violence Helpline and advised her to make a report of the abuse at the nearest police station.Financial support and sponsorship Nil.

      "abstract": "Within an evolutionary context two subtypes of limbic system dysfunctioning are compared: (1) the previously proposed limbic psychotic trigger reaction, in which nondrive motivated homicide is triggered by a specific individualized external stimulus, which evokes a brief-lasting active reliving of past (moderately) stressful, frequently repeated (“kindled”?) situations. The brief-lasting out-of-character homicidal episode with flat affect is typically associated with first-time formed or unformed hallucinations of various modalities and with overactivation of the autonomic nervous system. There is no (noticeable) loss of consciousness, enabling the patient's full recall (at times with suicidal attempts) (Pontius, 1981, 1984, 1987).

Cerebral palsyaffects two to three children per 1,000 live-born children. Typological characteristics of the clinical image of cerebral palsy are the modified muscle tone characterized by muscular tension, altered body posture and disturbed motion. Cerebral palsy is a disorder of the central nervous system, so it affects the whole development and functioning of the physical psychomotor development of a child. It is accompanied by developmental disorders, sensomotor disorders, perceptual cognitive developmental disorders, socioemocional disorders and difficulties in functioning of everyday life, auditory - visual and other perceptual disorders, intellectual deficit, etc., and may be accompanied by epilepsy. Cerebral palsy, although a permanetn diagnosys, depending on the degree of damage, can be treated using different treatment methods and therapies such as kinesitherapy can which can significantly influence the overall functioning of the affected person. The key precondition is early detection and propercorrective and therapeutic or curative action. Kinesitheraphy as a motion treatment method can have a significant effect on treating a person, raising the body's psychomotor status and the quality of everyday life. Methods used, based on clinical kinesiology, and appropriate exercise and modification, kinesitherapy has positive effects in treating the condition of people with cerebral palsy.",

      "abstract": "Plusieurs considerent le traumatisme crânien comme une « epidemie silencieuse » : « Epidemique » par le nombre eleve de cas, ayant des repercussions socio-economiques importantes ; « silencieuse » car le manque de sensibilisation et de connaissances du phenomene fait que ce probleme passe quasiment inapercu. Le traumatisme craniocerebral (TCC) implique un coup plus ou moins violent a la tete et il peut se produire a divers moments et dans divers lieux : accident de la route ou au travail ou encore lors d'une activite de loisir ou d'une activite sportive. Il y a trois niveaux : le TCC leger, modere et grave. Les deux dernieres categories (TCC modere et grave) impliquent un coma plus ou moins long et le reveil est souvent compare a une deuxieme naissance ou l'on doit tout reapprendre. Souvent, le TCC est caracterise par des sequelles persistantes qui ont la particularite d'etre invisibles. Ainsi, les proches et les ami(e)s et aussi les autres personnes rencontrees peuvent avoir de la difficulte a saisir les changements causes par le TCC ; ceci peut laisser place a de la stigmatisation. Nous avons fait des entretiens semi-diriges avec des personnes ayant survecu a un TCC modere ou grave pour pouvoir les questionner sur leur experience de vie a leur retour a la vie « normale ». Le handicap est le theme central de notre recherche, et a l'aide du modele du Processus de production du handicap (PPH) propose par Fougeyrollas et al. (1998), nous avons observe l'importance du role des facteurs personnels (sequelles) et surtout de l'impact des facteurs environnementaux (famille, ami(e)s, organismes et institutions, etc.) sur la reduction ou l'augmentation des habitudes de vie (situation de handicap). Pour faire la demonstration que la personne ayant survecu a un TCC n'est pas un acteur passif face a sa situation de handicap, nous avons utilise le concept « d'agir » propose par Hurtubise et Roy (2007). Cela a permis d'illustrer les diverses strategies qu'utilise une personne vivant avec un TCC pour faire face aux differents obstacles. Nous avons identifie cinq types d'actions : l'evitement, la paralysie, la contrainte, le bricolage et la tactique. Toutes les personnes de notre recherche n'ont pas fait un retour a leur vie d'avant l'accident mais ils ont tous trouve de nouvelles habitudes de vie adaptees a leur situation ; plusieurs doivent et devront faire face a des obstacles en lien avec le TCC.\r\n______________________________________________________________________________ \r\nMOTS-CLES DE L’AUTEUR : traumatisme crânien, handicap invisible, liminalite, agir, stigmatisation",

In individuals with suicidal intent there is a strong narcissistic component integrated into the personality that is unable to accept defeat or combat reverses. In these individuals the ego becomes befuddled and as a result the libidinal drive is blocked. The result of this is destruction. The manner in which this destruction is carried out depends upon whether someone has wronged the individual or he has wronged himself. When it is the latter the act is generally carried out more or less quietly, whereas when it is the former it is carried out more dramatically and openly.

Psychosis is a combination of biological (genetic, neuroanatomical, neurophysiological), psychological and social factors in various proportions. Psychoses are classified according to their origin (etiology) and reasons (pathogenetic mechanisms of development) into endogenous (including endogenous psychoses include schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, some psychotic forms of affective disorders), organic, somatogenic, psychogenic (reactive, situational), intoxication, withdrawal and post-withdrawal. Most often, psychoses develop in the framework of so-called endogenous disorder. The concepts of psychosis and schizophrenia are often equated, which is incorrect as psychotic disorders can occur in a number of mental illnesses: Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia, chronic alcoholism, drug addiction, epilepsy, intellectual disabilities, etc. Other types of psychosis, such as infectious, somatic and intoxication psychoses are quite often find among patients in non-psychiatric practices.

      "title": "Movement Disorders in Children",
      "abstract": "After completing this article, readers should be able to: Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart, in 1964, while trying to define \"obscenity,\" articulated the now well-known \"I shall not today attempt to define the kinds of material I understand to be embraced … [b]ut I know it when I see it ….\" In some respects, a similar comment can be made about movement disorders. A movement disorder typically is defined as dysfunction in the implementation of appropriate targeting and velocity of intended movements, dysfunction of posture, the presence of abnormal involuntary movements, or the performance of normal-appearing movements at inappropriate or unintended times. The movement abnormalities are not due to weakness or abnormal muscle tone, but may be accompanied by weakness or abnormal toneBy convention, movement disorders are divided into two major categories. The first is hyperkinetic movement disorders, sometimes referred to as dyskinesias. This term refers to abnormal, repetitive involuntary movements and encompasses most of the childhood movement disorders, including tics, chorea/ballismus, dystonia, myoclonus, stereotypies, and tremor. The second category is hypokinetic movement disorders, sometimes referred to as akinetic/rigid disorders. The primary movement disorder in this category is parkinsonism, manifested primarily in adulthood as Parkinson disease or one of many forms of secondary parkinsonism. Hypokinetic disorders are relatively uncommon in children. Although ataxia, weakness, and spasticity are characterized by motor dysfunction, by common convention these entities are not included among \"movement disorders.\" This review focuses on dyskinesias because they represent the bulk of movement disorders in childrenThe components of the central nervous system typically implicated in disorders of movement are the basal ganglia (caudate, putamen, globus pallidus, subthalamic nucleus, substantia nigra) and frontal cortex. The accomplishment of smooth, coordinated movement requires a multifaceted network of brain regions, including basal ganglia and frontal cortex, but also thalamus, cerebellum, spinal cord, peripheral nerve, and muscle. It is important to recognize the multiple components of the nervous system involved in motor control because determining the cause often depends on localizationWhen faced with a movement disorder, the following key questions need to be asked: In clinical practice, the diagnosis of a movement disorder requires a qualitative appreciation of the movement type and context. Abnormal movements can be difficult to define. To classify the disorder phenomenologically, one should describe the characteristics of the movements (Table 1), but even under the best circumstances, movement disorders may be difficult to characterize. Chorea can resemble myoclonus; dystonia can resemble spasticity; and paroxysmal movement disorders such as dystonia and tics may resemble other paroxysmal neurologic problems, namely, seizures. Movements in some contexts may be normal and in others may indicate an underlying pathology. For example, frequent eye blinking can be normal and appropriate in one setting (a sand storm), but excessive in another (tic disorders). Movements that are worrisome for a degenerative disorder in adolescents (myoclonus) may be completely normal in an infant (benign neonatal myoclonus). In this article, we discuss most of the hyperkinetic movement disorders, but focus on tics, chorea, and dystonia. Drug-induced movement disorders, a common entity in childhood, fall under the same classification scheme as the other movement disorders (Table 1), but are considered in this discussion in a separate sectionTics commonly are defined as stereotyped intermittent, sudden, discrete, repetitive movements. Movements that involve skeletal muscle are termed \"motor\" tics; those that involve the diaphragm or laryngeal-pharyngeal muscles, producing a sound, are termed \"phonic\" or \"vocal\" tics. Tics occur many times a day, nearly every day. They typically change anatomic location, frequency, type, complexity, and severity over time. Tics can be classified by mode of manifestation (motor or vocal) and complexity (simple or complex). Motor tics can be classified further by speed and quality as clonic (abrupt and fast) or dystonic/tonic (slow and sustained). Simple motor tics include blinking, nose twitching, grimacing, neck jerking, shoulder elevation, sustained eye closure, gaze shifts, bruxism, and abdominal tensing. Simple vocal tics include sniffing, throat clearing, grunting, squeaking, humming, coughing, blowing, and sucking sounds. Complex tics appear more \"purposeful\" than simple tics and may include combinations of movements of multiple body parts. Examples are head shaking, trunk flexion, scratching, touching, finger tapping, hitting, jumping, kicking, and gestures (obscene gestures are termed copropraxia). Complex vocal tics can encompass spoken syllables words or phrases; shouting of obscenities or profanities (coprolalia); repetition of the words of others (echolalia); and repetition of the final syllable, word, or phrase of one's own words (palillalia)The definition of tic disorders can be guided by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV) classification scheme. The primary distinctions are between transient and chronic tic disorders and between chronic motor tic disorder and Tourette syndrome (TS) (Table 2). Transient tic disorder is a disorder of childhood in which one or several tics are indistinguishable from the tics of chronic tic disorder, but the condition lasts only several months. These frequently are interpreted as allergic manifestations. The most common chronic tic disorder is TS, manifested as chronic motor and vocal tics of greater than 1 year's duration with onset prior to age 18 years. Chronic motor tic disorder is characterized by motor tics for more than 1 year, but no vocal tics. Chronic vocal tic disorder is uncommonRecent studies show the prevalence of tics to be approximately 20% of the population and the rate of chronic tic disorders to be about 3% among children. (The discrepancy between prevalence of tics and rate of chronic tic disorders is likely accounted for by transient tic disorders.) Thus, tics and tic disorders are at least one order of magnitude more common than was thought just 15 years ago. From the earliest descriptions, tic disorders have been recognized as having a familial inheritance pattern and a greater prevalence among males. The specific genetic inheritance is being investigated in ongoing research, but a reasonable description of the pattern is autosomal dominant, with incomplete and gender-biased penetration (male:female ratio of 3:1)Tics usually appear in the first decade of life, with a median age of onset of about 6 to 7 years. They have been reported at 2 years of age, but may occur earlier. In most children (96%), tics present before age 11. The most common presenting tic is eye blinking. Vocal tics are the presenting symptom in up to one third of individuals, with the most common initial tics being sniffing or throat clearing. Typically, vocal tics emerge later than motor tics, with a median onset of around 8 to 10 years of age. The most common course is for tics to worsen, with peak severity occurring around 10 to 12 years of age. By age 18 years, approximately 50% of chronic tic disorder patients are tic-free. Tic severity in childhood does not predict adult severity; tic severity rarely is greater in adulthood than in childhoodTics frequently are preceded by a premonitory sensation or urge, and performance of the tic usually is followed by a sense of relief. The common occurrence of eye blinking, sniffing, and throat clearing tics preceded by the sensation of an itch leads to the frequent misdiagnosis of tics as allergic symptoms. For some patients, the premonitory urge is manifested nonspecifically as a sense of anxiety. This sense of anxiety seems particularly true in younger children, perhaps because they are unable to characterize the feeling. Younger children are less likely to describe premonitory urges. For some patients, the premonitory urge may create greater morbidity than the tic itself and, therefore, represents the reason to treat. The premonitory urge has been compared with a compulsive urge, but the latter is believed to have a more cognitive component (ie, \"If I don't wash my hands, I will get sick.\")Some individuals can suppress tics for limited periods of time. The ability to suppress tics sets tic disorders apart from most other movement disorders. However, younger children are less likely to be able to suppress tics, making this point of differentiation less useful in that population. Voluntary tic suppression often is at a cost of rising anxiety or discomfort and usually requires such active concentration that it may prevent the patient from attending to other tasks. Thus, voluntary suppression is not a useful strategy for managing ticsA hallmark of tics is variable severity over time. Tics tend to occur in bouts, with interspersed periods of quiescence. Often a pre-existing tic abates as a new tic emerges. Tics tend to wax and wane over weeks to months. Tic severity seems to be modulated by environmental stimuli, stress, intercurrent infection, and poor sleep. Children commonly experience exacerbations of tics at the outset of the school year and at the time of return from school holidays. Tics also may increase during relaxation after a period of stress. Tics typically disappear with sleep, but in some individuals they persist during all stages of sleepIn addition to tics, patients who have tic disorders may have a number of comorbid behavioral symptoms (FigureF1). These include symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), obsessive-compulsive behaviors or frank obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), anxiety disorders, mood disorders, learning disorders, sleep disorders, conduct and oppositional behavior, and self-injurious behavior. Zinner has discussed these conditions and their treatments in detail (see Suggested Reading). Recent evidence suggests that explosive outbursts or rage attacks are common among children who have TS, occurring in roughly 25%. When affected children have explosive outbursts, they also are more likely to have other comorbid features, such as ADHD, OCD, and oppositional defiant disorder. An important feature of comorbid symptomatology is that certain medications are effective for some symptoms but not for others. For example, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may be beneficial for OCD or anxiety, but they are not effective for tics or ADHD and might be associated with worsened rage controlWhen considering the differential diagnosis of tics, both cause and classification must be addressed. As noted previously, tics are protean in their manifestation. Clonic tics can resemble movements seen in myoclonus, chorea, and seizures. Dystonic tics can resemble the movements seen in primary dystonias. Tonic tics can resemble muscle spasms and cramps. Complex motor tics can be very difficult to discern from mannerisms, stereotypies, restless legs, complex partial or supplementary motor seizures, and akathisia (an inability to sit still due to an uncomfortable sensation of motor restlessness). Most individuals who have tics have a primary tic disorder. Transient tic disorder is the most common; TS is the second most common. Secondary tic disorders do exist, but they are uncommon. In secondary tic disorders, other signs and symptoms are present and distract from the consideration of a primary tic disorder (Table 3)An interesting but unproven autoimmune mechanism for tics and TS (and OCD) has been postulated. The best-known concept is that of pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated with streptococcal infection (PANDAS). The hypothesis that an antecedent group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal (GABHS) infection could result in a neuropsychiatric manifestation such as TS, OCD, or both is conceptually based on Sydenham chorea, a recognized neuropsychiatric manifestation of acute rheumatic fever (ARF). The postulated PANDAS subgroup has been described as having the following characteristics: presence of OCD/chronic tic disorder, prepubertal onset, episodic course with acute and severe onset and explosive exacerbations, neurologic abnormalities other than chorea during the exacerbations, and a documented temporal relationship between GABHS infections and the episodic exacerbations. Whether patients whose TS (and OCD) manifestations appear to be triggered by streptococcal infections can be distinguished clearly from the entire population remains unclear. For this reason, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is sponsoring a prospective multicenter epidemiologic study to ascertain whether a PANDAS subgroup of TS and OCD patients exists.Intense interest in the idea of PANDAS has led to small experimental trials of antibiotic prophylaxis and immunomodulation with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) with or without plasma exchange. At present, these interventions have not been proven effective. Indeed, in July 2000, the National Institute of Mental Health released a statement (http://www.nimh.nih.gov/events/pandaalert.cfm) that treatment of PANDAS, TS, or OCD with IVIG or plasma exchange is considered experimental and that these interventions should be used only in NIH-approved research protocols. Therefore, for patients whose tics appear to be exacerbated by GABHS infections, we recommend that: Antibiotic prophylaxis be reserved for patients who have ARFMost children who have tics have a primary tic disorder, and diagnosis is based on history plus normal findings on neurologic examination aside from tics. Imaging, laboratory studies, and measurement of antibodies to GABHS are not indicated. Individuals who have other neurologic abnormalities or developmental abnormalities deserve further evaluation and should be referred to a neurologistThe primary question when considering treatment of tics is whether the patient has sufficient morbidity to warrant pharmacologic treatment. Reassurance that tics are a common feature on the landscape of human behaviors that (typically) cause no injury and frequently are transient can successfully bypass the desire to start medication. Anticipatory guidance and education for parents, siblings, and teachers can aid immeasurably in preventing the initiation of medications. One important component of anticipatory guidance is recognition of the natural history of tic disorders. For example, for a significant proportion of patients, tics peak in severity at ages 10 to 13 years and diminish substantially in the late teenage years. For many individuals, the tics become so mild by adulthood that they no longer are noticed or may abate completely. Most patients who have uncomplicated tic disorders do well without pharmacologic intervention. However, the symptoms cause sufficient morbidity for some patients to warrant consideration of medicationZinner recently reviewed therapeutic considerations of pharmacotherapy for this publication (see Suggested Reading). If the patient has tics alone, we recommend starting treatment with an alpha-2-adrenergic agonist such as clonidine or guanfacine. Guanfacine may be less sedating than clonidine, but it also may be less effective. Neuroleptics, both typical and atypical, are effective for tics. Good evidence supports the use of typical neuroleptics such as haloperidol and pimozide, but adverse effects frequently are limiting. Atypical neuroleptics such as risperidone appear to be effective for tics and impulsivity and are less likely to cause extrapyramidal adverse effects, but they still have significant morbidity in the form of weight gain and diabetes mellitus. A newer atypical neuroleptic, ziprasidone, shows promise as an anti-tic medication, and early experience suggests that it may not cause weight gain or diabetes mellitus. In addition to medications, behavioral therapies may be helpful. The clinician should determine the relative burden imposed by tics and any comorbidities. For example, if OCD is the primary problem and tics are mild, pharmacotherapy should target the OCD. The incidence of comorbidities is significant. Across series, an average of approximately 50% of individuals who have TS have ADHD, 50% have OCD, 20% have a mood disorder, and 20% have anxiety disorderAccording to the Physician's Desk Reference, methylphenidate is contraindicated \"in patients with motor tics or with a family history or diagnosis of Tourette syndrome.\" This statement apparently is based on a number of case reports and retrospective series that probably have not considered that ADHD is present in approximately 50% of all patients who have TS and that the natural history in these patients is for ADHD symptoms to tend to precede the onset of tics. The basis for the PDR listing is a good example of the shortfalls of anecdotal and retrospective analysis. Several recent studies have indicated that stimulant medications typically do not exacerbate tics, and if they do, the exacerbation usually is transient. However, most prescribing physicians, by stating the warning in the PDR in the discussion of risks and benefits of treating with stimulants, prime parents to anticipate tics. When tics emerge or worsen (tic disorders likely wax and wane independent of medication) in the presence of stimulants, the medication is considered the culprit.A recent study by the Tourette Syndrome Study Group addressed this issue in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study to assess the efficacy of methylphenidate and clonidine individually or in combination for treatment of ADHD among children who had chronic tics or TS. The study provided solid evidence that methylphenidate, if anything, lessens tic severity. The study concluded, \"Prior recommendations to avoid methylphenidate in these children because of concerns of worsening tics are unsupported by this trial.\" Whether these results can be generalized to other stimulants (such as pemoline and dextroamphetamines) is not knownChorea is characterized by frequent, brief, unpredictable, purposeless movements that tend to flow from body part to body part chaotically and unpredictably. The movements of chorea are more chaotic and less brief and \"shocklike\" than myoclonus. They are briefer than the sustained contractions of dystonia. When of low amplitude, chorea may cause the appearance of fidgeting, but when they are of large amplitude, chorea can involve dramatic, flinging limb movements. When the amplitude is very large, the term ballismus often is used. Choreic movements can be sudden and jerky or continuous and flowing. In the latter case, the term choreoathetosis is used. In current parlance, the term \"choreiform\" frequently is used to describe the minimal twitching or \"piano playing\" movements seen in many normal young children when arms are extended during the neurologic examination. We do not find the term \"choreiform\" to be useful because historically its usage has meant \"chorea.\" Instead, we prefer the descriptive term \"minimal chorea.\"Chorea can be classified by cause into primary and secondary disorders. Primary chorea, which is uncommon in childhood, can be caused by benign familial (hereditary) chorea and Huntington disease. Huntington disease rarely presents in childhood with chorea; juvenile-onset Huntington disease usually is characterized by parkinsonism and dystonia. Most chorea in childhood is secondary. More than 100 causes of secondary chorea have been identified, but usually chorea is not the only sign or symptom. The most common cause of chorea in childhood is ARF. Other important causes include systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), pregnancy (chorea gravidarum), vascular disorders, drug ingestion, hyperthyroidism, infection, inflammation, cardiac surgery (\"post-pump chorea\"), degenerative disorders, disorders of intermediary metabolism, and perinatal hypoxia-ischemia (Table 4). A diagnostic strategy based on the more likely causes, with an emphasis on treatable causes, is shown in Table 5Chorea is one of the major Jones criteria for diagnosing ARF. In fact, the presence of chorea without any other criteria is sufficient to make the diagnosis. Although it is widely accepted that chorea can follow GABHS infection, it can be difficult to demonstrate the antecedent infection. Depending on the series, 10% to 40% of children who have ARF have chorea. Sydenham chorea (SC) is most common in children ages 5 to 15 years. There is a 2:1 female predominance after 10 years of age. SC begins several weeks to several months after a GABHS infection. The onset of symptoms usually is insidious, with gradually progressive clumsiness and behavior change, usually accompanied by emotional lability. After a week or more, choreic movements become more obvious and typically become generalized. There frequently is asymmetry, and in some cases, the chorea can be unilateral. Hypotonia and dysarthria commonly accompany the chorea. Behavioral changes may be striking and include impulsivity, aggression, and obsessive-compulsive behaviors. The typical natural history of SC is weeks to months of a waxing and waning course, with ultimate resolution of the chorea. Some individuals have behavioral changes that persist for months. Relapse(s) can occur with or without subsequent GABHS infection, and an increased risk of relapse is associated with pregnancy (chorea gravidarum) or oral contraceptivesThe diagnosis of SC is based on clinical history and can be supported by laboratory data. However, laboratory data should not be viewed as confirmatory. Most affected children have positive serology (antistreptolysin O and antiDNase B antibodies) for GABHS, but more than 25% are serologically negative. Most children who have SC have negative throat cultures for GABHS. Magnetic resonance imaging may show signal abnormalities in the basal ganglia, but diagnostically this technique is neither sensitive nor specific for SC. The presence of carditis or other manifestations of ARF supports the diagnosis of SC. Every child believed to have SC should be evaluated for rheumatic heart disease. Depending on the series, 40% to 75% of children who have SC have carditis. Arthritis is less commonTreatment of SC depends on the impairment or disability associated with the chorea. In many cases, the chorea causes only mild disability, and symptomatic treatment is not required because SC is usually self-limited. When symptomatic treatment is desired, antiepileptic medications such as carbamazepine or valproate can be effective and usually associated with fewer adverse effects than phenothiazines or butyrophenones. Benzodiazepines also may be beneficial. Symptomatic treatment for 2 to 4 months generally is sufficient. Some authors have advocated the use of corticosteroids, IVIG, or plasma exchange based on the presumed autoimmune cause, but there has been no study of long-term outcome of these treatments compared with placeboPenicillin prophylaxis to prevent repeated bouts of GABHS is recommended and described in detail by Dajani et al (see Suggested Reading)Chorea is an uncommon manifestation of SLE, but it can be the presenting symptom. When chorea is the sole manifestation of SLE, it can remain so for years. Although fewer than 10% of children who have SLE have chorea, about 50% of individuals who have chorea due to SLE are younger than 16 years of age. The presence of neurologic manifestations such as chorea in SLE conveys a less favorable prognosis. The diagnosis and treatment of SLE are beyond the scope of this review. When chorea is due to SLE, treatment of the underlying SLE is indicated. Additional symptomatic treatment of the chorea may be indicated if the condition is bothersome. Haloperidol has been reported to be effective for SLE chorea, but the other treatments described previously for SC also may be effectiveDystonia is a syndrome of sustained muscle contractions, frequently causing twisting and repetitive movements or abnormal postures. There are several classification schemes for dystonia, based on age of onset, cause, or body part affected (Table 6). Primary dystonias are those disorders in which dystonia is the only feature or the primary feature, are accompanied only by other movement disorders, and have a specific causative genetic mutation or unknown cause. Secondary dystonias are those disorders in which the dystonia is due to another identifiable cause. Focal dystonia occurs when a single body part is affected. Almost any part of the body can be affected. Examples of focal dystonia include torticollis and writer's cramp. Segmental dystonia refers to involvement of more than one adjacent body part; multifocal dystonia is involvement of multiple nonadjacent body parts. Hemidystonia affects only one side of the body, and generalized dystonia involves the entire body. Note that these classification schemes are overlapping. For example, childhood-onset primary dystonia frequently starts in the lower extremities, trunk, or arms and most commonly progresses to generalized involvement, with involuntary twisting of nearly all parts of the body. Adult-onset primary dystonias more typically are focal or segmentalThere are several characteristic clinical features of dystonia. Stress exacerbates most forms of dystonia. Dystonia commonly is triggered or exacerbated by attempted voluntary movement and may fluctuate in presence and severity over time. Dystonic contractions resolve during sleep. The dystonic posturing may occur only with selected movements and paradoxically not with others that may use the same muscles. For example, walking forward may elicit severe lower extremity and truncal twisting, yet walking backward, running, or swimming may be completely normal. Individuals who have dystonia often find that touching one part of the body relieves the dystonic spasms; this phenomenon is called a sensory trick or geste antagoniste. For example, rubbing the back of the hand may diminish writer's crampHistorically, dystonia has been divided into primary (idiopathic) and secondary causes. A full discussion of the many causes of dystonia is beyond the scope of this review. The two most important types of primary dystonia in children are dopa-responsive dystonia and idiopathic torsion dystonia associated with the DYT1 mutation. The most important causes of secondary dystonia in children are listed in Table 7Dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD) is the most common cause of primary dystonia with onset in childhood. This syndrome is characterized by childhood-onset, progressive dystonia that has a sustained, dramatic response to low doses of levodopa. DRD is also known as hereditary progressive dystonia with diurnal fluctuations or Segawa syndrome. DRD typically presents with a gait disturbance due to foot dystonia starting between 1 and 12 years of age. In untreated older children, diurnal fluctuation may develop, with worsening of symptoms toward the end of the day and marked improvement in the morning. The diurnal fluctuation need not be a presenting feature. In late adolescence or early adulthood, features of parkinsonism can develop. There are two major forms of DRD: a more common autosomal dominant form due to deficiency of GTP cyclohydrolase and a relatively uncommon autosomal recessive form caused by a deficiency in tyrosine hydroxylase. Both forms produce dopamine deficiency without loss of nigrostriatal dopamine neurons. A few clinical differences may help distinguish the two deficiencies, but these are neither sensitive nor specific. DRD due to tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency can be distinguished from GTP cyclohydrolase deficiency by measuring cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) catecholamines, their metabolites, and pterins. In practice, the exquisite response to levodopa generally is sufficient for the diagnosis of DRD. In some cases, a specific diagnosis for the purpose of genetic counseling or in atypical cases may warrant CSF investigations. Although the locus for GTP cyclohydrolase is known, the variability in the genetic defect is sufficiently great for genetic testing not to be routinely availableIt is important to recognize the entity of DRD because it responds dramatically to low doses of levodopa. DRD frequently is misdiagnosed as cerebral palsy, particularly spastic diplegia, so it is important to develop an index of suspicion for DRD in children who have motor impairment, prominent dystonia, and a slowly progressive rather than static course. With appropriate diagnosis and treatment, affected children can lead normal livesChildhood-onset idiopathic torsion dystonia, formerly known as dystonia musculorum deformans, is an autosomal dominant condition that has incomplete (30%) penetrance. Genetic studies have found that a GAG deletion at the DYT1 locus on chromosome 9 causes most autosomal dominant, early-onset primary generalized dystonia affecting Ashkenazi Jewish families (90%) and nonJews (50% to 60%). In childhood-onset idiopathic torsion dystonia, symptoms usually begin in a limb at a mean onset age of 12.5 years. Onset usually is before 28 years of age, but seldom before age 6 years. The legs generally are affected before the arms, and symptoms typically become generalized within 5 years. Diagnosis is based on identifying a GAG deletion in the DYT1 gene; genetic testing is available commerciallyMost types of dystonia are difficult to treat, and often the response is incomplete. The clear exception is DRD, which responds dramatically to low doses of levodopa. For this reason, a trial of levodopa is recommended for all children who have primary dystonia. Because some secondary dystonias also may respond to levodopa, a trial of the drug is recommended for any child in whom dysto",

This spread of electrical activity is critical for coupling the local synaptic depolarization at the neuromuscular junction to the release of intracellular calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Several primary and secondary disorders of skeletal muscle are associated with abnormal excitability. An increase in sarcolemmal excitability manifests as a tendency for the autonomous generation of repetitive action potentials, persistent contraction and delayed relaxation, the hallmarks of myotonia. By contrast, intermittent failure of muscle membrane excitability causes paroxysmal weakness or paralysis that is characteristic of periodic paralysis. These alterations in muscle excitability produce a spectrum of clinical syndromes in which a patient may have myotonia, periodic paralysis, or a combination of both (Fig. 71.1).",

If the initial seizure discharge is related to the motor strip then one might see a Jacksonian type of seizure with first clonic movements of the thumb and fingers, then a march up the hand, arm, face and leg on the contralateral side of the body. If the initial seizure discharge is related to the temporal lobe then one might see impairment of consciousness and automatic movements (automatisms). The \"aura\" is actually the start of the electrical seizure discharge which is confined to one area of brain. The type of \"aura\" that a patient has is related to the area of brain involved in the seizure discharge. For example, the olfactory aura of an unusual smell may be related to a mesial temporal lobe or mesial frontal lobe discharge. The aura of an unusual taste is related to a discharge in the insular cortex. If the electrical seizure discharge spreads out to involve other areas of brain or the whole brain then the patient has a secondarily generalized major motor seizure. The important point is to recognize that the seizure was a partial onset seizure becoming secondarily generalized and therefore due to a focal etiology rather than a primary generalized seizure disorder, which affects a particular area of brain which is may be precipitated in response to some stimuli which effects a particular area of brain which is extraordinarily sensitive because of an epileptic lesion in that area.

      "abstract": "Introducao: A distonia e uma sindrome de contracoes musculares sustentadas involuntarias que produzem sempre movimentos repetitivos e contorcidos ou posturas anormais. Dentre todos os disturbios do movimento associados a disfuncao dos nucleos da base, a distonia e a menos compreendida em relacao a sua fisiopatologia. Recentestrabalhos revelaram que o circuito motor nucleos da base cortico-estriado-talamocortical apresenta um importante papel nas funcoes cognitivas nao-motoras, particularmente na discriminacao temporal e espacial e na integracao multisensorial. O limiar de discriminacao espacial foi encontrado anormal em pacientes com distonia focal nas maos, distonia cervical e blefaroespasmo. Um fenomeno distinto em distonia e o truque sensorial (ou geste antagonistique). Os truques sensoriais sao geralmentemanobras tateis ou de outra natureza sensorial envolvendo o lado afetado ou nao, que reduzem os movimentos e posturas distonicas. O espasmo hemifacial e uma doenca neurologica com caracteristicas fenomenologicas semelhantes a distonia, porem o espasmo hemifacial e uma forma de mioclonia de origem periferica com contracoesmusculares involuntarias e unilateriais clonicas e tonicas dos musculos inervados pelo nervo facial ipsilateral. Objetivo: verificar a frequencia e a caracterizacao clinica dos truques sensoriais em diferentes tipos de distonia e no espasmo hemifacial, bem como determinar mudancas na sensibilidade espacial durante a realizacao do Grating Orientation Task e correlaciona-las com os truques sensoriais. Amostra e metodos: Osvoluntarios foram recrutados da Clinica Disturbios do Movimento - Ambulatorio Bias Fortes UFMG. Participaram da pesquisa individuos de ambos os sexos, diagnosticados com distonia (exceto a distonia heredo-degenerativa) do tipo blefaroespasmo (n=20), distonia cervical (21) e caibra do escrivao (10) ou espasmo hemifacial (26). Osvoluntarios foram avaliados por uma estudante de mestrado que aplicou um questionario e o Mini Exame do Estado Mental, bem como avaliou a sensibilidade espacial atraves do Grating Orientation Task. Resultados: A presenca do truque sensorial foi maior na distonia cervical (81%) quando comparada ao grupo espasmo hemifacial (38,5%) p= 0,004 e ao grupo câimbra do escrivao (20%), p= 0,001. A sensibilidade espacial da mao dominante dos sujeitos que apresentam o truque sensorial foi significativamente maior que daqueles sujeitos que nao apresentam otruque sensorial (p=0,019;p<0,050). Conclusoes: Mais de 1/3 dos pacientes com espasmo hemifacial apresentaram truque sensorial. Truques sao mais comuns na distonia cervical (81%) quando comparada ao grupo espasmo hemifacial (38,5%) e aogrupo caibra do escrivao (20%). Truques sensoriais sao mais comuns em pacientes com deficits de sensibilidade espacial.",

      "abstract": "A recently proposed diagnostic class, psychotic trigger reaction, is deduced from careful clinical studies of eight white men, who upon a very specific trigger stimulus committed murder or attempted to (and in one case also rape). The new class is defined as a sudden ego-alien, motiveless (at least with respect to aggression), motor-wise well organized, violent complex action without emotional concomitants. The action is evoked (not provoked) by an individually unique stimulus within a specific context reviving repeated past traumatic experience. Typically there is no (significant) loss of consciousness and practically full recall. Observed are first-time hallucinations (visual, auditory, tactile, somesthetic, but not olfactory as in temporal lobe epilepsy) and signs of imbalance in the autonomic nervous system (loss of bladder control, ejaculation, profuse sweating, nausea). Only four of these men had previous psychiatric diagnoses (and then various ones) or abnormal EEGs at some time in their lives. Variety in prior diagnoses would be consistent with a seizure-like disorder, here specifically implicating an imbalance in functioning between limbic and frontal lobe systems. Clinical tests for the latter were prevailingly indicative of dysfunctioning. A detailed clinical analysis of the violent acts within their context suggests behaviors are analogous to certain limbic system mechanisms, especially the kindling phenomenon.",

The presence of abnormal behavior is often construed as a marker for ill being, indicating some adverse exposure to psychosocial stress. Abnormal behavior is any pattern of activity that differs from some standard. The ethological standard focuses on species-typical behaviors that have been shaped by natural selection. Abnormal behavior patterns are classified into four broad categories: stereotypic behaviors, which include locomotor, mouth-directed, and body-directed activities; dangerous self-directed behaviors that can cause tissue damage; affective behaviors indicative of abnormal mood states; and displacement activities. An association between painful disorders and the development of abnormal behavior has been noted in some animals.",

      "title": "Functional neuroimaging: the adaptive mechanisms in migraine",
      "abstract": "Migraine is a common neurological disorder characterized by a primary brain dysfunction subtended by an episodic activation and sensitization of the trigemino-vascular pain pathway. Although migraine attacks are clinically welldefined, the underlying pathophysiology of the more complex migraine scenario is largely unknown. Functional brain changes, that occur because of repeated migraine attacks, may be explained through a maladaptive feedforward allostatic cascade model. The fundamental assumption is that “the brain is a central organ of stress” [1], able to detect stressful or potentially stressful situations and react in form of behavioural and/or physiologic responses. These brain responses, mediated by the autonomic nervous system and neuroendocrine mechanisms, could be either adaptive or maladaptive. In this context, allostasis is the ability to protect the body through adaptation [2]. Contrariwise, the allostatic load and overload, resulting from repeated stress and/or allostasis [3], refers to the wear and tear on the systems that normally support adaptation. Compelling evidence suggests that the brain of migraine patients is significantly different from healthy controls. Some of these differences are related to abnormal cortical activity during painful stimulations, suggesting an “adaptive” response observed in the course of moderate or high noxious trigeminal stimulations. Conversely, other differences relate to abnormality in responses that should be adaptive but become impaired or maladaptive, such as altered brainstem processing. More recently, a decreased functional connectivity was demonstrated within the fronto-parietal network (FPN) in patients with migraine without and with aura in the absence of clinically relevant executive deficits. FPN represents the neural substrate of executive functions and FPN functional abnormalities might be a part of a complex cascade that terminates in a migraine attack. Specifically, FPN functional connectivity changes could underlie a defective executive functioning in which high-demanding conditions cannot be correctly processed and solved by patients with migraine, escalating the brain adaptive response, likely resulting in a risk factor for headache attacks. In conclusion, we believe that in migraine an internal state of dysregulation creates an allostatic load with maladaptive consequences on brain, behaviour, physiological regulation and systemic physiology that progress in a feedforward cascade. Thus, we suggest that migraine should be considered a brain disease and not simply a recurrent acute pain syndrome.",

      "abstract": "The cognitive system is structured from sets of schema, patterns of neural activity that allow the assimilation or accommodation of new experiences and so, by a process of consolidation, the gradual development of knowledge and understanding. As well as schema for purely cognitive processes, there are similar structures that enable individuals to deal with sexual behaviour and affectual relationships (e.g. hedonia, self-esteem, personal preferences and body image). In depression, there is a well established disruption of cognitive function that results in anhedonia and a loss of pleasure, including that from sexual activities. Many antidepressants also have a direct pharmacological action on the central nervous system and disrupt cognitive function, so increasing anhedonia and impairing sexual function. Drug actions on cognitive structures, which in turn increase anhedonia and reduce sexual libido, are over and above any direct pharmacological effects on the more overt behavioural activities associated with sex, including orgasm, erectile function, potency and ejaculation. The tricyclic antidepressants, for example, destroy the cognitive structures that are vital to maintain normal libido as well as disturbing overt sexual behaviours. Some selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs; paroxetine and sertraline) are associated with behavioural activation that is also responsible for an impairment of sexual function. However, there are clear differences between the SSRIs, and fluvoxamine (relative to the other SSRIs) has little effect on objective measures of cognition or on cerebral and behavioural components of Sexual function.",

      "title": "Transient Ischemic Attacks",
      "abstract": "FigureDiagnosing transient ischemic attack is not always simple or straightforward. History may help, as with many entities, but then again, it might not. A patient whose arm was numb, swollen, limp, or “dead” earlier might have actually had a motor problem. Onset of neurologic deficit is generally sudden, and deficits are typically of short duration (less than 30 minutes). Involvement of different body parts affected in succession is more characteristic of migraine or seizure. Preceding seizure may cause a post-ictal (Todd's) paralysis. One paper listed signs and symptoms likely not due to TIA: loss of consciousness, vague weakness or dizziness, mental confusion, and incontinence of urine and feces. (Lancet 1992;339:402.) Similarly, vertigo, diplopia, loss of balance, tinnitus, sensory symptoms confined to part of one limb or the face, drop attacks, and amnesia, all in isolation, are unlikely to be caused by TIA. Symptoms from multiple sclerosis typically last longer, and may be characterized by different neurologic manifestations at different times. (Ann Emerg Med 2004;43:592.) How Much Work-up is Necessary? A few remarks on definitions for a moment: The classic definition of a transient ischemic attack entails a focal neurologic symptom lasting less than 24 hours, resulting from a transient decrease in blood supply making the brain ischemic in the area producing the symptom. With advances in neuroimaging, however, especially diffusion-weighted imaging on magnetic resonance imaging, it is possible to identify ischemic brain injury very early. The classic TIA implies restoration of blood flow in a timely enough way to avoid infarction. Transient neurologic symptoms lasting for more than an hour usually imply that some sort of infarction has set in, and these events should not be considered TIAs. Switching from the classic definition to a tissue-based definition would decrease the annual incidence of TIA by approximately 33 percent and increase the annual incidence of stroke by approximately seven percent. (Stroke 2003;34:919.) Diffusion-weighted imaging has the advantage of distinguishing acute infarction from chronic lesions. Some of these are very small; the mean infarct volume detected in TIA patients was less than 1 mL in one report. In fact, this has led some to distinguish transient symptoms with infarction (TSI) from transient symptoms without infarction. (Ann Neurol 2005;57:679.) Clinical TIA duration may not correlate with signal changes on diffusion-weighted imaging. Back to Basics: Why the Hurry? It doesn't make sense to perform expensive tests for an entity that has no emergency treatment and that depends on the results of these tests. (“My back has been killing me for three years. I want an MRI to see what it is once and for all.”) Certainly, it makes sense to put patients on warfarin who have atrial fibrillation to prevent stroke, and an EKG is not a time-consuming or expensive test. Symptomatic patients with greater than 70 percent carotid stenosis, on the other hand, may well derive benefit from endarterectomy. Should all patients be admitted? This is probably the question of the hour for the emergency physician. A debate on this topic appeared in Stroke. (2006;37:1137.) As noted last month, the risk of stroke may be 10 percent to 20 percent in the 90 days after TIA. Perhaps half of the risk of early stroke accrues in the first two days after TIA, however. This is hardly enough time to expect a timely outpatient work-up by a neurologist or a patient's primary care provider. Potential benefits for hospitalization include expedited work-up, opportunity for risk factor modification, monitoring patients for deterioration and possible thrombolysis and especially facilitation of early carotid artery revascularization. Carotid surgery has been shown to be most effective when performed within two weeks of the index ischemic event. (Lancet 2004;363:915.) As for medical therapy with antiplatelet agents (aspirin, clopidogrel) or a statin, studies to be published soon may shed some light on their efficacy in the hyperacute state after TIA or minor stroke. For patients with atrial fibrillation and TIA, the rate of stroke appears to be approximately five percent in the first two to four weeks, a figure that may not be affected by anticoagulation. (Stroke 2002;33:2722.) There is some evidence that patients with motor or speech deficits of less than 10 minutes' duration, who are over 60, or who have diabetes are at higher risk for early stroke. Clinical risk stratification models for TIA have been developed and are used in some settings. (Stroke 2006;37:1137.) Sending Some Patients Home As with other disease entities, it is useful to confirm the diagnosis of TIA, identify and treat the cause, and especially prevent a disabling or fatal vascular event. Disposition from the emergency department often will be contingent on whether the patient is stable in other ways and prompt follow-up is available. This all presupposes that the emergency physician has made an accurate diagnosis, so that the neurologist isn't trashing the EP for tying up a precious hospital bed for someone with hypoglycemia, Todd's paralysis that resolves by the time the admitting physician comes in, or some benign vestibular disorder. Some experts say brain imaging for the most part can be performed on an outpatient basis, as can carotid scanning and echocardiography, perhaps even in a timely way. (Stroke 2006;37:1139.) Patients do not need to be in the hospital to be taught the value of exercise and cessation of smoking. They can certainly be started on any statin, diuretic, or ACE inhibitor without being hospitalized. Then there are the dangers of being in the hospital at all for anyone: exposure to methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, risk of deep venous thrombosis, and deconditioning from being confined to a hospital bed. At any rate, many patients with TIA and normal imaging on diffusion-weighted imaging do well. One study of 83 consecutive patients listed th incidence of recurrent cerebral ischemic event after approximately 13 months at 30 percent if infarction was present, but only 14 percent if no infarction was present on diffusion-weighted imaging. (Stroke 2004;35:2313.) More convincingly, in a case series of 57 patients presenting with TIA, the rate of recurrent ischemic stroke in patients who had TIA with infarction during their hospital stay (3 to 5 days) was 14.8 percent, while no recurrent or new stroke occurred in patients with TIA and normal imaging. (Cerebrovasc Dis 2002;14:177.) The Bottom Lines There will be ongoing debate about how TIA should be defined and what technology is needed to determine whether a TIA actually occurred. From our perspective, there are some therapies which may prevent stroke and enough science to justify testing. It certainly adds more value to prevent neurologic deficit than to hospitalize someone after a CVA for rehabilitation purposes. There is a dearth of evidence on exactly what to do with the TIA patient in the emergency department. Patients with clear neurologic deficits such as aphasia or hemiparesis may be at higher risk than those with sensory events or vertigo. TIA work-up clearly lends itself to a brief hospital observation stay. Because the persistent concern is for tight carotid stenosis requiring revascularization, the case could be made for sending TIA patients home as long as their carotid arteries have been evaluated. Clearly, the last word has not been issued about whether all TIAs should be admitted. The fact that there has been a debate published this year (pro and con) in the stroke literature attests to this. In fact, the con position in the debate over hospitalization for TIAs was held by a geriatrician who works in a national health service country (Australia). If he thinks he can get a timely work-up there, surely we might be able to do so in the U.S. EMN on the Web Looking for Dr. James Roberts' article on kidney stones?

It can be caused by a dysfunction of the self-preservation instinct, which can manifest in life-threatening self-mutilation tendencies. Auto-aggression can also be one of the symptoms of psychiatric or emotional dysfunctions such as borderline personality disorder, psychopathy or schizophrenia. A dental appointment, being usually a source of great stress, can induce certain auto-aggressive behaviors as well as dental examination can show some lesions or abnormal changes of anatomical structures in the oral cavity which should be thoroughly examined and treated multidisciplinary according to patient’s behavior.",

      "title": "Posttraumatic Stress Disorder",
      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an intense and disabling response to a traumatic event. Acute PTSD occurs 1 to <3 months following the event, whereas chronic PTSD persists for 3 months or longer. The symptoms fall primarily into three clusters. The first includes reexperiencing the event. This reaction manifests clinically as distressing memories, nightmares, or the more extreme \"flashbacks\" to the event itself. During reexposure (either from internal cues such as reexperiencing in the mind, or external, such as visiting the scene of the accident), the person suffers from intense anxiety and distress. The second cluster can, to some extent, be seen as a reaction to the first. This response is characterized by avoidance of reexposure to the trauma and numbing to the psychological responses the exposure creates, including a more generalized emotional numbing. The third symptom cluster involves a constant hyperalert state. The person may have difficulty falling or staying asleep, may have an increased startle response, may have more trouble concentrating, and may be more generally irritable or angry.Approximately 70% of children have had exposure to a traumatic event before age 16 years; however, despite the large amount of exposure, the 6-month prevalence of PTSD in these patients is ∼3.7% for boys and 6.3% for girls. Protective factors against PTSD include, in descending order of importance, connections to positive caretakers, feelings of self-worth, feelings of hope, importance to others, talents valued by others, religious faith, and socioeconomic advantage.Specific risk factors for developing PTSD also exist. These factors primarily fall into four categories, the first of which includes lack of resilience or negative prior life experiences, which would include a history of other traumatic exposures, preexisting psychological problems, and substance abuse. The second main risk factor is the type of traumatic event. Nearly 100% of children who see a parent being killed or sexually assaulted acquire PTSD. This observation is important because it appears that in children, threat to a parent is equivalent to threat to self. Additionally, PTSD develops in 90% of sexually abused children, 77% of children who see a school shooting, and 35% who witness violence around their home.The effects of exposure to trauma through media are less clear. Many researchers have found that children resonate with media via reexposure if they were personally affected by the original trauma, but not if the trauma was more distant.A third area of risk concerns the child's reaction to the trauma. Dissociation, a psychological mechanism whereby a person attempts to protect him- or herself by separating from reality, was found to be strongly predictive of posttraumatic symptoms. Finally, the resources available to a child after a traumatic exposure can be critical. The most important of these is an attentive parent or guardian; thus, attending to parents' mental health can actually be the most effective intervention in aiding the child's recovery.Screening for and identifying PTSD can be difficult. Standardized assessments, such as the Traumatic Events Screening Inventory (see Suggested Reading) can be useful to evaluate exposure. Even after exposure is assessed, diagnosing PTSD itself can be complex, and may best be left to a child mental health provider. If a referral seems difficult, scheduling frequent appointments (monthly) to address any continued disability from the reaction to a trauma can be helpful.Treatment for PTSD is complicated and multifactorial. Regarding medications, there is some evidence that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have some utility. In adults, these agents have been shown to reduce symptoms in all three of the symptom clusters described previously, but in children, only two small studies (24 and 26 children, respectively) support their effectiveness. Additionally, SSRIs can lead to activation (irritability, poor attention, and sleep disturbance), which can mimic the hyperarousal cluster of PTSD symptoms.In two child-specific studies, clonidine was found to decrease basal heart rate, anxiety, impulsivity, and PTSD hyperarousal. Propranolol also was found to decrease reexperiencing and hyperarousal. Opiates may be beneficial, but should be used with caution. Even controlling for subjective pain, one study found that there was a significant linear association between morphine dosage and 6-month reduction in PTSD symptoms. Neuroleptic agents, such as risperidone, have shown mixed results. Benzodiazepines have not been found to be beneficial in treating PTSD-specific symptoms, and may worsen some symptoms characterized primarily by disinhibition (aggression, acting out).In children, the strongest empiricalevidence to date supports Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavior Therapy (TF-CBT). In fact, a study comparing TF-CBT and placebo to TF-CBT and an SSRI showed no significant differences in response rates. TF-CBT begins with the child directly discussing the traumatic event, and then proceeds to anxiety-management techniques, such as relaxation and correction of distorted trauma-related thoughts. Through this procedure, the children learn that they do not have to be afraid of their memories. CBT often is accompanied by psychological education and parental involvement. Research shows that the better parents cope with the trauma and the more they support their children, the better their children will function. Therefore, it is important for parents to seek treatment for themselves so as to develop the necessary coping skills that will help their children.Comments: After September 11th and, more recently, the devastating earthquake and tsunami in Japan, there has been more focused national and international attention on PTSD in children and adolescents. These experiences provide important examples of how communitywide interventions are essential and needed; however, Dr Kelly's In Brief reminded me of how important this topic is to patients whom I serve. I have worked most of my career with low-income patients who live in an urban area and I have been continually inspired by the resilience of these families. This In Brief reminded me of the heightened risk of these children and adolescents to PTSD because of their chance of witnessing or being involved with traumatic events, such as homicide, domestic violence, child abuse, house fires, or even dog attacks. I worry that parents may minimize some of these experiences because, unfortunately, they occur more frequently in urban communities. It is important that parents know that we as pediatric health-care providers have an interest in these experiences and to ensure that diagnosis and treatment is initiated.",

A number of clinical syndromes are described and their differential diagnosis considered. The clinical picture will usually change as the child grows older. Laboratory investigations including EEG. are not helpful. At whatever age the schizophrenic child is seen, the following difficulties are most likely to be encountered: 1) Lack of firm self-identity, disturbed body image and lack of clear ego boundaries. This may be directly apparent or may be determined by the use of projective methods or drawings. These difficulties constitute the core problem and are essential to the diagnosis. 2) Dereistic feeling, thinking and behaviour. 3) The simultaneous presence of impaired and precocious psychological functioning. 4) A loss of normal interests or the appearance of unusual or regressive ones. 5) Language disturbances in content or in rhythm, intonation, pitch, stress or volume. 6) Deficient social relationships with impaired capacity to empathize and a tendency to withdrawal. Certainty about individual identity and what lies outside and inside the ego is essential for normal relationships. Awareness of the changing clinical features of childhood schizophrenia and careful examination for basic problems in identity and distinction of internal and external reality will help in arriving at a diagnosis.",

The most frequent cause is stroke, followed by tumor, trauma, anoxia, vascular malformation, or multiple sclerosis. For some causes (and for stroke in particular), AIM can occur immediately after the brain lesion (for example, hemiballism during the acute phase of the stroke (Destée et al., 1990) whereas initial motor deficit may improve or be recovered rapidly. However, in other situations, AIMs (e.g. dystonia) emerge following a long period (a few months or years) of stable motor impairment (Marsden et al., 1985; Scott and Jankovic, 1996). AIMs can also be subdivided into transient (hemiballism, often in the acute phase) and persistent (dystonia, tremor, etc.). Whatever their timescales of appearance or disappearance, AIM may be the main symptom of stroke. This induces a delay in diagnosis or even a lack of knowledge of the specific diagnosis, since for the same underlying cause, the type of AIM can be quite different. This problem is sometimes clinically evident when the AIM is intense (hemiballism) or, in contrast, very moderate and focalized (asterixis). It is clear that a delay in diagnosis may have unhelpful consequences in terms of the patient's clinical and therapeutic management.",

      "title": "Anger Disorders",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Anger is a frequently experienced emotion for most people (1). When mild to moderate in intensity and expressed in constructive, nonhostile ways, anger can lead to positive, adaptive behaviors such as expressing feelings; asserting one's rights, thoughts, and feelings; problem solving; redressing concerns; setting appropriate limits on the behavior of others; and motivating effective behavior (1,2). Anger, however, is a double-edged sword, often leading to many negative outcomes. For example, chronic anger and hostility are associated with health problems such as coronary artery disease, hypertension, compromised immune functioning, dental problems, and overall mortality (3). Intense anger is often associated with marital discord, abusive parenting, intimate partner violence, and other relationship problems (4,5). Anger has also been implicated in school violence, bullying, and disrupted teen relations. Anger may also lead to major or minor property damage (4), and an overall propensity to aggression and violence (6). Anger is also associated with reduced work effectiveness and problems such as being placed on probation, demotion, and termination (7). For some angry individuals, their anger is totally externalized and entirely justified, leaving their sense of self untouched. For others, however, their anger impairs their sense ofpsychological well-being; they feel out of control and overwhelmed by their anger and feel anxious, embarrassed, guilty, ashamed, and depressed by their anger and anger-related reactions. While these are but a few examples, anger and its dysfunctional expression affects the physical, psychological, interpersonal, educational, and vocational lives of many people.",

      "title": "Blackout",
      "abstract": "Note that the terms ‘syncope’ and ‘loss of consciousness’ are not interchangeable as loss of consciousness can be due to either syncopal or non-syncopal causes. Syncope is a form of loss of consciousness in which hypoperfusion of the brain is the cause (from the Greek syn (together) and kopein (to cut), referring to the fact that the blood flow that joins the brain together with the rest of the body has been cut). Syncopal causes can be subdivided by mechanism as follows: • ‘Reflex’: this is believed to involve activation of a primitive reflex that leads mammals to ‘play dead’ when faced with danger. Their heart rate slows and their blood pressure drops temporarily, reducing cerebral perfusion and leading to syncope. Some people appear to have a low threshold for activating this reflex in specific situations—for example after standing still for a long time, after seeing something frightening (e.g. blood, needles), or when straining (micturition, defecation). • ‘Cardiac’: pathologies causing a reduction in cardiac output (such as arrhythmias or outlet obstruction) can also lead to syncope. • ‘Orthostatic’: orthostatic hypotension basically means low blood pressure on sitting or standing (as opposed to lying flat). When we stand up there is a sudden drop in blood pressure that we compensate for by vasoconstriction, particularly of the ‘capacitance’ veins in the legs. This reduces the intravascular space, enabling us to maintain the pressure. However, this vasoconstriction takes a few seconds, so to prevent a transient fall in blood pressure every time we stand, there is a temporary increase in heart rate. Patients with reduced intravascular volume (e.g. from dehydration) and/or in whom the normal autonomic response (transient tachycardia and peripheral vasoconstriction) to standing is blunted (e.g. due to drugs or autonomic neuropathy) are vulnerable to blackouts. • ‘Cerebrovascular’: these are non-cardiac structural causes of reduced cerebral perfusion, i.e. obstructions to the blood flow between the heart and the brain. They are relatively uncommon. The main causes of a transient loss of consciousness are summarized in Figure 3.1, with the most common in large font. You should also remember that patients may believe they have lost consciousness when in fact they haven’t.",

      "abstract": "Alexithymic phenomena may result from a variety of psychological sources. Psychoanalytic observation of psychosomatic patients (and others as well) reveals that the inability to name, recognize, contain or work through one's affective states is frequently one manifestation of defensive structures of a psychotic kind (more radical than denial which deals with certain neurotic anxieties). Such massive defense has been created as a bulwark against various dangers, such as (1) psychotic anxieties (fear of mental or physical fragmentation; loss of identity-feeling; danger of uncontrollable, explosive action); (2) profound perturbation concerning the narcissistic self-image and its fluctuations, and (3) pathological formation of the ego-ideal structure concerning affective experience. All of these may contribute to the creation of alexithymic defects.",

Common examples include self‐cutting, burning, and hitting. Self‐injury is especially common among adolescents and is associated with varied types of psychopathology, including mood and anxiety disorders and suicide attempts. Most people who frequently self‐injure begin in adolescence and stop in young adulthood, although the majority of those who try self‐injury engage in the behavior just once or a few times. People engage in self‐injury for a variety of reasons; the most commonly reported are reduction of negative emotional experiences and self‐punishment. Some people also engage in self‐injury to communicate with or influence others. Psychotherapies emphasizing emotional regulation, problem solving, and functional assessment appear to be most effective for treating self‐injury.",

      "abstract": "Bipolar disorder (formerly called manic-depressive illness or manic depression) is a mental disorder that causes unusual shifts in mood, energy, activity levels, concentration, and the ability to carry out day-to-day tasks. During mood swings, there may be features of psychosis (delusions and hallucinations) that are mood-congruent. Although psychotic symptoms are seen only in a minority of patients, they explain the early terminology of manic–depressive psychosis. Stage 1a is defined as mild or non-specific symptoms of mood disorder and intervened as formal mental health literacy; family psychoeducation; substance abuse reduction; cognitive behavioral therapy. Euphoric means the experience of pleasure or excitement and intense feelings of well-being and happiness. Certain natural rewards and social activities, such as aerobic exercise, laughter, listening to or making music, and dancing, can induce a state of euphoria. Racing thoughts are consistent, persistent, often intrusive thoughts that come in rapid succession. There is a direct link between depression and anxiety and racing thoughts. Whereas jumping from topic to topic as in the flight of ideas can be observed by others, ascertainment of racing thoughts requires asking the child whether his or her thoughts seem to be going too fast.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Limbic psychotic trigger reaction (LPTR) includes paroxysmal, out-of-character, motiveless, unplanned felonies (or similarly bizarre social misbehavior), all committed during flat affect, autonomic arousal and a fleeting de novo psychosis. A transient limbic hyperactivation is implicated that impairs prefrontal monitoring (judgment, planning, intent, volition, emotional participation) but preserves memory for the acts. It is hypothesized that LPTR implicates an atavistic regression to a limbic ‘paleo-consciousness’, exemplified by a 24th patient (parental infanticide), presented herein. He had closed head injury and borderline abnormal posterior brain pathology (EEG/CT), which might have contributed to his unusually numerous visual hallucinations.

      "title": "Convulsiones y epilepsia—Autism Toolkit",
      "abstract": "Las convulsiones son causadas por un ataque de actividad excesiva en el cerebro. Un niño que tiene una convulsión puede perder el conocimiento (desmayarse) durante un período breve, temblar violentamente con todo su cuerpo, tener movimientos corporales reiterados y poco comunes, sufrir crisis atónicas (episodios de caída), tener convulsiones mientras duerme o tener la mirada perdida.La epilepsia se define como 2 o más convulsiones en las que el niño no tiene fiebre ni ningún otro motivo médico para sufrir una convulsión.Alrededor de 1 de cada 4 niños con trastornos del espectro autista o TEA (ASD, por sus siglas en inglés) tiene convulsiones. Las convulsiones suelen comenzar en la primera infancia o en los primeros años de la adolescencia. Los niños con TEA que tienen un coeficiente intelectual más bajo o que no pueden hablar son los que corren mayor riesgo de tener convulsiones.Con frecuencia los niños con TEA tienen movimientos reiterativos y episodios en los que se quedan mirando el vacío. A menudo un médico puede detectar qué comportamientos reiterativos podrían ser convulsiones. Una prueba llamada electroencefalograma (EEG) puede registrar la actividad eléctrica del cerebro y ayudar a un médico a verificar la presencia de convulsiones. El electroencefalograma puede registrar la ocurrencia de una convulsión solo cuando el equipo de EEG está conectado al niño. No es posible detectar con un EEG las convulsiones que ocurran en otros momentos. A veces es necesario hacer un EEG durante un tiempo prolongado para ver si los movimientos o desmayos son convulsiones.La mayoría de los niños con TEA no necesitan un EEG. Es probable que el médico solicite un EEG si un niño tiene desmayos que el médico crea que son convulsiones o si el niño perdió recientemente destrezas de habla o de otro tipo. El electroencefalograma se hace generalmente cuando el niño está despierto y luego dormido. Hay distintos tipos de EEG; algunos se completan durante una visita más corta al hospital y otros se realizan durante toda la noche en el hospital o en el hogar. El médico decidirá qué tipo de EEG es adecuado para cada niño.En la mayoría de los casos, los medicamentos llamados anticonvulsivos pueden ayudar a controlar las convulsiones. Por lo general estos medicamentos reducen la cantidad de convulsiones, pero no siempre pueden eliminarlas. Algunos niños obtienen resultados anormales en sus EEG, pero no tienen convulsiones evidentes. Aún no está claro si los anticonvulsivos pueden ser útiles en esas situaciones.Uno de 2 tipos específicos de aceite de cannabidiol (conocido como aceite CBD) está actualmente aprobado por la Administración de Alimentos y Medicamentos de los Estados Unidos (US Food and Drug Administration) para el tratamiento de convulsiones en niños con 2 tipos de epilepsia grave (los síndromes de Lennox-Gastaut y de Dravet). El aceite de cannabidiol no está aprobado para el manejo del TEA en niños que no padezcan las afecciones específicas que se mencionaron anteriormente.Para obtener más información sobre las convulsiones, comuníquese con la Epilepsy Foundation (www.epilepsyfoundation.org).La información incluida en este recurso no debería reemplazar la atención médica ni el consejo de su pediatra.

      "abstract": "Abstract Functions of Emotions and Their Role in Psychopathology Observations of children with psychopathology make it clear that emotions are important in the difficulties they suffer. Childhood psychopathology is generally divided into two classes, externalizing and internalizing disorders. A child with an externalizing disorder, such as conduct disorder, is aggressive and destructive apparently without adequate provocation. He (boys show much higher rates of conduct disorder than girls) will react to other children’s playful or friendly overtures with hostility. He steals from his parents without regard to their feelings. He taunts and teases until his sibling starts to cry. Such behaviors have an emotional quality. He seems to be angry with the world and he maintains a mode of retaliation. A child with an internalizing disorder behaves differently. She (girls have a somewhat higher prevalence of internalizing disorders than boys) may withdraw from many situations because they make her feel frightened. She often feels lonely, and feels that others do not like her. Her mood is often low and she is unlikely to initiate activities with peers.",

      "title": "Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy — A Maturation Syndrome Coming of Age",
      "abstract": "Myoclonic Seizures: As noted above, myoclonic movements are one of the main symptoms of JME and consist of generalized seizures which are brief, irregular jerks of the head, trunk, and limbs that can be either symmetric or asymmetric, and may involve isolated regions of the body or the whole body.They usually predominate in the upper limbs (mostly distal muscles), although they occasionally involve muscles in the abdomen, paraspinal distributions, and lower extremity [27].It is not uncommon for myoclonic seizures to be so subtle or brief that they are perceived as benign \"inner shocks\".As subtle as the may be, patients tend to more readily notice asymmetric jerks involving the dominant upper extremity because such movements noticeably impair daily functioning.The jerks, if violent, may cause the patient to drop or throw objects, or fall to the floor-which may be mistaken for nonpathological clumsiness.Myoclonic seizures can manifest as discrete, single events or they may occur in clusters.They are usually not associated with loss of consciousness but it is not uncommon for patients to lose awareness during the jerks.Moreover, clusters of myoclonic events can evolve into a GTCS and cause post-ictal confusion.They can occur during transition to sleep or during awakening from sleep, usually in the early morning hours [28].This early morning pattern of seizures is associated with an increase in cortical excitability during that time of day, which has been noted in other patients with GGE, but to a greater extent in JME patients [29].Developmentally, these jerks often subside in the fourth decade of life, although GTCS or absence seizures tend to persist [30].Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizures: About 80% of the patients with JME have GTCS.These seizures are also more likely to occur if precipitated by sleep deprivation or alcohol intake.Usually, these events are immediately preceded by a series of myoclonic jerks and associated tongue biting prior to generalization.Because, as noted above, myoclonic events are often insidious, patients first seek treatment following an initial GTCS and are then subsequently diagnosed with JME.Typically, upon further evaluation, such patients acknowledge also that they have experienced myoclonic jerks, a description which adds additional clinical support for a JME diagnosis.Due to this association, some authors have proposed that clinicians should",

      "title": "CAUSES AND MANAGEMENT OF STRESS AT WORK",
      "abstract": "tress has been defined in different ways over the years.Originally, it was conceived of as pressure from the environment, then as strain within the person.The generally accepted definition today is one of interaction between the situation and the individual.It is the psychological and physical state that results when the resources of the individual are not sufficient to cope with the demands and pressures of the situation.Thus, stress is more likely in some situations than others and in some individuals than others.Stress can undermine the achievement of goals, both for individuals and for organisations (box 1).Signs of stress can be seen in people's behaviour, especially in changes in behaviour.Acute responses to stress may be in the areas of feelings (for example, anxiety, depression, irritability, fatigue), behaviour (for example, being withdrawn, aggressive, tearful, unmotivated), thinking (for example, difficulties of concentration and problem solving) or physical symptoms (for example, palpitations, nausea, headaches).If stress persists, there are changes in neuroendocrine, cardiovascular, autonomic and immunological functioning, leading to mental and physical ill health (for example anxiety, depression, heart disease) (box 2, fig 1). 1 Situations that are likely to cause stress are those that are unpredictable or uncontrollable, uncertain, ambiguous or unfamiliar, or involving conflict, loss or performance expectations.Stress may be caused by time limited events, such as the pressures of examinations or work deadlines, or by ongoing situations, such as family demands, job insecurity, or long commuting journeys.Resources that help meet the pressures and demands faced at work include personal characteristics such as coping skills (for example, problem solving, assertiveness, time management) and the work situation such as a good working environment and social support.These resources can be increased by investment in work infrastructure, training, good management and employment practices, and the way that work is organised.Historically, the typical response from employers to stress at work has been to blame the victim of stress, rather than its cause.Increasingly, it is being recognised that employers have a duty, in many cases in law, to ensure that employees do not become ill.It is also in their long term economic interests to prevent stress, as stress is likely to lead to high staff turnover, an increase in sickness absence and early retirement, increased stress in those staff still at work, reduced work performance and increased rate of accidents, and reduced client satisfaction.Good employment practice includes assessing the risk of stress amongst employees.This involves:c looking for pressures at work which could cause high and long lasting levels of stress c deciding who might be harmed by these c deciding whether you are doing enough to prevent that harm. c HOW STRESS IS CAUSEDThe degree of stress experienced depends on the functioning of two protective physiological mechanisms:c \"Alarm reaction\".When confronted with a threat to our safety, our first response is physiological arousal: our muscles tense and breathing and heart rate become more rapid.This serves us well when the threat is the proverbial bull in the field rushing towards us.We either fight or flee.Present day threats tend to be more psychological-for example, unjustified verbal attack by a superior at work.It is usually not socially acceptable to act by \"fight or flight\", and an alternative means of expressing the resultant emotional and physical energy is required.This falls in the arena of assertive communication.c \"Adaptation\".The second adaptive mechanism allows us to cease responding when we learn that stimuli in the environment are no longer a threat to our safety.For example, when we first spend time in a house near a railway line, our response to trains hurtling past is to be startled, as described above.Over time, our response dwindles.If this process did not function, we would eventually collapse from physical wear and tear, and mental exhaustion.",

      "abstract": "Tics are repetitive, sharp, rapid, non-rhythmic movements or utterances that are the result of sudden, abrupt and involuntary muscular contractions. Stereotypies are repetitive, apparently impulsive, rhythmic, purposeless movements that follow an individual repertoire that is specific to each individual and that occur under a variable time pattern, which may be either transient or persistent. Both are included in the Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders, fifth edition (DSM-5), among the neurodevelopmental disorders, and together with coordination development disorder go to make up the group of motor disorders. For tics, the categories of 'Tourette's disorder', 'chronic motor or vocal tic disorder' and 'unspecified tic disorder' have been maintained, whereas the category 'transient tics' has disappeared and 'provisional tic disorder' and 'other specified tic disorders' have been incorporated. Within stereotypic movement disorder, the DSM-5 replaces 'non-functional' by 'apparently purposeless'; the thresholds of the need for medical care are withdrawn and replaced with the manual's standard involvement criterion; mental retardation is no longer mentioned and emphasis is placed on the severity of the stereotypic movement; and a criterion concerning the onset of symptoms and specifiers of the existence or not of self-injurious behaviours have been added, together with the association with genetic or general medical diseases or extrinsic factors. Moreover, a categorisation depending on severity has also been included. Trastornos motores en los trastornos del neurodesarrollo. Tics y estereotipias.Los tics son movimientos o vocalizaciones repetitivos, bruscos, rapidos y no ritmicos, resultantes de contracciones musculares subitas, abruptas e involuntarias. Las estereotipias son movimientos repetitivos, aparentemente impulsivos, ritmicos y carentes de propositividad, que siguen un repertorio individual propio de cada individuo y que se presentan bajo un patron temporal variable, bien transitorio o persistente. Ambos se incluyen en el Manual diagnostico y estadistico de los trastornos mentales, quinta edicion (DSM-5), en los trastornos del neurodesarrollo, y conforman, junto con el trastorno del desarrollo de la coordinacion, el grupo de trastornos motores. Para los tics se han mantenido las categorias de 'trastorno de Tourette', 'trastorno de tics motor o vocal cronico' y 'trastorno de tics no especificado'; desaparece la categoria de 'tics transitorios' y se incorporan el 'trastorno de tics provisional' y 'otros trastornos de tics especificados'. En el trastorno de movimientos estereotipado, el DSM-5 sustituye 'no funcional' por 'aparentemente carente de sentido', se retiran los umbrales de necesidad de atencion medica y se sustituyen por el criterio de afectacion estandar del manual, se omite la alusion al retraso mental para matizar la gravedad del movimiento estereotipado, y se añaden un criterio de inicio de sintomas y especificadores de existencia o no de comportamientos autolesivos, asi como de asociacion a enfermedades geneticas, medicas generales o factores extrinsecos.

The site of noncerebral trauma has been described by the Abbreviated Injury Scale as head or neck, face, chest, abdomen or pelvic contents, extremities or pelvic girdle, external. Neurobehavioral and adaptive dysfunctions after an accident are diverse and complex. There are characteristic sensorimotor and cognitive symptoms, for example, dizziness, visual and balance symptoms. The spectrum of injuries caused by a concussive event creates adaptive difficulties in coping with the social and physical environments.",

ED could be operationalized as a multidimensional maladaptive pattern of exercise, leading to clinically impairment or distress. Its criteria are: tolerance, withdrawal effects, lack of control, reductions in other activities, impaired psychological, social or physical functioning. For primary ED, the physical activity is an end in itself; for secondary ED, motivation is extrinsic--to control or alter body mass and shape. Estimates of the prevalence of ED range from 2-3% to 20-30%. Hypotheses of ED development concentrate on beta-endorphin, sympathetic arousal, affect regulation or some psychological explanations (e.g., exercise as distractor).",

      "abstract": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), previously known as battle fatigue syndrome or shell shock, is a severe mental disturbance condition that is normally triggered by the experience of some frightening/scary events or trauma where a person undergoes some serious physical or mental harm or threatened. PTSD is a long-life effect of the continuous occurrence of traumatic conditions, leading to the production of feelings of helplessness, intense fear, and horror in the person. There are various examples of events that can cause PTSD, such as physical, mental, or sexual assault at home or working place by others, unexpected death of a loved one, an accidental event, war, or some kind of natural disaster. Treatment of PTSD includes the removal or reduction of these emotional feelings or symptoms with the aim to improve the daily life functioning of a person. Problems which are needed to be considered in case of PTSD like ongoing trauma, abusive or bad relationships. Various drugs which are used for the treatment of PTSD include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) (citalopram, fluvoxamine, fluoxetine, etc.); tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline and isocarboxazid); mood stabilizers (Divalproex and lamotrigine); atypical antipsychotics (aripiprazole and quetiapine), etc. In this review, we have covered the different risk factors, case studies related to various treatment options with different age group of peoples with PTSD and their effects on them. We have also covered the symptoms and associated disorders which can play a key role in the development of PTSD.",

      "title": "The Meaning of Stress, Anxiety and Collective Panic in Clinical Settings",
      "abstract": "The physician is often confronted with questions about the meaning of symptoms or diseases. One of the tasks of those practicing psychosomatic medicine is to delve into the answers to these questions. Anxiety is a common phenomenon in everyday practice, and it is evoked in the most different situations. The relationship of this kind of anxiety (i.e. when having to consider painful or life-threatening diseases or medical or surgical procedures) to both neurotic anxiety and normal anxiety (i.e. the one expressed in poetry or artistic creativity or present in the biographies of outstanding men and women who by no means could be considered as psychiatric cases) leads to define anxiety as the psychological equivalent of stress. Anxiety is the unspecific response to a threat induced by too sudden or too extreme variations in the environment (life changes, stressful situations, life events). Such mechanisms, so important for survival, can become self-destructive, paving the way for the appearance of diseases represented by unsuccessful coping mechanisms. The analogy with the diseases of the general adaptation syndrome of Selye (i.e. autoimmune diseases) and with reactions in collective panics in disasters becomes evident under this perspective. The physician has to face anxiety with the same attitude that he faces pain, that is to say, going beyond a consideration of its 'normality' (it is quite normal to feel chest pain in acute heart infarct), keeping in mind its role in survival. Most creative men and women are, as many psychohistorical studies have shown, individuals who have been able to find a solution to internal conflicts which were conflicts of the society in which they lived, leading to a solution of this same external conflict. The anxiety which is often expressed in this situation has an element of restlessness, which is lacking in anxiety and related disorders which are dominated by feelings of inability to cope expressed time and again as 'Dr., I can't' (go out in the street, in elevators, live, love, work, and so on).",

It includes delusional beliefs about bodily sensations or functions; such as feeling malodorous, being infected by parasites, having dysmorphic features, or that a certain organ is no longer functioning. MHP has been divided into 4 main categories: Delusions of infestation (including parasitosis); delusions of dysmorphophobia, such as of misshapenness, personal ugliness, or exaggerated size of body parts (this seems closest to that of body dysmorphic disorder); delusions of foul body odours or halitosis or delusional bromosis (also known as olfactory reference syndrome); and a miscellaneous group.",

The three cardinal signs and symptoms of delirium are: clouding of consciousness, impaired attention, and altered states of arousal (hyperarousal or hypo-arousal).

A video-polysomnography revealed periodic leg movements (figure) and arousal followed by sleep episodes while standing, rhythmic marching, and falling (videos 1 and 2 on the Neurology ® Web site at [Neurology.org][1]). A reevaluation of his history revealed symptoms compatible with restless legs syndrome (RLS). Rotigotine1 proved very effective, supporting the diagnosis of RLS. Periodic leg movement disorder leading to sleep-related rhythmic movement disorder could also be considered. Automatic behavior denotes severe sleep deprivation2 and may represent a non-REM parasomnia. Severe RLS may present with automatic behavior complicating its diagnosis.

Likewise, Temporo-Mandibular Jaw and Joint disorder(s) – or simply TMD – is a multifactorial etiological condition, regularly encountered in the dental office. Whether due to malocclusion, bruxism, stress and/or trauma, TMD destabilizes the whole cranio-mandibular system structurally and functionally, via affecting mastication, teeth, supporting structures, comfort and aesthetics, and thus, QoL, again. While several treatment regimens do exist for such conditions, some of which have been standardized for use over the years, most continue to lack proper evidence-based literature support. Hence, (1) caution is to be exercised; and (2) the need for alternative therapeutic strategies is amplified, subsequently, the door for innovation is wide open. Indeed, neuromuscular electrical stimulation or “NMES”, is perhaps a fine example. Herein, we present the interested oro-dental health care provider with an up-dated revision of this therapeutic modality, its potential benefits, risks and concerns, to best handle the dysphagic patient: an intra-disciplinary approach or strategy bridging contemporary dentistry with speech and language therapy; a rather obscure and un-discovered yet critical allied health profession . A pre-clinical and clinical prospectus on employing inventive NMES-based regimens and devices to manage TMD is also highlighted.",

      "title": "Schizotypy, schizotypic psychopathology and schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "The term schizotypy refers to a latent personality organization that putatively harbors the liability for schizophrenia and can give rise to a variety of schizophrenia-related phenotypic outcomes1, 2. This personality organization, which is determined by any number of as-yet-unknown schizophrenia-related genetic influences acting against a background of polygenic assets and liabilities as well as impacts from the environment (e.g., stressors, epigenetic inputs), can manifest itself variously at the phenotypic level, ranging from clinically diagnosable schizophrenia through pathological personality manifestations (e.g., schizotypal, paranoid, avoidant and schizoid personality disorders) to subtle, sub-clinical psychotic-like phenomenology (e.g., perceptual aberrations, magical ideation, referential thinking, interpersonal aversiveness). Schizotypy may also manifest itself in an imperceptible manner, undetectable by the unaided naked eye, through deviance on endophenotypes that have established valid relations with schizophrenia. Moreover, schizotypy as a latent construct (personality organization) is centrally embedded in a diathesis-stressor theoretical model that has considerable utility as an organizing framework for the study of schizophrenia, schizophrenia-related psychopathology (e.g., delusional disorder, psychosis not otherwise specified, schizotypal, paranoid and other related personality disorders) as well as putative schizophrenia endophenotypes, a view I have advocated for several decades3-6. Note, the term schizotypy is not restricted to describe only those clinical manifestations that are associated with schizotypal personality disorder2, 5, 6. Nor is the term reserved to indicate a methodological preference, e.g. for self-report psychometric assessments. Rather, schizotypy can be assessed using a variety of approaches such as interviews, psychometric inventories, familial risk and/or laboratory measures. Schizotypic persons may indeed display some of the phenomenology associated with schizotypal personality disorder, but they may also show other features6-8. There is a long history of describing clinical states bearing the imprint of schizotypy and an implicit connection to schizophrenia liability, including observations by Kraepelin, Bleuler, Rado, Meehl, Gottesman and myself. It has been argued that a clear demarcation in an underlying schizophrenia liability continuum (e.g., a pronounced threshold effect or discontinuity) is required to explain the emergence of schizotypic indicators in psychological functioning. An alternative position regarding schizotypy holds that it is a dimension of normal personality, not necessarily connected to schizophrenia liability, and representing something of a \"healthy\" personality factor. However, observers of schizophrenia and schizotypic psychopathology, in the main, do not view schizotypy as benign or reflective of healthy psychological adjustment. Non-psychotic schizotypic states (defined using clinical, laboratory and/or familial risk) have been associated with a wide range of findings, including sustained attention deficits, working memory deficits, smooth pursuit eye movement dysfunction, schizophrenia-related psychometric deviance on the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), executive functioning deficits, dysfunctional anti-saccade performance, subtle formal thought disorder, clinical schizotypal and paranoid personality features, schizophrenia-related social cognition deficits, exteroceptive and proprioceptive somatosensory deficits, psychomotor abnormalities, and candidate polymorphisms (e.g., ZNF804A, Val158Met-COMT, neuregulin-1). That schizotypic persons manifest such a panorama of deficits, similar in nature albeit less in degree to those seen in schizophrenia, argues for a connection or common underlying construct for conditions defined phenotypically (i.e., schizotypic subjects vs. schizophrenia-affected subjects). An area of continued speculation concerns the underlying structure of schizotypy and the precise nature of the variation expressed in that latent construct. Considerable statistical evidence, using a variety of latent structure methods, points to the existence of possible underlying discontinuities or severe threshold effects in schizotypy, and work in this area continues. Such evidence stimulates the caveat, to wit, that the use of continuous measures to assess phenotypic manifestations of schizotypy does not ipso facto mean that the underlying (or latent) schizotypy construct is fully quantitative or uniformly graded by degree. The course and clinical outcome for those designated as harboring schizotypy remains an area of active inquiry. It is entirely conceivable that many individuals possessing schizotypy may traverse the life course escaping psychotic illness as well as other diagnosable schizotypic manifestations. The expectation that some people validly at risk for schizophrenia may never manifest the illness is well established in the reality of discordant monozygotic twins, in which one twin is affected by schizophrenia and the co-twin is not psychotic (perhaps not even diagnosable as having a non-psychotic, but detectable, clinical schizotypic condition like schizotypal or paranoid personality disorder). Individuals that achieve elevated scores on psychometric measures of schizotypy have been shown to be at increased risk for schizophrenia and schizophrenia-related psychoses later in life, as well as a variety of other related outcomes. Such individuals also display poorer psychosocial functioning, lower rates of marriage, increased use of psychiatric medications, and increased utilization of psychiatric services2. It is entirely conceivable that many individuals designated as \"prodromal\" for schizophrenia, but who do not convert to schizophrenia (which is 60-70% of such subjects), are in fact harboring schizotypy and will, even if not psychotic, show impairments across the life span, perhaps adopting an eccentric or odd manner of personality functioning. The schizotypy model has helped to adjust the boundaries of schizophrenia phenotype in the DSM-5 (e.g., schizotypal pathology is now included with schizophrenia). Furthermore, illuminating the nature of schizotypy may aid in unraveling the current puzzle of the very low conversion to schizophrenia rates seen in \"prodromal\" schizophrenia research9. Finally, I have argued that the schizotypy framework may be useful in understanding configurations (rather than simple additive summation) of genes relevant to schizophrenia variants2, an idea that is beginning to gain traction. There is no doubt that incorporation of schizotypy indicators into genomic studies of schizophrenia increase their statistical power. The advantages of a cleaner unit of analysis (the schizotype), free from the effects of medication, institutionalization and neurocognitive decline, are axiomatic. However, the understanding (and misunderstanding) of the schizotypy model as well as alternative approaches to the construct require vigilance, in order to ensure that the approach continues to yield the fruit that it can.

Es el trastorno del movimiento más frecuente en la práctica clínica5,6. Los tipos de temblor que con más frecuencia se ve en la consulta de Atención Primaria (AP) son: el temblor fisiológico exagerado, el temblor esencial (TE) y el parkinsoniano7,8, siendo todos más frecuentes en personas de edad avanzada.

Se estima que padecen TE entre un 0,4 y un 3,9% de la población general9. En España, el estudio poblacional NEDICES obtuvo una prevalencia de TE del 5% en ancianos10. Otro metanálisis estimó una prevalencia global del 6,3% en mayores de 60 años11,12. En cualquier caso, es un problema frecuente, que a menudo comienza en personas en edad laboral y que puede progresar hasta afectar al empleo.

      "abstract": "Epilepsy is the propensity to have recurrent and unprovoked seizures; this propensity can result from a number of underlying aetiologies. Epilepsy is thus best considered a symptom of an underlying brain disorder. A single seizure is not usually considered sufficient to make a diagnosis of epilepsy. Epileptic seizures occurring solely in association with precipitants or triggering factors are termed acute symptomatic or situation-related seizures. Partial seizures arise from a localized region of cerebral cortex. The clinical manifestations of a partial seizure depend on where in the cortex it begins, and how fast and how far it spreads. Complex partial seizures frequently present as altered or 'automatic' behaviour. The patient may pluck at his or her clothes, fiddle with objects and act in a confused manner. Lip smacking or chewing movements, grimacing, undressing, the carrying out of purposeless activities or of aimless wandering may all occur on their own or in different combinations.",

      "abstract": "The biomechanical expert opinion on the injury mechanism is necessary in few cases only. However, the judgement of these cases is extremely compromised if mechanically wrong terms are introduced in the clinical report. Since the injury mechanism in the neck is very complex the clinical physician should concentrate on the clinical findings familiar to him; usually the clinician lacks technical case documentation and specific training in injury biomechanics. The relevant mechanisms of neck injuries are an indirect trauma induced by a) a head contact leading to compression, hyperflexion, hyperextension and/or hypertranslation and b) a non-head-contact mechanism (hyperflexion or hyperextension, hypertranslation, acceleration). A non-contact mechanism occurs e.g. during a rear end impact without head restraint (hyperextension) or a frontal collision of a belted occupant (hyperflexion) without head impact. The term \"whiplash\" is misleading and incorrect: It presumes a virtually non existing two phase movement back and forth (or vice versa) like during the development of the crack of the whip. Secondly, it mixes the physical criterion mechanism with the anatomical or morphological criterion injury e.g. distortion, sprain etc. A (head)-contact mechanism is due to a corresponding momentum exerted from the head on the neck. Again, the anatomical or morphological terms are equal, but the mechanism is different. During a contact mechanism as well as during a non-contact mechanism not only a hyperflexion or a hyperextension can occur; in the first phase of the impact also a shearing force between the upper vertebral bodies (CO-C2) may load the intervertebral structures by hypertranslation.",

      "abstract": "Self-mutilation (SM), the deliberate, nonsuicidal destruction of one's own body tissue, occurs in such culturally sanctioned practices as tattooing; body piercing; and healing, spiritual, and order-preserving rituals. As a symptom, it has typically been regarded as a manifestation of borderline behavior and misidentified as a suicide attempt. It has begun to attract mainstream media attention, and many more who suffer from it are expected to seek treatment. This review suggests that SM can best be understood as a morbid self-help effort providing rapid but temporary relief from feelings of depersonalization, guilt, rejection, and boredom as well as hallucinations, sexual preoccupations, and chaotic thoughts. Major SM includes infrequent acts such as eye enucleation and castration, commonly associated with psychosis and intoxication. Stereotypic SM includes such acts as head banging and self-biting most often accompanying Tourette's syndrome and severe mental retardation. Superficial/moderate SM includes compulsive acts such as trichotillomania and skin picking and such episodic acts as skin-cutting and burning, which evolve into an axis I syndrome of repetitive impulse dyscontrol with protean symptoms.",

It ranges from a normal, barely noticeable, physiologic phenomenon to a severe, disabling movement disorder. Tremors can be classified according to their phenomenology, distribution, frequency, amplitude or etiology (Deuschl et al., 1998). Phenomenologically, tremors are subdivided into two major categories: rest tremors and action tremors. Rest tremors occur when the body part is fully supported against gravity and not actively contracting. In contrast, action tremors manifest during voluntary muscle contraction on an antigravity posture (postural tremor) or a goaldirected movement (kinetic tremor) (Table 35.1). This phenomenologic classification is far from ideal since there are many overlapping features among different tremors, but it remains the most widely accepted classification.",

Although tics often spontaneously improve after childhood, they may persist into adulthood and become associated with a variety of comorbid disorders such as attention deficit disorder and obsessive–compulsive disorder. Tourette’s syndrome (TS), considered a genetic and neurodevelopmental disorder, is the most common cause of chronic tics. Motor and phonic tics consist of either simple or complex movements that may be seemingly goal directed. Motor tics may be rapid (clonic) or more prolonged. Many patients exhibit suggestibility and may have a compulsive component, sometimes perceived as an “urge” or a need to perform the movement or sound repetitively until it feels “just right.” Although tics are often considered relatively benign, many patients with TS have severe or disabling tics. “Whiplash” tics can produce disabling compressive myelopathy, and therefore need to be treated early and aggressively. When oral medications fail to provide satisfactory relief of tics, local chemodenervation with botulinum toxin (BoNT) offers the possibility of relaxing the muscles involved in focal tics without causing undesirable systemic side effects.",

Each of us is convinced of being a unique and stable individual, different from other individuals. These properties - stability ad coherence - belong to an image of ourselves that was proposed to us by the Other's look during the mirror phase. Brain focal lesions may threaten this certitude in two ways: 1) brain lesions result in deficiency, disability or handicap, which are experienced as a narcissistic injury. The patient questions himself about the image he offers to the Other's look, and, as a result, his sense of personal identity is unsettled; 2) a variety of focal brain lesions or dysfunctions may alter the activity of areas which are necessary for maintaining a stable image of the patients' body or self. This may lead patients to experience depersonalisation, autoscopy, somatoparaphrenic \"delusions\" or disturbed agency. The sense of personal identity may be disturbed during brief paroxystic or psychologically traumatic phenomena. However, this is not observed in chronic sequelae of brain lesions (e.g. right hemisphere syndrome or amnesic syndrome), even though the patients may present a broken up image of themselves.",

Twitching should be distinguished from the normal fasciculations of wasted muscles. Tics are repetitive stereotyped movements that can be held in check voluntarily, but the concentration required exhausts and stresses the patient. Myoclonic jerks are rapid shock-like muscle jerks, which are often repetitive and sometimes rhythmic. Opioids may cause myoclonic jerks. This normally only occurs for two reasons: the dose of opioid has been rapidly increased, or the patient's previously normal renal function has deteriorated, resulting in an accumulation of the metabolic products of opioids. A tremor is a rhythmic movement of a body part, caused by regular muscle contractions. Tremors can be of three types: intention tremor, postural tremor and resting tremor.",

      "abstract": "The sensation of vertigo, a subjective complaint, is sometimes defined as a hallucination of movement or an illusion. Since evaluation of hallucinations and illusions is an essential part of psychiatric practice, such definitions place vertigo at the doorstep of clinical psychiatry (Trimble 1984). Vertigo is a frequent symptom of psychiatric illness, in particular in anxiety, depression, and personahty disorders, but less frequent in psychosis. However, to complicate matters, because of its incapacitating nature vestibular dysfunction frequently causes psychiatric illness. This may bias the diagnosis of organic vertigo syndromes by a considerable neurotic overlay e.g. in patients with Menière's disease. Alternatively, a transient labyrinthine dysfunction, e.g. in vestibular neuritis, may initiate development of neurosis in which anxiety, panic attacks and depression are most common, and which typically preserves subjective vertigo and postural imbalance although the peripheral lesion is already either recovered or centrally compensated. In the latter case there is a history of an initial rotational vertigo, lateropulsion and nausea (with the objective clinical signs of horizontal rotatory nystagmus and unilateral hyporesponsiveness to caloric irrigation) which is followed by a more indefinite chronic dizziness with subjective postural imbalance or spells of vertigo during active body movements, associated with anxiety and change in behaviour (see Phobic Postural Vertigo, p. 292). Obsessional subjects are more likely to proceed from organic to psychiatric disease, and the obvious presence of an obsessional personality will support the diagnosis of this condition.",

Cutaneous compulsions (psychodermatoses) often have an underlying organic disease or trigger. Diagnosis and treatment include identifying the underlying trigger, treating secondary dermatoses, and modifying behavior to prevent recurrence; medications are a helpful adjunct if anxiety interferes with normal activities or learning. Dermatoses may be initiated by a pathology, with subsequent self-injury causing persistence or worsening of lesions.

      "abstract": "Self-harm, suicide attempts, disordered eating, addiction, and other forms of “acting out” are associated with the trauma of surviving violence. While these behaviours are pathologized as symptoms of mental illness, they can be understood, instead, as strategies of resistance against violence. When violence is ignored or normalized, the “acting out” associated with trauma can be a means of sounding an alarm that something is very wrong. This “acting out” can be understood as an embodied form of testimony. When direct resistance to violence, such as fighting back or escaping, is thwarted or impossible, traumatic “acting out” can be a way to draw attention to and resist violence. Psychiatry, instead of answering the call of trauma by addressing the underlying violence, works to silence that call. Through incarceration, sexual violence, enforced isolation, restricted motion, threats, coercive drugging, gaslighting, and other abusive tactics, psychiatry works to undermine the embodied testimony of trauma by producing compliance. The source of the problem is shifted from the original violence and located instead in the body of the traumatized person. Successful treatment is understood as the reduction or elimination of the very “symptoms” which are in reality acts of resistance to violence. Therefore, successful treatment essentially means submission. The carceral space of psychiatry continues the work of producing compliance even after the patient has left its enclosures, extending the space of the psych ward into the everyday lives of psychiatric survivors.",

      "abstract": "Four cases of compulsive self-injurious behaviour (SIB) with variable degrees of tissue damage targeted to the painful body part are reported in humans with neuropathic pain. Review of human literature revealed several cases, primarily after central nervous system (CNS) lesions, during which non-psychotic verbally communicating humans (mostly with intact mental status) target specifically the painful part which is usually analgesic or hypoalgesic. In few instances, however, the involved part is not only sentient but also hyperalgesic in part or as a whole. The act is characterized by uncontrollable urge and compulsion, aggravated under conditions of stress, isolation, confusion or depression, and occasionally occurring in patients with personality disorders, ongoing drug abuse and pre-existing compulsive habits (i.e., habitual nail biting or picking). It fails to be deterred by the appearance of the injured part, social mores or even the experience of pain. Successful treatment of underlying painful dysesthesiae with specific medications, neurostimulation or surgery has resulted in marked improvement of dysesthesiae accompanied by wound healing in several cases. The four presented cases and the human literature experience provide evidence that compulsive targeted SIB in humans with neuropathic pain and painful dysesthesiae is consistent with the concept that animal autotomy may result from chronic neuropathic pain after experimental peripheral or CNS lesions.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Stress is any stimulus, internal state, situation, or event, with an observable individual reaction, usually in the form of positively or negatively adapting to a new or different situation in one’s environment. The concept generally refers to the nature of an experience, resulting from persons interacting in the context of their environment, either through physiological overarousal or underarousal, with an outcome of psychological or physiological distress (bad stress outcome) or eustress (good stress outcome). Stressors range from minor to major, and can be positive or negative events. Generally stressors are life events, such as daily annoyances, pressures at home or on the job, marital discord and conflicts, emergencies, motor vehicle accidents, illness, and injury. Positive stressful life events and transitions include birth of a newborn, graduation ceremony, a family vacation, or a job promotion (Kaplan &amp; Sadock, 1998).",

Sometimes they are paroxysmal, but the victims never lose consciousness. (2) “Vocal tics”, occurring when the contractions spread to the laryngeal muscles. The victims utter sounds, often resembling the cries of an animal, such as barking, bellowing or whinnying (3). Generally the last to appear, though the order probably varies, is a compulsion to shout obscene or blasphemous words, insults or oaths. Echopraxia and echolalia are disorders bordering on this syndrome, and sometimes accompanying it.",

It can be further divided into positive myoclonus, which is active contraction of the muscle, and negative myoclonus or asterixis, defined as sudden loss of tone in the muscle. It must be distinguished from other hyperkinetic movements such as tics, chorea, tremor, and dystonia, which can all also have fast, jerky movements. The goal of videotaping is to capture the myoclonus in all the possible positions of occurrence and localize them to particular body regions. This is done by first observing at rest, then providing multiple types of stimulus including startle, touch, reflex elicitation, and finally provocation of myoclonus by voluntary activation of each body region.",

SIB may present as head banging, head hitting or face slapping, self-biting to the hands or other parts of the body, removing scabs from old wounds, self-pinching or scratching, hair pulling and eye poking. Clinically significant SIB presents serious challenges to professionals and may cause severe distress to carers. The point prevalence of SIB differs between studies, depending on the definition of SIB, the methodology used and the population studied. A behavioural monitoring programme should remain in place during treatment with psychotropic medication. This should include the use of rating scales such as the Aberrant Behaviour Checklist or Self-Injury Trauma Scale. The biological model in SIB is based on three types of neurotransmitters: dopamine, opioids and serotonin.",

This category includes chorea, dystonia, myoclonus, stereotypies, tics, and tremor. 2) Hypokinetic movement disorders refers to akinesia (lack of movement), hypokinesia (reduced amplitude of movement), bradykinesia (slow movement), and rigidity. Parkinsonism is the primary hypokinetic movement disorder. Movement disorders may be further categorized into primary and secondary disorders. In primary movement disorders, the abnormal movement is the primary manifestation of the disorder. In secondary movement disorders, a broader structural, toxic, metabolic, or inherited etiologic factor is responsible for the symptoms.",

Mada is considered as a prodromal phase of Unamada , or it can occur as an independent disease condition also. Mada / Madonmada is caused by various traumatic events or extreme stressors, and it is characterized by various features such as pradhyayati (immersed in thoughts/flashbacks/recurrent or persistent distressing thoughts), praswapati (excessive sleep), animittitam rodati (crying without any reason/pervasive negative emotions/depressed mood), akasmaat hasati (laughing inappropriately or without any reason/disorganized behavior), nidraalu (hypersomnia/excessive sleep), alpa vaak (diminished speech or poverty of speech/social withdrawal), nityam utsuka (hypervigilant/restlessness), trasta shareeri (tiredness/weakness), deenaaksha (depression/pervasive negative emotions), krodhana (angry outbursts/irritable behavior), nirapatrapa (self-destructive behavior/recklessness), purastaat avalokee (exaggerated startle response), na yathavritta eva (disorganized or abnormal behavior), parushatva of roma (roughness or dryness of skin and hair), and aavilam chakshusha (confused/teary eyes). Mada / Madonmada has shown similarity with various psychiatric conditions such as “acute stress disorder,” “posttraumatic stress disorder,” “brief psychotic disorder,” and “adjustment disorder.” The present study provides insights for clinical implementation of “ Mada / Madonmada ” in the diagnosis and management of “trauma- and stressor-related disorders” in terms of Ayurveda . It is astonishing that thousands of years before, “ Acharya Bhela ” has documented the conditions such as trauma- and stressor-related disorders in the form of Mada or Madonmada .",

When episodes of depersonalization are recurrent or persistent and lead to distress or dysfunction, the diagnosis of depersonalization disorder is made. Certain similarities in phenomenology, comorbidity, neurochemistry, and treatment response suggest a relationship to the obsessive-compulsive spectrum. However, depersonalization is a very poorly studied condition, and any conclusions must be viewed tentatively. Self-injurious behaviors are defined as intentionally self-inflicted bodily injuries without lethal intent. Basic categories are briefly described. Subsequently, the phenomenology and biology of both impulsive and compulsive self-injurious behaviors, and their relationship to the obsessive-compulsive spectrum, are discussed.",

This disease is characterized by a combination of disorders: cognitive (impaired attention, memory, thinking) and behavioral, productive (hallucinatory, delusional, affective, etc.) and negative (apathy, abulia, emotional and social detachment, etc.) symptoms. Schizophrenia causes psychosis, can be accompanied by disability and negatively affect all areas of life, including personal, social life, family and work activities. This disease is also characterized by changes in emotions, loss of concentration, autism, asociality (\"immersion in oneself\", unusual thoughts and fantasies), a drop in energy state and a violation of the will. The sick person does not understand that he is ill, and this complicates treatment. Psychoses become more frequent over time and this leads to frequent hallucinations, and they can affect all the senses. The most common are auditory hallucinations in the form of voices and a person's subordination to voices, which can make the situation dangerous. The absence of treatment for schizophrenia leads to an absolute loss of one's own \"I\", loss of a person's personality, and during an exacerbation of the disease, a person can harm first of all himself and then others.

      "abstract": "IntroductionNeuromuscular disease is a very broad term that encompasses many diseases and aliments that either directly, via intrinsic muscle pathology, or indirectly, via nerve pathology, impair the functioning of the muscles.Neuromuscular diseases affect the muscles and/or their nervous control and lead to problems with movement.Many are genetic; sometimes, an immune system disorder can cause them.As they have no cure, the aim of clinical treatment is to improve symptoms, increase mobility and lengthen life.Some of them affect the anterior horn cell, and are classified as acquired (e.g.poliomyelitis) and hereditary (e.g.spinal muscular atrophy) diseases.SMA is a genetic disease that attacks nerve cells, called motor neurons, in the spinal cord.As a consequence of the lost of the neurons, muscles weakness becomes to be evident, affecting walking, crawling, breathing, swallowing and head and neck control.Neuropathies affect the peripheral nerve and are divided into demyelinating (e.g.leucodystrophies) and axonal (e.g.porphyria) diseases.Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) is the most frequent hereditary form among the neuropathies and it's characterized by a wide range of symptoms so that CMT-1a is classified as demyelinating and CMT-2 as axonal (Marchesi & Pareyson, 2010).Defects in neuromuscular junctions cause infantile and non-infantile Botulism and Myasthenia Gravis (MG).MG is a antibodymediated autoimmune disorder of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) (Drachman, 1994;Meriggioli & Sanders, 2009).In most cases, it is caused by pathogenic autoantibodies directed towards the skeletal muscle acetylcholine receptor (AChR) (Patrick & Lindstrom, 1973) while in others, non-AChR components of the postsynaptic muscle endplate, such as the muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase (MUSK), might serve as targets for the autoimmune attack (Hoch et al., 2001).Although the precise origin of the autoimmune response in MG is not known, genetic predisposition and abnormalities of the thymus gland such as hyperplasia and neoplasia could have an important role in the onset of the disease (Berrih et al., 1984;Roxanis et al., 2001).Several diseases affect muscles: they are classified as acquired (e.g.dermatomyositis and polymyositis) and hereditary (e.g.myotonic disorders and myopaties) forms.Among the myopaties, muscular dystrophies are characterized by the primary wasting of skeletal muscle, caused by mutations in the proteins that form the link between the cytoskeleton and the basal lamina (Cossu & Sampaolesi, 2007).Mutations in the dystrophin gene cause severe form of hereditary muscular diseases; the most common are Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) and Becker Muscular Dystrophy (BMD).DMD patients suffer for complete lack of dystrophin that causes progressive degeneration, muscle wasting and death into the www.intechopen.com",

      "title": "Autizam kod djece i mladih",
      "abstract": "Autism is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder that affects all aspects of the child's personality (communication, motor skills, behavior and learning). It was first described by American child psychiatrist Leo Kanner in 1943, stating the basic characteristics of autism that have not been substantially changed (the inability of the child to establish normal contacts with parents, children and other people in general, delayed speech development and use speech to uncommunicative manner; repetitive and stereotyped games and obsessive insistence on the respect of a certain order, lack of imagination, good mechanical memory and normal physical appearance). Autistic people, except for the above characteristics, also have some special abilities, i.e. talents (talents related to music, memory, math, art, etc.). Autism belongs to the category of pervasive developmental disorders. In this category are also included: autism in childhood, atypical autism, Rett's disorder, the other disintegrative disorders of childhood, hyperactivity disorder associated with mental retardation and stereotyped movements, Asperger's Syndrome, other developmental disorders in childhood and pervasive developmental disorder, unspecified. Although the diagnosis of autism is not easy, there are several ways that can help in the diagnosis, for example history, clinical presentation, observing the child in different situations, psychological testing and various psychometric instruments. It is still not entirely clear what causes autism. As possible causes some authors suggest damage of the central nervous system, genetics, brain damage and disruption mirror neurons. Boys usually suffers of autism than girls. The most common is Kannerov syndrome, and disintegrative psychosis appears rarely. There are various therapeutic procedures and methods for people with autism, some of them are: behavioral therapy, music therapy, art therapy, play therapy, kinetic therapy, holding therapy, daily life therapy, sensory integration, different institutions, drugs, etc. As well as children with autism, their parents also need professional help. Education of children with autism should be based on respect for individual needs and differences of students. The prognosis for people with autism depends on the intellectual functioning, the development of speech and on the severity of characteristic symptoms of autism. The charter for the rights of people with autism was released at the Congress of autism in The Hague in 1992 in which was especially emphasized their right to free and full lives to the limit of their potential. The aim of this diploma thesis is to introduce some basic features and characteristics of autism.",

      "abstract": "States of agitation are frequent psychiatric emergency cases, which stem from very different biological, psychic and social constellations. Very often it is a question of a slipping expression of strong affects like fear, anger, pain and of excessive, reactive performances like flight, defence etc., which are built on top of the affects. Inner restlessness, which rises from unrestrained and disfigured drives, and the accompanying autonomic reactions of the affects promote the beginning of these states of agitation; whereas sensible expectations and clearly aimed absorptions of the drive do reduce the disposition to becoming agitated.",

      "abstract": "Background: Tics, defined as quick, rapid, sudden, recurrent, non-rhythmic motor movements or vocalizations are required components of Tourette Syndrome (TS) - a complex disorder characterized by the presence of fluctuating, chronic motor and vocal tics, and the presence of co-existing neuropsychological problems. Despite many advances, the underlying pathophysiology of tics/TS remains unknown. Objective: To address a variety of controversies surrounding the pathophysiology of TS. More specifically: 1) the configuration of circuits likely involved; 2) the role of inhibitory influences on motor control; 3) the classification of tics as either goal-directed or habitual behaviors; 4) the potential anatomical site of origin, e.g. cortex, striatum, thalamus, cerebellum, or other(s); and 5) the role of specific neurotransmitters (dopamine, glutamate, GABA, and others) as possible mechanisms (Abstract figure). Methods: Existing evidence from current clinical, basic science, and animal model studies are reviewed to provide: 1) an expanded understanding of individual components and the complex integration of the Cortico-Basal Ganglia-Thalamo-Cortical (CBGTC) circuit - the pathway involved with motor control; and 2) scientific data directly addressing each of the aforementioned controversies regarding pathways, inhibition, classification, anatomy, and neurotransmitters. Conclusion: Until a definitive pathophysiological mechanism is identified, one functional approach is to consider that a disruption anywhere within CBGTC circuitry, or a brain region inputting to the motor circuit, can lead to an aberrant message arriving at the primary motor cortex and enabling a tic. Pharmacologic modulation may be therapeutically beneficial, even though it might not be directed toward the primary abnormality.",

Since the definition of stereotypy is unclear, this term tends to be applied to involuntary, patterned, repetitive, and/or rhythmic movements. In this review, stereotypic movements were categorized into primary and secondary groups depending on the presence of underlying causes. Identification and evaluation of possible etiology should always be performed before starting treatment. For primary stereotypy, pharmacological therapy and/or training programs could be tried, but their efficacy is not well-established yet. On the other hand, removal of the underlying causes is the most essential and necessary for secondary stereotypy.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Spastic hypertonia is a costly complication of traumatic brain injury (TBI) that contributes to the loss of motor abilities. Along with associated impairments, it results in functional limitations, such as inability to use the hand in daily activities and difficulty with transfers and gait. When severe, it may cause pain and lead to contractures and other permanent deformities. Lance (1980) defined spasticity as “motor disorder characterized by a velocity-dependent increase in tonic stretch reflexes with exaggerated tendon jerks, resulting from hyperexcitability of the stretch reflex, as one component of the upper motor neuron syndrome.” While this is the most commonly used definition, it does not accurately describe the entire spectrum of motor disorders observed in clinical practice. Indeed, recent investigations suggest that spastic hypertonia may not be the sole cause of these impairments and functional limitations. (Ada et al., 1998; Gracies, 2001; Gracies et al., 2002; Levin et al., 2000; Sgouros &amp; Seri, 2002) Rather, the abnormalities associated with the upper motor neuron syndrome—dystonia, co contraction of agonists and antagonists, clonus, weakness, incoordination—are also believed to play important, if not predominant, roles.",

      "abstract": "Motion sickness is induced during passive locomotion in vehicles and is generated either by unfamihar bodily accelerations, to which the person has therefore not adapted, or by intersensory mismatch involving conflicting vestibular and visual stimuli (Dichgans and Brandt 1973, 1978; Benson 1977; Reason 1978; Brandt and Daroff 1980). According to the \"mismatch theory\"; (see also p. 3), spatial orientation and perception of movement are disturbed by a conflict between stimuli when the multisensory motion signals do not correspond to the expected pattern of sensory signals established from earlier experience with active locomotion. This may give rise to unpleasant illusions of movement with consequences of posture and the control of vehicles (Dichgans and Brandt 1978; Leibowitz et al. 1982) and to motion sickness as a result of summation. Thus, motion sickness is not a superfluous epiphenomenon of vestibular stimulation but — in a teleological sense — it represents a meaningful warning signal to withdraw the body from unusual stimulus situations which cannot be integrated with adequate dynamic spatial orientation. The first known reports on seasickness originate from Hippocrates. The major symptom of nausea is derived from the Greek word \"naus\" for ship. The general term \"motion sickness\" was coined by Irwin (1881). It stresses the phenomenological similarity of air-, sea-, car-, and space-sickness despite their different modes of provocation.",

I assume that neglect, caused, for example, by right parietal damage, results neither form simple sensory loss and nor from motor impairment. It also appears not to be a unitary disorder. Failures to orient towards salient stimuli, often labelled as “neglect”, can occur because of damage to other brain regions besides the parietal lobe, and in animals other than man. But failures to orient toward stimuli can result from several different types of difficulty. most crudely to organise a response towards the contralesional side (“output” or “intentional” neglect (Valenstein & Heilman, 1981) or from problems of detecting stimuli in contralesional space (“input” neglect). Sometimes these forms of neglect apparently occur together in the same individual, raising questions about the foci and extent of their brain lesions.",

This process is characterized for performing repetitive sequences of motion with the guidance of a physical therapist, and in some cases, requires doing the therapy without attendance, which may lead to unsatisfactory results due to pain, unclear guides and poor feedback on their performance. This paper presents the development of a humanoid passive mechanism for hand exercising using its limbs for achieving flexion/extension, pronation/supination and radial/ulnar deviations. Preliminary tests show an interest in having similar devices for hand training associated as a leisure activity that could be used as a stress reliever that allows entertaining while training.",

Different types of trauma (e.g., mechanical injury, electrical injury, anoxic injury, repetitive injury) incurred on different parts of the nervous system (brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerves) in various ways (single or repetitive injury) have produced a great variety of movement disorders (parkinsonism, dystonia, tremors, hyperkinesis). Trauma can cause movement disorders directly, it can increase the risk for certain diseases affecting the extrapyramidal system, or it can act as a catalyst for the manifestation of an underlying subclinical condition. The significance of risk factors (such as family history of movement disorders and previous use of antidopaminergic agents) for the development of post-traumatic movement disorders remains controversial. The underlying pathophysiology is poorly understood, but it appears that regardless of the location of the trauma, both peripheral and central nervous system mechanisms may be involved.",

Delusional thinking may occur in severe cases. Behaviourally, depression reflects helplessness or appeasement that arise from feelings of inferiority, entrapment, or defeat. Non-verbal behaviour in depression resembles ancient strategies of vertebrates to signal submission. At the cognitive level, people with depression often engage in ruminating thoughts, often involving self-derogation or worthlessness. Depression may occur in situations when one’s social status is threatened or an actual fall in rank has taken place. This is often accompanied by a reduction of serotonin availability. Genes conferring risk for depression when coupled with adverse early experiences may even protect against depression when associated with supportive parenting, suggesting genetic plasticity. Aside from ethological considerations, depression may also be linked to a dysfunction of the immune system.",

      "abstract": "Functional movement disorders are any type of movement disorder due to a brain network disorder where normal function is possible. The terminology of functional movement disorders has changed; in the recent past, these disorders were most frequently called psychogenic. Characteristics of functional movements include incongruity with a known type of involuntary movement; inconsistency in the pattern, degree, and distribution during the clinical course; improvement with distraction; and possible psychogenic background. While the movements are said to be fully involuntary, there is often some suggestibility. In the case of unilaterally predominant tremor, if the patient is requested to repeat voluntary movements with the intact or less affected hand at a certain pace, the tremor frequency might be replaced by the frequency of the voluntary movement, the phenomenon called entrainment.",

Three categories of manifestations of psycho-violence are distinguished: verbal aggression; dominant behavior; manifestations of jealousy that affect the victim of violence in different ways. Violations developing after the experienced psycho-violence affect all levels of an individual’s functioning and lead to sustainable personality changes. Objective: to identify the consequences of psycho-violence for different age categories. My theoretical study of the consequences of psycho-violence for different age categories made it possible to identify specific features of the consequences for different age categories. Consequences for children: sleep disturbances; hyperreactivity; impaired memory and concentration; irritability; a sharp decline in school performance; change of worldview; the emergence of many complexes; low self-esteem; maladaptation; health problems (various diseases occur); difficulty in building relationships; developmental delays (mental, emotional, speech); constant stress, fear, expectation of danger; suicidal tendency, asocial lifestyle. The consequences of psycho-violence in adults are disorders of a psychological and physical nature: sleep disturbances; nervous breakdowns; irritability; depression; anxiety; difficulty concentrating; panic conditions, heart attacks; loss of self-esteem; decreased self-esteem; violation of social relations; decrease in labor productivity. The consequences of psycho-violence for different age categories are different, the general thing is that violations affect all levels of a person’s functioning and lead to persistent personality changes.",

Newborn kittens and puppies lack the ability to maintain the body, as a whole, in an upright position. However, by one month of age, the posture of a pediatric patient should mirror that of an adult. Abnormal posture may be due to skeletal, muscular, and/or nervous system dysfunction. A head tilt is a specific type of abnormal posture that occurs with frequency in clinical practice. In dogs and cats, head tilts commonly result from infectious or inflammatory middle or inner ear disease, neurologic insult, or ischemic injury. Head tilts may occur in isolation; however, more commonly they are concurrent with other manifestations of neurologic disease, including ataxia, circling, facial nerve paralysis, falling, leaning, rolling, nystagmus, and/or positional strabismus. The presence of one or more of these clinical signs facilitates prioritization of differentials. This chapter cannot provide an exhaustive review of each clinical sign and differential diagnosis. Instead, the chapter emphasizes those conditions that are most commonly seen in clinical practice: peripheral vestibular syndrome, as caused by otitis media, otitis interna, and old dog vestibular syndrome; central vestibular syndrome, as caused by intracranial neoplasia and metronidazole toxicity; as well as canine hypothyroidism, which causes both.",

Basically, the psychomotoric unrest is an expression of frustrated emotion, preventing the child from adjustment to reality, thereby causing a deficit of experience, which inturn is the reason for a secondary lack of success, to which the child reacts again with psychomotoric unrest.

Unfortunately, few studies have been reported that advance theoretical perspectives on post-TBI depression. Currently, there is some evidence that neurochemical and anatomical changes contribute to post-TBI depression. Interpersonal factors, such as sense of belonging and social support, may contribute to the incidence of post-TBI depression. Because of limited theoretical viewpoints, advances have not been made in cost-effective and efficient interventions for this mood disorder, which prolongs rehabilitation and contributes to family suffering.",

      "title": "Pathological Gambling: Compulsive-Impulsive Spectrum Disorder, Behavioural Addiction, or Both?",
      "abstract": "Pathological gambling (PG) is a chronic and progressive condition, defined as “persistent and recurrent maladaptive gambling behaviour”; it is currently classified among the Impulse control disorders (Not Elsewhere Classified) in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders – Fourth Edition - Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR). The diagnostic criteria for PG resemble those of both Substance use disorders (SUDs) and Compulsive disorders (in particular, Obsessive compulsive disorder [OCD]). \r\nThe terms compulsivity and impulsivity are interchangeably used to describe difficulties in self-control leading to repetitive psychopathological behaviours; nonetheless, they represent two distinct constructs. Compulsive behaviours are driven by “a tendency to perform unpleasantly repetitive acts in a habitual or stereotyped manner to prevent perceived negative consequences, leading to functional impairment”, whereas impulsivity has been described as “a predisposition toward rapid, unplanned reactions to internal or external stimuli with diminished regard to the negative consequences of these reactions to the impulsive individual or others”. Features of both compulsivity and impulsivity are involved in PG phenomenology, and a large body of literature investigated these aspects mainly making use of clinical observation and results obtained through self-report questionnaires. PG can be conceptualized as a compulsive-impulsive spectrum disorder or as a behavioural addiction: these two theoretical frameworks have been proposed for PG categorization in DSM-5, thus and understanding which of them is better suited to PG symptoms is relevant for diagnostic classification issues. Although these two approaches are not mutually exclusive, adopting one rather than the other has important clinical implications.\r\nRecently, the importance of integrating phenotypic (i.e. phenomenological) and endophenotypic (i.e. behavioural/physiological) indicators in psychodiagnostic assessment has been highlighted. Endophenotypes are measures of the individual neuropsychological, neurophysiological and biochemical functioning, and consequently anomalies in endophenotypes are supposed to reflect impairments in the underlying neurocognitive processes. Impairments in motor inhibition ability and difficulties in delaying gratification and decision making, which are prefrontally-mediated cognitive functions, have been suggested to underlie problems in behavioural regulation (i.e. compulsive and impulsive behaviours). From this perspective, both compulsive and impulsive behaviours would represent: a. the performance of an action before its complete processing or the failure of interrupting already activated actions; b. a dysfunction in behavioural choices, which are perpetrated despite bad consequences for the individual. Therefore, cognitive measures of motor inhibition and decision making abilities may represent promising endophenotipic indicators of behavioural regulation, and deficits in these functions are hypothesized to underpin PG, OCD, and SUDs.\r\nThe present dissertation was conducted in the light of these considerations, and following the recommendation that directly comparing PGs with OCD patients and individuals with SUDs can represent a viable way to identify the most suitable classification for PG.\r\n\r\nA group of treatment-seeking PGs was compared with patients with OCD, Alcohol dependents (ADs) and healthy controls (HCs) on both self-report questionnaires and cognitive measures of compulsivity and impulsivity. The main aims were to investigate similarities and differences between clinical groups in such measures, as well as potentially different patterns of response in cognitive tasks. The Go/Nogo task was used to assess motor inhibition ability, whereas the Iowa Gambling Task (IGT) was administered to evaluate decision making processes. \r\nA preliminary comparison between small groups of PGs and croupiers on the same measures was also conducted; croupiers were chosen as gambling represents a relevant activity for both groups of individuals, and also in the light of the higher risks of developing problem or pathological gambling observed in casino employees than in general population. Consequently, the study of compulsivity and impulsivity in croupiers may be helpful in identifying the factors potentially involved in the development of PG. \r\nThe main results showed that PGs reported higher levels of both self-reported compulsivity and impulsivity than healthy individuals. Furthermore, a number of similarities between PGs, OCD patients and ADs in the phenotypic measures of both dimensions was observed. No evidence of impaired motor inhibition ability in PGs, OCD patients or ADs emerged. In regards to decision making processes, deficits in the IGT performance were found in PGs and ADs, whereas OCD patients did as good as HCs. Both PGs and ADs were characterized by a decline of their performance towards the end of the task, which indicated difficulties in the maintenance of learning to shift from disadvantageous to advantageous decisions. \r\nThe comparison between PGs and croupiers revealed that the former obtained higher scores on measures of compulsivity, whereas the latter did not differ from HCs. However, both PGs and croupiers reported similar and higher self-reported impulsivity than HCs. As regards the cognitive tasks, no significant difference between groups emerged; nonetheless, IGT profiles of learning showed that PGs had a poor performance and croupiers differed from HCs in that they did not improve in the last block of the task.\r\nSeveral conclusions may be drawn from present results. \r\nFirst of all, data from self-report measures suggest that both the compulsive-impulsive spectrum hypothesis and the behavioural addiction one might be adequate for PG categorization, as compulsivity and impulsivity co-occur in PGs. Furthermore, the numerous analogies emerged between PGs, OCD patients and ADs further support to include the three of them in a common spectrum of disorders.\r\nOn the other hand, IGT findings highlighted the presence of similar deficits in PGs and ADs. This result is in line with literature reporting dysfunctions in the brain circuitry underlying decision making ability, and therefore it supports the conceptualization of PG as an addictive disorder. Data emerged from the comparison between PGs and croupiers seem also to be consistent with this hypothesis, as probable vulnerability factors for addictions (i.e. impulsivity personality trait and potentially altered decision making processes) have been observed also in healthy individuals at risk for the development of PG. However, given the small samples sizes further studies are recommended. \r\nTo conclude, results from the present dissertation indicate that both classifications are equally appropriate for PG, depending on the adopted indicators. Other studies are required to further clarify which is the best diagnostic category for PG.",

Multiples teorias se han planteado en el intento de explicar la genesis del SSE: la inadecuada periodizacion de las cargas de entrenamiento que podria generar cambios tanto fisiologicos como psicologicos en los deportistas; la realizacion de actividades extradeportivas de tipo laborales, estudiantiles, situacion personal y la constante y ascendente presion social; cambios de horario, viajes; disfunciones hormonales posiblemente inducidas por el ejercicio. Otras hipotesis planteadas hacen referencia a la presencia de alteraciones en el sistema inmunologico;  eficiencia en las concentraciones plasmaticas de algunos aminoacidos; deplecion del glucogeno muscular e insuficiente consumo de calorias. Debido a la complejidad del sindrome, la variabilidad y poca especificidad en la presentacion de los sintomas, el diagnostico de SSE se realiza por exclusion de otras patologias y requiere un alto indice de sospecha y vigilancia por parte de los profesionales encargados del proceso de entrenamiento y de los mismos deportistas. Sin embargo los intentos de realizar dicho diagnostico por medio de una prueba o grupo de pruebas de laboratorio han sido hasta el momento infructuosos. Entre estas las que mejor correlacion han demostrado son las mediciones de cortisol, testosterona en ayunas, el indice cortisol/testosterona, las concentraciones de adrenocorticotrofina y hormona del crecimiento. En cuanto a pruebas diagnosticas clinicas, se han disenado desde tiempo atras una serie de cuestionarios basados en los sintomas frecuentemente reportados de SSE: el cuestionario del perfil del estado de animo; la escala de percepcion esfuerzo; el cuestionario de la sociedad francesa de medicina del deporte (SMFS); el cuestionario de estado estres-recuperacion para atletas; la utilizacion de zonas individuales de funcionamiento optimo. Al igual que con las pruebas de laboratorio, las herramientas de tipo clinico han demostrado en mayor o menor grado su utilidad y el uso de las mismas depende del conocimiento, la validacion local y la disposicion de estudios previos que certifiquen su sensibilidad y especificidad dentro de las diferentes poblaciones. Para nuestro pais una buena herramienta seria el cuestionario SMFS para deteccion de manifestaciones tempranas de SSE, el cual se encuentra adaptado transculturalmente para nuestra poblacion y que fue con exito empleado por nuestro grupo de trabajo para la deteccion se SSE en deportistas de Antioquia en 2012. En casos en los que se han instaurado los sintomas y persisten por un periodo superior a 2 semanas, se hace necesario iniciar medidas que permitan recuperar al deportista, la mas efectiva es el reposo y la suspension de la actividad competitiva y el entrenamiento; aun hay discusion en la literatura sobre el tipo de reposo, el cual puede ser absoluto, con suspension de todo tipo de actividad deportiva, o relativo, manteniendo actividades de ejercicio reportadas como “suaves”. Otras medidas tanto preventivas como de tratamiento utiles en SSE, son la adecuada periodizacion del entrenamiento, las medidas de higiene del sueno, el control de factores estresantes ambientales y sociales, el adecuado aporte calorico ajustado a las necesidades del momento del entrenamiento y la terapia sicologica encaminada a aumentar la seguridad, la autoconfianza, la autodeterminacion y disminuir la ansiedad y las reacciones al fracaso.

      "abstract": "Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) is a frequent head injury, one of the leading causes of disability worldwide and a global health issue. TBI is defined as a direct physical impact to the head, and it elicits physical, cognitive, psychological, psychosocial and functional impairments. TBI can be associated with a fatal outcome. In addition, TBI is related to high healthcare costs, long term rehabilitations, prolonged sick-leaves, and social and functional disability. The conflicts around the globe have facilitated the development of complications after TBI, especially in combat veterans, but also in civilians affected by conflicts and combat situations. The severity of TBI might vary from mild to moderate and severe forms of TBI. The complications of TBI include cognitive dysfunctions, posttraumatic epilepsy, headaches and other motor and sensory neurological impairments. There are two phases of TBI: primary (a head injury) and secondary (a biological response to primary TBI). The understanding of the pathophysiology of the secondary TBI is still unclear. Biological processes that develop after TBI are the result of the organism response to the primary TBI, and they include activation of the inflammatory mediators and secretion of neurotransmitters, the development of apoptosis or necrosis, regenerative processes and altered synaptic plasticity. The main goal in TBI research is to improve the understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms leading to the secondary TBI, to develop biomarkers that would be used to monitor the severity of injury, to find new targets (new molecules) for treatment and to have biomarkers that would follow the treatment response to reduce mortality and physical, cognitive, psychological, psychosocial and functional impairments after TBI, and to improve the clinical outcome.",

He considered RLS to be caused by \"convulsive distempers,\" such as epileptic activity. However, he did not suggest whether it was an inborn or an acquired condition. Progress over the following two and a half centuries was slow, with RLS having been mostly understood as a psychogenic disorder (3-5). In the 1940s, RLS was ascribed to various medical conditions, such as a vascular cause (6) or a familial origin with exacerbation during pregnancy (7).",

      "abstract": "Bizarre repetitive behaviour may be quite common, with estimates in people and dogs of a prevalence of up to 8%. Whereas these are often considered important indicators of mental health problems in people, in companion animals, many owners view these behaviours as quirky or even amusing features of their pet. However, the absence of self-report also means that the array of repetitive behaviour conditions in companion animals is also much more diverse than in humans and there is a danger of drawing simple analogies between human and non-human animals based on very superficial phenotypic features. For example, the following differentials might be considered for a dog who chases its tail:\r\n •Seizure possibly a primary partial seizure or secondary to a lesion in the brain such as damage to the vestibular system \r\n•Inner ear infection \r\n•Play \r\n•Pain in the tail or lower back due to damage to the nerves (neuralgia), bones or soft tissues \r\n•Pain around the region of the tail including skin inflammation and infections, impacted or infected anal sacs or trauma \r\n•A learned response aimed at attracting owner attention. \r\n•Acute conflict\r\n•Compulsive Disorder \r\n•Stereotypy \r\n\r\nThese explanations are not independent and a dog who starts chasing his tail for one reason may subsequently learn to do it at other times in order to gain attention, or the frequent repetition of the behaviour may potentially result in neurological sensitization and the expression of the behaviour becoming emancipated from its original triggering stimuli. From the simple (and by no means definitive) list of differentials for tail chasing given above it should be obvious that underlying cognition can vary enormously with a given presenting stereotypic behaviour. This presentation considers the value but also limitations of using companion animals as models of human conditions and especially the value of using real world rather than laboratory models.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Impulse control disorders (ICDs) are common disabling disorders that have impulsive behavior as a core feature. They emerge early in life and run a chronic lifelong course. They are assumed to lie at the severest end of a continuum of impulsivity that connects normal with pathological states. People with ICDs experience a drive to undertake repetitive acts. Although the consequences are damaging, performance of the impulsive act may be experienced as rewarding, or alternatively may relieve distress, implicating dysfunction of the neural circuitry involved in reward processing and/or behavioral inhibition. Clinical data are increasingly pointing toward an etiological association between some ICDs, such as pathological gambling and addiction, and others, such as trichotillomania and compulsive disorders. Comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders is also common, and hints at overlapping psychobiological processes across several diagnostic groups. The results of neurocognitive studies suggest that impulsivity is multidimensional and comprises dissociable cognitive and behavioral indices governed by separate underlying neural mechanisms. For example, trichotillomania may primarily involve motor impulsivity, whereas problem gambling may involve reward impulsivity and reflection impulsivity. Exploring neurocognitive changes in individuals with ICDs and other mental disorders characterized by poor impulse control, and among their family members, may help to elucidate the underpinning neurocircuitry and clarify their nosological status.",

      "abstract": "M.Tech. (Homoeopathy)%%%%Neck pain is a common condition usually experienced due to mechanical or degenerative problems (Colledge et al., 2010). The onset of neck pain may be acute and associated with asymmetrical restriction of neck movements and a history of awkward posture or sudden onset. Acute neck pain is an aching pain in the cervical paraspinal muscles and ligaments. It is associated with muscle spasm, stiffness and tightness in the upper back and shoulders that lasts up to six weeks. Headaches may be present (Bickley & Szilagyi, 2009). Causes of neck pain can be mechanical, inflammatory, metabolic, neoplastic, due to referred pain or other underlying aetiologies (Colledge et al., 2010). The most common treatments for neck pain are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, physiotherapy, chiropractic adjustment or therapeutic massage (Taylor, 2010). The NeuroTrac® MultiTENS device provides a non-invasive, drug-free method of controlling acute pain by transmitting mild electrical impulses via surface electrodes through the skin (Verity Medical Ltd., 2013). There have been many studies done on Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) devices, but little on its immediate effect on acute neck pain. The aim of this study was to determine the immediate effect of the NeuroTrac® MultiTENS device on acute neck pain, using the Neck Pain Disability Index, Visual Analogue Scale and the Cervical Range of Motion (CROM). This study was an unblinded, single-group experimental design (Brink, 2010). The study took place at the University of Johannesburg Campus Clinic. Recruitment took place by means of advertisements (Appendix H) placed at the University of Johannesburg campuses. Inclusion criteria consisted of males and females between the ages of eighteen to fifty years. Participants had to be suffering from aching pain in the cervical paraspinal muscles and ligaments with associated muscle spasm, stiffness and tightness in the upper back and shoulders that was present for more than one day and no longer than one week, with decreased range of motion on CROMs (Appendix G) and a minimum score of 10 on the Neck Pain Disability Index (Appendix D). Exclusion criteria consisted of participants suffering from severe headaches with meningeal signs associated nausea, blurred vision, photophobia and phonophobia or fever; a history of thrombus formation or transient ischaemic attack (Longmore et al., 2010); if they had a pacemaker or if they have had any head and neck surgery; if they suffered from cardiac arrhythmia or myocardial infarction; pregnancy or suspected pregnancy; if they had a general skin sensitivity or known allergy to adhesives or if they have had a recent chiropractic adjustment. A total of forty participants were selected. The participants acted as their own baseline control. The researcher was only required to see participants once for one forty minute session to determine the immediate vi effect of the NeuroTrac® MultiTENS device on acute neck pain. Participants were asked to fill in an Information (Appendix…",

      "abstract": "Psychological trauma is caused by an extreme event that occurs unexpectedly and suddenly, is life-threatening or is perceived to be so, and has an intense impact on the senses of the person involved. A wide range of reactions, responses and emotions can be brought forth by such experiences. Reactions directly following the event can be characterized as shock. Such reactions might include a feeling that nothing is real, emotional apathy and confusion, as well as physical responses such as trembling, shivering or nausea. Children often react differently than adults. For this reason, adults do not always understand the connection between the child's behavior and the traumatic experience. For instance, depressed children are often active and restless, while depressed adults are sluggish and move at a slower speed. Moreover, children suffer from extreme mood swings, from jubilant at the one extreme to deeply sorrowful.",

      "abstract": "Motivation literally means 'to be driven to do something' and refers to processes dealing with the origin and maintenance of the target behavior. Lack of motivation happens to be a core negative symptom of schizophrenia, and it directly influences the functional outcome. Decreased motivation for treatment as well as for other activities and education are common for schizophrenic patients. Motivation can be looked at as a result of complex interaction between physiological processes and the social context factors. The role of underlying physiological processes is not clear so far, and only since recently has attracted the attention of researchers. Clinical data emphasize the importance of intrinsic motivation in the cognitive recovery of schizophrenics who have problems with congruence between their behavior and motivating characteristics of the stimulus because of variety of interconnected mechanisms, like anticipation anhedonia, memory laps and problems with long-term memory concerning one's achievements in the past, the disordered mechanism of estimating the value of the task and the effort to accomplish it, and a number of other more complicated reasons.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Addictive behavior is any activity or behavior that has become the major focus of a person's life to the exclusion of other activities, or that has begun to harm the individual or others physically, mentally, or socially. Addictive behavior increases the risk of disease and/or associated personal and social problems. They are often experienced subjectively as \"loss of control\", that is, the behavior continues to occur despite volitional attempts to abstain or moderate use. Addiction implies psychological dependence, physical dependence, and a set of withdrawal symptoms if the substance is unavailable.[1] There are many common characteristics among the various addictive behaviors. First, the individual becomes obsessed (constantly thinks) of the object, activity, or substance and will seek it out, often to the detriment of work or interpersonal relationships. The person will compulsively engage in the activity even if he does not want to. Upon cessation of the activity, withdrawal symptoms of irritability, craving, and restlessness will often occur. The person does not appear to have control as to when, how long, or how much he will continue the behavior. He often denies problems resulting from his engagement in the behavior even though others can see the negative effects of it. Further, individuals with addictive behaviors will usually have low self esteem.[2] BURDEN OF PROBLEM Substance-related disorders have become matters of global concern because of impact on individual health, familial and social consequences, criminal and legal problems, and the effects on national productivity and economy. All the problems from use to dependence and from the most innocuous substance like tea/coffee to the most hard substances, contribute to the cost that the human society or a particular nation has to bear. In India, although alcohol use in ancient times and cannabis/affim (opium) in more recent times have been known and reported for some time, substance use problems have been recognized to have a significant importance as a public health problem only very recently. They are of particular concern among slum dwellers, transport workers, and youth.[3] Tobacco is the substance most easily accessible worldwide as well as in India. About one-fifth of the Indian population abuse tobacco, about 70% of this in the smoking form.[4] Passive smoking is a significant health hazard. There are 700,000 deaths per year due to smoking and 800,000–900,000 deaths per year due to all forms of tobacco use in India. Many of the deaths (>50%) are occurring below 70 years.[5] An estimated 34–42% of adult Indian population reports having used alcohol in their lifetime; 5–7% has been estimated to be abuser of alcohol; and 10–20 million persons have been estimated to be in need of treatment for dependence. A survey in India revealed that medical professionals had a higher rate of use and heavy use than general population.[5] Nearly 20–30% of admissions and consultations are due to alcohol-related problems in different healthcare settings but are under-recognized by primary care physicians.[6] With respect to heroin, India has now changed from being a transit country to a user country. General population surveys in India show opioid abuse rate as high as 24.8%. Another great concern especially with injectable opioids is spread of AIDS. Further, cannabis abuse in general population in India is 33% and abuse of tranquilizers is as high as 54%.[3] Remediation at central level: 'The Drug Deaddiction Program' was started in 1987–88 with the establishment of five deaddiction centers in central institutions, viz. AIIMS, New Delhi; Dr. RML Hospital, New Delhi; Lady Harding Medical College and Hospital; New Delhi; JIPMER, Pondicherry; and PGI, Chandigarh. The center at NIMHANS, Bangalore was established later as the sixth center. More recently, in 1999, a separate deaddiction center with inpatient setup was started in Central Institute of Psychiatry, Ranchi. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is mainly involved in providing treatment services to the addicts, whereas the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment deals with other aspects of the problem like awareness creation, counseling, and rehabilitation. From 1992–93, the scope of the scheme was enlarged to include assistance to State Governments/Union Territories for developing deaddiction centers in identified medical colleges/district-level hospitals. WHAT WORKS IN SUBSTANCE-USE DISORDERS? Treatment of substance-use disorders typically involves a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychosocial interventions. Techniques for medically assisted detoxification are widespread and effective. The following are the different strategies that are found useful in management of substance dependence.[7] i) Home versus inpatient detoxification Published reports have consistently failed to find any difference in outcome between long and short inpatient detoxification programs. Clients can usually complete home detoxification in 5–9 days. In ideal circumstances they are visited twice daily for the first three days and medication is supervised by a relative. Clients are breathalyzed and medication withheld if they have consumed significant amounts of alcohol. ii) Brief interventions Brief interventions are short, focused discussions (often of less than 15 minutes) that can reduce alcohol consumption in some individuals with hazardous drinking. They are designed to promote awareness of the negative effects of drinking and to motivate change. Brief interventions were shown to be moderately effective in the nontreatment-seeking groups, especially for those with less-severe alcohol problems. iii) Abstinence versus controlled use This is a great debate. The goal of controlled (moderate or nonproblem) drinking usually includes some limit on alcohol consumption (e.g., 4 units/day) provided that drinking does not lead to signs of dependence, intoxication, or social, legal and health problems. This runs contrary to the abstinence-based philosophy of Alcoholics Anonymous. Controlled drinking may be an option for young, socially stable drinkers with short, less-severe drinking histories. An individual's belief that controlled drinking is an achievable goal is also a good prognostic factor. Most authors agree that controlled drinking should not be recommended for people with heavy dependence. Controlled drinking is an attractive option for public health strategies aimed at nondependent problem drinking. This principle can also be tried for other substances. iv) Alcoholic Anonymous Based on Minnesota model, they involve the recognition that alcoholism is a relapsing illness that requires complete abstinence. Clients acknowledge the problems due to their alcoholism and are encouraged to attend 90 meetings in 90 days. Participants may engage the support of a sponsor who is an AA member who has been sober for at least one year. Similarly, there is narcotic anonymous for opioid addicts and nicotine anonymous for nicotine dependents. The evidence suggests that this twelve-step approach is at least as effective as most structured psychotherapies but not superior to any alternative treatments. v) Psychological therapies Motivational enhancement therapy Cognitive behavioral therapy Social skills training Community reinforcement approach Social behavior and network therapy Contingency management Cue exposure vi) Therapeutic community It requires prolonged residence (often 12–18 months) and it is extremely expensive. Most studies of therapeutic communities are conducted without control groups and the lack of randomization probably leads to selection bias in favor of more motivated patients. vii) Drug treatments Disulfiram, naltrexone, and acamprosate are currently the only treatments approved for the management of alcohol dependence. Other drugs which have been used for the same are topiramate, citrated calcium carbimide, SSRIs, tiapiride, nalmefene, metronidazole, and ondansetron. The oldest among these is disulfiram, being used from 1950s. Naltrexone was launched in India in 1998 and acamprosate in 2002. However, none has been proved to be significantly better than the other agents. In other words, all are equally effective.[5] Bupropion has been said to be the first line drug for nicotine craving. Another first line agent is nicotine itself, in the form of gum, inhaler, lozenge, patch, and nasal spray. Clonidine and nortriptyline are said to be the second line drugs. But the success rate with each of these drugs is marginal.[8] Sustained release bupropion is also considered to be effective as anticraving agent in cannabis dependence. Nefazodone also significantly reduces cannabis withdrawal related anxiety and muscle pain, while having no effect on dysphoria. The embryonic work on CB1 selective cannabinoid receptor antagonists such as SR141716 (rimonabant) has demonstrated that it successfully blocks the acute psychological and physiological effects of smoked cannabis in experienced human consumers and is well tolerated. There has been even less work on the use of cannabis agonists. However, this is a promising area for future research as a number of oral and inhaled THC preparations are being developed for medical cannabis trials.[9] Maintenance treatment is increasingly emphasized as the main therapy of opioid dependency. Abstinence-oriented therapy is nevertheless an important alternative, mainly psychological, and has considerable advantages for those benefitting from this strategy. Methadone or buprenorphine in tapering doses are used for detoxification along with α2 adrenergic agonists like clonidine or lofexidine. Time-limited agonist therapy is a specific approach using agonist stabilization as the basis for therapeutic interventions preceding tapering off of the maintenance therapy. The preventive effect of naltrexone and other antagonists is well known but the attrition rate is very high. It is also feasible for addicts to be introduced to naltrexone by detoxification under anesthesia or sedation.[10] ADDICTION MEDICINE AS A SPECIALTY As elaborated above, substance use is affecting a disproportionately large section of people of India. The prevalence is more than that of all severe mental disorders combined. When it comes to health problems, it should not be gauged merely by its prevalence, but by the health burden and social cost that it wreaks on the society. Psychiatric comorbidities like mood, anxiety, and psychotic disorders are also very commonly associated with substance dependence. Thus drug addiction is a titanic problem that needs special clinical attention. Today we are equipped with an arena of treatment strategies, both pharmacological and nonpharmacological. What we need is just an improvisation in its implementation. Treatment can be better systematized when addiction medicine is upgraded as a specialty. The specialty section on addiction medicine needs to fulfill the following aims and objectives.[6] Promote and advance the bio-psycho-social contributions to the science and practice of addiction medicine in all its different manifestations. Promote the improvement of the health of persons directly or indirectly impacted by substance-related problems. Promote prevention, control, treatment, and relief of all substance-related problems, as well as conditions which constitute high risk for potential drug-related problems. This involves encouraging and enabling the members of the society to explore and pursue 'evidence based' treatment strategies and prevention methods. This includes liaison with other stake holders, including but not limited to government agencies overseeing health, social justice and welfare, and finance and human development; nongovernmental agencies involved in direct care of persons with substance abuse. Promote other medical specialties and primary healthcare providers. This also requires sharing the expertise of members of the society and other professionals involved in diverse fields such as school mental health, community based rehabilitation, epidemiology, drug trials, maintaining disease registries, to mention a few. Actively engage in advocacy in order to influence policy making and legislation, keeping in mind that substance-use disorders and their consequences constitute a grave public health disorder which imposes an unacceptably severe burden on the health and well being of the people of India. Formulate and recommend standards of treatment and rehabilitation of persons or populations affected directly or indirectly by substance-use disorders. In addition, it will be necessary to obtain recommendations for syllabi and commission resources for the education and training of medical and nonmedical personnel involved in the field. Safeguard the interest of psychiatrists and fellow professionals engaged in the practice of addiction medicine in India. Promote research in the field of addiction science with a focus on translating the benefits of research to the bedside and propagate the use of evidence-based interventions in the daily delivery of mental healthcare. FUNCTIONING OF ADDICTION MEDICINE AS A SPECIALTY SECTION The following are some of the activities that are being suggested as functions of specialty section of addiction medicine:[6] A web portal, linked to the web page of the Indian Psychiatric Society, which will initially host information of relevance to the practice of addiction medicine in India, with direct and indirect links to published or unpublished scientific papers, databases, treatment protocols, available treatment agencies, online resources, etc; and later e-learning sites for online education and training. Coordinating Continuing Medical Education (CME) pertaining to the aspect of the science and practice of addiction medicine, with special emphasis on underserved areas like the northeastern states, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, etc. Enabling and commissioning position papers on the impact of substance abuse in India, with a view to influence public policy. Engaging with relevant organizations to promote demand-reduction strategies, such as the police to prevent drinking and driving, primary health providers, and emergency rooms for early detection and brief intervention Pursuing the aim of working to safeguard vulnerable populations, for example, inoculating children and adolescents through skills training and sensitizing physicians and pharmacists to prevent over the counter drug abuse. Examining the possibility of creating a national registry, using standardized data-entry protocols. CONCLUSION Substance-use disorders form more than 20% of the case load of psychiatric practitioners. However, practitioners have an attitude of therapeutic nihilism toward the addicted patient. This may be due to various reasons like lack of education about alcohol and substance abuse, attitude of hostility or aversion toward alcoholics, inability or discomfort to deal with the associated psychosocial issues, and learned pessimism about treatment – especially based on experience treating late stage alcoholics. However for effective outcome, early identification and treatment should be the goal. This is possible with more sophistication in the science of addiction medicine. Thus, evolving of a specialty section of addiction medicine is the need of the day.",

      "title": "Etiology of Late Onset Seizures",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:\r\nA ‘seizure’ (meaning “to take possession of”) is a paroxysmal event due to abnormal, excessive, hyper synchronous discharges from an aggregate of central nervous system neurons. Depending on the distribution of discharges, this abnormal CNS activity’s manifestations\r\ncan range from dramatic convulsive activity to experiential phenomena unidentified by the observer. A seizure needs to be distinguished from epilepsy. Epilepsy is described as the condition in which the patient has\r\nrecurrent seizures due to a chronic, underlying process. This definition implies that a person with a single seizures, or recurrent seizure due to correctable or avoidable circumstances, does not necessarily have\r\nepilepsy. Epilepsy can be defined as 2 or more unprovoked seizures. Seizures are separable as convulsive and non convulsive, depending on the prominence of motor features. They are also distinguished as focal or non focal. Seizures with an immediate or proximate cause, such as an acute metabolic disturbance, infection, or\r\nhead trauma, are symptomatic or provoked. In other instances, seizures that may result from past brain injury can be described as remote symptomatic.\r\nIn large number of people, a cause is not identifiable. These seizures are classified to be either idiopathic or cryptogenic. The term idiopathic refers to disease from an unknown cause and is presumed to have a genetic basis. The term cryptogenic implies a symptomatic cause\r\nundiagnosable with current medical technology.\r\nAIM OF THE STUDY:\r\n• To study the clinical profile of patients with new onset seizures after 40 yrs of age.\r\n• To find the etiology of seizures in adult population using clinical methods, CT Scan and Electroencephalography.\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS:\r\n50 patients, above 40 yrs of age, admitted with new onset seizures in medical wards of Government Stanley Hospital during June 2009 to October 2009.\r\nPatients with history of seizures in childhood or any time in past were excluded from the study.\r\nPatients with episodes mimicking seizures like syncope, TIAs and pseudo seizures were identified and excluded from the study.\r\nA detailed history of presenting complaints, details of the seizures, relevant past and personal history were obtained from the patient and reliable attendees. Details of the seizures included:\r\n• First attack,\r\n• Last attack,\r\n• Type of seizures,\r\n• Part of body involved,\r\n• Duration,\r\n• Frequency,\r\n• Maximum period of freedom,\r\n• Time of attack,\r\n• Precipitating factors,\r\n• Aura,\r\n• Post-ictal symptoms,\r\n• Automatisms.\r\nPast history included\r\n• Hypertension, inc. PIH,\r\n• Diabetes mellitius,\r\n• Head injury,\r\n• Previous stroke,\r\n• Cardiovascular (RHD/ MVP/ IHD),\r\n• Respiratory illnesses( COPD/ PTB/ BA),\r\n• Renal transplant,\r\n• Psychiatric illnesses,\r\n• Jaundice,\r\nPersonal history included\r\n• Smoking,\r\n• Drugs,\r\n• Alcohol,\r\n• Snuff,\r\n• Other addictions,\r\n• Pork,\r\n• Sleep,\r\n• Sexual promiscuity.\r\nA detailed general examination, including vital signs recording, complete neurological examination and examination of other systems was done.\r\nNeurological examination included\r\n• Neurocutaneous markers,\r\n• Focal deficits,\r\n• Confusional state,\r\n• Fundus.\r\nInvestigations like Blood counts, Random blood sugar, Renal function tests, Electrolytes, Chest X Ray, ECG, CT Brain- Plain, and EEG were done for all patients.\r\nCT Scans were noted for any clearly abnormal focal lesions. If suspicious lesions were found, a contrast CT Scan/ MRI was obtained depending on the situations.\r\nIn case of acute febrile illness or signs of meningeal irritation associated with the seizures,\r\n• QBC- for malarial parasite and\r\n• Cerebrospinal fluid analysis was done.\r\nLumbar puncture for CSF analysis was done under aseptic\r\nprecautions. CSF was analysed for:\r\n• Biochemistry: Sugar, proteins,\r\n• Cell count: Total, differential,\r\n• Cytology,\r\n• Culture and sensitivity,\r\n• Ziehl-nielson staining,\r\n• When these showed abnormalities, anti HSV antibodies were done when relevant.\r\nIn suspicious patients, like those who had tuberculoma-brain, viral encephalitis, HIV-ELISA and VDRL were done.\r\nCardiac evaluation was done for patients with abnormal physical findings in cardiovascular system, abnormal ECG and for all patients with cerebrovascular etiology (cerebral infarction and intracerebral haemorrhage).\r\nEEG was done for all the patients irrespective of whether an underlying cause was found or not.\r\nThe clinical profile, brain imaging findings, EEG findings were all analysed to derive and etiological diagnosis for the seizures.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\n1. Though late onset seizures was most common in the age group of 50-60 yrs (38%), there was not any significant difference between the other age groups. 36% were seen in the age group 40-5o yrs and 26% in > 70yrs.\r\n2. Males were 1.6 times more in number than females in patients presenting with late onset seizures.\r\n3. Generalised tonic clonic seizures were the commonest (50%), then partial seizures with secondary generalisation (26%), complex partial seizures (20%) and the last being simple partial seizures (4%).\r\n4. Family history does not seem to be relevant in patients with late onset seizures.\r\n5. 28 patients (56%) of patients had significant imaging findings pointing towards the diagnosis. Imaging is the most important factors determining the etiology of seizures. So every patient with new onset of seizures should undergo some form of imaging, CT- Plain/contrast or MRI- Brain depending on the situation as a part of\r\nevaluation.\r\n6. EEG did not contribute much to the diagnosis of etiology of the seizures.\r\n7. The most common etiology for late onset seizures was\r\ncerebrovascular accidents, ischemic events more commonly causing seizures than haemorrhagic events.\r\n8. This was followed by alcoholic withdrawal state, then granulomas and brain tumours.\r\n9. From the study, it is clear that most of the seizures in late adulthood are symptomatic (86%). So every care must be taken to evaluate the cause of new onset seizures in adults.",

At the same time hypomania may be related to the capability of mobilising the organism to gain many resources in a short period of time. Severe mood disorders may be related to the genetic variants, eg. of the serotonin transporter or brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which in several situations may give some evolutionary advantage. Affective temperaments, observed in the relatives of patients with affective disorders may be associated with some benefits in the social life. The relationship between early adversities and adult depression may be related to the phenomenon of the stress axis programming, which has deep evolutionary roots.

Three models of direct effects were examined: the no-specific effect model (all genetic disorders lead to identical behavioral outcomes), the totally specific model (each genetic disorder leads to unique outcomes), and the partially specific model (two or more genetic disorders lead to outcomes not shared by others with mental retardation). Although several cases of totally specific outcomes have been identified, partially specific effects most often occur. Persons in the surrounding environment are indirectly affected by behavioral propensities of different genetic disorders. Direct and indirect effects are also related to biological and developmental theory.",

In 1908, Schwalbe ascertained the hereditary nature of the illness and its variable expression (Schwalbe, 1908). The term‘dystonia musculorum deformans’ was first used by Oppenheim (1911), while Mendel and Flateau, emphasizing the twisted posture, called the disease ‘torsion dystonia’ or ‘torsion spasm’ (Flateau & Sterling, 1911; Zeman & Dyken, 1968).",

      "abstract": "Abstract Stereotypical behaviors are repetitive rhythmical movements that appear to seem purposeful to the person performing them but are purposeless. They can involve any part of the body and develop in most children under the age of three, but may persist and develop into more complicated routines in individuals with intellectual disabilities. These rhythmical movements may be mistaken for seizures, especially in individuals with ID however they are not accompanied by altered consciousness and individuals may be distracted from performing them. These movements seem to be rewarding for the individuals that perform them, and individuals will continue in the absence of social reinforcement and in the presence of aversive stimuli. Some evidence suggests that they may be a consequence of dysfunction in the basal ganglia. They are cited as a core feature of many genetic syndromes such as Rett syndrome and in conditions associated with ID such as autism. Clinicians need to be aware on stereotypy and non-epileptic behaviors to avoid unnecessary treatment as they mimic seizures.",

Major depression is a disabling condition which adversely affects a person′s family,work or school life and general health. Approximately 3. 4% of the patients with major depression commit suicide. Major depressive disorder is thought to result from the complex interplay of multiple inherited genetic factors and subsequent exposure to a wide range of environmental variables throughout life. The reciprocal connections between various brain regions and the neurochemical messengers involved in these connections are being increasingly studied from a systematic perspective. Furthermore,researchers are increasingly considering the impact of an individual psy- chosocial environment on brain chemistry,activity and anatomy,and vice versa. The impact of early childhood events in particular may have the long-lasting effects,especially if epigenetic changes are involved.",

When these signaling pathways are deficient or interrupted (e.g., by a hypoxic-ischemic event), the neurons do not migrate to the proper areas of the brain. This failure of normal signaling results in structurally abnormal or completely absent brain regions, including in the cerebral hemispheres, cerebellum, brainstem, or hippocampus.

Excessive stress has the potential to induce unfavorable effects in a variety of higher brain-functions, incurred as side effects to maladaptive responses in the genetically controlled stress-responsive neurosystems eg. in the hypo- thalamic-pituitary-adrenal(HPA) axis. Childhood traumatic experiences are particularly relevant as stressful experiences are they frequently occur in the early childhood, when susceptibility to external stressors is higher. Childhood abuse has been found in several study as directly associated with suicidal behavior, independently from other psychological or psychopathological risk factors. HPA-axis dysregulation is regarded as an endo- phenotype of depression-, anxiety- and alcohol abuse disorders, commonly found also in suicide behaviors. Various neurobiological alterations, suggesting abnormal HPA-axis activity and reactivity, have also been demonstrated to occur in suicidal behaviors including completed suicides. The HPA axis is a major systemic stress-modulator being mainly controlled by the regulatory corticotropin releasing hormone receptor 1 (CRHR1) gene. An overview will be presented of the role of the HPA axis in suicidal behaviors with a focus on CRHR1 gene. and on interactions with childhood traumatic experiences.",

These changes may be intrinsic and part of the process of ageing (see Chapter 3) or they may be the result of pathological conditions in other organs and tissues, especially in the cardiovascular system. Critchley (1931) has drawn attention to the effects of ageing on neurological signs. Many physical signs indicative of disease in the young may not be of significance in the diagnosis of clinical neurological disorders in old age. Thus loss of vibration sense and tendon jerks in the lower limbs do not necessarily mean peripheral neuropathy; irregular sluggish pupils are not pathognomonic of neurosyphilis and the frequent occurrence of a bodily attitude of flexion, disorders of gait, tremors and a positive glabellar tap sign leads to difficulties in establishing the diagnosis of Parkinsonism.",

      "abstract": "IntroductionAn epileptic seizure may be conceptualized as a paroxysmal pathological process in the brain of a heterogeneous etiology with heteromorphic clinical and electrophysiological manifestation.The cases of epileptic seizures are classified according to The International Classification of Epileptic Seizures (ICES) published for the first time by The International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) in 1970 and revised in 1981 (Commission on Classification and Terminology of the International League Against Epilepsy, 1981).This classification is a clinical one related to semiology of the seizures not to their etiology.Therefore it is necessary to exclude an acutely occurring cause responsible for occurrence of the seizure.In such cases we talk about the so-called acute symptomatic seizures.The underlying cause may be structural (e.g. head trauma), metabolic, toxic (e.g.alcohol), or an acute CNS infection, etc..The most frequent acute symptomatic seizures are the febrile seizures.In fact, the acute symptomatic seizures occur more frequently than epilepsy (\"unprovoked\" seizures).The risk of occurrence during one's life is very high -approximately 5% in males and 2.5% in females.If the acutely occurring cause has been withdrawn or cured without a residuum in the form of a brain lesion, the seizures do not recur (Dasheiff, 1987;Fromm, 1987).The antiepileptic medication is necessary for suppressing the seizures in the acute stage but usually there is no need for treatment continuation after the complete cure of the underlying disease.If the acutely occurring cause was not responsible for epileptic seizure we talk about a so-called unprovoked seizure.If the unprovoked epileptic seizure occurs in relation to a preceding neurological insult, the disorders is regarded as secondary to this insult; we call it the late symptomatic epileptic seizure or late symptomatic epilepsy in case of seizure recurrence.A general principle of treatment for the symptomatic (secondary) epileptic seizures has been a primary effort for resolution of the underlying disease that is the etiological factor responsible for the seizures.Given that it is impossible, the antiepileptic treatment in accordance with the treatment guidelines for individual seizure types (together with adherence to right living, behavioural precautions and concomitant solutions of the social and psychological issues) is indicated (Hovorka et al. 2004a;Hovorka et al. 2004b;Ošlejšková, 2007).Approximately 5% of the population experiences one unprovoked epileptic seizure in the lifetime (Forsgren et al., 1996; Hauser et al. 1993).The febrile seizure before the age of 5 occurs in approximately 5% of population (Hauser et al. 1996).Only about 25% of people experiencing the first unprovoked seizure see the doctor and nearly always the seizure is a generalized tonic-clonic one.Most of the people have no www.intechopen.com How to referenceIn order to correctly reference this scholarly work, feel free to copy and paste the following:",

      "abstract": "Abstract Dementia is characterized by an insidious and progressive loss of memory, disorientation, cognitive decline in other domains, and affective flattening. It is often accompanied by neuropsychological deficits such as aphasia, apraxia, agnosia, or disturbances in executive functioning including planning, organizing, and sequencing of events in a logical fashion. Behavioural symptoms such as withdrawal, depression, delusions, motor restlessness, wander-ing, or aggression may complicate dementia, particularly in advanced stages of the disorder. These behavioural symptoms may occur, in part, secondary to loss of orientation and memory, with loss of autobiographic memory perhaps being most devastating. A patient, for example, who is impaired in retrieving past social interactions from autobiographical memory or recalling other relevant personal information may be more likely to respond with increasing irritability or anxiety in situations that are actually or perceived unfamiliar. Such a patient may perhaps choose a ‘safety first’ strategy or remain captured in indecisiveness, which could manifest in ruminating thinking and stereotyped behaviour, or displacement activities expressing motivational conflict and ambivalence. In any event, the combination of memory loss with other cognitive disturbances certainly leads to a profound deterioration of social competence. It is also noteworthy that, in addition to the problems the patients have themselves, which they generally deny except in the earliest stages of the disorder (anosognosia), dementia creates a substantial burden on patients’ spouses, children and other carers.",

      "title": "Alien Hand Syndrome: Ethical Issues",
      "abstract": "Abstract At the nexus of theories of mind and the science of the brain is alien hand syndrome, a rare neurologic disorder in which one hand displays complex nonvolitional behaviours. The causative lesion disconnects brain regions that initiate hand movement from those needed for conscious recognition of volition. The aberrant behaviours may be unwilled and automatic, or in other cases they may be unconsciously willed yet unrecognised as the patient's own. Although sometimes touted as proof that free will does not exist, scientific descriptions of alien hand phenomenon are neutral in regard to competing philosophical theories attributing human decision to free agency or to determined physical processes. How one thinks about the nature of free will is important for ethics, which respects the validity of personal autonomy in moral decision making. Demonstration that some purposeful actions may be unwilled does not mean that all thoughts are predetermined. Therefore, neuroscientific explanations of alien hand syndrome can help to inform but do not dismantle traditional approaches to biomedical ethics. Key Concepts: Alien hand syndrome is a neurologic condition in which the affected hand exhibits complex nonvolitional behaviours. It results from disconnection of brain regions that control the hand from those that signal conscious recognition of volition. Other clinical examples of complex involuntary behaviours are recognised. Purposeful yet nonvolitional behaviour calls into question common understandings of free will. If no human decisions were freely made, then the ethical principle of respect for autonomy would be meaningless. Personal culpability for unwilled harmful actions is ethically and legally diminished. Just because some actions may be unwilled does not mean that all are. Scientific accounts of alien hand syndrome are philosophically neutral with respect to theories of agency versus determinism. Some instances of alien hand syndrome may be a form of agnosia of agency.",

      "abstract": "Movement disorders can be defined as neurologic syndromes in which there is either an excess of movement (commonly referred to as hyperkinesia, dyskinesia, and abnormal involuntary movement) or a paucity of voluntary and automatic movements unrelated to weakness or spasticity. The latter group can be referred to as hypokinesia (decreased amplitude of movement), but bradykinesia (slowness of movement) and akinesia (loss of movement) are common alternatives. The parkinsonian syndromes are the most common cause of paucity of movement; other hypokinetic disorders represent only a small group of patients. Movement disorders are conveniently divided into parkinsonism and all other types. Gait is affected by most types of movement disorders, including parkinsonism, dystonia, chorea, myoclonus, and cerebellar ataxia.",

      "title": "Effects of Different Types of Neurofeedback on Emotional Arousal: A Pilot Study",
      "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;Physiological activation, known as arousal, may fluctuate based on our biological needs, such as oxygen demands, or based on our emotions. Physiological arousal related to our emotional states is known as emotional arousal, and it can help or hinder our daily functioning. For example, high physiological arousal prepares our bodies for movement, which may occur if we feel threatened and must run away. High arousal may also improve performance on cognitive tasks to a certain point, but past that point, it may be excessive and impair performance and comfort. When functioning properly, emotional arousal typically fluctuates naturally based on our emotional state to meet our current needs. Despite its importance for our daily functioning, we do not fully understand the neurobiological mechanisms of functional emotional arousal and its regulation. As such, our understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms of dysfunctional arousal commonly associated with several mental health disorders, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, is also lacking. The neurophysiological underpinnings related to emotional arousal and its regulation can be measured with electroencephalography (EEG). Furthermore, the relationships between emotional arousal and EEG activity may be tested by manipulating EEG activity through EEG-based biofeedback, also known as neurofeedback (NF). NF incorporates recording EEG activity and providing comprehensible feedback of this activity in real time via brain-computer interface devices. Through operant conditioning, people can learn to regulate their EEG activity related to their emotional arousal. Previous studies have found several EEG-based brain activation patterns that may be related to emotional arousal, which may be used as the basis for NF. Such brain activation patterns include the Emotional Arousal Pattern (EMAP), which was derived from the EEG activity of healthy people, and a clinically-based EEG pattern that was derived from people with PTSD. In this randomized, double-blind study, we sought to determine whether healthy participants could upregulate relevant EEG activity via NF based on these two EEG patterns and a pre-recorded “sham” feedback control and, if so, what effects this training might have on emotional arousal and emotion processing. We measured alterations in emotional arousal over time through changes in EEG activity, peripheral physiology, self-report measures, and performance on an arousal-sensitive cognitive task. Due to COVID-19-related suspension of the data collection, only 13 people took part in this study. We did not find any significant changes in any measures of emotional arousal by group. From our pilot data, we were unable to determine the effectiveness of the emotional arousal-increasing NF. However, the descriptive trends in EEG power indicated that a full-scale NF study is merited. A full-scale NF study could improve our understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms of functional emotional arousal and how it may affect emotion processing. It would also support emotional arousal-based NF as a potential individualized treatment intervention for those with disorders related to arousal-regulation difficulties, such as PTSD.&lt;/p&gt;",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is the most serious and disabling of all mental disorders, affecting just under 1 % of the population. While its etiological bases remain obscure and consequently its nosological boundaries are uncertain, the condition classically has its onset in childhood or early adolescence [1]. It is characterized by (1) \"positive\" psychotic symptoms like delusions (fixed false ideas that are held with unshakable conviction), hallucinations (perceptions without a stimulus), and thought disorder (difficulty in assembling a coherent stream of speech); (2) so-called negative symptoms like lack of motivation and pleasure, inability of expressing the full range of emotions, neglect of personal appearance, and disinterest in life events; and (3) cognitive impairment (memory and attention difficulties) [2]. All of these attributes, persistent over time, culminate in a decline in social and occupational performance. These features – coupled with the consequences of sustained impairment – result in comorbid depression (see chapter \" Major depressive disorder \") among people with schizophrenia. Approximately 50 % of patients attempt and about 4 % of patients commit suicide. Schizophrenia is poorly understood by the public, and it is often highly stigmatizing [3].",

Estima-se que no Brasil existam 17 mil novos casos por ano, sendo considerado problema social e de saúde pública. A hemiparesia se caracteriza por espasticidade no hemicorpo contralateral ao hemisfério cerebral afetado. A marcha hemiparética não apresenta o toque do calcâneo no iní­cio do apoio bipodal pela incapacidade do músculo tibial anterior em produzir tensão suficiente para realizar o movimento de dorsiflexão. A fase de impulsão também fica comprometida em decorrência da fraqueza do músculo trí­ceps sural, constituindo fator limitante para a marcha. Estudos morfológicos sugerem que a fraqueza do músculo parético é mais incapacitante que a espasticidade, ela ocorre devido ao desuso, perda de unidades motoras, alteração na ordem do recrutamento, tornando-se necessário o fortalecimento desta musculatura para melhorar a capacidade de geração de força e habilidade motora. A estimulação elétrica funcional (FES) promove fortalecimento com possibilidade de redução da assimetria cortical, pois envolve processos relacionados í movimentação voluntária. O objetivo do presente estudo é comparar os efeitos da FES na funcionalidade da marcha em pacientes com PC após sua aplicação nos músculos tibial anterior e trí­ceps sural. Os resultados obtidos pela escala GMFM constataram maior evolução no paciente que recebeu a FES no músculo trí­ceps sural, assim como melhora da ADM passiva e aumento de força muscular de dorsiflexores e plantiflexores, redução do grau de espasticidade e evolução nas variáveis da marcha. Desta forma a FES demonstrou resultados positivos no tratamento de musculatura espástica com evolução na funcionalidade da marcha.Palavras-chave: paralisia cerebral, estimulação elétrica funcional, hemiparesia, espasticidade.Â",

The clinical picture may for a long time be dominated by disturbances of posture and gait (the myostatic phase of Wechsler and Brock<sup>2</sup>) before muscular restlessness becomes evident. Such cases do not even suggest dystonia and therefore are usually labeled hysteria, chorea, athetosis or some other form of muscular restlessness. Because dystonia resembles some other clinical manifestations, there is a tendency to discard it as a clinical entity. According to others, dystonia not only is a clinical entity but exhibits definite pathologic changes in some basal ganglions—caudate nucleus and putamen (corpus striatum).

      "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is seen by the insurance industry and many health care providers as an \"event.\" Once treated and provided with a brief period of rehabilitation, the perception exists that patients with a TBI require little further treatment and face no lasting effects on the central nervous system or other organ systems. In fact, TBI is a chronic disease process, one that fits the World Health Organization definition as having one or more of the following characteristics: it is permanent, caused by non-reversible pathological alterations, requires special training of the patient for rehabilitation, and/or may require a long period of observation, supervision, or care. TBI increases long-term mortality and reduces life expectancy. It is associated with increased incidences of seizures, sleep disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, neuroendocrine dysregulation, and psychiatric diseases, as well as non-neurological disorders such as sexual dysfunction, bladder and bowel incontinence, and systemic metabolic dysregulation that may arise and/or persist for months to years post-injury. The purpose of this article is to encourage the classification of TBI as the beginning of an ongoing, perhaps lifelong process, that impacts multiple organ systems and may be disease causative and accelerative. Our intent is not to discourage patients with TBI or their families and caregivers, but rather to emphasize that TBI should be managed as a chronic disease and defined as such by health care and insurance providers. Furthermore, if the chronic nature of TBI is recognized by government and private funding agencies, research can be directed at discovering therapies that may interrupt the disease processes months or even years after the initiating event.",

      "abstract": "A neuropsychiatric and -psychological update of the crime \"profile\" and \"signature\" is a necessary addition to the traditional sociopsychological model likely to miss limbic system dysfunctioning. Thus, occurrence of a brief (c. 20 minutes) limbic seizure has been proposed based on behaviors of 12 white male homicidal loners, who showed a dozen symptoms and signs: Limbic Psychotic Trigger Reaction. Readily overlooked can be (a) a transient psychosis (hallucinations and/or delusions), (b) autonomic hyperactivation (e.g., loss of bladder control, nausea, ejaculation), (c) motiveless, out-of-character, unplanned, and well-remembered homicidal acts, (d) committed with a flat affect (not emotionally or impulsively provoked), (e) typically involving a stranger who happened to provide an objectively harmless and only subjectively important stimulus. (f) Such an individualized stimulus triggered the memory revival of mild to moderate but repeatedly experienced hurts. Such a specific sequence of events implicates the specific mechanism of limbic seizure, \"kindling,\" which does not necessarily involve motor convulsions. Repetition of such limbic episodes with \"criminal acts\" is conceivable under specific circumstances including cases in which the triggering stimulus is associated with pleasurable delusions (e.g., of grandiose power or wealth) or constitutes a specific aspect of a basic drive motive.

      "abstract": "Neuropathic pain is a type of chronic pain that arises due to damage or dysfunction in the nervous system. Unlike pain caused by tissue damage, neuropathic pain results from nerve issues, which can stem from injuries to the spinal cord, brain, or peripheral nerves [1]. In athletic activities, athletes may encounter various types of injuries that can lead to neuropathic pain. Sports involving intense physical contact or rapid movements pose the highest risk of causing this type of pain. For instance, spinal cord injuries, which can occur in sports like football or gymnastics, can directly affect spinal nerves and lead to neuropathic pain [2]. On the other hand, sports such as tennis or basketball, which require repetitive movements and continuous pressure on muscles and joints, can damage peripheral nerves and result in neuropathic pain [3]. Additionally, concussions, commonly seen in sports like boxing or football, are another frequent cause of this type of pain [4]. Direct blows to the head can disrupt the functioning of the brain and nerves, leading to symptoms of neuropathic pain. These symptoms may manifest as burning, tingling, numbness, or sudden shooting pain in the affected areas and may sometimes be mistaken for muscle or joint pain. Diagnosing neuropathic pain in athletes can be challenging, as this pain develops gradually and is chronic. For an accurate diagnosis, physicians often use techniques such as nerve conduction studies or imaging scans [5].",

      "abstract": "Trichotillomania is categorized as an Impulse-Control Disorder. The following article brings to light that this disorder man not be as rare as some clinicians think. The following discussion delineates Trichotillomania in terms of its descriptive characteristics, onset and course, associated disorders, relationship to Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, and treatment. Research indicates a combination of psychopharmacology and cognitive-behavioral therapy as the choice of treatment for this disorder. Following the content discussion of Trichotillomania is a transcript of an interview with one of the authors (K. A.) who was previously diagnosed with Trichotillomania. INTRODUCTION Trichotillomania is categorized as an Impulse-Control Disorder and is defined by the following five criteria listed in the DSM-IV (1994): a) recurrent pulling of one's hair resulting in noticeable hair loss, b) an increasing sense of tension immediately before pulling out the hair or when attempting to resist the behavior, c) pleasure, gratification, or relief when pulling out the hair, d) the disturbance is not better accounted for by another mental disorder and is not due to a general medical condition, e) the disturbance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. (p. 621) This article seeks to provide an overview of Trichotillomania in terms of its history and descriptive characteristics, onset and course of illness, associated disorders, its relationship to Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder, and the treatment of choice for Trichotillomania. HISTORY AND DESCRIPTIVE CHARACTERISTICS History In 1889 a French dermatologist, Hallopeau, described a man who pulled out his hair in large amounts (Swedo, 1993). Hallopeau used the term trichotillomania to describe this behavior. Before Hallopeau's encounter with his client, references to hair-pulling had already been documented. In 1779, Baudament reported on a 16-year-old boy who pulled out his hair and actually ate it. Eventually, this ingestion of hair led to gastrointestinal problems because the boy developed hair balls in his stomach (Christenson & Mackenzie, 1994). Once thought to be rare, this disorder is far from uncommon. It has been estimated that approximately eight million Americans are afflicted with this disorder (Azrin & Nunn, 1978). A survey conducted by Rothbaum, Shaw, Morris, and Ninan (1993) revealed that of the 490 college freshman respondents, 10% reported compulsive hair-pulling. Despite these statistics, the literature is very scarce regarding this disorder. Characteristics Trichotillomania is predominately found in the female population. Christenson, Mackenzie, and Mitchell (1991) found that 93% of 60 adult chronic hair-pullers were women. Likewise, Swedo and Leonard (1992) found that 70% of 43 sampled children, adolescents, and adults who were chronic hair-pullers were female. Christenson and Mackenzie (1994) found a more equal sex ratio in children under the age of six. Hair-pulling can occur from many body locations. A study done by Swedo and Leonard (1992) found that the most common area from which hair is pulled is the scalp, followed by eyelashes, eyebrows, pubis, body (arm/leg), and face (beard). Most individuals pluck hair from at least two sites, with sites varying over time. Those diagnosed with this disorder typically think that the hair that is pulled is somehow different from other hair. For example, chronic hair-pullers may pluck kinky or course hair so that they may feel right about their hair, thus reducing anxiety (Swedo & Rapoport, 1991.). After the hair is pulled, other ritualistic acts can follow. For instance, some individuals will play with or twirl their extracted hair, while others may brush it against their cheeks or lips. Some individuals will even go as far as ingesting their hair (trichophagia), possibly leading to gastrointestinal difficulties or even death (Swedo & Leonard, 1992). …",

      "abstract": "The progressive myoclonus epilepsies (PMEs) are a devastating group of rare disorders(1) that manifest with increasing action myoclonus, which is also present at rest but activates with stimuli such as noise, light, or touch. Ultimately, patients become wheelchair-bound and experience early death. Neurologic signs that frequently but not reliably coexist include other seizure types (particularly generalized tonic-clonic), progressive ataxia, and dementia. Typically, presentation is in late childhood or adolescence; however, all ages may be affected. Although distinction from more common forms of genetic generalized epilepsy, particularly juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, may be challenging early on, the presence or evolution of 1) progressive neurologic disability, 2) failure to respond to antiepileptic drug therapy, and 3) background slowing on EEG should suggest PME. Importantly, inappropriate therapy in the genetic generalized epilepsies may result in ataxia, impaired cognition, and uncontrolled seizures, which may mimic PME. PMEs should be distinguished from progressive encephalopathies with seizures (due to degenerative conditions such as GM2 gangliosidosis, nonketotic hyperglycinemia, Niemann-Pick type C, juvenile Huntington and Alzheimer disease) and progressive myoclonic ataxias, which affect predominantly adults with progressive ataxia, myoclonus, few if any tonic-clonic seizures, and without evidence of dementia.(2,3.)",

      "title": "Movement disorders in patients with peripheral facial palsy",
      "abstract": "Abstract Acute unilateral facial paralysis is usually a benign neurological condition that resolves in a few weeks. However, it can also be the source of a transient or long‐lasting severe motor dysfunction, featuring disorders of automatic and voluntary movement. This review is organized according to the two most easily recognizable phases in the evolution of facial paralysis: (1) Just after presentation of facial palsy, patients may exhibit an increase in their spontaneous blinking rate as well as a sustained low‐level contraction of the muscles of the nonparalyzed side, occasionally leading to blepharospasm‐like muscle activity. This finding may be due to an increase in the excitability of facial motoneurons and brainstem interneurons mediating trigeminofacial reflexes. (2) If axonal damage has occurred, axonal regeneration beginning at approximately 3 months after the lesion leads inevitably to clinically evident or subclinical hyperactivity of the previously paralyzed hemifacial muscles. The full‐blown postparalytic facial syndrome consists of synkinesis, myokymia, and unwanted hemifacial mass contractions accompanying normal facial movements. The syndrome has probably multiple pathophysiological mechanisms, including abnormal axonal branching after aberrant axonal regeneration and enhanced facial motoneuronal excitability. Although the syndrome is relieved with local injections of botulinum toxin, fear of such uncomfortable contractions may lead the patients to avoid certain facial movements, with the implications that this behavior might have on their emotional expressions. © 2003 Movement Disorder Society",

      "abstract": "Task‐specific dystonias are primary focal dystonias characterized by excessive muscle contractions producing abnormal postures during selective motor activities that often involve highly skilled, repetitive movements. Historically these peculiar postures were considered psychogenic but have now been classified as forms of dystonia. Writer's cramp is the most commonly identified task‐specific dystonia and has features typical of this group of disorders. Symptoms may begin with lack of dexterity during performance of a specific motor task with increasingly abnormal posturing of the involved body part as motor activity continues. Initially, the dystonia may manifest only during the performance of the inciting task, but as the condition progresses it may also occur during other activities or even at rest. Neurological exam is usually unremarkable except for the dystonia‐related abnormalities. Although the precise pathophysiology remains unclear, increasing evidence suggests reduced inhibition at different levels of the sensorimotor system. Symptomatic treatment options include oral medications, botulinum toxin injections, neurosurgical procedures, and adaptive strategies. Prognosis may vary depending upon body part involved and specific type of task affected. Further research may reveal new insights into the etiology, pathophysiology, natural history, and improved treatment of these conditions.",

      "abstract": "Definitions and Epidemiology A seizure is a sudden, paroxysmal discharge of a population of neurons that causes a transient alteration in neurologic function. This alteration may involve abnormal motor activity, sensory symptoms, a change in the level of alertness, alteration in autonomic function, or any combination of these. When a seizure occurs in the neonatal period, several special considerations arise (Table 1). A seizure in a newborn almost always reflects significant nervous system pathology, and recognizing and treating seizures properly may prevent subsequent chronic neurologic impairment. It is important not to confuse seizures with epilepsy. A seizure is a single event and may be due to a transient abnormality that will not recur (eg, hypoglycemia). Epilepsy is the condition of unprovoked recurrent seizures. Many neonatal seizures are transient events that will not progress to epilepsy. Ictal refers to clinical (based on visual observation) or electrical (based on the electroencephalogram [EEG]) activity occurring during a seizure (Table 2). Seizures occur in about 0.2% to 1.4% of all newborns. However, the incidence is much higher among certain high-risk groups. About 20% of newborns whose birthweight is less than 2500 g have seizures, with a higher incidence among sicker preterm infants. Incidence also depends on etiology; as many as 50% of newborns who have severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) develop neonatal seizures.",

It has become a paradigmatic psychiatric disorder while remaining something of an enigma. Defined by a syndrome of psychotic phenomena (positive phenomena such as delusions, hallucinations or disordered thought structure) and negative features resulting from motivation and emotional dysfunction, schizophrenia is defined by symptoms lasting at least 4 weeks and impairment for 6 months or more [1, 2]. Where the illness is short-lived, the clinical syndrome is defined as a schizophrenia-related diagnosis [1]. The clinical presentation usually encompasses features prominent in other psychiatric conditions such as cognitive dysfunction, motor abnormalities, obsessional phenomena or depression. These additional features not included in the definition of schizophrenia underscore its pervasive neural dysfunction; they influence management and often shape the clinical outcome. The seeds of schizophrenia may be sown in early life with aberrant childhood development in multiple domains [2], but the clinical syndrome typically presents in early adulthood (Figure 9.10.1); abnormal neural connectivity may underly these seemingly remote phenomena.",

      "title": "Somatisation as a manifestation of emotional disturbance in children",
      "abstract": "Somatisation is a phenomenon consisting in signalling complaints originating “from the body” (pain, discomfort, disturbances of physiological functions), whose cause is not explained on the basis of physical examination and additional examinations, and whose basis is usually an unconscious emotional factor. The most common somatic manifestations of negative emotions include abdominal pain, headache, palpitations or stabbing sensation in the chest, dizziness, shortness of breath, cough, squeezing sensation in the throat, numbness of limbs, as well as diarrhoea, vomiting or fainting. Although the described type of disorder occurs particularly often in people burdened with other mental problems, such as anxiety, depression or personality disorders, nowadays it is observed more and more often in children not showing any psychogenic abnormalities so far. A significant influence on the development of such symptoms has the environment of upbringing, from which the developing person draws behavioural patterns. In addition, the entire general social context with all its conditions, both positive and negative, is important. In the case of children, due to the lack of possibility of regular and constructive self-observation, developed abstract thinking and conscious, consistent verbalisation of inner experiences by the patient, the process of diagnosis and therapy of such disorders often requires diagnostic hospitalisation, multi-specialist consultations, long-term treatment in the outpatient mode, as well as at least partial modification of environmental relations, including the educational process. The fundamental issue remains the protection of mental health in the form of preventive measures aimed at creating existential conditions that have a positive impact on the mental development of children, which is particularly true of relations between generations.",

Todas ellas engloban diversas actividades ludicas en la que uno ya puede estar familiarizado pero que cimientan una probable ludopatia. No por el mero acto de empezar a jugar, si no por la posibilidad de no poder detenerse. La ludopatia o juego patologico se refiere al comportamiento desadaptativo, repetido y persistente de juego por dinero (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2005) que expone a la persona a consecuencias negativas en el plano social, profesional e individual; no es una tarea ni esta impuesto por una urgencia fisica ni moral como si fuera una necesidad real (Kuten, 2006). En este trastorno, las repercusiones se hacen sentir de gran forma en la familia del jugador, la cual recibe los embates del flagelo economico y personal que esta enfermedad implica y conlleva. El DSM-IV-TR la considera como la adiccion de los anos noventa y aquella con mayor frecuencia entre los trastornos del control de impulsos. De este aspecto cabe senalar tres visiones generales formuladas sobre la base de esta enfermedad: por un lado es considerada como trastorno del control de impulsos (APA, 2005) debido la alta impulsividad asociada (Grant & Kim, 2003) la cual se refleja en esta incapacidad por mantener el control sobre el juego y su detencion; por otro lado encontramos con que se le considera como una adiccion no toxica puesto que posee caracteristicas similares a la drogodependencia (Choliz, 2006) como lo vendria siendo:",

Although the spasticity and dystonia symptoms are caused by different pathophysiological mechanisms, both of them may cause functional impairment that contributes to a poor quality of life. Spasticity is characterised by a velocity-dependent increase in tonic stretch reflexes with exaggerated tendon jerks, resulting from hyperexcitability of the stretch reflex. It mostly occurs in disorders of the central nervous system (CNS) affecting the upper motor neurons, such as multiple sclerosis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, cerebrovascular diseases, cerebral palsy, traumatic brain injury, stroke, and spinal cord injury. Therapeutic options may combine, in various proportions, physical therapy, occupational therapy, self-rehabilitation, the use of orthoses and assistive devices, drug treatment, orthopaedic surgery, and neurosurgery. Dystonia is defined as a syndrome of involuntary movement that manifests as excessive muscle contractions that frequently cause twisting and repetitive movements or abnormal postures. It is often intensified or exacerbated by physical activity, and symptoms may progress into adjacent muscles. Dystonia has many different manifestations and causes, and many different treatment options are available. These options include physical and occupational therapy, oral medications, intramuscular injection of botulinum toxins, and neurosurgical interventions.",

Anxiety disorders are the most common group of mental illnesses together with sleep disorders and astheno-neurotic syndrome [3]. Anxiety accompanies the course of many mental and somatic diseases [4]. It usually appears early in life, causes cumulative damage, and can contribute to depression, substance abuse, and other adverse outcomes [5]. Sleep disturbances and anxiety are frequent competing or synergistic symptoms. The onset and development of these conditions are often interrelated. In addition, these conditions often correlate with the appearance and course of other disorders - such as depression, dementia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Long-term, uncorrected disturbances of circadian rhythms lead to clinically significant distress and cause mental, physical, social, professional, educational, or other functional impairments [6].",

      "title": "[Current and emerging features of obsessive-compulsive disorder--trends for the revision of DSM-5].",
      "abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized as significant impairment of cognitive-behavioral inhibition, which is causally associated with cognitive processes evoking anxiety, along with increased desire for perfect control over the possible harm, at least in typical OCD patients who have compulsions in response to obsessions. However, OCD has been well conceptualized as a multidimensional and heterogeneous disorder apparently comprising a number of potentially valid subtypes. For example, OCD can be diagnosed by either obsessions or compulsions, and a certain type of OCD patient has only compulsions in response to rules that must be applied rigidly. They often become stuck as a result of rigid rules in every step of their daily working and social life. This type of compulsive behavior is often triggered by specific sensory phenomena such as sight, touch, or personal expression (e. g. need to express himself precisely in written or spoken words). Thus, such OCD patients usually perform their compulsions in order to relieve sensory phenomena such as feelings of incompleteness and urges to reach a specific sensation of feeling \"just right\", and are less likely to have obsessions or cognitive processes preceding the repetitive behaviors. This type of OCD has also been characterized as \"tic-related\" and tends to have comorbid conditions such as tic disorders, ADHD or skin picking. Indeed, there are some crucial and significant differences in the psychopathology, phenomenology, and putative biological bases between OCD patients with obsession-related compulsions (cognitive type) and those with compulsions repeated according to rigid rules (motoric type). Because of the substantial heterogeneity of OCD, it seems to be beyond the traditional learning model in which anxiety-driven obsessions entrain neutralizing compulsions and also beyond the essential features of anxiety disorders commonly characterized by psychopathological characteristics such as marked and persistent fear, expectant anxiety, fear conditioning, avoidance, and cognitive process to evoke anxiety et al. Eventually, it has caused dramatic changes of view on the core psychopathology of OCD that is based on \"preoccupation\" and \"repeated behaviors\" as a failure of behavioral (cognitive and motor) inhibition, which also constitutes a key characteristic of obsessive-compulsive and related disorders (OCRDs) in process of the revision of DSM-5. The precise nature and compass of this spectrum remains to be fully elucidated, but a preliminary approach emphasizes that putative OCRDs have phenomenological (e.g. repetitive thoughts or behaviors), etiological, psychobiological or treatment overlap with OCD, differentiating OCD from other anxiety disorders. Therefore, OCRDs, including OCD, may be classified apart from other anxiety disorders in the revisions of DSM-5 or ICD-11. Nevertheless, recent neuroimaging evidence points to the critical involvement of the lateral and medial orbitofrontal cortices, the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and amygdalo cortical circuitry, in addition to cortico-striatal circuitry, in the pathophysiology of OCD, suggesting the possibility that fear extinction, in addition to behavioral inhibition, might be impaired in OCD similarly to other anxiety disorders. Moreover, studies have investigated the relevant neurocircuitry, neurochemistry, and neuroendocrinology commonly underlying depression, anxiety disorders and OCRDs, and have explored the underlying genetic basis of and relevant intermediate phenotypes for developing these conditions. Thus more research is needed to elucidate the essential relationships among these disorders and to validate the future diagnostic classifications of anxiety disorders.",

      "abstract": "The appearance preoccupations trigger feelings of depression, anxiety, distress, shame, or other painful emotions. These emotions, in turn, trigger repetitive compulsive behaviors that are intended to alleviate the emotional distress [5] . As required by DSM-5 criterion B (which is new to DSM-5), all individuals with BDD perform excessive repetitive behaviors in response to the preoccupations with appearance at some time during the course of the disorder [1] . These repetitive behaviors have many similarities to OCD compulsions, and thus they are commonly referred to as compulsions or rituals. Common excessive behaviors include checking mirrors, excessive grooming, seeking reassurance about the perceived defects, skin picking (to try to minimize perceived blemishes), and tanning (e.g. to darken ‘pale’ skin) [3] . Some BDD compulsions consist of mental acts, such as comparing one’s own appearance with that of other people, rather than observable behaviors [3] . The repetitive behaviors are difficult to control and occur, on average, for 3–8 h a day [4, 5] . Nearly all patients camouflage the perceived defects (e.g. with a hat, makeup, hair, clothes, body position). Although camouflaging is a safety behavior, it can also be done repeatedly (e.g. reapplying makeup 20 times a day), in which case it may be considered a repetitive behavior [3] . Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is common yet very under-recognized. It has a point prevalence of about 2%, making it more common than obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), anorexia nervosa or schizophrenia [1] . BDD typically causes tremendous suffering and substantial impairment in psychosocial functioning. The rates of suicidal ideation, suicide attempt and completed suicide appear markedly high. Yet treatment research on BDD lags very far behind that of other common and severe disorders. Thus, the study by Veale et al. [2] is a major contribution to the literature and to patient care. Individuals with BDD (previously known as ‘dysmorphophobia’) are preoccupied with one or more perceived defects or flaws in their appearance; these defects, however, are not observable or appear only slight to others (DSM-5 criterion A) [1] . Preoccupations most often focus on skin (e.g. perceived acne, scarring, wrinkles, color), nose (e.g. size or asymmetry) and hair (e.g. too little hair) but may focus on any body area [3] . Patients typically describe the disliked body parts as ‘ugly’, ‘unattractive’, ‘hideous’, or even ‘monstrous’. The preoccupations occur, on average, for 3–8 h a day (usually for at least an hour a day). They are intrusive, unwanted, and usually difficult to resist and control [4, 5] .

      "abstract": "A esclerose múltipla remitente-recorrente (EMRR) é uma doença neurológica autoimune, onde o sistema imunológico ataca a bainha de mielina do sistema nervoso central, causando inflamação que prejudica a transmissão dos impulsos nervosos. Caracteriza-se por episódios de surtos com exacerbação dos sintomas, como fadiga, fraqueza em membros inferiores e superiores, tremores e equilíbrio dificuldade para andar, perda de visão, entre outros, seguidos de remissões com recuperação parcial ou completa, que podem durar meses ou anos, durante os quais a progressão da doença é mínima ou ausente. A insônia ou baixa qualidade de sono pode ocorrer indiretamente como consequência da EMRR. Ou seja, um sintoma secundário que é acarretado pela presença dos sintomas específicos da doença e dos pseudo surtos. A Percepção Corporal (PC) pode ser definida de duas maneiras, como Imagem Corporal (IC) e Esquema Corporal (EC). A IC está relacionada ao aspecto psíquico, emocional, cognitivo, sociocultural, evolucionário, genético e neurocientífico, em relação a expectativa da imagem de seu corpo. O EC é a perspectiva que possibilita, por meio de mecanismos cinestésicos e proprioceptivos, o reconhecimento do corpo anatômico e da relação que este estabelece com o meio e com os objetos a sua volta. Diante destas definições, surgiu a oportunidade para relacionar a qualidade de sono com a percepção corporal e os quadros sintomatológicos. Sendo assim, o objetivo do estudo foi analisar a relação entre a qualidade do sono e a percepção corporal, pelo aspecto do esquema corporal e os quadros sintomatológicos da esclerose múltipla. Participaram 18 pessoas, entre 21 e 67 anos, que foram avaliados quanto à qualidade do sono pelo questionário de Pittsburgh, à percepção corporal pelo Teste de Askevold, e aos sintomas por meio de uma entrevista estruturada. Os resultados indicaram que todos os participantes com sono adequado foram classificados como hiperesquemáticos, enquanto 67% dos que apresentaram sono inadequado foram classificados como hipoesquemáticos. Além disso, indivíduos com sono inadequado mostraram uma distribuição equilibrada entre sintomas motores e sensitivos, enquanto aqueles com sono adequado relataram predominantemente sintomas sensitivos. A fadiga foi um sintoma relevante em 67% dos indivíduos com sono inadequado. Esses achados sugerem que a qualidade do sono pode estar associada à percepção corporal e à manifestação dos sintomas na EMRR, destacando a importância de intervenções que melhorem o sono para o manejo dessa condição.",

The children with cerebral palsy can also have some others damages such as vision, learning, sense or speech damages, intellectual damage, epilepsy, feeding disorders and so on. Cerebral palsy can be divided into four types: spastic, choreoatetotic, ataxic and mixed type. All limbs can be affected, that is, both arms and legs (quadriplegic), or mostly just the legs (diplexia), or just a hand and a leg on one side of the body (hemiplegia). It can not be surely determinate which are the causes of cerebral palsy. The causes are not the complications during child birth, but different prenatal factors and indications, which are divided as prenatal, perinatal and postnatal. Also, there are mostly several causes, and not only one that leeds to the formation of cerebral palsy. Cerebral palsy symptoms can be detected already in early childhood. When detected, the doctors pediatricians and physiatrists will set the diagnosis and determine the necessary exercises. Very important factors for successful integration and active participation of people with cerebral palsy are family support and timely treatments. If needed, a child with cerebral palsy can have an assistant or a therapeutic dog. With a purpose to view more insight into the life and everyday activities of people with cerebral palsy, it has been done a research which has shown that most people with cerebral palsy dresses by themselves, do the hygiene by themselves, participate in housekeeping, but unfortunately most respondents are unemployed, have difficulties in living, and don't do the sports. The conclusions of the research pointed to the need for greats involvement of society in the implementation of activities aimed at improving the life of people with cerebral palsy.",

      "abstract": "Mild head injury is a quiet disorder. It is common, typically bloodless and without call for significant medical intervention. It seems even more quiet because the noise it does make (its symptoms) is often attributed to other causes. Nevertheless the disruption in coping capacity and attendent breakdown in usual behavioral patterns causes more psychosocial and academic‐economic hardship than have begun to be appreciated. Cognitive mental changes such as impairment in attention, memory, and information processing even when mild and apparently transient can produce altered patterns of achievement and self confidence with long lived reverberations. Emotional irritability and lethargy also produce a chain of reactions likely to outlive the primary source of the disruption. Add to this decreased frustration tolerance, increased fatigability, lowered resilence to stress and uncertainty as to the origin of these difficulties and one has recipe for prolonged impairment. Place these ingredients into the person of a child, with all a child's limits on autonomy and verbal self report and the result is a myriad of reported and unreported social, academic and even familial disruptions exacerbated by the common clinical failure of identification of their correct underlying etiology.",

      "abstract": "Courts have accepted that epileptics sometimes commit unlawful acts as a result of an epileptic seizure. Reasons for this unlawful behaviour may be found in the interictal, ictal and post-ictal phases of the seizure. Interictal aspects which are relevant to the form of epileptic automatism may be the person's natural tendencies, the same psychodynamic factors which determine the contents of dreams, the person's social background of violence and the contents of a person's thoughts immediately before a seizure. Ictal aspects include the specific part of the brain from which the seizure originates, the loss of integration of incoming sensorial stimuli with motor-emotional output, the loss of higher control associated with a reversion to primitive automatic behaviour and the emergence of repressed feelings and aggressive instincts. Post-ictal violent behaviour may stem from the epileptic's misinterpretation of well-meant attempts by bystanders to protect him or her against the consequences of his or her confused conduct--and is usually characterized by a clouded consciousness, paranoid ideas and hallucinations.",

      "title": "Neuro-Inflammation Modulation and Post-Traumatic Brain Injury Lesions: From Bench to Bed-Side",
      "abstract": "Head trauma is the most common cause of disability in young adults. Known as a silent epidemic, it can cause a mosaic of symptoms, whether neurological (sensory-motor deficits), psychiatric (depressive and anxiety symptoms), or somatic (vertigo, tinnitus, phosphenes). Furthermore, cranial trauma (CT) in children presents several particularities in terms of epidemiology, mechanism, and physiopathology-notably linked to the attack of an immature organ. As in adults, head trauma in children can have lifelong repercussions and can cause social and family isolation, difficulties at school, and, later, socio-professional adversity. Improving management of the pre-hospital and rehabilitation course of these patients reduces secondary morbidity and mortality, but often not without long-term disability. One hypothesized contributor to this process is chronic neuroinflammation, which could accompany primary lesions and facilitate their development into tertiary lesions. Neuroinflammation is a complex process involving different actors such as glial cells (astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes), the permeability of the blood-brain barrier, excitotoxicity, production of oxygen derivatives, cytokine release, tissue damage, and neuronal death. Several studies have investigated the effect of various treatments on the neuroinflammatory response in traumatic brain injury in vitro and in animal and human models. The aim of this review is to examine the various anti-inflammatory therapies that have been implemented.",

      "abstract": "The article considers the impact of anxiety on the qualitative characteristics of man and the problems of his theoretical research in the field of psychology.Theconcept of anxiety in psychology is the ability of a person to feel different discomforts depending on the experience in different situations. Everyone has a level of anxiety called temporary and normal. If a person wants, he can overcome it. And if anxiety persists for a long time, it will not be able to cope on its own, and this will have a negative impact on human health and disrupt normalcy. Increased levels of anxiety, along with the emergence of various diseases, lead to a significant decline in quality of life. There are psychological and physiological manifestations of anxiety, which are determined by certain methods in science. The most obvious of the psychological symptoms -obscure problems -unjustified tense experiences.In psychology, anxiety is an emotional state with a negative connotation. Anxiety is characterized by the expectation of something negative, such as an adverse outcome or adverse outcome. Anxiety is a person's experience in different situations (joy, sorrow, shame, anger, fear, etc.). Anxiety is associated with a mental state, which is a person's emotional state and various feelings that indicate anxiety. Anxiety is associated with a mental state, which is a person's emotional state and various feelings that indicate anxiety. Forexample: confusion, anxiety, excitement, indifference, impatience, delay, etc. There are other meanings of the mental state of anxiety, which are: depression -a shameful mental state accompanied by anxiety; Propaganda is a phenomenon that takes place notonly in a state of anxiety, but also in a state of anger and rage; grief is a state of mind accompanied by anxiety, worry, grief, mental state is a state of mind, violence is a state of mind, grief accompanied by long-term anxiety, etc., so anxiety is a double state of mind.",

      "abstract": "Idiopathic spasmodic torticollis is a form of focal dystonia affecting the neck. It is characterised by involuntary repetitive or sustained neck muscle contractions leading to abnormal head postures and impaired control of head movement.1-3 With an estimated prevalence of 9/100 0004 spasmodic torticollis is the most common focal dystonia. Onset peaks around the age of 40 and there is a female preponderance with a sex ratio of about 1.5:1.5 Symptoms typically start gradually over a period of days or weeks and remain largely confined to the neck although spread of dystonia to the face (blepharospasm, oromandibular dystonia), larynx (laryngeal dystonia), and arms (dystonic arm postures and writer's cramp), but not the legs, can occur.1 Abnormal head and neck postures in spasmodic torticollis cause considerable disability, often interfering with the patient's ability to work, and cause pain, social stigmatisation, and depression.6 Most cases are sporadic. However, a family history is reported in about 15% of patients1 and several families with more than four affected members have been described,7-12 all of whom showed autosomal dominant inheritance. Thus genetic factors seem to have some aetiological importance.\n\nThe pathophysiology of spasmodic torticollis is still unclear. In idiopathic spasmodic torticollis no structural lesions are found in the CNS. However, there are two lines of evidence that dysfunction of the basal ganglia plays a part. Firstly, spasmodic torticollis can be seen either in isolation or as part of a more widespread hemidystonia after lesions of the basal ganglia or its connections.13-16Secondly, it is sometimes part of the clinical presentation in generalised primary torsion dystonia,17 in which functional imaging data and neurophysiological studies have shown abnormalities in the basal ganglia and its projections.18-21 \n\nIf focal dystonias, including spasmodic torticollis, were solely caused by dysfunction of the basal …",

The usual environmental and psychological factors that influence maturation are modified by the attitudes of other persons toward the disabled one and by his own attitudes toward his defects and the limitations which they impose upon him. During the first few formative years, the normal child develops increasing physical independence as his motility and equilibrium patterns mature, enabling him to erect himself against gravity and to locomote independently. This growing capability is paralleled by the ego development and the appreciation of body image concept. The development of speech is a major step in communication and greatly facilitates the child's contact with his environment. The alteration of these patterns of maturation by central or peripheral neuromuscular disorders may influence profoundly the individual's personality. This results from the anxiety",

Порушення постави зустрічаютьсяне тільки у дітей шкільного віку, а й дошкільного віку, який збігається з критичними періо-дами росту і розвитку.

When an acute headache occurs repeatedly or episodically it is often a primary headache with migraine and tension-type headache being the most frequent cause in children and adolescents. A chronic or very frequent headache may be secondary to migraine. Headache disorders can affect the lifestyle of both the child and his or her family resulting in significant disability. This can include time lost from school and parental absence from work, while also affecting the child and parent interaction at home and the child’s social interaction with peers. The majority of children and adolescents with headache never consult a physician (Sillanpa¨a¨ et al., 1991).",

      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder or PTSD is an extreme psycho-physiological response disorder that may occur in individuals who are exposed to a potentially traumatic event that can involve the subjectively profound threat of loss... of life or limb. To receive a PTSD diagnosis, reactions to the catastrophic or traumatic stressor must involve profound fear, helplessness, or horror. Furthermore, such individuals have to experience symptoms from three separate yet co-occurring symptom clusters. These clusters or domains include: 1) intrusive recollections or the re-experiencing of the event with accompanied intense psychological distress or physiologic reactivity; 2) persistent avoidance of activities, thoughts as well as feelings associated with the traumatic event; and, 3) increased or extreme arousal that may include an exaggerated startle response, hypervigilance, or insomnia (American Psychiatric Association, 1994; Uddin et al., 2010) To justify a PTSD diagnosis, symptoms must be present for at least one month, and impair an individual’s interpersonal, occupational, or social functioning (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). PTSD has been described as a specific phenotype that develops as the result of a failure to contain the normal stress response (Yehuda & LeDoux, 2007), resulting in dysregulation of the hypothalamic– pituitary–adrenal or HPA axis, a major stress response system of the body that interacts with the immune system to maintain homeostasis (Wong, 2002). PTSD-affected and unaffected individuals have distinct expression patterns in genes involved in immune activation (Segman et al., 2005; Zieke et al., 2007), and in genes that encode neural and endocrine proteins (Segman et al., 2005; Yehuda et al., 2009). Above all, PTSD is both an external and internal experience; that is, PTSD is an external catastrophic or traumatic event and an internal psycho-physiological experience.",

Identify the important features of tics and stereotypies.\n\n2. Recognize comorbid conditions and overlapping qualities with tics.\n\n3. Describe treatment approaches for tic disorders.\n\nMovement disorders involve impairment of appropriate targeting and velocity of voluntary movements, dysfunction of posture, the presence of abnormal involuntary movements, or the performance of normal-appearing movements at inappropriate or unintended times. The abnormalities of movement are not due to weakness or abnormal muscle tone but may be accompanied by weakness or abnormal tone. By convention, movement disorders are divided into two major categories. The first category is hyperkinetic movement disorders, sometimes referred to as dyskinesias. This term refers to abnormal, repetitive involuntary movements and includes most of the childhood movement disorders, including tics, stereotypies, chorea, dystonia, myoclonus, and tremor. The second category is hypokinetic movement disorders, sometimes referred to as akinetic/rigid disorders. The primary movement disorder in this category is parkinsonism, manifesting primarily in adulthood as Parkinson disease or one of many forms of secondary parkinsonism. Hypokinetic disorders are relatively uncommon in children. Although ataxia, weakness, and spasticity are characterized by motor dysfunction, by common convention these entities are not included among “movement disorders.”\n\nThis review of movement disorders consists of two parts. Part I focuses on the most common movement disorders of childhood: tics and stereotypies. Part II examines chorea, dystonia, myoclonus, tremor, and drug-induced movement disorders.\n\nMost movement disorders in childhood arise from dysfunction in basal ganglia (caudate, putamen, globus pallidus, subthalamic nucleus, substantia nigra) and frontal cortex. However, the accomplishment of normal movement requires a multifaceted network of brain regions, including basal ganglia, frontal …",

The average child is very active physically, employs useless and exaggerated gestures and finds it difficult to concentrate on one thing for a prolonged period. As he grows he learns to control his motor impulses, becomes less active and more attentive and finally in his teens develops the ability to think before acting and is economical in the expenditure of his physical energy. The extent of normal physical overactivity and the time for the child to become less active vary widely with different children. Annoying as hyperactive behavior may be to parents, fortunately, in most instances, it is regarded as natural, as a phase in the child's development, and not much importance is attached to it. The child whose overactivity results in no particular problems will not be discussed. There is a type of child who, because",

There is ample epidemiological and experimental evidence that chemical and/or physical factors acting during sensitive time windows of the brain development can cause mental, behavioral, emotional and/or cognitive disorders. Environmental pollutants, addictive substances, drugs, malnutrition, excessive stress and/or hypoxia-ischemia were reported to induce functional maldevelopment of the brain with consequent neurobehavioral disorders.

Both types of tics are caused by sudden muscle contractions and share a similar pathophysiology. The most common presenting tic of childhood is probably eye blinking. Other simple motor tics include eye movements, mouth opening, facial grimacing, and neck jerking. More complex motor tics include slow and sustained (dystonic) movements such as brief torticollis, shoulder shrugs/rolls, and blepharospasm (forced eye closure). Simple vocal tics include sniffing, coughing, clearing the throat, and humming. More complex vocal tics include echolalia (repeating others' words), palilalia (repeating one's own words), and abnormal breathing patterns. Fortunately the most obtrusive tics such as coprolalia (obscene words) and copropraxia (obscene gestures) are not common, especially in childhood.",

      "abstract": "У статті розглядається питання необхідності дослідження особистісної саморегуляції в дітей із порушеннями інтелектуального розвитку. Ситуація в країні сприяє збільшенню травматичних стресів, які можуть мати серйозні наслідки для дітей із порушеннями психофізичного розвитку. Ці події порушують базове відчуття безпеки особистості дитини та можуть призвести до розвитку різних психічних проблем. Травматичний стрес може викликати травматичний стресовий синдром (ТСС) або посттравматичний стресовий розлад (ПТСР), які характеризуються різними симптомами, такими як повторні спогади про травматичну подію, проблеми зі сном, харчові розлади, депресія тощо. У дітей із порушеннями психофізичного розвитку ці симптоми можуть бути особливо вираженими та можуть потребувати специфічної та індивідуалізованої підтримки. Крім того, травматичні стреси можуть сприяти розвитку інших невротичних і психічних розладів, таких як тривожність, депресія, різноманітні фобії тощо. Ці розлади можуть значно ускладнити життя дитини й вимагати комплексного підходу до їх корекції та підтримки. Однією з важливих характеристик особистості дитини з порушенням інтелектуального розвитку є незрілість її емоційної сфери. Тому важливо вчасно виявляти та вирішувати проблеми, пов’язані з травматичним стресом, у дітей з порушеннями психофізичного розвитку. Саморегуляція вважається ключовою якістю особистості й важливим фактором гармонійних міжособистісних відносин у дітей із такими порушеннями як самих із собою, так і з оточуючим світом. Саморегуляція сприяє подоланню різноманітних перешкод, що заважають повноцінному включенню дитини в реальне життя, а також дозволяє розкрити її психологічний потенціал.",

      "abstract": "So EC: Facial nerve paralysis after cervical traction. Cervical traction is a frequently used treatment in rehabilitation clinics for cervical spine problems. This modality works, in principle, by decompressing the spinal cord or its nerve roots by applying traction on the cervical spine through a harness placed over the mandible (Olivero et al., Neurosurg Focus 2002;12:ECP1). Previous reports on treatment complications include lumbar radicular discomfort, muscle injury, neck soreness, and posttraction pain (LaBan et al., Arch Phys Med Rehabil 1992;73:295–6; Lee et al., J Biomech Eng 1996;118:597–600). Here, we report the first case of unilateral facial nerve paralysis developed after 4 wks of intermittent cervical traction therapy. Nerve conduction velocity examination revealed a peripheral-type facial nerve paralysis. Symptoms of facial nerve paralysis subsided after prednisolone treatment and suspension of traction therapy. It is suspected that a misplaced or an overstrained harness may have been the cause of facial nerve paralysis in this patient. Possible causes were (1) direct compression by the harness on the right facial nerve near its exit through the stylomastoid foramen; (2) compression of the right external carotid artery by the harness, causing transient ischemic injury at the geniculate ganglion; or (3) coincidental herpes zoster virus infection or idiopathic Bell's palsy involving the facial nerve.",

The stimuli are called stressors and physiological and behavioral changes in response to exposure to stressors constitute the stress response. A stress response is mediated by a complex interplay of nervous, endocrine, and immune mechanisms that involves activation of the sympathetic-adreno-medullar (SAM) axis, the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, and immune system. The stress response is adaptive, to begin with, that prepares the body to handle the challenges presented by an internal or external environmental challenge (stressor) e.g., the body's physiologic responses to trauma and invasive surgery serve to attenuate further tissue damage. But if the exposure to a stressor is actually or perceived as intense, repetitive (repeated acute stress), or prolonged (chronic stress), the stress response becomes maladaptive and detrimental to physiology e.g., exposure to chronic stressors can cause maladaptive reactions including depression, anxiety, cognitive impairment, and heart disease.",

A stroke occurs when there is a blockage or bleed in the vascular system of the brain, while a TBI results from an external force to the head. Older adults are at a higher risk of both stroke and TBI; thus, overall incidence is increasing as the proportion of older adults in the population is growing. Stroke and TBI result in immediate and long-term cognitive changes. Impairments in the domains of language, attention, memory, executive functions, perception, and social cognition have been documented following stroke and TBI. However, strokes tend to cause focal or selective cognitive disorders, while cognitive deficits following TBI are widespread and can be generalized. Individuals who have suffered a stroke or TBI may also experience psychosocial changes; for example, symptoms of depression and anxiety are common. Functional outcomes, including independence in activities, are varied and are associated with a range of factors including age, injury severity, cognitive disorders, and psychosocial factors. To achieve optimal outcomes for individuals following stroke and TBI, and to reduce the impact of the injury on everyday functioning, a multidisciplinary rehabilitation process is recommended.",

      "title": "Syncope: an overview of diagnosis and treatment",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Syncope is a syndrome in which a relatively sudden-onset, brief loss of consciousness results from a temporary self-terminating period of total cerebral hypoperfusion (1-4). In this regard, it is important to note that other conditions (e.g., epilepsy, concussions, metabolic disturbances and intoxications) may also cause a temporary loss of consciousness (TLOC) but nonetheless are not ‘syncope’ (3-5). Each of these differ from syncope either by the need for medical intervention to reverse the process (e.g., hypoglycemia) or by the underlying mechanism of the loss of consciousness (e.g., electrical disturbance in epilepsy, trauma in head injury, etc.) or both. Other conditionsmayalsomimic syncope. These are often termed ‘syncope mimics’ or ‘pseudosyncope’, but differ from syncope inasmuch as they do not cause true loss of consciousness (e.g., conversion reactions, malingering, and cataplexy). In itself, ‘syncope’ is not a complete diagnosis. Identifying the cause is important, since syncopemay be amarker of increasedmortality risk in some cases, but even more often may lead to physical injury resulting from falls or accidents, diminished quality-of-life, and possible restriction from employment or avocation. The goal should be to determine the cause of syncope with sufficient confidence to provide a reasonable assessment of prognosis, recurrence risk, and treatment options. The initial step is always the documentation of a comprehensive and detailed medical history (3-7). LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS Consciousness and ‘loss of consciousness’ (LOC) are complex concepts, but most physicians have a working understanding of what ismeant (8). Essentially, LOC implies not only loss of awareness and appropriate responsiveness to external stimuli, but also loss of postural tone. Occasionally, however, symptoms may suggest that ‘syncope’ is imminent, but the full clinical picture does not evolve at that time; such cases are often termed ‘near-syncope’. In such instances, the patient may experience near loss of vision (‘grey-out’ due principally to transient loss of blood supply to the retina), diminution of hearing, and feeling ‘out-of-touch’ with their surroundings and/or confused. On the other hand, many times patients complain of less well defined symptoms such as “dizziness” or “lightheadedness”. These latter complaints (especially in the elderly)may be due to an illdefined functional cerebral dysfunction triggered by transient hypotension (perhaps not severe enough to cause TLOC), but in most cases it is believed that such symptoms are not related to either ‘syncope’ or ‘nearsyncope’, and shouldnot be reported as such.",

Breath-holding attacks are relatively common and are an important problem. Although the attacks are not serious and the prognosis is usually good, parents often fear that their child may die during an attack. Parents therefore require explanation and reassurance from health professionals. Conduct disorders (often referred to as antisocial behaviours), such as aggression to others or theft, are more serious as they tend to be repetitive and persistent behaviours where the basic rights of others are violated. Emotional problems, such as anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder tend to occur in later childhood, and are often unrecognised because young children often find it difficult to express their emotions, or it may go unnoticed by the child's parents. This article briefly discusses the most common behavioural problems, including autism, that affect children of all ages.",

Behavioral symptoms occurring related to use of psychoactive substances Common Psychiatric Emergencies Suicide : Suicide can be defined as intentional self inflicted death. There are three terms frequently used while discussing suicide: suicidal ideation or intent, suicidal attempt or attempted suicide, and completed suicide. Suicide, as such, means completed suicide. Delirium: Transient disorder of brain function manifested by global cognitive impairment, alteration of consciousness and behavioral disturbances. Alcohol Related Emergencies: It is maladaptive behavior after the recent consumption of alcohol. Blood serum alcohol levels range from 10-20 mg/dl in patients who have pathological intoxication to 400- 500 mg/dl or more in patients who are obtunded or near death. Others include:- Delirium Tremens, Psychiatric Emergencies in Disaster Survivors, Rape and Sexual Abuse etc.",

First-rank symptoms consist of rapid, involuntary jerking movements, or chorea, due to lesions in the putamen and the caudate nucleus, and a progressive dementia due to loss of cells in the cerebral cortex (Hayden 1981). Onset of symptoms is typically in the third or fourth decade, and the clinical course is progressive and relentless over a period of 10 to 30 years. At autopsy, gross examination of HD brains reveals severe, symmetrical atrophy of the frontal and temporal lobes as well as, to a lesser degree, the parietal and occipital lobes. The caudate nucleus is profoundly involved, and diffuse neuronal loss extends into the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, thalamus, and spinal motor neurons. Various neurotransmitter systems have also been shown to be progressively affected (Rosenberg 1986).",

      "title": "Positive Psychological Aspects on Posttraumatic Stress Disorder after Traumatic Brain Injury.",
      "abstract": "Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a serious condition which occurs in a person who has experienced a traumatic injury in which serious physical harm was experienced [1]. PTSD is a collection of traumatic ordeals which causes fear, anger, or horror, an accident, war, natural disaster or unexpected death of a loved one. Also, families of victims will show the PTSD. Most people, who experienced a traumatic event, will have reactions of shock, fear, anger and even guilt. These feelings will increase and continue, becoming strong and keep the person of having a normal life. PTSD after traumatic brain injury is rare and must be examined in relation to co-morbidities and other risk factors [2]. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) occurs through sudden jolt to the head. Anyone can get the brain injury at any age. The most common causes of brain injury are closed to:- Head  injury  due  to  falls, road  traffic accidents, violation and assaults - Stroke - Subarachnoid haemorrhage - Hypoglycemia - Cerebral hypoxia which is prolonged  to  cardiac arrest - Cerebral infections - Carbon monoxide poisoning \r\n\r\nThese events occur suddenly with no warning. It often occurs under traumatic conditions. When the brain injury occurred can result to cognitive and physical disabilities. To challenge with acquired brain injury, there is a need to heal the associate cognitive, mental and emotional problems of the patient. A person with brain injury has major problems such as memory, concentration, empathic feelings, and difficulty in speaking. Perhaps, the most aspect which upset him is the combination of losses that effect on personal identity [3]. \r\n\r\nThe only one way to focusing on positive aspect is identify and recognizing of existing identity strength. Also, it is possible to recognize positive aspect of current situation. It could be involved of processes that range of simple comparison such as: “I walk lameness”, but since I have seen other people who are not able to walk at all, I realized how lucky I am”. “I have made some really good friends in hospital, but now as I think, I realized that family comes first before work.” \r\n\r\nPeople who have got brain injury may need permission to represent these types of idea and help to regulate them. Psychotherapy approaches to people who have brain injury need to be more directive than other groups. It is because that these peoples have more difficulty in generating these ideas due to the problems with administrative function from frontal lobe damage. They will benefit from quick alternative questions rather than obvious approach in formal psychotherapy practice [4].\r\n\r\nFocusing on positive aspects and approach can completely change the tone of a therapeutic collision and will light the mood of both patient and therapist. It seems that positive thinking to patients who have got brain injury is better than that administering the hint of depression. Patients will tend to leave the feeling of sadness and anxiety. To work with people who have got brain injury and have poor memory, the emotional tone is very important [5]. \r\n\r\nThe people with brain injury should accept and deal with the stress in their life. After treating bruises and bumps in hospital, people should going back to work and school and have normal life. People may have some trouble with work or school, but it is normal and could be frustrating. Therefore, thinking positive on posttraumatic stress after brain injury can support healing and fights depression and anxiety and allows the person to buildup healthy coping skills. Positive thinking also will strengthen immunity and help to fight with illnesses. The best method to positive thinking is replacing negative thoughts with positive. Most people are focusing on negatives and burst problems in their mind. They will imagine the worst things that happen. Positive thinking can be used to heal the problems and avoid thinking negative. Also, persons can surrounded him/her with positive peoples who will be able to support the patient mind. Therefore it is better to change the negative thoughts to positive which it will become automatically reaction.",

Ataxia is the most important sign of cerebellar disease. Cerebellar ataxia is defined as lack of accuracy or coordination of movement which is not due to paresis, alteration in tone, loss of postural sense or the presence of involuntary movements (DeJong, 1979). Cerebellar ataxia relates to motor dysfunctions of the limbs, trunk, eyes, and bulbar musculature. Ataxia of gait refers to incoordination of walking, which might be so severe that the patient cannot walk (abasia). Postural ataxia refers to ataxia of stance and sitting and includes truncal ataxia.The patient may be unable to sit or stand without support (astasia). Limb ataxia refers to incoordination of limb movements and ataxia of speech to cerebellar dysarthia.",

      "title": "Cannabidiol (CBD): An Innovative Pharmacological Treatment For Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD)",
      "abstract": "Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is characterized by recurring and repetitious thoughts coupled to anxiety characterized by obsessive thoughts and associated compulsive behavior(s). The OCD patient often fears that the anxiety will not abate and obsessional thoughts will control her/his mind or body in advocating or carrying out unwanted compulsive behaviors. Such thinking patterns or behaviors may often be frightening but usually they are quite harmless except when promoting accompanying anxiogenic activity. Confused thinking may be severe enough to cause functional impairments when obsessions or compulsions dominate mental status. In OCD, disrupted thoughts and actions may dominate the normal conduct of everyday tasks. Anxiety caused by obsessive thoughts is usually relieved by time-consuming and significant effort-requiring compulsive behaviors. Compulsive activities like diversionary counting, checking behavior (e.g., like repeatedly checking whether the stove is on or off), or excessive cleaning activity dominate the response to obsessive thoughts. Excessive hand washing (sometimes called the Pontius Pilot Syndrome) occurring as a compulsive behavior, not only relieves the causal obsession but serves as a “refresh button” (i.e., like that found on a computer)--clearing the mind of obsessions, compulsive urges, and extraneous thoughts. The major extracts of the Cannabis sativa plant are primarily delta9-THC (causing intoxication, psychosis, often anxiety) and secondarily the non-psychotomimetic compound Cannabidiol (CBD). Studies have found multiple therapeutic actions in the uses of CBD—with anxiolytic activities (i.e., opposing the anxiogenic actions of delta9-THC), anti-psychotic activities, and lessening of the compulsions that occur with OCD and other psychiatric conditions.

      "title": "Design of an Assistive Device for Older Age People Suffering from Essential Tremor",
      "abstract": "Essential tremor (ET) is a nerve disorder characterized by uncontrollable shaking, or tremors, in different parts and on different sides of the body. Areas affected often include the hands, arms, head, larynx (voice box), tongue, and chin. The lower body is rarely affected. ET is not a life-threatening disorder, unless it prevents a person from caring for him or herself. Essential tremor is characterised by rhythmic shaking that occurs during voluntary movement or while holding a position against gravity. The two types of tremor include: Action tremor – a voluntary movement such as lifting a cup to one's mouth and Postural tremor – a voluntary holding of a position against gravity such as reaching or extending one's hand or arm. Most people with essential tremor experience both postural and action tremor. Most people are able to live normal lives with this condition -- although they may find everyday activities like eating, dressing, or writing difficult. It is only when the tremors become severe that they actually cause disability. So, the aim of this project is to design an assistive device for older age people suffering from essential disorder which can be able to nullify the tremor produced in the hand with maximum percentage of efficiency and ergonomically designed for easy use. The main objective of the project is focusing on the design of an intelligent device that can recognize the tremor automatically by differentiating the frequency at normal stage and at the shaking stage in order to accomplish the neutralizing effect in the shortest possible time",

Closely related derivatives of asphyxiophilic sex are anesthesiophilia (inhalation of variable volatile substances) and electrophilia (use of electric current during sexual activity)--both also intended to enhance the sexual stimulation.

The conditions now prevailing in the educational institutions (mass schooling without any individual orientation before the end of college) oblige the teenager to submit to teaching methods and to the school system. School can reveal the subject's personal problems (anxiety, phobia or depression), but may equally create pathology by not recognising the heterogeneity of individual development and differences in cognitive functioning. In adolescence, the ego is particularly vulnerable. Anything that may induce its instability can create behavioural problems (instability, aggressiveness, inhibition) or problems of thought (anxiety links, difficulties in abstraction). In order to cope with such a haemorrhage of the ego, the adolescent may have recourse to certain behaviours (e.g. use of drugs leading to dependence). So it is important the know well the links between school failure and behavioural problems or drug consumption because, in one way or another, by their sanction or by lack of motivation, these situations will lead very quickly to school disengagement, which in turn leads to the breakdown of the ego.",

      "abstract": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is one of the major anxiety disorders in the fourth edition of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV: American Psychiatric Association, 1994). The disorder is characterized by persistent obsessions and compulsions that are time-consuming or cause marked distress or impairment and are perceived by the patient to be excessive or unreasonable. Obsessions are intrusive, recurrent, and persistent thoughts, images, or impulses that are unacceptable, unwanted, and usually associated with subjective resistance (Rachman and Hodgson, 1980). The content of the obsession is egodystonic in that it deals with themes that are inconsistent or even alien to one's sense of self, values, or usual ways of behaving (Purdon and Clark, 1999). Because of this the occurrence of the obsession is highly distressing for individuals with OCD, even though they may acknowledge that the intrusion is senseless and irrational (Rachman and Hodgson, 1980). The most commonobsessions involve concerns about dirt/disease contamination, accidents, unintended aggression or violence towards others, inappropriate sexual acts, mistakes, doubt, blasphemous thoughts, orderliness and symmetry, and hoarding.",

Concepts of health and illness are influenced by, among other things, physical, psychological, and social processes, and are dynamic and subject to change. Mental health problems arise from diverse sets of circumstances and from widely varying contexts. Often a problem can be detected through changes in a child’s emotional state (increasing anxiety or distress) or through changes in behaviour towards other people or property. Features of a problem that facilitate the assessment and understanding of what is happening include the intensity and seriousness of the problem, its frequency of occurrence, its duration over time, and its effects on the child and those close to the child. When mental health problems become severe, persistent, or associated with other problems, they may be referred to as a ‘disorder’. A mental disorder is, therefore, a mental health problem that has become severe or persistent, and seriously disrupts normal functioning.",

      "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a complex clinical phenomenon. (Raji) The classic designations of mild, moderate, or severe TBI are based on the acute clinical presentation and do not necessarily predict the long-term outcome. The long held assumption that the mild forms of this condition recover rapidly and without consequence is not supported by more recent literature. The effects of several mechanisms for TBI lead to neurophysiological changes, cellular depolarization, and apoptosis that occur on a continuum and can progress over a protracted period of time. Mild TBI (mTBI), particularly repetitive mild TBI, can create neuropathology that contributes to long-term increases in morbidity and mortality. People with TBI have an increased risk of death by suicide (3-4 times greater), higher suicide attempts and suicide ideation. (Simpson) Repetitive mild TBI, also known as ‘‘repetitive concussion,’’ can lead to a progressive deposition of tau protein in neural tissues (tauopathy), now known as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). At this point this is an irreversible and deadly condition.\r\nThe diagnosis of TBI, particularly mild TBI (mTBI), remains a challenge clinically. There is overlap between the symptoms of mild TBI and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Symptoms can include headache, dizziness, irritability, sleep disturbances, sensitivity to light and noise, impulsivity, judgment problems, visual disturbances, emotional outbursts, depression, and anxiety. \r\nImaging using MRI, neuroimaging, is one focus to identify changes in brain function. Changes in brain structure are a late change in most neurological disorders, such as dementia. Structural changes able to be seen on MRI are frequently insensitive to the earliest changes seen in disease progression. \r\nIn TBI, a recent study showed that changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) preceded changes in MRI diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). CBF abnormalities persist even in chronic TBI. Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography (SPECT) can identify early changes in neurological diseases through regional CBF. This may be predictive of damage. But, SPECT is not widely available, expensive and not covered by insurance.\r\nIt’s actually likely, given the limitations of every technology, that multiple approaches are necessary to produce a complete picture.",

      "title": "Womb, gravity, and space: shifting towards the cerebellum-basal ganglia paradigm in dystonia",
      "abstract": "Do we all experience a phase of dystonia in our lives? Surprisingly, yes. Based on the current classification, dystonia is defined as \"a movement disorder characterized by sustained or intermittent muscle contractions causing abnormal, often repetitive, movements, postures, or both\" (1,2). Based on this definition, it appears that we all pass through a physiological dystonia phase, at least early in life (3). Indeed, movements typically considered dystonic (abnormal) in pediatric and adult stages (1,4) are not phenotypically dissimilar from those observed in healthy neonates and infants (5,6). For example, newborns and infants display involuntary paroxysmal behaviors -movements that are non-epileptic and arise from normal developmental trajectories and exploratory motor skills (e.g., arm rotations, oral-buccal-lingual movements, biking, and pacing) (7)(8)(9)(10). Standard electroencephalographic (EEG) or video-EEG recordings performed during these neonatal movements generally do not indicate seizure activity or other encephalopathic conditions (11)(12)(13).Interestingly, even before birth, fetuses display dystonia-like stereotyped movements (14).These movements occur in a unique environment, with the fetus fully immersed in a microgravitylike amniotic fluid environment (15). Throughout gestation, fetal movements interact with increasing gravitational forces, a result of fetal growth and the gradual reduction of amniotic fluid volume (16)(17)(18). Remarkably, these motor, neuromuscular, and brain developmental processes are finely regulated by specific genetic, molecular, and physiological mechanisms, many of which have only recently begun to be understood in terms of timing and their developmental (ontogenic) and evolutionary (phylogenic) roles (19)(20)(21)(22).At another end of life experiences, humans (and some animals) may spend time in space, either for occupational or recreational purposes (23). In these conditions -ranging from hours to months -subjects encounter changes and adaptations in motor and non-motor functions due to weightlessness, or microgravity, which is a state of near or complete absence of the sensation of weight. Life on Earth, and animal life in general, has evolved to adapt motor and non-motor behaviors in response to gravity (24,25). Through various sensory and motor adaptations, humans and land animals maintain postural equilibrium, coordinating agonist-antagonist muscle processing to survive (26). This coordination involves complex integration of visual, vestibular, and somatosensory inputs to counteract gravity's effects (27).Neuroanatomically, the cerebellum (CRB) is a central hub for gravity response and adaptation, primarily due to its direct connections with both ocular-and gravity-sensing vestibular receptors (28). The CRB is integral to spatial orientation and gait regulation via the spinocerebellum and ponto-cerebellum systems, which are essential for motor control, coordination, and learning, making it the main center for anti-gravity processes (29)(30)(31)(32). Both on Earth and in space, dystonic movements disrupt gravity perception, affecting posture, gait, and fine motor coordination (33). In space, where gravitational forces are reduced, the vestibulocerebellar system rapidly adapts, recalibrating its responses to accommodate the altered gravitational environment (34). This adaptation occurs almost instantly, similar to the adjustment newborns make at birth when transitioning from microgravity in the womb to Earth's full gravity (35,36).Understanding cerebellar responses to altered gravity in both space and prenatal environments could deepen insights into gravity-related consequences for astronauts, fetuses, infants, and patients with dystonia (37). Gravity shifts, such as weightlessness, trigger neuromuscular, sensory, and vestibular changes that may contribute to distinct syndromic features, particularly in astronauts (38,39). Among these phenomena, dystonia-like movements stand out (40)(41)(42). Notably, though similar dystonia-like movements appear in healthy individuals on Earth (pre-and post-birth), in microgravity, and in patients with dystonia, the underlying causes may differ. However, phenotypic, pathogenetic and adaptive similarities and differences across different dystonia-appearing phenomena could still provide meaningful and possibly unexpected tools for the treatment of dystonia in general or specific forms of it (43). For example, it is expected that hypergravity environments exacerbate symptoms or lead to different manifestations of muscle control challenges. Increased gravitational forces may amplify muscle rigidity or spasms in those with dystonia. On the other hand, for individuals with dystonia, exposure to microgravity (like fetuses) could have therapeutic effects. More specifically, microgravity environments tend to decrease overall muscle tone and reduce physical resistance and consequently, people with dystonia could ease some symptoms related to muscle contractions and spasms. Moreover, microgravity may offer temporary relief from the continuous muscle firing and rigidity that characterizes dystonia. In addition, microgravity could set changes in neurocircuits feedback loops, and specifically in the BG-CRB inputs since it alters proprioception and how the brain interprets muscle feedback and so potentially modifying movement patterns. We hypothesize that the same adaptive phenomena are actually present in the opposite direction at the passage from inutero (microgravity) to extra-utero (at birth). A better understanding of the genetic or metabolic causes and processes of these BG-CRB mechanisms at birth could actually provide new rehabilitative approaches for dystonia patients in general or for those type of dystonia (isolated dystonia) that appear physiopathological closer to the neonatal events. Importantly, this hypothesis, while still speculative, seems to be supported by studies using animals in a microgravitational environment during and after pregnancy (44,45). Furthermore, microgravity leads to muscle atrophy over time, and without gravity as resistance, muscles lose strength. For someone with dystonia, muscle weakening might temporarily lessen spastic contractions but could also lead to long-term challenges in muscle control. In general, microgravity effects exploration has expanded our understanding of neurological conditions by showing how the absence of gravity affects motor control and muscle function (46,47). This knowledge might inform treatments that mimic the effects of microgravity to help manage dystonia symptoms on Earth, such as specialized anti-gravity rehabilitation apparatuses.In general, we propose that motor phenomena in space and the womb may be more accurately linked to cerebellar mechanisms rather than primarily to basal ganglia (BG) dysfunction, as seen in many dystonia cases (48,49). In particular, cerebellar injury in utero have been recently the focus of various studies that have applied non-invasive imaging techniques (i.e. MRI, ultrasound) to analyze in more detail, especially in neuroanatomical terms, cerebellar lesions in utero and their clinical consequences during gestation and after birth (50). Cerebellar injury in utero are associated to both motor and non-motor consequences and among the motor abnormalities alterations of fine motor skills have been described and some of them have dystonialike features. Moreover, the biological and neurophysiological aspects of the synchronization between vestibular system development and microgravity-to-gravity passage started to offer more specific notions about the possibility of cerebellar injury and their consequence on the motor and vestibular system (51). Furthermore, study of hypergravity (in animals) have shown that hypergravity exposure during different period of gestation deeply alter cerebellar development and Purkinje cells in particular (52,53). Purkinje cells have been shown to be affected by subtle changes in dystonia human cases (54,55) and specific genes have been involved in paroxysmal dystonia episodes in mice (56). Moreover, a study by Dooley JC (57) described, in an animal model, how the brain develops internal models for tracking limb movements in real-time, even without visual cues, to avoid delays from sensory feedback. These investigators found that, in rats, these cerebellum-dependent internal models begin forming by postnatal day 20 (P20), allowing the brain to predict and mirror movements rather than reacting to them after the fact. In particular, observing neural activity during spontaneous limb twitches in sleep, the study showed that only by P20 did a specific part of the thalamus (the ventral lateral nucleus, receiving cerebellar input) synchronize precisely with limb movement. These findings suggest that sleep twitches help develop and refine these internal movement models. These findings, if confirmed in newborns or in-utero babies, would support our hypothesis for which cerebellar-dependent internal movement modules could be associated to normal dystonic-like movement during normal development or if affected by different types of injury could be actually related to prolonged dystonic-like movements early in life and later.The overlapping yet distinct causes of these motor phenomena, despite genetic or environmental differences, could illuminate previously unexplored brain mechanisms involved in dystonia and dystonia-like movements across various life stages. A valuable approach would be to examine these movements for neuroanatomical, neurophysiological, and neurotransmitter-based similarities and differences, from fetal life to life in space (see Fig. 1). To test this hypothesis one of the possible analysis would be to systematically record (video-ultrasound) and score in-utero vs. extra-utero \"dystonia-like\" movements as related to specific cerebellar injury (vascular, developmental, metabolic). In addition, this set of data should be related to the specific timing and development of the vestibular system. These types of correlations if conformed to be associated to an increase incidence of dystonia-like phenomena during the first month of life and later, could be an excellent clinicometrics tool to assess and mitigate the long-term effect of the cerebellarvestibular dysfunction manifesting as a dystonic disorder. Moreover, a similar approach could be used to study the long-terms effects of microgravity in astronauts exposed for a long period of time to a weightlessness environment and mitigate the serious effects described after a \"quick\" hypergravity change when back on Earth (58)(59)(60) Clinically, the CRB's role in dystonia has often been overlooked in favor of BG involvement. However, recent debates have increasingly recognized the CRB's influence, challenging the idea that dystonia is solely a BG-driven condition (61)(62)(63). Evidence now suggests that both BG and CRB, along with their associated neurocircuits and neurotransmitters, are central to dystonia's pathogenesis (64). Rather than one region exclusively dominating, the involvement of BG vs. CRB appears to vary dynamically. Depending on the dystonic disorder's type, timing, and the specific genetic, developmental, and environmental conditions present, either BG or CRB dysfunction may predominate, a phenomenon that could be termed \"dynamic BG-CRB shifting\".One of the most transformative breakthroughs in the cerebellum (CRB) and basal ganglia (BG) debate has been the recent discovery of direct disynaptic connections between the CRB and BG in non-human primates -a finding that is likely applicable to humans as well (65). For decades, it was widely believed that the CRB and BG operated in isolation, with no direct connectivity.This assumption led researchers to attribute many \"cerebellar\" phenomena, such as the resting tremor seen in Parkinson's disease (PD), exclusively to BG dysfunction. The recent neuroanatomical discovery of these connections has prompted a reevaluation of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying various movement disorders, including PD and dystonia.The disynaptic connection between the CRB and BG -mediated through the thalamusholds significant physiological and pathophysiological implications. Through this pathway, the CRB sends signals to the BG, which influence both motor planning and execution. This connection may help to synchronize the CRB's role in movement coordination with the BG's role in movement initiation and control. Furthermore, the CRB influences the subthalamic nucleus, a central structure within the BG. This connection enables the CRB to indirectly modulate BG circuits involved in movement control, including those that are altered in dystonia.Adding to this complexity, the CRB appears to have a notable role in dopaminergic modulation, which is increasingly recognized as a key factor in movement disorders. Research suggests that the dopaminergic system within the cerebellum may also regulate vestibular circuits, adding another layer of influence on balance and motor stability (66). Although further research is needed to determine how these dopaminergic pathways specifically relate to dystonic symptoms, this new understanding of the CRB's neuroanatomy and neurochemical connections is already reshaping our understanding of motor abnormalities. These findings underscore the need for a paradigm shift in the study and treatment of primary dystonia. No longer can we view dystonia solely through a BG-centered lens; rather, we must adopt a dynamic BG-CRB model that recognizes the interplay between these two regions (67). This broader perspective opens new avenues for understanding and addressing dystonia's complex symptomatology.Recent advancements in neuroimaging have spurred interest in white matter (WM) alterations as a critical factor in dystonia research. Subtle but pathophysiologically significant WM changes have been documented across various forms of dystonia, underscoring the potential role of WM integrity in motor dysfunction (68)(69)(70)(71)(72). Intriguingly, MRI scans of astronauts returning from extended space missions also reveal unique WM changes, likely due to the effects of prolonged weightlessness on motor control (73)(74)(75). These findings highlight the adaptability of the cerebellum-basal ganglia (CRB-BG) circuit and suggest that neuroplasticity -especially involving WM changes -may play a significant role in dystonia's development and manifestations. Indeed, WM changes have been observed in dystonia patients and even in response to targeted peripheral treatments, such as botulinum toxin injections for cervical dystonia (76).Emerging research increasingly implicates cerebellar WM in dystonia, suggesting a largerthan-expected role for the cerebellum in this disorder. WM in the cerebellum comprises myelinated axons that connect it to the basal ganglia, motor cortex, and brainstem, facilitating complex motor coordination and communication. Alterations within these WM pathways -whether structural or metabolic -could be critical to the abnormal muscle contractions and motor control issues typical of dystonia. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), which assesses WM microstructure, has identified altered WM integrity in dystonia patients, particularly affecting pathways like the cerebellothalamo-cortical circuit, which links the cerebellum to the thalamus and cortex. Disruptions in this pathway impair the cerebellum's ability to relay precise timing and coordination signals, contributing to the disordered motor output characteristic of dystonia.Further, WM disruptions within the CRB-BG circuit affect connectivity between the cerebellum and basal ganglia, skewing the balance between motor initiation (a BG function) and motor coordination (a CRB function). This imbalance may contribute to dystonia's hallmark symptoms: disorganized movement timing, abnormal muscle contractions, and postural irregularities. Additionally, the cerebellum's involvement extends beyond mere coordination to encompass sensorimotor integration, which is essential for refining movement through sensory feedback. WM alterations interfere with this sensory processing, leading to proprioceptive challenges and decreased movement accuracy -effects that closely resemble those reported by astronauts and likely mirror the sensory experiences of neonates during the first days of life outside the womb. In fact, imaging studies in neonates, including preterm infants, reveal that WM integrity is closely linked to motor development and could predict dystonia-like motor abnormalities (77)(78).These findings underscore the importance of WM integrity within the BG-CRB framework, validating WM as a key factor in both typical and pathological motor processes. By focusing on WM changes within this framework, we may open new avenues for personalized treatments in dystonia and improve our understanding of motor adaptation under unique physiological conditions.This opinion article explores dystonia and dystonia-like disorders through the lens of recent pathophysiological findings in both dystonia patients and individuals in unique environmentssuch as the womb and space. We advocate for a new Cerebellum-Basal Ganglia (CRB-BG) paradigm to advance our understanding of dystonic phenomena. This approach is poised to benefit from emerging technologies and methodologies, including advanced neuroimaging, omics, telemedicine, neuroanatomy, and neuropathology, in both human and animal models.We propose examining this CRB-BG paradigm across three distinct environments: the womb, Earth, and space. This \"environmental triad\" offers a comprehensive framework for studying dystonic phenomena within physiological states (e.g., the floating fetus), pathological states (e.g., generalized dystonia), and paraphysiological states (e.g., human beings in microgravity). By exploring these varied environments, we aim to improve personalized treatment",

      "abstract": "Visceral pain is a common clinical condition that may be induced by stimuli such as mechanical stretching, spasm, ischemia, and inflammation. Compared with somatic pain, the mechanisms of generation, maintenance, and regulation of visceral pain are more complex, and therefore it is one of the key points and difficulties in the field of basic pain research at present. Visceral pain exhibits the following clinical characteristics: (1) vague location; (2) often accompanied by referred pain; (3) usually with reflex behaviors such as muscle contraction; (4) not exclusively caused by injury to internal organs; (5) insensitive to distending and pulling stimuli; (6) slow onset and lasting for a long time, that is, chronic pain with progressive intensification, but sometimes rapidly progressing to severe pain; and (7) particularly prone to ignite unpleasant emotions and accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and cardiovascular and respiratory changes.",

TBI is often considered separately to other acquired brain injuries due to differences in its presentation and how treatment is approached. TBI occurs over an extremely broad range of severities, from concussion through to profound and life-threatening damage. As the injury becomes more severe, the affected individual has an increasing risk of experiencing lifelong and complex physical, behavioural, emotional, cognitive and social problems. This chapter describes mechanisms, severity, consequences, related conditions, and stages of rehabilitation.",

O quadro clinico da Paralisia Cerebral e baseado no disturbio motor gerado, que pode ser classificado a partir da extensao ou distribuicao do disturbio; pela intensidade; ou pela qualidade do tonus. A extensao da lesao e caracterizada como quadriplegia, hemiplegia, diplegia ou monoplegia; a  intensidade pode ser leve, moderada, ou grave; a  qualidade do tonus  pode ser definida como espasticidade, discinesia (coreo-atetosico e distonico), rigidez, ataxia, hipotonicidade, ou mista (soma de dois tipos de tonus diferentes) (1,2,3) . Esse trabalho tem o objetivo de fornecer informacoes sobre a Paralisia Cerebral do tipo Atetosica, com a proposta de demonstrar, atraves da evolucao da paciente, como se da a abordagem fisioterapeutica durante o tratamento do paciente com essa patologia. Foi realizado um relato de caso baseado no tratamento de uma paciente do Centro de Educacao e Saude Ninota Garcia, pertencente ao grupo de criancas atendidos por alunos da disciplina de Fisioterapia na Saude da Crianca. O tratamento da paciente foi direcionado pelos  resultados encontrados em sua avalicao. Para escolha das tecnicas a serem aplicadas foi realizada uma revisao da literatura a partir da busca de estudos  que  avaliassem tecnicas de tratamento de Paralisia Cerebral do tipo Atetosica,  usando como descritores os termos  ?Athetosis? e  ?Physical Therapy? , nas bases de dados  SciELO, LILACS, PubMed,  no periodo de  2005 a 2014, alem de pesquisa realizada na Biblioteca Central Jacinto Uchoa de Mendonca usando como  descritores os termos  ?Paralisia Cerebral?, ?Fisioterapia Pediatrica?. Apos 17 sessoes de fisioterapia a evolucao da paciente trouxe resultados gratificantes, pois apesar de um prognostico  complexo, as expectativas do tratamento foram alcancadas, principalmente no que diz respeito a manutencao automatica de uma posicao desejada ou movimento contra a gravidade, onde ela consegue agora passar mais tempo sustentando a cabeca quando tenta acompanhar um objeto com o olhar, e segura por mais tempo o tronco quando posta na posicao sentada.

      "abstract": "Many peripheral neuropathies are caused by the (acute or chronic) toxic action of metals, solvents, pesticides, and other occupational and environmental contaminants. These agents often reproduce the anatomoclinical pictures of hereditary (e.g., Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease), autoimmune (Guillain-Barrè syndrome), or dysmetabolic (thiamine deficiency, diabetic neuropathy) forms. Toxic peripheral neuropathies can be classified on the basis of etiology, clinical features (sensitive, motor, sensitive-motor), or histopathology: neuronopathies (uncommon, mostly secondary to retrograde axonal degeneration; e.g., arsenic, thallium), axonopathies (acrylamide, esacarbons, CS2, organophosphate-induced delayed neuropathy), myelinopathies (trichloroethylene), mixed forms (axonal and demyelinating: lead). For many substances, experimental research has led to the identification of the molecular and cellular targets of neurotoxicity. Several compounds are active by biotransformation (e.g., the esacarbons n-hexane and MnBK are neurotoxic since they are metabolized to 2,5-hexanedione), Genetic, physiological and environmental factors determine the individual metabolic set-up, and they may give origin to differences in the workers' sensitivity. Cessation of exposure is often followed by (microscopically observable) regenerative phenomena and clinical improvement. The morphology of neuropathies can be studied through peripheral nerve biopsy. Samples of sural nerve (or other nervous trunks of the limbs), adequately fixed, sectioned, and stained, allow the observation of alterations in axonal fibres (e.g., giant-axonal neuropathy, dying back neuropathy), myelin (demyelination), Schwann cells, interstitium, and blood vessels; possible inflammatory infiltrates; fibre density; regenerative phenomena (growth cone, remyelination). In occupational medicine, biopsy is indicated when the anamnestic-clinical picture, laboratory tests, and instrumental exams leave doubts about the nature, type, and entity of the neurological damage. In such cases, current optical and electron microscopy techniques can be very useful for injury evaluation, prognosis, and follow-up.",

Dystonic movements are typically patterned, associated with twisting of body parts, and may have tremulousness. Dystonia is usually initiated or worsened by voluntary action and associated with overflow muscle activation. Cervical dystonia (CD) is the most prevalent form of dystonia. CD is a condition characterized by cranial muscle overactivity leading to abnormal intermittent or continuous posturing of the head. Non-motor symptoms are comorbidity of dystonia, which significantly hampers the quality of life among these patients. The symptoms can be as a result of the dystonia itself. However, studies have highlighted the involvement of cortical-striatal-thalamocortical circuits in primary dystonia that could be the pathophysiological basis for the non-motor symptoms. The non-motor symptoms that are commonly associated with dystonia are anxiety, depression, restless leg syndrome, excessive daytime sleepiness, cognitive disturbances, and poor sleep. This review attempts to summarize the literature on non-motor symptoms in patients with CD.",

      "title": "Explosive Rage Following Head Injury",
      "abstract": "In 1899 Kaplan described the “explosive diathesis” as follows: “Following the most trivial and impersonal causes, there is the effect of rage with its motor accompaniments. There may be the most grotesque gesticulation, excessive movements of the face, and a quick, sharp explosiveness of speech; there may be cursing and outbreaks of violence, which are often directed towards things; there may or may not be an amnesia for these afterwards. These outbursts may terminate in an epileptic fit. There is an excess in the reaction, with inadequate adaptation to the situation so remote from a well-considered purposeful act that it approaches a pure psychic reflex act in the shape of an almost or entirely unmodified explosion not unlike a convulsion. The explosive diathesis is not characteristic of head injuries, but is also found in hereditary degeneration, in alcoholic degeneration, etc.”",

      "abstract": "Motor neglect is characterized by underutilization of one side of the body when this failure cannot be attributed to primary sensory and motor defects. Impaired motor activity manifests itself in disturbance of using spontaneously contralesional limbs in the absence of severe hemiplegia (motor neglect) or in reduced readiness to initiate and carry out intact ipsilesional arm movements within or towards the contralesional hemispace (pre-motor neglect). These specific higher-order motor deficits may occur in isolation (pure motor neglect) or as part of a more pervasive neglect syndrome involving disturbances in visual, auditory, and tactile modalities or even in mental images. The lesions underlying the motor variant of hemi-neglect are ascribed to various topographic sites of the brain involving cortical and subcortical structures of the right or, rarely, the left hemisphere. Motor features of neglect are more frequent, more severe and long-lasting in right--as compared with left--brain-damaged patients. This deficit additionally makes improvement and neurorehabilitation of patients with focal brain damage difficult.",

      "title": "Deep brain stimulation for dystonia",
      "abstract": "The term 'dystonia' refers to a clinical syndrome of involuntary and repetitive muscle contractions leading to abnormal movements and body postures. The most common classification of dystonia is based on the three axes: etiology; age of disease onset; and distribution of affected body regions. The etiology of dystonia may be primary or secondary to an acquired cause (e.g., a hypoxic brain injury). Secondary dystonias are typically not 'pure' dystonias, but are accompanied by other neurological signs and symptoms. Exceptions are acute dystonic reactions or tardive dystonia (TD) caused by the acute or chronic use of antidopaminergic drugs, which are pure and clinically indistinguishable from primary dystonias. Primary dystonias may be accompanied by Parkinsonism or myoclonus only and are termed 'dystonia plus' syndromes in these cases. A genetic cause has been identified in an increasing number of primary dystonias or dystonia-plus syndromes. These monogenic forms are referred to as DYT1 to DYT20 (for a review see [1]). The severity and distribution of dystonia is linked to age with a greater tendency to develop generalized dystonia with an early onset (below 26 years of age) versus a late onset (>26 years of age). The distribution of dystonia can be described as focal (only a single body region affected), segmental (two adjacent body parts affected), multifocal (several noncontiguous parts affected), generalized or hemidystonia (one body half affected). The three diagnostic axes help to characterize clinically distinct forms of dystonia with a particular cause and prognosis; for example, early onset primary focal dystonia tends to generalize rapidly, can lead to severe physical disability and is often monogenic (e.g., DYT1 or DYT6), whereas the more prevalent adult-onset focal dystonias show little progression and are mostly sporadic.",

      "abstract": "Stressful life experience can have significant effects on a variety of physiological systems, including the autonomic nervous system, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, and the immune system. These relationships can be bidirectional; for example, immune cell products can act on the brain, altering mood and cognition, potentially contributing to depression. Although acute physiological alterations may be adaptive in the short term, chronic or repeated provocation can result in damage to health. The central dogma in the field of stress research assumes a stereotyped physiological response to all stressors (the generality model). However, increasing evidence suggests that specific stressful conditions and the specific way an organism appraises these conditions can elicit qualitatively distinct emotional and physiological responses (the integrated specificity model). For example, appraisals of threat (vs. challenge), uncontrollability, and negative social evaluation have been shown to provoke specific psychobiological responses. Emotional responses appear to have specific neural substrates, which can result in differentiated alterations in peripheral physiological systems, so that it is incorrect to presume a uniform stress response.",

      "abstract": "Dystonia is a movement disorder characterized by abnormal, involuntary, and excessive co-contractions of agonist and antagonist muscles. It can affect one or several parts of the body and manifest itself as twisting movements, tremors or abnormal postures (1). When focal, it can affect the upper limb, the eye or the neck, resulting in writer’s cramp, blepharospasm and cervical dystonia, respectively.\nDystonia can be classified based on its clinical features or its underlying causes (2). A distinction is often made between two clinical phenotypes: an organic form of cervical dystonia (CD) and a functional form of it (f-CD) – also called psychogenic. The term organic refers to various entities where a neurological substrate is suspected or demonstrated to explain the physiopathology. By extension, it refers sometimes to idiopathic dystonia with typical clinical presentation. The term organic is mainly used in opposition to psychiatric entities such as psychogenic dystonia that is considered to be a functional movement disorder (FMD). Nowadays, both are regarded as clinical forms with different positive signs and diagnosis (2–4). Nonetheless, because of partly overlapping features, the distinction varies between experts giving the diagnosis (5,6); making the distinction between the two diagnoses a key challenge.\nDiagnosis of functional dystonia is mainly based on clinical criteria (3,4). However, a clinical study showed that about 37 of 87 idiopathic cervical dystonia patients were initially misdiagnosed as psychogenic (7). According to Dauer et al., (1998) “The only way to make the diagnosis with relative certainty is by finding persistent disappearance of the movements with psychiatric therapy” – when speaking about functional dystonia (8). Furthermore, the misdiagnosed patients receive the same chronical palliative treatment as the other dystonic patients yet without long-lasting improvement.\nMore in line with present nomenclature, our study includes idiopathic, adult-onset, focal, isolated cervical dystonia (CD) and functional cervical dystonia (f-CD). However, for the sake of simplicity, we will be referring to them as organic (CD) and functional (f-CD).",

      "abstract": "Exposure to overwhelming stress often determines how people subsequently organize their perceptions of themselves and of others. Traumatic experiences at different developmental levels have different effects on cognitive, affective and biological self-organization. Acute or chronic exposure to trauma may be expressed as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), dissociative disorders, somatic disturbances and alterations in perception of self and others. These disorders involve (a) the involuntary repetitive re-living of the trauma in thoughts, images, somatic states or behaviors, (b) attempts to avoid dealing with reminders of the past, (c) problems with the modulation of physiological responses to subsequent stress, and (d) a loss of capacity to engage in love and work with pleasure and satisfaction. The display of extremes of emotional distress, or of bizarre or disorganized behaviors, easily obscures the fact that current problems may have their origins in past trauma. The recognition that many psychiatric patients organize much of their lives around repetitive patterns of re-living and warding off traumatic memories, reminders and affective states, may help clinicians understand their symptoms as misguided attempts to regain a sense of control and safety, rather than as bizarre behaviors that need to be merely controlled. Since safe attachments appear to be the primary way in which children learn to regulate internal state changes, the negotiation of interpersonal safety needs to be the first focus of treatment. Since the labeling and categorization of emotional states is one of the principal areas of functioning that is disrupted by developmental trauma, treatment needs to include learning how to use words to understand and interpret feelings in general and stressful events, in particular. Since distrust and lack of social safety are critical parts of developmental trauma, structure and predictability are essential. Identifying specific trauma-based perceptions and expectations and learning how to negotiate the fulfillment of one's emotional needs are critical aspects of effective treatment.",

Thus a specific role for neurochemical or neuroendocrine factors certainly cannot be postulated or elucidated to explain such behavior in its entirety. Even when the term “antisocial” is used in other than a legal or criminological sense – for example, when it is applied in psychiatric diagnostics in an attempt to define and understand individual human behavior more fully – it remains overinclusive. From a clinical standpoint, the term “antisocial” most often signifies antisocial personality disorder (American Psychiatric Association, 1952, 1968, 1980), which in the third edition of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III) is considered an “axis II” personality disorder, which may or may not coexist with certain “axis I” clinical syndromes or other conditions. Simply stated, this means that, according to current diagnostic nomenclature, an antisocial personality disorder theoretically could coexist with an organic mental disorder, substance use disorder, paranoid disorder, depressive disorder, psychosexual disorder, and so on.",

The pathological manifestations of cerebral damage are usually believed to be of two general types—first, those symptoms which result directly from the loss of or damage to cerebral tissue, and, second, symptoms not directly associated with tissue loss, but, rather, symptoms of indirect or \"superimposed\" psychological disturbances, e.g., the patient's reactions to or attitudes toward disability occasioned by brain damage. Evidence of cerebral dysfunction may show up in one or more areas, such as sensory or motor function, intellectual functioning, emotional control, manifestation of seizure phenomena, and others. In medicine, the classical picture of the brain-injured child has traditionally included some motor defect as a primary condition. Beginning",

      "title": "Concussion in Sport",
      "abstract": "Concussions affect millions of athletes of all ages each year in a variety of sports. Athletes in certain sports such as American football, ice hockey, rugby, soccer, and combative sports like boxing are at higher risk for concussion. Direct or indirect mechanical forces acting on the skull and brain cause a concussion, which is a milder form of brain injury. Conventional neuroimaging (e.g., computerized tomography [CT], magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) for concussion is typically negative. Concussions involve both neurometabolic and subtle structural damage to the brain that results in signs (e.g., loss of consciousness [LOC], amnesia, confusion), symptoms (e.g., headache, dizziness, nausea), and functional impairment (e.g., cognitive, balance, vestibular, oculomotor). Symptoms, impairment, and recovery time following concussion can last from a few days to weeks or months, based on a variety of risk factors, including younger age, female sex, history of concussion, and history of migraine. Following a concussion, athletes may experience one or more clinical profiles, including cognitive fatigue, vestibular, oculomotor, post-traumatic migraine (PTM), mood/anxiety, and/or cervical. The heterogeneous nature of concussion warrants a comprehensive approach to assessment, including a thorough clinical examination and interview; symptom inventories; and cognitive, balance, vestibular, oculomotor, and exertion-based evaluations. Targeted treatment and rehabilitation strategies including behavior management, vestibular, vision, and exertion therapies, and in some cases medication can be effective in treating the various concussion clinical profiles. Some athletes experience persistent post-concussion symptoms (PCS) and/or psychological issues (e.g., depression, anxiety) following concussion. Following appropriate treatment and rehabilitation strategies, determination of safe return to play is predicated on being symptom-free and back to normal levels of function at rest and following exertion. Certain populations, including youth athletes, may be at a higher risk for worse impairment and prolonged recovery following concussion. It has been suggested that some athletes experience long-term effects associated with concussion including chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). However, additional empirical studies on the role of concussion on CTE are needed, as CTE may have multiple causes that are unrelated to sport participation and concussion.",

Stiff-man syndromeThis syndrome is of insidious onset, usually in the 4th and 5th decades and affects men and women equally. 1-5Tightness and stiffness of the trunk are early symptoms and are due to continuous contraction of lumbar and abdominal muscles.Axial rigidity progresses slowly over months or years.Abdominal wall rigidity (\"board-like\") and contraction of thoracolumbar paraspinal muscles produce a characteristic hyperlordosis of the lumbar spine which persists at rest.So typical of the condition is this posture that the diagnosis should be questioned without it.3Voluntary movements of the trunk and legs become slow, awkward and restricted.Proximal limb muscles become involved later, but face and distal limbs are generally spared.Muscle spasms, superimposed on the muscle rigidity, are common early complaints; spasms are precipitated by voluntary movement, fright or sound and may be painful and severe.Physiological mechanisms for the spasms include exaggerated, non-habituating exter- oceptive or cutaneomuscular reflexes,6 brainstem myo- clonus8 and exaggeration of the startle reflex.9\" The term \"jerking stiff-man\" syndrome refers to prominence of the latter in some cases.8Sphincter function is normal.The remainder of the neurological examination, including cognition, cranial nerves, muscle strength, tendon reflexes, sensation and coordination is normal.Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus is present in one to two thirds of patients.24Autoimmune thyroid disease, pernicious anaemia and vitiligo are also common.Epilepsy in the stiff-man syndrome occurs in about 10%.4 l Electromyography of affected muscles reveals con- tinuous motor unit activity, despite attempted relaxation, comprising motor units of normal morphology.Peripheral nerve conduction is normal.A central origin for the spasms, rigidity and continuous motor unit activity is suggested by their disappearance during sleep and after peripheral nerve block and spinal or general anaesthesia.Abnormal excitability of spinal interneuronal networks (and their descending control) has been suggested as one cause of the stiff-man syndrome,6\" explaining the axial on August 19, 2023 by guest.",

      "abstract": "The author fundamentally questions the traditional concept of the disease-entity (or several disease entities) of 'schizophrenia' and discusses an alternative concept, based on vulnerability and information-processing. According to this, schizophrenia-like psychotic phenomena develop in three phases. In the first, premorbid phase, combined biological (genetic and possibly other organic) and psycho-social influences lead to a premorbid 'vulnerability', characterised by a low tolerance of cognitive and emotional stress, corresponding to an insufficient capacity for the adequate processing of complex information. In the second phase, stressful life-events can lead to unique or repeated acute productive psychotic episodes. The third phase, that of long-term evolution, depends more on psycho-social influences than on biological factors. Under unfavourable conditions, it may lead to predominantly unproductive residual states of various degrees, which can largely be understood as regulatory mechanisms to restrict stressful over-stimulation. There is no clearly delimitable disease entity of schizophrenia with constant causes, psychopathological picture, or course, but rather a multi-conditioned life-process, occurring in people with a particular vulnerability, interacting with complex life-events and circumstances. This new concept has important consequences for therapy and prevention.",

Traumatic events include physical or sexual abuse or maltreatment, road traffic injuries, violence, war-related trauma, severe burns, and natural disasters, among others.(1) These events are considered trauma-tic because they overwhelm a child or adolescent's perceived ability to cope. During the traumatic event, there is recruitment of adaptive, stressmediating neural systems (e.g., hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and sympathetic nervous system) that, in turn, produces adaptive physiological, behavioral, emotional, and cognitive responses necessary for survival.(2) By definition and according to the DSM-IV-TR, traumatic events should evoke acute subjective reactions of intense fear, horror, or helplessness.(1, 3)However, the DSM-IV-TR includes a qualifier for children and adolescents who may instead show responses of disorganized or agitated behavior.(3) The DSM-IV-TR requirement of a subjective response acknowledges that individual traumatic reactions play a crucial role in determining the development of PTSD.",

      "title": "Obsessive-Compulsive and Related Disorders",
      "abstract": "When evaluating a patient whose preoccupations and rituals have become persistent, excessive, and impairing, clinicians are encouraged to consider each of the disorders within the chapter on obsessive-compulsive and related disorders. These include obsessive-compulsive disorder, body dysmorphic disorder, hoarding disorder, trichotillomania (hair-pulling disorder), and excoriation (skin-picking) disorder. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by the presence of obsessions and/or compulsions. Obsessions are unwanted and repetitive thoughts that often involve such concerns as pathological doubt, fear of contamination, somatic concerns, and a need for symmetry. Compulsions are the repetitive behaviors that are performed in response to the distress of the obsessions. Common compulsive behaviors include checking, ordering, cleaning, and mental rituals. Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is characterized by a preoccupation with one or more physical flaws that are not readily apparent to others. In addition, a diagnosis of BDD requires repetitive behaviors (such as excessive grooming or reassurance seeking) and significant distress or dysfunction. If the preoccupation is primarily about weight, however, then that patient would receive an eating disorder diagnosis if diagnostic criteria for an eating disorder are met. Once a diagnosis is made, DSM-5 includes multiple specifiers for many of its diagnoses. OCD, BDD, and hoarding disorder are unusual in having an \"insight\" specifier. The insight specifier characterizes patients as having good or fair insight, poor insight, or absent insight/delusional beliefs. For example, people who are delusionally convinced that their BDD beliefs are true would not be coded as having a comorbid psychotic disorder (e.g., delusional disorder) but would instead be noted to have BDD with absent insight. Trichotillomania (hair-pulling), and excoriation (skin-picking) are the most common body-focused, repetitive behavior disorders. Hair-pulling disorder was previously listed among the impulse-control disorders not elsewhere classified, along with such disorders as pyromania and intermittent explosive disorder. Skin-picking disorder was new in DSM-5. Both disorders involve the sort of persistent, repetitive dysfunctional behaviors that characterize all of the obsessive-compulsive and related disorders. Hoarding disorder was also new in DSM-5. It was previously listed as a possible criterion for obsessive-compulsive personality disorder or considered a symptom of OCD. In some cases, hoarding-type behavior is a symptom of OCD (e.g., if trash accumulates because of fears of becoming contaminated by touching it), but evidence indicates that dysfunctional hoarding often exists without an accompanying OCD diagnosis. As continues to be true throughout much of DSM-5, this chapter includes categories for patients whose symptoms are assessed to be secondary to medications, substances, or another medical condition. DSM-5 also allows clinicians to identify clinically relevant conditions that do not meet full criteria for a disorder. For example, a presentation that meets criteria for body dysmorphic disorder in a person who has significant physical flaws—a circumstance that would preclude the use of that diagnosis (which requires that any physical flaws be no more than \"slight\")—could be recorded as \"other specified obsessive-compulsive and related disorder (body dysmorphic–like disorder with actual flaws).\" The \"other specified\" diagnosis might also be used to refer to a symptom cluster not described in the criteria for any DSM-5 obsessive-compulsive and related disorder, such as obsessional jealousy or olfactory reference disorder. \"Unspecified\" disorders can refer to symptom clusters that resemble presentations found in a particular DSM-5 chapter but that do not meet criteria for any specific disorder; the unspecified diagnosis is often used when the clinician has insufficient clinical information to make a diagnosis, such as in an emergency evaluation or an initial consultation.",

Depression is common and serious problem that often starts in childhood. Today is estimated that approximatly 10-15% of children in general population has syptoms of depression. It is associated with an increased risk of other psychiatric disorders, poor academic success, underdeveloped social skills and even suicidal thoughts. The primary symptoms of depression are continuous feelings of sadness and hopelessness and mood changes. Symptoms of depression in children also include irritability or anger, social withdrawal, changes in appetite (either increased or decreased), changes in sleep (sleeplessness or excessive sleep), difficulty concentrating, etc. Depressive disorders include Major depressive disorder, dysthymic disorder, depressive disorder, indeterminate and bipolar disorder. Depression in children can be caused by any combination of factors that relate to physical health, life events, family history, environment, genetic vulnerability and biochemical disturbance. Depression should be recognized and diagnosed as early as possible in children and adolescents in order to start treatment on time. The most efficient treatment is a treatment that is not focused on depressive symptoms only, but also on functioning on daily bases in children.",

Symptoms are also evoked in flight and car simulators where the experienced motion and the inertial motion of the body do not correspond. Motion sickness is now being reported in virtual environments, especially those involving dynamic patterns of apparent self-motion. Such environments embody sensory and inertial discordances that are for physical situations of stimulation most provocative. Motion sickness embodies a wide constellation of signs and symptoms, not just nausea and vomiting. In fact, drowsiness, eye strain, lack of initiative, and fatigue are symptoms of motion sickness commonly elicited in relatively unprovocative environments. Progress in understanding and predicting the occurrence of motion sickness has been hampered by the lack of an adequate theory. This talk will include discussion of situations that elicit motion sickness, how symptoms vary for different situations, how adaptation can be hastened, and how it is possible to have multiple adapted states for different environments.",

      "abstract": "Nyeri kepala merupakan bagian dari pengalaman manusia dalam kehidupan sehari-hari dan sering kali dikeluhkan ke dokter. Yang menjadi masalah meskipun frequensi nyeri kepala dalam praktek sehari-hari sangat tinggi, adalah kesulitan penegakan diagnosis. Seringkali ada ketidakcocokan antara derajat berat keluhan nyeri kepala dan adanya faktor penyebab struktural atau organik yang memang perlu dicemaskan. Bahkan gejala berbagai jenis nyeri kepala boleh dikatakan hampir sama dan tumpang tindih, menambah kesulitan untuk mengenal atau mendiagnosis jenis nyeri kepala, yang diperlukan untuk pegangan penentuan pengobatan. Maka pemahamam neuromuskuloskeletal kepala dan leher baik dari aspek anatomi maupun fisiologi menjadi sangat penting. \r\nNyeri kepala tegang primer ada dua jenis yaitu nyeri kepala tegang episodik dan nyeri kepala tegang khronik. Nyeri kepala tegang primer paling sedikit harus mempunyai 2 dari karakteristik berikut: 1) lokasinya dua sisi, 2) terasa seperti ditekan atau diikat sekeliling kepala (tidak berdenyut), 3) dengan intensitas ringan sampai sedang, 4) tidak bertambah berat saat aktivitas rutin seperti: berjalan atau naik tangga. Tidak dijumpai sama sekali mual dan tumpah, dapat dijumpai sekali photophobia (takut sinar) atau phonophobia (takut suara). Nyeri kepala tegang kadang-kadang meluas ke tengkuk atau sebaliknya mulai dari tengkuk meluas ke kepala \r\nPada nyeri kepala tagang, puncak kepala seperti ditekan, sekeliling kepala seperti diikat. Hal ini disebabkan karena ketegangan berlebihan otot daerah dahi, otot belakang kepala, dan otot daerah pelipis. Otot-otot lain yang mengalami ketegangan pad a nyeri kepala tegang adalah otot yang berfungsi untuk menegakkan kepala. Tarikan otot berkepanjangan pada kulit tulang di daerah perlekatan otot yaitu pada tulang belakang kepala dapat menimbulkan proses peradangan yang berakitab juga timbulnya rasa nyeri di daerah tersebut. \r\nPada keadaan biasa otot-otot leher bagian belakang sudah dalam keadaan dengan tonus atau ketegangan otot tertentu untuk mempertahankan supaya kepala tetap tegak. Stres fisik karena posisi tertentu berakibat otot menjadi lelah dan teregang peregangan ini lewat kumparan otot akan menimbulkan secara refleks ketegangan otot yang akan semakin meningkat, dan dapat menjadi khronis. Pemicu lain nyeri kepala tegang primer adalah aspek psikis yang terkait dengan stres. Stres mental atau pun stres fisik setelah diterima pusat-pusat penganalisis sensorik di otak, diproyeksikan ke sistim limbik (pusat untuk emosi). Melalui jaras-jaras tertentu diproyeksikan lagi ke hipotalamus (sistem komando) yang akan meng-ekspresikannya lewat jalur otonom maupun kelenjar hormon dan jalur motorik. Nyeri kepala tegang primer umumnya dikeluhkan bersama keluhan lain yang menunjukkan hiperaktivitas otonom. Faktor pencetus penting pada nyeri kepala tegang baik faktor fisik, ataupun psikis. Di sinilah pemahaman mengenai anatomi dan fisiologi dibutuhkan, yaitu yang terkait dengan pekerjaan atau okupasi dan aktivitas fisik harian serta keadaan emosi yang mewarnai \r\nPengobatan nyeri kepala tegang primer mengacu pada keluhan pasien, hasil pemeriksaan fisik, dan adanya faktor-faktor pencetus. Obat ditujukan untuk relaksasi otot dan anti nyeri. Manipulasi fisik dapat untuk merilekskan otot juga, yaitu dengan pemanasan dan pemijatan otot. Faktor psikis tidak boleh dilupakan untuk dicoba diatasi.",

      "title": "Neurobiological bases for impulsive and compulsive behaviour: Implications for pharmacological and psychological interventions",
      "abstract": "Pathological impulsivity and/or compulsivity charcterize a wide range of mental disorders, including impulse control disorders, obsessive-compulsive and related disorders, personality disorders, substance use disorder and behavioural addictions. Impulsivity is a complex, multidimensional personality trait which consists of at least two dimensions: disinhibition (impulsive actions) and impulsive decision-making or impulsive choice, with an underestimation of potentially dangerous consequences (e.g., aggression, pathological gambling, hypersexuality). Compulsivity refers to repetitive, ritualized behaviours that are performed according to a certain rule and in a certain manner, most often in order to reduce anxiety or discomfort. Impulsivity and compulsivity share an inability to stop or delay repetitive behaviour. Over time, impulsive behaviour can become compulsive (when it loses the excitement characteristic), and compulsive behaviour can become impulsive (enhanced by habituation). Many psychiatric disorders include elements of both compulsivity and impulsivity, showing a different predominance during the various stages of the disorder (e.g. in substance use disorder impulsivity usually dominates in the early stages of the disorder, and compulsivity in the later stages). The neurobiological basis for impulsivity and compulsivity may include excitatory neurotransmitters such as dopamine, norepinephrine and glutamate, or inhibitory neurotransmitters such as serotonin and gama-aminobuteryc acid, as well as dysfunction in the prefrontal cortex and limbic system. Increased activity of the frontal lobes can lead to compulsive disorders, and reduced activity can lead to impulse control disorders. Results of neurobiological studies suggest that there is a hereditary and/or environmentally conditioned predisposition to lower receptor availability of dopamine in the midbrain, a neurotransmitter whose imbalance is involved in behavioural disinhibition and pathological hypersensitivity to time delayed rewards, i.e. discarding the time delay for immediate reward, which is the basis for impulsive behaviour. On the other hand, compulsive behaviour is primarily associated with serotonin dysfunction, but this disregulation may indirectly affect the functioning of the dopaminergic and other neurotransmission systems. This paper presents an overview of clinical and neurobiological similarities and differences in impulsivity and compulsivity through a wide range of mental disorders, with implications for pharmacological and psychological interventions.",

      "abstract": "Abstract General movements (GMs) are part of the spontaneous movement repertoire and are present from early fetal life onwards until the end of the first half a year of life. GMs are complex, occur frequently, and last long enough to be observed properly. They involve the whole body in a variable sequence of arm, leg, neck, and trunk movements. They wax and wane in intensity, force and speed, and they have a gradual beginning and end. Rotations along the axis of the limbs and slight changes in the direction of movements make them fluent and elegant and create the impression of complexity and variability. If the nervous system is impaired, GMs loose their complex and variable character and become monotonous and poor. Two specific abnormal GM patterns reliably predict later cerebral palsy: 1) a persistent pattern of cramped‐synchronized GMs. The movements appear rigid and lack the normal smooth and fluent character. Limb and trunk muscles contract and relax almost simultaneously. 2) The absence of GMs of fidgety character. So‐called fidgety movements are small movements of moderate speed with variable acceleration of neck, trunk, and limbs in all directions. Normally, they are the predominant movement pattern in an awake infant at 3 to 5 months. Beside a sensitivity and specificity of 95% each, the assessment of GMs is quick, noninvasive, even nonintrusive, and cost‐effective compared with other techniques, e.g., magnetic resonance imaging, brain ultrasound, and traditional neurological examination. © 2005 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

      "abstract": "Combat scene, a wounded or dead hoplite lies on the ground, black-figured hydria, Cleimachos (potter), 560-550 BCE. Louvre, (Museum), Paris, France. Photo credit: Erich Lessing/Art Resource, NY. Diagnosing concussion has posed a special challenge in current military conflicts, as some symptoms and clinical findings are similar to acute stress reaction and other conditions. The Department of Defense (DoD) currently defines a traumatic brain injury (TBI) as: a traumatically induced structural injury and/or physiological disruption of brain function as a result of an external force that is indicated by new onset or worsening of at least one of the following clinical signs, immediately following the event: 1) any period of loss of a decreased level of consciousness (LOC), 2) any loss of memory for events immediately before or after the injury, 3) any alteration in mental state at the time of the injury (confusion, disorientation, slowed thinking, etc.), 4) neurological deficits (weakness, loss of balance, change in vision, praxis, paresis/plegia, sensory loss, aphasia, etc.) that may or may not be transient, or 5) the presence of an intracranial lesion (1). Diagnosing TBI currently depends on a thorough history and the patient's status at the time of injury, and there is currently no single objective test or diagnostic biomarker for concussion/mild TBI (mTBI). Advancing diagnostic efforts, the U.S. Army Medical Research and Materiel Command is funding biomarker studies to identify the unique biological effects of TBI and leverage knowledge to develop more objective diagnostic tools to determine the severity of brain injury. TBI severity within the DoD are currently classified as mild/moderate/severe (1). Concussion/mTBI involves normal structural imaging, LOC for up to 30 min, alteration of consciousness up to 24 h, and post-traumatic amnesia up to 24 h. If a patient meets criteria in more than one category of severity, the provider assigns the higher severity level. Definition standardization remains a problem as concussion grading systems and definitions published by various organizations make comparing findings from various research studies extremely difficult. A collaborative effort among the DoD, Veterans Health Administration, Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, the Brain Trauma Foundation, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is developing a medically useful definition and staging criteria for mTBI/concussion. We live in a sport-crazed society, and although injury is usually an accepted consequence of “playing the game,” there is a heightened awareness about sport concussions. Pick up a newspaper, or watch the evening news or “Sports Center,” and you're bound to read or hear something about sport concussions. The media are obsessed with this topic, particularly with the negative news that makes headlines and ultimately sells newspapers. Even so, there is good news to report, and progress is being made. Forty-nine states have passed concussion laws in the past 4 years, aimed at educating athletes, parents, and coaches about the symptoms of concussion and the dangers of continuing to play while still symptomatic. According to the CDC, Emergency Department diagnosis of youth sport concussions has increased by an estimated 60% over the past decade (2). Surprisingly, this is good news, as it speaks to the increased public awareness and better recognition of concussion, as opposed to an increase in actual concussions. Concussion remains a major military concern given the short- and long-term impacts to our service members; recent conflicts have sparked an increase in TBI research funding designed to accelerate medical innovation. There were 266,810 service members in the DoD from 2000 to 2012 who were diagnosed with TBI—81.7% of these injuries concussions (3). Although the risk for TBI is certainly higher in the combat environment, the majority of these injuries (83.4%) is actually nondeployment-associated (3). In parallel to sport-concussion awareness, military medicine has also taken significant policy steps to promote early identification and concussion treatment (4). In 2010, the DoD published a policy mandating that any deployed service member involved in a potentially concussive event (such as 50 m from a blast, vehicle collision or rollover, blow to the head, etc.) receive a medical evaluation using the Military Acute Concussion Evaluation; receive a minimum 24 h of downtime, even if he was not diagnosed with a concussion; and must be re-evaluated prior to returning to duty (5). Since then, the DoD has screened over 14,950 deployed service members for concussion and has staffed 11 Concussion Care Centers in Afghanistan that promote concussion recovery and medical oversight (internal DoD data; personal communication). The U.S. Army is implementing this concept worldwide to ensure one standard of concussion care, whether the injury occurs on the battlefield or in garrison. The Veterans Administration-DoD Clinical Practice Guidelines (6) were rated as the highest concussion-management guideline in a 2011 edition of Brain Injury (7). Beginning in 2009, the DoD has published numerous TBI clinical recommendations in collaboration with civilian experts in the areas of cognitive rehabilitation, driving assessment, postinjury neurocognitive testing in the deployed environment, management of neuroendocrine dysfunction, assessment and treatment of dizziness, and management of visual dysfunction (8), and an additional three clinical recommendations will be published this year to include graded return to activity, sleep disturbances, and use of neuroimaging. The tests for detecting concussion and tracking recovery are becoming more sensitive, especially when used in combination with other tools to create a multimodal approach to concussion assessment. Despite all that has been accomplished, caring for service members and athletes at risk for sustaining cerebral concussion has always been a challenging task and never more so than in today's litigious society. Concussion is different from other injuries, in that we still rely heavily on an athlete's or a service member's subjective reporting of symptoms for decisionmaking, and we lack the neuroimaging protocols that might allow us to identify the damage and understand its severity. The cause-and-effect relationships, or lack of same, between repetitive head trauma and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer and chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) are the subject of significant debate. Several published case reports have described tau deposits in the brains of deceased contact-sport athletes, but most of the neuroscience community does not believe that controlled experimental research has yet identified a causal relationship linking repetitive head trauma in sports and CTE(9–12). Innovative neuroimaging techniques are on the horizon and will eventually permit tau and other proteins to be traced in vivo. This should allow for prospective investigations comparing head-impact exposure with tau accumulation, leading to earlier detection and interventions for these chronic neurodegenerative diseases. In the meantime, our responsibility is to safely care for our service members and athletes, to educate them about what is known and unknown regarding the long-term effects of repetitive head trauma, and to ensure that family members, coaches, and military unit leaders implement supportive recovery practices. Unfortunately, the large amount of misinformation on this topic sometimes results in hysteria rather than rational thinking. Concussions are like snowflakes: no two are alike, and no cookbook or calendar can specify exactly how they should be treated. Therefore, we need to go the extra mile. In many cases, it's a matter of counseling our service members and our athletes about the short- and long-term risks of not reporting symptoms, returning to play or duty while still experiencing symptoms, or not modifying risky behaviors that can predispose them to future concussions. We need individualized and sport-specific return-to-play progressions that ensure that service members and athletes are physically and cognitively prepared to return to activity. No checkbox system can be applied to every concussion, and as concussions are diverse and unique injuries that affect each athlete differently, we must learn how to treat them individually. Likewise, concussed service members and athletes are unique, and we must work to understand what makes them different. Sports medicine clinicians must play the important role of counselor to our athletes. Getting to know each athlete's mindset and reaction to injuries allows us to build trust and forge honest lines of communications, thus enabling us to develop an appropriate and individualized plan for managing concussion, which is just as vital as knowing how to interpret the results of a cognitive or balance test. Within a 6-month period, four major consensus or evidence-based documents focused on concussion management will have been released, including the new “Zurich International Guidelines” or the Consensus Statement on Concussion in Sport: the 4th International Conference on Concussion in Sport (13–16). This, along with other manuscripts published or soon to be published by the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine, the American Academy of Neurology, and the National Athletic Trainers' Association, should all be mandatory reading for sports medicine clinicians, as they will define the standard of care for sports medicine clinicians for at least the next 4–5 years. These documents are well-prepared and will make significant contributions to the sports medicine community. The landscape is changing, and these evidence-based guidelines are leading us in a better direction. Although the neuroscience community has learned much about concussion in the last two decades, we admittedly have much more to investigate and to understand.",

The necessity to act, and the urgency of the act in adolescence has been observed as well in adolescents that have health problems as in adolescents in good health. It is not possible to separate the acts that are symptoms of a pathological organization from the acts that are an expression of a normal psychology, but there is a tendency to conceive as psychopathological that which comes into conflict with, and that which is a transgression to, the laws of the social environment, and the biological laws. It is important for the clinical physician to know the social projections on the adolescent. In certain cases, the act is a play out of the fantasy organization of the adolescent and is a reflection of the personality of the subject: in other cases the symptom-acts are a summary of a past relationship, towards which it expresses an ending or a split; the act in an adolescent is all the more a symptom that it is isolated from a relationship.",

Cerebral palsy is quite distinct from spina bifida, even though the affected children may be similarly wheelchair bound. Brain injury is rarely discriminating: damage to the motor area is likely to be accompanied by damage to other areas. Many kinds of cerebral palsy are difficult to detect or, at least, diagnostically differentiate in the first few months of life. The complexity and uncertainty surrounding cerebral palsy have been outlined in order that the following, necessarily simplified, descriptive account is seen as a great deal tidier than the reality. Athetosis shows itself in rapid fluctuations of muscle tone which results in facial contortions and grimaces, and writhing movements of the limbs, especially when the child is excited or making an effort to do something.",

      "title": "Seizures",
      "abstract": "Seizures occur when bursts of uncontrolled electrical activity translate into motor activity. Seizure activity takes on a variety of presentations, depending upon the patient and the degree to which one or both cerebral hemispheres are involved. Generalized seizures are characterized by whole-body involvement, collapse, and loss of consciousness. Patients often exhibit extensor rigidity in all four limbs. Limbs also frequently demonstrate paddling behavior. Unconscious behaviors, such as chewing, licking, swallowing, and vocalizing, may emerge during seizure activity. Autonomic signs may also appear. It is not uncommon for patients to lose control over their urinary bladders or bowels. At times, seizures may be difficult to differentiate from syncopal episodes. Thorough history taking may help to distinguish the two. Partial seizures, on the other hand, may resemble dyskinesias. Partial seizures involve one region of one cerebral hemisphere, and may therefore target any part of the body. The neck, trunk, or limbs are most commonly involved. There are many causes of seizures, regardless of whether they are generalized or partial. For ease of consideration, causes of seizure activity may be described as being intra- or extracranial. These categories prioritize differentials differently based upon the patient's age. In a pediatric patient, meaning one that is less than one year of age, seizures are most likely due to a developmental defect or traumatic injury. Other common causes of pediatric seizures include hepatic encephalopathy (HE), as from a portosystemic shunt (PSS) or neonatal hypoglycemia. Young adult to middle-aged patients, on the other hand, are more likely to develop idiopathic epilepsy, as compared to seniors, which are more likely to develop intracranial neoplasia. Most seizures are self-limiting. However, a fraction of seizures may become protracted, either in terms of their duration or frequency. Cluster seizures occur when the frequency of seizures exceeds two over a 24-h period. Status epilepticus occurs when either a seizure lasts for more than 5 min, or multiple seizures overlap such that patient recovery time between events is eliminated. Status epilepticus is a medical emergency.",

      "title": "Temporomandibular joint dislocation due to atypical antipsychotic-induced acute dystonia: a case report",
      "abstract": "Dystonia is a movement disorder that causes sustained muscle contractions, repetitive twisting movements, and abnormal postures of the trunk, neck, face, arms or legs [Fahn et al. 1987]. It may be focal, segmental (multifocal), or generalized and may also be primary or secondary based on their etiology. It may manifest as oculogyric crisis, deviation of eyes in all directions, protrusion of tongue, trismus, lock jaw, torticolis, laryngeal spasm, difficulty in speaking, facial grimacing, opisthotonus, lordosis or scoliosis and tortipelvic crisis. Drug-induced dystonia are secondary dystonias which occur commonly with drugs with antidopaminergic effects such as antipsychotics and metoclopramide [Ropper and Samuels, 2009; Fadare and Owolabi, 2009]. They reportedly arise from a drug-induced alteration of dopaminergic–cholinergic balance in the nigrostriatum (i.e. basal ganglia). Most drugs produce dystonic reactions by nigrostriatal dopamine D2 receptor blockade, which leads to an excess of striatal cholinergic output. High-potency D2 receptor antagonists are most likely to produce an acute dystonic reaction [Marsden and Jenner, 1980]. Agents that balance dopamine blockade with muscarinic M1 receptor blockade, such as atypical antipsychotics, are less likely to cause dystonic reactions [Marsden and Jenner, 1980; Volkow et al. 1998]. The incidence of acute dystonic reactions varies according to individual susceptibility, drug identity and dose of the drug. Increased age may carry less risk for the development of dystonia because of diminished numbers of D2 receptors. It occurs commonly to young males who are naive to antidopaminergic drugs [Volkow et al. 1998].\r\n\r\nOromandibular dystonia is one of the focal dystonias, which can be presented as jaw clenching, jaw opening or jaw deviation and leads to impaired speech and swallowing [Eken et al. 2009]. At times, oromandibular dystonia is so severe that it can cause temporomandibular joint (TMJ) dislocation. So far, few case reports have been published about TMJ dislocation due to antipsychotic medications [Ibrahim and Brooks, 1996]. Among antipsychotic-induced TMJ dislocation, case reports were mainly for high-potency first-generation antipsychotics such as haloperidol [Eken et al. 2009; Ibrahim and Brooks, 1996; Zakariaei et al. 2012]. It has been proposed that drugs such as risperidone and amisulpride which block specific receptors of serotonin (the S-HT2 receptors) and dopamine (the D2 receptors) are less likely to cause these effects [Owens, 1994]. Therefore, the present paper reports a case of oromandibular dystonia with TMJ dislocation with atypical antipsychotics such as risperidone and amisulpride.",

      "abstract": "Catatonia is a syndrome of primarily psychomotor disturbances associated with typical abnormalities of muscle tone. It is characterized by the co-occurrence of several symptoms of decreased, increased, or abnormal psychomotor activity. Catatonia is a neuropsychiatric syndrome, not an independent nosological entity. Historically associated mainly with schizophrenia (e.g., catatonic subtype), ICD-11, similarly to DSM-5, now recognizes catatonia under a separate classification category, apart from psychotic disorders. In addition to schizophrenia and other primary psychotic disorders, it can occur in the context of other mental disorders, such as mood disorders, or neurodevelopmental disorders, especially autism spectrum disorder. Catatonia can also develop during or immediately after intoxication or withdrawal from psychoactive substances, including phencyclidine, cannabis, hallucinogens such as mescaline or LSD, cocaine and MDMA or related drugs, or during the use of some psychoactive and non-psychoactive medications (e.g. antipsychotic medications, benzodiazepines, steroids, disulfiram, ciprofloxacin). Moreover, catatonia can occur as a direct pathophysiological consequence of various nonpsychiatric medical conditions, e.g., diabetic ketoacidosis, hypercalcemia, hepatic encephalopathy, homocystinuria, neoplasms head trauma, cerebrovascular disease, or encephalitis. Due to the fact that catatonia was mostly associated witch schizophrenia, many cases were not diagnosed and thus did not receive indicated treatment. There are no specific “anti-catatonic” drugs, first-line treatment are benzodiazepines and ECT, in addition to the symptomatic and supportive therapy. The recognition of catatonia as an independent category in ICD-11 can improve medical care for catatonic patients in clinical practice. Disclosure No significant relationships.",

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title> Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can lead to chronic complications, including headache and facial hypersensitivity. Second-impact syndrome (SIS), occurring when a second TBI precedes recovery from an initial injury, often causes severe long-term symptoms. Neuroinflammation is implicated, but the comprehensive pathophysiology of SIS remains unclear. This study characterized neurological/behavioral outcomes, facial nociception, plasma inflammatory markers, and central nervous system (CNS) histopathology in rat models of SIS and single mild TBI. Female Wistar rats (n = 6/group) were assigned to naïve control, sham surgery, single impact (TBI), or double impact (SIS; intervals: 1h, 24h, 3d, 7d, 14d). Mild TBI was induced using a modified Marmarou weight-drop model. Assessments (facial mechanical sensitivity via von Frey, Neurological Severity Scale (NSS), Neurobehavioral Scale (NBS)) were performed pre-injury and on days 1,3,5,7 post-injury. Plasma IL-6 and TNF-α were measured by ELISA. Histopathology (H&amp;E) assessed CNS inflammation. All impact groups developed transient facial mechanical allodynia and acute neurobehavioral deficits (impaired NSS/NBS at day 1). SIS groups, particularly with longer intervals (≥ 24h), exhibited more prolonged facial allodynia and significant neurological deficits compared to single TBI at specific timepoints. Plasma cytokines showed minimal changes. Histopathology revealed significantly elevated CNS inflammation in both TBI and SIS groups versus controls, with SIS groups (intervals 24h-14d) showing robust responses. Repeated TBI, especially with longer recovery intervals between injuries, results in more severe and prolonged facial allodynia, neurological deficits, and CNS neuroinflammation than a single mild TBI. These findings illuminate SIS pathophysiology and underscore the critical need for protection post-concussion.",

      "abstract": "Soggetti portatori di disabilitŕ presentano spesso disturbi endocrini e metabolici, primitivi o secondari alla menomazione psico-fisica. La disabilitŕ č spesso provocata da malattie geneticamente determinate, da traumi cranici o midollari con conseguenti alterazioni neurologiche, o da patologie infettive cerebrali con esiti significativi. Si comprende quindi facilmente la possibile associazione fra la disabilitŕ e disordini della funzione ipotalamica e ipofisaria, con quadri di ipopituitarismo di varia entitŕ. Ne conseguono manifestazioni cliniche, spesso subdole e non facilmente diagnosticabili, almeno nella fase iniziale, che, se non vengono riconosciute tempestivamente, possono avere conseguenze serie. Ad esempio un deficit di ormone della crescita o dell'ormone tiroideo o una carenza di cortisolo, in etŕ infantile possono dar luogo a gravi conseguenze patologiche. Un'altra patologia associata alla disabilitŕ č l'obesitŕ, sia ipotalamica che conseguente alla scarsa attivitŕ fisica. L'obesitŕ facilita lo sviluppo di diabete mellito, peraltro associato talora a malattie geneticamente determinate. Pertanto in una struttura residenziale per disabili č necessaria la consulenza di uno specialista endocrinologo al fine di riconoscere tempestivamente, sulla base di esami clinici e di laboratorio, eventuali patologie endocrine e metaboliche. Questo consente di intraprendere subito una terapia sostitutiva. L'assistenza sanitaria specialistica comprende l'attuazione di schemi di terapia adeguati, la compliance alla terapia, l'attuazione di idonei percorsi diagnostici e di follow-up. Grandi difficoltŕ si incontrano inevitabilmente nell'attuare programmi di attivitŕ fisica e di dieta al fine di limitare l'aumento ponderale. Un corretto intervento in questo campo richiede la collaborazione fra lo specialista e la strut- tura residenziale che assiste il disabile e percorsi di facilitazione per queste attivitŕ anche attraverso convenzioni stipulate ad hoc. Č fondamentale, infine, l'ottimizzazione di un'assistenza multidisciplinare ben integrata.",

      "title": "La bebida compulsiva en polidipsia inducida por programa como rasgo de vulnerabilidad psicopatológica en ratas: implicaciones de la serotonina en su desarrollo y mantenimiento",
      "abstract": "El control inhibitorio de la conducta juega un papel clave en la adaptacion del ser humano al mundo que le rodea. Saber detener una determinada accion a tiempo en respuesta a un cambio situacional, ya sea la aparicion de consecuencias negativas de la misma o sencillamente la consecucion del objetivo por el que dicha accion se inicio, es esencial para el funcionamiento psicologico y social de la persona. Cuando una conducta es repetida de forma persistente a pesar de resultar en consecuencias indeseables y ademas de no perseguir un objetivo concreto, hablamos de compulsividad. La manifestacion mas extrema de la compulsividad, a la vez de tener un alto coste a nivel economico y social, es la psicopatologia. En el caso del trastorno obsesivo-compulsivo (TOC), el cual afecta aproximadamente a un 2% de la poblacion general (Ruscio et al., 2008),el deterioro funcional causado por la ansiedad, los pensamientos intrusivos recurrentes y la inflexibilidad conductual que sufren estos pacientes es bastante severo (van Westen et al.,2015).Ademas, un reciente estudio multigeneracional realizado con humanos revela que los pacientes con un primer diagnostico de TOC tienen doce veces mas riesgo de tener un diagnostico comorbido de esquizofrenia (Cederlof et al., 2014), mientras que tambien se ha sugerido vulnerabilidad a la esquizofrenia en pacientes de TOC (Peng et al., 2012). A nivel neuroquimico, existen observaciones clinicas que prueban la implicacion de la serotonina en TOC (Angoa-Perez et al., 2012) y estudios con animales y humanos han mostrado la implicacion delos subtipos de receptores serotonergicos5-HT2A/C en la conducta compulsiva (para revision, ver Aznar y Klein, 2013; Fineberg et al., 2010; 2011). La presente Tesis Doctoral se ha dirigido a evaluar la participacion de la compulsividad como un factor de vulnerabilidad en diferentes sintomas de esquizofrenia y el papel de la serotonina en el establecimiento de la conducta compulsiva y su mantenimiento. Para ello, se ha partido de un modelo animal de compulsividad, la polidipsia inducida por programa (PIP; Falk, 1961, 1971), para obtener dos poblaciones de ratas diferentes, altas bebedoras (AB) compulsivas y bajas bebedoras (BB), y posteriormente evaluar su ejecucion en otros modelos animales de psicopatologia como son la Inhibicion latente (IL) y el Reversal learning (RL). Ademas, teniendo en cuenta que las anormalidades en la sustancia blanca son un biomarcador de esquizofrenia, se realizo la tecnica de tincion inmunohistoquimica Myelin Basic Protein (MBP) en el cuerpo calloso, estriado y amigdala basolateral de los cerebros del subgrupo de ratas no preexpuestas del experimento de IL. Escogimos este ultimo grupo de animales para descartar cualquier posible efecto del aprendizaje derivado de la preexposicion sobre los resultados de la tincion en dichas areas cerebrales. En la segunda serie experimental de la presente Tesis Doctoral se evaluaron los efectos de la deplecion cronica de triptofano (TRP), un precursor de la serotonina, sobre la bebida compulsiva en PIP y la actividad locomotora en el test de campo abierto en ratas Lister Hooded y Wistar con el fin de comprobar si los efectos de las manipulaciones serotonergicas sobre la conducta son dependientes de la raza de los animales. Ademas, se midieron los niveles de dopamina, adrenalina, serotonina y su metabolito, asi como la union de los receptores serotonergicos 5-HT2A y 5-HT1A en el cortex prefrontal, estriado, nucleo accumbens, hipocampo y amigdala. Una vez probada la participacion de la serotonina en la bebida compulsiva en SIP, se realizo un tercer estudio con ratas Wistar para averiguar la funcionalidad de los receptores serotonergicos sobre la conducta compulsiva. Para este fin, se seleccionaron mediante PIP tres grupos experimentales de ratas AB y BB en los que se probaron los efectos de la administracion sistemica aguda de diferentes compuestos serotonergicos sobre la PIP. En el primer experimento se evaluaron los efectos del inhibidor selectivo de la recaptacion de serotonina (ISRS) citalopram, el inhibidor de recaptacion de noradrenalina atomoxetina y el agonista de los receptores serotonergicos 5-HT2A/C DOI en PIP. En el segundo experimento se evaluaron los efectos del antagonista de los receptores serotonergicos5-HT2A ketanserin, del antagonista altamente especifico de los receptores serotonergicos5-HT2A M100907 y del antagonista altamente especifico de los receptores serotonergicos 5-HT2C SB242048, en PIP. En el tercer experimento se evaluaron los efectos en PIP de las combinaciones de los antagonistas de los receptores serotonergicos 5-HT2A ketanserin, M100907y el antagonista de los receptores 5-HT2C SB242048 con la administracion del agonista de los receptores 5-HT2A/C DOI. Los resultados de la presente tesis doctoral han proporcionado informacion relevante sobre la presencia de un deficit de atencion selectiva en ratas con fenotipo compulsivo (AB) en la tarea de IL, ademas de la capacidad del intervalo variable 60 (IV 60) de inducir respuesta compulsiva en ratas tambien en presion de palanca. A estos resultados hay que anadir que cuando se midieron las diferencias en mielina en estas ratas mediante el protocolo MBP, se observo menor mielinizacion en el cuerpo calloso, estriado y amigdala basolateral de las ratas AB compulsivas. Este mismo fenotipo de ratas compulsivas AB mostro inflexibilidad conductual cuando se evaluo su rendimiento en la tarea de RL, donde mostraron peor ejecucion de la tarea que las ratas BB en todas las variables, asi como mayor numero de errores de perseveracion. Sin embargo, las ratas AB no mostraron ningun deficit de aprendizaje en este modelo. Ademas, las ratas compulsivas AB de la raza Wistar mostraron mas sensibilidad a la deplecion cronica de triptofano mediante dieta en PIP, mientras que entre las ratas BB Wistar y las Lister Hooded no se obtuvieron dichas diferencias. En actividad locomotora, sin embargo, si se encontraron diferencias entre ratas privadas y no privadas de triptofano en la raza Lister Hooded, mientras que en Wistar dicha privacion no tuvo ningun efecto. Ademas, la union del receptor 5-HT2A estaba reducida en el estriado de las ratas AB Wistar privadas de triptofano, mientras que la union del receptor 5-HT1A estaba reducida en cortex frontal de las ratas Lister Hooded privadas de triptofano. Para terminar, cuando se administraron los compuestos serotonergico escitalopram, atomoxetina, DOI, ketanserin, SB242084y M100907 para evaluar su efecto sobre la bebida compulsiva en PIP, se observo que el citalopram y DOI redujeron la bebida compulsiva en PIP en ratas AB compulsivas comparadas con las BB. En cambio, SB242084 aumento la bebida compulsiva en PIP en ratas AB comparadas con BB. Sin embargo, la atomoxetina, el ketanserin y el M100907 no tuvieron ningun efecto sobre la bebida en PIP cuando se administraron solos. Posteriormente, se observo que cuando la reduccion de la bebida compulsiva en PIP provocada por DOI era bloqueada por la administracion de M100907 y ketanserin, ambos antagonistas de del receptor serotonergico 5-HT2A. En conclusion, la presente Tesis Doctoral proporciona datos relevantes sobre la presencia de sintomas de esquizofrenia en ratas AB compulsivas, como son la alteracion en la atencion selectiva y la inflexibilidad cognitiva, y la vulnerabilidad de dichas ratas a desarrollar conducta compulsiva bajo determinados programas de reforzamiento. Ademas se aporta que la deplecion cronica de triptofano en ratas Wistar aumenta la respuesta compulsiva, produce cambios en la union de receptores serotonergicos en determinadas areas cerebrales y que la activacion de los receptores serotonergicos 5-HT2A inhiben a su vez este comportamiento compulsivo. En conjunto, nuestros resultados sugieren la existencia de vulnerabilidad a los trastornos psicoticos dentro del fenotipo compulsivo y la implicacion del sistema serotonergico en dicha vulnerabilidad, concretamente de los receptores 5-HT2A, los cuales podrian tener papel modulador en la manifestacion de los sintomas estudiados.",

      "title": "La polidipsia inducida por programa como modelo de conducta compulsiva: inflexibilidad conductual , excesiva formación de hábitos y sus correlatos neurobiológicos",
      "abstract": "La conducta compulsiva se ha definido como acciones inapropiadas para la situacion, que son persistentes, no tienen una relacion obvia con el objetivo de dicha conducta, y que a menudo tienen consecuencias indeseables. Este sintoma esta presente en varios trastornos psiquiatricos, como el trastorno obsesivo compulsivo (TOC), el trastorno dismorfico corporal, el trastorno de acumulacion, tricotilomania y el trastorno por excoriacion, que estan agrupados en la categoria Trastorno Obsesivo-Compulsivo y trastornos asociados del Manual Diagnostico y Estadistico de los Trastornos Mentales (quinta edicion). Sin embargo, en la mayoria de casos con diagnostico de TOC suele haber comorbilidad con otros trastornos psiquiatricos, como ansiedad, trastornos alimentarios, depresion, trastornos del control de impulsos o abuso de sustancias. Por ello, hay un creciente interes en identificar dominios neuroconductuales transdiagnosticos, como la inflexibilidad conductual o la formacion excesiva de habitos, para desarrollar modelos traslacionales eficaces que permitan estudiar la compleja neuropatologia de la compulsividad. Esta conducta esta relacionada con niveles alterados de monoaminas, concretamente de la serotonina (5-hidroxitriptamina-5-HT) y sus receptores. Dado que la microbiota intestinal regula el metabolismo del precursor de 5-HT (triptofano-TRP) y puede afectar a la sintesis global de 5-HT, un mal funcionamiento del eje microbiota-intestino-cerebro puede estar involucrado en la compulsividad. En la presente Tesis Doctoral estudiamos la conducta compulsiva con un modelo animal denominado Polidipsia Inducida por Programa (PIP), que se caracteriza por el desarrollo de bebida persistente y excesiva bajo un programa de reforzamiento intermitente de comida. La cantidad de agua ingerida en SIP varia entre razas de ratas y entre los individuos de una misma raza, permitiendo la clasificacion de dos poblaciones segun sus diferencias individuales: ratas Altas Bebedoras (AB) y Bajas Bebedoras (BB). Los principales objetivos de la Tesis Doctoral fueron: Primero, explorar los dominios neuroconductuales, como la flexibilidad conductual y la formacion de habitos, y los sustratos neurobiologicos que estan a la base de la vulnerabilidad a desarrollar bebida compulsiva en PIP. Segundo, dada la estrecha relacion entre la compulsividad y el sistema serotoninergico, investigar los efectos de la reduccion de serotonina mediante la exposicion cronica a una dieta carente de TRP en la bebida compulsiva en PIP y en la microbiota intestinal. Los resultados de la primera serie experimental revelaron que las ratas AB exhibieron inflexibilidad conductual en una tarea de aprendizaje inverso, y excesiva formacion de habitos en una tarea de devaluacion del reforzador. Este grupo tambien mostro elevados niveles en plasma de la hormona de estres corticosterona tras la exposicion a la PIP, lo cual indica que la PIP puede representar un contexto estresante para individuos vulnerables. Ademas, las ratas AB tuvieron una concentracion normal de sodio en suero, lo que aporta pruebas de que los marcadores conductuales, neuroquimicos y neuroanatomicos de compulsividad en la PIP no son consecuencia de dano cerebral asociado a hiponatremia. Asimismo, identificamos patrones microestructurales especificos de lametones en diferentes razas de ratas, mostrando que la raza de ratas Wistar tenia alta frecuencia e intensidad de lametones comparada con el resto de razas, lo cual interpretamos como una formacion de habito descontrolado en PIP. En las ratas que mostraron alta frecuencia e intensidad de lametones en PIP se observo una hiperactividad anormal de la corteza orbitofrontal lateral y de la amigdala basolateral, areas cerebrales que estan involucradas en la flexibilidad conductual y el control de acciones dirigidas a meta. En la segunda serie experimental encontramos que la deplecion cronica de TRP, la cual redujo de forma efectiva los niveles de serotonina en el cerebro y en plasma, afecto las ratas AB Wistar en comparacion con las ratas BB Wistar y Lister Hooded. Las ratas depletadas de TRP AB Wistar incrementaron los lametones en PIP, tuvieron una reduccion del binding del receptor 5-HT2A y mostraron una estructura de la comunidad bacteriana fecal menos equilibrada comparadas con el resto de grupos. Ademas, las AB en comparacion con las ratas BB mostraron una menor diversidad bacteriana, independientemente de la dieta. Segun los resultados obtenidos, podemos concluir que la inflexibilidad conductual y la excesiva formacion de habitos son marcadores neuroconductuales que predicen la conducta compulsiva. Ademas, identificamos varios marcadores biologicos de la compulsividad, como hiperactividad de la corteza orbitofrontal y de la amigdala basolateral, niveles reducidos del receptor serotoninergico 2A en el estriado y diversidad bacteriana reducida de la microbiota intestinal. Tambien aportamos evidencias sobre la relacion entre el sistema serotoninergico y la conducta compulsiva, mostrando que la reduccion de serotonina incrementa la conducta compulsiva en PIP y desequilibra la microbiota intestinal en poblaciones vulnerables.",

      "abstract": "Psychogenic or functional movement disorders (PMDs) may occur at almost any age, particularly those affecting vulnerable populations. Mostly, that are not explained by an specifiable organic disease and that especially related to psychiatric underlying cause. Psychogenic gait disorders (PGDs) may be fluctuations during a physical exam-particularly an increase of movement following attention, and a decrease when the person is distracted. Useful clues suggesting psychogenic gait problems are acute onset, selective disability, false weakness, bizarre tremor, astasia-abasia (a lurching gait with repeated near falls). If one or more of these features were present, the diagnosis of psychogenic gait disturbance could be made on phenomenological grounds alone with over 90% certainty. But, as with other pseudoneurologic signs, normal underlying neurological function must be demonstrated. Here, we describe a 54-year-old case who had suffered from postural instability, unusual gait disturbance with excessive slowness for about 7 years before, following a stressful life event.",

      "title": "Feeding and swallowing dysfunction in genetic syndromes",
      "abstract": "Abstract Children with genetic syndromes frequently have feeding problems and swallowing dysfunction as a result of the complex interactions between anatomical, medical, physiological, and behavioral factors. Feeding problems associated with genetic disorders may also cause feeding to be unpleasant, negative, or even painful because of choking, coughing, gagging, fatigue, or emesis, resulting in the child to stop eating and to develop behaviors that make it difficult, if not impossible, for a parent to feed their child. In addition, limited experiences with oral intake related to the medical or physical conditions, or other variables such as prematurity, often result in a failure of the child's oral motor skills to develop normally. For example, a child with Pierre Robin sequence may be unable to successfully feed orally, initially, due to micrognathia and glossoptosis. Oral‐motor dysfunction may develop as a result of both anatomical problems, (e.g., cleft lip/palate), lack of experience (e.g., s/p. surgery), or oral motor abnormalities (e.g., brain malformation). Neuromotor coordination impairments such as those associated with Down syndrome (e.g., hypotonia, poor tongue control, and open mouth posture) frequently interfere with the acquisition of effective oral‐motor skills and lead to feeding difficulties. Management of these phenomena is frequently possible, if an appropriate feeding plan exist that allows for three primary factors: (1) feeding program must be safe, (2) feeding program must support optimal growth, and (3) feeding program must be realistic. Researchers have demonstrated the utility of behavioral approaches in the treatment of feeding disorders, such as manipulations in the presentation of foods and drink and consequences for food refusal and acceptance (e.g., praise, extinction, contingent access to preferred foods). However, because a child's failure to eat is not frequently the result of a single cause, evaluation and treatment are typically conducted by an interdisciplinary team usually consisting of a behavioral psychologist, pediatric gastroenterologist, speech pathologist, nutrition, and sometimes other disciplines. This chapter provides an overview of some of the feeding difficulties experience by some of the more common genetic disorders including identification, interventions, and management. © 2008 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a severe mental condition that can cause significant disability in which people interpret reality abnormally. If neglected, it leads to serious issues that impact all facets of life. It affects about one percent of the world’s population. According to World Health Organization (WHO) schizophrenia affects approximately 24 million people worldwide, which is equivalent to 1 in 300 people (0.32%). It involves a range of problems with cognition, behavior and emotions. Signs and symptoms may vary, but usually involve delusions, hallucinations or disorganized speech, and reflect an impaired ability to function. The pathomechanism of schizophrenia is not fully understood and current antipsychotics are characterized by many limitations. A 30 year old male presented with the symptoms of increased anger, impulsivity, irritability, feeling that others are talking about him and trying to harm him, somebody is following him and controlling all his actions. Others are able to access to his thoughts through mobile phone, unable to concentrate on his works, beating mother since 8 months. Paittika unmada symptoms such as Amarsha (keeping rivalry), Krodha (anger), Swesham paresham va abhidravana (harming self and others), and Kaphaja unmada symptoms such as Rahaskamata (likes sitting alone), Thushnibaava (reduced speech) were the presenting symptoms, so the condition was diagnosed as schizophrenia as per ICD 11 (Paittika unmada with Kaphanubanda) and treatment protocol was selected according to the predominant Dosha level. The assessment tool used was PANSS (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale). After Shirodhara, Snehapana, Virechana, Nasya and Samana PANSS Score reduced from 66 to 34. In the current Ayurvedic protocol showed better outcome in the management of Schizophrenia. Future research should focus on the potential of the Ayurvedic protocol for better management and an enhanced quality of life.",

Establish the onset of problem, and whether it is acute, subacute, or chronic. Vertigo is usually paroxysmal. Constant vertigo suggests psychogenic and not vestibular dysfunction. Chronic conditions such as acoustic neuroma rarely present with vertigo. Aggravating factors can be head or body position. Benign positional vertigo accounts for about half of all cases of vertigo. Associated symptoms: nausea, vomiting, fullness of ears, hearing loss, tinnitus, all of which suggest otological etiologies; headaches, diplopia, blurred vision, ataxia, paresthesia, all suggestive of central nervous system (CNS) etiologies. History of recent ear or upper respiratory infection or head trauma. History of drug regimen or drug overdose. History of depression or other psychiatric problems. Vertigo that is provoked by exertion, loud noise, sneezing, or coughing (Tullio’s phenomenon) is suggestive of perilymphatic fistula.",

PTSD is an anxiety disorder developed in a person experiencing, wit‐ nessing, or learning about an extreme physically or psychologically distressing event, asso‐ ciated with unprecedented violence [11, 12]. Traumatic events that can trigger PTSD include massacres, mass murder scenes, international, civil, political, ethnic and religious wars, gen‐ ocides, natural and man-made disasters, criminal assaults, serious accidents, terrorist at‐ tacks, incarceration, trafficking, rape and other types of sexual assaults [12-17], life threatening illness and the sudden death of a loved one, serious medical illness, injury, sur‐ gery, hostage, kidnapping, difficult labors, etc [18-20]. Individuals who experience a trauma of this nature may develop symptoms that fall into three distinct clusters: re-experiencing phenomenon; avoidance and numbing; and autonomic hyperarousal. Symptoms usually be‐ gin within the first 3 months after the traumatic event and last for many years, although there may be a delay of months, or even years, before symptoms appear. PTSD patients are characterized by severe emotional state, sharp reduction in adaptive and information receiv‐ ing abilities. They usually remain out of society, become drug addicted, alcoholic and often commit suicide [21-24]. Degrees of risk to develop PTSD from different traumatic events are presented in table 1.",

These three factors are closely interrelated in a complex system of reciprocal influences and mutual dependence. Thus, the performance of monotonous, routine operations results not only in emotional indifference but also in a reduction in the level of alertness, in drowsiness, apathy, loss of attention, slowed reactions, missing of important signals, and rapidly increasing fatigue. Excessive emotional tension, which can arise in any type of unforeseen, out-of-the-ordinary situation or in performing familiar operations when time is at a premium, is characterized by disorganization of activity, overhasty reactions, an increase in the number of errors (mainly false alarms), and, of course, increasing fatigue because of an excess consumption of energy.",

In the absence of abnormal eye movements, it may be indicative of neurological disease (eg, cerebellar disease, basal ganglia dysfunction). We report a neurologically normal infant without nystagmus but with intermittent head nodding and intermittent esotropia, whose head movements manifested only when his eyes were straight. The head movements ceased with the occlusion of either eye or spontaneous onset of esotropia. When his head was forcibly stabilized, he immediately developed esotropia. The head movement presumably facilitated fusion, although the mechanism of action is unknown.",

Acute, chronic, and recovery stages can be recognized if one interprets the direction and intensity of the resultant spontaneous nystagmus relative to the clinical picture. Static asymmetry is additive with induced asymmetry and manifests itself as directional preponderance or as the direction-fixed or direction-changing feature of positional nystagmus.<i>Dynamic asymmetry</i>refers to abnormal asymmetry induced by normal head movements. For example, with unilateral hypo-function, a greater gain is observed with head movement toward the unaffected side, suggesting nonlinearity as specified by Ewald's second law. Visually induced<i>vestibular asymmetry</i>is a form of dynamic asymmetry generated by convergence of visual-vestibular information, and causing symptoms in certain \"motion-active\" visual environments.

They usually occur intermittently or episodically either within sleep or during its transition to and from wakefulness. Occasionally, parasomnias may give rise to violent and potentially injurious behavior. Parasomnias can be classified into three groups based on the American Academy of Sleep Medicine International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD; second edition; see References) (Box 7–1). 1. Disorders of arousal from non–rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, including confusional arousals, sleepwalking, and sleep terrors 2.

These may be sudden, short-lived alterations in visual, psychic, somatosensory, and other sensory experiences. Although auras can precede both simple and complex partial seizures with or without secondary generalized motor convulsions, they, too, may terminate without further evolution. In either case subsequent headache may be experienced after the motor phenomena has terminated.",

Motoric disturbance is mostly caused by central nervous system damage in the first 2 years of life. Chronic movement and postural disturbances in children will hamper their ability to conduct daily activities. Generally, there are 3 domains of management in CP: physical exercise, medications and surgery, and behavioral theraphy. Physiotheraphy is better be given in the first year of life or as soon as the diagnosis of CP established. Physiotheraphy in children with CP includes stretching, empowering, and positioning.

The same agents would not cause decline in an uninjured tree, and the injury alone would not cause decline. 3. Chronic irritation by one or more agents may diminish the tolerance or resistance of a tree to another agent that then incites decline. Various factors including those that predisposed the tree and incited decline may then contribute to further decline. 4.

      "title": "Acute and transient psychotic disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract The heterogeneous group of acute and transient psychotic disorders are characterized by three typical features, listed below in descending order of priority: ♦ suddenness of onset (within 2 weeks or less); ♦ presence of typical syndromes with polymorphic (changing and variable) or schizophrenic symptoms; ♦ presence of associated acute stress (stressful events such as bereavement, job loss, psychological trauma, etc.). The onset of the disorder is manifested by an obvious change to an abnormal psychotic state. This is considered to be abrupt when it occurs within 48 h or less. Abrupt onset often indicates a better outcome. Full recovery occurs within 3 months and often in a shorter time (a few days or weeks). However, a small number of patients develop persistent and disabling states. The general (G) criteria for these acute disorders in DCR-10 (Diagnostic Criteria Research of ICD) are as follows. G1 There is acute onset of delusions, hallucinations, incomprehensible or incoherent speech, or any combination of these. The time interval between the first appearance of any psychotic symptoms and the presentation of the fully developed disorder should not exceed 2 weeks. G2 If transient states of perplexity, misidentification, or impairment of attention and concentration are present, they do not fulfil the criteria for organically caused clouding of consciousness as specified for F05, criterion A. G3 The disorder does not satisfy the symptomatic criteria for manic episode (F30), depressive episode (F32), or recurrent depressive disorder (F33). G4 There is insufficient evidence of recent psychoactive substance use to satisfy the criteria for intoxication (F1x.0), harmful use (F1x.1), dependence (F1x.2), or withdrawal states (F1x.3 and F1x.4). The continued moderate and largely unchanged use of alcohol or drugs in the amounts or with the frequency to which the individual is accustomed does not necessarily exclude the use of F23; this must be decided by clinical judgement and the requirements of the research project in question. G5 There must be no organic mental disorder (F00–F09) or serious metabolic disturbances affecting the central nervous system (this does not include childbirth). (This is the most commonly used exclusion clause.) A fifth character should be used to specify whether the acute onset of the disorder is associated with acute stress (occurring 2 weeks or less before evidence of first psychotic symptoms): ♦ F23.x0 without associated acute stress and ♦ F23.x1 with associated acute stress. For research purposes it is recommended that change of the disorder from a non-psychotic to a clearly psychotic state is further specified as either abrupt (onset within 48 h) or acute (onset in more than 48 h but less than 2 weeks). Six categories of acute psychoses are presented in ICD-10, and we shall discuss them in order.",

Principales signos etiologicos: 1. o El delirio de relacion sensitivo se presenta con mas frecuencia sobre un fondo hereditario muy acentuado en individuos que muestran marcada debilidad de orden reactivo y, a veces, de orden endogeno. 2. o La constitucion psicopatica se resalta, en su aspecto biologico general, ante todo por su gran fatigabilidad. El agotamiento causado por el trabajo o por la presion ejercida por los afectos representa un importante momento auxiliar en la evolucion de la enfermedad. La constitucion sexual muestra, al tiempo que una nitidez de las tendencias pasionales, una dificultad del contacto con el sexo opuesto, una inhibicion extremadamente fuerte de las pulsiones y una carencia del instinto erotico. Dicha constitucion revela los estigmas de una maduracion parcialmente retardada. 3. o La edificacion de la enfermedad, una vez se han admitido los elementos endogenos ya expuestos, es psicologica y reaccional, y se caracteriza por la triada formada por el caracter, la experiencia vivida y el medio. 4. o El delirio de relacion sensitivo esta condicionado por la disposicion caracterial 1; se forma segun reglas precisas: cuanto mas sensitiva es la disposi­ cion, mas tipicas son las manifestaciones del delirio. El caracter sensitivo es enor­ memente astenico. Desde una perspectiva psicologica, se ubica entre el caracter expansivo y el caracter astenico puro. Se caracteriza por una falta de expansion, una incapacidad psiquica de efectuar una descarga. La neurosis de relacion sensi­ tiva se diferencia de la variante obsesiva del caracter sensitivo por el contraste mas acentuado de tensiones interiores. La personalidad de un neurotico sensitivo presenta, por una parte, una suavidad extrema, una debilidad, una sutileza, una vulnerabilidad y, por otra parte, un cierto grado de ambicion, de conciencia en si y de tenacidad. Los representantes mas perfilados de este grupo caracterial son individuos complicados, de elevada inteligencia y de gran valor; poseen una sen­ sibilidad fina y profunda, y poseen una etica escrupulosa. Su vida psiquica inte­ riorizada e hipersensible hace que sean presa facil para las pruebas banales de la vida. Ocultan profundamente sus afectos, y los ocultan durante mucho tiempo.

Nerves injuries are caused by car and labor accidents, by cutting and penetrating objects, crushing, fractures, stretching and gunshot wound, professional or amateur sportsmen injuries. Chronic post-surgical pain is a major clinical problem. Incidence of chronic post-surgical pain varies depending on the type of surgery and surgical technique – after limb amputation, thoracotomy, mastectomy, hysterectomy, hip arthroplasty, cholecystectomy, colectomy, vasectomy, Cesarean section. Such pain can transform into persistent, severe and refractory chronic neuropathic pain, which is a serious social problem because it often affects the most productive population, sometimes causing disability, have a high level of comorbidity in the form of psychopathological conditions, sleep disorders. The pathophysiology and neurotransmission of neuropathic pain have complex and not fully understood mechanisms. They involve produce local and systemic signal pain cytokines, disturbances in the modulation of sensory flows, peripheral and central sensitization, neurotransmitter imbalance, changes in gene expression and implicate of the limbic system and hypothalamus contribute to the modulation of mood and behavior. Options for managing neuropathic pain with nerve damage include a limited number of pharmacological drugs and interventional treatment methods. Main drugs used in relief in neuropathic pain include tricyclics antidepressants and dual norepinephrine/5 hydroxytryptamine reuptake inhibitors, gabapentinoids – gabapentin and pregabalin, capsaicin, opioid analgesics, especially tramadol and methadone are recommended as second line drugs. For patient’s refractory to pharmacotherapy, neurosurgical decompression and nerve reconstruction and neuromodulation procedures are recommended to relieve neuropathic pain.

It is a heterogeneous disorder, in that the extent and severity of the symptoms, cognitive deficits, and social dysfunction vary among individuals. The diagnosis of schizophrenia is based on meeting criteria for the presence of symptoms, decline in functioning, and level of disability and on ruling out other possible causes of the symptoms (e.g., certain neurological disorders, substance abuse). There is no laboratory or medical test that can be used to diagnosis this disorder. One theory is that schizophrenia is not a single disease but an array of disorders that share a final common pathway leading to the brain abnormalities and clinical features associated with this diagnosis.",

      "abstract": "Introduction The natural occurrence of contractions of several muscles when volition calls but one of the muscles into action has been of interest to the neurophysiologist for a long time. Usually, the synkinesis is operative in only one way. For instance, in Bell's phenomenon the closure of the eyelids is accompanied by an upturning of the eyeball, not vice versa. Such associated movements have been recognized as expressions of reflex and coordinative mechanisms within the central nervous system. The unnatural appearance of an unwilled contraction of a muscle when another muscle is called into action has intrigued clinicians and has provoked much thought and speculation. Sometimes such pathologic synkineses have been noted early in life or have not been associated with any history or evidence of disease or trauma. These have been assumed to be congenital or even hereditary in origin. Most times, the associated movements have occurred with a",

Signs of ataxia include clumsiness, unsteady gait, nystagmus (rapid, uncontrolled eye movements), and dysdiadochokinesis (inability to perform rapid alternating movements like foot tapping). Ataxia may be genetic or acquired, such as from illness or trauma. Acute-onset ataxia develops within hours or days. In children with acute ataxia and no recent history of trauma, MRI head without and with contrast, MRI head without contrast, or CT head without contrast is usually appropriate. MR angiography (MRA) head and/or neck, MRI spine, and CT angiography (CTA) head and/or neck may be appropriate. For acute ataxia (after traumatic head or neck injury), MRI head without contrast or CT head without contrast is usually appropriate. MRA head and/or neck and CTA head and/or neck may be appropriate. For recurrent ataxia (episodes of ataxia followed by relatively symptom-free periods), MRI head without contrast is usually appropriate. MRI spectroscopy head or MRI head without and with contrast may be appropriate. For chronic progressive ataxia (symptoms typically appear and increase in severity over at least 2 months), MRI head without and with contrast or MRI head without contrast is usually appropriate. MRI complete spine without or with/without contrast and CT head without contrast may be appropriate. For chronic nonprogressive ataxia (symptoms typically appear in the first year of life, last more than 2 months, and do not change in severity), MRI head without contrast is usually appropriate.

The confused elder is more often anxious, very disoriented, with poor onirism, disturbed sleep, ideas of persecution and behavior disorders. Even if a multiple causality is usual, initiating circumstances come principally from an affective source. There is rupture with customary situation of the elder which hold a plurality of risk factors. These confusional disorders increase with aging and cognitive impairment. Late life delusional subject has also persecutory ideation without dissociation but with emotional reactions and affective changes. Different factors promote birth of late life delusion (personality features, isolation, sensory defect...). On psychodynamic way, these two disorders are issued from a breakdown followed by a more or less durable appointment. Confusion agrees with a somatic and psychic regression (consciousness disorganization). This is an elder's attempt to prevent anxiety. Late life delusion lays on denial and projective mecanisms. It is jointed with prejudice and intrusion (with regard to ownership, health and reputation). This is an elder's attempt to establish defences against depression. In the two situations, treatment consists on a biological regulation associated with psychodynamic approach taking elder personality, actual condition and recent life events into account.",

Aggressive behaviour, however, can also be associated with mental disorders and this is the topic discussed by the present article. Isolated and occasional outbursts of anger, aggressiveness and rage in children and adolescents can often be confused with conduct disorder. However, conduct disorder is characterised by a stable aggressive behavioural pattern, recurrently violating either the basic rights of the others or of the generally accepted social norms. Aggressive behaviour can also be present in Oppositional Defiant Disorder (ODD), Attention Deficit Hyperkinetic Disorder (ADHD), affective and psychotic disorders, autistic spectrum disorders and in some other developmental neurological disorders including intellectual disability ‒ but only as a possible and not a typical symptom. Child and adolescent psychiatrist can mainly help with aggressive behaviour associated with mental disorders.

      "title": "Neurological consequences of traumatic brain injuries in sports",
      "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is common in boxing and other contact sports. The long term irreversible and progressive aftermath of TBI in boxers depicted as punch drunk syndrome was described almost a century ago and is now widely referred as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). The short term sequelae of acute brain injury including subdural haematoma and catastrophic brain injury may lead to death, whereas mild TBI, or concussion, causes functional disturbance and axonal injury rather than gross structural brain damage. Following concussion, symptoms such as dizziness, nausea, reduced attention, amnesia and headache tend to develop acutely but usually resolve within a week or two. Severe concussion can also lead to loss of consciousness. Despite the transient nature of the clinical symptoms, functional neuroimaging, electrophysiological, neuropsychological and neurochemical assessments indicate that the disturbance of concussion takes over a month to return to baseline and neuropathological evaluation shows that concussion-induced axonopathy may persist for years. The developing brains in children and adolescents are more susceptible to concussion than adult brain. The mechanism by which acute TBI may lead to the neurodegenerative process of CTE associated with tau hyperphosphorylation and the development of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) remains speculative. Focal tau-positive NFTs and neurites in close proximity to focal axonal injury and foci of microhaemorrhage and the predilection of CTE-tau pathology for perivascular and subcortical regions suggest that acute TBI-related axonal injury, loss of microvascular integrity, breach of the blood brain barrier, resulting inflammatory cascade and microglia and astrocyte activation are likely to be the basis of the mechanistic link of TBI and CTE. This article provides an overview of the acute and long-term neurological consequences of TBI in sports. Clinical, neuropathological and the possible pathophysiological mechanisms are discussed. This article is part of a Special Issue entitled 'Traumatic Brain Injury'.",

      "title": "377 Head Injury in Children",
      "abstract": "A head injury can be broadly defined as an acute traumatic insult to the head by an external force.While any part of the head can be injured in this way, the focus of this chapter is injuries to the scalp, skull, brain parenchyma, and their associated anatomic structures. Acute head injuries thus covers a wide spectrum of severity, ranging from benign contusions to intracranial hemorrhage, whichmay result in increased intracranial pressure, brainstem herniation, and death. The term traumatic brain injury (TBI) has also been used to encompass the alteration in brain function resulting from a blunt or penetrating force to the head, manifesting as confusion, altered level of consciousness, seizure, coma, or focal sensory or motor neurologic deficit. Head injuries can be classified in many different ways. Isolated injuries to the scalp, skull, and brain can and do occur. However, injuries to more than one structure are commonly encountered. As such, a system of classifying injuries solely on the basis of anatomic location lacks clinical utility. Similarly, classifying injuries on the basis of mechanism (e.g. ‘‘blunt vs. penetrating’’) fails to define head injuries in a clinically meaningful way, as each type of mechanism does not exclusively result in either an open or closed head injury. Therefore, one should not assume that a given mechanism of injury is consistently synonymous with a particular type of injury incurred. Distinguishing open from closed head injuries is another system that is commonly used. Open head injuries occur when blunt or penetrating trauma transgress the scalp and skull, exposing the brain to the external environment. By definition, all open head injuries require emergent neurosurgical consultation. With closed head injuries, on the other hand, the traumatic sequelae or the condition of the intracranial contents may not be readily apparent. Care of these patients will depend on their clinical condition and may also depend on the results of diagnostic imaging. In summary, no single classification system captures all the relevant clinical information of head injuries. The most clinically useful method of categorizing head injuries incorporates elements of all these systems, and includes an assessment of clinical neurologic status (e.g. GlasgowComaScale).",

      "title": "Commentary on Schotte et al. “Development of temporal lobe epilepsy during maintenance electroconvulsive therapy: A case of human kindling?”",
      "abstract": "Kindling is a phenomenon whereby repeated subthreshold stimulations for inducing a particular initial behavior eventually produce that behavior, and with further stimulations additional behaviors are observed.1 It is a model of learning, memory, and epileptogenesis/epilepsy; the latter is because the measured behavior is most often a seizure that becomes progressively more severe. For example, in kindling of the limbic structures in adult rodents, the Racine scale is used.2 These seizures are initially focal and then become bilateral clonic3-5 and eventually tonic (Table 1).2 In experimental studies, kindling can be induced by a variety of electrical or chemical stimuli.3, 4, 6-16 Another form of kindling is the progressive intensification of bilateral (probably generalized) seizures triggered by repeated administration of chemoconvulsants such as flurothyl with associated decrease in the latencies of the onset of the convulsions.17 In almost all the studies, the data suggest that focal seizures eventually become bilateral or the bilateral seizures become more severe. There is only one observation that with repeated audiogenic stimulation in one strain of rats (genetically epilepsy prone rats [GEPR-3]), after a series of bilateral seizures (which are presumed to be of brainstem origin), focal electroencephalography (EEG) discharges appeared in the amygdala with seizure types reminiscent of the Racine stages 1-3.18, 19 The notion that kindling may occur in human epilepsies has been proposed and debated since the first description of the phenomenon by Graham Goddard in 1967.1 There are several excellent reviews on the topic describing the pros and cons of the available studies5, 20 and the evidence is at best scant. This may be due, in part, to the greater number of stimulations needed to elicit kindling, the higher the animal is on the phylogenetic scale.5 Schotte et al21 presented a 67-year-old right-handed woman with no family history of epilepsy or febrile seizures, who had been receiving electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) sessions for medically refractory bipolar disease. She received weekly bilateral temporal ECT for 9 years before being switched to right temporal ECT (weekly initially; then reduced to every other week), due to concerns of cognitive deterioration. In parallel, she had been receiving valproate, among other medications, for management of her bipolar disorder. After 17 years and 800 sessions of bilateral or unilateral ECT, and after reducing the sessions from weekly to every other week, she started manifesting epileptic seizures consisting of hyperventilation, tachycardia, impaired awareness, oral and left hand automatisms, and postictal aphasia. Her video-EEG monitoring captured left more than right temporal epileptic discharges and ictal seizure patterns with bilateral onset, although lateralizing electroclinical signs were suggested (reported as starting at or rapidly propagating to the left temporal, although electrographic onset remains unclear). Subtraction ictal SPECT (single-photon emission computed tomography) coregistered with MRI (SISCOM) showed left hyperperfusion, and interictal fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) with anatomy-corrected asymmetry index analysis showed bilateral but greater on the left hemisphere hypometabolism. No obvious association between the timing of ECT sessions and her seizures was observed. The authors propose that this presentation may be a form of ECT kindling of the development of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) in humans. In this case, this will resemble the studies in the GEPR-3 audiogenic-prone rats and one would have to assume that the ECT seizures are of brainstem origin. Prior reports of epilepsy diagnosed after many episodes of ECT included focal or bilateral onset seizures, while epileptic activity after bitemporal ECT or ipsilateral temporal onset seizures have been reported after unilateral ECT22, 23 and often subside after ECT discontinuation. However, as was the case in the patient described by Schotte et al, ECT discontinuation may not always be possible due to the severity of depression. However, there is an alternative hypothesis that should be considered. The 800 ECT seizures recorded prior to clinical seizure onset could have produced hippocampal injury, and the observed seizures may be a reflection of this injury. The observed cognitive deterioration, reported before the onset of clinical seizures, is supportive evidence. It is also possible that this injury may have been exacerbated by the focal delivery of ECT via a right temporal lobe electrode. This hypothesis could be considered in the interpretation of the data. Of interest, although bilateral temporal pathologies were observed, the interictal pathology (FDG-PET) as well as the lateralizing signs on the ictal SISCOM and electroclinical manifestations showed a preponderance of left temporal pathology, that is, contralateral to the right temporal ECT sessions. If ECT is indeed implicated in the development of TLE in this patient, whether directly by kindling or indirectly as a result of the ensuing temporal lobe pathology, what are the mechanisms responsible for the greater pathology and epileptogenesis at a contralateral focus? Paradoxical lateralizing signs (eg, postictal expressive and receptive aphasia with or without right gaze deviation and right-sided motor signs) have been reported very rarely after right unilateral ECTs of right-handed patients, either immediately after the ECT or postrecovery (“tardive seizures”).24, 25 These have been postulated to reflect “stunning” of eloquent regions after ECT seizure generalization, although it is also likely that underlying predisposing conditions or coadministered drugs may render some patients more vulnerable to manifesting persisting or reactivated seizure foci, contralateral to the ECT. Certainly, the frequency of these paradoxical associations is too low to confirm causality. Furthermore, pre-ECT data on neuroimaging or video-EEG monitoring to determine preexisting pathologies at the contralateral site are missing. The chronic concomitant use of valproate or benzodiazepines for the treatment of psychiatric disorders in some of these patients,21, 25 may have masked or delayed the onset of the clinical manifestations of prior epilepsy. On the contrary, could the unilateral ECT have protected the ipsilateral temporal lobe from injury or propensity to manifest or sustain ictal activity?21, 24, 25 Electroconvulsive seizures result in a period of postictal refractoriness to seizures or epileptic activity26, 27 that may contribute to apparent antiseizure effects. Bilateral ECT has been used to stop superrefractory status epilepticus,28-30 although most studies have been retrospective or case reports, thus warranting further confirmation with prospective studies before recommending its use. Unknowns and possible confounders include the ECT effects on blood-brain barrier permeability and its potential effects on seizure activity or the brain penetration of coadministered drugs (including antiseizure drugs), vascular and cerebral blood flow changes after ECT, direct effects of (unilateral or bilateral) ECT on seizure propensity, comorbidities, and the reciprocal influences of the concomitant brain pathologies due to psychiatric and other comorbidities. Additional factors potentially controlling outcomes are the impact of ECT electrode placement and stimulation protocol on the function of and connectivity patterns within a network that has already been altered by the comorbid conditions and individual factors that may modify the effects of all these interactions. We commend the authors for reviving these interesting and clinically important questions through their “concept and hypothesis” manuscript prompted by their case report. Despite certain, and often unavoidable, practical limitations, inherent to everyday clinical practice, that prevent definitive conclusions, the implications for future systematic research in this area are important. To date the evidence that kindling occurs in humans is still at best questioned. Time will tell.

Paraphilias, which are characterized by arousal and response to sexual objects or situations that are not part of normative arousal-activity patterns and in varying degrees may interfere with the capacity for reciprocal affectionate sexual activity; 3. Psychosexual dysfunctions, which are characterized by inhibitions in sexual desire or psychophysiologic changes in features of the psychosexual response cycle; and 4.

Forms of neurosis, where the number of symptoms is relatively small, tend to develop what may be called the \"suicidality\" symptom. Selection of the method of therapy depends, not upon the degree and seriousness of the inclination of commit suicide, but upon the underlying disease. In the case of neurotic reactions it is recommended to resort to the method of discussing the respective conflicts and make use of autogenic training. In the case of primary psychic maldevelopments it is necessary to choose a form of therapy centering on the personality, and this can be in the form of short-term specific therapy or in the form of group psychotherapy.",

      "abstract": "Head injury is a major cause of death and disability in young, active population. It may introduce energy through the skin to the deepest structures of the brain. The entered energy may cause direct or primary injury, or result in other, secondary, events to the tissues. These are mechanical loads and are classified as static when the duration of loading is more than 200 ms and dynamic when less than this. The dynamic loads are further classified as impact if the injurious agent has contact with the head or impulsive when the load exerted to other body part/s results in damage to the brain by the change in speed of the head motion. Impact loads can either exert their effect with direct contact to the tissue or may cause inertial loads. The direct contact can cause deformation of the skull or induce energy stress waves to the head and brain. All of these events will result in tissue strain due to compression, tension, or shear. The strain will culminate in injury, which may be a scalp abrasion, laceration, skull fracture, or different kinds of intracranial traumatic lesions.",

It is characterized by behavior and other mental process which involve coercion for occasional or regular use of addiction resources with intention to experience it's effect on mental process or to avoid discomfort due to absence of such a resource (medium). Psychic (mental) addiction is characterized by feeling of satisfaction and will for drug re-consummation to cause comfort and avoid discomfort. Physical addiction is defined as a condition of adjustment on drugs followed by need for increase of dose to achieve its effect as it was in the beginning with smaller quantity and with occurrence of abstinence crisis in absence of drugs. Addiction may be and combination of these two types. Psychic (mental) addiction is close to physical in manifestations (something what human misses) but cause is not (or does not have to be) real, therefore it does not have to be about intoxicated substances (only). Human can be addicted to food, lottery games, television, internet, work, some other human or about anything but common characteristic is that activities connected to addiction may become central content and factor of his/her living. Such different addictions have and different importance, influence and consequences and addiction does not have to be necessarily negative phenomenon although it is mostly considered and judged as such.

      "title": "Poststroke spasticity",
      "abstract": "People who have strokes are subject to numerous potentially devastating sequelae, most often sensorimotor paresis, impairment of cognition and language, and other functional disabilities, including depression and dementia. Of these sequelae, spasticity occurring with motor dysfunction is a frequent finding that has to be evaluated in light of other diagnoses, such as central paresis, ataxia, pathologic stance or gait, and other coordination dysfunctions. Often, spasticity is not notably present in acute ischemic strokes but develops later on, and may then become a major obstacle for achieving independence in performance of activities of daily living (ADLs). Spasticity appearing after a stroke demonstrates quite convincingly that stroke is not a stable condition, but must be viewed instead as a dynamic condition that over time can precipitate additional impairments that were not necessarily noted or present in the acute phase. Poststroke spasticity (PSS) can indeed appear immediately after the ictus, but is most often seen later in the course of the illness. It then becomes a marker of changing or increasing sensorimotor malfunction and therefore requires repeated neurologic assessments. PSS can occur coupled with pain, be noted with decreased dexterity or positioning, or simply be associated with a gradual increase in sensorimotor paresis. When occurring late, PSS can induce changes in the entire health perception of the patient and caregiver. ADLs= : activities of daily living; PSS= : poststroke spasticity The authors thank Allergan, Inc., for supporting travel and meetings of an advisory group that met over the past 3 years to discuss the many issues of poststroke spasticity. It was found that no concise overview exists on this topic that reflects clinical as well as recent research findings. Therefore, this supplement was planned.

      "abstract": "Myoclonus is een frequent voorkomende hyperkinetische bewegingsstoornis die wordt gekenmerkt door spierschokken (positieve myoclonus) en/of het kortdurend wegvallen van de spiertonus (negatieve myoclonus). De klinische presentatie van myoclonus is heel divers. De schokken kunnen in een of meerdere lichaamsdelen optreden of gegeneraliseerd zijn. Myoclonus kan optreden in het gelaat, de nek, romp en de ledematen. Het kan in rust of juist bij actie optreden en wel of niet stimulusgevoelig zijn. Over het algemeen belemmert myoclonus patienten ernstig in hun dagelijks functioneren, zoals bij eten/drinken, schrijven en lopen. Myoclonus heeft vele oorzaken, zowel verworden als genetisch. Voor het vaststellen van de onderliggende oorzaak en het bepalen van de juiste behandeling is het belangrijk myoclonus te herkennen en te onderscheiden van andere bewegingsstoornissen zoals bijvoorbeeld tremor en chorea. Na het herkennen kan myoclonus op basis van een anatomische classificatie worden ingedeeld in subtypes, i.e. naar de plaats in het zenuwstelsel waar de schokken ontstaan. Dit zijn corticale (hersenschors), subcorticale (diepe hersenkernen/hersenstam), spinale (ruggenmerg) en perifere (zenuwen/spieren) myoclonus. Daarnaast kunnen schokken ook een uiting zijn van een functionele (psychogene) stoornis. Door myoclonus naar anatomische classificatie te groeperen kan diagnostiek gericht ingezet worden. Dit proefschrift biedt een nieuw diagnostische aanpak voor patienten met myoclonus. Het beschrijft de uitdagingen en het belang van het nauwkeurig klinisch fenotyperen van zowel motorische als niet-motorische symptomen en de classificatie van het anatomisch myoclonus subtype. Het klinisch neurofysiologisch onderzoek heeft een belangrijke toegevoegde waarde naast de klinische beoordeling in de (sub)classificatie van myoclonus.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Background Delirium is acute onset &amp; fluctuating disturbance in mental state that causes patient appear confused, disoriented or with difficulty to focus and with decline in cognitive function (memory, orientation, speech), circadian disturbance and behavior of patient either agitated or sleepy,in other words sudden confusion. Delirium, also known as acute confusional state, is an organically-caused decline from a previously baseline level of mental function that develops over a short period of time (hours to days). Delirium is not a disease itself, but a syndrome encompassing disturbances in attention, consciousness, and cognition. It may also involve other neurological deficits, like psychomotor disturbances (e.g. hyperactive, hypoactive, or mixed), impaired sleepwake cycle, emotional disturbances, and perceptual disturbances (e.g. hallucinations and delusions). Objective To determine incidence of post-operative delirium in geriatric patients undergoing hip replacement surgery using pre-operative haloperidol. Patients and Methods This study is conducted through geriatric patients undergoing orthopedic surgery and the incidence of pre.&amp; post-operative delirium. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted post-operative surgical ICU in Demerdash hospital which was closed unit and had the same well-established pain, sedation and delirium assessment practices. A delirium was monitored through CAM score in their stay in ICU (max. for &amp;7 days from admission post-operative). Results Several trials stated that the usage of Haloperidol pre-operative decrease the duration and the severity of Delirium rather than the incidence of delirium. In our trial we will detect the incidence of delirium with using prophylactic haloperidol in geriatric patients undergoing Hip replacement surgery. In our study revealed that using prophylactic pre-operative haloperidol decrease the incidence of delirium among geriatric patient as well as decreasing both the duration and the severity of delirium among the study group. Conclusion Our study and results revealed that Haloperidol as antipsychotic drug have beneficial effect on reduction of incidence of delirium in post-operative geriatric patients, also it showed effect on duration of delirium and severity of the disease as well as ICU stay.",

The use and expected performance level of the animal influence how easily exercise intolerance is perceived. Cardiovascular (CV) disease, as well as abnormalities in many other body systems, can underlie exercise intolerance. Several mechanisms, alone or in combination, can interfere with the animal's ability to sustain an optimal activity level. Cardiac disease often limits exercise capacity when the heart is unable to increase forward cardiac output (CO) sufficiently. Abnormal peripheral circulation contributes to inadequate skeletal muscle perfusion and fatigue during exercise. A weak or absent arterial pulse, coolness, pallor, pain, lack of sweating and venous return (horses), muscle contracture, or even paresis might be evident in the pelvic limbs. Ambulatory electrocardiography could uncover contributory arrhythmias, especially during exercise.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a trauma and stress related disorder that may develop after exposure to an event or ordeal in which death, severe physical harm or violence occurred or was threatened.Traumatic events that may trigger PTSD include violent personal assaults, natural or unnatural disasters, accidents, or military combat.(1) People with PTSD continue to have intense, disturbing thoughts and feelings related to their experience that last long after the traumatic event has ended.They may relive the event through flashbacks or nightmares; they may feel sadness, fear or anger; and they may feel detached or estranged from other people.People with PTSD may avoid situations or people that remind them of the traumatic event, and they may have strong negative reactions to something as ordinary as a loud noise or an accidental touch.Enduring personality change after catastrophic experience, also known as EPCACE, is characterized by personality changes after a significant event or events.This condition may be preceded by PTSD.Symptoms may include a distrustful attitude, social isolation, or feeling a sense of threat.(2) Diagnosis Enduring personality change after catastrophic experience is not present in DSM V, unlike ICD X, where it is listed under diagnosis F 62.0.AIM: Aim of this research was to examine prevalence of psychiatric comorbidity and to analyze sociodemographic characteristics in patients with PTSD and enduring personality change after catastrophic experience.",

      "abstract": "Parasomnias are physical, behavioral and experiental phenomena ocurring during entry or along the sleep or on arousal/awakening. The behavior includes movements, emotional, perceptual or dreaming experience, frequently containing manifestations of autonomic nervous system. Parasomnias are devided into primary (ocurring etiher in NREM or REM sleep) and secondary (following organic system disease manifested during sleep). Primary parasomnias are further devided into those that appear during NREM, REM or states of consciousnes that do not respect boundaries between wake and sleep. Parasomnias represent an example of \"dissocitaion of sleep stages\" with the overlaping of wakefulness and NREM sleep (confusional arousals, somnambulism and night terrors) or wake and REM sleep (REM sleep behavior disorder parasomnia). NREM parasomnias are a significant clinical problem that appears with functional reorganization of the brain as it transits throuh different states of consciousness. Aside from the above dissociation there are other physiological phenomena that render behavior more complex during sleep such as 1) activation of locomotor centers during sleep, 2) sleep intertia (confusion and desorientation during transition from sleep to wakefulness) and 3) instability of sleep stages (rapid oscilation(s) between seleep and wake).",

      "title": "Sopite syndrome: a sometimes sole manifestation of motion sickness.",
      "abstract": "Drowsiness is one of the cardinal symptoms of motion sickness; therefore, a symptom-complex centering around \"drowsiness\" has been identified which, for convenience, has been termed the sopite syndrome. Generally, the symptoms characterizing this syndrome are interwoven with other symptoms but under two circumstances the sopite syndrome comprises the main or sole overt manifestation of motion sickness. One circumstance is that in which the intensity of the eliciting stimuli is closely matched to a person's susceptibility, and the sopite syndrome is evoked either before other symptoms of motion sickness appear or in their absence. The second circumstance occurs during prolonged exposure in a motion environment when adaptation results in the disappearance of motion sickness symptoms, except for responses characterizing the sopite syndrome. Typical symptoms of the syndrome are: 1) yawning, 2) drowsiness, 3) disinclination for work, either physical or mental, and 4) lack of participation in group activities. Phenomena derived from an analysis of the symptomatology of the sopite syndrome are qualitatively similar but may differ quantitatively from abstractions derived in other motion sickness responses. One example is the sometimes unique time course of the sopite syndrome. This implies that the immediate eliciting mechanisms not only differ from those involved in evoking other symptoms, but, also, that they must represent first order responses. Diagnosis is difficult unless the syndrome under discussion is kept in mind. Prevention poses a greater problem than treatment.",

If neither of the organs of balance functions the individual will not suffer from carsickness, seasickness, airsickness, nor from cybersickness. - 'Cybersickness' is a form of motion sickness that is stimulated by artificial moving images such as in videogames. Because we are now exposed more often and for longer periods of time to increasingly realistic artificial images, doctors will also encounter cases of motion sickness more often. - The basis for motion sickness is the vestibular system, which can be modulated by visual-vestibular conflicts, i.e. when the movements seen by the eyes are not the same as those experienced by the organs of balance.- Antihistamines can be effective against motion sickness in everyday situations such as car travel if taken before departure, but the effectiveness of medication for motion sickness is limited.",

      "abstract": "Paroxysmal events in childhood are a challenge for pediatric neurologists, given its highly heterogeneous clinical manifestations, often difficult to distinguish between phenomena of epileptic seizure or not. The non-epileptic paroxysmal episodes are neurological phenomena, with motor, sensory symptoms, and/or sensory impairments, with or without involvement of consciousness, epileptic phenomena unrelated, so no electroencephalographic correlative expression between or during episodes. From the clinical point of view can be classified into four groups: motor phenomena, syncope, migraine (and associated conditions) and acute psychiatric symptoms. In this paper we analyze paroxysmal motor phenomena in awake children, dividing them according to their clinical manifestations: extrapyramidal episodes (paroxysmal kinesiogenic, non kinesiogenic and not related to exercise dyskinesias, Dopa responsive dystonia) and similar symptoms of dystonia (Sandifer syndrome); manifestations of startle (hyperekplexia); episodic eye and head movements (benign paroxysmal tonic upward gaze nistagmus deviation); episodic ataxia (familial episodic ataxias, paroxysmal benign vertigo); stereotyped and phenomena of self-gratification; and myoclonic events (benign myoclonus of early infancy). The detection of these syndromes will, in many cases, allow an adequate genetic counseling, initiate a specific treatment and avoid unnecessary additional studies. Molecular studies have demonstrated a real relationship between epileptic and non-epileptic basis of many of these entities and surely the identification of the molecular basis and understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms in many of them allow us, in the near future will benefit our patients. Fenomenos paroxisticos no epilepticos motores en vigilia en la infancia.Los eventos paroxisticos en la infancia son un desafio para los neuropediatras por sus manifestaciones clinicas altamente heterogeneas, muchas veces dificiles de diferenciar entre fenomenos de origen epileptico o no epileptico. Los fenomenos paroxisticos no epilepticos son fenomenos neurologicos, episodicos, con sintomas motores, sensitivos o sensoriales, con o sin afectacion de la conciencia, no relacionados a fenomenos epilepticos, por lo cual no tienen correlato de expresion electroencefalografica entre o durante los episodios. Desde el punto de vista clinico, podemos clasificarlos en cuatro grandes grupos: fenomenos motores, sincopes, migraña (y condiciones asociadas) y cuadros psiquiatricos agudos. En este trabajo se analizan los fenomenos paroxisticos motores en vigilia, dividiendolos de acuerdo a sus manifestaciones clinicas en: episodios extrapiramidales (discinesias paroxisticas cinesiogenicas, no cinesiogenicas y relacionadas con el ejercicio, distonia sensible a levodopa) y cuadros simil distonia (sindrome de Sandifer); manifestaciones de sobresalto (hiperecplexia); movimientos episodicos oculares y cefalicos (desviacion tonica paroxistica de la mirada hacia arriba); ataxia episodica (ataxias episodicas autosomicas familiares y vertigo paroxistico benigno); estereotipias y fenomenos de autogratificacion; y eventos mioclonicos (mioclonias benignas de la infancia temprana). La deteccion de estos sindromes permitira, en muchos casos, realizar un asesoramiento genetico adecuado, instaurar un tratamiento especifico y evitar estudios complementarios innecesarios. Los estudios moleculares han demostrado una relacion entre las bases epilepticas y no epilepticas en muchas de estas entidades. Seguramente la identificacion de los aspectos moleculares y la comprension de los mecanismos fisiopatologicos de muchas de ellas permitiran en un futuro no muy lejano tratamientos especificos que beneficiaran a los pacientes.",

      "abstract": "Background Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is an acquired condition that presents with psychiatric and physical manifestations that carry significant morbidity, with neuropsychiatric complications usually outweighing neuro-physical complications as the major cause of disability after TBI. These complications significantly influence the post-TBI recovery trajectory, inhibiting cognitive and functional rehabilitation, increasing suicide risk and potentially leading to higher mortality rates. Methods We conducted a comprehensive literature review of the epidemiology and global burden of TBI, its types and causes, its underlying mechanisms and pathology, how to assess its severity and the variety of neuropsychiatric sequelae of TBI and their management. Results TBI can trigger a spectrum of neuropsychiatric complications that can range from concussion, post-concussion syndrome and chronic traumatic encephalopathy to emotional disorders (pathological laughing and crying, affective lability and irritability) to cognitive deficits to behavioural disorders (disinhibition, aggression and apathy) and to psychiatric disorders (depression, mania, anxiety, psychosis and sleep disorders). Conclusions Neuropsychiatric sequelae arising from TBI are prevalent, intricate, and often lead to substantial functional and social impairment, requiring a blend of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments. The varied and long-lasting impacts of TBI underlie the necessity for ongoing, tailored management strategies, prevention, early detection, and prompt treatment.",

      "title": "THE EFFECT ON THE STOMACH OF STIMULATION OF THE PERIPHERAL END OF THE VAGUS NERVE",
      "abstract": "Stimulation of the peripheral cut end of either vagus by means of the faradic current will, if the organ be in a state of “hypotonus,” either initiate movements in the quiescent stomach, or, if movements are present, augment and sometimes accelerate them. A rise of entogastric pressure may accompany these movements. The contractions produced are indistinguishable from accentuated normal movements‐they are an exaggeration of the normal‐unless the stimulus be exceptionally strong, when a tonic contraction may result : from this, however, “escape” shortly occurs. The motor effect is preceded by a brief interval or latent period of some three seconds, and should the viscus be initially in a condition of “hypertonus,” this is followed by a period during which movements, if present, cease, and relaxation occurs. Augmented or initial contractions ensue later, but may be delayed until after the cessation of stimulus : there is not necessarily a restoration of entogastric pressure. The pre‐existing state of the peripheral mechanism governs the response to stimulation, the most marked results being obtained with the active organ, the least with the passive. The X‐ray picture on vagal stimulation shows that the effects on function are augmentor and accelerator: food in the cesophagus passes through the cardia, the waves of contraction are deeper than normal, and the pylorus functions rapidly, food leaving through the sphincter before every antral contraction. A brief preliminary relaxation may be observed. These effects remain unchanged by alterations of anæsthetics, decerebration, or splanchnic section. A vaso‐constrictor effect may be obtained on stimulation of the peripheral cut end of the vagus. The first part of the duodenum functions with the stomach and is controlled by the vagus in a similar manner. Stimulation of the intact nerve, the other being undivided, gives variable results, depending on the preexisting state, and on whether the centripetal or centrifugal influences predominate. We desire to make clear that our use of the entogastric pressure is only as an index of the activity or inactivity of the organ, and that by it we are endeavounrng to gauge the condition of the peripheral mechanism. We use the digesting or quiescent viscus in order to obtain variations in this state of the peripheral mechanism, and these are demonstrable by the entogastric pressure, latent period, and “response.” The majority of our findings may be summarised as follows:— 1. The primary effect of stimulation of the peripheral cut end of either vagus on the stomach is dependent on the existing condition of the peripheral mechanism (“tonus”), and may be inhibitor or augmentor. 2. The inhibitor or augmentor effect may involve both “tonus” and movement. 3. The final effect of stimulation is to bring about the augmentation of existing movement or to initiate movement. 4. “Tonus” and contraction may vary inversely or directly.",

      "title": "Gambling Disorder",
      "abstract": "Gambling disorder is characterized by a persistent and recurrent maladaptive pattern of gambling behavior, preoccupation with gambling activities, loss of control, and continued gambling despite problems in social or occupational functioning (Box 62- ). It is associated with significant financial losses, legal problems, and disrupted interpersonal and familial relationships. Individuals with gambling disorder are also at increased risk for suicide attempts (Phillips et al. 1997), new-onset comorbid psychiatric disorders (Kessler et al. 2008), and several medical conditions (Morasco et al. 2006). DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Gambling Disorder 312.31 F63.0 Persistent and recurrent problematic gambling behavior leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, as indicated by the individual exhibiting four (or more) of the following in a 12-month period: Needs to gamble with increasing amounts of money in order to achieve the desired excitement. Is restless or irritable when attempting to cut down or stop gambling. Has made repeated unsuccessful efforts to control, cut back, or stop gambling. Is often preoccupied with gambling (e.g., having persistent thoughts of reliving past gambling experiences, handicapping or planning the next venture, thinking of ways to get money with which to gamble). Often gambles when feeling distressed (e.g., helpless, guilty, anxious, depressed). After losing money gambling, often returns another day to get even (\"chasing\" one's losses). Lies to conceal the extent of involvement with gambling. Has jeopardized or lost a significant relationship, job, or educational or career opportunity because of gambling. Relies on others to provide money to relieve desperate financial situations caused by gambling. The gambling behavior is not better explained by a manic episode . Specify if: Episodic: Meeting diagnostic criteria at more than one time point, with symptoms subsiding between periods of gambling disorder for at least several months. Persistent: Experiencing continuous symptoms, to meet diagnostic criteria for multiple years. Specify if: In early remission: After full criteria for gambling disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for gambling disorder have been met for at least 3 months but for less than 12 months. In sustained remission: After full criteria for gambling disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for gambling disorder have been met during a period of 12 months or longer. Specify current severity: Mild: 4–5 criteria met. Moderate: 6–7 criteria met. Severe: 8–9 criteria met. Despite its serious consequences (Kessler et al. 2008; Petry et al. 2005), gambling disorder is rarely diagnosed and even more rarely treated (Slutske 2006). Less than 10% of individuals with gambling disorder ever seek treatment (Slutske 2006), probably because of a combination of ambivalence about seeking treatment on the part of the patients and limited access for those who wish to seek it. Although some data suggest that many individuals with gambling disorder recover without formal treatment (Hodgins and el-Guebaly 2000; Slutske et al. 2003), there is no available information on the time to remission in natural recovery or the risk of recurrence. Fortunately, despite our limited knowledge about the epidemiology and etiology of gambling disorders, a growing body of literature has examined pharmacological and psychological treatments for gambling disorder.",

Analogously to trigeminal neuralgia, vestibular paroxysmia is diagnosed by the occurrence of short attacks and series of rotational or to-and-fro vertigo, which are precipitated or modulated by changing head position and frequently associated with hypacusis and tinnitus (Brandt and Dieterich 1994a).",

      "abstract": "Emotional Intelligence in Female Children with PTSD After Sexual AbuseC hild abuse is a repeatable early life trauma that is dif- ficult to identify and is one of the strongest risk factors for later emotional psychopathology.Children and adolescents who have a history of childhood abuse have a low level of health-related quality of life, [1] and tend to be more prone to delinquency, posttraumatic stress disorder, and dissociation than those who have not. [2]Also, types of abuse are related to specific psychiatric comorbidity.Sexual abuse is more associated with posttraumatic stress disorder than other kinds of abuse. [3,4]otional intelligence is the ability to recognize the meanings of emotions and their relationships and to use them as a basis for reasoning, problem-solving, and enhancing cognitive activities.Emotional intelligence is comprised of four skills: emotion regulation, emotion recognition in self and others (e.g.reading mind and alexithymia), understanding of emotion, and utilization of emotion to facilitate thinking. [5]Evidence in studies suggests that traumatic experience can rapidly alter brain activation associated with emotional intelligence such as emotion processing. [6]Children with early-life trauma exposure show altered connectivity in brain systems relevant for detecting and processing emotional information and early-life adversity is associated with reorganization of neural circuits in ways that enhance processing of salient emotional stimuli.Altered processing of emotional Objectives: The aim was to investigate the effects of child sexual abuse on emotional intelligence in children with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).Also, there is no study assessing the effects of incest on emotional intelligence in children with PTSD after sexual abuse.The current study aimed to assess the effects of incest on emotional intelligence.Methods: This study included 30 female children with sexual abuse, 20 female traffic accident victims with PTSD, and 25 female healthy volunteers as controls.All participants in the study were assessed with the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) and the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS) and the reading mind from eyes test (RMET) for children.Results: It was found that the TAS-20 total score was significantly higher in the CSA victims than in controls.Difficulty identifying feelings and difficulty describing feelings subscales scores were higher in the incest group.When the groups were compared regarding total DERS scores, it was found that it was found that the DERS total scale was significantly higher in the CSA victims than in controls while no difference was detected between the CSA victims without incest and the incest group.RMET score was significantly lower in the incest group than in the CSA victims without incest.Conclusion: Sexual abuse disrupts emotional processing in female children.It is important to consider the clinical features of emotion processing that could contribute to PTSD treatment in children with sexual abuse.",

      "abstract": "Se trata de una observacion clinica durante un periodo de dos anos de un joven de 21 anos que se presentaba muchas veces en urgencias por una fuerte angustia con importantes trastornos del comportamiento caracterizados por agitaciones psicomotrices, automutilaciones repetidas, amenazas o intentos de homicidio hacia el padre, impulsos frecuentes y a veces conductas antisociales (fugas, estados de peligrosidad). En sus trastornos subyacian muchas veces ideas de persecucion y de referencia. Habia tambien frecuentes intentos de suicidio vinculados con breves periodos depresivos en los que verbalizaba un gran sufrimiento afectivo, que el explicaba esencialmente por dificultades relacionales familiares y por acontecimientos traumaticos (maltrato parental, accidentes). Dos anos despues, el cuadro clinico se agravo con la aparicion de sintomas esquizofrenicos constituidos por un delirio paranoide, alucinaciones con automatismo mental, retraccion social, desorganizacion afectiva y comportamental que se sustituyeron totalmente en sus pasos al acto autoagresivos. Luego se han vuelto mas complejos con la observacion psicoterapica que abre la problematica sexual e identitaria del paciente.La observacion consistio en una escucha atenta durante las entrevistas psicoterapicas regulares que han permitido recorrer la historia evolutiva de esta patologia, al mismo tiempo que su estabilizacion. Nuestro objetivo era despejar una perspectiva clinica y evolutiva que tomara en cuenta la progresion de los sintomas en funcion del tiempo hasta la constitucion de una psicosis propiamente dicha. Limitado por la exploracion neurobiologica (balances, EEG, IRM cerebral) sin resultado aparente, el analisis semiologico de los sintomas del paciente, de sus escritos y de sus simbolos nos ha permitido investigar diferentes fases precoces de la enfermedad, asi como el analisis psicopatologico de sus sintomas.Resultados: Esta experiencia personal nos ha permitido determinar el primer sintoma, conocer el periodo inicial de los trastornos y sus relaciones con los factores de vulnerabilidad (trauma parental y genetico), describir su evolucion segun la edad y reconstituir los sintomas de transicion psicotica. El fin de este articulo es subrayar el papel preventivo de la atencion precoz de los trastornos prepsicoticos. Sin embargo, sigue en pie el interrogante sobre el impacto de la angustia en el desarrollo neuropsiquico del paciente y sobre el origen genetico de la enfermedad. Conclusion: Insistimos en el enfoque preventivo que consiste en detectar los sujetos con riesgos de transicion psicotica y pensar en realizar una psicoterapia adaptada.",

      "title": "Depression in der Rheumatologie",
      "abstract": "Depression is due to a diseased state of a central resonance system controlling our mental and autonomous functions. This regulatory system is essentially involved in communicating with our surroundings. As far as its reactivity is concerned, it can be patterned and programmed with certain behavioural models originating in early childhood. The system is responsible for our feeling tone and can be influenced by both physical disorders and by emotional stress.Depression can result in a fatal spiral depending on the prepatterned tendency to react either more sensitively and vulnerably or more on the aggressive side. Vulnerability is enhanced, the sensitivity to e.g. noise or stress is increased. For example, mothers are apt to be the first persons to complain about the fact that children have become too boisterous, whereas husbands realize that this is symptomatic of a depressive mood.This is followed by a retreat as a kind of protection against enhanced vulnerability, a retreat the relatives fail to understand: ». . . You don't take any interest - you no longer react to what I say; you have ceased to impart stimuli.«After the disturbed approach to aggressivity, the patient shows irritated excitement and enhanced inner tension, inner unrest. This is again interlinked with musculature: the excitement, which has not been sufficiently discharged, leads to muscular tension and eventually to myogeloses and insertion tendopathy.Of course, the human psyche cannot be explained solely by means of chemistry of the brain or by means of amplification systems or any combination of such processes. Hence, depressive and affective disorders cannot be treated on a biochemical basis only. All we can do is to try to understand the subjective side of the patient's experience during his depressive phase, and to help him on the basis of our understanding of this depressive mood. Not only the extent of psychosocial stress and its contribution towards triggering the depression make it mandatory for us to understand the patient's problems; in equal measure, the suffering of the depressed patient who is aware of his condition requires a special approach to his mental disorder. Since depression is made up of physicobiological as well as mental disturbances, pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy must always act jointly.With regard to the complex of depression in rheumatology, therefore, attention must be paid to the following interrelations:1. Depression can be produced in many different ways. A depression can be associated with syndromes of pain in the muscular and skeletal system via cerebral nuclearspecific imbalance through the disturbances in nuclear regions regulating muscular tone. Such syndromes appear chiefly as syndromes of the cervical vertebral column and lumbar vertical column and as general »non-specific pain syndromes«.2. Depressive moods may cause manifestation of rheumatic complaints previously latent due to lowering of the pain threshold.3. Conversely, chronic physical diseases or sudden motor impediments (e.g. in acute and chronic rheumatic diseases) may be assumed to produce depression via common afferent structures.4. Masked depression can assume the pattern of a rheumatic pain syndrome and can be treated as such for a long time purely somatically, i.e. non-specifically (Fig. 6).",

      "abstract": "The complex neuropsychiatric disorder described by Gilles de la Tourette is a childhood onset, generally lifelong condition diagnosed on the basis of multiple, everchanging motor and vocal tics. Genetic evidence indicates that the vulnerability to Tourette's Syndrome (TS) is transmitted as an autosomal dominant genetic trait. This vulnerability has a broad range of expression, from full-blown TS to chronic multiple tics; an alternate manifestation may be obsessive compulsive disorder. There is also a broad range of severity, from quite mild to incapacitating. No specific neuroanatomical or neurochemical basis has yet been discovered, but the basal ganglia and dopaminergic systems have been implicated. Children and adults with TS experience the intrusion into consciousness of unwanted and disturbing sensations, thoughts and desires; they repeatedly experience the need, arising from an \"alien\" force within themselves, to produce sounds and actions which they try to resist but to which they eventually capitulate. Their symptoms elicit strong responses from family and others, as well as themselves. Psychoanalytically guided, clinical study can help illuminate the inner world of individuals with TS and define the pathways between biological vulnerability and clinical expression. Treatment often requires a combination of approaches, including guidance, psychotherapy and, in a minority of cases, the careful use of medication. Over the past decade, TS has served as a model developmental disorder for studying the interactions between biological vulnerability and environmental responses in the emergence of a clinical disorder and in the shaping of a child's character. During the next years, further advances in the study of TS should help clarify basic issues in the transmission of constitutional vulnerability and suggest approaches to prevention and early intervention.",

In fact, unilateral local anaesthesia of the upper dorsal cervical roots induces ataxia and nystagmus in animals, and ataxia without nystagmus in man. Cervical vertigo, if it exists outside these experimental conditions, is obviously characterised by ataxia and unsteadiness of gait rather than by a clear rotational or linear vertigo.",

Some occur spontaneously, others are induced by various external stimuli. In 2001, we described a new clinical entity, which we called tonic reflex seizures of early infancy [1]. The condition occurs in otherwise normal children, mainly boys, and usually during the second or more rarely the third month of life. In all cases described the preganancy and delivery was normal. The attacks consist of tonic contractions predominantly of the limbs provoked by shaking, tactile stimulation or sudden postural changes, whether involving forward, upward or downward movements obviously, such stimuli occur during normal childcare. Upright rhythmical movements appear to be particularly likely to provoke attacks and some mothers are aware of the likely occurrence of the attacks if they descend stairs while holding their child in a vertical position. The attacks themselves consist of a sudden sustained diffuse tonic contraction with extension and abduction of all four limbs,although most noticeable in the upper limbs. This is accompanied by apnea and cyanosis but no impairment of consciousness. Attacks usually last between 3 to 10 sec and are usually followed by a brief cry. They may be repeated if the stimulus is repeated the phenomenon",

      "abstract": "Abstract Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is characterized by obsessions and/or compulsions that are time-consuming or cause clinically significant distress or impairment in functioning. Obsessions are recurrent and persistent intrusive, unwanted thoughts, urges, or images that cause marked anxiety or distress. Examples of obsessions include worrying about germs, the feeling things need to be “just right,” worrying about bad things happening, and disturbing thoughts or images about hurting others. Compulsions are repetitive behaviors or mental acts that an individual feels compelled to perform in response to an obsession or according to rules that must be applied rigidly. Examples of compulsions include washing, checking, tapping, ordering, and repeating. Young children may not be able to articulate the aims of these repetitive behaviors or mental acts. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the first-line class of medications used to treat OCD in children and adolescents. Exposure and response prevention (ERP) therapy is the gold standard psychotherapy treatment for OCD.",

      "title": "[Cognitive and behavioral consequences of epilepsy during the course of brain development].",
      "abstract": "The notion that cognitive and behavioural dysfunctions of epileptic origin can be prolonged and with an insidious onset, has meant a radical conceptual change about epilepsy considered so far uniquely as a paroxysmal disorder. Also, these dysfunctions can be the only observable manifestations of the disorder. It is particularly true in some epileptic syndromes with onset in childhood. Epileptic dysfunctions are characterized by a discontinuity in time (intermittent, recurrent), in space (cerebral localization of the dysfunction and its spread). They often have a significant relationship with sleep. These features, with sometimes the existential dimension of some symptoms (intermittent loss of the flux of consciousness, intermittent perceptual distortions or cognitive-emotional dysfunction) are not seen in any other congenital or acquired disorders of the human brain. Longitudinal clinical studies in which the epileptic variable can be directly correlated with the precise study of the cognitive dysfunction (also with increasingly complex methods of brain imaging) are a difficult, relatively new multidisciplinary task, especially in the very young child. Case examples of children followed from early childhood to adulthood will illustrate the diversity of observed cognitive and behavioural abnormalities directly caused by the epileptic activity which can be massive or very discrete. One is only beginning to document precisely the late consequences (or absence of) of some early childhood epilepsies that had a direct impact on developing brain function at some point.",

From a biological viewpoint, chronic fear and activation of glucocorticoids are metabolically costly. The physiological effects of traumatic brain injury (TBI) may elicit posttraumatic stress disorder, the physiological characteristics of which may be in the opposite direction to those of TBI. Somatic injury occurring in the concussive accident may be the most important consideration affecting status and outcome. Chronic stress impairs the process of wound healing, attributable to proinflammatory. Stress reduces the immune response, and reduces the proliferation and activity of various types of cells. Prolonged somatic activity related to injury, stress, pain; stress reactions to chronic pain and impairment; and unhappiness all result in neuroendocrine imbalances. Physiological dysfunctions contribute to neurobehavioral dysfunctioning that can be misattributed to cerebral injury, faking or secondary gain, if the practitioner does not consider the effects of an injury.",

      "title": "Abuse and Maltreatment: Their Effect on Headache",
      "abstract": "Research has shown that sexual, physical, and especially emotional abuse create a predisposition to headache. Individuals with migraine may have experienced abuse in early life. Childhood maltreatment is associated with an earlier onset of migraine and a tendency for episodic migraine eventually to become chronic. How Would You Define Abuse? Physical abuse includes slapping, hitting, kicking, striking, pinching or pushing another. Emotional abuse includes neglect, threats, harassment, controlling behavior, attempts to isolate, and bullying. Sexual abuse is any nonconsensual sexual activity. For children and adolescents, it also includes any sexual activity with an older individual, whether consensual or not. Tell your Physician About Your Abuse In assessing your health concerns and planning your course of care, it is beneficial for your health-care provider to know if you are currently being abused, feel in danger of being abused, or have been abused in the distant past. If the topic of abuse is not openly addressed, the consequences can include failure of medical treatment and a continued cycle of abuse and poor physical and emotional health. Is the History of Abuse Important Even if it Occurred as a Child? As it may be linked to many medical and psychological problems, early abuse is indeed important. Significant stress occurring early in life may lead to an exaggerated response to stress later in life. For some, stress is the most important trigger for migraine. Migraine may also be aggravated by the depression and anxiety that so often follow abuse. What If I Am Currently Being Abused? Your health-care providers can guide you to resources offering psychological support and, when needed, personal safety. A sampling of the resources available is listed in the following. If you are currently in danger, ask for help. Place these calls from a phone where you will safe from your abuser. If your children are being abused, inform your health-care team so that this can be reported to the authorities. How Can I Best Deal With My Abuse? If you attempt to “forget” about prior abuse or deny that it ever happened, you are not dealing with the problem, but rather ignoring it. Talking to a counselor, speaking to an abuse advocate, or calling an abuse hotline may help you deal cope more effectively. From a perspective of treating your headache, therapies that help with stress management may be beneficial. Are Resources Available?

Depression can seriously impact a child’s academic achievement, social interactions and other aspects of their daily lives. [1] The reported prevalence of depression is 1 to 2% in prepubescent children, 3 to 8% in younger teenagers and 14% in teenagers aged 15 to 18; overall, it is estimated that 20% of the population will experience at least one episode of depression prior to the age of 18. [2] During childhood there is no significant gender difference in the prevalence of depression, but after puberty female rates of depression become higher than those for males. [3] The etiology of childhood depression remains unclear: it may be caused by the interaction of various risk factors and protective factors including genetic predisposition, abnormalities of the structure and function of the brain, psychological and physiological stressors, poor parental relationships, and so forth.

      "title": "Pain Is An Uncomfortable Sensation",
      "abstract": "Pain is an uncomfortable sensation that indicates that the body is damaged or threatened with injury. Pain starts at special pain receptors that are found all over the body. These pain receptors transmit messages as electrical impulses along nerves to the spinal cord and then upward to the brain. Sometimes the signal when it reaches the spinal cord elicits a reflex response. When this happens, the signal is immediately sent back by the motor nerve to the site of pain, encouraging the muscles to tighten. An example of a reflex reaction is an immediate withdrawal reaction after something very hot is inadvertently touched. The pain signal is also transmitted to the brain. Only when the brain processes the signal and perceives it as pain does the person become aware of it. Pain felt in some areas of the body does not have to indicate exactly where the problem is, because the pain can be transferred to another area. Transmitted pain occurs because signals from several areas of the body often go to the spinal cord and brain through the same nerve pathways. The ability to endure pain varies with mood, personality, and conditions. Pain can change greatly with age. As people get older, they complain less about pain, perhaps because changes in the body reduce the sensation of pain. On the other hand, older people may simply be more stoic than younger people.",

      "title": "Concussion and mild head injury",
      "abstract": "A concussion is a physical injury to the head resulting in altered mental function, with expectation of recovery within 2–3 weeks. In a significant minority of cases the symptoms persist longer, thereby comprising a symptom complex commonly referred to as the “post concussion syndrome”, that is, one or more somatic (for example, headaches, dizziness), cognitive (for example, poor concentration, memory), or behavioural/affective (for example, irritability, mood swings) symptoms. Unfortunately, the referral of a patient with the possibility of post concussion syndrome to a busy neurology outpatient clinic can precipitate an inward sigh of reluctant resignation in even the most diligent neurologist or neurosurgeon. We know we are in for a potentially lengthy consultation—long on symptoms and short on signs. Moreover, the process can be convoluted and meandering, as unrewarding for the patient as it is unsatisfying for the clinician.\n\nIt is important to acknowledge at the outset that there is a dearth of evidence-based knowledge of the underlying pathogenesis, and even less of the best management of post concussive symptoms. Thus, much of the information and advice in this article is empirical and based on expert and personal experience.\n\nThe terminology surrounding trauma to the head confuses patients, doctors, and lay commentators alike. Terms such as concussion, mild head injury, mild TBI (traumatic brain injury), cerebral concussion, and post concussion syndrome are often used interchangeably to describe the physical injury itself as well as its immediate and later symptomatic consequences. There is in fact no commonly agreed definition of concussion, or whether it even differs from the term mild TBI. Our own working definition is that concussion is an acute trauma-induced change of mental function which generally lasts less than 24 hours (with or without preceding loss of consciousness) and associated with other symptoms (such as headaches and dizziness) which …",

      "abstract": "The prodomal phase of schizophrenia is characterised by changes in behaviour, mood, cognitive functioning and possibly neurobiological and neurocognitive changes. Symptom improvement following psychotic illness is not always matched by functional recovery, and remains disabling and problematic for the individual and his/her family. Social roles and goals and employment are often affected by psychosis. Strategic healthcare guidance recommends the provision of educational, vocational and social recovery following first episode psychosis. Offering activity as a platform to re-engage in mainstream activities, leisure pursuits and vocational activities provides opportunities to overcome stigma, re-build self-esteem and aid recovery from first episode psychosis. Activity should be offered as a core intervention in the rehabilitation of individuals following first episode psychosis.",

In spite of the implicitly wrong conception of reality, the significance of these delusions as an attempt to express, interpret and cope with mental illness should not be neglected if an approach to the patient's own experience is sought. On the one hand, hypochondriacal delusions are based on altered body perceptions in mental illness, characterized by primary local or general dysaesthesias to the point of depersonalisation, or caused secondarily by the patient's increased attention to his own body. This alienated bodily experience is named in (lay) medical terms by the delusional hypochondriac. On the other hand, \"illness\" with its manifold cultural and psychological meanings stands as a polyvalent metaphor for the incomprehensible alteration of the patient's self-experience in general: thus, the feeling of exposure to external attacks, of guilt, sinfulness, shame, loss of self-esteem or even the experience of a disruption of personality may find their expression in the hypochondriacal delusion.",

Some neurological conditions characterized by movement disorders that start or persist during sleep hinder sleep onset and/or sleep continuity, causing a poor sleep complaint. CNS lesions and/or dysfunction in three specific neurological conditions (fatal familial insomnia, Morvan's chorea, and delirium tremens) impair the basic mechanisms of sleep generation inducing a syndrome in which the inability to sleep is consistently associated with motor and sympathergic overactivation.

People with ADHD usually experience the following types of symptoms: (1) Attention means a person may have difficulty staying on task, sustaining focus, and staying organized, and appear not to listen, even when spoken to directly. (2) Hyperactivity means a person may seem to move about constantly, including in situations when it is not appropriate or excessively fidgets, taps, or talks. They may often be on the go, in constant motion, and have trouble playing or doing an activity quietly. (3) Impulsivity means a person may act without thinking or have difficulty with self-control. Impulsive behavior also occurs when their desire for reward is not satisfied or temporarily put on hold. An impulsive person may interrupt others or make important decisions without considering long-term consequences. Those people’s behaviors are more severe, occur more often, and interfere with or reduce the quality of how they function socially at school or in professional life.",

      "title": "The positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia reflect impairments in the perception and initiation of action",
      "abstract": "Synopsis The CNS maintains a fundamental distinction between actions elicited by external stimuli and actions elicited by internal goals (acts of will). As a result the intact organism can monitor centrally three aspects of its own actions: (1) the action appropriate to current external stimulation (stimulus intention or meaning); (2) the action appropriate to current goals (willed intention); and (3) the action which was actually selected (corollary discharge). In Type I (acute) schizophrenic patients, intentions of will lead to actions, but these willed intentions are not monitored correctly. This apparent discrepancy between will and action gives rise to experiential (1st rank) positive symptoms (e.g. delusions of control and passivity). In Type II (chronic) patients, intentions of will are no longer properly formed and so actions are rarely elicited via this route. This gives rise to behavioural negative signs (e.g. poverty of speech). The behaviour of Type II schizophrenics has surface similarities to that shown by patients with Parkinson's disease and patients with frontal lobe lesions in that all three types of patient show a relative deficit of actions elicited by willed intentions. Dopamine blocking drugs reduce positive symptoms in Type I patients precisely because they induce Parkinsonism, i.e. reduce the likelihood of actions being initiated by willed intentions. This in turn reduces the likelihood that actions will occur for which the patient had no awareness of his intention to act.",

OCD is a highly disabling and common disorder, characterised by obsessions and compulsions, such as unwanted doubts, sexual or aggressive thoughts, concerns regarding symmetry, or contamination concerns. Neurodevelopmentally, frontal-striatal regions have been strongly implicated, with evidence to suggest the involvement of specific neurological circuitry, and robust evidence of resulting neuropsychological changes, albeit of a moderate magnitude. The dominant view of serotonergic dysfunction in OCD is that it arises from hypersensitivity of postsynaptic serotonin receptors, perhaps stemming from serotonin transporter and receptor genetic abnormalities. OCD is not to be confused with the similarly-named Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorder (OCPD). OCPD is a personality disorder characterised by perfectionism that interferes with task completion, dedication to work to the exclusion of leisure, rigidity and stubbornness, hypermorality and scrupulosity, over-attention to detail, miserliness, an inability to discard worn or useless items and an inability to delegate tasks.",

There are other common features of addictive substances or activities which may explain their addictive potential: they act as operant reinforcers and as Pavlovian unconditioned stimuli, tolerance develops, an initial positive mood is followed by dysphoria and addictions are stimulated by common states (arousal, stress, pain). Most of Marks' features are not unique to addictions but apply to primary drive states (normal eating, sleeping, elimination, sex) and many apply to normal goal‐orientated behaviour. Normal repetitive behaviour is more flexible than addictive behaviour, in allowing satisfactory substitution of alternatives. The restrictive range of activities which are satisfactory for the addict suggest that building up the behavioural repertoire may help in prevention and rehabilitation. Tics and Tourettes syndrome should not be regarded as addictions, since they involve simple, involuntary and non‐goal‐directed behavioural sequences. Considering addictions as goal‐directed is important: addicts are often ambivalent about whether they want to give up or continue. This often underlies dropout and relapse. Treatment must address this issue.",

Is it beneficial, at least to avoid muscle deconditioning, or detrimental, even harmful, because of the mechanical stress imposed to wrecked myofibres?\n\nAn initial consideration is that little attention has been given to the different responses to training that the various myopathic conditions can produce. A second, consequential one, is that lack of unequivocal results and flaws in the training protocols let physicians take a somewhat empirical attitude—dictated by personal inclinations, common sense, indulgence toward patient compliance or just prudence inspired by ‘ primum non nocere - first do not harm’, an old evergreen precept (Hippocrates, 460–377 BC). In many cases, the final persuasion is that physical exercise is not recommended, through anxiety over the risk of damaging an already compromised muscle, or even triggering acute episodes of pain, rhabdomyolysis and myoglobinuria. The latter are certainly contraindications to strenuous physical exercise, for instance in several metabolic myopathies related to impaired energy metabolism, such as the lipid storage myopathies, due to defects of intra-mitochondrial transport and utilization of fatty acids (Bruno and DiMauro, 2008; e.g. carnitine-palmitoyl transferase II deficiency, electron transfer flavoprotein dehydrogenase (ETF-DH) deficiency, and very long-chain fatty acid β-oxidation defects) or glycogen (DiMauro, 2007; e.g. myophosphorylase deficiency and defects of intermediary glycolytic enzymes). Some defects of the mitochondrial respiratory chain are also associated with myoglobinuria, notably deficiency of CoQ10 (especially related to ETF-DH deficiency) and mutations in the MTCOB gene (Andreu et al. , 1999), but in most cases neither high creatine kinase nor myoglobinuric episodes are frequent symptoms of mitochondrial disorders.\n\nIn addition, little, if any, attention is paid to the quantitative and qualitative features of therapeutic physical training (van der Kooi …",

      "title": "Primary Dystonias",
      "abstract": "Dystonia is defined as sustained muscle contractions, frequently causing twisting and repetitive movements, or abnormal postures. Classification of dystonia is based on three axes describing, for each patient, age at disease onset (early vs. adult), distribution of involved body sites (from focal to generalised), and aetiology (primary dystonia syndromes, heredodegenerative or symptomatic dystonias). Primary dystonias are further subdivided into primary pure (with dystonia only), primary plus (with other associated movement disorders) and primary paroxysmal forms (characterised by intermittent symptoms). Dystonia encompasses a combination of movements and postures to generate sustained muscle contractions, repetitive twisting movements and abnormal postures (torsion dystonia). In dystonic movements speed of contractions may be slow or rapid, but at the peak of movement it is sustained and movements have a consistent directional or posture-assuming character. Dystonia has some unique activation/deactivation features: gestes antagonistes (or sensory tricks), mirroring, and overflow. It has been shown that both genetic predisposition and environmental factors play a significant role in the aetiology of primary dystonia syndromes. Genetic defects are known only for a minority of cases presenting with pure dystonia (such as for DYT1 or DYT6 dystonias), by contrast, dystonia plus syndromes (dopa responsive dystonia, myoclonus dystonia and rapid onset dystonia parkinsonism) are caused by known genotypes. There is no aetiologic or neuroprotective treatment for primary pure dystonia syndromes. Etiologic remedies are instead available for some dystonia plus syndromes of metabolic origin, such as for dopa responsive dystonia. Symptomatic treatments aim to relieve involuntary movements, correct abnormal posture, prevent contractures, reduce pain and embarrassment, and improve function. Botulinum toxin is the first choice treatment for most types of focal dystonia. Neurosurgical treatments have a growing role in the symptomatic treatment plan, because long-term electrical stimulation of the globus pallidum internum is now established as an effective treatment for primary generalised or segmental dystonias.",

A wide range of other genetic and environmental conditions that interfere with normal basal ganglia developmental processes can produce a clinical syndrome that we call the developmental basal ganglia syndrome (DBGS), and which closely resembles TS. Failure to distinguish TS from other causes of DBGS has probably hampered research efforts aimed at clarifying the neurobiological mechanisms, localizing the genetic defect, assessing therapy, and establishing accurate prevalence rates for TS.",

One 13-year-old subject with male sex has the symptom, where the subject's behavior resembles autistic behavior such as being very hyperactive, experiencing tantrums (biting his own hand or throwing things if his desire is not fulfilled), losing language skills and speech, ability to intertwine poor social interaction, as well as developmental deterioration or abnormality after experiencing the normal phase at the age of two years, followed by a real loss of trained skills. The method used for children who have disintegration syndrome is by motion therapy with the aim that the subject can maximize concentration and focus in order to be able to survive in an activity or activity and be able to use fine and rough motor skills with flexibility. The result of this therapy is that there is a slight change from the previous behavior, namely an increase in concentration behavior, eye contact becomes longer than usual and is not easily tantrum and more obedient.",

      "abstract": "Objective and Method: This paper describes the overlap between reactive (psychogenic) psychosis and other brief psychotic episodes, and explores the gradual disappearance of reactive psychoses as a distinct nosological entity from international classifications. Clinical and conceptual issues concerning reactive psychosis are examined on the basis of a critical review of major classical and modern papers. A brief illustrative case history is also provided. Results: Reactive psychoses are conceptualised as severe disturbances of mental state, on occasion chameleon-like in their shifting form and content, arising in response to a stressful event or life situation. Reactive psychoses have an abrupt onset and usually run their course to complete resolution in a matter of days or weeks. Precipitants include overwhelming fear, threat of imminent destruction, social isolation (as can occur with imprisonment, immigration or deafness), bereavement and intense sexual or interpersonal conflicts. The emergence of a reactive psychosis usually occurs against the background of a predisposing vulnerability in terms of personality disorder, organic impairment, or a history of sensitising experiences, occasionally operating in combination. Conclusions: The increasing failure to recognise reactive psychoses diminishes clinical psychiatry because it removes an important opportunity for understanding mental disorder in terms of an integration, and totalisation, of developmental history, psychological makeup, social context and current realities, and in so doing lessens our awareness of the links between psychosis and our common humanity.",

The notion of confusional arousals in children has received less attention overall compared with that concerning adults. The impression gained in adults is that, especially in response to forced awakenings, the behavioral disturbance in adult episodes is more forceful, vigorous and resistive, sometimes leading to violent behavior. Childhood confusional arousals do not usually require treatment, only advice to parents that they can be considered to be a passing phase. The same cannot necessarily be said of confusional arousals in adult life when they have more of a tendency to persist, depending on their etiology and relationship to other sleep disorders.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Background Behavioural interventions conceptualise self‐injurious behaviour (SIB) as developing from early repetitive behaviours through acquisition of homeostatic functions in regulating stimulation and subsequent shaping into SIB through socially mediated or automatic operant reinforcement. Despite high success rates, such interventions rarely completely eliminate SIB, and overall effectiveness has not increased since the 1960s. Methods Research (excluding studies of single genetic syndromes) on the early development, functional properties and phenomenology of SIB in persons with intellectual disabilities (IDs) published from 1999 to 2010 inclusive is reviewed. Results Despite evidence to support the operant shaping hypothesis, in some cases tissue‐damaging SIB, especially head‐banging, emerges at a similar or younger age than stereotyped behaviours or ‘proto‐SIB’, often associated with tantrums following frustrative non‐reward and/or abrupt situational transitions. Many young children show undifferentiated patterns of responding in functional analyses of SIB, and SIB is associated with aggression and impulsivity as well as with repetitive behaviour. Conclusions One dynamic in the development of SIB may be Pavlovian conditioning of aggression, originally elicited by aversive events or frustrative non‐reward, to stimuli associated with such situations. Integration into operant technology of interventions based on Pavlovian principles such as graduated exposure (with or without counterconditioning) to aversive stimuli may enhance the effectiveness of behavioural interventions.",

      "abstract": "Structural damage of the human brain (perinatal damage, cerebral trauma, head injury, cerebrovascular and degenerative diseases, intracranial tumor, metabolic diseases, toxins, drug-induced seizures) may lead to chronic epilepsy in survivors. Epidemiologic analyses show that a considerable time-delay occurs between the exposure of the brain to injury and the appearance of seizures. Such seizures are usually partial or mixed, may develop at any age, and are difficult to treat. In rats subjected to structural damage of the brain induced by sustained convulsions triggered by systemic administration of the cholinergic agent pilocarpine, spontaneous seizures may develop after a mean latency of 14-15 days. The mean frequency of spontaneous recurrent convulsions remains constant for several months. Evolution of these convulsions proceeds through several electrographic and behavioral stages resembling kindling. Kindling may be otherwise induced in rodents by repeated systemic administration of convulsants or by repeated electrical stimulation of sensitive brain regions. These observations demonstrate that structural damage of the brain may lead to spontaneously recurrent convulsions (chronic epilepsy) in rats and that kindling may be involved in the evolution of such a condition. This finding suggests that kindling mechanisms underlie the development of epileptic foci from structural brain lesions. Such mechanisms may be involved in the etiology of some forms of epilepsy in humans.",

Chorea is seen in association with various medical diseases such as cerebrovascular diseases (hemichorea), autoimmune diseases like Sydenham chorea, thyrotoxicosis, pregnancy, drug intoxication, and hereditary disorders like Huntington disease, neuroacanthocytosis, and dentato-rubro-pallido-luysian atrophy (DRPLA). Treatment with D<sub>2</sub>-blockers is effective in some cases. Ballism entailsgross violent movements of extremities that look like throwing or kicking. It is commonly caused by a vascular lesion of the subthalamic nucleus or striatum and thus involves contralateral upper and lower limbs (hemiballism). Vigorous muscle contractions irregularly involve the shoulder and pelvic girdles and the proximal limbs. In the chronic stage, each movement becomes less violent and resembles chorea, although it still involves primarily the proximal muscles. Ballism usually responds to medication with diazepam or D<sub>2</sub>-blockers like haloperidol.",

      "abstract": "Childhood Cerebral Palsy – the group of diseases concerned with motor disorders as the result of brain damage or dysfunction of certain brain centers – is usually acquired during the first years of life, at the time when the system of primary movement patterns is developing. Primary movements are genetically programmed for protection and survival, and also for the development of the conscious movement system. Developmentally their role is to support: - maturation of the nervous system (synaptogenesis, myelination, and brain plasticity) - brain function (cognitive development, emotional maturation) - sensory-motor integration. Dysfunctions of motor development and sensory-motor integration in the child with CP are a reflection of the type of neurological insult and the developmental stage of the infant/child when the neurological insult occurred. The developmental stages can be divided into prenatal (in utero); natal (during the birth process); or postnatal (after birth but during the first years of life). Each developmental stage is vulnerable to specific neurological insults. Prenatal palsy can be caused by infection, toxicity in the fetus, or compromised health in the pregnant mother. Some primary motor patterns and reflexes, such as Trunk Extension, Automatic Gait, Grasp, Swallowing and Sucking develop in utero. Prenatal brain damage will cause poor expression of these reflexes and adversely impact the next stage of development. Natal palsy is generally caused by neurological insult during birth: a consequence of premature birth, sudden deliveries, narrow pelvis of the mother, use of forceps during birth, etc. Natal trauma can negatively affect the activation of primary motor patterns and reflexes characteristic of a normal successful birth. In such cases the expression of these genetic programs will be abnormal. The primary movements and reflexes of childbirth, such as Head Righting, Perez, Tonic Labyrinthine (TLR) in extension, Bauer Crawling, Sequential Side Rotation, Spinning, and Sucking may be dysfunctional. Postnatal palsy is often caused by an infection with encephalitic symptoms. Other causes include childhood cranial injury, central nervous system injury, and poor systemic health. Infant motor patterns and reflexes will be stressed by postnatal CP, and may develop dysfunctionally or pathologically. Dynamic reflexes (e.g., Grasp, Hands Pulling, Automatic Gait, Sequential Side Rotation, Spinning); positional reflexes (e.g., Asymmetrical Tonic Neck Reflex [ATNR] Symmetrical Tonic Neck Reflex [STNR], Babkin Palmomental, Tonic Labyrinthine Reflex",

      "abstract": "Introduction Impulsivity and compulsivity are natural behaviors controlled by brain mechanisms that are essential for survival in all species. Understanding these brain mechanisms may lead to targeted treatment strategies for these symptom domains when impulsivity and compulsivity become dysfunctional. Pathological impulsivity and compulsivity characterise a broad range of mental disorders. Objectives This study aimed to synthesise the latest evidence about the conceptualization of the impulsivity-compulsivity spectrum. Methods A review was conducted, drawing on reputable sources (PubMed and Web of Science databases). Results The concept of impulsivity can be defined as a predisposition toward rapid, unplanned reactions to internal or external stimuli without regard to the negative consequences of these reactions to the impulsive individual or to others. However, impulsivity is not always unplanned. Impulsive behaviours can be conceptualised as the core symptoms of a broad range of psychiatric disorders. In contrast, compulsivity refers to repetitive behaviours that are performed according to certain rules or in a stereotypical fashion. Compulsivity is a tendency to repeat the same, often purposeless acts, which are sometimes associated with undesirable consequences. Impulsivity and compulsivity may be viewed as diametrically opposed, or alternatively, as similar, in that each implies a dysfunction of impulse control. Each involves alterations within a wide range of neural processes, including attention, perception, and coordination of motor or cognitive responses. Conclusions The neurobiology of impulsivity and compulsivity may involve inhibitory neurotransmitters, excitatory neurotransmitters, the prefrontal cortex, and/or limbic dysfunction. Impulsive and compulsive features may present at the same time or at different times during the same illness. Although both compulsive and impulsive disorders may be related to prefrontal cortex dysfunction, compulsive disorders would be related to hyperactivity and impulsive disorders to hypoactivity of the prefrontal cortex. Compulsiveness appears to be associated with increased frontal lobe activity, while impulsiveness may be associated with reduced frontal lobe activity. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

      "abstract": "The motivation that drives addiction (severe substance use disorders) is best understood as primary, not derivative of other, commonly experienced motivations -- though addiction often begins with other motivations. The term, “sui generis,” emphasizes this. Addiction involves an intense focus on using, with a motivational salience to use frequently, and to engage in associated behavior, cognition, and conation -- to the point that it takes over the user’s life, superceding common sense, reasonable judgment, and acceptable behavior. Addiction is usually accompanied by physical dependence, but is not the same thing: that is, using to avoid withdrawal is not the same as using to gratify addictive craving. But physical dependence or other motivations may appear as “pseudo-addiction.” Addictive craving is not a psychological derivative of other motivations (though an addict will say otherwise). In its pathogenesis, occasional alcohol or drug use becomes routine. Then, regular use becomes a turning point for many, toward addiction.",

They may be classified as dysfunctions associated with transitions into sleep, partial arousals during sleep, or following arousals from sleep (2,3). Parasomnias can be categorized either as primary or secondary. Transitional parasomnias typically occur during wake-to-sleep transitions and can persist into N1 (Stage 1) sleep. Primary parasomnias can be subdivided by the sleep from which they appear, e.g., rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, non-REM (NREM) sleep, or both. Secondary parasomnias are more commonly associated with other organ system dysfunction and manifest symptoms during the sleep period.",

      "title": "Orthorexia nervosa – a different lifestyle or a specific eating disorder?",
      "abstract": "Orthorexia nervosa (ON) is considered an obsession with healthy eating, a phenomenon that includes excessive dietary restrictions, which in turn can lead to metabolic dysfunctions. Although the nosological status of this pathology is currently insufficiently determined, ON attracts the interest of mental health specialists due to the possible harmful psychological and biological consequences, its high prevalence in the general population and the difficulty of adequate therapeutic management (low level of insight and lack of evidence-based treatments). Orthorexia nervosa should be distinguished from other mental disorders with which it has a high degree of clinical overlap (obsessive-compulsive disorder, anorexia nervosa, restrictive/avoidant eating disorder etc.), but also from “healthy orthorexia” (this being considered part of a lifestyle focused on eliminating foods labeled as “impure”, “toxic” or “artificial”). The analysis of risk factors for ON highlights the importance of several obsessive-compulsive personality traits (perfectionism, rigidity, self-control), executive dysfunctions, internalization of social models (thinness or perfect health, for example), media pressure, parental and social group influences, belonging to certain professional categories (nutritionists, medical students, athletes) or practicing yoga. Several psychometric instruments for measuring the severity of ON have been developed over the last two decades, but they should be used with caution because not all of them have well-established validity. Also, several sets of diagnostic criteria have been proposed in order to identify the clinical features of orthorexia nervosa and to differentiate these patients from those diagnosed with anorexia nervosa, obsessive-compulsive disorder, somatoform disorders or nonpathological orthorexic behaviors. Finally, some therapeutic suggestions are presented, mainly psychotherapies, but it should be mentioned that they are based on case studies or on the extrapolation of data from trials dedicated to pathologies considered to be related to orthorexia nervosa. In conclusion, because ON is a nosological entity that has only recently been cornered, there is an urgent need to explore psychometric tools with higher specificity and to find more widely accepted diagnostic criteria. Also, no clear, evidence-based therapeutic recommendations could yet be formulated, because no clinical trial focused on the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions in patients with orthorexia nervosa has been conducted.",

      "abstract": "Autism is a complex developmental disability that typically appears during the first three years of life and is usually diagnosed between the ages of two and three years (2-4). The term autism refers to not one disorder but a group of disorders known as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). ASD is described as impairment in one or more of the following three categories: reciprocal social interaction, communication, and specific pattern of behaviors, interest, and activities. For any of these impairments, the child has the potential to display distressed behaviors (5). Distressed behaviors can include verbal outburst, self stimulatory behaviors, aggression, etc. and various other behaviors of concerns. Distressed behaviors, such as hand flapping, appear to form a functional response to stimuli this response often negatively impacts others. These behaviors are more likely among persons who are receiving aversive stimulation, such as having to engage in non preferred academic task. (5). Of concern in this paper is can the use of physical activity decrease distressed behavior. The literature demonstrates that increasing physical activity can has also demonstrated decreased distressed behaviors; unfortunately physical education programs have been decreasing in many public schools (11). Along with academic and behavioral benefits, there is a well established link between physical activity and positive health outcomes. A large part of this risk is associated with physical inactivity. The majority of literature regarding physical activity involves children who are typically developing. This study will apply these findings to a student with Autism. This research will introduce three ten minute bouts of noncontingent physical activity per day will decrease distressed behavior and increase time-on-task. A single subject design was utilized to observe a student with autism in a classroom setting. It was hypothesized that a correlation exists between physical activity, distressed behavior, and time-on-task. During this study a wealth of data were collected regarding the impact of physical activity on distressed behaviors and time-on-task. The Fischer exact probability test was significance (p =.025); from base line through intervention the subject decreased the number of disruptive behaviors. This study demonstrated that physical activity should be implemented amongst students with Autism to decrease distressed behaviors for a single subject.",

      "abstract": "An epileptic seizure is a “transient occurrence of signs and/or symptoms due to abnormal excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain.” Epilepsy is a disorder of the brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures and by the neurobiological, cognitive, psychological, and social consequences of this condition. The widely accepted operational definition of epilepsy requires that an individual have at least two unprovoked seizures on separate days, generally 24 hours apart. An unprovoked seizure refers to a seizure that occurs in the absence of an acute brain insult or systemic disorder. This nosology is based on the observation that while a single unprovoked seizure is often an isolated event that does not recur during an individual’s lifetime, two unprovoked seizures rarely occur in isolation and are associated with high risk of the individual experiencing more seizures. In some cases, such as when the seizure occurs in the setting of a potentially epileptogenic brain insult such as an episode of encephalitis or a traumatic brain injury (TBI), it is possible to recognize the specific form of epilepsy at its earliest presentation. In such cases, the diagnosis of epilepsy can be made after the very first unprovoked seizure. Based on its definition, epilepsy is not a single disorder but rather a syndrome or syndromes. Different forms of epilepsy syndrome(s) have different causes, different manifestations, different implications for short- and longterm management and treatment, and different outcomes.",

      "title": "La Realidad Virtual como Herramienta Terapéutica en Niños con TDAH",
      "abstract": "La Realidad Virtual como Herramienta Terapéutica en Niños con TDAH&#x0D; &#x0D; El TDAH es una trastorno neurobiológico descrito como un patrón continuo de inatención y/o hiperactividad-impulsividad que impide al niño realizar las actividades diarias. Los niños con TDAH también pueden experimentar dificultades para mantener la atención, la función ejecutiva (habilidad del cerebro para comenzar una actividad, organizarse y llevar a cabo tareas) y la memoria de trabajo (aquella que permite mantener la información temporalmente y manipularla durante un periodo corto de tiempo). &#x0D; &#x0D; &#x0D; Los niños con TDAH presentan multiples síntomas y todos ellos tienen un gran impacto en las áreas de funcionamiento del niño (académica, familiar y social). Algunos de esos síntomas son: dificultades para mantener la atención, para seguir instrucciones, parece no escuchar, comete errores por descuido, incapacidad para permanecer sentado mucho tiempo, hablar en exceso, le cuesta esperar su turno, interrumpe a los demás. &#x0D; En la última década, muchos autores han demostrado que las tecnologías de realidad virtual se utilizan cada vez más tanto en el área educativa como en el área de rehabilitación. &#x0D; La Realidad Virtual (RV), es una tecnología que simula un entorno imaginado o real, como un aula, una habitación o un parque. Al usar esta tecnología, los usuarios pueden interactuar y comportarse como lo harían en el mundo real.&#x0D; “Según la última versión del Manual Diagnóstico y Estadístico de los Trastornos Mentales (DSM-V), el TDAH afecta aproximadamente al 5% de los niños\"&#x0D; Los sistemas de RV se caracterizan por la interacción y la inmersión. La interacción entre la persona y el sistema de RV se logra a través de muchos canales sensoriales (vista, oído, tacto y olfato). La inmersión es el grado en que la persona se siente envuelta dentro del sistema. &#x0D; Gracias a estas características la realidad virtual tiene tres ventajas fundamentales en la rehabilitación de niños con TDAH: &#x0D; Por un lado, la flexibilidad, la cual permite individualizar el tratamiento ya que el terapeuta puede controlar el programa para adaptarlo y graduarlo según las necesidades del niño. Por otro lado, la seguridad, ya que es una de las principales preocupaciones de los padres. Los niños con TDAH pueden no tener desarrolladas las habilidades cognitivas necesarias para entender situaciones peligrosas y detectarlas. La RV ofrece entornos realistas y seguros. Por último, la generalización del aprendizaje de un entorno (colegio) a otro (casa) muchas veces es un reto para los terapeutas. Gracias a la RV el niño puede realizar las actividades en un entorno simulado facilitando la transferencia al entorno real. &#x0D; En definitiva, los sistemas de realidad virtual proporcionan al terapeuta un equilibrio entre la flexibilidad y el control del programa de tratamiento. El realismo del entorno simulado ofrece al niño el aprendizaje de habilidades de manera segura y además permite que estas habilidades se transfieran a su vida cotidiana. &#x0D; La RV no sólo es útil en el tratamiento del niño con TDAH si no que tiene también la capacidad de realizar algunas pruebas neuropsicológicas de una manera más fiable, como es el caso de la prueba de rendimiento continuo ( “Continous Performance Test” o CPT por sus siglas en inglés), prueba muy utilizada tanto en la práctica clínica como en la investigación del TDAH que evalúa la atención sostenida y selectiva y la impulsividad. &#x0D; Numerosos estudios concluyen que la RV mejora la memoria, la función ejecutiva y los diferentes tipos de atención (atención focalizada), la atención sostenida, la atención selectiva, la atención alternante y la atención dividida) en niños con TDAH. &#x0D; Dependiendo del tipo de interacción entre el niño y el sistema existen distintos tipos de sistemas de RV. Sistemas de gestos, sistemas basados en el sistema táctil y sistemas enfocados en la retroalimentación. &#x0D; Por un lado, los sistemas con interacción basada en gestos son aquellos que han incorporado cámaras que capturan el movimiento o los gestos del niños de manera que el niño interacciona en tiempo real con los objetos virtuales. Por otro, los sistemas con interacción basada en el sistema táctil, que constan de dispositivos como ratones, joysticks o pantallas táctiles. Por último, los sistemas de interacción enfocada en la retroalimentación, que utilizan la RV como el medio para proporcionar un refuerzo. &#x0D; “La Realidad Virtual es una herramienta útil para la evaluación y tratamiento de niños con TDAH ”&#x0D; La RV se puede aplicar a niños con otras patologías muy frecuentes en poblaciones pediátricas como la parálisis cerebral o el autismo, donde la RV ayudará a mejorar déficits motores que afectan a las funciones de las extremidades superiores e inferiores y al control postural en el caso de la Parálisis Cerebral (PC) y dificultades en la socialización y comunicación en el caso del Trastorno del Espectro Autista (TEA). &#x0D; En definitiva, la RV permite que los niños puedan aprender y desarrollar habilidades específicas para ellos en un entorno seguro para después transferirlo a un entorno real y además estar en un proceso de continuo aprendizaje gracias a la posibilidad de adaptación y graduación del programa por parte del terapeuta.&#x0D;",

      "title": "Myoclonus",
      "abstract": "Extract Introduction Definition and description Myoclonus is brief electric shock-like jerks. It is a common normal experience. For example, the jerks of the body that sometimes occur when falling asleep (hypnic jerks) and hiccups are both forms of myoclonus. What causes myoclonus? Myoclonus is caused by brief activation of a group of muscles, leading to a jerk of the affected body part. This activation can arise from the cortex, subcortical structures (including the brainstem), the spinal cord, or nerve roots and plexi. Myoclonus is different from tremor, where alternate activation of agonists and antagonists produces a shaking movement. Myoclonus is different from dystonia where prolonged simultaneous activation of agonists and antagonists occurs, pulling the affected limb into an abnormal posture. Negative myoclonus Sometimes myoclonus produces a temporary cessation of muscle activity: negative myoclonus. If negative myoclonus affects the legs, then the patient may fall. The ‘liver flap’ (asterixis) that medical students are taught to look for in patients with suspected liver failure is caused by negative myoclonus.",

      "abstract": "This birth according to Freud [3] constitutes a violent shock affecting the mother who did not expect it and is experienced as a trauma which can disrupt the psychic functioning of the parents [4].Thus, the mother's psychic apparatus is overwhelmed by too much excitement and collapses, while becoming disorganized [3].This corresponds to what Marty [5] described as excesses.Indeed, for him, the trauma would be an excess of stimulation, of image, an absence of sense, an excess of anxiety, an overflow of capacities of capacity etc.The mother's psyche following a premature birth thus faces an overflow of her defenses due to numerous violent excitations which gradually disorganizes her.As faced with this extraordinary birth and the psychological trauma that it induces, many mothers get bogged down in mental suffering while others manage to maintain stable operation.This demonstrates their capacity for resilience, that is, in the latter, there is a developmental recovery following the confrontation with the trauma.",

      "abstract": "Clinical Causes, i. Increasedfunctional activity.2. Congenital tendency, e. g., giant growth of certain parts.3. Removal of pressure.The growth of certain structures is kept within bounds by the pressure of adjacent organs.We com- monly find increased thickness of the skull in cases where parts of the brain are absent.4. Direct stimulation, taking the form of intermittent pressure ; e. g., corns.Constant pressure leads to atrophy. 5. Disturbances of nutrition, (a) Direct disturbances (trophic) of innervation, as thickening of the skin in some nerve lesions.{b) Interference with the function of certain obscure organs, viz., the thyroid gland, the thymus, the pituitary body, and probably the suprarenal capsules.There is a disease known as Acromegaly, which is characterized hy an enlargement of the extremities, chiefly the hands, and of the face.Both the bony and the soft parts are involved.In a number of cases the disease was associated with pathologic changes in the pituitary body. ATROPHY.Atrophy is a diminution in the bulk of one or more of the component parts of an organ.Since the more important tissue- elements are usually affected, there is also a diminution of functional activity.Normal examples are the atrophy of the thymus gland in early life; of the umbilical blood-vessels after birth; and of the female reproductive organs at the menopause.There may be small- ness of size not due to atrophy.For example, an organ may be diminutive from an arrest of development, a condition termed hypoplasia.It is seen in chlorosis, in which we frequently find that the sexual organs and the heart and great vessels are abnormally small.Total absence of an organ or a part of an organ is called aplasia or agenesis ; it gives rise to monstrosities.Morbid Physiology.-Atrophy is brought about either by an insufficiency in the food supply of the cells, or by an inability on the part of the cells to use the nutritive material brought to them.It is (a) simple, due to a diminution in the size of the cells, without marked change in their protoplasm, or (^) degenerative, due to a breaking down of the protoplasm of the cells.Morbid Anatomy.-(a) Macroscopy.An atrophic organ is smaller; its outline is usually retained, although the surface maybe lo NOTES ON PATHOLOGY.irregular; the consistency is, as a rule, greater than normal, on account of a relative or absolute increase of the connective tissue ; its color is darker, from a relative excess of pigment ; frequently, too, new pigment is deposited. .{b) Microscopy.The cells are diminished in size or degenerated ; the connective tissue is increased.Brown Atrophy occurs in organs the seat of chronic con- gestion, especially in the heart and liver.Clinical Causes.i.Senile changes.-These are to a certain extent physiologic ; are pathologic when occurring early.They affect especially the testicle, heart and lungs (senile emphysema).2. Defective nutrition.(a) General, as in starvation.(h) Local deficiency of blood-supply, as from obstruction of an artery.FATTY INFILTRATION.il it is termed obesity or polysarcia ; in the liver, in the heart, around atrophic organs, etc.In obesity certain parts, as the eyelids, the alae nasi, the lobules of the ears, the Hps, and the prepuce escape.His- tologically, the fatty deposit affects both the cells and the inter- cellular substance, the red corpuscles and the ganglion cells of the nervous system being alone exempt.Morbid Physiology.-There exists in fatty infiltration a disturbance of the fat-building and fat-storing functions.The deposit of fat may be due to an excess of food ingested or to an impairment in the consumption of the fat normally brought to cell.Defective oxidation is at the bottom of the process.All food-stuffs, fats, albuminoids, and carbohydrates may give origin to the deposit of fat, particularly the last-named.The albuminous food may be converted into fat within the body ; thus, the cow which consumes but little fat produces a large quantity of it out of the vegetable proteids.Certain post-mortem changes also illustrate the derivation of fat from albuminous substances ; adipocere^a fatty material, may be formed out of the muscles after death.Animals fed on carbohydrates deposit fat.Bees produce wax out of the plant-sugar upon which they feed.How this conver- sion is brought about within the body is not known.Morbid Anatomy.ia)Macroscopy.The size of the organ is increased, but the outline is preserved ; the consistency is usually diminished, yet it may not be greatly altered ; the color is yellowish, either uniformly or in streaks, the latter being the case especially in the heart.The surface of section shows minute fat droplets, and the knife used is oil-stained.(8) Microscopy.Primarily the fat is deposited in small granules, which have a tendency to run together to form large rounded droplets, possessing a light center and a dark contour, or vice versa, depending on the manner of focusing.The protoplasm and nucleus are pushed to one side.The latter retains its structure and can be seen distinctly unless covered by the fat-droplet.In fatty degeneration the tendency of the fat-granules to run together is excep- tional.Fatty infiltration may be selective, affecting particular parts ©f an organ.In the heart, for instance, it is found in the connective tissue between the muscle fibers, and beneath the pericardium.In 12 NOTES ON PATHOLOGY.the liver it is especially marked toward the periphery of the acini, where the portal vein deposits the fat coming from the digestive tract.Chemically, the fat of fatty infiltration is the same as that found in the body normally, namely, a mixture of the neutral fats, stearin, palmatin, and olein.In the horse olein predominates, the fat therefore is soft and yellow ; in cattle the harder and whiter stearin is chiefly found.After death, and in certain pathologic states, such as gangrene and other degenerations, dur- ing life, the fat may take on a crystalline form, the crystals being needle-shaped, the so-called margaric-acid crystals, or in large rhombic (a) choiesterin, (*) Fat-platcs, cach with a comcr cut out, constituting ''^'°'^;J:L'c:r\"°' the cholestenn-plates.Clinical Causes.i.Heredity.This is the important factor in general obesity.2. Disturbed digestion.This may cause chemical changes favoring the deposit of fat ; generally, however, it is associated with an excessive appetite.3. Lack of exercise.Not only does deficient physical exercise conduce to fatty infiltration, but also lessened mental activity, as is seen in certain forms of insanity.In fattening animals it is cus- tomary to restrict their exercise to the lowest limit by confinement.4. Anemia^probably by lessening oxidation-processes.We may have an extensive deposit of fat in chlorosis.The fattening of animals for slaughter may be hastened by one or two bleedings.5. Alcohol.The ingestion of alcohol, especially in the form of malt-liquors, favors the deposit of fat either by increasing the consumption of food or by diminishing oxidation.6. Local disturbances of circulation interfering with the proper nutrition of a part. CALCAREOUS INFILTRATION OR CALCIFICATION.Calcification is the deposition in the tissues of earthy salts, principally the carbonates and phosphates ot calcium and magnesium.Physiologic example.The deposit of salts in bone.The salts of pathologic calcification do not differ from those deposited in health.6 NOTES ON PATHOLOGY.Morbid Anatomy.-Wefind the insoluble pigments in bruises-here chiefly as hemosiderin-and in hemorrhages in the interior of organs.In the latter instance the pigment is apt to remain for a long time, assuming often a bluish or slate color, as in the intestines after an attack of dysentery.Tests for blood-pigment.To a watery solution of the blood- stain add tincture of guaiac; a white or whitish-red precipitate is produced which turns blue on the addition of an ethereal solution of hydrogen dioxid.The blue precipitate may be dissoiv^ed out with alcohol. (Almen's Test.)This test is very characteristic.The spectroscopic test, which is absolutely positive.The spectrum of hemoglobin (i.e. oxy-hemoglobin), consists of two dark bands, one at the junction of the yellow and green, the other in the middle of the green.Non-oxidized hemoglobin presents a single band, which may be considered to be the result of the union of the two oxy-hemoglobin bands.It is, however, smaller than the combined width of these two bands.Methemoglobin gives rise to three dark bands, the two characteristic of oxy-hemoglobin, with an additional one in the orange.Bile-pigmentation : Jaimdice^or Icterus.Since bile is elaborated exclusively by the liver, the origin of jaundice must always be hepatogenous.It may, however, arise in one of two ways : (a) from simple obstruction of the bile-ducts ; {$) from excessive forma- tion of bile-pigment, this generally occurring when there is an ex- aggerated destruction of blood-coloring matter.It is the latter form to which some clinicians give the name of hematogenous jaundice.Tests, Bile-pigment is insoluble in water and in alcohol ; it is soluble in chloroform, and gives a pretty play of color with nitrous acid or nitric acid containing nitrous acid fumes.{Gmelin-Heifits' Test)Ferrous sulphid, FeS.This results from the action of hydrogen sulphid on the iron contained in the hemoglobin.It is seen post- mortem in the abdominal walls and peritoneum, as a diffuse bluish discoloration.Metabolic Pigmentation.-Thepigment-called melanin -is elaborated out of the protoplasm of the cells, without the intervention of blood-pigment.It occurs normally in the skin the choroid, in hair, etc.Its composition is variable-sometimes it contains iron, at others it does not.Sulphur is generally present.I8 NOTES ON PATHOLOGY.any point, disease develops, at one time serous infiltration, at another, as we shall see later, inflammation.(4) Through changes in the walls of the blood-vessels : {a) over-distension {b) disease of the vessel-walls.Character of the Fluid.It has the same composition as the lymph, but contains more water and less corpuscular elements.From inflammatory fluid, which it resembles, it is distinguished by being less inspissated.Its specific gravity does not exceed 1016, and its proportion of albumin is less than three per-cent.Inflam- matory fluid is denser and contains more albumin.Morbid Anatomy-[a) Macroscopy.The part, as a limb, is swollen, pale, somewhat translucent in appearance, pits on pressure, and has a lower temperature than the same part in health.In the case of the lung, we find that the organ is enlarged and on section oozes a frothy serum.Different terms are employed, according to the seat of the effusion : NOTES ON PATHOLOGY.AMYLOID DEGENERATION.This is a progressive degenerative process, affecting especially the connective tissues, and giving rise to the formation of a sub- stance characterized by the amyloid reaction.It is not found in health, although it occurs at times in organs belonging to apparently healthy individuals-it is there indicative of local disease. Seats.Liver, kidney, spleen, walls of the intestines and heart, nervous system and prostate gland.The first three of these are affected with equal frequency, and more often than the other organs.Morbid Physiology-Amyloid substance is the result of a reaction occurring between something derived from the blood and the juices of the tissues.It does not exist preformed in the blood, therefore its deposit is not an infiltration.The ultimate cause of its formation is perhaps in many cases, but not in all, the loss of potassium salts.The amyloid material is an albuminoid.It contains less potas- sium and phosphoric acid and more sodium and chlorin than nor- mal tissue.Alkalies and acids do not dissolve it, and it is very resistent to peptic digestion and to putrefactive processes.Morbid Anatomy.-(a) Macroscopy.The affected organ is larger than normal, the increase in size being at times remarkable, the outline is uniform, the borders, if the organ have any, are rounded, the sub- stance of the organ is denser, i. e., less friable, the elasticity is decreased-the organ may be doughy and may pit on pressure.The surface of section is paler than normal, and is somewhat translucent at the edges.The appearance is well described by the term \" waxy \" or \" bacony.\"As a rule the organ is affected uniformly.Not rarely, however, the process is circumscribed to minute areas ; indeed, it may not be apparent to the naked eye at all, unless the characteristic test is applied.It is particularly in the spleen and kidney that the degeneration shows a tendency to limitation.In the former it selects the lym- phoid bodies and adjacent blood-vessels, the condition produced Amyloid degeneration in kidney. NOTES ON PATHOLOGY.The gentian-violet reaction is also given by levulose, while cholesterin and glycogen respond to the iodin-test.The amyloid reaction consists in the development of a blue color when iodin and sulphuric acid are applied to amyloid sub- stance.It is not always obtained, nor is it important.The failure to get it in all cases suggests the possibility that the amyloid substance is not always of the same composition, but that there is a series qf related degenerations leading up to amyloid.The starch reaction is most frequently given by the amyloid bodies.Clinical Causes.-Chronic suppuration^especially that dependent upon tuberculous or syphilitic bone-disease.Amyloid Bodies.-These are small masses of concentrically arranged amyloid material, which are found in the prostate gland ^.nd in the nervous system.The change is here not progressive.The bodies involve the epithelium rather than the connective tissue-at least in the prostate glands, where the epithelial lining of the follicles is affected.They may occur in healthy prostate glands, but are most common in the prostates of old persons in whom the organ is hypertrophied, and its follicles are in a state of catarrhal inflam- mation.In the prostrate gland the bodies are visible to the naked eye, and frequently contain pigment (\"grains of snuff\").In the nervous system they are microscopic in size, and are found beneath the ependyma of the cavities.Though met with in healthy brains and cords, they are most abundant in sclerotic conditions and in epilepsy.They give the iodin-reaction. HYALINE DEGENERATION.This consists in the formation of a substance similar in appear- ance and composition to amyloid material, but not presenting the reactions peculiar to the latter.It attacks almost exclusively the connective tissue, particularly of the walls of the blood-vessels, and shows no tendency to spread to surrounding tissues.The organs in the vessels of which",

      "abstract": "The psychopathology of stroke encompasses several psychiatric and behavioral disorders that have high prevalence in the geriatric population, reduce the patient autonomy and increase the caregiver's burden. These disorders are usually associated with other cognitive and neurological deficits, and are labelled as neuropsychiatric when the whole clinical picture is consistent with the specific dysfunction of a neural system or brain region. Thus the neuropsychiatry of stroke comprises disorders of the perception/identification of the self and the environment (anosognosia of hemiplegia, misidentification syndromes, confabulations, visual hallucinations, delirium and acute confusional state), amotivational syndromes (apathy and athymhormia), disorders of emotional reactivity (blunted affect, emotional incontinence, irritability, catastrophic reactions), poor impulse or ideation control (mania) and personality changes. The clinical profile of the subcortical vascular dementia also points to specific brain dysfunction (frontal-subcortical pathways) that manifests with behavioral (depression, emotionalism, irritability) and cognitive symptoms (psychomotor retardation, attention, executive and memory deficits). However, post-stroke depression and anxiety, which have a more variable clinical presentation and might be assimilated, for several aspects, to post-traumatic or adaptive disorders, are disorders less characterized in their neural correlates.",

      "abstract": "The purpose of this focused review is to provide an overview of neuromuscular scoliosis from the perspective of the rehabilitation physician. Scoliosis is a common consequence of neuromuscular diseases, including central nervous system disorders such as cerebral palsy and spinal cord injury; motor neuron disorders, for example, spinal muscular atrophy; muscle fiber disorders, for example, Duchenne muscular dystrophy; multifactorial disorders, for example, spina bifida; and many other neuropathic and myopathic conditions. Unlike adolescent idiopathic scoliosis, which is the most common form of spinal deformity, neuromuscular scoliosis is more severe and more progressive, and is associated with more morbidity. Factors that contribute to this spinal deformity include asymmetric paraplegia, imbalance of mechanical forces, intraspinal and congenital anomalies of the spine, altered sensory feedback, and abnormal posture via central pathways. Spinal deformity combined with limitations due to an underlying neuromuscular condition lead to significant physiologic impairments that affect limb movement, cardiopulmonary function, gait, standing, sitting, balance, trunk stability, bimanual activities, activities of daily living, and pain, as well as concerns with self‐image and social interactions. Evaluation and management of this population requires understanding of disease progression, pulmonary status, functional limitations, indications for conservative and surgical interventions, and social considerations.",

      "title": "Neuropsychological Characteristics of Huntington’s Disease",
      "abstract": "Abstract Huntington’s disease (HD) is a progressive disease of the brain that causes movement abnormalities (especially chorea and dystonia), cognitive deterioration, and affective disturbances. Symptoms typically begin around age 40, with wide variation (Bell, 1934; Heathfield and McKenzie, 1971; Folstein et al., 1987). As in many other neurodegenerative disorders, early onset of HD is associated with more severe disease and a more rapid course. Onset of the disease in childhood is marked by akinesia, rigidity, severe intellectual impairment, and shorter survival (Merritt et al., 1969; Conneally, 1984; Bryois, 1989). Late-onset disease usually presents with severe chorea but milder cognitive impairment, and has a more gradual decline (Myers et al., 1985, 1991). Symptoms of HD progress relentlessly, with patients becoming severely demented, motorically dilapidated, unable to care for themselves, and eventually bedridden. There is no cure for the illness, and the only treatments currently available are either purely palliative or purely experimental. Death occurs an average of 15 to 17 years after disease onset (Folstein, 1989). Huntington’s disease causes untold suffering for those afflicted and their loved ones.",

Such developmental deviation is likely to be accompanied by certain psychic and pathologic disturbances. Mental deficiency, perhaps thyrogenous, in an infant under 10 months of age, is usually betrayed by such signs and symptoms as lack of the sucking reflex, delayed aptitude for holding the head erect, fixing the eyes, recognizing parents and relatives, grasping and playing with objects, turning over, sitting unaided and standing with aid. Subsequently, the most reliable evidences of mental development will depend on the as similation of language, walking, control of the sphincters, school progress and mental tests. It should be added here that results of the latter are by no means absolute, much being contingent on personal interpretation and ruling out of all possible misleading factors.",

      "abstract": "The relevance of the work is due to the fact that the professional activities of law enforcement officers in wartime conditions have become as close as possible in terms of content to the performance of combat missions. In this context, the issues of violations of law enforcement officers' adaptation to a new extreme professional environment have become relevant. The purpose of our work was to identify the most informative markers of law enforcement officers' maladaptation in conditions of participation in combat operations. Maladaptation in the work is presented as a violation of a person's adaptation to environmental changes, which is manifested by inadequate reactions to the nature of stimuli. The most common psychological phenomena that indicate a breakdown of compensatory mechanisms of the psyche and precede maladaptive disorders are: nervous demobilization syndrome, stressful search activity, torpid reaction, which manifests itself in a boring, disoriented state; reaction of dissociation of subject and object, indefinite temporary state, illusion of false invulnerability (frivolity, reckless actions, etc.), pseudo-primitivism (indifference, passive submission and apathy), delusion of grandeur in miniature, experience of loss of the future (feeling of inner emptiness and meaninglessness of existence), temporary addictive behaviour (aggressiveness, use of alcohol and drugs, etc.). It has been established that the psychological state of police combatants is influenced by a number of factors, the timely processing of which significantly reduces the level of maladaptive disorders. Such factors include the lack of combat experience and appropriate behavioural patterns, knowledge of what to do in a particular combat situation, necessary developed skills and abilities, clear organization, and, conversely, the presence of a negative example from a commander or reference persons, death, injury of colleagues, and personal level of response.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Concussion is a temporary change in brain functioning, or the ability of the brain to do its job, that can occur in any number of ways. Concussion—sometimes called mild traumatic brain injury—is different from other forms of head injury. Concussions usually involve some temporary disruption of thinking skills or brief alteration of awareness, among other symptoms. Concussion has many different acute symptoms, and these same symptoms occur in a variety of health conditions and situations, which can sometimes make concussions difficult to detect. Symptoms may affect physical, cognitive, or emotional functioning as well as sleep.",

Because of the resulting deficits, the normal movement of the injured child toward increased independence is thwarted, and he or she often moves back to a state of increased dependency. The spectrum of sequelae may be mild to severe and includes almost the full range of child and adolescent psychopathology, perhaps because one of the most common and striking sequela is enhancement of previously existing disturbances. A syndrome of behavioral disinhibition is a disorder unique to this population.The psychiatric sequelae often appear as the physical and cognitive status improves in the year following injury, and they may eventually dominate the clinical picture.Duration of coma and of posttraumtic amnesia are measures of global brain dysfunction and are the best indicators of overall prognosis.Many child and adolescent patients with sequelae of severe closed head injuries have had histories of psychiatric on behavioral disorders or drug or alcohol abuse prior to their injury. Posttraumatic psychiatric sequelae consist of the same behavioral and psychiatric disorders that affect children or adolescents who have not had head injuries.Standard treatment methods for similar on other diagnostic entities are being tailored to the needs of children and adolescents with severe closed head injury. Medications are currently being used to control symptoms of aggression, agitation, and impairment of memory.

      "title": "Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Unmasked through Recurrent Psychogenic Cough",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor, Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a psychiatric condition that develops following exposure to traumatic events such as actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence, which one experiences, witnesses, or listens to.[1] Although the research into the concept and diagnosis of PTSD remains debatable, it typically manifests through reliving experiences, avoidance behavior toward trauma reminders, and hyperarousal. However, the new description of trauma itself has become fluid, with atypical and low magnitude experiences like watching an animation series or eating spoiled food are also equated to trauma.[2] Further, dissociation and somatization are reported in as much as 70% of cases of PTSD.[3] Furthermore, there are atypical manifestations of PTSD, especially in children, such as repetitive play involving traumatic events, sleep disturbances, self-blame, behavioral regression, and somatization.[4] This case highlights an unusual manifestation of PTSD, where a recurrent non-productive cough emerged as the predominant symptom in the absence of any identifiable organic pathology, a symptom currently not reported as a part of PTSD in the literature. While standard management includes selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT), this report also supports the existing evidence for repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in refractory PTSD,[5] which has not been useful in dissociative disorders. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient. This is the case of a 19-year-old male, currently studying for a diploma, who was first seen at the age of 13 (in 2019) in this hospital with complaints of abrupt episodes of fearfulness and palpitation with eventual loss of consciousness lasting for approximately half an hour. This was triggered by thoughts of traumatic events, of being beaten by his father's employer on one occasion, and bullying in school. It was accompanied by academic underperformance, disturbed sleep, and intermittent absenteeism from school. There were no obvious reliving experiences. His developmental milestones were reportedly normal. He was given a diagnosis of dissociative disorder and a differential diagnosis of PTSD. He was started on 2.5 mg of escitalopram per day. Subsequently, he was lost to follow-up. In August 2024, he was once again referred to our hospital with complaints of intense, non-productive coughing spells lasting about 1 h, associated at times with chest pain, palpitations, and anxiety. He was first evaluated by emergency medicine, cleared of organicity, and then referred to psychiatry. Further exploration revealed a history of repeated physical abuse by his father's employer using a belt or stick, that lasted for more than a year during 2021–2022. Both families stayed in the same compound, and the employer and his son would do this when his parents were away at work. This was because he was not good at studies. It was stopped later when his father reprimanded his employer. However, the patient started to get episodes of coughing as explained above. The local physician referred him to a psychiatrist who again started him on escitalopram 10 mg/day, but it was not effective this time. The patient was taken to another psychiatrist who gave him dothiepin 50 mg/day. As it was also ineffective, even after several months, he was referred to us. He was provisionally diagnosed as having a dissociative disorder. However, on serial mental status examination, it was revealed that whenever his class teacher yelled at or punished any student, this would remind him of the abuse that had happened to him at home, and he would start coughing for hours. It was as if he was being beaten up then and there. He would avoid any situation that involved yelling or any kind of abuse, as it would trigger such episodes. At school, he would remain vigilant of such events happening and used to have frequent absences. His diagnosis of PTSD as per International Classification of Diseases 11th Revision (ICD-11) was confirmed, based on the history of trauma, reliving experiences expressed as cough, avoidance of the school environment that reminds him of trauma, and being vigilant when at school or wherever he perceives threats. He was started on desvenlafaxine, propranolol, and clonazepam, and the dose was built up to 150 mg, 40 mg, and 1 mg, in that order. Both the patient and his family were educated regarding the nature and course of the illness as well as the importance of adherence to treatment. The grounding techniques and relaxation techniques were taught to the patient. He was partially better and was discharged after 10 days. However, the patient reported with worsening of cough despite medication, in October 2024. Further increase in the dose of desvenlafaxine to 200 mg did not help, prompting consideration of rTMS. He underwent 20 sessions of intermittent theta-burst stimulation (iTBS) targeting the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, over 5 days, as per the evidence.[6] Following this, he showed rapid improvement in cough frequency, with alleviation of anxiety symptoms. He was discharged on 200 mg desvenlafaxine, 10 mg buspirone, 0.75 mg clonazepam, and 1 mg risperidone was added for the excessive fear as a trauma response. He was maintaining well during follow-ups in November and December. However, due to significant improvement, he abruptly stopped medication in January 2025 and reported back in February 2025, following the trigger of witnessing a road traffic accident, presenting again with cough episodes. Given prior good response, rTMS was re-initiated, and desvenlafaxine 100 mg and clonazepam 0.5 mg were reintroduced. The patient showed significant clinical improvement by the end of 20 sessions of rTMS. Grounding techniques and breathing exercises were reinforced, and the patient was discharged on the same medication. He has been coming ever since for follow-up and psychotherapy sessions on stress management and relaxation. This case highlights a rare and strikingly atypical presentation of PTSD, in which psychogenic cough emerged as the predominant symptom, overshadowing the usual features such as reliving experiences, avoidance, and hyperarousal, but triggered by trauma reminders. It brings attention to the complex and often underappreciated interplay between psychological trauma, dissociative responses, and somatic symptomatology. Such presentations challenge conventional diagnostic frameworks and underscore the need for clinical vigilance in identifying non-traditional manifestations of trauma-related disorders. Although superficially it appears to be a dissociative disorder, the trauma and demonstrable reliving, avoidance, and hypervigilance established the diagnosis of PTSD. There are published atypical presentations of PTSD. A child perceived an animation series as traumatic and was later diagnosed with PTSD.[2] An African refugee in America presented with chronic abdominal and back pain, which was later found to be a trauma response to stabbing and hence was diagnosed with PTSD.[7] A 12-year-old girl with a history of ankle sprain after a road traffic accident persisted to have chronic ankle pain and PTSD, was diagnosed.[8] A Turkish soldier presented with spontaneous ejaculations, and it was his presentation of PTSD.[9] Our patient reported a recurrent cough. The case further exemplifies the importance of a comprehensive, mu ltimodal treatment, incorporating pharmacotherapy, neuromodulation (rTMS), and psychotherapy. The patient's significant clinical improvement following rTMS reinforces its therapeutic value among poor responders to conventional treatment of PTSD. Despite growing evidence supporting its efficacy,[10] rTMS remains underutilised, possibly due to limited accessibility and high costs. All in all, PTSD can have diverse presentations, and clinicians' careful assessment is the key.

      "abstract": "Summary: Intellectual deterioration in epilepsy may be real or apparent. The latter refers to delay in cognitive development such that performance against age‐related norms appears to drop. The former, real deterioration can occur due to concomitant degenerative neurological disease of which epilepsy is also a symptom, or it may happen as a consequence of one or more of a number of other factors. These include (1) direct effects of seizures and abnormal electroencephalogram activity on brain function, (2) traumatic brain injury secondary to seizures, including status epilepticus, (3) the influence of antiepileptic therapy, both drugs and surgery, on cognitive function, (4) psychosocial sequelae of diagnosis. Some epilepsy syndromes include intellectual deterioration as a frequent feature, with various causes. Developmental factors may also play a part. Cognitive functioning may be impaired by the presence of an epileptogenic lesion, and also in different ways and at different times by other brain areas involved with partial seizures, including irritative and functional deficit zones. Abnormal activity in these areas at critical periods in development may interact and disrupt pathways necessary for maturation of frontal lobe and limbic system functioning, leading to long‐term neurological deficits. Increased understanding of the mechanisms by which this may happen raises intriguing possibilities for prevention and remediation.",

The basic deficit of an apraxic patient lies in the fact that the production of different natural movements is no longer possible. This can apply to complex manual actions or gestural movements, but also to routine everyday actions, such as dressing oneself or walking. Following acute brain damage, apraxias can appear at least as commonly as paresis or elementary motor disturbances.",

      "title": "MALINGERING OF ORGANIC ILLNESS OR MENTAL DISORDER",
      "abstract": "of “simulation” covers dissimulation or deception, as well as faking, but the type of simulation we are concerned with here is normally defined as malingering, which refers to the conscious and deliberate invention of a physical or mental disorder, or the attribution of an existing incapacity to an accident or illness which was not actually its cause, in order to derive some personal benefit. The DSM-IV defines malingering as “the intentional feigning or exaggeration of physical or psychological symptoms, motivated by external incentives such as avoidance of work or military service, receipt of financial compensation, evasion of criminal prosecution, or procurement of prescription drugs. Under certain circumstances, malingering may constitute adaptive behaviour: for example, feigning illness while in captivity as a prisoner of war” (American Psychiatric Association, 1995, p. 698). The concept is considered more closely by Resnick (1997), who distinguishes between pure malingering, simulation of a non-existent disorder; partial malingering, the conscious exaggeration of present symptoms or of a now-cured disorder; and false imputation, the erroneous attribution of real symptoms to a particular cause, due to non-deliberate self-deceit or a wrong interpretation of the situation. Gorman (1982) also distinguished between the act and the state of malingering, insofar as the act implies wilfulness, an assertive attitude of desire and purpose, while the state, from a legal point of view, would be inherent to the person, due to their social condition or possible limitations. On the other hand, the question arises as to whether malingering can, in itself, be the reflection of some mental disorder. This is fairly clearly the case in the so-called factitious disorder (American Psychiatric Association, 1994), in which the person intentionally feigns physical or psychological symptoms, with the aim of taking on the sick role, or in histrionic personality disorder, due to lack of control over one’s manipulative behaviour; however, the conscious exaggeration of physical or mental complaints in order to achieve a financial, professional or similar objective may also be a neurotic behaviour, since nobody “in their right mind” would normally go to such extremes, nor choose such tortuous and painful routes, in the pursuit of potential benefits. Nevertheless, the law does not make such distinctions, and considers certain behaviours to involve clear intention on the part of the person carrying them out (Gorman, 1982). The incidence of malingering after an accident is not well known, being estimated at between 1% and 50% of cases (Henderson, 1986; Miller & Catlidge, 1972), depending on whether the source of information is the claimant’s lawyer or the insurance company. An influential factor here concerns the financial and employment conditions, since it has been observed that such malingering increases when redundancies are immiMALINGERING OF ORGANIC ILLNESS OR MENTAL DISORDER",

      "abstract": "Abstract A concussion is a physiological disruption of brain function as a result of an external force to the head resulting in a loss or alteration of consciousness. Immediate postinjury objective signs of concussion are a person being dazed, confused, and disoriented, new onset of feeling nauseous or throwing up, or a period of loss of consciousness. Other postconcussion signs may include brief neurological impairments such as not being able to stand, walk, or converse sensibly immediately afterward. Acute subjective symptoms of concussion include feeling lightheaded, “seeing stars,” having blurred vision, headaches, or experiencing ringing in the ears. Postconcussion syndrome (PCS), as the name suggests, is a characteristic complex of subjective symptoms that occurs subsequent to a concussion. In the vast majority of individuals these symptoms resolve within a time period ranging from minutes to 24–72 hours. Although some symptoms may last for days, approximately 90 percent or more of individuals who sustain a concussion are asymptomatic within a couple of weeks.",

      "title": "Mecanismos neurobiológicos e inmunes que subyacen al déficit en control inhibitorio: estudios preclínicos",
      "abstract": "El deficit de control inhibitorio es un problema social y de salud con un impacto economico sustancial y complejas implicaciones de diagnostico. Las fallas en el control inhibitorio a menudo resultan en consecuencias no deseadas para el individuo, generalmente expresadas en terminos de compulsividad y / o impulsividad. La compulsividad es una caracteristica central en el trastorno obsesivo-compulsivo (TOC) y tambien comorbida en varios trastornos neuropsiquiatricos, como la esquizofrenia, el autismo y la adiccion. Este comportamiento se define como la perseverancia de una respuesta irresistible e inapropiada para el individuo e inevitable a pesar de sus consecuencias negativas. Por otro lado, la impulsividad incluye acciones mal concebidas, prematuramente expresadas, excesivamente arriesgadas o inapropiadas para la situacion, y es un componente clave en todos los trastornos neuropsicopatologicos diferentes, incluido el trastorno por deficit de atencion con hiperactividad (TDAH), el autismo y la esquizofrenia. Sin embargo, ambos constructos tienen un posible significado de diagnostico cruzado, aplicandolos a comorbilidades y puntos en comun en una variedad de trastornos. Estudios preclinicos y clinicos han demostrado la implicacion de los circuitos fronto-estriatal-limbicos en el deficit de control inhibitorio. Especificamente, el receptor serotoninergico 5-HT2A ha demostrado estar implicado en conductas impulsivas y compulsivas. Por lo tanto, el objetivo de la presente tesis fue, primero, estudiar el papel de los receptores 5-HT2A de la corteza prefrontal medial (mPFc) en la bebida compulsiva en la polidipsia inducida por programa (SIP). Para ello, realizamos microinfusiones intra-mPFc de DOI -agonista de 5-HT2A/C-, M100907 -antagonista de 5-HT2A- y SB242084 - antagonista de 5-HT2C-. La activacion de los receptores 5-HT2A/C dentro del mPFc dio como resultado una reduccion de la bebida compulsiva en ratas altas bebedoras (HD) seleccionadas por SIP, efecto que se bloqueo por la administracion conjunta de M100907 pero no de SB242084. Ademas, investigamos si las ratas altas y bajas compulsivas seleccionadas por SIP mostraron diferencias basales en el “binding” del receptor 5-HT2A en estructuras cruciales para el control inhibitorio. Las ratas compulsivas HD menor “binding” en la amigdala basolateral (BLA) en comparacion con las bajas bebedoras (LD) seleccionadas por SIP. La plasticidad cerebral desadaptativa se ha relacionado con el deficit de control inhibitorio, subyacente a las diferencias individuales en cuanto a las conductas impulsivas o compulsivas en sujetos vulnerables. Por lo tanto, investigamos la morfologia de las estructuras cerebrales relacionadas con el control inhibitorio en animales altos y bajos compulsivos. Las ratas HD mostraron una disminucion del volumen del hipocampo y un aumento del volumen de BLA despues de la reexposicion SIP, comparadas con las HD no reexpuestas y la LD reexpuestas. La activacion inmune se ha propuesto como un factor crucial implicado en la vulnerabilidad al deficit de control inhibitorio gracias a su estudio con modelos preclinicos. En el presente trabajo expusimos a los animales a Lipopolisacarido (LPS) y a antigeno de estreptococo del Grupo A (GAS) en etapas tempranas con el fin de estudiar con tareas conductuales especificas sus posibles efectos a largo plazo en relacion con el deficit de control inhibitorio. Ademas, exploramos si esta vulnerabilidad podria ser dinamitada por el estres y/o paliada por el tratamiento con antibiotico. Tambien evaluamos los efectos en biomarcadores inmunes cerebrales, como la interleucina-6 (IL-6), la interleucina-17 (IL-17) y el factor de necrosis tumoral α (TNFα). La exposicion a LPS aumento la compulsividad mediante respuestas perseverativas en “5-choice serial reaction time task” (5-CSRT task). La exposicion a GAS incremento el comportamiento impulsivo por respuestas prematuras en la tarea 5-CSRT en condiciones basales, y tanto la exposicion a GAS como la administracion del antibiotico ampicilina incrementaron el comportamiento impulsivo despues de aumentar el intervalo entre ensayos (ITI) de 5 a 7s. Por otra parte, la exposicion a GAS incremento la toma de decisiones impulsivas en “delay-discounting task”, efecto que fue revertido delay=20s por el tratamiento antibiotico. La exposicion a GAS disminuyo los niveles de IL-6 y aumento los niveles de TNFα en NAcc, y mostro un efecto combinado cuando se administro con el antibiotico disminuyendo los niveles de IL-17 en PFc. Hubo una correlacion positiva entre los niveles de TNFα en NAcc y en PFc con ambas medidas de impulsividad. La presente tesis refuerza la idea de la implicacion de los receptores 5-HT2A en el deficit de control inhibitorio; especificamente, su activacion dentro de mPFc redujo la compulsividad en ratas HD en SIP. Se reportan alteraciones morfologicas en hipocampo y amigdala en ratas compulsivas seleccionadas por SIP, apuntando asi a cambios en la plasticidad cerebral como mecanismos subyacentes en trastornos psicopatologicos impulsivos-compulsivos. Ademas, la presente tesis muestra un papel putativo de la activacion inmune como factor de vulnerabilidad al deficit de control inhibitorio a largo plazo.",

      "abstract": "Dystonia is a movement disorder characterized by sustained muscle contractions that result in abnormal \"patterned\" movements and/or postural abnormalities. Based on the accompanying symptoms, dystonia can be classified as isolated (i.e., with dystonia only), combined (i.e., with other movement disorders such as myoclonus), or complex (i.e., with symptoms other than movement disorders such as mental retardation). Moreover, dystonia may affect single or multiple parts of the body and accordingly be classified as focal, segmental, multifocal, hemi, or generalized. The most common type of dystonia is isolated focal dystonia, often accompanied with a specific action (task-specific action). The \"task-specificity\" uniquely illustrates the nature of dystonia, and this phenomenon is most clearly observed in occupation-related dystonias that include musician's and athlete's dystonia. In this article, we first elucidate the general issues of common focal dystonia (cervical dystonia, blepharospasm, and focal hand dystonia) and then present several educational cases of occupational (task-specific) dystonia with some clinical pearls for practical management.",

      "abstract": "Madness has traditionally been seen as an illness of the mind, or even, more romantically, sickness of the soul. Contemporary biomedical approach views it as a brain disease caused by chemical imbalance of neurotransmitters. Its symptoms are also associated with mental activity such as perceptions, cognition, emotions and moods. Nevertheless, much of the impact of the so-called mental illness is voiced through the body. First of all, mental distress is often communicated in a myriad of bodily pains. Most common psychosomatic complaints include dizziness, headaches, backaches, skin problems, indigestion and fatigue. Then, many mentally ill have problems accepting and respecting their body functions, especially problematic are sexual needs, menstruation and eating. It is manifested either in fear of sexuality or, its opposite, compulsive promiscuity. A similar black-and- white attitude concerns food, which is either completely denied to the body in anorexia or abused in bulimic binging. The 'sick' attitude to the body parodies the paradoxes innate in Western culture, which splits the human being into binary opposites of flesh and soul. The aim of my chapter is to look at bodily manifestations of mental illness as recorded in women's madness narratives. I analyse the body image presented in them as well as the body-mind dichotomy the authors often experience. The texts I focus on include Sylvia Plath's The Bell Jar, Elizabeth Wurtzel's Prozac Nation, Marya Hornbacher's Wasted and Kate Grenville's Lilian's Story.",

The incidence of this disorder is increasing and it is no longer uncommon to encounter a child or adult with some form of autism spectrum disorder in their own environment.\r\n Despite this, autism is still a significant unknown to most people and a great challenge to anyone working with children or adults with this disorder. Their specifics in communication and interaction often make it difficult to interact with them, learn, work, and other activities.\r\n Autism spectrum disorder involves different forms of autism as well as differences in providing the level of support they need to function. Despite the large differences within the spectrum, there are some characteristics that connect them. Difficulties in communication (verbal and nonverbal), socialization (reduced desire to contact people, inappropriate relationships with others, lack of understanding of the way people cooperate with each other, communicate), and the existence of some repetitive actions or narrowed and specific interests or fixations are specific symptoms present. These symptoms are more or less present in all children and adults with autism spectrum disorder. These characteristics significantly affect the daily functioning of people and it is important to be aware of them in contact with each other, and the environment must know them and adapt to help them.\r\n In her daily work, the nurse often encounters children and adults with various difficulties or mental illnesses.

Consideration during the diagnostic process must be given to alternative organic conditions (prior or unsuspected severe TBI, pain, medication side effects or dementia), pre-existing non-organic conditions (active or dormant psychiatric conditions, pre-existing personality characteristics, or social/economic factors), non-clinical conditions (compensation/litigation, malingering) or post-injury psychiatric morbidity (notably depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, panic disorder, or conversion disorder). Scrupulous care must be given during the history, physical examination, and neuropsychologic assessment of the patient to evaluate for different or contributory diagnostic possibilities; not all patients that have symptoms following a blow to the head have traumatic brain injury as the sole etiologic agent for their symptoms.

The one-sided ideational context permeates interpersonal relations, intensifies family conflict and drains a considerable portion of available psychic energy. Disregard or an incorrect approach to this factor may result in painful therapeutic failure, since no exploratory psychotherapy or verbal intervention technique will be able to penetrate the monoideistic armour. THe continuous repetition of the dominant idea functions as a cumulative suggestion stimulus leading to disruption of spontaneous processes and self-defeating thinking, behavioral, motivational, and affective changes.

      "title": "Neurotoxic Disorders",
      "abstract": "The nervous system is commonly impacted by chemicals found in nature, elaborated by organisms, or synthesized by chemists. The peculiar architecture of neural cells, their high-energy demands, and the mandate for electrochemical communication combine to place the nervous system at high risk for chemical perturbation. This inherent vulnerability is exploited by natural agents, synthetic chemicals, medications, and recreational substances designed or used to target the nervous system as well as by a host of other substances that are occasionally encountered in the environment. The neurotoxic actions of chemicals are expressed in a wide range of neurologic phenomena, some of which are associated with purely functional changes, others with structural damage, and still others with both. Many chemicals cause effects that appear and disappear rapidly; others produce effects that evolve over days or weeks and regress over months or years. Diagnosis is heavily dependent on the history and characteristic clinical phenomenology. Specific treatment other than termination of exposure is rare. Although clinical improvement is the rule, neurotoxic disorders leave scars or disappear without a trace.",

      "abstract": "This study aims to explore gross motor developmental delays in 6-year-old children as an early indication of possible Tourette syndrome. Tourette syndrome is a neuropsychiatric disorder characterized by the emergence of spontaneous movements and sounds (tics) that are not realized and can interfere with the child's daily activities. In this study, a qualitative approach was used with a case study method on a boy in Malang City who showed symptoms of motor and vocal tics. Data collection was carried out through observation, in-depth interviews with teachers and parents, and documentation of the child's activities in the home and school environment. The results of the observation showed that the child had difficulty maintaining balance and showed spontaneous movements such as shaking his head, blinking, and clearing his throat repeatedly. These symptoms do not always appear consistently and occur more often when the child is tired or mildly stressed. Data analysis showed that motor delays were not caused by muscle disorders, but by an imbalance in neurological regulation that affects movement coordination. The main risk factors come from daily habits such as excessive use of gadgets, lack of rest time, and unstable emotional responses. The treatment carried out involves a combination of medication from a neurologist and environmental support such as reducing stress triggers, regulating playtime, and an inclusive educational approach. This study emphasizes the importance of early detection, holistic intervention, and ongoing support from families and educators in dealing with children with Tourette syndrome symptoms so that motor delays do not develop into more serious disorders.",

      "abstract": "Examples have been presented of children's behaviors that demonstrate the trauma-learning pattern of re-enactment, repetition, and displacement. They become persistent parts of the symptom complex of PTSD. The encapsulation phase occurs when the trauma event occurs and symptoms present themselves, but the events as yet are undisclosed. The trauma-specific behavior patterns, the general hyper-arousal symptoms, and the avoidant, numbing symptoms persist; the emerging disruptive behaviors are not linked to the traumatic event and reactions to the trauma. The response of the child's social and interpersonal context to the internalizing or externalizing behaviors post-trauma, continue shaping the internal cognitive schema of the child. When the child is unable to link ongoing, self-defeating, disruptive behavior to trauma experience, the underlying fear persists. This interferes with the child's ability to modulate emotions either through altering the persistence of refractory, self-limiting cognitive schema or the inability to use new experience to develop and grow. The flexibility of children to discriminate new information may be lost; the children are either numb to new information or hyperalert and perceive danger. Issues for treatment include children's distress over memories of the trauma and the lack of capacity to learn and develop from new interpersonal experiences. It has been our experience that nurses first must help the child relearn flexibility through self-observation, the element of self-soothing and calming behaviors, processing of new information, and strengthening of social relationships. With new and strengthened personal resources, the child then is able to begin to process the traumatic memories.",

The disorder is common in neurological services and frequently seen by psychiatrists working in such settings. It is often associated with chronic severe disability. The diagnosis previously hinged on the neurologist’s demonstration of the lack of disease and the psychiatrist’s hypothesis of a ‘conversion’ of stress into a physical symptom. It is now based on positive findings on neurological assessment supplemented by a psychiatric assessment to confirm the diagnosis. Comorbid anxiety and depression disorders are common. Treatment is multi-disciplinary. Explanation of the condition to the patient is a crucial initial step supplemented, where necessary, by psychological treatment (especially for dissociative or non-epileptic attacks) and physiotherapy for functional motor symptoms. The prognosis without treatment is poor once the disability is established.",

      "abstract": "In this chapter, we cover aggression associated with psychiatric, neurological, and general medical conditions. The focus is on hostile behaviors that threaten or inflict harm. Definitions of aggression, violence, and related terms used in this chapter are in Table 6–1 . Although most aggression involves intent to harm, the definition we use does not require it because clinically important aggressive behavior can occur in the absence of demonstrable intent—such as in patients with cognitive disorders. We set aside behaviors that may be characterized as agitation, such as yelling, screaming, and other nonthreatening outbursts; oppositional and resisting behaviors; intrusiveness; and fidgeting, pacing, and other hyperkinetic actions. We also do not address community violence or criminality. Terms used in this chapter Aggression Hostile, threatening, and violent actions directed at person(s) or object(s), sometimes with no (or trivial) provocation Violence Overtly aggressive actions directed at person(s) or object(s) Domestic violence Behaviors directed against an intimate partner, ranging from verbal abuse to threats and intimidation to sexual assault and violence Agitation A state of pathologically intense emotional arousal and motor restlessness Disinhibition A state in which the individual's capacity for preemptive evaluation and restraint of behavioral responses is decreased or lost Impulsivity A state characterized by a proneness to act without thought or self-restraint; a habitual tendency toward \"hair-trigger\" actions Irritability A state of abnormally low tolerance in which the individual is easily provoked to anger and hostility Psychiatrists mainly encounter aggression and violence when patients present for treatment in acutely ill states. Aggression may present as a complication of delusional psychoses, dementia, delirium, intoxication, personality disorders, and even adjustment disorder. It may complicate nonpsychiatric illnesses because it can develop when patients feel disregarded, dissatisfied, frustrated, confused, frightened, disenfranchised, thwarted, or angered by perceived mistreatment. Aggression can be perpetrated by men or women and by individuals of any age (except early infancy). It is seen in all patient care settings—outpatient clinics, inpatient units, rehabilitation programs, residential and custodial care facilities, nursing homes, and emergency departments (EDs). Aggressive behavior can result in involuntary confinement (in hospitals and jails), disruption of clinical and custodial care environments, longer hospital stays, and physical injury to patients, their caregivers, and their health care providers. Family members, home health aides, and health professionals who are repeatedly exposed to aggression generally experience demoralization, which adversely affects the quality of care the patient receives. In this chapter, we focus on aggression and violence in the medically ill, beginning with the frequency, correlates, risk factors, and causes of aggressive and violent behaviors in diverse clinical settings, with reference to the host, agent, and environment causal model. We also discuss elder abuse and intimate partner violence, which are not necessarily manifestations of illness but are important causes and correlates of psychiatric and medical morbidity (we do not address child abuse). We review the evaluation, case formulation, and differential diagnosis of aggression and the management of aggressive behavior in the general hospital, including the ED.",

      "abstract": "Abstract It is suggested that psychotherapeutic treatment during pregnancy can help a disturbed woman achieve better integration of internal resources and self-representations, thereby preventing postnatal maternal distress. The need for psychotherapeutic intervention related to childbearing is discussed and some special features of psychotherapy with pregnant women are described, including common phase-related themes, unusual therapeutic structure, transference/counter-transference issues for both individual and group work. Key therapeutic situations are indicated by delineating three somewhat overlapping subgroups of women, who may be particularly at risk during pregnancy due to factors in their current or past experience which constitute stressors when interacting with resensitized areas of intrapsychic vulnerability. Risk-indicators specified are: Conflicted pregnancies - including unplanned, untimely and 'wrong' (such as those resulting from incest or rape). Emotional sensitization - expectant mothers who for a variety of predisposing reasons (own or maternal obstetric history, previous stillbirth or neonatal loss) or neurotic disorders, are prone to emotional difficulties such as over-or undervaluation of foetus/baby, pregnancy and/or birth. Complicated pregnancies - examining some of the possible concurrent physical conditions (maternal illness, substance abuse or eating disorders, AIDS-imperilled babies, threatened miscarriage or maternal disability), life-events (bereavement, eviction, negative test results), socioeconomic difficulties (unemployment, housing problems, poor social support), emotionally impoverished marital relationship and unsupported women on their own.",

      "title": "Effectiveness of Rational Emotive Behaviour Therapy on Shyness: Influence of Age",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONShyness may be defined experientially as excessive self-focus characterized by negative self-evaluation that creates discomfort and/or inhibition in social situations and interferes with pursuing one's interpersonal or professional goals. The experience of shyness can occur at any or all of the following levels: cognitive, affective, physiological and behavioural and may be triggered by a wide variety of situational cues (Henderson and Zimbardo, 1998). Among the most typical situations are interactions with authorities and strangers, one on one opposite sex interactions, and unstructured social settings. Subcategories of shyness reflect the degree (i.e., mild social awkwardness to totally inhibiting social phobia) and frequency of experienced shyness and include chronic shyness (self-labeling as shy and the experience of shyness in numerous social situations), situational shyness (the experience of shyness in specific social situations), and shy extroverts (experience anxiety and negative self-evaluation but are publicly outgoing).Shyness, often start in adolescence and is centered on a fear of scrutiny by other people in comparatively small groups (as opposed to crowds), usually leading to avoidance of social situation (Schmidt et al., 1997). According to various statistics, around 40 to 50 percent of the people (and sometimes more) are involved in shyness. Shyness evokes negative effect, which leads to sadness, unhappiness and fearfulness, and tendency to describe oneself as 'shy natured' is associated with low global self esteem and with feelings of low self worth in several domains of the self (Crozier, 1995). Shy adolescents tended to be lower in self-esteem, more introverted, and more anxious than their non-shy counterparts (Lawrence and Bennett, 1992). Shy individuals also tend to lack confidence (Crozier, 1982), and express larger perceived skill deficits compared to non-shy individuals (Jackson et al., 1997). A common observation in virtually all shyness research is that the consequences of shyness are deeply troubling. A general observation in most of the shyness research is that the consequences of shyness are deeply troubling shyness leads to higher levels of anxiety (D'Souza, 2003), fear (D'Souza, Gowda and Gowda, 2006), depression and loneliness (Somesha and D'Souza, 2008, 2009).Researchers in India and abroad have proposed several treatment approaches to shyness from medication to life skills intervention to psychotherapy. Rational Emotive Behavior Therapy (REBT) theory is a method to understand and treat dysfunctional emotions and behaviors. It is a cognitive-behavioral approach that posits that inappropriate behaviors result not from an event but rather from irrational beliefs. REBT asserts that irrational beliefs lead to unhealthy negative emotions and behaviors, such as rage and guilt (Jensen, 2008). The present study is aimed at finding out the effectiveness of REBT on shyness among early and late adolescents in India.METHODSampleA large sample of adolescents (N=1200) between 12-18 years was screened for Shyness Assessment Test (SAT) and the samples who had high levels of shyness (scores more than 72) were selected. Next, the researcher selected 96 adolescents randomly and assigned them for the intervention of the study, 48 as experimental group and 48 students as control group. There were 24 early and 24 late adolescents in each group. The experimental group was administered REBT, while the control group was not given any specific intervention.ToolThe Shyness Assessment Test (SAT) was developed by D'Souza (2006) of Maharaja's College, University of Mysore. It consisted of 54 items and requires the subject to indicate his/her response by marking YES, NO or CAN'T SAY. The items in the test pertained to three domains of shyness-Cognitive/Affective, Physiological and Action oriented. Item analysis of the scale using SPSS program resulted in Cronbach's alpha coefficient of 0. …",

      "abstract": "In persons with impaired social regulation, the balance of value-need regulation is shifted towards the predominance of needs. Directions in their life are absent or their set is very limited. Their behavior is frequently situation-dependent. Social and psychological dysadaptation results from that the individual inadequately appraises the life situation and hence inadequately responds to the latter. The socially unacceptable behavior becomes normal up to criminogenic (theft, violence). In the homeless with tuberculosis, a change occurs in the structural hierarchy of vital activity motives by the motive-for-objective type. In this connection, there is a paradoxical attitude towards the disease for the purpose of acquiring a social benefit. In the homeless, the factors that are frustrating and inducing stress in ordinarily persons cause no emotional responses. This was a result of the mental defense worked out under constant stress.",

Post concussion syndrome is a constellation of symptoms that may follow a mild to moderate closed head injury. Symptoms of post concussion syndrome include headache, depression, irritability, memory impairment, alcohol intolerance, dizziness or vertigo, attention and concentration difficulties, and loss of libido. Concussion, minor head injury, and minor traumatic brain injury are difficult to define, compared with moderate or severe injury, in which structural damage is evident. The American Congress of Rehabilitation Medicine defined minor traumatic brain injury as “a traumatically induced physiological disruption of brain function” with at least one of the following: (1) any period of loss of consciousness; (2) any memory loss for events just before or after the accident; (3) any alteration in mental state at the time of the accident; and (4) focal neurologic deficits that may or may not be transient (Packard, 1999).",

The Equator approach entails weekly group meetings offering psycho-education and stabilising exercises to TPs staying in the shelter, and a behavioural screening of participants in close co-operation with on the spot counsellors. Trafficked men and women are frequently exposed to severe psychological trauma, characterised by physical and sexual violence and threats while trafficked. In the first days to weeks after having experienced traumatic events, people may exhibit mental health problems that can be consistent with an acute stress disorder (ASD). Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition that is triggered by one or more terrifying events; and symptoms may include intrusive, repetitive, and upsetting memories or uncontrollable thoughts of the ordeal, flashbacks (intrusive reliving of traumatic events), nightmares and severe anxiety, blunting of emotions or increased arousal, negative thoughts and feelings and, sometimes, severe personality changes.",

      "abstract": "The neuropeptide oxytocin (OT) becomes increasingly attractive not only for neurobiologists, psychologists and psychiatrists, but also for sociologists and economists promoted by the discovery of amazing behavioural functions it regulates, especially in the context of social interactions. The discovery of multiple pro-social as well as anti-stress effects of OT, which have been discovered in recent years, makes the OT system of the brain a promising target for psychotherapeutic intervention and treatment of numerous psychiatric illnesses, for example, anxiety disorders, social phobia, depression or autism (Slattery & Neumann, 2010). The endogenous OT system of the brain can be found in different activity forms. Consequently, neuronal OT synthesis, OT release within distinct regions of the brain, OT receptor binding and the intensity of OT behavioural effects can vary in dependence on the physiological (or pathophysiological) activity state, which will be outlined in more detail below. It is generally assumed that psychopathologies associated with impaired social interactions, such as autism, are accompanied by an impaired activity of the brain OT system, which may affect at least one of the above mentioned parameters.",

The main clinical effect of whole-body vibration exposure is low back pain. Effects from hand-transmitted vibration can be (1) vascular, with manifestations of secondary Raynaud’s phenomenon; (2) neurological, often presenting as paraesthesia and reduced sensory perception; and (3) musculoskeletal, including reduced grip strength and loss of manual dexterity. In tropical countries, as opposed to temperate climates, the clinical manifestations are predominantly neurological and musculoskeletal, instead of vascular. Management requires exclusion of differential diagnoses, and the identification and reduction of exposure to vibration at source. Diagnosis of an index case should prompt further investigation and where possible, modification of the system of work to prevent other cases from occurring.",

Axons that project up from the brain stem are vulnerable, even in milder concussive injuries, and include axons that participate in key monoaminergic pathways. Although called diffuse axonal injury, the supra-tentorial injury component typically shows an anterior preponderance in humans. As the injury forces increase, cerebral contusions may be superimposed on the axonal strain injuries, and these contusions show an anterior preponderance as well. The chronic neuropsychiatric manifestations of TBI reflect this injury distribution. In the cognitive sphere, these manifestations almost always include power function disturbances marked by difficulties with cognitive processing speed, multitasking, and cognitive endurance. These disturbances may then be followed by disturbances in executive function and self-awareness as injury severity increases. In the behavioral sphere, mood disturbances and disorders of behavioral control and regulation are particularly common.",

      "abstract": "Torticollis is defined by head tilt toward the contractured muscle and chin rotation to the opposite direction, and can lead to secondary problems such as plagiocephaly, scoliosis, delayed cognitive development and impaired balance [Cooperman, 1997]. Torticollises are a common cause of referral to rehabilitation clinics in the pediatric setting. The etiologies of torticollis may be orthopedic, neurologic or ocular. Congenital muscular torticollis due to sternocleidomastoid contracture is the most common type in infants and may be treated with conservative treatment such as muscle stretching. Surgery is recommended in congenital muscular torticollis if conservative treatment is ineffective or if it results in progressive maxillofacial asymmetry [Suhr and Oledzka, 2015]. Other causes are ocular torticollis due to ocular muscle weakness, Sandifer’s syndrome due to gastroesophageal reflux, neural axis abnormalities and benign paroxysmal torticollis. Ocular torticollis usually occurs due to different ophthalmic conditions, including paralytic and restrictive disorders of ocular movement, nystagmus and defects of the visual field [Herman, 2006]. Here we report a missed ocular torticollis in a girl with presumed congenital muscular torticollis.\r\n\r\nCase presentation\r\nA 5-year-old girl with presumed congenital muscular torticollis underwent left sternocleidomastoid muscle-release surgery. As the patient’s symptoms were not improved after surgery, she was referred to a physical medicine and rehabilitation clinic for further physical treatment. The child had left-side head tilt and chin rotation to the right side with normal passive range of motion. There was no facial asymmetry. Musculoskeletal and neurologic evaluations and cervical vertebrae imaging were normal and there was no evidence of muscular mass or shortening in neck muscles. The patient underwent several sessions of physiotherapy, but despite the normal range of motion, head tilt was not corrected. For further evaluations, she was referred to an ophthalmologist. In ocular motility examination, there was right hypertropia and overaction of the right inferior oblique muscle with underaction of the right superior oblique muscle. Visual acuity was 10 out of 10. The patient was diagnosed with congenital right superior oblique palsy and underwent right inferior oblique muscle weakening. In follow-up examination 1 week after surgery, hypertropia was eliminated and head tilt was corrected.",

A series of abnormal reflexes develop (e.g., the plantar reflex) as new synaptic circuits form in the independent cord below the lesion. In some cases, a reflex arc develops and any form of sensory stimulus may cause a massive sympathetic discharge. Most commonly, this reflex is triggered by stretch of a hollow organ like the bowel or bladder. Severe hyperreflexia is common (50–90%) when the spinal injury is above the T6 level, but hyperreflexia may occur when the injury is as low as T10. DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS Immediate Management ...

      "title": "Peripheral Neuropathies",
      "abstract": "Peripheral neuropathy is a common neurological problem and encompasses a variety of functional, anatomical, and pathological disturbances. Patients suffering from chronic pain of neuropathic origin experience worsened health and greater disability than those not suffering from this type of pain. Disorders of the peripheral nervous system, including sensory disturbance, are commonly seen in adults. Peripheral neuropathy has a prevalence of 2.4% in the general population and increases with age to an estimated 8% in those over 55 years of age. Nerve fibers affected by peripheral neuropathy may serve motor, sensory, or autonomic functions; the fibers may be large or small; the distribution of neuropathic involvement may be proximal, distal, or multifocal; and the onset of symptoms may be acute (less than 3 weeks), subacute (3 weeks to 3 months), or chronic (over 3 months). Peripheral neuropathy may occur as a result of several common and many rare diseases, but the most common cause is diabetes. Diseases of the peripheral nervous system may involve muscles (myopathies), nerves (neuropathies, with axons and myelin being affected), and neuromuscular junctions. The subject of peripheral neuropathy; its anatomy; and physiology, classification, evaluation, treatment, and prognosis is an extremely broad topic, and the intent of this chapter is to present a summary review, not an exhaustive analysis of the subject.",

      "title": "Structural Causes of Stupor and Coma",
      "abstract": "Two major classes of structural brain injuries cause coma (Table 3–1): (1) Compressivelesions may impair consciousness either by directly compressing the ascending arousal system or by distorting brain tissue so that it moves out of position and secondarily compresses components of the ascending arousal system or its forebrain targets (see herniation syndromes, page 95). These processes include a wide range of space-occupying lesions such as tumor, hematoma, and abscess. (2) Destructive lesions cause coma by direct damage to the ascending arousal system or its forebrain targets. To cause coma, lesions of the diencephalon or brainstem must be bilateral, but can be quite focal if they damage the ascending activating system near the midline in the midbrain or caudal diencephalon; cortical or subcortical damage must be both bilateral and diffuse. Processes that may cause these changes include tumor, hemorrhage, infarct, trauma, or infection. Both destructive and compressive lesions may cause additional compression by producing brain edema.",

Significantly greater occurrence of aggression was observed in combat veterans with PTSD compared with those without PTSD. There are various types of aggressive behavior that frequently are combined. Autoaggressive (suicidal) and hetero-aggressive (interpersonal violence) behaviors predominate, with dominating verbal aggression and impulsive somatic reactions. Impulsive reactions are more frequently directed toward unknown persons, whereas verbal aggression is mostly aimed at known people. In the occurrence of aggressive behavior in combat veterans with PTSD, important roles are played by education level, low socioeconomic status, maltreatment in childhood, and previous types of violent behavior (before participation in war events).",

      "title": "Semiological Seizure Classification*",
      "abstract": "We propose an epileptic seizure classification based exclusively on ictal semiology. In this semiological seizure classification (SSC), seizures are classified as follows: a. Auras are ictal manifestations having sensory, psychosensory, and experiential symptoms. b. Autonomic seizures are seizures in which the main ictal manifestations are objectively documented autonomic alterations. c. \"Dialeptic\" seizures have as their main ictal manifestations an alteration of consciousness that is independent of ictal EEG manifestations. The new term \"dialeptic\" seizure has been coined to differentiate this concept from absence seizures (dialeptic seizures with a generalized ictal EEG) and complex partial seizures (dialeptic seizures with a focal ictal EEG). d. Motor seizures are characterized mainly by motor symptoms and are subclassified as simple or complex. Simple motor seizures are characterized by simple, unnatural movements that can be elicited by electrical stimulation of the primary and supplementary motor area (myoclonic, tonic, clonic and tonic-clonic, versive). Complex motor seizures are characterized by complex motor movements that resemble natural movements but that occur in an inappropriate setting (\"automatisms\"). e. Special seizures include seizures characterized by \"negative\" features (atonic, astatic, hypomotor, akinetic, and aphasic seizures). The SSC identifies in detail the somatotopic distribution of the ictal semiology as well as the seizure evolution. The advantages of a pure SSC, as opposed to the current classification of the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE), which is actually a classification of electroclinical syndromes, are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder that involves impairment in three broad areas as identified by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition [1]: socialization, communication, and repetitive or restricted behaviors and interests. With regard to socialization, individuals with autism may show limited use of nonverbal behaviors, such as eye contact or facial expressions directed to others. They may demonstrate limited social and emotional reciprocity, may not seek to share their enjoyment of activities and interests with others, and often fail to develop appropriate peer relationships. In the area of communication, individuals with autism may have a significant language delay and have difficulties with symbolic play. Those individuals with strong verbal skills still tend to have communication impairments, including difficulty with reciprocal conversation, and use of unusual or repetitive language. Finally, in the area of restricted and repetitive behaviors, individuals with autism may show a preoccupation with parts of objects (e.g. repeatedly spinning the wheel of a toy car), or an intense preoccupation with an unusual topic of interest (e.g. radiators, train schedules). In some individuals, these areas of interest become almost all-consuming, such that it is difficult for them to relate to others without bringing up their preoccupation. Individuals with autism often show a need for routine and predictability, and may exhibit ritualistic behavior or become upset by disruptions in their usual routine. Finally, some individuals with autism exhibit repetitive movements, such as hand-flapping or body-rocking.",

Seizures starting in the first year of life including the neonatal period might have a favorable course, such as in infants presenting with benign familial neonatal epilepsy, febrile seizures simplex or acute symptomatic seizures. However, in some cases, the onset of seizures at birth or in the first months of life have a dramatic evolution with severe cerebral impairment. Seizure disorders starting in early life include the \"epileptic encephalopathies\", a group of conditions characterized by drug resistant seizures, delayed developmental skills, and intellective disability. This group of disorders includes early infantile epileptic encephalopathy also known as Ohtahara syndrome, early myoclonic encephalopathy, epilepsy of infancy with migrating focal seizures, infantile spasms syndrome (also known as West syndrome), severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy (also known as Dravet syndrome) and, myoclonic encephalopathies in non-progressive disorder. Here we report on seizures manifesting in the first year of life including the neonatal period. Conditions with a benign course, and those with severe evolution are presented. At this early age, clinical identification of seizures, distinction of each of these disorders, type of treatment and prognosis is particularly challenging. The aim of this report is to present the clinical manifestations of each of these disorders and provide an updated review of the conditions associated with seizures in the first year of life.",

This structural difference probably explains why a vestibular tone imbalance in pitch frequently occurs with various intoxications or metabolic disorders. This is unusual for tone imbalance in yaw or roll, unless as a functional decompensation of an earlier (compensated) tone imbalance. Downbeat and upbeat nystagmus are not merely ocular motor disorders, but central vestibular disorders that also affect orientation and balance. A tone imbalance in the pitch plane manifests as vertical upbeating or downbeating nystagmus, fore-aft head-and-body tilt, and deviation of the subjective horizontal toward the direction of the slow phase of the nystagmus.",

Obsessions are intrusive, recurrent, and persistent unwanted thoughts. Compulsions are repetitive behaviors or mental acts that an individual feels driven to perform in response to the obsessions. The heterogeneity of OCD includes themes of obsessions, types of rituals, presence or absence of tics, etiology, genetics, and response to pharmacotherapy. Complications of OCD include interpersonal difficulties, unemployment, substance abuse, criminal justice issues, and physical injuries. Areas of the brain involved in the pathophysiology include the orbitofrontal cortex, anterior cingulate gyrus, and basal ganglia. Overall, OCD may be due to a malfunction in the cortico–striato–thalamo–cortical circuit in the brain. Neurotransmitters implicated in OCD include serotonin, dopamine, and glutamate. Numerous drugs such as atypical antipsychotics and dopaminergic agents can cause or exacerbate OCD symptoms. The etiology includes genetics and neurological insults. Treatment of OCD includes psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, electroconvulsive therapy, transcranial magnetic simulation, and in extreme cases surgery. Exposure and response prevention is the most effective form of psychotherapy. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are the preferred pharmacotherapy. Higher doses than listed in the package insert and a longer trial are often needed for SSRIs than compared to other psychiatric disorders. Alternatives to SSRIs include clomipramine and serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. Treatment of resistant cases includes augmentation with atypical antipsychotics, pindolol, buspirone, and glutamate-blocking agents.",

      "title": "Putting Ocular Neuromyotonia in Context",
      "abstract": "Abnormal spontaneous and evoked muscle activity occurs in neuromyotonia, but the disorder affects the peripheral motor nerves rather than the muscles. The first description in muscle was by Denny-Brown and Foley (1) as “undulating myokymia.” Isaacs (2) demonstrated that the continuous recorded muscle activity was generated by spontaneous activity in the peripheral portion of the motor nerves rather than in the muscles or spinal cord by showing that curare blocked this activity whereas general anesthesia did not. In addition to neuromyotonia, many terms have been applied to this condition, including “armadillo syndrome,” “quantal squander,” “Isaacs syndrome,” and “Merten syndrome.” The continuous muscle activity at rest is usually called “myokymia” and the muscle spasm induced by sustained activation has been called “neuromyotonia,” “impaired muscle relaxation,” and “pseudomyotonia.” At the electrophysiological level, neuromyotonic discharges and myokymia are essentially the same thing except that in the case of neuromyotonia, the firing rates are higher and the amplitude may wane (3). There are many situations in which damaged motor neurons may exhibit these phenomena, now grouped together as “peripheral nerve hyperexcitability” (PNH) disorders, but recent discoveries in autoimmune and genetic conditions have shed light on the underlying pathophysiology. It was known at an early stage that many of these patients had coexisting autoimmune disorders, including thyroid disease and myasthenia gravis. Some of these patients showed improvement with plasma exchange (4), and a radioimmunoassay developed from the green mamba snake toxin detected antibodies against voltage-gated potassium channels (VGKCs) in patients with acquired autoimmune neuromyotonia. Limbic encephalitis can also occur in patients with antibodies to VGKCs without neuromyotonia. However, in 1890, Morvan (5) described as “la chorée fibrillaire” a case in which neuromyotonia and encephalopathy occurred together. Cases of neuromyotonia manifesting insomnia, hallucinations, and behavioral disturbances are sometimes referred to as Morvan syndrome. Mutations in genes encoding VGKC subunits are now known to cause PNH in isolation and in association with episodic ataxias. A very early description of neuromyotonia occurring in an extraocular muscle (the superior oblique) was published by Clark (6), but the term “ocular neuromyotonia” was introduced by Ricker and Mertens (7). Extraocular muscle electromyography established the fact that the induced spasms were neurogenic in origin. Several years ago a patient complaining of intermittent diplopia was referred to me. The referring letter, which came from a senior neurologist who had been one of my teachers, pointed out that the patient appeared to have a mild unilateral third cranial nerve palsy but that during the examination the signs kept changing. I recalled a story told to me in San Francisco in 1990 by another mentor, William F. Hoyt, MD, about a man who, when driving, would see two hoods on his Buick when he moved his eyes back to primary position after looking through the rearview mirror. The patient I was asked to examine intermittently appeared to have a lateral rectus paresis as sustained adduction provoked spasm of the medial rectus. It was this latter phenomenon, not the mild third cranial nerve palsy with synkinesis, that caused his diplopia. I could also explain why his family members reported that occasionally the patient's eye looked “starey” following sustained upgaze when I noted dramatic lid retraction due to spasm of the levator palpebrae superioris. Until that time, all published cases of ocular neuromyotonia had followed radiotherapy. My patient had an aneurysm compressing the third cranial nerve. This case was reported along with two others (8). The second patient, whose case followed radiotherapy, also had signs of a chronic partial third cranial nerve palsy with synkinesis at rest, such that the levator muscle was activated on downgaze (pseudo-von Graefe sign). The third patient, seen by Mr. Michael Sanders, my colleague in neuro-ophthalmology, appeared to have a spasm of the superior oblique muscle. In ocular neuromyotonia, the neuro-ophthalmic manifestations always lessen when the patient is treated with relatively low doses of a membrane-stabilizing agent such as carbamazepine. Not only did the neuromyotonia in our second patient disappear with treatment, but the signs of synkinesis and the chronic partial third nerve palsy also improved. In this issue of the Journal of Neuro-Ophthalmology, Oohira and Furuya (9) describe a patient who also exhibited the association of third cranial nerve synkinesis and neuromyotonia, both regressing spontaneously and in parallel. The authors concluded, as did we (8) and Shults et al (10) that the synkinetic movements and the neuromyotonia may have a common etiology and that the synkinetic movements may not be due entirely to “hard-wired” misdirection. The improvement in the chronic third cranial nerve palsy with carbamazepine treatment in our second patient suggests that the carbamazepine may have alleviated a chronic neuronopathy as well as preventing the spasms. Also in this issue of the Journal, Choi and colleagues (11) present an idiopathic case of third cranial nerve synkinesis and neuromyotonia. They use the term “aberrant regeneration” which, unlike the term “synkinesis,” implies an unverified pathophysiology. These authors also found that both the neuromyotonia and the signs of aberrant regeneration (lid retraction on downgaze) improved when the patient was treated with carbamazepine. It is difficult to understand why any medication would have an impact on hard-wired anomalous innervation. Yet not all cases of ocular neuromyotonia show synkinetic phenomena and not all cases of synkinesis show neuromyotonic phenomena. Consider the following parsimonious hypothesis. Misdirected neurons have been damaged and undergo Wallerian degeneration. This process becomes arrested at some point and a new axon or axons have sprouted and succeeded in reinnervating an ocular muscle-the wrong one. A nerve with damaged but surviving neurons has the potential to exhibit neuromyotonic phenomena. This association may be more common than has been reported. Most patients with third cranial nerve neuromyotonia who I have examined have shown synkinetic as well as neuromyotonic phenomena. Perhaps there is a hard-wired hard core of genuine misdirection that will always persist, but these neurons are also liable to generate ephaptic transmission, which may be responsible for amplification of synkinetic movements. Such amplification would be readily attenuated by carbamazepine. An interesting question is whether the persistent activation is limited to the muscle that has undergone sustained activity or whether it spreads to other muscles. Oohira and Furuya (9) also note involuntary eye closure in their patient at the onset of the spasm. This phenomenon is difficult to relate to the proposed schema, and I wonder whether it occurred to avoid diplopia (12). Neuromyotonia is now explained physiologically as a disorder of cell membrane potassium channels, such that the axon can no longer maintain membrane stability. At rest this gives rise to myokymia. During sustained muscle activity, extracellular potassium accumulates and provokes neuromyotonic discharges. In the past, demyelination was proposed as the pathophysiologic basis of ocular neuromyotonia, but I do not think that this is very likely, at least not without contributions from other factors. Demyelination is not present in most causes of PNH. Furthermore, the condition in which demyelination and remyelination occurs most frequently in the ocular motor nerves is microvascular ischemic palsy, yet these patients never develop neuromyotonia. Radiotherapy is the most common cause of ocular neuromyotonia (50% of cases reported), and it is well known that in cases of post-irradiation plexopathy, myokymic and neuromyotonic discharges are seen in 80%, a finding used to attribute progression to irradiation rather than recurrent malignancy. The parallels between PNH disorders and ocular neuromyotonia are clear, but there are differences. Myokymia and neuromyotonia are almost always found together in peripheral nerve disorders, yet in the extraocular muscles we encounter two rather distinct syndromes: myokymia affecting only the superior oblique and neuromyotonia affecting any of the extraocular muscles. In his Elegy to Sir Philip Sidney, the Elizabethan poet Matthew Roydon wrote: I trow that countenance cannot lie, Whose thoughts are legible in the eye. The eyes can tell us more than a person's thoughts. Ocular neuromyotonia exemplifies what we can read about disease processes-if we know the language. The “countenance cannot lie,” but the observer can fail to comprehend.",

      "title": "The Effect of a Music and Movement Program on Gait, Balance and Psychological Parameters of Adults with Cerebral Palsy",
      "abstract": "IntroductionCerebral palsy (CP) is a non-progressive disorder occurring in early brain development that results in abnormal movement and posture (Rosenbaum et al., 2007). The main features of participants with CP are impaired movement and posture that involves gait and upper body coordination as well as problems with balance and psychological problems such as negative emotional image and low self-esteem (Fairhurst, 2012; Graham & Selber, 2003; Krigger, 2006; Murphy & Such-Neibar, 2003; Reddihough & Collins, 2003; Rapp & Torres, 2000; Sandstrom, 2007; Steenbergen & Utley, 2005). Spastic Hemiplegia (SH) is type of CP that affects partially or totally only one half molecule of the body and common problems for those with SH include motor difficulties, such as small stride length, asymmetric walking, slowness, and reduced ability to coordinate movements, which affects the posture and walking as well as symmetrical proper use of the trunk and upper-extremity (Boyd et al., 2010; Kulak & Sobaniec, 2005; Motta, Antonello, & Stignani, 2011; Staudt et al., 2004; van der Slot et al., 2007; Willis, Morello, Davie, Rice, & Bennett, 2002).Studies showed that people with CP due to difficulties in physical and mental function, social support and other features have difficulty with rhythmic perception, rhythmic performance of movement and responsiveness rhythmic auditory stimuli (Kwak & Kim, 2013; McRorie & Cooper, 2004). The difficulty of understanding rhythmic sounds restricts the efficiency of movement and creates psychological distress, with consistent tendency for isolation and negative emotions towards familiar environment and self (Manuel, Naughton, Balkrishnan, Paterson-Smith, & Koman, 2003; Shields, Murdoch, Loy, Dodd, & Taylor, 2006).In intervention studies involving persons with mobility limitation it was observed that the use of music and rhythm programs activated the motor and auditory system and consistently, improved balance, walking and mental health conditions (Jeong & Kim, 2007; Kim et al., 2011). Moreover, it seemed to be of significant benefit as regards to coordination of movements and at the same time, improvement of gross and fine motor skills, enhancement of tactile sensation and improvement of emotional and social development, especially in the case individuals with CP participated in music and motor activities basically designed on the theory of rhythmic auditory stimulation (Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation-RAS) (Chung, 2002; Farrell, Bagley, Davids, Foti, & Moore, 1999; Jiang, 2013; Kim et al., 2011; Kim, Kwak, Park, & Cho, 2012; Kwak, 2007; Kwak & Kim, 2013; Thaut, Hurt, Dragon, & Mcintosh, 1998; Varsamis, Staikopoulos, & Kartasidou, 2012).Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation (RAS) is neurologic technique using the physiological effects of auditory rhythm on the motor system to improve the control of movement in rehabilitation and therapy (Thaut, 2005, p. 139). Rhythm is an essential element of motor movement including motor control and output (Molinari, Leggio, De Martin, Cerasa, & Thaut, 2003), since rhythmic auditory cuing facilitates movement by providing a mechanism for planning movements (Thaut et al., 2007). It has been reported that intervention programs based on RAS method may improve upper and lower extremity function and gait in terms of velocity, stride length and rhythm (Abbud, Li, & De Mont, 2009; Amatachaya, Keawsutthi, Amatachaya, & Manimmanakorn, 2009; Kim et al., 2007; Richards, Senesac, Davis, Woodbury, & Nadeau, 2008; Thaut et al., 2007), as well as psychological stress parameters such as depression, anger, wellness and quality of life to people with various kinds of neurologic diseases (Hayashi, Nagaoka, & Mizuno, 2006; Jeong & Kim, 2007; Pacchetti et al., 2000).Previous researchers have incorporated music components into rehabilitation exercise programs as a means of motivating stroke patients and adding a fun component to the repetitive and sometimes painful rehabilitation exercise routines (Kim & Koh, 2005; Purdie, Hamilton, & Baldwin, 1997). …",

The autonomic nervous system plays a major role in both nausea and vomiting. Visceral afferents, principally in the abdominal vagus, provide one of the most important triggers for their induction. The nucleus tractus solitarius in the brainstem is one of the main nuclei involved in processing visceral afferent information and serves to integrate many of the reflex motor events constituting vomiting. The autonomic motor nuclei in the brainstem (e.g. dorsal motor vagal nucleus, nucleus ambiguus, the presympathetic neurons), thoracolumbar and sacral spinal cord are all involved to varying degrees in generating the physiological events accompanying nausea and the motor components of vomiting. The hypothalamic–pituitary axis is involved in the endocrine changes associated with nausea and ‘higher’ brain regions are implicated in the emotional (e.g. amygdala) and sensory experiences (insula)....",

      "title": "Early identification and intervention for infants at high risk of neurodevelopmental disorders",
      "abstract": "Developmental disability is a broad term encompassing many different diagnoses. These conditions, predominantly associated with the functioning of the neurological system and brain, manifest during infancy or childhood and usually last throughout a person’s lifetime. These are marked by delayed development or functional limitations in cognition, language, communication, behavior socialization or motor function, and are defined as ‘neurodevelopmental disorders’. \r\nMost neurodevelopmental disorders are caused by a complex mix of factors, that may affect neurological function. This might be due to genetics, due to conditions occurring during pregnancy, such as malnutrition, infection or parental behavior (i.e. smoking, drugs and/or drinking alcohol during pregnancy,…) or due to perinatal and neonatal complications. \r\nNeurodevelopmental problems due to injury that has occurred during the perinatal period can mainly be subdivided in 3 groups:\r\n-\tInfants with congenital malformations, including syndromes, chromosomal and genetic defects and inborn errors of metabolism\r\n-\tInfants that are born preterm and/or with low birthweight\r\n-\tInfants with a hypoxic-ischemic insult and/or perinatal stroke \r\n\r\nThis doctoral thesis focused on preterm birth and perinatal stroke, two main perinatal causes of neurodevelopmental disorders and improved our insight about the neurodevelopmental outcome, early diagnosis and early intervention of those high-risk infants. \r\n\r\nPART I of this dissertation focused on very preterm (VPT)/very-low-birthweight (VLBW) infants. The care for preterm infants has improved considerably in the last decades, however, they continue to face complex medical and neurodevelopmental problems. In the last few decades preterm births increased and the survival of VPT/VLBW have improved, however this is not accompanied by increased morbidity. Although most preterm born infants do not develop major impairments, they are at higher risk to develop cerebral palsy (CP), motor and/or cognitive impairments and the risk increases with decreasing gestational age (GA) and birthweight (BW). Recent actual mortality, morbidity and neurodevelopmental outcome rates among VPT/VLBW infants is essential for family counseling and evaluation of innovative approaches to enhance outcomes.\r\nThe first part of this dissertation comprises two chapters, providing an overview of the current prevalences of neurodevelopmental impairment, globally as well as for our local population. In chapter 1, existing literature regarding the overall neurodevelopmental outcome at two years corrected age in VLB/VLBW infants born over the last decade was reviewed and reported in a meta-analytic review. In chapter 2, the neonatal mortality and neurodevelopmental outcome in a national population-based cohort was investigated. \r\n\r\nPART II of this dissertation focused on infants with perinatal stroke. Perinatal stroke might not be as common as preterm birth, it is still an important group of infants because it is know that more than quart of the children with perinatal results in neurological deficits, however the exact number varies considerably between studies. Early detection and referral of infants at risk for intervention, rather than referral children with known CP has been called for. Nonetheless, this requires careful monitoring in the first months of development and appropriate early diagnostic tools. The literature on established and experimental approaches for the treatment of upper limb function unilateral spastic CP (USCP) in older children is comprehensive, however, in young infants this remain practically unexplored, despite evidence of a critical time limit for activity-dependent plasticity to influence the corticospinal tract development during the first years of life. Given the shortage of early intervention studies, very little is known about the feasibility of such intervention programs in very young infants. \r\nPart II is composed of two chapters, describing two original research articles. In chapter 3, the neurological outcome was for each specific type of stroke lesion reported in infants with perinatal stroke as well as the predictability of two motor evaluation tools (‘General movement assessment [GMA]’ and the ‘Hand assessment for infants [HAI]’) for early detection of USCP. Lastly, in chapter 4, a study was undertaken in infants with perinatal stroke at high risk of USCP to investigate the feasibility of a parent-delivered home-based early intervention program, comparing two therapy approaches, namely ‘Constraint-induced movement therapy (baby-CIMT)’ and ‘hand–arm bimanual training (baby-HABIT)’ and to address potential obstacles for further implementation. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, this dissertation provided some useful insight on the outcome of those high-risk infants as well as some newfound knowledge about early predictions tools and early intervention for infants with perinatal stroke. However, more research is needed in order to fully understand the impact of very preterm birth and perinatal stroke on the longer term and how early diagnosis and early intervention can be improved in high-risk infants.",

      "abstract": "Mobbing is a topic that has gained an increasing importance, due to escalating numbers of cases that are reported and go back to courts. This phenomenon may be characterised as a set of intimidating, humiliating or embarrassing, harmful or unwanted conducts of various kinds, occurring in the context of an employment relationship, that objectively violate the fundamental rights of the worker, namely, his dignity and physical and moral integrity (Pereira, 2009, p. 72). Moreover, a systematization of these behaviours is demanded: the repetition of the offensive conduct, which should be extended in time, but also the combination of several acts that complement each other in achieving the purpose it was intended1. Therefore, mobbing may cause damage to the physical and psychological health of workers2. Indeed, it is responsible for cognitive, psychological, psychosomatic and hormonal changes, as regards the nervous system, muscle tension and sleep, and may ultimately lead to suicide.

      "title": "Spastic Paresis: A Treatable Movement Disorder",
      "abstract": "If a movement disorder is a neurological condition that causes \"excess movement or a paucity of voluntary and involuntary movements,\" we propose that spastic paresis represents an archetypical movement disorder and should be considered within this sphere.1 This relates not only to the sign of spasticity, which is defined as the enhancement of velocity-dependent stretch reflexes, measured at rest.2, 3 Spasticity is but the symptomatic hallmark of the syndrome of spastic paresis following lesions that involve pyramidal pathways. Spastic paresis comprises hypokinetic and hyperkinetic movement abnormalities from both muscular and neural causes, which constitute the spastic movement disorder (SMD).1 When considering brain lesions causing syndromes of spastic paresis (eg, stroke, trauma, tumors, inflammatory, or infectious brain disorders), the vast majority are not confined to the pathways of motor command execution, that is the pyramidal pathways. In most cases, neural damage extends to striatal-cortical areas involved in the preparation of motor command, which are extrapyramidal pathways. In some instances, causal lesions even include pathways involved in the conception or the motivation of motor command, causing superimposed symptoms of apraxia or abulia. Even when considering strictly spinal cord injuries, we suggest that the syndromes resulting from those lesions also represent true movement disorders, with hypokinetic and hyperkinetic components. Disruption of motor command execution causes paresis, that is, reduced voluntary motor unit recruitment.4 The resulting signs include insufficient movement acceleration or force.4 A paucity of movement ensues with low amplitude and speed. Paresis of the agonist is the only operative mechanism in the hyperacute stages of paresis. In subacute and chronic stages, agonist paresis becomes combined with increased antagonistic resistances, with muscle and then additional neural impairments, which also contribute to the hypokinetic movement disorder. The individualization of a muscle disorder because of immobilization in unstretched position in the context of paresis is relatively recent. Following stroke, lesion load in the brain and reduced active movement at 48 hours predict later hyper-resistance to stretch from some muscles, with risks of limb deformities and pressure sores.5-8 In his volume Internal Affections, Hippocrates emphasized the need to frequently mobilize the bed-ridden patient—regardless of brain lesion—and the poor prognosis of movement loss from insufficient mobilization.9 In the late 18th century, the anatomist Vicq d'Azyr reported fatty transformation inside immobilized muscles, the outside aspect of the muscle being unchanged.10 The concept of a condition later called disuse atrophy was born, with early measures showing reduction of muscle mass, but no report at the time on muscle extensibility changes.11 It was not immediately understood that disuse in the stretched position was partly protective for the muscle.11 Muscle extensibility may be defined as the amount of muscle lengthening obtained for a given stretching force.1, 4 The first animal studies specifically monitoring muscle extensibility after muscle immobilization in unstretched position were performed in the 1970s.12, 13 Within days of immobilization in unstretched position, muscle extensibility decreases in parallel with sarcomere loss.12-15 From a pathogenetic point of view, these muscle changes are initiated by profound modifications in gene transcription, with falling protein synthesis within 2 hours of the unstretched immobilization onset.16, 17 In parallel, centro-nucleation occurs within the diseased muscle fiber.18, 19 Surrounding collagen bundles stiffen, forming a modified muscle extracellular matrix (ECM) with thickened perimysial cables, enhanced collagen cross-links in endomysium, causing major losses of extensibility.15, 18-20 Of note, associated neurotomy or radicotomy partially protect the unstretched muscle from these changes.11, 13 Central neurophysiological consequences emerge later as any stretching forces are more readily transmitted through stiffer muscles, causing spindle stimulation enhancement and excitatory afferent bombardment that will later tend to increase motor neuronal excitability (see below).21 The bed rest that is generally prescribed in the setting of severe acute lesions of brain or spinal cord pathways induces sensori-motor restriction22 and leaves some muscles (eg, shoulder and knee extensors and plantar flexors) unused, but most importantly unstretched, that is immobilized in the short position.23 In the context of severe paresis of descending origin, no compensatory movement occurs, no peripheral nerve lesion preserves from these pathological muscle changes and muscle vulnerability to unstretched immobilization is maximal. Therefore, within the generic concept of disuse atrophy, a specific unstretched muscle stiffening is acutely operative for those muscles left in short, unstretched position in the context of paresis.12-15 Yet, this early evolving muscle disorder has long remained referred to as secondary muscle changes in the literature on spastic paresis, suggesting that these would be mere consequences of motor neuronal overactivity.1, 5 However, the acute muscle changes described above actually precede the emergence of spasticity or any other form of overactivity24; it is unfortunate that they will indeed be further exacerbated by the later emergence of motor neuronal overactivity.2, 25 In spastic paresis, rapidly developing muscle alterations and later emerging forms of motor neuronal overactivity eventually potentiate each other,21, 25, 26 therefore, the term spastic myopathy was coined to characterize the muscle disorder.27 Spastic myopathy increasingly contributes to movement reduction in subacute and chronic stages of spastic paresis.1, 4, 26 Importantly, spastic myopathy is genetically and biomechanically treatable by remobilization, that is by muscle stretch, particularly if applied early following the onset of unstretched immobilization.12, 14, 16, 17, 28 In the weeks following the onset of paresis and the development of spastic myopathy, plastic neural mechanisms occur, whereby stretch-sensitive muscle overactivity emerges to cause a third, general mechanism aggravating hypokinesis.1, 2, 5 Following damage to corticospinal pathways, there are alterations in spinal circuitry and increased involvement of diffusely projecting excitatory brainstem motor pathways together with aberrant sprouting onto motoneuronal membranes at each segmental level (see neurophysiological mechanisms below).1, 2, 29 Among the resulting forms of motor neuronal overactivity, a specific impairment of motor command deserves specific mention for its capacity to worsen movement hypokinesis and for its high degree of associated-disability. Spastic co-contraction, an antagonistic co-activation first noted by Nothnagel in the 19th century,30 has been defined as a misdirection of the volitional supraspinal drive during agonist command, which abnormally recruits antagonist motor units.2, 30, 31 In spastic co-contraction, abnormal antagonist recruitment occurs regardless of any stretch (or of any peripheral stimulation, ie, this is not a reflex) but is enhanced by stretch, hence the term spastic co-contraction.2, 30, 31 This form of overactivity directly impedes, and may sometimes reverse the desired voluntary movement, therefore, contributing to the hypokinetic component of the spastic movement disorder.30, 31 A number of other hyperkinetic movement abnormalities gradually emerge in spastic paresis. Spastic dystonia is a phenomenon observed at rest, first described and named by Denny-Brown following ablations of various areas of motor and premotor cortices in monkeys.32 This is another important form of motoneuronal overactivity, defined as an unwanted, prolonged, involuntary muscle activation at rest, in the absence of stretch or voluntary effort.32, 33 However, its level of severity is also impacted by how much tension is applied on the dystonic muscle.33 Spastic dystonia causes abnormal posturing with gradually increasing deformities.32, 33 Extra-segmental co-contractions are common in spastic paresis. They are known as synkinesis, dyssynergias, or associated reactions.29 Synkinesis has also been related to increased involvement of diffusely projecting excitatory brainstem motor pathways.29 Spasms are defined as sudden and brief involuntary muscle contractions at rest, related in particular to motor neuronal hyperexcitability34; they particularly develop following spinal cord lesions. Clonus is another form of hyperkinesis that may become troublesome in functional situations, in the context of severe spasticity that is major enhancement of stretch reflexes.1, 2, 33, 34 Spastic dystonia, synkinesis, spasms, and clonus increasingly become disabling and highly visible hyperkinetic components of the spastic movement disorder. Understanding the exact mechanisms of lesion-induced plasticity underlying the phenomena described above faces the fundamental challenge of connecting two fields: that of animal research—with data most often obtained from small quadrupedal animals—characterized by direct neurophysiological or ultrastructural investigation techniques, but usually rudimentary clinical analysis, and that of human research with opposite characteristics, in which disentanglement between the clinical phenomena of spastic paresis may be relatively advanced today, but where only indirect physiological investigations can be carried out, precluding direct demonstration of causal relationships between basic mechanisms and clinical events.34 In addition, the putative mechanisms mentioned below may be themselves causally related to one another. As a consequence, what follows are mostly hypotheses, which can be appreciated by their smaller or greater likelihood. These hypotheses may be classified into spinal and supraspinal mechanisms. In the months that follow a higher neural injury, neuronal circuits distal to the injury adapt to sudden disfacilitation and inactivity by mostly increasing intrinsic excitability. The time course of excitability recovery is increasingly protracted from simple to complex nervous systems, from frogs to small rodents to humans.35 At the spinal level, plastic changes that potentially contribute to spasticity, spastic dystonia, and spasms in humans include the recovery of mono-amine sensitive persistent inward currents (PICs) contributing to plateau potentials in α motoneurons,35-37 enhanced secondary spindle stimulation by stretch transmitted through stiffer muscles and increased facilitatory group II effects on the lower limb extensors,21, 38, 39 decreased presynaptic inhibition on Ia afferents,40-43 decreased homosynaptic depression,43-48 and decreased Ib inhibition.49-51 The spinal mechanisms that potentially contribute to spastic cocontractions are increased Renshaw inhibition and decreased Ia reciprocal inhibition during effort.52-55 As far as potentially increased input from γ motor neurons, this has not been confirmed in human studies that have used microneurography Ia recordings from nerves to non-shortened muscles only, such as the radial nerve in the upper limb and the peroneal nerve in the lower limb.56-58 Excitatory brainstem descending pathways such as the rubrospinal, vestibulospinal, and medial reticulo-propriospinal pathways, are phylogenetically older and characterized by more diffuse motor command and lesser capacity for rest than the corticospinal pathway.59-63 For the past few decades, studies after unilateral pyramidotomy or spinal hemisection in rodents have demonstrated plastic adaptive sprouting to motor neurons or to facilitatory interneurons—along group II pathways in particular—from excitatory brainstem descending pathways or from the contralesional cortex including with mid-line crossing axons and cues guiding and/or stabilizing newly formed sprouts in the adult, denervated spinal cord.59-63 Molecular changes in the spinal cord of stroke-affected corticospinal tracts comprise an early inflammatory phase with activated microglia in the target area of reinnervating corticospinal motor neurons and a late phase with upregulation of growth-promoting factors, which can influence sprouting response, arborization, and synapse formation, particularly from the contralesional motor cortex.63 Consistent findings have been obtained in human patients.29, 64 In some reviews, it has been suggested that suppression of descending inhibitions could contribute to motoneuronal overactivity in spastic paresis.65-67 Few inhibitory brainstem descending pathways, in particular the dorso-lateral reticulospinal pathway, may indeed exert inhibitory actions on stretch reflexes, as indicated in classic studies by Magoun, then by Lance in intact animals, showing that electrical stimulation of the medial medullary reticular formation indeed inhibits flexor and extensor as well as tonic vibration reflexes.68-70 However, the hypothesis that \"spasticity\" could emerge because of lesion-induced suppression of these inhibitory inputs from the corticoreticular pathways is more questionable. These assumptions rarely take the issue of time course into account. After the initial state of areflexia that follows a brain or a spinal cord lesion,71 the time course of reflex enhancements in humans is slower than in animals and protracted over weeks or months after most lesions,72 which points to a gradual, plastic phenomenon of sprouting and synaptic formation, as opposed to a lesion-induced disinhibition event.34 Beyond a certain threshold of severity, muscle shortening and stiffening on one side of each joint may \"drive\" impairments by tonically increasing excitatory spindle afferent activity to the homonymous motoneuron.2, 21 Such reverse muscle-central nervous system action might occur through synaptic sensitization at the spinal level by chronically increased intramuscular tension and, therefore, intensified muscle afferent firing.21, 73 On the side of the shortened and stiffened muscle, motoneuronal hyperexcitability may in turn enhance activation of that muscle, promoting phenomena such as spastic dystonia, synkinesis (causes of hyperkinesis), and spastic cocontraction (cause of hypokinesis). On the opposite side, chronic mechanisms of reciprocal inhibition from the more stiffened muscle may worsen paresis.74 In spastic paresis, all of the phenomena reviewed above—paresis, muscle stiffening, spastic co-contraction, synkinesis, spastic dystonia, and spasms—all coalesce to constitute a composite hypokinetic and hyperkinetic spastic movement disorder, asymmetric around joints, causing cosmetic and functional limitations.75 Classical teaching generally suggests that movement disorders are solely associated with dysfunction of non-pyramidal systems. However, we suggest that the concepts reviewed here provide further insight into the extent and complexity of the mixed hypokinetic and hyperkinetic movement disorder of spastic paresis. In practice, patients at risk (ie, with severe initial paresis) should be identified early and considered for multi-modal programs, involving wearable movement sensors and robotic, physical, medical, or surgical tools including blocking agents such as botulinum toxin, or procedures such as neuro-/radicotomies.6-8, 76 Among the physical strategies, alternating movement exercises reduce stretch reflexes and cocontractions in short-term studies.48, 77 As reviewed above, other techniques such as prolonged muscle remobilization (ie, long-term stretch programs) may partially reverse spastic myopathy, particularly if commenced early.12, 14, 16, 17, 28 Guided self-rehabilitation contracts combining chronic self-stretch and maximal alternating efforts have shown efficacy over the long term in controlled studies.78 We hope to have provided convincing arguments to support that spastic paresis is a movement disorder because it fits twice into the definition, being a neurological condition that causes both \"excess movement\" and \"a paucity of voluntary and involuntary movements.\" We also briefly appraised the large number of potential therapeutic avenues for these patients. It is notable that study and care of patients with spastic paresis were predominantly conducted by neurologists until the 1960s when the emerging rehabilitation medicine gradually took ownership of the domain. Following the concept of the International Medical Society for Motor Disturbances (ISMD), a parent organization of the Movement Disorders Society (MDS),79 the MDS Spasticity Study Group was founded, involving neurorehabilitation specialists, movement disorders neurologists, neurophysiologists, and biomechanical engineers. We join in this collaborative group, animated by the commitment to exploring novel approaches to investigate, diagnose, and treat the spastic movement disorder. There is a logical synergy between these efforts and ongoing MDS teaching activities, on botulinum toxin therapy in particular. We also believe that the \"Movement Disorders expertise\" may prove precious in conjunction with the physiatry care of patients with this condition, and that it would be both a challenging and rewarding strategy for part of the Movement Disorders community to tackle again the complexity of the syndrome of spastic paresis.

      "abstract": "Abstract An important characteristic of modern mental health practice is the variety of ways in which mental distress and disorder are understood (Colombo 1997). These ‘models of disorder’ range along a spectrum from medical (or biological) conceptions of mental illness (according to which mental disorders are caused by distinct pathological lesions in the brain and hence are no different in prin ciple from bodily illnesses), through various psychological models (for exam ple, behavioural, psychoanalytic, family dynamic), to overtly moral models. According to the latter, mental disorders are, in one way or another, either problems of living for which those concerned are responsible, or labels imposed by society to justify the control of deviance.",

      "abstract": "Polyneuropathies can be classified according to etiology, symptoms, time course, and prognosis. Peripheral nerves contain motor, sensory, and autonomic fibers. Composite functions depend on their integrity. The evaluation of individual functions is often difficult, because different types of neuropathies require measurement with different scales and scores. Even for similar types of neuropathies, a variety of scales are used. Contrary to mononeuropathies, where the steps of recovery and the influence of rehabilitation have been well studied, concepts for neurorehabilitation of neuropathies are vague. Analogous to the concepts used in mononeuropathies, (1) reversibility similar to neurapraxia, (2) reinnervation after complete or partial lesions, or (3) permanent loss of peripheral nerve function, with or without progression, are seen. Prior to rehabilitation, a careful analysis of motor, sensory, autonomic, and composite functions, as well as additional features such as pain, gait, and posture and secondary effects such as ulcers or bone deformity, quality of life, psychological aspects, communication, fatigue, and social context, is essential. Recent years have shown increasing awareness of neuroplasticity as a central mechanism to compensate for peripheral deficits. Injury to peripheral nerves triggers an acute mechanism that alters maps at multiple subcortical and cortical levels. Selective amplification of neuroplasticity could be a future aspect of neurorehabilitation.",

      "abstract": "Sometimes concussion is accompanied by an abrupt change in behavior, including psychosis or dementia, but concussion is not necessarily the cause. It is more likely that head injury can sometimes unmask an underlying predisposition to another neuropsychiatric disease that has already begun to manifest, often sub-clinically. Such unmasking may occur as a result of a brain injury superimposed on an already vulnerable brain, or a brain injury that contextually removes the individual from a routine that served as a reliable and dependable structural context. Thus, when abrupt neuropsychiatric manifestations such as psychosis or dementia manifest after concussion, a thorough neuropsychiatric evaluation should be performed, and one should not simply assume that concussion is the cause.",

General notes on Tinnitus: 1- Any Tinnitus treatment must be used in connection with counseling and possible other treatment. 2- Tinnitus is a perception of involuntary sound. It must be audible to the person, it originates in the head (McFadden 1982). 3- It is most commonly referred to as ringing in the ears. 4- Produced centrally, with peripheral influences (e.g. Cochlear damage). Exact mechanism(s), or epidemiology is unknown. 5- Noise type can vary from pure tones over modulated noise to crackling sounds that varies significantly with time &amp; Large intensity variations. 6- Not a ‘phantom’ perception for the patient, it is real 7- Tinnitus can be described in many different forms, for example: Ringing, Chirping, Clicking, Pulsating, Continuous, Sudden A-Geriatric tinnitus Presby tinnitus, defined as tinnitus that accompanies the progressive hearing loss of presbycusis; is classified as: type 1 (normal aging affecting the cochlea), and type II (preexistent sensorineural hearing loss accompanied by multiple systemic complaints, especially of sensory ones). B-Pediatric tinnitus has an incidence of 13% in children who passed an audio metric screening test, and 23-60% in those with hearing loss, 44% in secretory otitis media, but only 3% complain spontaneously because that the child considers tinnitus to be a normal event. There is no significant difference between children with tinnitus and those without in terms of hearing level, age, gender, or etiology of the deafness. Despite the fact that often children do not mention it, tinnitus may incite behavioral problems.",

      "title": "Hypnotism",
      "abstract": "Hypnotism is but one of several names that may be applied to a closely related range of ostensibly abnormal mental states associated for the most part with altered consciousness and the apparent abnegation of will. These analogous states include mental abstraction, lucid dreaming, induced trance (or deep relaxation), voluntary or induced somnambulism (commonly called sleepwalking), and certain varieties of catalepsy and epilepsy. When deployed within Gothic fiction, these states are usually enhanced further through a customary (though scientifically dubious) association with occult phenomena such as prescience and clairvoyance, and with suggestions of personal and sexual violations of the entranced self, the origins of which can be traced to the earliest days of systematic hypnotism in Europe.",

(2) Synchronous myoclonus in muscles innervated by the same spinal segments of one body side, asynchronous myoclonus in muscles of different segments as well as in contralateral muscles of the same segments. (3) Usually stable frequency, which may increase to a manifold under the influence of different stimuli. (4) Accentuation of the myoclonus under mental distress, disappearance during deeper sleep.

      "abstract": "Abstract Writer's cramp is a disorder characterized by involuntary and excessive contraction of the muscles of the upper limb (especially those of the hand and forearm) on attempting to write. This results in impaired writing and abnormal posturing of the hand, forearm, or upper arm. In simple writer's cramp these features are present in isolation, whereas in dystonic writer's cramp dystonic posturing of the limb occurs at other times, particularly when using it to perform manual tasks. Sometimes simple writer's cramp develops into dystonic writer's cramp and this transition has been called progressive writer's cramp (Sheehy and Marsden 1982). Writer's cramp may occur as part of generalized dystonia and may either proceed or follow other dystonic features. It may just spread to involve the neck or opposite upper limb and thus become a segmental dystonia. The former is more likely with childhood onset, whereas the latter is more frequent with adult onset.",

      "title": "Hipotonia e função respiratória em crianças com Transtorno do Espectro Autista: uma revisão sistemática",
      "abstract": "O Transtorno do Espectro Autista (TEA) é estudado há mais de 60 anos. Hoje é classificado pelo Diagnostical and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V) como um transtorno de desenvolvimento que interfere na interação social de comunicação, podendo apresentar alterações motoras e posturais. Suas manifestações variam de acordo com o desenvolvimento e idade cronológica de cada criança. Essas alterações interferem no desenvolvimento e podem acarretar prejuízos posturais (desvio postural), déficit de equilíbrio, alteração na coordenação motora fina e grossa, hipotonia (HP) e movimentos estereotipados, que impactam a capacidade funcional do indivíduo. No que diz respeito à HP, a principal característica é a dificuldade de controle postural e do tônus. Nesse sentido, ao correlacionar a HP com o sistema respiratório, é importante observar que, se houver a presença da HP e, ou, fraqueza da musculatura respiratória associada à alteração muscular da caixa torácica, podem ocorrer alterações na ventilação pulmonar, tosse ineficaz, dificuldade na deglutição, sialorreia em excesso e infecções respiratórias recorrentes e processos alérgicos. Entretanto, não é fácil estabelecer relação sob a HP e o TEA nas alterações respiratórias devido à escassez de artigos na literatura. É nesse contexto que este estudo objetivou investigar as influências da hipotonia no TEA sobre o sistema respiratório. Uma revisão sistemática foi realizada com base em duas buscas separadas a partir das cominações dos termos, em inglês: Autism Spectrum Disorder, Autistic Disorder, Autismo, Muscle Hypotononia, Respiratory System Respiratory Tract Diseases, associados pelo operador booleano ‘‘AND’’ e ‘‘OR’’. A primeira busca seguiu esta ordem: ‘‘Respiratory system OR respiratory tract diseases AND muscle hypotonia OR hypotonia’’; a segunda busca seguiu: ‘‘Autism spectrum disorder OR autistic disorder OR austism AND muscle hypotonia OR hypotonia’’. Os resultados evidenciaram que não foram encontrados estudos sobre TEA que abordassem e, ou, avaliassem o sistema respiratório. Dessa forma, ao correlacionar os achados das duasbuscas a partir do objetivo proposto e dos estudos analisados, esta revisão sistemática pressupôs que existe influência da HP no sistema respiratório e, possivelmente, em indivíduos com TEA. As questões relacionadas à HP no TEA já são descritas como presentes na literatura, entretanto não se encontram estudos que discutam a HP no sistema respiratório desses indivíduos. Há indícios de que a HP, ao acometer a região de tronco e estruturas próximas, leva à alteração da mecânica respiratória, favorecendo infecções recorrentes e exercendo um peso importante nas análises encontradas e que devem ser consideradas. Entretanto, as estruturas de buscas e os resultados reportados, atualmente, mostram-se ainda insuficientes para o estabelecimento de conclusões concretas. Assim, observa-se a necessidade de novos estudos abordando a avaliação respiratória em indivíduos com TEA com a presença de HP, levando a novas e aprimoradas linhas de pesquisa na área.

      "abstract": "Symptoms specific to schizophrenia include self-disturbances, delusional perception and loosening of associations. Self-disturbances in schizophrenia can be explained from the standpoint of an abnormal sense of agency, such as thought broadcasting as an over-attribution of agency and thought insertion as an under-attribution of agency. Delusional perception is often accompanied by impairment of perceptual organization; delusional mood and delusions might result from the reorganization of the fragmented perceptual field, as well as a loss of reality. Impairment of perceptual organization is frequently related to the loosening of associations.",

The concept of psychic regression, initiated and driven by a motivation loss, requires a reassessment of the family links and of the patients-carers relationships. The relative part of conative depression, dysexecutive syndrome, and psychic regression is difficult to assess in old subjects on account of the complexity of the involved mechanisms (psychological aging, affective and relational history of the subject, family and environmental interactions). Lack of motivation and social dependency in old people result from a failure of the psychological mechanism of elaboration. We present a phenomenological point of view and advance some propositions for their prevention. Loss of motivation appears to be an acquired and dynamic process resulting from the psychological difficulties experienced by the individual due to the loss of autonomy and an increasing dependency which is not accepted although, paradoxically, searched for. This ambivalence results in loss of motivation and psychic regression which belongs to the non cognitive disorders of elderly people.",

      "abstract": "Abstract An intricate pattern of stimulation is generated when a rotating individual tilts his head about an axis that is not parallel to the axis of rotation. His semicircular canals undergo cross-coupled angular accelerations, and his head and otolith organs are exposed to a Coriolis force. Such head movements elicit nystagmus, motion sickness symptoms, and disorientation. The disorientation has two major components: during the head movement, the individual will misperceive the actual trajectory of his head in relation to his torso, and for some time afterward, he will have a confusing illusion that his whole body is rotating. If an individual seated at the center of the platform rotating counterclockwise at constant angular velocity tilts his head backward, then his yaw canal receives a clockwise velocity impulse because it loses angular momentum on moving out of the plane of rotation.",

The term rolling effect or rolling mechanism is used as well. The dissociation of tissue layers with other epiphenomenon occurs. The presented group of 152 décollement determined in 103 autopsy cases during the 4 years period comprises the observation of décollement of different etiology of the injuries (traffic accidents, falls from the high, compression of the torso); in the traffic accidents the occurrence in various participants of the traffic, not only in the case of the collision of the pedestrians with various traffic vehicles, but also in drivers of various traffic vehicles, and fellow-travelers as well. The topic, the localization, the content, the extent, and vital reaction and combination injuries were followed-up. According to the variability of the injury etiology, not restricted to the traditional conception of the décollement mechanism, it is obvious that the passed on rule by far is not covering the whole content of this concept. We didn't find any alternative interpretation of until now presented mechanism in the literature. The medical literature focuses mostly on the clinical aspect of this injury. In this paper, the biomechanics of the décollement origin also in case of the tissue compression by the pressure applied perpendicularly to the body surface, the dependences on physical properties of the actively or passively affecting object, the relevance of the ratio of the tissue structures compression in one direction and transversal dilation in other two directions according to the Poisson's constant, the question of tangential factor of the force in case of vertical falling on the horizontal plane, and biomechanical relations in case of body landing on an oblique surface are discussed. The mechanism of décollement is more complex as presented until now. The forensic interpretation of findings should reflex the above-mentioned facts.",

Typically, spinal cord injury occurs in young or healthy adults due to trauma. spinal cord injury occurs in between age group 16-30 years. Spinal cord injury is classified as acute or chronic, there is no clear separation as when to classify as acute injury and when it gets convert into chronic injury. The time period between initial hours and few weeks after injury is consider as acute phase, while the time period between months to years is considered as chronic phase. The clinical classification of these two phases is necessary as there is significant difference in these two and needs different strategies to manage and regain it’s functional recovery Purpose: Traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) affects cervical spine in most of the cases. These causes limitation of activities of daily living and impairs quality of life due to paralysis of hand and arm. These leads to difficulties in feeding, grooming, or performing other upper extremity motor tasks. So in such cases the restoration of hand and arm functions is first priority of treatment before bladder, bowel, sexual or lower extremity dysfunction.[9] There are limited studies for improving hand function with help of electrical stimulation following motor function activities. Methodology: A 41 year old male mesomorphic in built and farmer by occupation came to Pravara Rural Hospital, Loni, Ahmednagar with chief complaints of unable to move his both lower limbs and difficulty in his upper limb activity (grasping) . the patient had difficulty in basic activities of daily living. The patient had history of fall from tree. He was diagnosed with traumatic cervical spine injury with complete paraplegia and quadriparesis with bowel and bladder involvement. So the patient was operated on 11th July 2019 for cervical spine disectomy + fusion (C6 – C7 ). Intervention: The patient received Electrical stimulation following hand exercises for improvement in hand function for 5 days a week for 3 weeks. Result: In this study we assessed the patient on action reach arm test (ARAT) for hand function, Functional Independence Measure for Quality of life (FIM), Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM) which showed significant improvement in results. Conclusion: it is concluded that electrical stimulation following hand function activities help in improving hand function in patients with spinal cord injury.",

The physical, mental and behavioural symptoms recur during the luteal phase of the cycle and cause a deterioration in the quality of life, affecting the patient's social, work and family relationships. Symptoms typically disappear spontaneously within a few days after the onset of menstruation. A severe form of PMS is premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), which requires psychiatric management. The onset and severity of PMS with multifactorial pathogenesis is triggered by psychoneuroendocrine mechanisms that are influenced by the cyclical functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis, altering the neurotransmitter or neuropathway functions of the brain, e.g., the serotoninergic system. The psychoneuroendocrine mechanisms contribute to the development of physical, psychological and behavioural symptoms, which are also influenced by the combined presence of other physiological (genetical background, metabolic and chronic inflammatory processes, chronobiological and circadian disorders) and psychological stressors and their interaction.A premenstruális szindróma (PMS) a reproduktív életkorú nők egyik leggyakoribb problémája világszerte a fájdalmas menstruáció és a nemi szervi gyulladások mellett.

A multifaktoriális kóreredetű PMS megjelenését és súlyosságát a hypothalamus–hypophysis–ovarium tengely ciklikus működésének hatására kialakuló pszichoneuroendokrin mechanizmusok indítják el, megváltoztatva az agy neurotranszmitter- vagy neuropeptid-funkcióit, például a szerotoninerg rendszer működését. A pszichoneuroendokrin mechanizmusok hozzájárulnak a fizikai, a pszichológiai és a viselkedésbeli tünetek kialakulásához, melyeket befolyásol még az egyéb fiziológiai (például genetikai háttér, metabolikus és krónikus gyulladásos folyamatok, kronobiológiai és cirkadián működészavarok), illetve pszichikai stresszorok együttes jelenléte, illetve azok egymásra való kölcsönhatása is.

      "title": "The Thematic Analysis of Post Traumatic Growth",
      "abstract": "The ability to recognize trauma has change radically over the course of time. Earlier it was only noted in men after catastrophic wars. The women's movement in sixties broadened the definition of trauma to include physically and sexually abused women and children. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental disorders, 4th edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV- TR; American Psychiatric Association [APA], 2000) specifically defines trauma as direct personal experiences of an event that involves actual or threatened death or serious injury, or other threat to one's physical integrity of another person; or learning about unexpected or violent death, serious harm, or threat of death or injury experienced by a family member or other close associate. The person's response to the event must involve intense fear, helplessness, or horror (or in children, the response must involve disorganized or agitated behavior). Trauma can also be defined as the experience of survivor. Two people could face the same noxious situation and one person might be traumatized and the other person remains relatively unscathed. DSM-IV-TR provide a list of potentially traumatic events including combat, sexual and physical assault, robbery, being kidnapped, being taken hostage, terrorist attacks, torture, disasters, severe automobile accidents, and life threatening illnesses, as well as witnessing death or serious injury by violent assault, accidents, wars or disaster. Holbrook ,Hoyt, Setin, Sieber (2002) in their study of gender differences in long-term Post Traumatic Stress Disorder outcomes after major trauma found that women were at higher at higher risk of higher risk of prolonged Post Traumatic Stress Disorder onset which was associated with reduced quality oflife markedly worse quality ofwell-being outcomes. The psychological effects caused by trauma are likely to be more severe if the trauma is human caused, repeated, unpredictable, multifaceted, sadistic, undergone in childhood and perpetrated by caregiver (Wortman, Battle, & Lemkau, 1997). Nightmares, insomnia, somatic disturbances, difficulty with intimate relationships, fear, anxiety, anger, shame, aggression, suicidal behaviors, loss of trust and isolation are the symptoms commonly seen after trauma (Allen, 1995). Tedeschi and Calhoun (1996) developed 21-item scale including factors new possibilities, relating to others, personal strength, spiritual change and appreciation oflife found that women tend to report more benefits than do men. Sears, Stanton, Danoff and Sharon (2003) found distinct significant predictors and outcomes of benefit finding, positive reappraisal coping and Post Traumatic Growth from a longitudinal study of women having breast cancer.The neuroscience of trauma reveals that trauma actually changes the structure and function of the brain, at the point where the frontal cortex, the limbic system and the brain stem converge. The two factors that facilitate Post Traumatic Growth are the cognitive processing and disclosure (Tedeschi & Calhoun, 1998). It is also suggested that Post Traumatic Growth mutually interacts with life wisdom, and the development of the life narrative, and that it is an ongoing process, not a static outcome. The review also revealed inconsistent associations between adversarial growths, socio-demo graphic variable and psychological distress. Ickovics, Meade, Kershaw, Milan, Lewis and Ethier ( 2006) studied traumatic events, Post Traumatic Growth and emotional distress over eighteen months among urban adolescent girls and found post traumatic growth was associated with subsequent reduction in short and long term emotional distress. Women are the marginalized group of the society, especially in Indian context women are always protected and are considered safe at home. They live in guarded environment from childhood to marriage. Certain circumstances after marriage leave them exposed to world, making them vulnerable to all kind of situations. They face the trauma, they live with traumatic experiences and they survive after trauma. …",

      "title": "Swallowing Disorders and Rehabilitation Techniques",
      "abstract": "Dysphagia may be defined as \"difficulty moving food from the mouth to the stomach\" (M. Donner, Dysphagia, 1, 1988) and encompasses impaired airway protection and problems with secretion management. There are a variety of neurological and neuromuscular conditions that can impair the oral, pharyngeal and esophageal phases of swallowing and cause dysphagia in infants and children. Neurologic conditions can be acute in onset (e.g. hemorrhagic, infectious, inflammatory, traumatic, cerebral infarctions) or chronic (e.g. cerebral palsy, genetic disorders, encephalopathy, myopathy, neuropathy). There are various conditions that will cause neurogenic dysphagia that are also progressive in nature and can worsen in adulthood (e.g. Arnold-Chiari malformation, intracranial malignancies, dystonia, metabolic disorders, degenerative cortical conditions). These various conditions can progress rapidly or may be subtle and slow in their emergence. Symptoms of dysphagia in infants and children include: failure to thrive, meal-time distress, spitting, vomiting, choking, coughing and gagging during meals, refusing food, excessive oral secretions, oral-tactile hypersensitivity, aspiration-related respiratory conditions, and gastroesophageal or pharyngeal reflux. The ability to swallow, suck and breathe are completely developed at birth. Recent ultrasound studies of the fetus indicate that suckling is present between the 18th and 24th week and that by 34 weeks in-utero a regular burst-pause pattern of swallow is present. This burst-pause pattern together with a stable airway are prerequisites for normal infant feeding. By the time a child is between 18 to 24 months of age, independent self-feeding for most foods is well established. The normal anatomical and physiological development of the infant swallow will be presented and contrasted with the adult swallow. Conditions that impair this normal pattern of swallow will be presented and their symptoms discussed as they relate to infants and children. When problems persist beyond 6 months of age \"intervention usually is required to resolve difficulties with spoon feeding, cupdrinking, chewing, self-feeding skills and suckling\" (Sheppard, 1997, p.57). Table Feeding disorders and dysphagia in infants and children can be both physiological or behavioral in nature. If the child is unable to eat successfully or displays negative and aversive behaviors during mealtimes, problems in parent-child interactions may emerge that place unusual stresses on the family. Stress may contribute to creation of persistent behavioral abnormalities and aversive meal-times reactions. Therefore it is important that swallowing intervention is initiated as early as possible to avoid the pervasive problems that may occur in children who are not eating normally. A thorough medical/behavioral history and clinical feeding evaluation must be conducted before starting treatment. This evaluation should be family-centered and include observations during feeding. Because management of these children may be complicated, multidisciplinary team evaluations should be conducted. The members of this team may include pediatricians, gastroenterologists, neurologists, speech-language pathologists, nurses, physical and occupational therapists, radiologists, otalaryngologists, pharmacists and psychologists to develop a diagnosis and plan of management. Provision of treatment of dysphagia is usually conducted by the speech-language pathologist trained in pediatric dysphagia and includes: therapeutic strategies for nonnutritive oral stimulation, airway and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) management, habilitation of feeding, drooling, nutritional and mealtime management techniques. For those children who have been intubated, management includes teaching techniques that will facilitate transitioning from nonoral to oral feeding. Successful rehabilitation of children with swallowing disorders requires knowledge of the parameters of normal and abnormal oral pharyngeal and esophageal swallowing plus skill in the integration of a variety of essential therapeutics techniques.",

      "title": "Persistent Symptoms After a Concussion",
      "abstract": "Since my car accident a year ago, I am a mess. I can't think, I can't remember, and my head hurts all the time. I can't tolerate taking my kids to the mall. I can't work, I'm crying and yelling, and my house is a wreck. I can't stand being around my friends—and my marriage is on the rocks. I need help!Although the vast majority of individuals who have traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) categorized as \"mild\" and who have been diagnosed with \"concussion\" return to baseline functioning within several months, a subset of individuals experience persistent symptoms that affect quality of life. These symptoms may occur in less than 5% of individuals with mild TBI (mTBI), and are significantly influenced by non-injury-related factors (McCrea et al. 2009). Several factors are implicated in prolonged symptoms, including the pathophysiology of the injury, preinjury factors (e.g., preexisting psychiatric and subance use problems, previous TBI, intelligence, gender, age, personality style), and postinjury factors (social support, availability of adequate treatment, litigation/compensation) (Carroll et al. 2004; McAllister 2011). This paradigm serves as a guide to the evaluation of the patient with persistent symptoms after a concussion. What does the psychiatrist or mental health worker do when first confronted with a patient who has persistent symptoms? The first thing not to do is to assume that all problems that started after a bump on the head in a motor vehicle accident (or fall, or other injury) are due directly to the mTBI. Acute postconcussion symptoms are fairly consistent in their presentation and, by definition, are time limited. At the initial presentation, several symptoms predominate: problems with thinking, often described as feeling \"fuzzy\" or \"slowed down\"; physical problems, including insomnia, fatigue, headache, dizziness, and visual problems; and emotional and behavioral problems, including feeling depressed or tearful, anxious, and irritable. When symptoms spread into multiple domains, persist for more than a few months, and then begin to coalesce and globally impair—and increasingly erode—functioning, it no longer makes sense to speak of a \"postconcussion syndrome.\" We, along with others, do not believe the term postconcussion syndrome is valid or helpful, because symptoms do not represent a single pathophysiological process (McAllister 2011). Similarly, we discourage use of the term persistent (or chronic ) postconcussion syndrome (or symptoms ). We believe that, more accurately, this problem should be referred to as persistent symptoms that occur after a concussion. This term, which has diagnostic and therapeutic implications, represents acknowledgment that multiple factors play a role in the persistence of symptoms that may not reflect a continuation of those first evident after the so-called concussion. The constellation of symptoms that resulted directly from the concussion is no longer a unitary force driving dysfunction. The person who seeks attention for persistent symptoms that occur 6 or more months after TBI is already one who is atypical of most people who suffer concussions. Some combination of factors makes this individual different from those who have recovered typically after mTBI. If the person has been referred into the mental health system, someone likely has already come to this conclusion. Although some patients will present with psychologically uncomplicated neurological abnormalities that have been missed, the vast majority of persons presenting within the mental health system long after a concussion will have a dizzying array of symptoms that need disentangling. These individuals may face psychosocial challenges involving returning to work, relationships with family members, and interactions with the legal and insurance systems. Individual symptoms may amplify and exacerbate each other. The person may have lost confidence in himself or herself, and \"secondary\" depression may have developed. Our way of approaching cases of persistent symptoms that occur after a concussion requires a reframing of the core diagnostic question. The question is not whether or not this person has a TBI—a dangerous dichotomizing question that typifies medicolegal quagmires. TBI is an event, not an explanatory diagnosis. Instead, the question is this: If a TBI (mild or severe) did occur in the past, what are its present direct or indirect manifestations, are the persistent symptoms related to it, and what can be done to ameliorate them? Too often, patients are deemed not to have a \"real\" TBI and are then dismissed from the rehabilitation system and by other medical specialists. These patients usually have experienced a traumatic event, such as an accident or assault, that has its own emotional ramifications. The challenge to the mental health practitioner is to successfully work with such patients regardless of the etiology of their complex symptoms. Considering the person as a whole—and how the injury may have disrupted his or her sense of self (along neurological, physical, and psychological dimensions)—is more likely to lead to a practical approach to treatment. In this chapter, we—a neuropsychologist (T.K.) and neuropsychiatrist (J.M.S.)—offer our perspectives on factors that influence the persistence of symptoms after a concussion, and highlight important aspects of evaluation and treatment of such symptoms.",

      "title": "Conversion disorder following termination of pregnancy.",
      "abstract": "A variety of psychologic disorders may present as physical complaints without organic basis. As characterized by Sydenham over 300 years ago, such disorders \"mimic all the physical disease to which man is heir.\" The case here presents the evolution of a conversion disorder (urinary retention) in response to a decision to terminate pregnancy. The predominant disturbance in a conversion disorder is an involuntary loss or alteration in somatic function that is temporally related with an environmental stressor. Conversion, as a defense mechanism, provides primary gain by keeping the conflict from the patient's awareness and secondary gains by generating environmental support and avoidance of undesired activities. Awareness of a patient's current life events, past responses to stress, and support systems is essential in order to recognize and manage this array of physical complaints of functional origin.The case report discussed here presents the evolution of a conversion disorder (urinary retention) in response to a decision to terminate a pregnancy. According to the \"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\" (DSM 3), the following are the current criteria for a diagnosis of conversion (psychogenic pain): the predominant disturbance is a loss of or alteration in physical functioning suggesting a physical disorder; psychological factors are judged to be etiologically involved as evidenced by 1 of the following--a temporal relationship exists between an environmental stimulus that apparently related to a psychological conflict or need and the initiation or exacerbation of the symptom, the symptom enables the individual to get support from the environment that otherwise might not be forthcoming, and the symptom enables the individual to avoid some noxious activity; it has been determined that the symptom is not under voluntary control; and the symptom cannot be explained by a known physical disorder or pathophysiologic mechanism. A 25-year old single white woman (para 0, gravida 1) was hospitalized for termination of pregnancy at 22 weeks of gestation. The patient told her physician that she did not know she was pregnant. The operative procedure was uncomplicated, and the patient was discharged. 5 days later she presented to the emergency room with the complaint that she was unable to void. Following catheterization, which recovered 800 mL of urine, the patient returned home. Within 24 hours she again complained of an inability to void. Admission to the gynecological service resulted in a 16-day stay involving a continued inability to void requiring repeated catheterizations. Psychiatric consultation revealed marked immaturity, an inappropriately labile affect, and indifference to her symptoms. A history of occasional substance abuse was elicited. Upon transfer to the psychiatric inpatient service, the patient began to void spontaneously. The reported incidence of psychiatric sequelae after therapeutic or legal abortion is low, but the degree of preabortion emotional difficulty appears in direct proportion to the incidence of postabortion behavioral complications. The selection of a target organ for conversion is often based upon its ability to achieve symbolic representation. In the case presented the anatomic proximity of the bladder and uterus is cogent with the Freudian concent of somatic compliance whereby a previous somatic injury or disease may dictate the conversion focus by reactivation of the original event.",

      "abstract": "SUMMARYMuscle pain during and after exercise can appear as a result of various conditions, both pathophysiologic [e.g., arterial obstructive pathologies, presence of trigger points, occurrence of traumatic events] and physiologic [dynamic concentric, isometric and dynamic eccentric muscle contraction]. Pain from dynamic concentric contraction has been investigated through execution of rectangular and triangular tests on cycloergolmeter. In the rectangular tests, pain never appears for trials performed below a certain workload [critical exertion], while it is always present, and with a latency progressively lower as the exertion increases, for higher workloads. It is oppressive or cramp-like, fairly well discriminated and diffuse. In triangular tests performed up to maximal exertion, pain starts at well-defined work intensities and increases progressively until the trial has to be stopped. Pain occurring during protracted isometric contractions is characteristically burning, increases steadily in intensity until determining interruption of the trial. For progressively increasing workloads, the painful response is exponential, regarding both the latency to onset and the maximum tolerability. Dynamic eccentric contractions, like those involved in heavy or unaccustomed exercise, are associated with a type of muscle pain that becomes evident some hours after the end of exercise and may persist for several days [DOMS: delayed onset muscle soreness]. Delayed onset muscle soreness is associated with a reversible damage of muscle fibers. Pain from physical exercise is markedly reduced in extent and/or duration by a specific training for the type of muscle contraction involved.",

Generalement, elles manifestent des reactions de stress depasse sous forme d’etat de choc ou d’agitation, voire de reactions mecaniques dont l’apparente normalite est souvent trompeuse. Ces reactions sont marquees par la detresse peri-traumatique et les symptomes dissociatifs. Les sujets predisposes peuvent declencher des troubles psychopathologiques nevrotiques (hysteriques, phobiques ou obsessionnels) ou des desordres psychotiques (trouble reactionnel post-traumatique, trouble psychotique bref, bouffees delirante ou autres affections psychotiques vraies). – Ces reactions disparaissent souvent au bout de quelques jours ou de quelques semaines. Cependant, certaines jeunes victimes voient leurs troubles persister et d’autres commencent a souffrir de symptomes prefigurant un syndrome psychotraumatique. D’autres encore vont inaugurer ou confirmer une psychopathologie nevrotique ou psychotique. – Generalement, chez les jeunes victimes, le syndrome post-traumatique apparait rapidement apres l’evenement critique. Il s’observe frequemment des l’âge de 3 ans. Il se caracterise par la reviviscence de l’evenement adverse sous forme de symptomes intrusifs (flash-back, souvenirs repetitifs, cauchemars, impression que l’evenement pourrait se renouveler, phenomenes moteurs elementaires, conduite de repetition et jeux repetitifs, detresse et reactivite physiologique a l’exposition d’indices rappelant l’evenement), par l’emoussement de la reactivite generale (desinteret pour l’entourage et les activites) et l’evitement des stimuli qui lui sont associes (lieux, personnes, conversations, pensees et sentiments) ainsi que par une hyper activation neurovegetative. – Les nourrissons, les enfants et les adolescents manifestent frequemment des troubles non specifiques aux syndromes post-traumatiques tels les troubles anxieux (crises d’angoisse, agitation, surveillance inquiete de l’environnement, attachement anxieux, exacerbation des peurs infantiles), des symptomes depressifs (desarroi, tristesse, sentiment de solitude, inhibition motrice et intellectuelle, repli sur soi, sentiments de culpabilite excessifs et inappropries), des desordres psychosomatiques (symptomes neurovegetatifs, asthenie, douleurs psychogenes, regain d’une maladie psychosomatique preexistante), des perturbations du comportement (auto – et hetero-agressivite, conduites a risque, instabilite motrice, troubles du sommeil, desordres alimentaires, dependances) ainsi que des comportements regressifs et des difficultes d’apprentissage. – Le DSM-IV repertorie l’Etat de Stress Aigu englobant tant les reactions de survenue immediate durant au moins deux jours que les reponses post-immediates perdurant jusqu’a quatre semaines apres l’incident. La CIM-10 decrit la reaction aigue a un facteur de stress apparaissant dans les minutes suivant l’incident critique et disparaissant en quelques heures, tout a plus en quelques jours.",

      "title": "Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)",
      "abstract": "Social anxiety disorder (SAD), also known as social phobia, encompasses fear and avoidance of social or performance situations, with prominent fear of embarrassment or humiliation (see Box 18–1 for the DSM-5 criteria). The disorder is very common, with a lifetime prevalence of 12% (Ruscio et al. 2008). It typically has onset by teenage years and is often chronic. The scope of feared situations can range from fear of a few specific public performance situations to a more generalized fear of most social situations. In this chapter we review the psychosocial and medication approaches with the strongest evidence base for efficacy in the treatment of SAD. DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Social Anxiety Disorder 300.23 F40.10 Marked fear or anxiety about one or more social situations in which the individual is exposed to possible scrutiny by others. Examples include social interactions (e.g., having a conversation, meeting unfamiliar people), being observed (e.g., eating or drinking), and performing in front of others (e.g., giving a speech). Note: In children, the anxiety must occur in peer settings and not just during interactions with adults. The individual fears that he or she will act in a way or show anxiety symptoms that will be negatively evaluated (i.e., will be humiliating or embarrassing; will lead to rejection or offend others). The social situations almost always provoke fear or anxiety. Note: In children, the fear or anxiety may be expressed by crying, tantrums, freezing, clinging, shrinking, or failing to speak in social situations. The social situations are avoided or endured with intense fear or anxiety. The fear or anxiety is out of proportion to the actual threat posed by the social situation and to the sociocultural context. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is persistent, typically lasting for 6 months or more. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is not attributable to the physiological effects of a substance (e.g., a drug of abuse, a medication) or another medical condition. The fear, anxiety, or avoidance is not better explained by the symptoms of another mental disorder, such as panic disorder, body dysmorphic disorder, or autism spectrum disorder. If another medical condition (e.g., Parkinson's disease, obesity, disfigurement from burns or injury) is present, the fear, anxiety, or avoidance is clearly unrelated or is excessive. Specify if: Performance only: If the fear is restricted to speaking or performing in public.",

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can develop following exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence, and includes symptoms across four clusters: intrusions (e.g., unwanted and intrusive memories or images), avoidance (e.g., avoidance of people, places, or things that serve as reminders of the trauma), alterations in cognitions or mood (e.g., anhedonia, numbness, exaggerated negative beliefs about oneself, others or the world), and arousal (e.g., hypervigilance, irritable/angry behavior). PTSD is associated with family and relational distress; social, educational, and occupational impairment; comorbid psychiatric and physical conditions; and high economic costs and medical utilization.

      "abstract": "Introducción El sueño es un estado natural y fisiológico rítmico, aparece por la melatonina activada por la oscuridad, esto disminuye la conciencia, inmovilidad, relajación muscular. También está enlazado a la salud integral, un desorden en su patrón o calidad conduce al cambio en el estado de ánimo; el insomnio es el más prevalente y se define como “dificultad persistente en el inicio del sueño que ocurre a pesar de adecuadas oportunidades para el mismo” De la misma forma, los problemas de menoscabo de sueño se han relacionado con trastornos de ansiedad y depresión en la población, es por ello como destaca “la depresión es un trastorno mental que se caracteriza por tristeza, perdida de interés o placer acompañados de sentimientos de culpa o autoestima baja, alteraciones del sueño o del apetito, fatiga y falta de concentración”. De la misma manera define la ansiedad como “la anticipación temerosa de peligro inminente acompañada de un sentimiento intenso en cualquier región geográfica corporal, implicando un presentimiento de que algo grave le va a pasar”. Los problemas de deterioro de sueño se han relacionado con trastornos de ansiedad y depresión, es por ello como destaca “la depresión es un trastorno mental que se caracteriza por tristeza, culpabilidad, autoestima baja, alteraciones del sueño o del apetito, fatiga y falta de concentración”. Conforme NANDA Esta investigación tiene como objetivo analizar el deterioro del patrón del sueño en los estudiantes de enfermería de la facultad Ciencias de la Salud de la Universidad Técnica de Ambato. Objetivos Determinar el deterioro del patrón del sueño en os estudiantes de enfermería según NANDA Método La presente investigación es de carácter cuantitativo, no experimental, descriptivo y transversal. Utiliza la recolección de datos con la aplicación de la encuesta del Índice de Calidad de Sueño de Pittsburg sobre la calidad de sueño en su versión en español contando con un alfa de Cronbach del 0.84 garantizando su fiabilidad, es así que la encuesta cuenta con 19 preguntas autoevaluadas y 5 preguntas evaluadas por el acompañante de habitación del paciente si está disponible, en donde los componentes son: calidad subjetiva del sueño, latencia del sueño, duración del sueño, eficiencia del sueño, alteraciones del sueño, uso de medicamentos para dormir y disfunción diurna. La puntuación de cada componente es de 0 al 3, donde 0 es muy bueno y 3 muy malo, solo las preguntas auto aplicadas están incluidas en este puntaje aplicándose en 78 estudiantes de enfermería y su posterior análisis en Excel e IBM SPSS 25. Principales resultados Al enfocarnos en los siete componentes del índice de calidad de sueño de Pittsburg: 1. Calidad subjetiva del sueño: 42,3% de los sujetos de estudio tienen una mala calidad subjetiva del sueño. 2. Latencia de sueño: 41% presentó sensación de dificultad para dormir por lo menos una vez a la semana. 3. Duración del dormir: 6 a 7 horas en un 33,3% es la duración promedio del sueño de la mayoría de los sujetos de estudio es 4. Eficiencia de sueño: 59% de los estudiantes de enfermería tienen una eficiencia del sueño mayor al 85%. 5. Perturbaciones del sueño: 61,5% tiene perturbaciones en el sueño por lo menos una vez a la semana. 6. Uso de medicamentos para dormir: 82,1% de los refieren que no ha tomado medicina para dormir en ninguna ocasión en el último mes. 7. Disfunción diurna: 44,9% de los sujetos de estudio ha tenido disfunción diurna del sueño por lo menos una vez a la semana mientras. Conclusiones En la presente investigación se concluye que los estudiantes de enfermería del ciclo académico octubre 2022 – marzo 2023 de la Universidad Técnica de Ambato presentan deterioro en el patrón del sueño con pocas horas de descanso, interrupción entre el mismo y acompañado de somnolencia; trayendo como consecuencias un leve problema en su energía para realizar actividades cotidianas. A su vez los participantes tienen una dificultad para dormir, problemática que podría acogerse a la automedicación, dado que en el presente estudio si se obtuvo resultados de toma de medicación para dormir y más en personas divorciadas y del género masculino, pudiendo así causar fármaco dependencia en un futuro o el inicio de automedicación de los estudiantes de enfermería.",

      "title": "Effectiveness of progressive muscle relaxation training for adults diagnosed with schizophrenia: a systematic review protocol",
      "abstract": "Review question/objective The objective of this review is to systematically search, appraise and synthesize the best available evidence on the effectiveness of Progressive Muscle Relaxation (PMR) in the human responses of adults with schizophrenia and no positive symptoms of disease, in any setting, regarding anxiety, social isolation, personal and social functioning, cognition, sadness, conversation, and well-being. More specifically, the review will focus on the following question: What is the effectiveness of Progressive Muscle Relaxation training on anxiety, social isolation, personal and social functioning, cognition, conversation, and well-being in adults with schizophrenia? Background Schizophrenia is often characterized by a long prodromal phase and a gradual change in psychosocial functioning, with symptoms that could include changes in affect (such as anxiety, irritability and depression), cognition (such as difficulty in concentration or memory), thought content (such as preoccupation with new ideas), physical changes (such as sleep disturbance and loss of energy), social withdrawal and impairment of role functioning.1,2 Anxiety is a prominent symptom, early in the course of schizophrenia, and is viewed both as a co-morbidity and a clinical expression of schizophrenia.3 Anxiety can be a stress factor that worsens existing prodromes or symptoms, leading to a vicious circle of growing stress and increased symptoms.4 Overall, the consequences alone or in combination of these components of anxiety generate a reduced efficiency of behaviour. The anxious individual, in addition to avoiding or escaping from situations, also shows inhibition in many other activities such as establishing contact and performing professional activities outside his/her routine.5,6 The physiological and cognitive aspects can create a vicious circle with negative thoughts leading to sympathetic changes, which are themselves interpreted in a negative way. The result can be a spiraling of anxiety.6 “Stress is an everyday fact of life, and we can't avoid it”.8(p.1) “Nervous tension is a more frequent ailment than the common cold. It is a greater danger because tension can reduce your efficiency, destroy your health and shorten your life”.7(p.1) We consider that day-to-day living confronts the person with a continuous stream of potentially stressful situations. If stress is acknowledged as reasonable, it becomes propulsive, constituting an impulse that causes the individual to make decisions, solve problems, and improve his/her functioning and abilities. In this sense, stress will help motivate the individual to achieve desirable goals, giving some flavor to life and providing an incentive for personal and professional achievement.8,9 We can experience stress from four basic sources: the Environment (the environment besieges you with demands to adjust); Social Stressors (the demands of the different social roles we play); Physiological Sources (transitions affecting our body); and Thoughts (our brain interprets and perceives complex changes in our environment and body, and determines whether they are a problem for us and when to turn to “emergency responses”).8 The anxiety experienced in day-to-day life situations is, therefore, interpreted as a complex set of emotions, and a personality trait or a state of the individual which combines three components: cognitive, vegetative, and motor. The cognitive component relates to all thoughts and feelings developed by someone who is anxious, and relates to what the person states that he/she feels. The vegetative component translates the physiological arousal of the individual when he/she is anxious. This activation is specific to each person so it may present great variability of responses such as increased heart rate and blood pressure, changes in gastric motility, urinary emergency, sweating, and increased muscle tension. The motor component refers to the previously addressed avoidance and escape responses determined by anxiety, limiting the individual's purview expressed through tense postures and different types of unrelaxed activities.5 One way of breaking the anxiety circle would be to reinterpret bodily changes in a positive thoughts form (cognitive approach). Another way would be to use relaxation techniques such as progressive muscle relaxation (physiological theory). A third way would be to introduce graded exposure to the feared situation (behavioural approach).6 Relaxation is conceptualized as a complex response class involving motor, visceral, observational responses and verbal behaviour. Motor behaviour involves action of the skeletal muscles. Visceral responding is concerned with homeostatic functions including breathing, temperature, and muscle tension. Observational responses seek out stimuli in the environment (e.g. a quiet park setting) or generate discriminative stimuli (e.g. “seeing” a quiet park setting). Verbal behaviour is concerned with overt or covert vocal behaviour (e.g. “I am tense”) in relation to relaxed behaviour.10 Many relaxation techniques aim to increase awareness of areas of chronic unconscious muscle tension. They often involve a conscious attempt to release and relax during exhalation. Frequently, habituation occurs with repeated exposure, but some people continue to react as if they were seeing this particular stressor for the first time. Mental escape techniques, such as imagery or relaxation therapy, can help decrease arousal, but learning is essential to adaptation. Most relaxation techniques are enjoyable, and many healthy individuals practice them without having particular health problems.11,12 There are two general purposes of tension control: prophylactic and therapeutic. By learning to relax differentially 24 hours a day, a person can increase the likelihood of preventing a stress or tension disorder. For a person already thus victimized, clinical PMR can often ease or eliminate the condition.11 Most relaxation techniques need to be practiced daily. Typically, patients learn a relaxation technique over the course of eight weekly classes, each lasting an hour or so. Between classes, they practice by themselves for 15 to 30 minutes a day. After the course is over, patients are encouraged to continue on their own, though they may take further classes to learn advanced techniques or to maintain group support.12 PMR was originally developed by Edmund Jacobson, and his original method required dozens of sessions where the participant was taught to relax 30 different muscle groups. Training consisted of successive tensing and relaxing of muscle groups, beginning with the upper body and proceeding to the lower parts.13 Based on different sources, we can state that recently there has been a growing interest in relaxation techniques in the multidisciplinary treatment of patient's response to schizophrenia symptomatology. The only existing revision, within this topic, “Progressive muscle relaxation in persons with schizophrenia: a systematic review of randomized controlled trials”, aims to assess the effectiveness of progressive muscle relaxation (PMR) on psychological distress and anxiety symptoms and on response/remission for people with schizophrenia. The three selected randomized controlled trials (RCT) involved 146 patients, and authors concluded that PMR can acutely reduce state anxiety and psychological distress, and improve subjective well-being. No studies investigated the evidence for PMR as an add-on treatment for psychopathology, or for positive or negative symptoms, or for relapse prevention. This review demonstrates that PMR might be a useful add-on treatment to reduce state anxiety and psychological distress, and improve subjective well-being in persons with schizophrenia. It further demonstrates that PMR may be offered in both acute and chronic inpatient treatment settings.6 The recent research “Acute effects of progressive muscle relaxation on state anxiety and subjective well-being in chronic Bulgarian patients with schizophrenia” aimed to provide evidence on the effectiveness of PMR as means of alleviating the state anxiety and psychological distress and a way to increase subjective well-being in chronic patients with schizophrenia. Sixty-four schizophrenia patients underwent two PMR sessions which were offered once a week and lasted approximately 25 minutes13 Results revealed significant decreased state anxiety and psychological stress, and increased subjective well-being within the experimental group, and it is noteworthy that both groups differed significantly in all post-measures. Therefore, this study provides scientific evidence for the use of PMR in patients with schizophrenia in chronic psychiatric settings, offering an easy method to learn healthy alternatives to cope with subjective stress and state anxiety. A recent RCT on effects of progressive muscle relaxation on state anxiety aimed to examine the efficacy of a single progressive muscle relaxation session compared with a control condition on state anxiety, psychological stress, fatigue and subjective well-being in patients with acute inpatient schizophrenia. Sixty-four patients were randomly assigned to either a single progressive muscle relaxation session of 25 minutes or a resting control condition with the opportunity to read for an equal amount of time.14 The results show that the 27 PMR group participants showed decreased state anxiety, psychological stress and fatigue and increased subjective well-being. Between-group differences in post scores were found for state anxiety, subjective well-being and psychological stress, but not for fatigue. The authors state that PMR is highly effective in reducing acute feelings of stress and anxiety in patients with schizophrenia. A reduction in stress and state anxiety is associated with an increase in subjective well-being.14 Another recent RCT on efficacy of progressive muscle relaxation training in reducing anxiety assigned 18 randomized patients to experimental and control groups. The experimental group received PMR training and the control group received a placebo intervention. Results show that the anxiety level improvement was significantly higher in the PMR training group after intervention and at follow-up, and the mean Beck Anxiety Inventory score fell from moderate anxiety on the pre-test to normal anxiety on the post-test.15 Therefore, the authors state that PMR training is a potentially effective nursing intervention to reduce anxiety in patients diagnosed with schizophrenia, depending on the quality of their mental status at the time of intervention.15 The recent research about development of self-control strategies and stress management aimed to verify the impact of self-control skills and a stress management programme. During nine months, 14 participants with schizophrenia took part in a psycho-educative programme based on the relaxation principles of Jacobson, Shultz, and Desoille.16 Significant differences were found between pre- and post-test evaluations, revealing a decrease in stress levels and an increase in coping strategies, especially related with “self-control”, “assuming responsibility”, and “positive re-evaluation”. Furthermore, it is relevant to comprise all possible limitations of this therapy. Despite the fact that PMR sessions were experienced with satisfaction and wellness, a certain degree of motivation is necessary to embrace the regular use of this technique on a daily or weekly basis. Most publications indicate that adverse events resulting from relaxation techniques seem to be extremely uncommon; however, patients with heart and cardiovascular diseases, as well as patients with psychiatric disorders who present positive symptoms and risk of disorientation or confusion should be treated carefully. Although there already exists a systematic review on this topic, it only includes RCT design studies, and the outcomes of psychological distress and anxiety. In this JBI protocol for Systematic Review, we intend to go beyond that, as defined in the inclusion criteria, and consider any quantitative study design, setting, and outcome that will include all scientific/standardized assessments (questionnaires or scales) of anxiety, social isolation, personal and social functioning, cognition, conversation, and well-being. Thus, this systematic literature review is considered to be timely and relevant.",

      "title": "A Systematic Review of Thought Control Strategies in Obsessive Compulsive Disorder",
      "abstract": "Among all the neurotic conditions obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) considered as a debilitating one. Obsessive thoughts are categorized as unwanted, repetitive and intrusive thoughts, impulses or images that lead a sufferer to an unpleasant sate, called anxiety. In order to get relief from the unpleasant state caused by the obsessive thoughts, some repetitive behaviors or rituals performed by the sufferers which are regarded as compulsions. Basically, these rituals are performed with the intent to alleviate the anxiety stemming from obsessive thoughts. These obsessive thoughts are also common among people without having OCD (Clark &amp; De Silva, 1985). The cognitive formulations of OCD have proposed theories regarding how “normal” Intrusive thoughts have the potential to evolve into diagnosed obsessions (Clark, 2004; Rachman, 1993, 1997, 1998, 2003; Salkovskis, 1985, 1999). The ego-dystonic thought contents, such as aggressiveness, blasphemy, and infection, in the first instance, encourages frightening interpretations of their appearance. These unhelpful interpretations lead individuals to consciously try to manage or ignore intrusive thoughts in an attempt to lessen the discomfort they feel or to avoid anticipated negative outcomes. (Rachman, 1998). Therefore, it is thought that efforts to suppress and/or control intrusive thoughts are crucial in the development and/or upkeep of clinical obsessions. However, it has been found that intrusive thoughts are less distressing in case of normal people compared to those having OCD (Rachman&amp; De Silva, 1978; Salkoskis&amp;Harrison 1984). If obsessive thoughts are experienced by both people having OCD and without having OCD then why do these thoughts are distressing among former than the latter?",

This latent (“silent”) period may offer a therapeutic window for the prevention of epileptogenesis and the subsequent development of unprovoked seizures and epilepsy.2",

It was hypothesized that hypersensitivity to movement perception is one important mechanism leading to somatoform vertigo. This may be due to central sensitization as described in other chronic conditions (e.g. primary headaches).",

Given unfavorable polygenic potentiators (eg, introversion, hypohedonia, and anxiety) and adverse life experiences (eg, childhood trauma or adult misfortune), around 10% develop schizophrenia. That schizophrenia is basically a neurologic disorder does not contradict whatever is known about its psychodynamics, nor preclude efficacy for psychotherapy or other psychosocial interventions. Research should concentrate on soft neurology and psychophysiology as indicators, being closer in the causal chain to the schizogene than psychometric, social, or high-level cognitive processes. Taxometric statistics are appropriate to testing a major locus model not simplistically formulated.",

Focal damage occurs typically because of compression, either as a nerve passes through a tissue tunnel or against a bone, for example the common peroneal nerve against the fibula. Anterior horn cell diseases are either sporadic, for example the typical common Motor Neurone Disease (MND), or hereditary – Spinal Muscular Atrophies. MND is a common degenerative disease of the neurones within the corticospinal tracts, brainstem and anterior horn cells that leads to disability and death. The principal function of the muscle cell is to respond to a motor neurone action potential by contracting, thus transforming electrical and chemical energy into a graded mechanical response – and then relaxing.

Obsessions are experienced as unwanted and involuntary by the patient and can focus on such themes as contamination, aggression, orderliness, religion, sex:, doubt, or loss of possessions. Compulsions are ritualistic but seemingly purposeful behaviors that are often performed in response to an obsession. These compulsive behaviors, either observable or mental, alleviate or neutralize anxiety associated with the obsession. The patient fears the outcome should he or she not perform the ritual, despite the knowledge that the fear is irrational. Because the ritual does not entirely relieve the fear, the impulse to repeat the ritual returns. Common compulsive behaviors include hand-washing, checking, arranging, touching, repeating, or hoarding. Table 1 summarizes diagnostic criteria according to the American Psychiatric Association. l Obsessive-compulsive disorder occurs at some point during a lifetime in approximately 2.5 to 3 percent of the population; it is equally common in men as in women, and one-third of the cases begin by the age of 15 years.2 As with many other psychiatric illnesses, patients might not seek care until years after the onset of the disease. A variety of causes have been proposed: behavioral, developmental, biochemical, psychological, and genetic. Familial tendencies have been seen in obsessive-compulsive disorder. In one sample of children with obsessive-compulsive disorder, 71 percent had a parent with either full-blown obsessive-compulsive disotder or obsessive-compulsive symptoms.3 The symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder have also previously been viewed as extreme variants of normal developmental rituals",

Such ultimate aversive consequences, although ranging in severity from interpersonal disruption through physical symptoms such as hangover, withdrawal, and even death, appear to have little real control over the behavior that produces them (especially in terms of reduction of the addictive behaviors) All of these addictive behaviors appear to have in common similar antecedents, consequences, and maintaining stimuli. In addition, addictive behaviors can become more difficult, to treat, or modify as other reinforcers become less effective or important in the lives of the behavers (Crowley, 1972).",

      "abstract": "The term hysterical psychosis has been in common usage for longer than half a century, but it has never become part of the standard nomenclature. Indeed, there is no single article in the literature in which hysterical psychosis as an entity is described and the subject discussed. We have set down how the term is used to provide a fixed point of reference for support or criticism. Our conceptualization of the process is essentially in agreement with Freud's formulation in his second article on the neuropsychoses insofar as we view the disturbance as a form of ego disruption. Descriptively, hysterical psychosis is marked by a sudden and dramatic onset temporally related to a profoundly upsetting event or circumstance. Its manifestations include hallucinations, delusions, depersonalization and grossly unusual behavior. Thought disorders, when they occur, are usually sharply circumscribed and very transient. Affectivity, if altered, is changed in the direction of volatility and not flatness. The acute episode seldom lasts longer than one to 3 weeks, and the eruption is sealed off so that there is practically no residue. Hysterical psychosis is encountered most commonly in persons referred to as hysterical characters or personalities when faced by trying life situations or problems. Statements received from correspondents were consistent generally with our viewpoint. Case notes have been presented to illustrate certain aspects of the clinical picture.",

However PCS is often difficult to diagnose using routine clinical, neuroimaging or laboratory evaluations, while CTE currently only can be definitively diagnosed postmortem. We sought to develop an animal model to simulate human repetitive concussive head injury for systematic study. In this study, mice received single or multiple head impacts by a stereotaxic impact device with a custom-made rubber tip-fitted impactor. Dynamic changes in MRI, neurobiochemical markers (Tau hyperphosphorylation and glia activation in brain tissues) and neurobehavioral functions such as anxiety, depression, motor function and cognitive function at various acute/subacute (1-7 day post-injury) and chronic (14-60 days post-injury) time points were examined. To explore the potential biomarkers of rCHI, serum levels of total Tau (T-Tau) and phosphorylated Tau (P-Tau) were also monitored at various time points. Our results show temporal dynamics of MRI consistent with structural perturbation in the acute phase and neurobiochemical changes (P-Tau and GFAP induction) in the subacute and chronic phase as well as development of chronic neurobehavioral changes, which resemble those observed in mTBI patients.",

      "abstract": "Diseases with movement disorders may be difficult to diagnose, both at the onset, when motor symptoms are mild and not sufficiently specific (e.g., difficulty in manipulating objects), or at end stage when distinctive motor signs are diluted in a severe and polymorphous clinical picture (eg, gait disorder with postural instability and cognitive decline in aged patients). Erroneous diagnoses are not infrequent, even in the most common disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). [1] Some of these errors may be avoided if the cognitive dysfunctions that often accompany these diseases are included in the diagnostic criteria.\n\nIn general, the cognitive disturbances found in movement disorders are in the category of ``subcortical dementia,'' consisting of a frontal lobe-like syndrome, without genuine amnesia or impairment of instrumental functions (aphasia, apraxia, or agnosia). Except for a few illnesses, such as essential tremor and idiopathic dystonia, in which intellectual deterioration is absent, subtle but specific cognitive deficits can frequently be detected in patients with a variety of diseases accompanied by movement disorders. [2] This is explained by the neuronal pathways connecting the basal ganglia to the cortex projecting not only to regions involved in the control of movements (motor, premotor, supplementary motor areas) but also to cortical areas contributing to cognitive functions (prefrontal cortex). In each of these diseases, the loss of different specific populations of neurons in the basal ganglia produces not only a characteristic motor syndrome but also a recognizable pattern of neuropsychological deficits. The use of appropriate neuropsychological tests to detect these deficits can therefore contribute to the diagnosis of such diseases.\n\nThis brief review will not deal with disorders caused by subcortical lesions of nondegenerative origin (tumors, sequelae of trauma or stroke, inflammatory and metabolic disorders, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, etc.) or with easily identified neurodegenerative diseases, i.e., when motor disability is prominent …",

      "title": "Developmental Neuropsychiatry",
      "abstract": "Abstract Neurodevelopmental disorders are a group of conditions involving alterations of behaviour, thinking, and emotions. They have onsets in early childhood, persistence into adult life, and high rates of altered cognitive and neurological function. They are frequent reasons for referral to psychiatry, paediatrics, and clinical psychology and often require team approaches to meet a variety of needs for service. This book includes accounts of the typical development and possible pathology of key functions whose alterations can underlie problems of mental development: motor function, attention, memory, executive function, communication, social understanding and empathy, reality testing, and emotional regulation. It goes on to descriptions of frequent clinical conditions: the spectra of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism, tic disorders, coordination and learning difficulties, intellectual disability, and the psychotic disorders of young people. There are descriptions of recognition, diagnosis, prevalence, pathophysiology, and consequences for later development. These conditions very often coexist and present as dimensions rather than categorical illnesses. The effects of brain disorders on mental life are then considered, with special attention to epilepsy, cerebral palsy, hydrocephalus, acquired traumatic injury to the head, localized structural lesions, and endocrine and genetic disorders. Widely used treatments, both psychological and physical, are described in the context of their value for meeting multiple, often overlapping needs. Consequences of the conditions for individuals’ psychosocial development are described: stigma; physical illness and injury; economic disadvantage; and family, peer, and school stresses. This book is aimed at clinicians of all disciplines, clinical students, and educators encountering neuropsychiatric problems in young people.",

This compression takes place particularly as the nerve traverses some 'naturally tight ' passages, and it can be aggravated by the presence of some aberration in local anatomy. Such phenomena frequently have some dynamic composite; that is, they are manifested or intensified after some repetitive movements or in some specific position of nearby articulations.",

      "abstract": "Traumata, by definition, refer to exterior events that expose a person to experiences of overwhelming threat and catastrophe and elicit feelings of death anxiety, panic, horror, helplessness, loss of personal control, and intractability. Most affected persons respond with at least some distressing symptoms of trauma-related memory intrusions, autonomic hyperarousal, dissociation, and depression in the acute aftermath. Fortunately, the majority of traumatized individuals succeed in coping with this major stress quite well during the following weeks and months unless the process of recovery is hampered by additional adverse psychosocial circumstances, psychological disposition or biological vulnerability. In a subgroup of persons a transition to acute and posttraumatic stress disorder or other major psychiatric disorders, e.g. depressive, anxiety, substance-related disorders may be observed. Posttraumatic stress disorders very often run a chronic course of illness enduring for many years or even life-long. The typical course of illness in PTSD is characterized not only by major psychiatric comorbidities contributing to a dramatically reduced health-related quality of life, to many deficits of psychosocial adaptation and a heightened suicide risk. It is also associated with a lot of major somatic health problems both in acute and long-term stages. The main focus here is on this special dimension of physical comorbidities in posttraumatic disorders. Empirical evidence underscores that trauma exposure, and in particular PTSD is significantly associated with major physical health problems in addition to well-known PTSD-related psychological, behavioural, and psychosocial impairments. Both self-report-based and objective assessments emphasized significantly increased rates of somatoform/functional syndromes and physical comorbidities, premature all-cause and specific mortality rates, heightened medical utilization behaviours, major socioeconomic costs, and reduced health-related quality of life in the aftermath of trauma exposure and posttraumatic stress disorders, thus defining a major challenge to any medical care system. Complex psycho-behavioural-somatic and somato-psycho-behavioural models are needed to better understand both acute and long-term effects of a perpetuating stress system on physical health.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenic psychosis is rare in patients below 15 years of age. Early diagnosis is crucial as the illness is likely to have a poor outcome: indeed, duration of untreated psychosis may exert a negative influence on the prognosis. Thus, it may be highly relevant to recognise premorbid changes of character traits, behaviour and cognitive problems which are reflected in worsening school performance. For example, some 40 to 50% of the children who later develop a psychosis will show social withdrawal, loss of interest in age-appropriate activities, peculiar or immature responsiveness, increasingly suspicious, fearful or depressive states, baseless despair, unusual somatic complaints, concentration problems, cognitive and linguistic disabilities, and peculiar motor movement disorders such as bizarre, ritualistic behaviour, mannerisms, stereotypies, echopraxia. These features are non-specific: they can but need not represent the early signs indicating later development of schizophrenia. They should be evaluated in terms of potential psychosocial, genetic and somatic pre-, peri- and postnatal risk categories. During the child's development these features may build up to constitute vulnerability and stress factors that may lead to psychotic breakdown. Early age of onset correlates with high social disability scores. Complete remission is an extremely rare event in patients with gradual-insidious onset of psychosis.",

It is part of borderline personality disorder (a disorder characterized by emotional lability and ill‐considered, self‐harming acts); antisocial personality disorder (characterized by rash, ill‐thought out acts that often harm others); attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (characterized by difficulty waiting one's turn and persevering on tasks); bulimia nervosa (characterized by binge eating and subsequent purging); alcohol and drug‐use disorders; and a whole set of impulse‐control disorders, such as kleptomania, pyromania, and intermittent explosive disorder.

Both young and old people are affected, as a result of traffic or sports accidents as well as due to falls at home. The term TBI encompasses various clinical pictures, differing considerably in cause, prognosis and therapy. What they all have in common is the pathophysiological cascade that develops immediately after the initial trauma and which can persist for several days and weeks. In this phase, medical treatment, whether surgical or pharmacological, attempts to reduce the consequences of the primary damage. The aim is to maintain adequate cerebral perfusion pressure and to reduce intracranial pressure.Das Schädel-Hirn-Trauma (SHT) bezeichnet eine durch äußere Gewalteinwirkung bedingte Schädigung des Gehirnparenchyms. Es verursacht massive individuelle und sozioökonomische Folgen aufgrund der hohen Morbidität und Mortalität.

Der Begriff SHT umfasst mehrere Krankheitsbilder, die sich in Ursache, Prognose und Therapie unterscheiden.

Difficulty in expression and control of aggression are central issues in character disorders.",

In addition, persons with insomnia are at higher risk of developing a new psychiatric disorder, particularly major depression, within a year of the onset of insomnia. Psychiatric disorders can give rise to insomnia, excessive sleepiness, or parasomnias (eg, nightmares or sleep terrors) (Boxes 11–1 and 11–2).. It has been estimated that a third to a half of cases of chronic insomnia are associated with a psychiatric condition. Changes in sleep architecture include a decrease in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep latency that is seen with depressive episodes, schizophrenia, and borderline personality disorder. Schizophrenia (psychosis) is a chronic psychiatric disorder characterized by both “positive symptoms” (eg, hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized speech and behavior) and “negative symptoms” (eg, affective flattening, avolition [limited goal-directed behavior], and alogia [restricted thought and speech production]). This disabling condition has a median age of onset between 15 and 25 years of age. Course is chronic with significant impairments in self-care, interpersonal interactions, and work performance.",

      "abstract": "‘Auto-activation’ deficit, the most severe form of apathy, is a model to approach apathy. Auto-activation deficit consists of a severe reduction in self-initiated actions contrasting with the sparing of externally driven ones under strong solicitations and the presence of automatic (stereotypic) behaviour. This severe apathy can be viewed as the consequence of a quantitative reduction of goal-directed behaviour. Auto-activation deficit is due to lesions in the prefrontal cortex (PFC)–basal ganglia circuitry, the brain system that generates and controls goal-directed behaviour. In this chapter it is proposed that several different mechanisms may be responsible for apathy. Damage to three PFC–basal ganglia circuits may explain most of the cases of apathy: (i) lesions in the orbital and ventromedial PFC–basal ganglia circuit lead to apathy through difficulties in evaluating the affective value of a given behavioural context (‘amotivation’); (ii) lesions in the lateral PFC–basal ganglia circuit contribute to apathy via an inability to generate or activate strategies required to successfully complete a given programme of actions (‘cognitive inertia’); (iii) lesions to the anterior cingulate cortex–basal ganglia circuit (located in an intermediary anatomical position between the ventral and lateral circuit) may lead to apathy via an inability to transfer the affective value of a given context (‘invigoration deficit’); (iv) the summation or the synergy of damage to these three circuits within the basal ganglia may lead to a frank decrease in the amplification of signals representing goal-directed behaviour that reach the PFC (‘empty mind’); and (v) if all three circuits are structurally intact, apathy may nevertheless occur via alterations of neurotransmission systems that modulate the activity of these circuits (i.e. dopamine, serotonin, and acetylcholine).",

An hypothesis is proposed suggesting that motion sickness is triggered by difficulties which arise in the programming of movements of the eyes or head when the relations between the spatial frameworks defined by the visual, vestibular, or proprioceptive inputs are repeatedly and unpredictably perturbed. Such perturbations may be produced by certain types of motion, or by disturbances in sensory input or motor control produced by ingested toxins. The last would be the important cause in nature, the main function of the emesis being to rid the individual of ingested neurotoxins. Its occurrence in response to motion would be an accidental byproduct of this system.",

Injury at or above the sixth thoracic spinal cord segment frequently leads to dysregulation of the autonomic nervous system, which results in a syndrome called autonomic hyperreflexia or dysreflexia. It is a hypertensive crisis triggered by visceral or somatic stimuli below the level of the injury and caused by sympathetic spinal reflexes not modulated by regulatory centers in the brain. Patients with spinal cord injuries frequently undergo surgery for multiple reasons. Because of the potentially lethal complications of autonomic hyperreflexia, physicians, and in particular anaesthesiologists, must be aware of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and adequate perioperative management.Les lésions de la moelle épinière peuvent avoir de nombreuses conséquences autres que la perturbation des fonctions sensitives et motrices.

The adaptive changes that occur are coordinated and mediated by the stress system in the central nervous system (which includes corticotrophin-releasing hormone and noradrenergic neurons in the hypothalamus and brainstem, respectively), and its peripheral limbs, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the autonomic (sympathetic) system. Controlled or self-driven challenges to homeostasis and a normally functioning stress system are crucial for normal development and preservation of self and species. In childhood and adolescence, appropriately functioning neuroendocrine responses to stressors are necessary to allow growth and psychosexual maturation to progress normally. Maladaptive neuroendocrine responses, i.e. dysregulation of the stress system, may lead to disturbances in growth and development and cause psychiatric, endocrine/metabolic and/or autoimmune diseases or vulnerability to such diseases, not only during childhood and adolescence, but also in adulthood.",

      "abstract": "SIR–In their recent article1 Kim and Park fail to deal with the entirety of Dr Lance’s classical definition of spasticity.2 His carefully drafted statement documented the consensus of the 1979 symposium of 44 actively engaged neurological investigators (including me): ‘Spasticity is a motor disorder characterized by a velocity-dependent increase in tonic stretch reflexes (‘muscle tone’) with exaggerated tendon jerks, resulting from hyperexcitability of the stretch reflex, as one component of the upper motor neuron syndrome. This did not preclude discussion of other features of the upper motor neuron syndrome resulting from release of flexor reflexes, such as flexor spasms, or the negative symptoms such as the pattern of weakness and loss of dexterity caused by withdrawal of the influence of descending motor pathways.’2 Thus spasticity is not a subjective symptom like headache or diplopia. It is rather an objective observation of the professional examination, like a cardiac murmur or a dilated pupil. There is abundant evidence that the truly disabling negative symptoms, often more impaired dexterity than strength, are directly correlated with the degree of disconnection of the target motor neuron population from the complexly integrated control of forebrain and hindbrain nerve structures. This loss of fine control and force is neither augmented by antagonist muscle stretch reflexes3 or improved by systemic medication, fusimotor blockade,4 or dorsal rhizotomy.5 Nor is the degree of clumsiness directly correlated with the prevalence of spasticity.6 The Ashworth Scale has never been more than an amateur parascientific game, with personal impressions of stiffness and absent replicable physical parameters. Recently, Fleuren et al. 7 have gone to the trouble of proving that the Ashworth Scale is worthless. Occam’s razor requires cessation of the senseless and useless demonization of the spasticity epiphenomenon. Absent evidence-based potions, patients should be assisted to practice toward maximal autonomous function.",

Emotional dysregulation, impulsive aggression, repetitive self-injury, and chronic suicidal tendencies make these individuals frequent users of mental health services. BPD has a variety of causes and involves several factors which interact in various ways with each other. Emotional dysregulation and impulsivity can be caused by genetic factors and traumatic childhood experiences and lead to dysfunctional behaviors, psychosocial conflicts, and deficits that may exacerbate emotional dysregulation and impulsivity. BPD has been linked to anatomical alterations in brain areas in the prefrontal cortex, cingulate cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, hypothalamus, corpus callosum, and frontolimbic network. These brain changes can lead to the manifestation of the inability to control behavior, feelings, and interpersonal relationships, which often leads to violence. These symptoms may begin at a young age or in early adulthood and tend to continue as the individual ages. The goal of this article is to review how structural changes in the brain can cause BPD.

      "abstract": "• Weakness or paresis, particularly for voluntary movements, is the most prominent sign of a stroke resulting from damage to the descending According to the American Heart Association, approx-imately 500,000 new strokes occur each year, with approximately three million existing stroke survivors. Hand motor impairment is especially common and contributes enormously to the ensuing disability. How-ever, the relationship between hand motor impairment and hand function remains unclear because much of the improvement in function occurs due to compensation rather than true recovery of impairment. Hand motor impairment in the production of finger movements and fingertip forces after stroke may be viewed as 1) a deficit in motor execution, resulting from weak-ness, spasticity, and abnormal coactivation of muscle groups during isolated movements (muscle synergies), and/or 2) a deficit in higher-order processes, such as motor planning and motor learning, which lead to poorly formed sensorimotor associations or internal representations that lead to impaired motor control. The treatments depend on the view taken. These include strengthening of weak muscle groups and reduction in spasticity in spastic muscles, to restore the balance between agonist and antagonist muscle groups for the former view and intense task-specific practice with the affected hand, with or without constraint of the unaffected hand, bimanual practice, action observa-tion, and motor imagery for the latter. However, there is no clear consensus on the nature of hand motor impairment or how best to treat it to promote true recovery. The present review attempts to clarify the nature of hand motor impairment after stroke and discusses the available evidence for treatment strate-gies to address these.",

Studies after the terror attacks of September 11, 2001, in New York City and the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing and countless reports on the impact of natural disasters on children show that a child's mental health can suffer from direct and indirect exposure to these events. Children may react to a disaster or act of terrorism in a variety of ways. These reactions are influenced by age, developmental level, intellectual capacity, individual and family support systems, personality, and other factors. Common manifestations of psychological trauma in young children include regression, clinging behavior, inattentiveness, aggressiveness, bed-wetting, somatic complaints, irritability, social withdrawal, nightmares, and crying. Longer-lasting effects may include depression, anxiety, adjustment disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, and interpersonal or academic difficulties. Some children are particularly vulnerable to postdisaster trauma because of preexisting psychosocial stressors (homelessness, foster care, exposure to violence, etc), low socioeconomic status, or special needs (including cognitive delays and prior mental illness). These postdisaster reactions may not manifest until well after the event and could persist for years.\n\nThe National Center for Disaster Preparedness (NCDP) at Columbia's Mailman School of Public Health gathered key staff to discuss the appropriate response to the needs in the Gulf Coast region. Over the following few days, talks were held with federal, state, and local public officials to assess immediate needs and determine what resources could be offered to the affected areas. Necessary clearances to provide medical care were obtained from the Louisiana, Mississippi, and Texas departments of health. Permission was also necessary (and obtained) for access to gasoline and necessary supplies including pharmaceuticals and to travel after curfew.\n\nThe Children's Health Fund and the NCDP launched Operation Assist, a collaborative effort to organize programs … \n\nAddress correspondence to Paula A.

A sindrome da crianca hipotonica engloba as condicoes em que a hipotonia muscular se manifesta no recem-nascido ou nos primeiros dois anos de vida. Sua idade de inicio e gravidade do quadro clinico apresenta desde o nascimento como frequencia no encontro de dificuldade alimentar e respiratoria e nao sao superadas as etapas do DNPM, ou sao superadas com muito atraso, apresentando fraqueza muscular: falta de resistencia a movimentacao passiva e grave retardo do desenvolvimento motor; (CURY & BRANDAO et al, 2011); definir a hipotonia; citar as causas da patologia; apresentar os problemas associados; apontar os objetivos do tratamento e citar alguns tipos de tratamento fisioterapeutico. O estudo de caso clinico teve inicio no dia 18 de Marco de 2014, na clinica escola Ninota Garcia, com um total de 10 sessoes de tratamento. Paciente com diagnostico clinico de cirurgia de coracao e diagnostico fisioterapeutico de Hipotonia fazendo com que ocorresse atraso no desenvolvimento motor. Foram utilizadas as seguintes palavras-chave: Fisioterapia, na crianca hipotonica e atraso no desenvolvimento motor. Um dos objetivos de tratamento fisioterapeutico pelo qual o paciente foi submetido foi de influenciar o tonus muscular (CARREGARO et al, 2011); Adquiriu um resultado significativo apresentando entao controle crânio-caudal e suas estabilidades das articulacoes e de suas determinadas estruturas, sendo eficaz no controle e limitacao do movimento, suportando cargas de tensao melhorando toda influencia de tonus muscular. Ganho de amplitude de movimento (CURY & BRANDAO, 2011); com rotacao medial, abducao/aducao, flexao/extensao dos MMSS, com o objetivo de obter ou manter (ADM) maxima das articulacoes. Alongamento (SYLLOS et al, 2008); de peitoral maior, menor e medio com objetivo de desencadear um aumento da flexibilidade muscular sendo a maior amplitude de movimento possivel.   Essa revisao permite concluir que o tratamento fisioterapeutico e de extrema importância no tratamento da crianca hipotonica, pois foi constatada uma evolucao do paciente adquirindo controle de cabeca, mudancas de decubito e melhora na estabilidade de tronco.",

Jitteriness is often accompanied by other signs of central nervous system excitation, such as hypermotility, hypertonicity, and ease of startle. It must be differentiated from myoclonus and seizure, although they may coexist. Jitteriness can be caused by a variety of pre-, peri-, and postnatal insults, and it is the nature and treatability of these, rather than the tremor itself, that are the major determinants of the ultimate prognosis. \"Coarse\" tremor is probably more often abnormal than \"fine\" tremor, and appears to bear some relationship to the later development of a choreiform syndrome. The evaluation of the jittery infant must be individualized and management aimed at reversing any remediable causes.",

      "abstract": "Most people who suffer serious traumatic brain injury (TBI) have a period of loss of consciousness and post-traumatic amnesia that typically means that they do not recall the moment of injury itself. They may also have a gap in memory stretching from some time prior to injury to some time after the injury. Therefore despite going through the traumatic experience of a motor vehicle accident or assault or fall the individual may have no recollection of the incident itself. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mood disorder characterized by re-experiencing (flashbacks, nightmares), avoidance and arousal symptoms (e.g. hypervigilance) in relation to having experienced, witnessed or been confronted by an event involving death or serious injury that results in feelings of fear, helplessness or horror (American Psychiatric Association, 2000). In the context of amnesia for the traumatic event, the question as to whether PTSD can occur after TBI, has been the subject of some debate (Sbordone and Liter 1995; Bryant et al. 2000; Williams et al. 2002; Sumpter and McMillan 2006). However, it is generally accepted now that, through various different mechanisms, PTSD can occur after TBI (Bryant, 2001). Some people who suffer a closed head injury have partial recall of the incident (Creamer et al. 2005) with some experiencing specific ‘islands’ of memory for traumatic events (King, 1997).",

      "title": "Role of Sertraline in insomnia associated with post traumatic brain injury (TBI) depression",
      "abstract": "Abstract Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of disability (1, 2). Sleep disturbances, such as insomnia, are very common following traumatic brain injury and have been reported in frequencies from 40% (3) to as high as 84% (4). Sleep disruption can be related to the TBI itself but may also be secondary to neuropsychiatric (e.g., depression) or neuromuscular (e.g., pain) conditions associated with TBI or to the pharmacological management of the injury and its consequences. Post-TBI insomnia has been associated with numerous negative outcomes including daytime fatigue, tiredness, difficulty functioning: impaired performance at work, memory problems, mood problems, greater functional disability, reduced participation in activities of daily living, less social and recreational activity, less employment potential, increased caregiver burden, greater sexual dysfunction, and also lower ratings of health, poor subjective wellbeing. These negative consequences can hamper the person’s reintegration into the community, adjustment after injury, and overall QOL. (5) The connection between depression and insomnia has not been investigated within the post TBI population to a great extent. For the general population, clinically significant insomnia is often associated with the presence of an emotional disorder (6). Fichtenberg et al. (2002) (7), in his study established that the strongest relationship with the diagnosis of insomnia belonged to depression. Given the high prevalence of depression during the first 2 years following TBI (8), a link between depression and insomnia among TBI patients makes innate sense. The present study aims at assessing role of sertralline in post TBI insomnia associated with depression.",

Spasticity is a chronic pathological condition in spastic forms of cerebral palsy. Spasticity is defined as speed-dependent increased resistance to passive muscle stretching, as inappropriate involuntary muscle activity associated with paralysis of the central motor neuron. Increased muscle tone limits the volume of active and passive movements, promotes the development of secondary musculoskeletal complications. Pharmacotherapy of spasticity syndrome in pediatric neurological practice is an urgent problem due to the restriction of their use in childhood, the lack of studies with a high level of evidence.",

      "title": "Effects Of Stress In Early Life",
      "abstract": "Abstract International adoptees encounter stress both prenatally and postnatally (Table 8–1). Most are products of unwanted pregnancies. After birth, many suffer from abandonment, institutionalization, malnutrition, recurrent illnesses, environmental deprivation, and/or emotional neglect. Some are physically or sexually abused, or witness distressing events. These stressful experiences in early life may permanently alter brain physiology and lead to long-lasting physiological, psychological, and behavioral changes. Early stress may have lifelong adverse effects on growth, development, health, behavior, learning, and memory. This section discusses how stress influences these areas, clinically and neurobiologically.",

      "title": "Time dependent differences in gray matter volume post mild traumatic brain injury",
      "abstract": "When the brain is subjected to excessive physical forces, including blunt impact, high-speed rotation, or blast overpressure waves, its tissue structure and function can be compromised, leading to traumatic brain injury (TBI). Based on the level of structural and functional damage, these injuries can be classified as mild, moderate, or severe, with mild TBI (mTBI) being by far the most common. Also known as concussion, mTBI frequently occurs in a wide variety of activities, including accidental falls, sports injuries, moving vehicle accidents, military training, and combat related events such as blast exposure. mTBI can lead to various cognitive, sensory and motor complaints like reduced memory, attention, and information processing speed, and emotional dysregulation (Carroll et al., 2004). Most individuals with mTBI will recover from these symptoms within 90 days post injury (Karr et al., 2014), but for some individuals, the symptoms may be protracted, persisting up to a year or longer (Satz et al., 1999). For a small minority of individuals, these cognitive and emotional symptoms are severe enough to significantly affect social and occupational functioning. In contrast to moderate and severe injuries, one of the defining features of an mTBI is the absence of detectible structural lesions on a standard clinical imaging scan. While individual lesions may not be present, there is emerging evidence that, as a group, patients with mTBI may actually be differentiated from non-injured controls based on brain volume data. For instance, previous studies have shown decreased gray matter volume (GMV) post mTBI, suggesting a loss of cortical neurons (List et al., 2015). Very few studies, however, have explored differences in GMV at different time intervals post mTBI and their relationship with neuropsychological performance. Such research is crucial to understanding the recovery process because the brain is not static and neuroplastic remodeling may continue for some time after an injury. Understanding this relationship can facilitate better-targeted intervention strategies to aid in rehabilitation following mTBI. We recently reported findings suggesting that mTBI may not simply be associated with reduced cortical volume, but instead may show specific increases in gray matter volume (GMV) as well (Killgore et al., 2016). In that project we studied the cortical volume changes and their association with neuropsychological task performance at various time intervals up to a year following injury. We used a 3.0 Tesla magnetic resonance imaging scanner (Siemens Trim Trio, Erlangen, Germany) with a 32-channel head coil for our study. A T1 weighted 3D MPRAGE sequence (TR/TE/flip angle = 2.1 s, 2.3 ms, 12°) was used to acquire 176 sagittal slices (256 × 256 matrix) with a 1-mm slice thickness, yielding a voxel size of 1 × 1 × 1 mm3. The VBM8 toolbox in SPM8 (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm8/) was used to process the T-1 weighted structural images. All images were spatially realigned to the anterior-posterior commissure axis and then segmented into GM, WM, and CSF using VBM8. A custom DARTEL template was created using the segmented images and then the images were normalized to Montreal Neurological institute (MNI) space. Images were then smoothed with a 10 mm full width at half maximum (FWHM) isotropic Gaussian kernel. The study participants included 26 right-handed adults (age range 20–45 years, mean age 23.38 ± 5.23, 11 males, 15 females), with English as their primary language. All participants had a history of sports-related mTBI experienced within the 12 months prior to participation this study (2 weeks [n = 2], 1 month [n = 6], 3 months [n = 5], 6 months [n = 10], 1 year [n = 3]). All of these participants sustained mTBI while engaging in sports activities such as rugby (n = 7), basketball (n = 3), softball (n = 1), ultimate frisbee (n = 1), soccer (n = 1), ice hockey (n = 2), lacrosse (n = 1), martial arts (n = 2), weight lifting/gym (n = 4) and track and field (n = 4). The participants were initially screened over the telephone for the details of their head injury, medical and psychiatric history. Participants were ruled out for any serious chronic medical, neurological or psychiatric condition like hypertension, diabetes, epilepsy, bipolar disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder etc. The only exception was depression and anxiety developing after the concussion. Also, they were required to provide official documentation of head injury signed by an impartial but professionally responsible witness to the head injury or its immediate consequences (e.g., physician, nurse, ambulance driver, medical records, neuropsychologist). Additionally, 12 healthy control participants (age range 20–43 years, mean age 25.00 ± 6.55, 4 males, 8 females), with no history of head injury or loss of consciousness were recruited as a comparison group. On the day of visit, the healthy and mTBI individuals underwent same series of neuropsychological assessments and MRI sequences. Remarkably, in contrast to the general finding of reduced GMV following mTBI found in other studies, our results did not show such reductions, but instead showed that longer time since injury (TSI) was associated with increased GMV in two brain regions (see Figure 1), including the cortex of the right fusiform gyrus (RFG) and bilateral ventromedial prefrontal cortex (VMPFC). In other words, the cortex of these regions appeared to be larger among those whose injuries were most distal in time. Moreover, larger GMV was associated with better performance for visual motor, visual attention, and emotional functioning tasks, suggesting that greater cortical volume in specific regions was associated with better functional outcome. We speculate that these data point toward significant cortical remodeling occurring in the months following injury. To further evaluate that possibility, we divided our sample roughly in half so that we could compare those in the post-acute stage (0–99 days post-injury) to those in the chronic stage (100–365 days post-injury), and further compared them to a separate sample of healthy individuals with no reported history of head injury. Consistent with our hypothesis, the chronic group showed significantly greater GMV in both regions compared to the post-acute group, confirming that gray matter was increased with longer TSI. Moreover, the chronic group also showed significantly greater GMV compared to the healthy controls, suggesting that not only was the GMV returning to normal with greater TSI, it was actually exceeding the volume seen in healthy normals. Thus, for these individuals, the later stages of recovery were associated with exaggerated GMV in specific regions that are involved in regulating emotion as well as sustaining visual attention and information processing speed.Figure 1: Regions where larger gray matter volume was significantly correlated with time since injury, including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the right fusiform gyrus.L: Left; R: right; A: anterior; P: posterior; VMPFC: ventromedial prefrontal cortex; FG: fusiform gyrus.We interpreted these findings as evidence of experience dependent cortical plasticity. In other words, we propose that for many individuals, mTBI leads to a host of subtle core cognitive impairments and emotional regulation deficits post-injury, which over time, lead the injured individual to draw upon these other cortical regions to compensate. For example, reduced frustration tolerance and emotional dysregulation are common experiences after mTBI and are not specific to a particular lesion site (Ryan and Warden, 2003). It is conceivable that individuals with these emotional difficulties may more routinely activate the ventromedial prefrontal cortical regions, which play an important role in emotional and visceromotor regulation, in an attempt to maintain emotional control. Similarly, many people experience slowed processing speed and attentional difficulties following a concussion (Levin et al., 1987). This may cause such individuals to draw more heavily upon regions such as the fusiform gyrus and other visual attention regions in order to compensate. With sustained and exaggerated use, it is conceivable that these highly exercised regions may begin to develop larger cortical volume through more extensive dendritic arborization. It is well established that repeated practice with certain motor or cognitive skills can lead to an increase in specific cortical regions supporting that skill (Quallo et al., 2009). The preliminary findings from our study are encouraging, suggesting that mTBI is not uniformly defined by decreased cortical volumes. On the contrary, regional increases in volume are possible within this population and these volume changes are associated with improved cognitive and emotional functioning. The fact that we identified specific regions of volume increases is remarkable given the fact that mTBI is an extremely heterogeneous injury, with multiple potential causes and diffuse locations of damage (Bigler, 2008). The fact that these areas of increased volume were consistent and focal suggests that they are likely independent of lesion location—rather they likely reflect common pathways for compensation that are relatively independent of the site of impact or location of damage. Previous studies have shown that behavioral experience interacts with regenerative and degenerative changes in the brain to induce structural and motor plasticity (Kerr et al., 2011). Compensatory remodeling is one of the ways neuroplasticity works and may undergird the mechanisms behind rehabilitative training, which forms one the mainstays of treatment post mTBI. On the basis of our findings we suggest that rehabilitative training might be even more beneficial if it can capitalize on this aspect of neuroplasticity. Perhaps by focusing rehabilitation efforts toward exercising existing compensatory skills that draw upon these regions (e.g., emotional regulation; regulating attention from distraction), patients can further develop the cortical volume of those regions and, over time, gain greater functional capacity. This would be encouraging and suggest that there is more that could be done for patients recovering from concussions than merely to “wait and see.” Clearly this is speculative at this point, but further research should examine whether the cortical volume, structural and functional connectivity, and functional capacity of these same regions can be voluntarily enhanced in patients recovering from mTBI via focused training. Finally, it will be important for future work to focus efforts toward using functional neuroimaging. This will enable linkage among the cognitive tasks and identified deficits caused by an injury and the regions of increased gray matter volume identified in our study. The present study was supported by a USAMRAA grant to WDSK (W81XWH-12-1-0386).",

      "abstract": "Motivation – the capacity to experience enthusiasm for achieving a goal, which helps to initiate, guide and maintain behaviour – is a fundamental psychological process that serves to enable both survival and thriving in the face of challenge. Loss of motivation can have a debilitating impact on everyday function, resulting in difficulty working, studying and taking care of responsibilities at home; and, in extreme cases, a total loss of motivation results in the absence of any behaviour at all. Disrupted motivation can be expressed through a variety of clinical symptoms, including apathy, anhedonia and fatigue, which tend to cluster together. These motivational symptoms are very common, occurring across a broad range of neuropsychiatric conditions, for example depression, schizophrenia and Parkinson’s disease, but as yet we have no specific treatments for them. This chapter provides an introduction into research into the neuroscientific and psychological mechanisms underlying motivation, which has yielded important information regarding the key brain circuity and cognitive operations involved. There are several key messages. (i) Motivation is a multifactorial construct, comprising several distinct cognitive operations, and dysfunction in any one of these has the potential to result in motivational symptoms.",

      "title": "Infant Precursors to Autism",
      "abstract": "Autism is a neurodevelopmental condition that is typically diagnosed in childhood or later. However, its high heritability and patterns of expression of implicated genes may contribute to an onset in fetal or early infant brain development. Prospective studies of infants with a family history of autism or a genetic syndrome associated with higher prevalence are providing insights into the earliest manifestations of the condition. Contrary to earlier expectations, the earliest signs of autism in the first year of life appear to be in sensory and motor development. Prospective studies have identified overgrowth of sensorimotor brain cortices, reduced habituation to repeated auditory or tactile stimuli, and exaggerated pupillary responses to changes in luminance in the first year of life. These are followed by a gradual decline in visual attention to faces and eyes, and the emergence of early social signs such as reduced pointing and sharing, or reduced communication. Altered patterns of behavior (including focused interests and unusual play) also emerge in the second year. These changes are associated with alterations in brain oscillatory power and connectivity. Autism is often associated with other co-occurring conditions; differences in broader aspects of development such as sleep or fearfulness also emerge early in development, and relate to later cognitive and adaptive outcomes. Parental interventions that focus on supporting and following a child’s interests can support social communication development for some infants.",

      "title": "Compulsive Masturbation Treated with Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors",
      "abstract": "Masturbation can be defined as a person's achieving sexual pleasure which usually results in orgasm by himself or herself (autoeroticism). Masturbation is a normal activity that is common in all stages of life from infancy to old age, but this viewpoint was not always accepted. Freud believed that neurasthenia was caused by excessive masturbation. In the early 1900s, masturbatory insanity was a common diagnosis in hospitals for the criminally insane in the United States. Masturbation is abnormal when it is the only type of sexual activity performed in adulthood, when its frequency indicates a compulsion or sexual dysfunction, or when it is consistently preferred to sex with a partner [1]. Compulsive masturbation does not have a distinct code in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition D.S.M.-V (2013) but can be classified as other specified sexual dysfunction [2]. The I.C.D.–10 classifications (W.H.O., 1992) ha ve a diagnostic category termed “excessive sexual desire” and compulsive masturbation may fall into this category [3]. Compulsive sexual behavior has been characterized as a behavioral addiction and an obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorder. It has been quantified using the statistic of total sexual outlet (number of orgasms/week). People with compulsive sexual behavior referred for treatment generally show a total sexual outlet of >7 [4]. Early psychological injury, from sexual abuse, physical abuse, exposure to violence, attachment trauma, or early sexualization, is at the root of sexually compulsive behavior [4,5]. Compulsive sexual behavior frequently has associated comorbidities of current mood disorders 33%, anxiety disorders 42% , substance disorders 29% and Personality disorders 46% [6,7]. Physical injury in compulsive masturbation is common. Patients with this disorder may masturbate 5-15 times a day and loneliness is felt keenly after an orgasm. This disorder can interfere in occupational, social, interpersonal, and intimacy functioning. Many different agents have been cited in case reports as helpful in treating compulsive sexual behavior: lithium, buspirone, tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), atypical antipsychotics, naltrexone, and topiramate have all been reported to be helpful in treatment of sexual compulsivity [4].",

      "abstract": "Whiplash is a contentious issue in the medico-legal field; opposing views are held about persisting symptoms. The exact pathology is not known; but it is generally accepted to be ‘soft tissue injury’. The same clinical syndrome can occur without a road accident. No one doubts the reality of the condition in the early stages when the symptoms and signs (of a ‘mechanical derangement’) are clear cut. As with other soft tissue injuries, most ‘heal’ within a usual time span; some take longer to heal; and some have persisting problems giving rise to chronic pain, restricted movements &/or a feeling of ‘instability’. In this latter group the physical signs are less obvious but are still present, if sought. Imaging is rarely relevant. The psychological reaction to any injury or illness will vary from individual to individual (the previous personality); or from time to time in the same individual. People with chronic pain may become depressed and may develop ‘excessive’ psychological reactions – often referred to as ‘chronic pain syndrome’ and, by some, as ‘abnormal illness behaviour’; this is exacerbated when litigation is involved with its attendant adversarial, confrontational approach which questions the ‘genuineness’ of both the patient and their symptoms and disability. Where symptom persist beyond the ‘usual’ time for healing, and are consistent with the (albeit subtle) physical signs found, there can be no grounds for arguing that they are nor related to the accident.",

      "abstract": "Dissociative identity disorder (multiple personality) is increasingly diagnosed, often follows childhood trauma, and is characterized by rigidification of phenomena that resemble hypnosis. To interpret dissociated aspects of selfhood as autonomous entities is a useful heuristic; but when taken too literally, it leads to three kinds of anomaly: (1) legal: dissociators remain culpable for misdeeds carried out beyond apparent awareness or control; (2) clinical: legitimization sometimes leads not to relief, but to escalating cycles of regressive dependency; and (3) scientific: the form of dissociated entities varies with how they are defined, in ways that are intrinsically motivated and clinically manipulable. These anomalies yield to an evolutionary perspective that views dissociative identity disorder as an evolved strategy of adaptive deception of self and others; e.g., a beaten subordinate avoids further retribution by \"pleading illness.\" Such a deceit best avoids detection when fully experienced; through its intensity and persistence, it becomes real at a new level. One's basic competencies remain intact, however, and are the source of the anomalies described. They can be clinically accessed and empowered, providing the key to therapeutic change when dissociative processes are problematic. Overall, despite clear impairment in subjective awareness and volition, dissociative-disordered individuals are best held fully accountable for the consequences of their actions.",

      "title": "A CONTRIBUTION TO THE NOSOLOGY OF THE IMPULSE DISORDERS",
      "abstract": "We have presented certain clinical pictures typified by a disorder of impulse. This disorder may express itself in a rather specific symptomatic disturbance appearing as an impulse neurosis, a perversion, or a catathymic crisis. On the other hand, the disturbance may be more diffuse and nonspecific, pervading the total personality and behavior of the individual, expressing itself in a character disorder. In the impulsive character disorder we sometimes find evidence of a relationship to organic factors. However, there is another large group belonging to the impulsive character disorders which does not show such evidence of organicity and yet is characterized by the same infantile, explosive, impulsive behavior seen in the former. In surveying the genetic and dynamic factor, it is apparent that no one factor in and of itself determines the development of an impulse disorder. Constitutional factors, early developmental experiences, present-day forces and stresses impinging upon the individual contribute to the efficacy of the control apparatus or to the strength of drive. Constitutionally, varying drive and control potentials, physiologically as well as psychologically, interweave with early developmental experiences. Among the latter are psychological ones such as oral traumata possibly leading to an intolerance of frustration with demands for immediate gratification. Interference with speech-action relationships may result in the latter persisting as the medium of communication, thus leading to a tendency toward acting out. Physiologically, illness and physical traumata may increase the strength of the drives or weaken the control apparatus. The constitutional and early developmental experiences may lend a quality of impulsivity to the character, which in the face of current forces and stresses may result in impulsive behavior. Specific early experiences may supply the clinical clothing which envelopes the impulse skeleton leading to either direct or distorted expression of a given early impulse. The result is a wide array of clinical syndromes, which have as their common denominator an impulse disorder.",

In this labor are shown the consequences of stress experiences on children, for example a serious threats to life, natural catastrophies (e.g. earthquake) and violent events. The results of traumatic events on emotional state or behavior of child may be short term or long term, anyway they affect development. Events like natural disasters, wars, rapes are traumatic for all people, but chlidren may almost equally be affected by separation, abusing, divorce, death of parents and testifying against abusers or parents. Posttraumatic stress disorder is the most recognizable manifestation of state caused by trauma. Traumatic event is relived on different ways: through frequently recalling events and flashbacks of that experience, avoiding of situations related with trauma, appearing of general insensitivity, that manifests as losing of interests for important activities, impossibilty of emotional binding and sense of isolation from others. The simptomes of posttraumatic disorder are: increased arousal, irritability, anxiety, difficulties with concentration, overemphasized shock. Quality relationship parent-child, support that child had in family before the traumatic experience and current support from social surroundings may be protection factors and prevent occurrence and advancemenet of negative trauma effects.",

      "title": "Spinal reflex organization in early development: Electrophysiological measures and proposed motor pathways",
      "abstract": "The delay in developmental milestones in cerebral palsy (CP) is presumed to result from a nonprogressive insult to the developing central nervous system (CNS). In CP, the site(s), type, duration, and magnitude of CNS insult(s) may never be defined, and a single focus of damage may not be revealed by standard brain imaging methods. The neurological examination (i.e., assessment of reflexes, tone, and motor coordination) generally does not define the insult with precision, nor can it predict the delays in motor skill development. The CNS damage may only be suspected from the medical history during the prenatal or perinatal period; confirmation of CNS insult may be deferred until the child misses developmental milestones in the first few months or years of life. In CP, patterns of motor incoordination and delay emerge gradually over time during development. While the original CNS injury is presumed to be a nonprogressive insult to higher motor centers (e.g., cerebral motor cortex), the damage probably causes significant modulation of functional neural connections during maturation of the brain and spinal cord. Such aberrant communication in motor pathways may be caused by, or result in, motor incoordination. In turn, repetition of uncoordinated movements may reinforce aberrant neural connections with, or at, the spinal cord. In this paper, we review neural responses to stimulation of sensory and motor systems and compare data for healthy neonates and children, and children and adults with CP. Age-related differences are identified in measured onset latencies of responses, computed central conduction delays, and relative levels of excitatory drive. Differences in muscle responses are shown among subject groups for myotatic reflex activation of agonist, antagonist, and more distant limb muscles. From these data, inferences have been made that, in CP, impairments in CNS circuitry may include descending corticospinal pathways and/or spinal reflex pathways (e.g., “reciprocal excitation”). Data from a number of investigators support the theory that changes in spinal reflex pathways are likely to play a fundamental role in the development of motor control.

His soldiers from the Union Army developed intolerable pain in an extremity after a penetrating wound causing partial interruption of a major nerve. This was characterized by intense burning pain in the area supplied by the injured nerve. The pain, evoked by the lightest touch, has the peculiar characteristic of becoming agonizingly severe with emotional stimuli and exposure to cold (or tropical heat, as observed by Denny-Brown in Burma). Trophic changes develop with glossy skin and atrophy from disuse. The so-called minor causalgia results from nonpenetrating and often relatively mild trauma to an extremity, most often the wrist, hand, or ankle.

Suicide may be the end-point of a number of different contributing factors. It is more likely to occur during crisis periods associated with upheavals in personal relationships, through alcohol and drug abuse, unemployment, clinical depression and other forms of mental illness. Because of this, suicide is often used as a proxy indicator of the mental health status of a population. However, the number of suicides in certain countries may be under-reported because of the stigma that is associated with the act, or because of data issues associated with reporting criteria (see Definition and comparability).",

      "abstract": "SummaryThe amount of tension in the muscular skeleton system is dependent on personality, physical constitution, longlasting recurrent or actual psychosomatic problems and learned behavior. Muscular tension becomes a coping mechanism to deal with somato-psychical and social difficulties. The literature shows possible biochemical correlations with states of depression, and also an impaired serotonin metabolism. However, not all patients suffer from depression. Further, a depressive, depressive-hypochondric state, and/or state of anxiety can be a consequence of fibromyalgia pain. Impaired non-REM sleep and a disturbed system of pain-modulation in the middle brain and brain stem, and a decreased tolerance of frustration, as well as frustrated aggression are assumed to be responsible for muscle contraction.In about 90% of the patients with fibromyalgia, psychoneuroses of different kinds have been found in which an impaired self- as well as an insufficient body awareness (partly as a consequence of the lasting pain) nearly always play a role. There are also significantly more life events and more problems compared to patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Four different strategies exist for therapy: 1) administration of antidepressive drugs; 2) relaxation: a) using drug therapy with benzodiazepines or meprobamate; b) with passive or, preferably, active physical therapy, resulting in physical strengthening, and leading also to an improved self-confidence c) autogenic training. 3) antirheumatic drug (for pain relief); 4) cognitive psychotherapy, individual and/or group, with the aim of cognitive reorientation, and fostering adequate strategies to cope with pain and problems.",

Dissociation is often defined as partial or total disconnection between memories of the past, awareness of identity and of immediate sensations, and control of bodily movements, often resulting from traumatic experiences, intolerable problems, or disturbed relationships. Etiopatogenezis of dissociative disorders have not exactly known yet. The process of dissociation is independently associated with several distressing conditions such as psychiatric diagnoses, somatization, current psychological distress, and past sexual and physical victimization. The disturbance may have a sudden or gradual onset and may be temporary or chronic in its course. Dissociation has a negative impact on treatment oucome. Additionaly, dissociative patients may have an insecure attachment pattern negatively affecting the therapeutic relationship. Conceptually, the course of treatment is to improve coping, maintain reality, and establish normal integrative functions. Goals: 1. improve thought processes; 2. maintain a sense of reality; 3. improve coping skills; 4. develop stress management abilities; 5. increase identity integration. The treatment is possible with psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy or both. We will introduce the CBT approach. Participants will learn: • pharmacological possibilities in the treatment of dissociative disorders; • CBT model of dissociative disorders; • motivational interviewing with dissociative patient; • how to develope therapeutic relationship with dissociative patient; • conceptualization of dissociative disorder with the patient; • Socratic questioning; • working with cognitive, emotional and behavioral avoidance; • exposure technique with dissociative problems; • problem solving.

      "title": "Spinal cord injury-induced cognitive impairment: a narrative review",
      "abstract": "Spinal cord injury is a serious damage to the spinal cord that can lead to life-long disability. Based on its etiology, spinal cord injury can be classified as traumatic or non-traumatic spinal cord injury. Furthermore, the pathology of spinal cord injury can be divided into two phases, a primary injury phase, and a secondary injury phase. The primary spinal cord injury phase involves the initial mechanical injury in which the physical force of impact is directly imparted to the spinal cord, disrupting blood vessels, axons, and neural cell membranes. After the primary injury, a cascade of secondary events begins, expanding the zone of neural tissue damage, and exacerbating neurological deficits. Secondary injury is a progressive condition characterized by pro-inflammatory cytokines, reactive oxygen species, oxidative damage, excitatory amino acids such as glutamate, loss of ionic homeostasis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and cell death. This secondary phase lasts for several weeks or months and can be further subdivided into acute, subacute, and chronic. One of the most frequent and devastating complications developed among the spinal cord injury population is cognitive impairment. The risk of cognitive decline after spinal cord injury has been reported to be 13 times higher than in healthy individuals. The exact etiology of this neurological complication remains unclear, however, many factors have been proposed as potential contributors to the development of this disorder, such as concomitant traumatic brain injury, hypoxia, anoxia, autonomic dysfunction, sleep disorders such as obstructive sleep apnea, body temperature dysregulation, alcohol abuse, and certain drugs. This review focuses on a deep understanding of the pathophysiology of spinal cord injury and its relationship to cognitive impairment. We highlight the main mechanisms that lead to the development of this neurological complication in patients with spinal cord injury.",

      "title": "Trofinetide receives FDA approval as first drug for Rett syndrome",
      "abstract": "Introduction Rett syndrome (RTT) is a neurodevelopmental illness affecting around 1 in every 10,000 live births, almost exclusively affecting females1. RTT's key traits are aberrant linguistic and psychomotor growth (it refers to abnormal or deviating patterns of development in language skills and motor coordination, this deviation may manifest as atypical linguistic abilities and challenges in developing motor skills), autistic behaviors, erratic breathing, uneven walking, and hand wringing2. The early postnatal period saw regular neurological and physical growth, which leads to symptom emergence between 6 and 18 months of age3. The four phases of the RTT progression (Table 1)3 are Stage 1 (early onset), Stage 2 (regression), Stage 3 (plateau), and Stage 4 (late motor deterioration). In Stage 1 (early onset), children grow normally, albeit there may be some developmental delay. Stage 2, known as regression, sees youngsters regress and lose previously learned abilities, such as deliberate hand gestures and spoken speech. Children's cognitive skills stabilize at Stage 3 (plateau) when other medical issues start to manifest themselves like seizures. People with RTT endure declining mobility in Stage 4 (late motor degeneration), and they may start to exhibit parkinsonian symptoms4. Table 1 - Rett syndrome evolves via various phases3 Stage Age Symptoms 1. Stagnation 6–18 months Developmental delays (postural control, motor, language)Reduced eye contactHand-wringing may occurMicrocephaly may occur 2. Rapid regression 1–4 years Loss of purposeful hand skillsStereotypical hand movements (wringing, washing, tapping)Loss of spoken languageWalking may be unsteadyBreathing irregularities may occurAutistic-like featuresMicrocephaly progressionSeizures may occur 3. Plateau/pseudo-stationary 2–potentially life Hand apraxia/dyspraxiaMotor coordination difficulties and/or loss of motor skillsImprovement of communication skills may occurSeizures are common 4. Late motor deterioration 10–life Severe physical disabilityMuscle weakness, rigidity, or spasticityWheelchair dependency may occur The RTT brain has a diminished volume comparable to that of an ideal 1-year-old kid. RTT is associated with a reduction in brain volume, particularly affecting regions such as the frontal and temporal lobes. The diminished volume observed in individuals with RTT is often characterized by a loss of neurons and a decrease in dendritic branching. Specific brain areas like the cerebral cortex, which plays a crucial role in various cognitive functions, may exhibit reduced size and altered structure. This abnormality contributes to the neurological and developmental challenges associated with RTT. It is stable for at least 40 years without exhibiting any signs of neurodegeneration. Patients with RTT exhibit abnormal movements during pregnancy and the first year of life, which can result in microcephaly. It is thought that the primary reasons are imbalances in dendritic arborization, synaptic density, neuronal soma size, and increased cell density5. Several patients have impaired brain carbohydrate metabolism, dyslipidemia, raised plasma leptin and adiponectin, abnormal mitochondrial structure, raised oxidative stress, lactate and pyruvate levels, GI issues, altered QT intervals, diminished bone mass, osteoporosis, gallbladder inflammation, scoliosis, urological dysfunction, and sleep disruptions. The fact that several tissues and systems are involved emphasizes the fact that RTT is a multi-systemic illness6. Pathogenesis of Rett syndrome An X chromosome-linked gene called Methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2) produces the MeCP2 protein, which plays an essential role in the RTT7. MeCP2 is highly produced in the nucleus and is essential for the differentiation, maturity, improvement of neural circuits, and maintenance of synapses. Early in the embryonic process, it is low. MeCP2 has two primary isoforms, MeCP2-E1 and MeCP2-E2, distinct by amino (N)-terminal amino-acid residues8. MeCP2 has two conserved domains: transcriptional repression and methyl-DNA binding7. Because of its affinity for methylated CpG sites linked to transcriptional silence, MeCP2 was first recognized as a repressor9. However, when it binds to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, a frequent alteration of DNA in the brain that is concentrated in active genes, it has also been proposed as a transcription activator10. In RTT, C > T type nucleotide transition mutations are found in CpG hotspots and most likely represent variable site methylation in the male germline. Only female progeny can be affected by RTT mutations, which develop spontaneously in the paternal germline cells11. More than 200 distinct MeCP2 mutations have been linked to RTT. R106W, R133C, T158M, R168X, R255X, R270X, R294X, and R306C are the most prevalent point mutations, accounting for nearly 60% of RTT instances4. Microarray research revealed that WNT6 mRNA levels were 12-fold reduced in the CA1 zone of the hippocampus of MeCP2K412R sumo mutant mice (MeCP2 Lys-412 residue sumo-mutant animals)12. Wnt proteins and the Wnt/-catenin pathway are crucial for proper brain development. It has also been emphasized as a hotspot for autism signaling. Wnt6 signaling dysfunction and its downstream effectors may be involved in the etiology of RTT, as evidenced by decreased MeCP2 SUMOylation and reduced Wnt6 mRNA levels in MeCP2K412R sumo-mutant animals7. Treatment of Rett syndrome Old treatments Due to its multi-systemic dysfunction, RTT requires a multifaceted strategy for medical therapy and management13. Patients die as a result of heart failure, pulmonary infection, or respiratory collapse6. The majority of treatment techniques aim to stimulate MeCP2 gene expression and control its downstream mechanisms. Actinomycin-D suppresses MeCP2 repression, Tamoxifen restores MeCP2 expression, IGF-1 tripeptide improves life expectancy in MeCP2 mutant mice, and Valproic acid is an HDAC blocker that serves to treat seizure disorder14. Ketamine administration bettered limb clasping, muscle control, and breathlessness in MeCP2-mutant mice. Desipramine, a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, alleviated MeCP2-mutant mice's ventilation abnormalities and apneas. Sarizotan, a serotonin 1a agonist and Dopamine D2-like receptor agonist, lowered breathlessness by 15–30% but had no influence on motor function in MeCP2-mutant mice3. Fluoxetine and buspirone had positive effects on respiratory dysfunction in RTT cases. Levodopa and benserazide administration alone refined RTT traits, dendrite growth, spine density, and lifespan. Choline therapy bettered motor efficiency, grasping power, nerve cell growth and behavioral impairments in RTT mouse models14. Vitamin E derivative Trolox alleviates neural cells hyperactivity while also increasing synaptic remodeling and hypoxia tolerance. N-acetylcysteine modulates oxidative stress by increasing intracellular glutathione levels in MeCP2/y mice15. Fluvastatin and Lovastatin restore cholesterol metabolism, Phenytoin prevents arrhythmias, Zoledronic acid treats osteoporosis and lowers the incidence of fractures, Folate and Betaine recover RTT morphology by promoting DNA methylation of CpG binding proteins. Dextromethorphan is an NMDA receptor blocker entirely for mental functioning and convulsions, while Topiramate TPM therapy improved seizure control and respiratory function in RTT patients. Levetiracetam is a powerful anticonvulsant medication for RTT patients, whereas Naltrexone is an opiate blocker used orally that boosts breathing efficiency but has little impact on the anticipated psychomotor handicap13,14. New treatments Trofinetide Trofinetide, an oral medication sold under the brand name Daybue, has just received FDA approval for the treatment of RTT, an uncommon gene-related disorder that impairs neurological growth, in adults and children 2 years of age and older. Before 10 March 2023, there were no FDA-endorsed treatments available for RTT, with the primary focus on managing the syndrome's symptoms and impacts through a multidisciplinary and interprofessional approach. Trofinetide became an inaugural FDA-approved treatment for RTT on 10 March 2023. Trofinetide (glycyl-L-2-methylprolyl-L-glutamic acid) is a brand-new synthetic analogue of the brain protein glycine-proline-glutamate (GPE). Vomiting and diarrhea are frequent side effects of the twice-daily oral medication, according to an FDA statement16. Diminution in weight, Fever, convulsions, anxiousness, reduced satiety, exhaustion and nasopharyngitis are some of the additional adverse effects. Trofinetide's mechanism of action in RTT patients remains unclear. Trofinetide has been found in animal research to promote dendritic branching as well as neuronal plasticity signals17. In a phase 2 placebo-controlled trial involving 82 female mice with RTT aged 5–15 years, trofinetide, exhibited promising results. In MeCP2-deficient mice, GPE improves neurological, pulmonary and cardiovascular performance, as well as heart rate, increases brain mass and lengthens survival. Both GPE and Trofinetide, which has a prolonged half-life than GPE, halted cell death and decreased infarct volume in a rat model of hypoxic insult, with Trofinetide showing a dose-dependent decrease in infarct volume18. The highest trofinetide dose (200 mg/kg twice daily [BID]) showed a significant improvement (P ≤ 0.042) over the placebo on three key measures: the RTT Behavior Questionnaire (RSBQ), Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I), and RTT-Clinician Domain Specific Concerns-Visual Analog Scale (RTT-DSC-VAS). The mice tolerated trofinetide well at all doses tested (50, 100, and 200 mg/kg BID). Encouraged by these findings, a phase 3 trial is now underway, employing disease-specific and innovative scales to further investigate the efficacy and safety of trofinetide in female mice with RTT18. Variations in Trofinetide bioavailability between morning and evening doses may have significant clinical implications. This information may guide the development of more personalized treatment plans, considering chronobiological factors and tailoring doses to align with the symptomatology patterns. Optimizing dosing schedules could potentially enhance the efficacy of trofinetide in managing RTT. However, ensuring patient adherence is crucial and requires education on the importance of consistent dosing. In addition, regular monitoring and potential adjustments in dosage timing based on individual responses may be necessary to maintain stable therapeutic effects. Overall, a deeper understanding of trofinetide bioavailability changes throughout the day could refine treatment strategies to achieve better outcomes in patients with RTT19. In a phase 2 study, trofinetide was administered orally twice daily in three weight-based dosages (50 mg/kg, 100 mg/kg, or 200 mg/kg) for 6 weeks to 82 children and adolescents with RTT. The 200 mg/kg dose significantly improved efficacy measures as determined by care takers and medical professionals20. Oral trofinetide administration resulted in linear kinetics in early clinical pharmacokinetic studies (including population pharmacokinetic modeling in healthy adult participants), with no time- or dose-dependent effects on pharmacokinetic parameters. Trofinetide did not induce or inhibit any metabolic processes during the dose range that was the subject of the study (up to 200 mg/kg), and systemic exposure was dose-proportional throughout. Following administration of numerous doses, there was little to no buildup. Trofinetide's bioavailability was found to change between morning and evening doses in these early tests, which may have been caused by a dietary effect or circadian oscillations in metabolism or absorption. In the population pharmacokinetic modeling study, a two-compartment model best represented the pharmacokinetic parameters of Trofinetide; nevertheless, noncompartmental analysis is often preferred for characterizing pharmacokinetics in a single study. Concurrent food consumption may alter the pharmacokinetic profile of orally delivered medications by a variety of methods, such as postponing stomach emptying, altering the gastrointestinal tract's pH, or altering a drug's luminal metabolism. The main goal of the current investigation was to identify any potential interactions between food and Trofinetide pharmacokinetic parameters after oral administration of patients with RTT at the highest recommended clinical dose (12 g). Trofinetide's pharmacokinetic characteristics were compared between morning and evening administration in order to identify any potential diurnal fluctuation in bioavailability. The study's second exploratory goal was to describe the pharmacokinetics of Trofinetide in urine. The selection of weight-based dosages in a phase 2 study is often grounded in determining the optimal balance between efficacy and safety across a diverse patient population. By tailoring dosages to different weight categories, researchers can assess how variations in body weight influence drug responses and potential side effects. This approach helps identify appropriate dosage ranges for further investigation, aiming to establish a more personalized and effective treatment strategy for a broad spectrum of individuals within the target population21. Conclusion The approval of Trofinetide as the first drug for RTT is a significant breakthrough for families affected by this rare and debilitating condition. For many years, there has been no cure for RTT, and treatment options have been limited to managing the symptoms of the condition. Trofinetide offers hope that some of the cognitive, behavioral, and language impairments associated with RTT can be improved. While Trofinetide is not a cure, its approval by the FDA represents a major milestone in the development of treatments for RTT. The drug has undergone rigorous clinical testing and has been shown to be safe and effective for improving some of the symptoms of the condition. It will be available in two formulations, offering flexibility and choice to patients and their families. Looking ahead, it is hoped that further research will continue to refine and improve the effectiveness of Trofinetide and that additional treatments will be developed to address the underlying causes of RTT. However, for now, the approval of Trofinetide represents a significant step forward in the treatment of RTT and offers hope to the many families affected by this condition.

Neurodegenerative diseases are often categorized by symptoms that may include impairment in cognition, movement, strength, coordination, sensation, or autonomic control. However, the diagnosis of a specific neurodegenerative disease may be misleading, as there is both clinical and neuropathologic overlap among diseases and existing diagnostic tools are not always accurate.

      "title": "Assisting Veterans with mTBI/PTSD",
      "abstract": "Concussion, also called mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), is a diffuse non-penetrating head injury caused by a sudden external force, such as during contact sports or a blast in combat.1 When a sudden force moves the brain rapidly inside the close confines of the skull, it creates chemical changes, inflammation, stretching and shearing of axons, improper cell function, and cell death. This injury is often not visible on medical imaging, but it disrupts micro-second temporal computations critical for signal decoding and speech processing. Common symptoms of concussion/mTBI include cognitive impairment, attention deficits, difficulty concentrating, headaches, visual problems, anxiety, depression, irritability, and sleep disturbances. Loss of consciousness is not required for the diagnosis of concussion. However, repeated concussive or sub-concussive events, especially with loss of consciousness, can result in greater severity of the symptoms.PTSD, mental health, hearing lossFigure 1: Audiograms of veterans with mTBI and/or PTSD.Table 1: Counseling Strategies for Veterans with mTBI and/or PTSDGenerally, the symptoms resolve within three months. Some individuals, however, may continue to experience symptoms for a year or more.2 About 50 percent of individuals with a single mTBI exposure demonstrate long-term cognitive impairment and other symptoms that can interfere with returning to work or school.3, 4 Concussions, especially from blast injuries, can also damage the auditory system. The human ear is designed to be sensitive to changes in pressure; therefore, it is the organ most susceptible to pressure changes created by a blast wave. Auditory symptoms reported with mTBI or concussion include difficulty understanding speech in quiet and in noise, difficulty attending to sounds or ignoring distracting sounds, tinnitus, hyperacusis, and balance problems.1 Events that cause mTBI may result in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a psychiatric disorder that can occur in people who have difficulty recovering from experiencing/witnessing a traumatic physical or emotional event. The persistent mental and emotional distress can last over a month.5 Individuals who experienced a traumatic event that did not trigger PTSD are at an increased risk for PTSD in the future.6 Many military veterans experience multiple episodes of mTBI, which set them at a higher risk for PTSD. Between 2000 and 2018, roughly 315,897 cases of mTBI, many of which caused by blast-related injury, were confirmed across all branches of the U.S. military.7 About 20 percent of U.S. military veterans are affected by PTSD.5 Veterans with combined mTBI and PTSD show exacerbated symptoms of decreased attention, working memory/memory deficits, executive function deficits, and hypervigilance.8 It is important to raise awareness of common behaviors and test discrepancies observed in veterans with mTBI and/or PTSD so hearing health professionals can better diagnose and counsel these patients. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS Many veterans receive audiologic care outside of the Veteran's Administration Medical Center (VAMC). Our university clinic is under a contractual agreement with different veteran service groups to provide compensation and pension audiologic assessments. A subset of the veterans assessed in our clinic exhibited normal or mild pure-tone thresholds while self-reporting a much more significant hearing loss. These findings were consistent with a recent study that found that among 87 percent of veteran participants with mTBI who reported hearing loss, nearly two-thirds fell within the “normal hearing” range.9 Comorbid hyperacusis with mTBI and PTSD was common in our clinic population, which created practical problems during assessments. In some cases, when assessing acoustic reflex thresholds (ARTs), results were either inaccurate, or the test could not be completed when the louder reflex tones elicited significant physical discomfort and/or anxiety resulting in muscle tension. Clinicians need to be vigilant in recognizing these behaviors because veterans often do not disclose hyperacusis or report any discomfort. Conversely, some veterans appeared to tolerate the ART assessment, but demonstrated sound sensitivity during pure tone evaluation to levels below those used to assess ARTs. Other issues confounding diagnosis were incomplete or unavailable medical history at the time of the appointment and veterans not always reporting combat-related injuries, mTBI, and/or PTSD. CASE STUDIES These three cases exemplify the type of case histories, behaviors, and audiometric test results observed in the veteran population in our clinic. These three veteran patients men between 22 and 55 years old. Audiometric evaluations were performed according to the test procedures required by VAMC and using insert earphones in a sound booth. The veterans’ middle ear status was normal as determined via tympanometry and ARTs. Word recognition scores (WRS) were determined at 40 dB SL re: speech recognition threshold (SRT) in quiet. The Stenger test was performed as needed according to the VAMC protocol. Veteran A reported a history of blast exposure, multiple concussions (>6), with reported loss of consciousness on several occasions. He reported having hearing difficulty, needing closed captioning for TV, and requesting frequent repetitions from communication partners. Figure 1A shows veteran A's audiogram. His WRS were excellent at 92 percent for the right ear and 100 percent for the left. These results were not consistent with Veteran A's subjective hearing loss. He was previously diagnosed with PTSD. Veteran B reported a history of blast exposure and concussion. He reported having constant bilateral tinnitus, as well as difficulty communicating in noise and understanding his wife. He tolerated the ART assessment, but had anxiety and sensory overload during the hearing evaluation, which increased the test administration time. He needed the lights to be dimmed in the sound booth and test suite during the test. He also needed a water break to recuperate. Figure 1B shows his audiogram. The WRS were excellent at 92 percent for the right ear and 96 percent for the left, which were not consistent with Veteran B's subjective hearing loss. He denied having PTSD. Veteran C reported a history of blast injury and head injury from a service-related fall. He reported requiring multiple repetitions of verbal information and missing information because of an inability to notice that he was being spoken to. He demonstrated high anxiety levels during the hearing evaluation. He denied having hyperacusis repeatedly, but became increasingly anxious as the stimulus levels for the ART assessment increased to >90 dB HL. Contralateral acoustic reflex thresholds for the higher frequencies could not be determined because the test had to be discontinued due to patient discomfort. The WRS were good at 84 percent for the right ear and 80 percent for the left. Figure 1C shows Veteran C's audiogram. The WRS were lower than expected based on age and pure tone thresholds. The veteran believed that he had PTSD, but had yet to be diagnosed. COUNSELING VETERANS WITH MTBI/PTSD Simply validating perceptual hearing problems can be significant for some veterans. Emphasizing counseling during and after the audiometric evaluation can provide a gateway to a veteran's whole-person health care and encourage the patient to seek additional services for mTBI and/or PTSD. Unless clinicians ask the appropriate questions, it is easy to overlook mTBI/PTSD as an underlying cause of a veteran's problems. Useful counseling strategies are shown in Table 1. Audiologists need to be aware that the hearing complaints of veterans with mTBI or PTSD may actually be non-auditory behavioral, emotional, and cognitive/attention issues that can confound diagnosis and raise suspicion of non-compliant behaviors or non-organic hearing loss. Comprehensive assessment of the peripheral and central auditory and vestibular systems, including speech-in-noise testing, and tinnitus assessment may be necessary. Guiding veterans’ understanding that hearing goes beyond the peripheral auditory system is important to validating any perceived hearing problem. This will also help them be more responsive to counseling and other intervention services. Thoughts on something you read here? Write to us at [email protected]",

      "title": "Paroxysmal Kinesigenic Dyskinesia as the Initial Symptom of Hashimoto Encephalopathy",
      "abstract": "Paroxysmal dyskinesias are a rare heterogeneous group of conditions manifesting as abnormal involuntary movements that recur episodically and last only for a brief duration. The abnormal movements may be dystonic, choreic, ballistic, or a mixture of these [1,2]. Such conditions can be divided into three types: paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia (PKD), paroxysmal nonkinesigenic dyskinesia, and paroxysmal exercise-induced dyskinesia [3]. Generally speaking, these dyskinesias are primary forms. They often occur in adolescence and respond well to antiepilepsy drugs such as phenitoin or carbamazepine. Some of these patients have a family history. Apart from these primary forms, there still are so-called secondary (\"symptomatic\") paroxysmal dyskinesias, which are often caused by environmental factors or other diseases [4]. Hashimoto encephalopathy (HE), presently known as Steroid Responsive Encephalopathy associated with Autoimmune Thyroiditis (SREAT), is a potentially fatal disease. Its manifestations are quite variable. Two distinct forms have been described: one was a vasculitic type characterized by multiple relapsing-remitting stroke-like episodes and mild cognitive impairment; the other was a diffuse progressive type characterized by dementia and psychiatric symptoms [5,6]. Antineuronal antibodies were thought to be associated with the pathogenesis of HE [7]. Recently, we encountered a patient whose symptoms began with PKD and finally culminated in global confusion and dementia. He was diagnosed with HE, and recovered completely after steroid treatment. A 75-year-old man was admitted to the Department of Neurology in October 2011. His wife and other family members reported that he began to develop involuntary movements on the left limbs 5 months ago. They noticed the symptoms for the first time while he was having lunch. When he wanted to take up the bowl on the table, he could not control his left arm and hand. The arm made a choreic and ballistic gesture, so he threw his bowl away. At first, this symptom occurred 2–3 times daily. Gradually, the frequency and amplitude increased day after day. They noticed that the attack was always induced by a sudden voluntary movement, for example getting up quickly to answer the telephone, or crossing the road while the traffic lights became green, but it never occurred during sleep. This condition was limited on the left side for nearly three months. He had seen doctors for several times and was prescribed carbamazepine for several days; however, this therapy could not stop the attacks. The frequency even increased to 120–150 times daily before admission. In the mean time, his family members noticed he became \"stupid\" and silent. He could not answer simple questions and could not even recall familiar people and places. On admission, physical examinations showed normal body temperature, breath rate, heart rate, and blood pressure. Neurological examination was remarkable for mild lethargy and unclear speech. He was unable to cooperate when tested for comprehension, orientation, memory, and calculation. Cranial nerve functions were intact. Muscle strength was normal and Babinski sign negative. There were no signs of meningeal irritation. Routine haematological results, including cancer markers, peripheral antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, cytoplasmic antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, antiphosphalipid antibody, antinuclear antibody, rheumatoid factor, systemic lupus erythematosus, serum Vitamin B12, and folic acid were normal or negative. His liver and kidney functions were unremarkable. Blood work for infectious diseases (Epstein–Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, simplex virus, Herpes zoster virus) was negative. The free thyroxine T3, T4, and TSH in the blood were normal. B-type ultrasound examination showed normal gland without nodes or calcification. His dynamic EEG for 24 h showed generalized slow waves (Figure 1), there was no focal or lateralized spike or sharp-slow waves throughout the whole recording period. The brain MR imaging, including T1, T2, and DW were all normal (not shown). Before treatment, dynamic EEG demonstrated diffuse low and medium-amplitude voltage, with the background of theta-activities. There was no sharp or spike-slow waves throughout the recording period. A lumbar puncture showed mild increase in protein 900 mg/L (normally, 150–450 mg/L), with normal cell count and glucose. The IgG, IgA, and IgM in the cerebrospinal fluid was 116 mg/L (normally, 10–50 mg/L), 18.9 mg/L (normally, 0–11.1 mg/L), and 1.4 mg/L (normally, 0–11.1 mg/L), respectively. The antithyroidglobulin antibody and the anti-TSH antibody were normal in the blood; however, the antithyroid peroxidase antibody was significantly elevated (more than 340 IU/mL), which decreased to 179.82 IU/mL after 1-month treatment. After excluding infectious diseases and Creutzfeldt–Jacob disease, HE was considered. He was administered methyprednisolone 500 mg, IV, once a day, for 15 days, 250 mg for another fortnight, and then tapered gradually till 20 mg prednisone, thrice a day. Ten days after steroid treatment, his consciousness began to improve, and the frequency of dyskinesia began to decrease; 20 days after treatment, the PKD symptom completely disappeared. Thereafter, progressive clinical improvement was observed. On the previous day of his discharge, the EEG showed normal (Figure 2). After treatment for 1 month, routine EEG demonstrated medium-amplitude voltage, with the background of alpha-activities. This is the first report of HE, which begins with PKD to our knowledge. PKD is often primary (genetic or idiopathic), which occurs at the age between 5 and 20 years and responds well to antiepilepsy drugs. However, Blakeley et al. found that a specific cause had been identified in some cases. These causes include peripheral trauma, central trauma, vascular lesions, multiple sclerosis, menigovascular syphilis, and kernicterus [7]. Such secondary dyskinesias were easily controlled with anticonvulsant therapy, requiring only one agent. What is different in our patient is that his PKD could not be stopped, because it is unresponsive to carbamazepine or other antiepilepsy drugs, such as valproate, or clonazepam. Further, it is just the initial symptom of the whole course. As the disease progressed, other mental disorders such as global confusion and lethargy predominated over the clinical aspects. The clinical features, laboratory findings, and his responsiveness to steroid treatment are in complete accordance with the revised criteria for SREAT made by Castillo et al. [8]. The pathogenesis and etiology of HE has not yet been identified. Currently, the most broadly accepted hypothesis is that an autoimmune etiology results in either cerebral vasculitis or direct injury from autoantibodies [8]. Although we could not see any abnormalities in the MR imaging, there must be some subcellular changes in the brain, at least some functional disturbance, as seen in the EEG before treatment. Zhao et al. performed brain biopsy in a patient and found reduced density of cortical tissue with neuron loss, swelling of surviving neurons, reactive gliosis, and angiogenesis. Transmission electron microscopy showed vacuolar degeneration of some neurons with swollen mitochondria and microglia activation. Formation of small cysts, demyelination, and sponge-like changes within white matter were also found [9]. However, Castillo et al. performed brain biopsy in two patients, and found the histological findings were entirely normal in one patient, with only meningeal thicking and dural enhancement [8]. In conclusion, this report is interesting and has important clinical significance. Facing a patient with PKD, which is not responsive to antiepilepsy drugs, and especially if the patient undergoes progressive global confusion, clinicians should consider the possibility of HE. The elevated antithyroid antibodies in the serum, especially anti-TPO antibody, are important markers in evaluating this condition. The authors have no conflict of interest.",

      "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains a major health challenge and affects the young disproportionately. Accidental and non-accidental TBI in children is a major contributor to morbidity, disability, and death. TBI in this critical period leads to profound neuronal and axonal degeneration followed by cognitive, psychological and memory impairment, altered processing speed, impaired executive functions, emotional liability as well as word finding difficulties. Cognitive and behavioral changes may remain unrecognized for periods even after sustaining mild injury. Although accidental and non-accidental inflicted injury (blunt force or violent shaking-inflicting brain injury or “Shaken baby” syndrome) posits a major clinical and sociological problem, mechanisms of tissue degeneration might be largely similar. The scope of this review will be the experimental research related to modeling blunt (concussive) head trauma specifically to the infant rodent brain resulting in acute (early) and protracted (late) degenerative changes such as axonal degeneration and apoptotic neuronal cell death. Similarly, discussion will be limited to therapeutic windows and potentials for ameliorating the development of early brain injury.",

      "title": "PROTOCOL: Personal assistance for children and adolescents (0‐18) with both physical and intellectual impairments",
      "abstract": "The International Classification of Impairments, Activities, and Participation (ICIDH-2) refers to impairment as loss or abnormalities at the level of body, body part or organ. People may have difficulty performing particular activities as a result of impairments, and a person's participation in education, social life, work, and other areas may be limited as a result of interactions among impairments, activities, and environment (WHO 2003). Though the ICIDH-2 refers to adults, except with reference to studies using specific definitions of other terms, this review follows the classification in ICIDH-2, which does not include the terms disability or handicap. This review will include children and adolescents with both physical impairments and intellectual impairments, which include learning impairments (e.g., Down's syndrome, global developmental delay, or pervasive developmental disorder), learning disability (also called ‘intellectual disability’ or ‘mental retardation’) and acquired brain injuries. Intellectual impairments and physical impairments affect activities and participation differently. Therefore, young people with intellectual impairments only or physical impairments only will be considered in other Cochrane and Campbell reviews, as will working-age adults and older adults. Around the world, about six hundred million people have impairments (UN 1990), most of whom live in the developing world. Previous reviews have identified inconsistencies in the measurement of impairments and activity limitations (UN 1990) and cross-national estimates of impairments and activity limitations in childhood and adolescence are even more variable than national estimates. The prevalence of intellectual impairments is difficult to quantify due to problems in diagnosis and classification. Most children and adolescents with intellectual impairments have mild to moderate impairments. Relatively few have ‘profound’ impairments (DSM-IV R). Over five million (10.6%) American children and adolescents experience a limitation in learning ability; respectively, about 4.0% and 3.2% have moderate and severe limitations (Hogan 1997). Gross rates of impairments in the United States (U.S.) have increased substantially in recent decades as a result of an aging population that is living longer and, more recently, as a result of higher reported levels of impairments among children and young adults (Kaye 1996). Recent increases in the prevalence of impairments among children and adolescents may be a result of changes in medical care. For example, very low birthweight babies are more likely than ever to survive (Alberman 1991; Allen 1993; Doyle 1995). These children are at high risk of both physical impairments and intellectual impairments (Middle 1996; Williamson 1983; Wilson-Costello 2005). Over six million (12.3%) American children and adolescents experience some type of functional limitation (as defined by (Hogan 1997)). Of the four million American children and adolescents who experience one serious functional limitation, about half experience one or more other functional limitations. About one million American children and adolescents experience serious limitations in two or more areas (Hogan 1997). Impairments are more prevalent in boys than in girls (Newacheck 2004) and more prevalent in low-income families than in high-income families (Newacheck 2004; UN 1990). Of non-institutionalised children and adolescents aged 5-17, 1.3% experience limitations in mobility and about .2% experience a moderate or severe limitation in mobility. Respectively, .9% and .5% experience limitations in self care; 5.5% and 1.2% experience limitations in communication (Hogan 1997). About 3.2% of American children attend special schools or classes (Wenger 1995). As far as possible, this review uses internationally accepted definitions of impairments and refers to impacts that are likely to occur across cultures. However, many epidemiological studies have been conducted in the United States and Western Europe. Readers should consider the applicability of epidemiological data to other settings. A discourse of disability ethics has evolved to discuss concepts of independence, defined not as people with disabilities “doing everything” for themselves, but as having maximum control over how help is provided (Morris 2001). Proponents of the social model of disability regard activity restrictions as caused by societal and structural barriers and stress the need for their removal (Abberley 1987; Oliver 1990). In addition to structural and environmental changes (e.g., making buildings accessible), the social model emphasises changes in public attitudes towards impairments to encourage increased participation and improved self-esteem. Participation in age-appropriate activities may be limited for children and adolescents with impairments when physical, social and attitudinal environments restrict their involvement (Hammal 2004; Mihaylov 2004). Impairments in children are related to societal limitation, and different types of impairments contribute uniquely to societal limitations (Hogan et al., 1997). Impairments may affect the quality of life, health, development, and family functioning of children and adolescents (Lavigne 1993; Neely-Barnes 2004; Pit-Ten 2002; Varni 2005). Limited participation in activities may have negative impacts on the mental and physical functioning of children and adolescents and may lead to emotional and behavioural problems. Children and adolescents with intellectual and physical impairments are at increased risk for mental health problems; however, most children and adolescents who might benefit from psychological services do not receive them (Witt 2001). Comorbid problems can also impact carers. For example, challenging behaviour often occurs in the context of learning impairments and mental health problems (Moss 2000). Parents and siblings of children with impairments are at risk for psychological problems (Rossiter 2001; Sharpe 2002; Thyen 1998). Total healthcare costs for children and adolescents with impairments may be four times greater than for those without impairments (Newacheck 2004). However, children and adolescents with impairments require varying degrees of support. For example, in one large study, ‘those in the upper decile of the expenditure distribution accounted for 65% of all charges’. Costs born by families of children and adolescents with the most severe impairments were similarly high; out-of-pocket healthcare expenses (i.e. those not reimbursed by insurance or a health service) for the top 10% of the distribution accounted for 85% of all out of pocket expenses (Newacheck 2004). All children and adolescents require some level of care. However, children and adolescents with extensive impairments may require many hours of assistance every day in addition to the normal assistance required by their peers. Consequently, family members (notably mothers) may withdraw from work and social life. Caring for a child with severe physical impairments can put great financial and emotional stress on parents and families (Neely-Barnes 2004; Witt 2001). In the U.S., parents of children with impairments are less likely to have attended college and more likely to be single and poor (Hogan 1997). The stress of caring for children with impairments may have negative impacts on parents, but some problems associated with impairments may increase the risk of impairment. For example, poor children are less likely than their peers to receive preventive healthcare (Newacheck 1988) and depressed mothers are less likely than other mothers to use injury prevention strategies like car seats and electrical plug covers (McLennan 2000). Furthermore, some evidence suggests that the development of intellectual impairments is affected by sociodemographic factors (Resnick 1998). Low birthweight black babies are more likely than white babies to survive (Morse 2006), which might affect the relative prevalence of impairments in different racial groups; however, ‘controlling for socioeconomic differences and family structure, black children are no more at risk of functional limitation than whites’ (Hogan 1997). Since the causes and consequences of impairments are often difficult to disentangle, retrospective studies are difficult to interpret. Increased participation (inclusion in activities of daily life) may have positive effects on the social functioning, development, mental and physical health of children and adolescents. There are many ways to increase participation by children and adolescents with impairments. For example, school schedules may be designed such that children and adolescents with impairments can engage in age-appropriate activities with their peers. Clinicians and policymakers can work together to influence policy, discourse, and planning and to apply the social model in support of children and their families (Colver 2005). However, broad interventions may not be sufficient to meet all needs. People with severe impairments require interventions tailored to their unique impairments, lifestyles, living arrangements, etc. Assistive devices, skills training, physical therapy, education, and human support help young people control their lives appropriately and engage in normal activities. Personal assistance is support given to children and adolescents with impairments living in normal housing (e.g., family homes or school accommodation) to enable them to participate in mainstream activities in various settings. Personal assistance is directed by users and their representatives and is designed to promote independence and to reduce strain on families. Assistants might help with bathing, dressing, moving around during the day, shopping, etc. Personal assistance is provided by non-professionals; it may aim to improve mental and physical health, but it differs from services by professional healthcare providers (e.g., nurses) with whom users have very different relationships. Personal assistance may be purchased by governments, insurance providers, or individuals. It may be provided directly or indirectly through payments or vouchers. Personal assistance differs from voluntary or charitable services over which users do not have the same control. It also differs from respite care, which is temporary and aims to help carers rather than children and adolescents with impairments. Personal assistance is designed for people whose participation in many normal activities would be impossible without help. While user needs should be assessed periodically, personal assistance is designed for people with permanent impairments. For example, the needs of a person with a recently acquired impairment might be different from the needs of a person who has had an impairment from birth and the needs of both might change; personal assistance would be designed to meet their unique needs and would develop with them. In this way, it differs from rehabilitative services and from services provided for fixed periods of time. Receipt of personal assistance is dependent on the amount of help required by an individual. For example, personal assistance in Nordic countries is generally provided to people requiring at least 20 hours of help per week, though most users have severe impairments and both require and receive substantially more assistance. Some form of personal assistance is now available (often by statutory right) in all Nordic countries, most Western European countries, Australia, parts of Asia, Canada, and the U.S. Services in different countries for different users are called by different names, which often relate to legislative categories rather than types of interventions. Eligibility varies around the world. For example, countries that see services for adults as a ‘right’ may not be able or willing to provide comprehensive services for children and older adults. Services for people of different ages may be provided through different mechanisms. Rules about who may be a personal assistant also vary. For example, some countries allow users to employ family members (e.g., parents) while others do not. Differences in eligibility affect the number and types of people who receive support and these differences affect the amount and types of support individuals and their families receive. That is, the relative number of people receiving personal assistance and their characteristics vary across countries, insurance schemes, etc. Advocates of personal assistance argue that personal assistants should be chosen, trained and managed by users or their representatives. However, the organisation of services and the degree of user control varies around the world and may be affected by the administration of payments, employment laws, etc. Compared to other interventions, personal assistance may have unique benefits and potential drawbacks. Assistants may help children achieve more, but having a personal assistant could be stigmatising. Parents of children with impairments might be relieved to have assistants help care for their children, but assistants might interfere with family life and with users’ need for privacy, or with parents’ own needs to see themselves as adequate carers for their children. Compared to other ways of compensating for particular activity limitations, personal assistance may create unnecessary dependencies for some people. Even if personal assistance is clearly preferred over other services by working adults with physical impairments, groups that are underrepresented in the public discourse about the rights of people with impairments (e.g., children, people with intellectual impairments, and people in rural areas) may prefer other services, particularly since these groups may be more susceptible to abuse and less able to manage employees. Direct payments for personal assistance may not be ideal for children and families who have difficulty finding an assistant, administering services, negotiating or giving instructions (Pijl 2000). While many personal assistants are managed by users or their representatives, the nature of personal assistance can make it difficult to separate the roles that individuals play in supporting people with impairments. For example, Askheim identified one mother of a child with intellectual impairments in Norway who acted both as the manager of her child's payments and as a full-time personal assistant (Askheim 2003). Policies that permit different care arrangements may have substantially different impacts. As the personal assistance movement gained strength, Ratzka noted that ‘there has been surprisingly little in the way of policy evaluation. The work that has been done in this area is restricted to gathering descriptive statistics on number of hours provided by one type of service, number of consumers, staff, and expenditures’ (Ratzka 1986). Some research now suggests that personal assistance may meet otherwise unmet needs of people with impairments. Shortly after its introduction, a survey of direct payment recipients in the UK found that 40% had a need for additional hours of personal service while 80% of people receiving other services had a similar need (Zarb 1994). However, traditional reviews have failed to locate many evaluation studies and have not offered a definitive account of international research on personal assistance. A recent report by the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare (Socialstyrelsen) highlighted the need for a sensitive and exhaustive search for trials and a systematic synthesis of existing studies (Socialstyrelsen 2005). To assess the effectiveness of personal assistance for children and adolescents (0-18) with both physical and intellectual impairments, and the impacts of personal assistance on families and carers, compared to other interventions. Randomised controlled trials, quasi-randomised controlled trials and nonrandomised controlled studies of personal assistance compared to other forms of support or to ‘no-intervention’ (which may include unpaid care) in which participants were prospectively assigned to study groups and in which control group outcomes were measured concurrently with intervention group outcomes. Children and adolescents (0-18) living in the community who require assistance to perform tasks of daily living (bathing, eating, getting around, etc.) and participate in normal activities due to permanent physical and intellectual impairments. With the exception of young people living in student accommodation (e.g. residential schools), young people living outside their own homes (e.g., in private or public institutions for people with impairments) will be excluded. Children and adolescents with physical impairments only and intellectual impairments only will be excluded because these impairments affect activities and participation differently. Personal assistance is paid individualised human support that is designed to promote participation of people with permanent impairments. In consultation with experts and the reference group, the reviewers sought to determine what minimal amount of assistance would could be offered and still follow the personal assistance model for this population. For inclusion in this review, personal assistance must have been delivered for at least 20 hours per week. Comparisons might include, either singly or in combination, family care, institutionalisation, on-demand services, escort services, and other alternatives to personal assistance. ‘No-treatment’ and ‘waiting list’ groups will be included even if other services received are no described. These will be treated as separate comparisons. Studies examining different forms of personal assistance (e.g., assistance organised by users compared to assistance organised by others) will be included in the review, though these comparisons will be discussed separately as the outcomes from such studies would not indicate the effectiveness of personal assistance relative to other interventions. Primary outcomes will include: 1) Global quality of life, both (a) generic measures (e.g., the Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory; Varni 2005) and (b) specific measures designed for people with particular impairments. Though well-validated measures for the general population will be considered, a review of global health measures found that ‘very few measures have been validated specifically for cognitively impaired respondents’ (Riemsma 2001) or for people with both physical and intellectual impairments. 2) User satisfaction. Direct reports will be preferred, though proxies might be used if users are unable to communicate. 3) Participation, including social activities, ability to participate in spontaneous activities, time outside the home, and mobility. Secondary outcomes will include: 1) Unmet needs, particularly the inability to perform activities of daily living. 2) Developmental outcomes, including cognitive milestones, acquisition of skills, and school attendance. 3) Health outcomes, including direct measures of muscle strength, disease, injuries, abuse or pain and indirect measures such as nutrition, emergency room visits or need for hospitalisation or institutionalisation. 4) Psychiatric outcomes, including self-harm, pica (eating non-food substances), and outwardly directed challenging behaviour. Measures might include items from the externalising scale of the Behavior Problem Inventory (Sturmey 1993). 5) Impact on others, including parental (maternal) employment, satisfaction, and quality of family life. For example, measures might include the Short-Form Health Survey (SF-36; (Ware 1992) or General Health Questionnaire (GHQ; (Counsell 1994). 6) Direct and indirect costs, both immediate and long-term. To account for normal development and the changing impacts of impairments, outcomes will be grouped by length of follow-up (e.g., 1-3 years, 4-6 years, 6+ years). The organisation of services is often a complicated task and new users or their representatives must train personal assistants. Outcomes measured during the first year of receiving personal assistance will be considered apart from outcomes measured after one or more years to account for this adjustment period, which may not be representative of personal assistance as a whole. As we anticipate many relevant documents will be unpublished, a three-part search strategy will be undertaken in order to maximise chances of capturing all relevant literature. Databases will be searched for published and unpublished studies. All electronic searches will be limited to research reported since 1980 because scoping for this project, including a review of relevant laws and policy documents and contacts with international experts, found that widespread personal assistance programmes began in the mid 1990s. Experts have noted that personal assistance was available in some form before the introduction of programmes in the 1990s, but they and the reviewers believe it is extremely unlikely that any relevant trials were conducted before 1980. No language restrictions will be imposed on any results from any search attempts, although most databases will be searched in English. Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACs) will be searched using Spanish and Portuguese terms and Scandinavian databases will be searched in appropriate languages. No filters based on methodology will be applied because test searches indicated that such filters might eliminate relevant studies. The authors worked with a reference group of users, clinicians, policymakers, and analysts (Jackson 2005) to develop this protocol and search strategy. The group recommended a highly sensitive search (one that will likely to capture all relevant reports) rather than a more specific one (a search that would identify fewer irrelevant papers). The following databases will be searched electronically: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) MEDLINE CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature) EMBASE LILACs (Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature) ASSIA (Applied Social Science Index & Abstracts) BIDS (International Bibliography of the Social Sciences [IBSS] on Bath Information and Data Services [BIDS]) C2-SPECTR (The Campbell Collaboration's Social, Psychological, Educational and Criminological Trials Register) Dissertations Abstracts A (Dissertation Abstracts International A: The Humanities and Social Sciences) EconLit ERIC (Educational Resources Information Center) PsycINFO Sociological Abstracts SIGLE search (System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe) Artikelsök DIVA Handicat Hicat LIBRIS LIBRIS Uppsök SveMed+ Danbib Medline will be searched using the following terms: 1 Home Care Services/ 2 Activities of Daily Living/ 3 Personal Health Services/ 4 (personal adj2 assist$).mp.

These approaches and any replies will be documented by the authors. Additionally, impairment-oriented email lists (list-servs) will be sent a letter requesting assistance in locating studies. The reviewers will contact authors of all included and excluded studies to request details of ongoing and unpublished studies. Reference lists from previous reviews and from all included and excluded studies will be searched. Relevant websites, including those maintained by users, governments, other agencies, and academics will be searched. From the resultant list of articles, outcome evaluations about people with impairments will be identified through electronic and hand searches. Two authors (EMW and PM) will check titles for relevance. When a title appears potentially relevant, both authors will examine the abstract. If one author feels an abstract might be relevant, the full article will be obtained. Two authors will examine the remaining papers to determine eligibility. Study authors will be contacted if further information could resolve initial disagreements about inclusion. Remaining disagreements will be discussed with the third reviewer (JD). If a consensus cannot be reached, the Coordinating Editor of the CDPLPG will be consulted. A flowchart of the process of trial selection will be made in accordance with the QUORUM statement (Moher 1999). Data extraction will be conducted independently by two authors (EMW and PM) using a specially developed data extraction form. When more than two treatment arms are included in the same trial, all arms will be described. The following data will be collected for all trial arms: 1) Descriptive data, including participant demographics (age, gender, types and extent of impairments, social and economic status); 2) Intervention characteristics (including delivery, duration, and within-intervention variability); 3) Other interventions received; 4) Outcome measures listed above. The following data will be collected for all studies: 1) Programme differentiation (Dane 1998; MRC 2000), including crossover between groups and the differences between the interventions received; and 2) Context. Two reviewers (EMW and PM) will independently assign each included study to a quality category described in the Cochrane Handbook (Higgins 2005) where: (A) indicates adequate concealment of the allocation (for example, by telephone randomisation, or use of consecutively numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes); (B) indicates uncertainty about whether the allocation was adequately concealed (for example, where the method of concealment is not known); (C) indicates that the allocation was definitely not adequately concealed (for example, open random number lists or quasi-randomisation such as alternate days, odd/even date of birth, or hospital number) (D) random allocation not used. Studies in all quality categories will be considered for inclusion in the review and meta-analyses. Though well-designed nonrandomised studies sometimes come to the same conclusions as randomised trials, nonrandomised studies are most likely to arrive at different conclusions about an intervention's effects when groups are different at the outset (Deeks 2003). Therefore, the pre-treatment assessment and the allocation of participants will be described in the description of studies to identify differences between intervention and control groups that may have existed at baseline. Existing scales for measuring the quality of controlled trials have not been properly developed, are not well-validated and are known to give differing (even opposing) ratings of trial quality in systematic reviews (Moher 1995). At present, evidence indicates that ‘scales should generally not be used to identify trials of apparent low quality or high quality in a given systematic review. Rather, the relevant methodological aspects should be identified a priori and assessed individually’ (Juni 2001). The following components will be considered in the description of studies: 1) Allocation bias (Was group assignment determined randomly or might it have been related to outcomes or the interventions received?); 2) Performance bias (Could the services provided have been influenced by something other than the interventions being compared?); 3) Detection bias (Were outcomes influenced by anything other than the constructs of interest, including biased assessment or the influence of exposure on detection?); 4) Report bias (Were the outcomes, measures and analyses selected a priori and reported completely? Were participants biased in their recall or response?); 5) Attrition bias (Could deviations from protocol, including missing data and dropout, have influenced the results?) (Delgado 2004; Juni 2001); and 6) Outcome validity (Were the outcome measures objective, validated for the population, reported directly by the user or obtained through official records, etc.?). All eligible outcome measures for all trial arms will be reported in the review. If two or more eligible intervention groups are compared to an eligible control, thus requiring that the reviewers choose a single intervention group for comparison",

      "title": "A rare yet treatable case of paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia",
      "abstract": "Dear Sir, Paroxysmal dyskinesias are movement disorders that manifest with recurrent abnormal involuntary movements that are episodic. The movements can be chorea, athetosis, ballism, dystonia, or a combination of all.[1] Paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia (PKD) is the most common type of movement disorder, and it can be primary or secondary to some illnesses and is precipitated by sudden voluntary actions.[2] The secondary causes implicated are trauma; stroke; neurosyphilis; encephalitis; multiple sclerosis; and metabolic abnormalities such as diabetes, hypoparathyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, and kernicterus.[3] Here, we describe a case of secondary PKD. A 32-year-old man with normal birth and developmental milestones presented with multiple episodes of dystonic posturing in the left upper and lower limbs precipitated by walking or activity for 10 years. The frequency of the episodes was 4–5 per day. There was no preceding aura, sensory disturbance, loss of consciousness, tongue bite, or urinary incontinence in any of the episodes. In addition, the patient denied any premonitory urge before the attacks, and they were not suppressible. Each episode lasted 25–40 seconds and used to occur soon after patient started walking and would subside spontaneously. There was no history of gait imbalance, cognitive impairment, or cranial nerve involvement. His family history was negative for similar complaints. He was treated with multiple antiseizure medications in the past with no relief in symptoms. On examination, the mini-mental state examination score was 30/30. His general physical examination was normal. His speech, cranial nerves, power, reflexes, and sensory and cerebellar examination were normal, and he was noted to have positive Trousseau sign. He underwent video electroencephalography recording with the possibility of seizures versus movement disorder. No epileptiform discharges were detected in both ictal and interictal electroencephalography. Routine investigations, including hemogram and renal and liver function tests, were within normal limits. The corrected serum calcium level was 5.1 mg/dL (8.6–10.2 mg/dL) and phosphorus level was 5.3 mg/dL (2.5–4.5 mg/dL). Serum ionized calcium measured during the dystonic attack was 0.8 mmol/L (1.16–1.3 mmol/L). Serum ceruloplasmin, peripheral blood film for acanthocytes, and thyroid function were within normal limits. Electrocardiogram revealed prolonged QTc interval. Non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) head revealed calcifications in the bilateral caudate, putamen, thalami [Figure 1], and cerebellum. Subsequently, the intact parathyroid hormone level was 1.56 pg/mL (normal, 15–65 pg/mL) and vitamin D level was 40 ng/mL (11–42 ng/mL). He was managed with acetazolamide and high-dose calcium supplementation, following which the attacks remarkably diminished in duration and frequency at his 1-month follow up.Figure 1:: Non-contrast computed tomography head showing calcification of the bilateral basal ganglia structures and thalamiThis case is noteworthy as it remained a diagnostic dilemma for approximately 10 years. Simple investigations such as serum calcium and NCCT head clinched the diagnosis. A multitude of clinical features are reported in hypoparathyroidism such as seizures, tetany, depression, psychosis, and extrapyramidal manifestations.[4,5] However, case reports of hypoparathyroidism presenting as PKD are scarce.[6-9] The involuntary movements are due to low serum calcium levels; hypocalcemia renders the neuronal membrane hyperexcitable and leads to paroxysmal dyskinesia, but why the symptoms are paroxysmal is enigmatic. The symptoms usually respond to high-dose calcium supplementation. In addition, the dystonic movements can occur in the setting of normal serum calcium levels when there are extensive calcium deposits in the basal ganglia. Perfusion abnormalities have been noted in the basal ganglia of patients with PKD. The cause of hypoparathyroidism in this patient is highly likely to be idiopathic; we did not perform any genetic testing due to financial constraints. In conclusion, we report an uncommon but easily treatable secondary cause of PKD. Investigations such as serum calcium and NCCT head helped in the diagnosis, and the patient responded well to treatment.

      "abstract": "Introduction We know the coexistence of traumatic factors (loss of affective relationships, experiences of abuse, extreme risk situations, etc.) is common in psychiatric pathologies in which level of stress experienced exceeds normal capacity of the person, favoring the appearance of dissociative or excision mechanisms. A common mistake is to pathologize them and try to eliminate them. Objectives The objective of this paper is to study trauma and defense mechanisms involved, in order to carry out a better approach. Methods A bibliographic search was performed from different database (Pubmed, TripDatabase) about trauma, mechanisms involved and the construction of identity. Results We know neural pathways mature asymmetrically in evolutionary development (functions related to attention, concentration and executive function having special importance) and thus, traumas occurred in moments of greatest vulnerability such as early childhood, can damage and interfere with the correct integration of neural processes, producing disproportionate and unnecessarily maintained alert responses (common basis for many pathologies such as borderline personality disorder or traumatic psychosis). In response to this, reactive mechanisms are produced (such as dissociation or cleavage) that are not necessarily pathological and therefore, we should not always intervene by eliminating them because they often function as a protective factor, allowing to preserve functioning and favoring recovery. Conclusions In conclusion, we need a better understanding of mechanisms involved in trauma, executive function and the alarm system beyond anxiety reactions, trying to understand the function of symptom without eliminating it, but evaluating whether there are healthier alternatives can be promoted for the complete recovery of the patient.

      "title": "Developmental coordination disorder continues to evolve",
      "abstract": "Motor coordination has classically been understood in terms of harnessing degrees of freedom and performance variables in the neuro-musculo-skeletal system. In clinical examination, however, coordination is often seen as resulting from a selective contribution to sensorimotor processing by proprioceptive, vestibular input and cerebellar modulation. Therefore, impaired coordination (often described as ataxia) typically rules out other causes such as muscle weakness, abnormal muscle tone, disrupted motor planning, or the occurrence of involuntary movements. This is both a great strength and a difficulty in clinical neurology: many descriptors are based on phenomenological observation, but also have a localizing connotation. For example, dystonia is not any one type of muscle tone impairment, as implied by etymology, but reflects basal ganglia dysfunction. It is distinct from spasticity, which indicates abnormal corticospinal tract function.1 Similarly, aphasia (literally absence of speech) does not overlap with anarthria (absence of articulated speech) but refers to language difficulties that can be traced to other brain regions. Yet, the clinico-anatomical approach is less accurate or is inappropriate when clinical signs relate to brain development.2 In this context, replacing the privative prefix ‘a’ by ‘dys’ sometimes serves to denote the developmental character and signal differences in presentation, clinico-anatomical correlation, outcome, and management needs, as in (developmental) ‘dysphasia’ versus (acquired) ‘aphasia’, or ‘dyspraxia’ versus ‘apraxia’. Growing interest in neurodevelopmental conditions has led many clinicians and researchers to move beyond these semantic considerations. They have adopted a more pragmatic approach to define more useful frameworks for understanding the complexity at stake and assessing intervention approaches. The developmental coordination disorder (DCD) construct has thus emerged to describe a comprehensive developmental condition in which impairments in a child's capacity to develop and execute coordinated motor skills cannot be explained by cognitive or sensory dysfunction or other neurological conditions. In DCD, the hallmark ‘coordination disorder’ is inclusive and not specifically clinico-anatomically localizing. The construct has superseded the restrictive characterization of dyspraxia. Therefore, dyspraxia could potentially be used to address an overlooked aspect of the complex motor phenotype in other defined neurodevelopmental disorders, whether generic (e.g. autism spectrum disorder or cerebral palsy) or specific (e.g. neurogenetic syndromes), which has not been common practice. In many clinical situations, DCD has also proved more relevant than previous concepts based on supposed minimal brain lesions or dysfunction. In 2012, Developmental Medicine & Child Neurology (DMCN) published the outcome of a several-year-long effort by the European Academy of Childhood Disability (EACD) to provide recommendations for the diagnosis, assessment, and management of DCD. These recommendations were based on sound appraisal of the body of studies available then and endeavoured to translate results into good clinical practice. The recommendations have been very influential in clinical practice worldwide. They have also further shaped and clarified the DCD concept for the provision of service and for clinical research. A wealth of new studies published since then have brought valuable insights into motor performance, executive functions, cognition, visual functioning, mental health, other aspects of ‘comorbidity’, quality of life, assessment, as well as clues to pathophysiology and the potential for improving outcomes.3, 4 The way we approach DCD has also changed. To cite but one example relating to nosology, the fifth and latest revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) now lists DCD as a main disorder under a new ‘Neurodevelopmental Disorders’ cluster. In this issue of DMCN, we present the fully updated EACD recommendations,5 which marks an important, historic step in the understanding and treatment of DCD. We expect these recommendations to improve identification, evaluation, and management of this condition. Hopefully, they will continue to enhance the current practical relevance of the DCD construct and contribute to our evolving understanding of DCD in the wider context of developmental disorders.",

Like these types of epilepsy, MAE is polygenically determined with little non-genetic variability. The disease is characterized by the following criteria: genetic predisposition (high incidence of seizures and/or genetic EEG patterns in relatives); mostly normal development and no neurological deficits before onset; primarily generalized myoclonic, astatic or myoclonic-astatic seizures, short absences and mostly generalized tonic-clonic seizures; no tonic seizures or tonic drop attacks during daytime (except for some rare cases with a most unfavourable course); generalized EEG patterns (spikes and waves, photosensitivity, 4-7/sec rhythms), no multifocal EEG abnormalities (but often pseudofoci). There is a partial overlap with other 'syndromes', such as benign and severe myoclonic epilepsy in infants (Dravet et al., 1985a, b), myoclonic epilepsy of infancy and early childhood (Aicardi and others). In differential diagnosis the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in its stricter sense has to be considered, and also atypical benign partial epilepsy or pseudo-Lennox syndrome. Discussion is presented of possible pitfalls in the classical syndromic approach to classifying epilepsies of early childhood, and of the advantages of a neurobiological view for understanding the immense variability of clinical manifestations of epilepsy.",

      "title": "Can leukocyte telomere shortening be a possible biomarker to track Huntington’s disease progression?",
      "abstract": "Huntington's disease (HD): HD is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease, caused by a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the first exon of the HTT gene encoding the huntingtin protein. The mutant protein contains an expanded polyglutamine sequence that confers a toxic gain-of-function and causes neurodegeneration. Moreover, several studies indicate that loss of the normal protein beneficial functions, contribute to the pathology (Schulte and Littleton 2011). Triplet expansion over 40 repeats are fully penetrant and invariably lead to manifest HD in the fourth or fifth decade of life. Clinically, HD is a debilitating, incurable disorder in which no symptoms reveal genetic status (presymptomatic phase) until signs and symptoms of motor impairment, such as poor coordination or slight involuntary movements and subtle changes in eye movements, begin to appear (prodromal phase). Often the prodromal phase (up to 15 years before the full-blown disorders) includes psychological and psychiatric alterations as irritable mood, depression, difficulty in learning new information or mental planning; nonetheless, affected individuals are usually able to perform their ordinary activities and to continue work. With progression of the disease, however, involuntary jerking or twitching movements (choreic movement) become exacerbated, making walking, speaking, and swallowing increasingly difficult. Also, cognitive and psychiatric symptoms are worsening until dementia (Paulsen, 2010). The clinical diagnosis of HD is based chiefly on the presence of motor signs and symptoms according to the diagnostic confidence level from the Unified Huntington's Disease rating scale. This standard assessment tool for grading HD symptom severity is based on two relevant subscores: total functional capacity, which tracks the ability to perform daily activities, and the total motor score, which specifically tracks motor abilities (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1305/). The diagnostic confidence level ranges from 0 (asymptomatic) to 4 (motor impairments as unambiguous signs of HD). When a clinical diagnosis is established, the disease is manifest and becomes more and more devastating with time. In late stages, motor disability progress from hyperkinesia/chorea to severe hypokinesia/rigidity, rendering the affected individual often totally dependent, mute, and incontinent. Since, right now, there are no disease-modifying treatments, the disease slowly progresses toward death within 15 to 18 years after its onset. Though no treatment can alter its course, the prodromal stage is fundamental for evaluating the wide spectrum of signs and symptoms of disease progression. In addition, earlier stages of dysfunction offer a potential window for intervention or modification of pathogenic mechanisms. The duration of these stages varies among individuals. The length of CAG repeat is negatively correlated with age at disease onset. Models based on biological age and CAG repeat length are available to approximately estimate the years until onset in mutation carriers (Langbehn et al., 2010). Such testing, although useful, is not accurate in predicting age at clinical onset because CAG length accounts for only about 50–70% of the variation within a range of 40 to 55 CAG repeats. The residual variance is probably due to genetic, stochastic, and environmental factors. Given this variance, there is growing interest in HD research to search for phenotype modifier genes and biomarkers, identify specific changes or \"stages\" of disease progression, predict disease onset, and accurately track disease progression in premanifest HD (Gusella et al., 2014). Telomeres as HD biomarkers: The possibility of presymptomatic genetic testing in HD opens the way for evaluating potential disease-modifying treatments in the premanifest phase. Biomarkers that reflect underlying disease processes or progression are needed to monitor changes in clinically asymptomatic individuals. No studies to date have yielded validated biomarkers that can accurately predict either age at HD onset or disease progression, although the neurofilament light protein appears extremely promising (Silajdzic and Bjorkqvist, 2018). At present there are no effective treatments in clinical practice that can prevent the disease, halt its progression or delay its onset. Nonetheless, as the future holds promise for disease-modifying strategies, there is a need for reliably assessable disease progression biomarkers, as well as markers to detect treatment-related changes. Ideally, a biomarker will be closely linked to the pathophysiology of the disease, reliable, accurate, sensitive, specific, reproducible, inexpensive, non-invasive, and acceptable for the patient (Silajdzic and Bjorkqvist, 2018). Easily accessible peripheral biomarkers from peripheral blood mononuclear cells and plasma have gained increasing attention. Our recent work seems to indicate that leukocyte telomere length (LTL) could possess several of the characteristics required of an ideal biomarker to track HD progression (Scarabino et al., 2019). Telomeres are the terminal ends of the chromosomes and play a role in preserving genome stability. Telomere shortening occurs progressively with repeated cell division because of the inability of DNA polymerase to replicate the 3′ end of the DNA strand. A cellular multiprotein complex, called telomerase, counteracts telomere shortening, but its activity, usually present in the early stages of embryonic development, is silenced in several human somatic tissues immediately after birth. As a consequence, the telomeres shorten progressively with increasing age in the replicating cells of adult tissues (Blackburn et al., 2015). This phenomenon may indicate cellular senescence and reflect an organism's biological age. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells provide an easily accessible source of cells in which telomere length can be analyzed. Shortened LTL has been found to be associated with aging and various age-related diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, Alzheimer's disease (AD), and stroke-associated dementia. Studies have demonstrated rapid leukocyte telomere shortening in diseases associated with increased systemic oxidative stress and chronic inflammation (von Zglinicki, 2002). In addition, telomere loss may be induced by increased immune cell turnover associated with inflammation. When LTL was investigated in neurodegenerative diseases, shorter LTL was frequently found in association with cognitive decline/dementia and AD. A significant progressive leukocyte telomere reduction detected in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD, as compared with controls (Scarabino et al., 2017), suggests that LTL measurement could be a useful means to follow dementia progression as it converts from prodromal (MCI) to manifest AD. AD and HD share several common features, including loss of neurons, accumulation of aggregated and misfolded proteins, and cognitive decline (Clark and Kodadek, 2016). Unlike subjects with MCI in which the evolution of the disease towards AD is uncertain, premanifest individuals with HD will inexorably develop the disease, although the age at disease onset varies widely. Our recent study (Scarabino et al., 2019) analyzed LTL in a sample of patients with premanifest (pre-HD, n = 38), manifest HD (HD, n = 62), and healthy control (n = 76) to gain a clearer picture of the relationship between telomere length and HD progression. The mean LTL differed significantly (P < 0.00001) across the three groups, with the highest mean values observed in the control group, intermediate values in the premanifest HD, and the lowest values in the manifest HD patients (Figure 1A), suggesting a relationship between telomere shortening and manifest HD development. The mean LTL values observed in manifest HD were nearly half those observed in the age-matched controls and slightly higher than the minimum length reported to be necessary to ensure human telomere protective stability in white blood cells (Blackburn et al., 2015). Comparison of the regression lines showed that the decreasing trends for telomere length with age were significantly different among the three groups (Figure 1B). As expected, there was a downward trend of LTL with increasing age in the controls, which began to increase with advancing ages. In very young premanifest HD patients, LTL was very similar to that reported for the age-matched controls but with and fast decrease after the age of 30. The youngest manifest HD subjects showed already very short telomeres, with only a slight decrease in the most advanced ages (Figure 1B).Figure 1: Distribution of LTL in HD patients.(A) Box Plot showing the distribution of LTL (T/S ratio) in controls, premanifest HD (Pre-HD), and manifest HD patients (HD). LTL was measured by real-time PCR. T/S ratio: Number of copies of telomeric repeats (T) as compared to single copy gene (S). (B) LTL expressed as T/S ratio as a function of age in controls, in premanifest HD (pre-HD) and manifest HD patients (HD) (Scarabino et al., 2019). LTL: Leukocyte telomere length; HD: Huntington's disease.After adjusting LTL for age, the effect of CAG repeat number on LTL was analyzed as well. An inverse relationship between mean LTL values and number of CAG repeats was found in the individuals with premanifest HD but not in those with manifest HD, indicating that in premanifest HD the number of CAG repeats contributes to telomere attrition independently of age (Scarabino et al., 2019). These findings indicate that in premanifest HD leukocyte telomeres begin to shorten gradually and markedly after age 30 years, depending on increasing age and CAG number, up to the values that are typically observed in patients with manifest HD. In premanifest HD individuals, LTL was then examined in relation to the estimated time to clinical diagnosis. The estimated age at onset was calculated according to the formula of Lanbehn et al. (2010), at different probability values, given CAG repeat number and age at blood sampling. The years to clinical diagnosis were calculated as the difference between estimated onset and age at blood sampling. A significant linear positive relationship was observed between LTL and estimated years to diagnosis, indicating that the fewer the estimated years to HD onset, the shorter the LTL and vice-versa (Scarabino et al., 2019). To date, two other studies on LTL in HD have confirmed significantly shorter LTL in HD patients as compared with controls (Kota et al., 2015; Castaldo et al., 2019). Taken together, the data seem to indicate that LTL could possess several characteristics required of an ideal biomarker of HD progression (Silajdzic and Bjorkqvist, 2018). It can be easily obtained by inexpensive blood sampling, and it is readily quantifiable and highly reproducible. Moreover, LTL is closely linked to the pathophysiology of HD. Indeed, the discovery of brain lymphatic vessels, the new role of microglia and astrocytes in survival, and metabolism of neurons are changing the idea of the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. There is now strong evidence that the mechanism leading to neuron death is substantially influenced by the expression of the mutant protein by non-neuronal cells (microglia-astrocytes, non-cell autonomous pathogenesis). Since microglial cells are regulated and regulate lymphocytes (Clark and Kodadek, 2016), we reason that peripheral lymphocyte stress might be a faithful mirror of microglia-astrocytes-neuron stress. Moreover, also leukocyte telomere shortening could reflect microglial activation and the resulting neuroinflammatory state. In this context, we may speculate that leukocyte telomere shortening could be an indicator of the above-mentioned phenomena that accompany disease progression from the premanifest to manifest HD. Conclusions and future perspectives: LTL measurement seems to possess distinctive features required for a suitable biomarker to detect HD progression: it is easy to obtain, readily quantifiable and reproducible, and closely linked to the pathophysiology of HD. In premanifest HD individuals, LTL shows a very significant linear relationship with the estimated years to the clinical onset of HD and could predict the time at clinical diagnosis with good probability levels. Using LTL as a biomarker in HD could have multiple potential applications: characterize the different phases (premanifest and overt dis ease); monitor the progression of pathogenic events leading to manifest disease; find peripheral patterns that may mirror brain dysfunctions; contribute to constructing a simple and reliable model, perhaps by incorporating novel biomarkers (LTL, circulating micro-RNAs and sno-RNAs, neurofilament light protein), to predict disease onset and to define a temporal window in which patients could be effectively treated. Previous models, which focused only on the length of CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion, were univariate predictors of clinical age; monitoring the efficacy of potential novel therapies. In this context, a non-invasive procedure to obtain samples and relatively simple analytical assays are desirable as biomarkers for trials and care in premanifest HD individuals. Extending the analysis to a larger sample with a longitudinal study design would be useful for investigating the real properties of LTL as a biomarker for HD progression. We thank R.M.

      "abstract": "Masturbation, or self-stimulation of the genitalia is a common human behavior, said to occur in 90–94% of males and 50–60% of females at some time in their lives [1]. Infantile masturbation is highlighted because masturbatory behavior has been often mistaken for epilepsy due to usual presentation with paroxysmal movements of recurrent character [2]. Infantile masturbation can also mimic other conditions such as abdominal pain, paroxysmal dystonia and dyskinesia [3, 4]. Masturbatory activity in infant and young children is difficult to recognize because it has a spectrum of different behavior patterns, which often do not involve manual stimulation of the genitalia. Misdiagnosis consequently may lead to unnecessary investigations and treatment [2,3]. The condition is more often seen in girls than in boys (65% among 31 patients in Nechay at al. [5], all 12 patients were girls in Yang et al. [4]). It often starts at age under 1 year of life. Episodes are usually observed when the child is sitting in a car seat, when he/she is bored or tired and in relation to the transition between waking and sleeping [5]. During the events of masturbation children exhibit different types of behavior: dystonia-like posturing of different parts of the body has been most often seen, grunting, flushing and sweating are also very typical; rocking and assumed eidetic imagery (seeing ‘telly in the sky’) can also be observed",

      "abstract": "Spasticity, a classical clinical manifestation of an upper motor neuron lesion, has been traditionally and physiologically defined as a velocity dependent increase in muscle tone caused by the increased excitability of the muscle stretch reflex. Clinically spasticity manifests as an increased resistance offered by muscles to passive stretching (lengthening) and is often associated with other commonly observed phenomenon like clasp-knife phenomenon, increased tendon reflexes, clonus and flexor and extensor spasms. The key to the increased excitability of the muscle stretch reflex (muscle tone) is the abnormal activity of muscle spindles which have an intricate relation with the innervations of the extrafusal muscle fibers at the spinal level (feed-back and feed-forward circuits) which are under influence of the supraspinal pathways (inhibitory and facilitatory). The reflex hyperexcitability develops over variable period of time following the primary lesion (brain or spinal cord) and involves adaptation in spinal neuronal circuitries caudal to the lesion. It is highly likely that in humans, reduction of spinal inhibitory mechanisms (in particular that of disynaptic reciprocal inhibition) is involved. While simply speaking the increased muscle stretch reflex may be assumed to be due to an altered balance between the innervations of intra and extrafusal fibers in a muscle caused by loss of inhibitory supraspinal control, the delayed onset after lesion and the frequent reduction in reflex excitability over time, suggest plastic changes in the central nervous system following brain or spinal lesion. It seems highly likely that multiple mechanisms are operative in causation of human spasticity, many of which still remain to be fully elucidated.",

      "title": "A preliminary description of the occurrence of proto-injurious behavior in typically developing children.",
      "abstract": "Abstract Self-injurious (SIB) is a disorder typically associated with developmental disabilities. However, throughout early childhood, some typically developing children also display that is topographically similar to SIB but does not cause injury, commonly referred to as behavior (PIB). To date, little research has examined the occurrence of these behaviors in typically developing children. In the current paper, we present preliminary data from a sample of typically developing children in the southeastern United States for whom caregivers reported the occurrence of PIB. The results are discussed in comparison to the occurrence of these behaviors in other populations and in terms of implications for understanding the developmental course of SIB. Keywords: childhood development, descriptive questionnaire, proto-injurious behavior, self-injurious ********** Self-injurious (SIB) has been defined as an act in which an individual produces physical damage to his or her own body (Tate & Baroff, 1966). Examples of frequently observed SIB among individuals with developmental disabilities include head banging, self-hitting, self-pinching, self-scratching, pica, hand mouthing, eye poking, and hair pulling (Iwata et al., 1994; Johnson & Day, 1992). The occurrence of chronic SIB can lead to physical sequelae including hematomas, severe tissue damage, and in some cases, death. General prevalence estimates of SIB among individuals with developmental disabilities are 10 to 20% (Oliver, Murphy, & Corbett, 1987; Schroeder, Schroeder, Smith, & Dalldorf, 1978). SIB, which is interpreted as abnormal and disruptive among individuals with developmental disabilities, may also occur in developmentally typical children. However, such is rarely interpreted as abnormal or disruptive in non-disabled children primarily because it rarely produces longterm tissue damage (Hyman, Fisher, Mercugliano, & Cataldo, 1990). In many cases, such is viewed as developmentally normal (Lourie, 1949; Thelen, 1979). Although the form of the topographically resembles SIB (e.g., contact of the head to a hard surface), the often does not resemble SIB along other dimensions (e.g., intensity, frequency), and usually requires no direct intervention. Thus, of this type may be considered non-clinical forms of SIB. However, it is possible that some of these forms have the potential to develop into clinically significant problems; thus, this class of is often referred to as behavior (PIB; Berkson & Tusa, 2002). In general, the extant literature has focused primarily on the occurrence of proto-injurious head banging in young children of typical development. For example, using questionnaires mailed to the mothers of full-term, developmentally typical infants, De Lissovoy (1961) noted the occurrence of head banging in 15.2% of 487 children. Sallustro and Atwell (1978) administered questionnaires to the parents of 525 children (aged 3 to 72 months) and noted head banging to occur in 5.1% of their sample. Similarly, Kravitz and colleagues reported the occurrence of head banging in 3.6% of a sample of 135 typically developing children (Kravitz, Rosenthal, Teplitz, Murphy, & Lesser, 1960) and in 7% of the sample of infants less than 12 months old (Kravitz & Boehm, 1971). Thus, in the research discussed above, the occurrence of head banging ranged from 3.6% to 15.2% of typically developing children. However, less is known about the occurrence of other topographies of PIB (e.g., self-hitting) among typically developing children. A possible exception is research conducted by Troster, Brambring, and Beelmann (1991) who presented data on the occurrence of PIB and repetitive movements in children with visual impairments. In surveys of 85 caregivers of visually impaired children ranging in age from 10 to 82 months, Troster et al. …",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Obsessive-compulsive disorder is a chronic and highly prevalent neuropsychiatric disorder, with treatment lacking efficacy in a significant proportion of cases. Thus, a more comprehensive understanding of the brain mechanisms underlying OCD is needed. Dysfunction in corticostriatal circuits, which underlie learning of new actions, has been suggested by several studies. However, there is no consensus about how such dysfunction may generate obsessive-compulsive symptoms, nor about the therapeutic potential of invasive or non-invasive neuromodulation techniques targeting the brain areas that are involved.Objectives: To review neuroimaging and behavioral findings related to learning of actions in OCD, and its potential therapeutic relevance.Methods: Non-systematic literature review, using the keywords “obsessive-compulsive disorder”, “neuroimaging”, “corticostriatothalamic dysfunction model”, “instrumental learning”, “reinforcement learning”, “deep brain stimulation” e “transcranial magnetic stimulation”.Results: In reinforcement learning tasks, OCD patients have a deficit in goal-directed or model-based learning, with a tendency towards habitual behavior or model-free learning. On the other hand, the most consistent neuroimaging findings in OCD are low volume and hyperactivity of the orbitofrontal cortex, as well as caudate hyperactivity – and both of these areas are important for reinforcement learning. In fact, rodent studies have demonstrated that the OFC, in particular the lateral OFC, plays an important role in the shift between habitual and goal-directed behavior, suggesting that this may be an important mechanism underlying OCD.Conclusions: Notwithstanding all of the progress in this area, new reinforcement learning tasks are needed for improved understanding of the role of the OFC in OCD, and to explore the behavioral, and potentially also therapeutic effects of neuromodulation of this brain area.",

The tendon reflexes have a lowered threshold to tap, the response of the tapped muscle is increased, and usually muscles besides the tapped one respond; tonic stretch reflexes are affected in the same way.(5)A motor disorder characterized by a velocity-dependent increase in tonic stretch reflexes (muscle tone) with exaggerated tendon jerks, resulting from hyperexcitability of the stretch reflex, as one component of the upper motoneuron syndrome.(5)A disorder of spinal proprioceptive reflexes, manifested clinically as tendon jerk hyperreflexia and an increase in muscle tone that becomes more apparent the more rapid the stretching movement.(6)As we can see from these definitions, spasticity involves muscles that areextraordinarily prone to contracting, especially when the muscle is trying to be stretched.",

Excessive force to the head, either through direct impact or force transmission through the body and neck, is a concussive event. After a concussive event, there can be injury not only to the brain, but also to other structures such as the cervical spine and vestibular system.

The identified symptom(s) is neither intentionally produced nor directly attributable to another mental disorder. In order to be counted as a somatoform symptom the complaint must be clinically significant in terms of causing distress or impairment in an important area of functioning (DSM-IV-TR). The chapter clearly outlines the nosology of these disorders and the reason for their grouping. Provided is a thorough description of the definition, diagnosis, epidemiology, etiology, pathophysiology, differential diagnosis, course, natural history, prognosis, and treatment for somatization disorder, undifferentiated somatoform disorder, conversion disorder, pain disorder, hypochondriasis, body dysmorphic disorder, and somatoform disorder, not otherwise specified.",

Some of the earliest physical signs—any one of which associated with a particular form of insanity will almost infallibly indicate the first stage of this special disorder—are the intermittent pulse, the irregular or contracted pupil, the quivering lip or embarrassed articulation. The second stage is marked by loss of power in the upper extremities, by a gait more or less unsteady, by diminished sensation in the cutaneous nerves, or by the loss of some of the special senses. In the third period the disease approaches its climax, in an entire want of motory power, and by an impairment of all the nervous functions so universal, that although organic life may, under careful treatment, be prolonged for a considerable time, the patient may be said to exist rather than to live. Epileptiform attacks may precede or accompany any one of these stages. They sometimes very distinctly mark out their boundaries, or the disorder may run its course without any recognised convulsive seizures.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The metabolic and anatomical substrate of most forms of mental retardation is not known. Because the basis of normal brain function is not sufficiently understood, the basis of abnormal function is understood poorly. Even in disorders where the fundamental biochemical defect is known, such as phenylketonuria (PKU) and other enzyme defects, the exact basis for brain dysfunction is uncertain. The outcome for treated PKU, galactosemia, homocystinuria, and lysosomal disorders is not yet optimal. The various forms of nonketotic hyperglycinemia often respond poorly to current therapy. Less familiar disorders, with or without seizures, such as deficient synthesis of serine or creatine and impaired glucose transport into the brain, and disorders with variable malformations, such as Smith‐Lemli‐Opitz (SLO) syndrome and the congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs), may initially be thought to be a nonspecific form of developmental delay. Less familiar disorders, with or without seizures and disorders with variable malformations may initially be thought to be a nonspecific form of developmental delay. Simple tests of urine, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid may lead to a diagnosis, accurate genetic counseling, and better treatment. Metabolic brain imaging (magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)) has also helped to reveal biochemical abnormalities within the brain. © 2003 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

      "title": "Animal well-being. II. Stress and distress.",
      "abstract": "The concepts of stress and distress are integral parts of consideration of animal well-being. Generally, stress refers to a state of threatened homeostasis, but precise clinical definitions, causes, and biological measurements have been controversial and confusing. Numerous factors associated with needs, life in captivity, threatening events, or aversive stimuli may threaten homeostasis. An animal's well-being or quality of life is an individual's internal somatic and mental state that is affected by what it knows or perceives; its feelings and motivational state; the responses to internal or external stimuli or environments; interacting variables; and phylogeny and ontogeny. Threats to homeostasis activate a complex pattern of behavioral changes and responses in the central and autonomic nervous and endocrine systems. Some responses can be considered normal adaptive and coping activities, satisfactorily handling the threats and therefore contributing to well-being. Other responses may be considered abnormal, maladaptive, and affective disorders. A persistent threat may lead to prolonged hyperactivity of the neuroendocrine system, which impairs rather than contributes to well-being. Except for extremes, differentiation between normal and abnormal internal states is frequently unclear. Individual adapting and coping styles may be more important than the stimuli in determining the varied responses. In animals, perception of a stimulus or life event is as important as the actual situation or environment. As caregivers, humans may know that an event or situation is no threat, but the animal usually does not function with the same information base as humans. A principal component in controlling an animal's response to an external event is determining how the animal perceives a situation. Mental and biological well-being is more likely to exist in animals if they are familiar with their environment, including social groups, and if they can predict or anticipate changes in the environment.",

Behaviourally, schizophrenia patients have profound difficulties in regulating approach and avoidance, causing social withdrawal or aggressive behaviour. Evolutionary hypotheses of schizophrenia abound, but none covers all phenotypic aspects of the syndrome(s). Genetic risk for schizophrenia is partly conferred by genes that have undergone positive selection, whereby the reproductive advantage compensating for the reduced fecundity is as yet unknown. Environmental risk factors for schizophrenia comprise poverty, migration, and urbanicity, which has given rise to the hypothesis that individuals with schizophrenia are particularly sensitive to the exposure of strangers. In a more general vein, many signs and symptoms associated with schizophrenia can be interpreted from an evolutionary point of view. They pertain to diverse aspects of social life, including cooperation and trust (paranoia), mating (delusional jealousy, erotomania), and social rank (catatonic stupor, mutism).",

Notably, behavioral sensitization persists for weeks or months after a moderate treatment regimen of repeated psychostimulant administration (2,4). The relative permanence of behavioral sensitization has resulted in frequent use of behavioral sensitization as an animal model of addiction, specifically the enduring changes in behavior that are associated with a diagnosis of psychostimulant addiction, such as the development of craving-mediated drug seeking and paranoia (5, 6).",

For example, trauma is known to precipitate seizures, headache, or focal neurological deficits in previously asymptomatic individuals. Similarly, psychological stress seems to be a factor in the development of some peptic ulcers, anxiety disorders, and other psychiatric states. In addition, trauma and/or stress have been suspected to have links to many other medical disorders. It is perhaps not surprising, therefore, that both physical trauma and psychological stress have been posited to be causal factors in either the onset or exacerbation of multiple sclerosis (MS). Indeed, this notion has been a conspicuous part of the lore of this illness dating back to its earliest clinical descriptions.",

In many neurological disease states associated with subcortical pathology a similar pattern of dementia exists. The neurobehavioural changes of progressive supranuclear palsy thus typify a clinical pattern which may be referred to as subcortical dementia. The subcortical dementias have a striking clinical resemblance to the dementia which occurs after bifrontal lobe disease. However, the subcortical dementias can be clearly distinguished clinically from cortical dementias, other than frontal dementias. We propose as a tentative hypothesis that there may be common pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the subcortical dementias—in particular, disturbances of timing and activation. There are immediate practical implications of this hypothesis: drugs which have an effect on subcortical timing and activating mechanisms may be useful in the treatment of subcortical dementias.",

      "abstract": "Antipsihotici su prva linija farmakoloskog lijecenja psihoticnih poremecaja i drugih bihevioralmh poremecaja, no lijecenje antipsihoticima uzrokuje brojne nuspojave kao sto su ekstrapiramidne nuspojave (EPS), povecanje tjelesne težine, kardiovaskularne nuspojave i dr. EPS ukljucuju akatiziju, distoniju, maligni neurolepticki sindrom, parkinsonizam i tardivnu diskineziju. Tardivna je diskinezija kompleksan hiperkinetski sidnrom koji se sastoji od koreiformnih, atetoidnih ili ritmicnih abnormalnih nevoljnih pokreta. Akatizija se sastoji od motorickog nemira pracena subjektivnim osjecajem unutarnje napetosti i nelagode, prije svega u udovima. Simptomi koji su obicno vidljivi jesu pokreti donjih udova, ljuljanje s noge na nogu, prebacivanje jedne noqe preko druge u sjedecem položaju. Kod teskog oblika akatizije bolesnici mogu koracati naprijed-natrag ili se ne mogu osjecati ugodno ni u jednom položaju kao sto su sjedenje, ležanje ili stajanje dulje od nekoliko minuta. Vrpoljenje ruku također se može vidjeti. Distonije su nevoljni pokreti karakterizirani intermitetnom ili neprekidnom misicnom aktivnoscu. Pokreti variraju od kratkotrajnog poremecaja do zadržavanja abnormalnoga stava tijela. Misicna ukocenost i posturalna distorzija bolne su i neugodne i mogu bolesnike ciniti agitiranima i preplasenim. Misici glave i vrata najcesce su zahvaceni. Ukljucenost laringealnih i faringealnih misica može voditi respiratornom distresu, asfiksiji i gusenju. Tardivna distomja stanje je teže onesposobljenosti, a simptomi su vise neprekidni u usporedbi s akutnim oblikom. Motoricke su prezentacije slicna onima pri akutnoj distomji i razlikuje se samo po trajanju. Simptomi parkinsonizma razvijaju se podmuklo u danima nakon pocetka lijecenja antipsihotikom. Razvoj simptoma ovisi o dozi i pojavljuju se u oko 20 - 40 % bolesnika. Nastavkom lijecenja simptomi parkinsonizma mogu postupno jenjavati i može se razviti tolerancija. Rigidnost udova rezistentna na pasivno pokretanje najocitiji je znak pakrinsonizma inducirana lijekovima. Također se'mogu uociti tremor i bradikinezija. Tardivna diskinezija (TD) jest poremecaj pokreta koji uzrokuje nevoljne, ponavljajuce pokrete tijela i pojavljuje se pri dugotrajnom lijecenju antipsihoticima. Obicno je karakterizirana koreoatetoidnim diskinezijama orofacijalne regije, udova i trupa. Istraživanja provedena u odraslih i starijih osoba pokazala su vecu incidenciju tardivne diskinezije u pacijenata koji su lijeceni konvencionlanim antipsihoticima u odnosu prema onima koji su lijeceni atipicnim antipsihoticima. Maligni neurolepticki sindrom (MNS) rijetka je, ali potencijalno životno ugrožavajuca nuspojava koja se pojavljuje tijekom lijecenja antipsihoticima. Tipicni simptomi i znakovi MNS-a sastoje se od vrucice, misicne ukocenosti, promjena svijesti (konfuznost, agitacija, agresivnost ili katatonija), poremecaja autonomnoga živcanog sustava (hipertenzija, tahikardija, tahipneja, profuzno znojenje, urinarna inkontinencija), abnormalnih vrijednosti laboratorijskih parametara krvi kao sto su niske vrijednosti elektrolita u serumu, povisena vrijednost kreatinin fosfokinaze (CPK) u serumu i leukocitoza. Misicna je rigidnost cesto povezana s mionekrozom, mioglobinurijom i povisenom vrijednosti serumskog CPK-a. EPS smanjuju ucinkovitost lijecenja antipsihoticima uzrokujuci losiju terapijsku suradljivost, stigmu i losiju kvalitetu bolesnikova života.",

This applies also to potential harm from conspecifics, which leads to a choice between escalating and de-escalating strategies. Anxiety is a component of de-escalating strategies mediated by the paleomammalian and reptilian forebrains. When the neomammalian (rational) brain fails to deal with the threat of conspecific danger, these more primitive de-escalating strategies may be activated and may present as anxiety disorders. The capacity for concealment of anxiety and other forms of negative affect has also evolved, and excessive concealment may lead to psychopaihology by breaking the negative feedback loop of excessive motivation, leading to impaired performance, leading to signals of distress, and leading to reduced exhortation to succeed on the part of parents and teachers; this situation is illustrated by a model based on the Yerkes-Dodson law.",

Cauda equina syndrome (CES) affetcs a group of root nerves called Cauda equina\r\n (lat. Pony tail). These nerves are located at the lower end of the spine in the lumbosacral part\r\n of the body. They send and also receive messages for pelvis, legs and feet. Trauma, excessive\r\n strains, violent injuries and some deseases and conditions ( hernation of the disc) can result\r\n with compression of the root of this nerve. There is severe pain in the lower part of the back,\r\n loss or change of sensation in the legs, buttocks and can also result with difficulty in\r\n urinating. Surgical treatment must be performed quickly to prevent permanent damage such\r\n as leg paralysis, bladder and bowel dysfuncion, sexual function or other problems.\r\n This syndrome has a significant effect on people – physically and emotionally, especially if it\r\n is chronic. Often, people with CES may no longer go to work because of the severe problems\r\n with pain, social problems, weaknes in motor and sensor skills that can be fully or partialy\r\n lost. Loss of bladder and bowel control can be extremly disturbing and has a very negative\r\n impact on social life, work and relationships. Nurse interventions should be geared towards\r\n providing supportive, emotional support with education about the syndrome and how to\r\n improve the quality of life, reduce pain; also in interventions they should oberve such patients\r\n and assist with the implementation of the activities.\r\n CES occurs more often in adults then in children. Men are more likely to be ill from this\r\n syndrome than women. Middle age is also a significant risk factor as this age population is\r\n more likely to develop problems with herniated disc.",

In many cases, the behavior is referred to as unconditioned or spontaneous motor activity because it has not been explicitly conditioned by the experimenter. The related term genera/ motor activity is commonly used when monitoring systems are employed that do not distinguish between different aspects of locomotor behavior; while the term locomotor activity is typically applied when ambulatory movements are monitored more specifically. Various instrumentally and operationally defined measures of motor activity have been used to assess the behavioral effects of drugs or other manipulations, either as strict measures of locomotor activity or as measures of more global and context-dependent constructs such as arousal, curiosity, emotionality, and exploration. In psychopharmacology, activity measures are often used as bioassays of drug effects or to establish macroscopic characteristics for drug classes. For example, psychoactive drugs are defined as stimulants or depressants largely on the basis of their effects on gross measures of the motor activity of rodents.",

A nivel biologico las alteraciones que se producen en el organismo debido a la malnutricion y las conductas purgativas deben ser tenidas en cuenta para no confundir las manifestaciones psicologicas debidas a alteraciones somaticas con trastornos de la personalidad, ni con interacciones familiares disfuncionales. Por otro lado el abordaje puramente somatico es necesario, ya sea normalizando las constantes vitales, recetando farmacos psicotropos, o regulando una dieta adecuada. A nivel psicologico las alteraciones de la personalidad previa, una deficiente autoimagen y baja autoestima que se asientan sobre una base depresiva, se ven incrementadas por las conductas alimentarias disfuncionales. Estas alteraciones psicologicas deben ser estudiadas en detalle para incluirlas como objetivo terapeutico (Espina, 2003). A nivel social, la moda de la delgadez y el exito en la sociedad occidental, hace que personas susceptibles sean mas vulnerables a padecer trastornos alimentarios. Por otro lado, las relaciones familiares pueden tener unas caracteristicas, especialmente la dificultad de autonomizacion de sus miembros y las alteraciones de la comunicacion, que son terreno abonado para la aparicion de trastornos alimentarios en personas susceptibles. Estos factores, junto con acontecimientos vitales estresantes (separaciones, perdidas, fracasos...), pueden jugar un papel etiologico y, cuando el TCA esta establecido, actuar como factores de mantenimiento (Espina, 1998a).",

Painful, sustained muscle cramps are usually associated with muscle stiffness. A careful history is paramount. Exercise-induced muscle cramps are usually myopathic (metabolic or mitochondrial myopathy) while resting, and nocturnal cramps are neurogenic [neuropathy, motor neuron disease (MND), etc.]. Metabolic cramps are electrically silent. Focal or generalized stiffness is typically seen in stiff person syndrome (SPS). Upper motor neuron (UMN) lesions are associated with spasticity and stiffness [hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), primary lateral sclerosis (PLS), myelopathies, etc.]. Painful cramps and fasciculation are important clues to peripheral nerve hyperexcitability disorder, which may also present with neuromyotonia. Not unusually, no cause is found for muscle cramps and stiffness. Symptomatic treatment frequently helps.",

      "abstract": "INSOMNIA IS A COMMON TREATABLE disorder of insufficient or poorquality sleep, with adverse daytime consequences. Insomnia presents as trouble falling asleep (long-sleep latency), trouble staying asleep (excessive or prolonged awakenings), or feeling nonrestored from sleep. Insomnia can be a primary disorder emerging in childhood or later, a conditioned (psychophysiological) disorder, or comorbid with a psychiatric, medical, or other sleep disorder. Insomnia can be transient (related to stress, illness, travel) or chronic (occurring nightly for 6 months). Persistent untreated insomnia is a strong risk factor for major depression. Insomnia must be distinguished from sleep-state misperception and short sleep states without symptoms. More than 50 epidemiological studies have shown that one third of various general populations have insomnia symptoms and that 9% to 21% have insomnia with serious daytime consequences, such as bodily fatigue, diminished energy, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, low motivation, loss of productivity, irritability, interpersonal difficulties (with family, friends, coworkers), increased worrying, anxiety, and depression. Chronic sleep loss, which occurs in untreated insomnia, is a major risk factor for fatigue-related automobile crashes and industrial accidents, loss of jobs, marital and social problems, poor health, metabolic and endocrine dysregulation with impaired ability to maintain weight control, coronary heart disease, major depression, and suicidality. Insomnia is associated with enormous direct and indirect costs, as much as $14 billion in the United States in 1995. Physicians should therefore establish an effective clinical strategy for eliciting and managing insomnia complaints. Use of a sleep-trained nurse, psychologist, or both on a consultation basis or as a member of the physician’s medical practice should be considered. One study has reported on the benefit of behavioral treatment of insomnia provided by a trained clinic nurse in a general medical practice. However, the cost-effectiveness of incorporating a sleep-trained nurse or psychologist into a medical practice has yet to be reported.",

The disturbances induced constitute a psychoneurotoxic syndrome--\"a state of drunkenness\"--of about four hours duration which develops in three distinct phases. The basic mental symptoms of this syndrome consist of disturbances of the apperception, sensory perception and emotion. A moderate impairment of egofunctioning or reality appraisal and an inability to integrate different mental processes are observed. The psychomotor behavior is mainly harmonized to the prevailing emotional state and to the experiences caused by perceptual alterations, in a lesser degree. These changes, according to our observations, are more severe and more \"psychotic-like\" in schizophrenics rather than in normals. Psychopathological analysis of these changes proves that the whole syndrome cannot be considered as related to the spontaneously triggered functional psychoses or to the organic ones and, therefore, the term \"model-psychosis\" according to our opinion, is unsatisfactory.",

      "abstract": "The fact that tics only occur in individuals of the degenerate class has been recognised by most writers on these affections. The aim of the present paper is to describe more fully the special mental state which accompanies the tic. The authors find the most constant features of that state in a weakness and instability of the will and the emotions, recalling conditions which are normal in childhood. This state of psychic infantilism is expressed in an inconstancy and variability of ideas, to which corresponds a similar variability of tic movements. Tics localised to particular muscles or groups of muscles similarly have their counterpart in such psychic abnormalities as fixed ideas, obsessions, etc. A tic may thus arise from an obsession if the besetting idea provokes a motor reaction; or, inversely, a tic may engender an obsession. The mental basis is similar in the two cases, and it is not rare to see obsessions and tics alternate or coincide in the same individual. The different varieties of phobia, the dilire du toucher, hypochondriacal doubts, etc., are mentioned as forms of obsession, common in the subjects of tic. The authors urge that it is important to distinguish the tics which belong to the fundamental state of psychic infantilism from those which are related to these secondary mental disorders. In the latter, which are harder to eradicate, it is necessary to direct treatment specially to the mental condition.",

      "abstract": "The author examines the possibility that repression has developed out of phylo- and ontogenetic precursors. The adaptive task of repression is to control instinctual behavior by screening out those stimuli (internal or external) which could trigger unacceptable behavior. Habituation, i.e., cessation of response to a repeated stimulis, is a mechanism for controlling behavior, with properties strikingly similar to repression. It operates by inhibiting sensory input, can discriminate and \"recognize\" the stimuli to be inhibited, and is impaired by brain damage, drugs (especially barbiturates), and perhaps also influenced by hypnosis. The author suggests that repression may be an evolutionary step from habituation, providing for inhibition of irrelevant as well as relevant but undesirable stimuli. In infants, habituation and withdrawal of attention from noxious stimuli operate through similar and perhaps identical mechanisms.",

      "title": "EPILEPTIC STEREOTYPIES",
      "abstract": "Stereotypies are defined as repetitive, similar, non-goal-directed (purposeless) movements. Purposeless repetitive motor behaviors are typical manifestations of seizures of temporal or frontal origin and are referred to as automatisms, or “epileptic automatisms” or sometime as “epileptic stereotypies” (Penfield,1959). In adults, they are usually recognized as clearly different from the normal patient's behavior, and also because there are other associated epileptic manifestations. When stereotypies are the only epileptic symptoms, and specially in young and developmentally abnormal children with mental retardation and particularly those within the autistic, spectrum, the diagnosis is more difficult because various types of non-epileptic stereotypies are common in these children in whom epilepsy is also quite frequent. In these children, subtle associated changes in awareness, vigilance or in cognitive capacity, suggestive of epilepsy may be difficult to recognize. It is exceptionally possible to show with simultaneous EEG recording that the repetitive abnormal movements are ictal or postictal manifestations. They probably represent the release of lower motor programs secondary to the epileptic activity. Sometime, they represent one among other signs of neurological dysfunction in children with so-called epileptic encephalopathies and can disappear when the epileptic disease is in remission, but the relationship with the epileptic activity per se is uncertain.. The diagnostic problems in differentiating between common stereotypies, complex tics, other dyskinesias and epileptic stereotypies will be discussed. In the latter instance, the movements can appear goal-directed and interpreted as such, even when they are not made with a deliberate intention (for instance, chasing an insect on one's face or looking at one's hand). They are not always similar with variations in intensity, rapidity and complexity from one episode of stereotypy to the next with no precise rythmicity. The circumstances of occurrence, the associated neurological signs or symptoms and the underlying pathological conditions are equally important diagnostic indices.",

Developmental stammering, regardless of country or language, affects one per cent of adult populations. Exacerbation by the stress of adult conversation or public speaking contrasts sharply with normal flow during singing, acting or conversation with children. Alterations in regional cerebral blood flow suggest that there are underlying differences in sensorimotor function in developmental stammerers whose symptoms commonly appear during the period of intensive language acquisition around the third and fourth year. Emotional tensions may exacerbate the disturbance, but equally psychological growth is adversely affected by the handicap. Abnormal motor control is confirmed by the exaggerated activity in the right hemisphere. The normal sequence of articulatory programming and motor preparation for single word reading is reversed. Absence of activation over the left auditory cortex supports the notion of impaired or diminished auditory feedback in the self-monitoring of speech seen in normal brains. Subcortical abnormalities are a feature of both developmental and acquired stammering.",

Normal psychological inhibitions of thinking can be subdivided into affect-induced inhibitions (\"affective inhibitions of thinking\") and those caused by habituated thinking or sets (\"habitual inhibitions\"). In affective inhibitions of thinking, a person who is in a state of affective arousal cannot solve a problem which he usually, i.e. in view of his intellectual capacity, is able to solve. Both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of inhibited thinking can be reliably identified by means of rearrangement tasks administered under adequate situative conditions. In several studies, carried out in various groups of subjects, marked decreases in problem solving performance occurred as a consequence of affective inhibitions of thinking. Disorganized thinking which is a typical result of affective inhibitions of thinking, can either be manifested in form of extremely rigid or chaotic behaviour. First results on the individual tendency towards or proneness to affective inhibitions of thinking and their relationship to personality traits are presented. --Based upon these findings on inhibited thinking, general conclusions are drawn for both the psychology of thinking and psychological diagnostics.",

      "abstract": "Unlike the internalizing domain of psychological problems, externalizing problems are not defined by the experience of inherently distressing emotions such as anxiety or sadness. Rather, they are defined by patterns of behavior that interfere with living a successful and satisfying life. People with high levels of externalizing problems are often very distressed, but they are mostly distressed by the consequences of their actions. Their inattentive, hyperactive, impulsive, irritable, oppositional, antisocial, callous, psychopathic, narcissistic, and histrionic behaviors and their abuse of, and dependence on, psychoactive substances interfere with functioning in school, work, and other settings; alienate peers and family members; and can lead to serious social consequences such as family conflict, being fired from employment, or incarceration.",

While conditions commonly associated with NP in adults may be less common in childhood (e.g. trigeminal neuralgia) other conditions (e.g. Fabry’s disease and erythromelalgia), may present with pain in childhood and present a diagnostic challenge for paediatric practitioners.",

This chapter provides a qualitative narrative review of hypothesized biological and neurocognitive mechanisms linking TBI to subsequent SBs. The following selective review specifically highlights: (1) Structural and functional alterations to neural circuitry secondary to common head injuries (e.g., concussions or mild TBI) as well as severe or repetitive TBI (e.g., chronic traumatic encephalopathy); (2) Overlap between post-TBI neuropsychological deficits and proposed bio-behavioral indicators of suicide risk; and (3) Potential neurocognitive mediators of the relationship between TBI and SBs, with a particular focus on executive functions involved in self-regulation (i.e., cognitive and affective inhibitory control) and their neural substrates, e.g., corticolimbic, frontostriatal, and frontoparietal circuitry. The chapter concludes with theoretical and practical implications of this shared pathophysiology, based on the reviewed empirical literature.",

In neurophysiological terms, pain is experienced when selected areas in the limbic system, particularly neurones in the cingulate gyrus and related areas of the somatosensory cortex are excited at the same time . Physiologically, this condition arises when nociceptors in peripheral tissues are stimulated, as is the case following trauma in acute pain or in inflammatory pain (nociceptive pain). However, it is not uncommon that excitation of limbic and related somatosensory cortical neurones originate from abnormal, usually damaged, peripheral or central nervous tissue (neuropathic pain) or as the consequence of psychological mechanisms (psychogenic pain). For the individual it does not matter how the typical state of limbic and somatosensory cortex excitation comes about, because the end result is just as unpleasant.",

The biological effects of vibrations depend on the frequency, amplitude, and duration of the vibration. The most unfavorable are those with a frequency of 100-250 and an amplitude of .005 mm. General vibrations over a prolonged period of time lead to a typical syndrome of vegetative dysfunction and angiodystonic effects on a neurological basis. In the cardiovascular system, these effects are normally in the form of spastic reactions and perinephritis. The genital system function is particularly sensitive to vibrative disruptions, increasing with the frequency of the vibrations (such as with vehicle operators). Menstrual dysfunction is the most common of such disruptions. The cardiac, nervous, and muscular types of anomalies are well documented. What is now encouraged is research into prophylatic measures to prevent such disruptions.",

It may involve muscle stiffness (spasticity), poor muscle tone, uncontrolled movements, and problems with posture, balance, coordination, walking, speech, swallowing, and many other functions. Motor performance is normally coordinated via communication between the cerebral cortex, thalamus, basal ganglia, brain stem, cerebellum, spinal cord and communicating sensory motor pathways. Mental retardation, seizures, breathing problems, bladder and bowel control problems, learning disabilities, skeletal deformities, dental problems, eating difficulties, digestive problems, and hearing and vision problems are also linked with this disorder. Cerebral palsy is non- curable in the accepted sense although several measures such as proper education, therapy and applied technology are being used to help persons who are suffering from this disorder and provide them productive lives. In order to approach cerebral palsy systematically, the medical practioners and physical therapists need to recognize neuromotor deficits, diagnose and classify the type of disorder, and implement a methodical treatment plan.

      "abstract": "Summary: Status epilepticus (SE) is denned as recurrent epileptic seizures without full recovery of consciousness before the next seizure begins, or more‐or‐less continuous clinical and/or electrical seizure activity lasting for more than 30 min whether or not consciousness is impaired. Three presentations of SE are now recognized: recurrent generalized tonic and/or clonic seizures without full recovery of consciousness between attacks, nonconvulsive status where the patient appears to be in a prolonged “epileptic twilight state,” and continuous/repetitive focal seizure activity without alteration of consciousness. Generalized convulsive status epilepticus (GCSE) encompasses a broad spectrum of clinical presentations from repeated overt generalized tonic‐clonic seizures to subtle convulsive movements in a profoundly comatose patient. Thus, GCSE is a dynamic state that is characterized by paroxysmal or continuous tonic and/or clonic motor activity, which may be symmetrical or asymmetrical and overt or subtle but which is associated with a marked impairment of consciousness and with bilateral (although frequently asymmetrical) ictal discharges on the EEG. Just as there is a progression from overt to increasingly subtle clinical manifestations of GCSE, there is also a predictable sequence of progressive EEG changes during untreated GCSE. A sequence of five patterns of ictal discharges has been observed: discrete electrographic seizures, waxing and waning, continuous, continuous with flat periods, and periodic epileptiform discharges on a relatively flat background. A patient actively having seizures or comatose who exhibits any of these patterns on EEG should be considered to be in GCSE and should be treated aggressively to stop all clinical and electrical seizure activity to prevent further neurological morbidity and mortality.",

      "title": "Neuorodevelopmental examination of the child with neuropsychiatric problems",
      "abstract": "First of all, it is important to realize that the neuropsychiatric diagnosis of a child with neuropsychiatric problems is often (although by no means always) a long and sometimes complicated task without short cuts. The child and adolescent presenting with neuropsychiatric symptoms always needs a neuropsychiatric work-up comprising a psychiatric examination and a neurodevelopmental evaluation. Laboratory work-up of some kind is often required also as is a neuropsychological assessment. It is always difficult to draw the clinical line in deciding what is (and what is not) a ‘neuropsychiatric symptom’. Whenever there is a suspicion of a named disorder reflecting brain problems, a genetic disorder or when there are symptoms such as social withdrawal, empathy deficits, psychotic symptoms (hallucinations, delusions, confusion), pervasive attention deficits, learning problems, motor control problems, tics (motor or vocal), grossly disturbed eating behaviour, or significant weight loss in children or adolescents, a full neuropsychiatric work-up is always required. The neurodevelopmental work-up includes a detailed family history, review of the pregnancy and early developmental history, evaluation of social and academic settings and a developmental and neuromotor evaluation.",

      "title": "[Causes, diagnosis and treatment of neurogenic dysphagia as an interdisciplinary clinical problem].",
      "abstract": "The intricate mechanism of swallowing can be divided into three phases: oral, pharyngeal, and esophageal. Dysphagia is a disruption in the swallowing process, which include difficulty in transporting (or a lack of transporting) a food or liquid bolus from the mouth through the pharynx and esophagus into the stomach. Causes of disruptions in the swallowing process can be divided into superior (oropharyngeal) and inferior (esophageal) according to Paradowski et al. Neurlologic dysphagia may be caused by a disruption in different parts of the central nervous system (supranuclear level, level of motor and sensory nuclei taking part in swallowing process, peripherial nerves level and a pathology of muscle cells and spindles) or neuromuscular and muscular disorders. Neuromuscular disorders causes according to Waśko-Czopnik et al. are: stroke, brain tumors, brain injury, bulbar and pseudobulbar paralysis, neurodegenerative diseases (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis), tabes dorsalis, multisystem degenerations, Parkinson's disease, delayed dyskineses, Huntington's disease, myasthenia and myasthenic syndromes, myopathies and peripherial neuropathies. The correct diagnosis evaluation include history taking, physical examination with palpation and consultations (laryngological, gastrological and neurological). According to Halama radiological esophagogram, videofluoroscopy, flexible endoscopic examination, ultrasound examination, manometry, electromyography, scintigraphy and 24 hour pH monitoring are main diagnostic procedures of dysphagia. Some of the reasons for the neurologic dysphagia may be treated by surgical and pharmacological methods. Neurologic dysphagia rehabilitation is difficult, long-lasting and often falling far short of expected results. Primary it should include neurologic cause treatment if it is possible. According to WHO International Classification of Functioning and Health in 2001 non-invasive methods of dysphagia treatment may be divided into reconstitution, compensatory and adaptive techniques. The most popular reconstitution methods are thermal stimulation (Lazzar's) or tactilethermal application (Rosenbeck's) techniques which may be applied for abnormal duration of stage transition (DST). Abnormal duration of stage transition considerably increase probability of aspiration. Dysphagia treatment by compensatory methods consist in various techniques of swallowing and posture changes application. Adaptive techniques include dietary changes--avoiding of sustenances strengthening dysphagia and adequate dietary intake. The basic principle of dysphagia rehabilitation is that the most effective way to regain efficiency is the regeneration on remains of lost function. Carrying out imperfect swallowing acts is probably the best way of increasing effectiveness and efficiency of swallowing. On the other hand imperfect swallowing acts may be hazardous because of the danger of aspiration and inhalation pneumonia.",

      "abstract": "Tics are brief, sudden movements (motor tics) or sounds (phonic tics) which are intermittent but may be repetitive and stereotypic (Jankovic, 2001; Singer, 2005). Transient tic disorder is the mildest and most common cause of tics. Although these tics usually resolve in childhood, some may persist and become associated with a variety of comorbid disorders such as attention deficit disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder. Tourette's syndrome (TS), considered a genetic and neurodevelopmental disorder, is the most common cause of chronic tics (Jankovic, 2001; Albin and Mink, 2006). There are many other causes of tics which are referred to as “tourettism” or secondary tics. Other causes of tics in particular include insults to the brain and basal ganglia (infection, stroke, head trauma, drugs, and neurodegenerative disorders) (Jankovic & Mejia, 2006). The currently used diagnostic criteria for definite TS formulated initially by The Tourette's Syndrome Classification Study Group (1993) include: (1) multiple motor tics; (2) at least one vocal tic (not necessarily concurrently); (3) a waxing and waning course with increasing severity over time; (4) tic symptoms for at least one year; (5) onset before age 21 years; (6) no precipitating etiologies such as illnesses or drugs; and (7) observation of tics by a medical professional (Jankovic, 2001).",

These movements were absent during sleep. The neurological examination, neuroimaging, and electroencephalography was otherwise normal. Surface electromyography of the mentalis muscle demonstrated a tremor frequency of 8 Hz ([Video 2]). Quivering chin syndrome is a rare movement disorder. It may be sporadic or inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion with incomplete penetrance with locus on chromosome 9(9q13-q21). These involuntary, paroxysmal, rhythmic, movements of the chin and/or lower lip may last from seconds to hours.[1] Episodes occur spontaneously or may be precipitated by stress and emotion. Usually no treatment is required. When indicated, injection of low-dose botulinum toxin into the mentalis muscle or low-dose clonazepam may be helpful.[2] Recognition of this rare entity is important to avoid unnecessary investigations.",

Tic improvement by young adult years is common, but its mechanism and predictive factors are unclear.

The clinical course of PLOSL can be divided into four stages: 1 The latent stage is characterized by normal early development. 2 The osseous stage (3rd decade of life) is characterized by pain and tenderness, mostly in ankles and feet, usually following strain or injury. Fractures are typically diagnosed several years later, most commonly in the bones of the extremities. 3 In the early neurologic stage (4th decade of life), a change of personality begins to develop insidiously. Affected individuals show a frontal lobe syndrome (loss of judgment, euphoria, loss of social inhibitions, disturbance of concentration, and lack of insight, libido, and motor persistence) leading to serious social problems. 4 The late neurologic stage is characterized by progressive dementia and loss of mobility. Death usually occurs before age 50 years. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of PLOSL can be established in a proband with radiologically demonstrable polycystic osseous lesions, frontal lobe syndrome, and progressive presenile dementia beginning in the fourth decade. Identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in TYROBP or TREM2 can confirm the diagnosis if radiographic and clinical features are inconclusive. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is symptomatic. Orthopedic surgery and/or devices may be of value in individual cases. Antiepileptic drugs can be used to prevent epileptic seizures and secondary worsening of the condition. Prevention of secondary complications: Some of the social consequences of PLOSL may be avoided if family members are informed early about the nature of the disorder. Surveillance: Intervals for follow up of bone lesions and neurologic and psychiatric manifestations must be determined on an individual basis. Genetic counseling PLOSL is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for a TREM2 or TYROBP pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk are possible if the pathogenic variants in the family have been identified.",

      "title": "Overreaching/Overtraining",
      "abstract": "Are you struggling with your exercise/conditioning routine or feeling a bit washed out, stale, and drained? Perhaps your muscles are persistently feeling heavy, stiff, a bit sore, and your exercise program has ceased to be enjoyable. If so, you may be suffering from a condition referred to as \"overreaching\" or, in more severe cases, \"overtraining syndrome.\" Overreaching is broken into functional and nonfunctional states, both of which respond to extra rest. Nonfunctional overreaching leads to a more extended period of decreased performance than functional overreaching and is accompanied by neuroendocrine and/or psychological symptoms. Overtraining is considered severe nonfunctional overreaching that results in a prolonged performance decrement (>2 months) and more severe symptoms. Effective conditioning requires a balance between intense training sessions and periods of rest/recovery. Too much overload and/or not enough recovery can result in both physiological and psychological symptoms that limit performance and may cause one to cease participation in a previously enjoyable activity. In many noncompetitive exercisers, the condition is often the result of inadequate rest/recovery because of busy work lives, family, work and health stressors, meal skipping, and poor sleep. Exercise can become addictive because of the effects of endorphins, dopamine, and other exercise-generated factors on the brain. This addiction can easily result in frequent intense training sessions that are not interspersed with adequate recovery periods. This phenomenon, especially when combined with the increasing popularity of intense multievent endurance competitions and intense group training programs, places individuals at increased risk for developing a nonfunctional state and, in more severe cases, overtraining syndrome. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS More than 125 signs and symptoms have been identified in published literature, making a definitive diagnosis challenging. The most common symptoms include: • Persistent heavy, stiff, and sore muscles • Persistent fatigue, washed-out feeling • Decreased performance and ability to maintain the training regimen • Increased susceptibility to infections, colds, headaches • Nagging and somewhat chronic injuries • Sleep disturbances • Decreased mental concentration and restlessness • Increased irritability • Depression • Tachycardia and, in some cases, bradycardia • Loss of appetite and weight loss • Bowel movement changes • Absence of menstruation TREATMENT AND PREVENTION The primary treatment is rest and, with more severe cases, an extended break from training. Improved quality of sleep, appropriate nutrition and hydration, and addressing nonexercise stressors are essential for full recovery. In some cases, your physician may choose to rule out other potential organic causes related to a variety of illnesses and health conditions. Prevention of nonfunctional overreaching and overtraining is critical to continued enjoyment of and benefit from your exercise training program. Following are a few key tips: • Listen to your body and take extra recovery time as indicated. • Follow the 10% rule; don't increase training volume and/or intensity by more than 10% at a time. • Follow a periodization format; intersperse periods of intense/high-volume training with extended periods of rest/recovery and/or cross-training. • Recovery/rest between intense workouts is critical because this is when muscle tissue repair and growth occur; usually 24 to 72 hours depending on the intensity and volume of the session. • You shouldn't feel wiped out following a hard workout; you should feel like you could do more; if not, you are doing too much. • Proper nutrition and hydration are important; consulting a sports dietician may be helpful. • Quality sleep is essential. • Variety in your training is healthy; don't do the same thing all the time. Maintaining a training log can be helpful in identifying periods of overreaching and the need for extra recovery. Include variables such as your resting heart rate, sleep, weight (for weight loss), mood, workout intensity/duration, and how muscles and joints respond. With appropriate recovery and using a periodization plan for your long-term training, you will be able to minimize the risk of overtraining and keep your exercise and competitions fun and enjoyable.",

The aetiology of epilepsy in children is multifactorial with congenital, metabolic, infective, and problems associated with prematurity being common causes. Nearly 3 million Americans have epilepsy. About 450,000 of them are under 17 years old. About 1 in 200 children (0.5%) have epilepsy, a neurological condition where children have a predisposition to recurrent, unprovoked seizures. There are many different types of epilepsy, especially in infancy, childhood and adolescence. Epilepsy can be thought of in terms of either: the site of seizure origin in the brain (generalised or focal seizures), or the underlying cause. Genetic epilepsies (formerly called idiopathic or primary epilepsies) occur in an otherwise normal person and are due to a genetic predisposition to seizures. Some epilepsies are due to an underlying abnormality of the brain structure or chemistry (formerly called symptomatic or secondary epilepsies). Other epilepsies have no known cause. Epilepsy is commonly diagnosed in children and can be confused with other conditions. An accurate diagnosis is essential. A seizure is an excessive surge of electrical activity in the brain that can cause a variety of symptoms, depending on which parts of the brain are involved. Seizures can be provoked or unprovoked. Provoked seizures, caused by fever in a young child or severe hypoglycemia, are not considered to be forms of epilepsy. Unprovoked seizures have no clear cause but can be related to genetics or brain injury. When a child has two or more unprovoked seizures, epilepsy is often the diagnosis. Despite advances in antiepileptic medication therapy, a significant number of pediatric patients with epilepsy have seizures that are not well controlled. Antiepileptic medications interact with anesthetic agents, and common anesthetics can precipitate or suppress seizure activity. There are important pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between AEDs and drugs commonly used in anaesthesia. These affect both drug efficacy and the risk of seizure activity intraoperatively.",

Oromandibular, lingual, laryngeal and cervical dystonias can occur as part of a generalized neurodegenerative disorder or can be a focal primary dystonia.3, 4 Focal primary dystonias of the head and neck can be task specific where the dystonic action is triggered by speaking. In some cases, the dystonic action can be overcome with a “geste antagoniste” or sensory trick. Tactile or sensory stimulation in the region of the affected muscle group causes relaxation of the dystonic muscles.5 Understanding the particular muscle involved in the dystonia and that muscle’s normal function is important to diagnose and treat cranio-cervical dystonias.",

      "abstract": "A variety of reactions are observed after a major trauma. In the majority of cases these resolve without any long-term consequences. In a significant proportion of individuals, however, recovery may be impaired, leading to long-term pathological disturbances. The most common of these is post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which is characterized by symptoms of reexperiencing the trauma, avoidance and numbing, and hyperarousal. A range of other disorders may also be seen after trauma, and there is considerable overlap between PTSD symptoms and several other psychiatric conditions. Risk factors for PTSD include severe exposure to the trauma, female sex, low socioeconomic status, and a history of psychiatric illness. Although PTSD may resolve in the majority of cases, in some cases risk factors outweigh protective factors, and symptoms may persist for many years. PTSD often coexists with other psychiatric disorders, such as depression, anxiety disorders, and substance abuse, and with physical (somatization) symptoms. There is growing evidence that PTSD does not merely represent a normal response to stress, but rather is mediated by specific neurobiological dysfunctions.",

      "title": "CONSISTENT PATTERNS IN SECONDARY HEALTH EFFECTS OF DISASTERS",
      "abstract": "Most disasters produce a consistent pattern of death and injury. Primary causes are directly attributable to the event itself and thus vary by event type, e.g., drowning in tropical storms and floods, direct trauma in earthquakes and tornados. Secondary causes vary less by event type as they are driven by common effects: loss of electrical power and shelter, transportation disruption, loss of healthcare access, attempted repair/restoration, and other disruption of daily routine. Primary and particularly secondary causes may be difficult to attribute, typically leading to undercounting. Secondary causes of death, illness, and injury can be divided into four broad categories: pre-existing medical conditions, environmental degradation or magnified exposure, secondary trauma, and psychological effects. Pre-existing medical conditions include common non-communicable diseases that are typically medication-controlled (e.g., cardiorespiratory ailments, diabetes, psychological disorders), rely on recurring procedures (e.g., hemodialysis for end-stage renal disease), or a combination; some conditions require regular oxygen administration, powered life-support equipment, or other adjuncts. The link among all is the dependence on maintenance care, the disruption of which turns a chronic, relatively stable condition into an acute one at the worst possible time. Environmental causes include unmediated exposure to ambient environment, degraded air and water quality (including otherwise-controlled infectious diseases), and introduced toxicants (most commonly carbon monoxide). Secondary trauma includes motor-vehicle collisions, electrocution, and other injuries, particularly those related to repair and short-term recovery. Psychological causes include response to the primary event beyond effects of pre-existing conditions: disruption to lifelines and routine and extended effects (e.g., prolonged outages, seismic aftershocks, personal loss). Most secondary health effects of disasters are predictable and can be prevented or at least lessened by the combination of awareness and deliberate action by governments, institutions, support services, and individuals. In actual practice, secondary effects recur in most events and see limited preventive measures.",

      "abstract": "Introdução: O Transtorno de Pânico é uma condição psiquiátrica debilitante caracterizada por episódios recorrentes e inesperados de medo intenso, conhecidos como ataques de pânico. Esses ataques são frequentemente acompanhados por sintomas físicos. A etiologia é multifacetada e complexa, envolvendo uma combinação de fatores genéticos, biológicos, psicológicos e ambientais. A prevalência estimada ao longo da vida é de 2%-3% da população geral. O presente artigo tem por objetivo revisar a literatura sobre os sintomas cardiorrespiratórios associados ao Transtorno de Pânico. Materiais, sujeitos e métodos: Para a elaboração deste artigo, foram consultados artigos científicos e artigos de revisão publicados e referenciados na BVS, SciELO e Medline/PubMED entre 2014 e 2024. Resultados e discussão: Os sintomas físicos mais comuns no Transtorno de Pânico são os cardiorrespiratórios, como taquicardia, dispneia, sudorese, tremores e sensação de asfixia. Os ataques geralmente atingem o pico em minutos e podem durar de minutos a uma hora, deixando o indivíduo exausto e apreensivo em relação a futuros ataques. O tratamento é através de uma abordagem multimodal que engloba psicoterapia e farmacoterapia. Considerações finais: Os sintomas do Transtorno de Pânico são variados e podem ser extremamente debilitantes para os pacientes no aspecto físico e mental. A compreensão dos sintomas é essencial para um diagnóstico precoce e um tratamento eficaz. A abordagem terapêutica deve incluir terapia cognitivo-comportamental, medicamentos e técnicas de relaxamento com o intuito de ajudar os pacientes a gerenciar seus sintomas e recuperar uma vida plena e funcional.",

      "abstract": "IntroduçãoA trombose venosa cerebral (TVC) é uma forma rara de acidente vascular cerebral, mais prevalente entre as mulheres. Seu diagnóstico, muitas vezes, é desafio clínico devido aos seus variados padrões de apresentação; por essa razão, pode ser negligenciado não apenas por médicos gerais, mas também em alguns casos por neurologistas. Vários sintomas, incluindo dor de cabeça grave, visão anormal, desmaio ou perda de consciência, fraqueza da face, membros e convulsões podem ocorrer. Embora possa ser apresentada com diferentes sintomas neurológicos, na TVC normalmente não ocorrem alucinações.Relato de CasoUm homem saudável de 59 anos foi internado com queixas de episódios recorrentes de dor de cabeça no último mês e subsequentes alucinações visuais, especificamente prosooometamorfopsia - ele relatou ter visto imagens distorcidas de rostos e objetos. Não foi associado a nenhuma reclamação sensorial ou motora. O exame médico e neurológico geral na admissão estava intacto, incluindo estado mental, exame fundoscópico, nervos cranianos, motor, sensorial, coordenação e reflexos. Ele não tinha meningismo. O exame de sangue revelou uma alteração na proteína C-reativa (9,4 mg/L) e o líquido cefalorraquidiano apresentou apenas pleocitose linfocítica. Realizada a tomografia computadorizada de crânio que mostrou uma lesão cortical hipodensa mal definida na região temporal e occipital direita. A ressonância magnética confirmou a presença de trombose venosa cerebral nos seios sigmoides e transversais. Paciente foi tratado com heparina de baixo peso molecular seguido de varfarina, mas as alucinações visuais permaneceram. Optou-se por iniciar corticosteroide. Após excelente recuperação dos sintomas, em uma investigação mais aprofundada para trombofilias, ele foi considerado positivo para a mutação no gene da protrombina. O paciente assinou o Termo de Consentimento Livre e Esclarecido e foram utilizados apenas prontuários médicos para a elaboração desse relato.ConclusãoPor essa razão, as ilusões devem ser adicionadas ao já amplo espectro de apresentação clínica da trombose venosa cerebral. Esse diagnóstico pode ser considerado, ainda, em pacientes que apresentam alucinações auditivas e visuais súbitas, particularmente no contexto de cefaleia e com fatores de risco convencionais para trombose venosa cerebral.",

      "abstract": "Some psychiatrists attribute great importance to the neuro-insane diathesis as a factor in the causation of insanity, whilst others belittle its influence. The term is misleading, for it suggests that this diathesis is confined solely to the mentally afflicted, and, further, its precise meaning is vague. A person is generally accused of possessing the neuro-insane diathesis if he presents a temperament which appreciably diverges from the mean of the sanguine and of the phlegmatic; if his actions are unduly strenuous or torpid, his expressions unwarrantably enthusiastic or lukewarm, his moods very variable or religiously constant; in brief, the neuro-insane diathesis may be resolved into a tendency to psychic or motor reaction disproportionate to the exciting stimulus. In common speech the person is emotional. But every person who is emotional is not an incipient lunatic. The faculty of conceiving undue enthusiasm, of persevering unfalteringly in ambition, in order to attain the acme of success in any sphere of life, demands an emotional power in excess of the normal. It is ridiculous thus to brand the best men of all nations as possessors of the neuro-insane diathesis. The term, with its plausible air of scientific accusation, is misleading and vague, and should be wholly discarded. All that psychiatrists wish to convey by it may be more accurately and more descriptively called the emotional diathesis.",

      "title": "What Acute Stress Protocols Can Tell Us About PTSD and Stress-Related Neuropsychiatric Disorders",
      "abstract": "Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), the fifth most prevalent mental disorder in the US, is a chronic, debilitating mental illness with as yet limited options for treatment. Hallmark symptoms of PTSD include intrusive memory of trauma, avoidance of reminders of the event, hyperarousal and hypervigilance, emotional numbing and anhedonia. PTSD is often triggered by exposure to a single traumatic experience, such as a traffic accident, a natural catastrophe, or an episode of violence. This suggests that stressful events have a primary role in the pathogenesis of the disorder, although genetic background and previous life events are likely involved. However, pathophysiology of this mental disorder, as for major depression and anxiety disorders, is still poorly understood. In particular, it is unknown how can a single traumatic, stressful event induce a disease that can last for years or decades. A major shift in the conceptual framework investigating neuropsychiatric disorders has occurred in recent years, from a monoamine-oriented hypothesis (which dominated pharmacological research for over half a century) to a neuroplasticity hypothesis, which posits that structural and functional changes in brain circuitry (largely in the glutamate system) mediate psychopathology and also therapeutic action. Rodent stress models are very useful to understand pathophysiology of PTSD. Recent studies with acute or subacute stress models have shown that exposure to short-time stressors (from several minutes to a few hours) can induce not only rapid, but also sustained changes in synaptic function (glutamate release, synaptic transmission/plasticity), neuroarchitecture (dendritic morphology, synaptic spines) and behavior (cognitive functions). Some of these changes, e.g., stress-induced increased glutamate release and dendrite retraction, are likely connected and occur more rapidly than previously thought. We propose here to use a modified version of a simple and validated protocol of footshock stress to explore different trajectories in the individual response to acute stress. This new conceptual framework may enable us to identify determinants of resilient versus vulnerable response as well as new targets for treatment, in particular for rapid-acting antidepressants. It will be interesting to investigate the putative prophylactic action of ketamine towards the maladaptive effects of acute stress in this new protocol.",

Suicide may be the end-point of a number of different contributing factors. It is more likely to occur during crisis periods associated with divorce, alcohol and drug abuse, unemployment, clinical depression and other forms of mental illness. Because of this, suicide is often used as a proxy indicator of the mental health status of a population. However, the number of suicides in certain countries may be under-estimated because of the stigma that is associated with the act, or because of data issues associated with reporting criteria (see “Definitions and deviations”).",

My disabilities after the strokes lay not only in the mechanical execution of commands and the ability of contraction of muscles, but also in mental processes like perception, attention, memory, and thought. These impediments have meant drastic changes in my living conditions and social status. My disability was multifaceted and involved my whole person. Its expression was somatic, psychic, and behavioural. I suffered from loss of appetite, disturbance of sleep, psychic anxiety, depression, anguish, aggressive reactions, communication difficulties, disorganization of conduct, and so on. My personality no longer matched up to my own expectations. I was trapped in a situation of impossibility of living, despair, and hopelessness. I was confronted with a problem I could not circumvent, and I had insufficient skills available to solve it. I had fallen into a state of nothingness. My life was in crisis.",

In serious situations, it might show as a dissociative disorder, which extremely impairs psychological functioning. Dissociative trance, a type of other specified dissociative disorder (OSDD), is characterized by an abrupt loss of awareness, leading to unresponsiveness and involuntary actions. Despite being conscious, the individual may feel separated from their body, as if it were under the control of an external force. This case report represents a 22-year-old patient with no prior criminal history who experienced episodes of decreased consciousness, altered identity, and involuntary movements. These episodes were perceived as being controlled by an external force and culminated in a tragic event leading the patient to kill her children. After ruling out other potential causes like psychotic disorders, organic factors, and substance abuse, a diagnosis of dissociative trance disorder was considered. Treatment with cognitive behavioral therapy, antidepressants, antipsychotics, and benzodiazepines resulted in improvement of the patient's symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is characterized by recurring and repetitious thoughts coupled to anxiety characterized by obsessive thoughts and associated compulsive behavior(s). OCD patient often fears that the anxiety will not abate and obsessional thoughts will control her/his mind or body in advocating or carrying out unwanted compulsive behaviors. Such thinking patterns or behaviors may often be frightening but usually they are quite harmless except when promoting accompanying anxiogenic activity. Confused thinking may be severe enough to cause functional impairments when obsessions or compulsions dominate mental status. In OCD, disrupted thoughts and actions may dominate the normal conduct of everyday tasks. Anxiety caused by obsessive thoughts is usually relieved by time-consuming and significant effort-requiring compulsive behaviors. Compulsive activities like diversionary counting, checking behavior (e.g., like repeatedly checking whether the stove is on or off), or excessive cleaning activity dominate the response to obsessive thoughts. Excessive hand washing (sometimes called the Pontius Pilot Syndrome) occurring as a compulsive behavior, not only relieves the causal obsession but serves as a “refresh button” (i.e., like that found on a computer)--clearing the mind of obsessions, compulsive urges, and extraneous thoughts. The major extracts of the Cannabis sativa plant are primarilydelta9-THC (causing intoxication, psychosis, often anxiety) and secondarily the non-psychotomimetic compound Cannabidiol (CBD). Studies have found multiple therapeutic actions in the uses of CBD—with anxiolytic activities (i.e., opposing the anxiogenic actions of delta9-THC), anti-psychotic activities, and lessening of the compulsions that occur with OCD and other psychiatric conditions.

The stimulus will be transferred to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, and may then, depending on facilitating or inhibiting modulation, be conducted through the spinothalamic tract to the medulla oblongata (1,2). Here, in the hypothalamus and the thalamus, additional processing takes place before the information is translated into the sensation of \"pain.\" The subjective feeling of pain may be influenced by further factors such as distraction.

Lacking identifiable medical or neurological etiology, children with DCD often have preserved intellectual abilities. Comorbidity is common, including ADHD and specific learning disability. Despite extensive evidence of significant impact on daily activities and academics due to differences in motor behaviors, DCD difficulties are regularly treated as behavioral problems. Method Neuropsychological evaluation of an 8-year-old boy with a possible reading delay and inability to perform some age-appropriate academic and self-care tasks. Results Average overall ability with very strong verbal performances; intact visual perceptual processing, memory, and non-written language. Academics are within expected range, although graphomotor weakness impacted academic performances on tasks with written demands. Patient appeared clumsy and awkward with low muscle tone, poor balance, and difficulty learning new motor skills. Impaired fine motor control, handwriting, gait, gross motor skills, motor planning, coordination, and oromotor weakness as well as inferior verbal language abilities were evident. Impulsivity, inattention, poor planning, and poor self-monitoring were also evident. Conclusions DCD is evidenced by impairment in fine and gross motor skills, oromotor skills, motor planning, energy, and coordination with clear discrepancy between motor abilities and abilities in other areas, specifically language. In our case, DCD features were overlooked despite wide ranging impact. ADHD and SLD with impairment in written expression were concurrent. This case highlights the need for greater appreciation of DCD so that children can benefit from early detection and intervention considering the life-long implications of the disorder.",

      "title": "Overtraining from a sports psychiatry perspective",
      "abstract": "Overtraining is characterized by a mismatch between exerted strain and exercise tolerance. Overtraining is generally not sufficiently feared nor is enough attention paid to its prevention. As a result, the first warning signals and symptoms are often either perceived too late or there is a delay in the correct interpretation of signs. This often leads to negative consequences over months, which, in turn, can lead to more frequent injuries as well as Depression. Due to the increasing professionalism and density of competition in competitive sports, overtraining occurs more frequently as athletes are left with a shorter period of time to recover. In order to treat overtraining, it is first necessary to identify the syndrome. Symptoms are often disregarded and trainers and athletes attempt to compensate for poor performance with excessive training. This leads to a vicious cycle with significant reduction of the overall performance of the athlete as a consequence. Psychological parameters can also be signs of non-func-tional overload. Examples include restlessness, irritability, emotional instability, recurring states of fear, emerging indifference or reduced performance motivation. However, disturbed cognitive processes as an impairment of central elements of movement control can also occur. As part of sports psychiatric support, conspicuous psychological parameters can be recorded and contextualised. The Synergetic Navigation System (SNS) is available for systematic recording and corresponding process management. The Synergetic Navigation System (SNS) can be used as an instrument for load, training and competition control to prevent non-functional overload and overtraining. It is also suitable for promoting performance and preventing injuries as well as stabilizing the psychological structure.

Tic disorders are characterized by multiple sudden, rapid, recurrent, and non-rhythmic movements (motor tics) or utterances (vocal tics), or both. They fall under the category of neuropsychiatric disorders. Tic disorders pertaining to nails, also known as compulsive nail disorders, include onychophagia, habit tic deformity, onychotillomania, perionychotillomania, onychotemnomania, onychotieromania, onychodaknomania, bidet nails, and others. Onychophagia, onychotillomania, and habit tic are the most common nail tic disorders where the patient has a habit of nail biting and nail picking, respectively. Nail tic disorders are not only limited to cosmetic disfigurement of the nail, but may be associated with psychopathological states that can affect patient's quality of life. Each such case should be addressed with a detailed history, physical examination, and psychiatric evaluation in selected cases. Diagnosis is based on history and clinical examination but histopathology may be required in special circumstances. Management includes both non-pharmacological and pharmacological modalities. Proper counseling and cognitive behavioral therapy play an important role in the management. The choice of pharmacological agent depends on the type of nail tic disorder and its severity.",

      "title": "Nociception and Acute Pain: Ascending Functional Structure and Descending Modulation",
      "abstract": "Pain is – a pain in the neck, isn´t it? Yes and no. Yes, it hurts. Yet, it helps. At least do acute and transient pain. Acute pain resulting from an acute event is a fundamental condition for survival, insofar as it warns against imminent or actual tissue damage, a potentially life-endangering threat. The importance of the physiological, protective role of nociceptive pain is underscored by cases, in which a failure to sense pain such as in the case of congenital insensitivity often leads to self-mutilation, bone fractures, joint deformities, amputations, and even early death. While the goal of acute pain based on nociception thus appears to be clear, its implementation is anything but that because to achieve this goal calls for a number of requirements to be fulfilled. The first is the identification of a noxious stimulus, including its intensity and location on the body surface or within the body. The second is the orchestration of counter-measures, including arousal, emotional and various motor reactions. The third is the mobilization of the required energy as well as cardio-vascular and respiratory responses. All this implies multi-dimensional activations of diverse neural and neuro-muscular systems. This review attempts to describe the structures and mechanisms underlying nociception and pain in quite some detail to emphasize their complexity. It starts with a structural description of the nociceptive and pain system in an ascending order, from peripheral nociceptors to supraspinal structures involved in nociceptive and pain processing. This is followed by a description of the systems organizing descending pain modulation. The focus will here be on acute pain. It turns out that even acute nociception and pain and the underlying neural systems are very complex. There are many reasons for this complexity. First, many neuronal nodes receive multifarious inputs and send multiple outputs to other nodes, which often have additional functions other than nociception and pain. This constitutes an extended, multi-functional, multiple input-multiple output network. Second, individual nodes often have an inhomogeneous structure chracterized by diverse neuron groups and inter-connections. Third, sub-cellular processes are complex, but will not be treated here. It comes as no surprise, then, that we face difficulties in dealing with pain and its clinical consequences, and find appropriate treatments. It will not suffice to manipulate a single screw or only a few.",

      "title": "Animal well-being. III. An overview of assessment.",
      "abstract": "Assessment of animal well-being is a complex matter. It is difficult to establish a causal link between stimuli and internal state because of numerous variables and the time interval between cause and effect. Many studies document a correlation rather than a causal relationship among stimuli, responses, and subsequent health, disease, or mental state. Research objectives are often vague, the choice of assessment parameters is perplexing, and the results are difficult to interpret. In general, animal well-being cannot be assessed directly. There are no standardized methods or specific endpoints that provide an objective determination. Overt changes in physical and psychological functions occur only after the animal has experienced a prepathologic state. An animal's response to general arousal, life's events, and aversive stimuli depends on an integrated activation of various neural and endocrine factors. A variety of physiologic, biochemical, and behavioral characteristics change when an animal is exposed to aversive situations and stimuli, although many also change with the onset of positive general arousal, such as play, pleasant experiences, and sexual excitement. There is a need to evaluate numerous criteria (e.g., performance, clinical state, neurochemistry, endocrinology, immunology, morphology, behavior, and ethology) to compile a complete mental and biological profile of animals. The various systems, processes, and individual specific responses are interrelated and interact in a well-structured manner. Given the complexity of the topic and the disparate disciplines involved, developing a comprehensive understanding of animal well-being is not straightforward. Consequently, observers should be cautious. Foremost in any determination of animal well-being is assurance that criteria being used are relevant to well-being.",

Abnormal falling developed when he learned to walk. No similar cases are known in his family. Physical examination revealed hyperreflexia. Pathologic startle reflex was elicited by light touching on the patient's nose, clapping or making other noises. EEG response to startle stimuli consisted of spikes recorded from both centroparietooccipital regions immediately preceding diffuse muscle and movement artifacts. The motor responses to auditory stimuli, which are startle reflex on the orbicularis oculi, sternocleidomastoid, biceps and quadriceps femoris muscles, habituated within 2–4 trials. Electrical stimulation of the median nerve at the wrist elicited a consistent C reflex (cortical long loop reflex) but not any giant cortical somatosensory evoked potentials. Our patient showed early disease onset and habituation of motor response, which are not seen in other essential hyperekplexia cases, and clinically differs from the patients with hereditary hyperekplexia in which neonatal rigidity, epilepsy, apneic attacks, low intelligence, congenital dislocated hips and inguinal hernia can be seen in differing frequency.",

About 100,000 Americans have full-blown Tourette's syndrome, but more people have a milder form of the disease. It often starts in childhood, and more boys than girls get it2. The exact cause of Tourette syndrome is not known. It is a complex disorder likely caused by a combination of inherited (genetic) and environmental factors. Chemicals in the brain that transmit nerve impulses (neurotransmitters), including dopamine and serotonin, might play a role1. Tics can be simple or complex. A simple tic affects one or just a few parts of the body, like blinking the eyes or making a face. A complex one involves many parts of the body or saying words. Jumping and swearing are examples. Symptoms often get better as children grow up. For some people, they go away completely3. Although there is no cure for Tourette syndrome, treatments are available. Many people with Tourette syndrome donot need treatment when symptoms are not troublesome. Tics often lessen or become controlled after the teen years. People with Tourette syndrome often lead healthy, active lives. However, Tourette syndrome frequently involves behavioral and social challenges1.",

      "title": "I paint, I sing, I dance; I also have a mental illness: The importance of personally meaningful leisure activities in recovery from severe mental illness",
      "abstract": "Individuals with severe mental illness (SMI) often have sedentary and secluded life. It leads to compounded psychological and physical effects in the form of feeling isolated, having an increased propensity for lifestyle-related illnesses, and the like.[1] It affects the perception of others also, which often manifests as a narrow and negative approach to the patient and their problems. This approach creates an impression that the patient and their issues are inseparable and that their life revolves around those problems. It leads to neglect and underestimation of the patient's abilities, hobbies, and likings. For example, a patient with schizophrenia may be perceived as someone with eccentricities (e.g., talks to self) who does not adequately involve in daily living activities and remains secluded. Unfortunately, a patient may imbibe these perceptions leading to self-stigma, which, in turn, can affect their overall functioning.[2] It is, therefore, imperative that intervention for mental illness has a strength-based approach that focuses on the person's abilities apart from the target to improve the symptoms. Motivating patients to engage in personally meaningful activities they enjoy can be a step in this direction. It does not only defocus the attention of the patient and the caregivers from a \"symptom only\" approach but also help make the patient active, participative, and involved in what interests them. Given this, therapeutic recreation is being advocated as one of the ways to promote health and wellness in individuals with mental illness.[3] Therapeutic recreation promotes positive behaviour, such as social connectedness and cooperation, by involving people in therapeutic residential camping, leisure activities, and the like. Involving people in such leisure and recreational activities can be an effective way of reinvigorating those self-soothing and enjoyable activities that get subdued in the inactive life of mental illness. Furthermore, patients can be involved in such goal-driven recreational activities that reduce the illness effects. For example, specially designed cognitively stimulating recreational activities can effectively reduce the cognitive impairments commonly observed in people with severe mental illness. Likewise, group activities can help enhance social skills, decrease apathy (and other negative symptoms), and improve interpersonal skills. THE RESEARCH EVIDENCE Of late, there has been a surge of interest in understanding the effectiveness of leisure activities in promoting the psychological and social well-being of people with mental illness. Research indicates that involvement in personally meaningful leisure activities can boost recovery and aid toward active living for people with mental illness.[4,5] For example, enjoyable leisure activities and perceived active living consistently correlate with a sense of well-being and recovery.[5–7] Therapeutic recovery camps, aiming to involve participants in physically and mentally challenging activities, have been found to lead to a sense of determination to overcome the challenges caused by mental illness.[3] Activities that involve adventure and fun (such as rock climbing, picnic, and skating) can be physically stimulating, weight reducing (a common requirement in mental illness due to metabolic abnormalities), and a boost to self-esteem.[8] Also, leisure activities can act as a protector from mental illness. For example, a sense of meaningful use of time through leisure activities is associated with lower depressive symptoms.[9,10] NOT \"ONE FIT FOR ALL\" Since recreational and leisure activities can significantly boost the psychological and social well-being of people with mental illness, these activities must be part of the overall intervention plan. While doing this, a few things need to be kept in mind. For example: The activities chosen must be personally meaningful for the individual. The contribution of leisure activities in recovery and active living largely depends on what meanings the patients gain from those activities.[4,5] Perception of an activity to be personally meaningful motivates the individual to engage and continue it. For example, realizing that doing yoga with friends brings a positive mood, helps companionship, and revitalizes spirituality can be a driving force for engaging in it regularly.[4] Iwasaki and colleagues suggest that leisure activities can be meaningful for an individual if they promote a sense of belongingness, autonomy, competence, and other factors.[5] Active living does not limit to some physical exercises; it also involves activities that augment body-mind-spirit harmony and promote emotional health, social connectedness, creativity, and so on.[11] Recreational and leisure activities should be planned in a manner that it incorporates the patient's needs. For example, a patient with cognitive deficits can be involved in such activities that are cognitively stimulating. Involving patients to work in groups to create Rangolis (an art in which an array of colors is precisely used to create designs on the floor) can be an enjoyable activity with the potential to improve attention. INDIAN SCENARIO Unfortunately, there is a paucity of research from India about the effectiveness of therapeutic recreational activities for people with SMI. It has significant implications; for example, even if some centers involve patients in recreational activities, they are not guaranteed to be effective. At NIMHANS, we have started a structured recreational program that involves patients in various leisure activities according to their choice. A preliminary study shows that the patients perceive the benefits of these activities in terms of the experience of positive emotions, opportunities for social interactions, and the like.[12] We need more research exploring the utility of various approaches to actively include patients and their caregivers in focused recreational and leisure activities, such as recreational camping for a longer duration. We must remember that symptom amelioration is not the sole target of working with people with mental illness. Recovery is a broader concept with a strength-based perspective to enable an individual to lead a meaningful life and utilize their potential to the fullest. Recreational activities can serve as an important medium to attain this goal. Financial support and sponsorship Nil. Conflicts of interest There are no conflicts of interest.",

While the psychiatrist may be able to differentiate between an unconscious variety of hearing loss, which might be considered as a conversion reaction or so-called hysterical deafness, and the conscious type of assumed loss, which is properly termed malingering, the audiologist is usually in no",

Una persona puede sentirse profundamente afectada mientras que otra poco o nada presenta efectos adversos, es por ello que se cree pertinente reconocer el factor que desencadeno la crisis provocando vulnerabilidad que excede los recursos actuales del individuo y las estrategias previas de afrontamiento. Cuando no se puede asimilar, adaptar, poner en marcha nuevas formas de afrontamiento y control de emociones podria llegar a presentar un mayor deterioro y el desarrollo de conductas destructivas, entre ellas la conducta suicida. La conducta suicida es una de las principales causas de lesiones y muertes alrededor de todo el mundo, es un fenomeno complejo y multifactorial, conformada por ideas suicidas, autodano, crisis suicida, intento autolitico y suicidio; sin embargo la deteccion temprana de factores de riesgo y proteccion implicados permitiran abordar este problema bajo un meticuloso proceso. Se conoce que puede originarse en respuesta a una crisis de la vida cotidiana y a crisis psicopatologicas determinando el abordaje terapeutico. Las intervenciones basadas en evidencias incluyen procedimientos disenados para atacar directamente el riesgo suicida. Las intervenciones que han demostrado mayor eficacia segun varias revisiones sistematicas han sido todas aquellas de tendencia cognitivo conductual, entre ellas terapia dialectico conductual, de resolucion de problemas y mindfulness, debido a que han ayudado significativamente a la reduccion de pensamientos, desesperanza y la conducta suicida ademas las ganancias realizadas a menudo se han mantenido con el tiempo.",

      "title": "Stress and immunity: minireview.",
      "abstract": "Stress, a state of threatened homeostasis, may be induced by various physical or psychological factors (stressors), including antigenic stimulation. Stressful experiences may affect both physical/psychological well being and immune functioning of humans and animals; the ongoing immune reaction may affect other physiological functions and psychological comfort. The molecular basis of these effects involves a network of multidirectional signalling and feedback regulations of neuroendocrine- and immunocyte-derived mediators. The consecutive stages of the multistep immune reactions might be either inhibited or enhanced owing to the previous and/or parallel stress experiences, depending on the kind of stressor and the animal species, strain, gender, or age. Therefore, the final results of stress-induced alteration of immune reactions are difficult to predict. The effect of a particular stressor on immune functions varies according to the previous stress experience of the individual (e.g. social confrontation, sterile saline injection) while various stressors may act in the same or in opposite ways on the same immune parameter. In general, the efficacy of immune response depends on the neuroendocrine environment on which it is superimposed. Conversely, neural and endocrine responses depend on the concurrent immune events upon which they are superimposed. It seems that the consequences of stress on the immune functioning are generally adaptive in the short run but can be damaging when stress is chronic.",

      "abstract": "Sensory-perceptual alteration can be defined as when there is a change in the pattern of sensory stimuli followed by an abnormal response to such stimuli. Such perceptions could be increased, decreased, or distorted with the patient's hearing, vision, touch sensation, smell, or kinesthetic responses to stimuli. Such changes in the pattern of responses to stimuli lead to changes in a patient’s behavior, sensory acuity, decision-making process, and problem-solving abilities. This can lead to irritability, restlessness, poor concentration, fluctuating mental status, changes in communication due to inattention, and lack of focus. Furthermore, sensory deprivation in isolated patients can lead to anxiety, depression, aggression, hallucinations, and psychotic reactions. Any alteration in a patient's normal environment can result in stress especially if such alteration is involuntary. Sensory overload occurs when an individual experiences a stimulus that they are unable to manage and process. Usually, the second stimulus is filtered out by selective perception or coping behavior. However, in certain environmental conditions such as the emergency department, or due to specific underlying illnesses such as dementia, sensory overload can occur due to inadequate filtering of stimuli.Sensory deprivation occurs when an individual receives a stimulus that is reduced or below the threshold of normal. Risk factors to such alterations can be broadly due to acute illnesses, patient factors related to chronic medical conditions, aging, or due to environmental or iatrogenic causes. This typically occurs when the patient is placed in isolation, such as changes in the environment due to hospital admission or admission to isolated wards. While in isolation, there can be a reduction in the quantity and quality of stimuli and restriction of social interaction. Other risk factors that can lead to increased or decreased alteration in the processing of stimuli can be due to hearing impairment, loss of vision, loss of smell or taste, aging, trauma, electrolyte imbalance, seizure disorder, mental health problems, and genetic causes.",

Paroxysmal attacks start in infants but neurological deficits become progressive with the age.During the last 20 years 8 patients (5 boys, 3 girls) with AHC were followed. Mean age at the time of diagnosis was 2.75 years, age range 2-5 years; mean follow up period 13.9 years (range 1 month-20 years) The diagnosis was based on clinical history and neurological findings, completed by neurophysiological and neuroimaging methods (SPECT, PET), and results of psychological and biochemical findings. Paroxysmal phenomena (occulo-motor, tonic, choreo-athetotic, autonomic) appearing at the age of 4.1 +/- 2.2 months and followed by repeated attacks of hemiplegia (age onset 16.3 +/- 13.0 months) were the first symptoms. Progressive neurological impairment covering spasticity, dyskinetic syndrome, cerebellar ataxia and intellectual deficit was present in all cases, epileptic seizures in 7 out of 8 patients. On ictal SPECT/PET examination hypoperfusion/glucose hypometabolism were demonstrated above affected hemispheres including basal ganglia, both thalami and cerebellar hemispheres. Improvement of hemiparesis was illustrated by nocturnal videomonitoring.AHC is a chronic disease with progressive neurological deficit. A flunarizine therapy has a favorable effect on frequency and severity of paroxysmal attacks, but does not prevent a progressive neurological impairment.",

Psycho(patho)dynamic analyses of suicidal acts disclosed that in a portion of the suicide attempts there is no or at least no determined suicidal intent. The definition of 'suicidal attempt' which has come into general use is therefore imprecise, because in many cases suicide is not \"attempted\" but the technique of suicidal behaviour is only used for a primary non-suicidal purpose. A differential typology of the entire content of the concept of 'suicide attempt' which includes vague non-homogeneous matters has become unavoidable and is being discussed here. In the suicidal behaviour of children the problems become even clearer. The 'suicide attempt' in children does not meet Stengel's criteria. The great majority of cases are not 'attempted' suicides, do not show a final determination, do not come about in a calculated manner, and are not based on an ambivalence about life and death, but are rather a potentially fatal substitution by suicidal behaviour for a demonstrative appeal for help, for a resigned escape signal or for an impulsive cry. Neither can one recognize the development of the pre-suicidal syndrome described by Ringel.",

Positive symptoms should then be considered psychologic pathology - that is, symptoms developed “de novo” as unique manifestations of the illness itself. A three-step model for the development of negative symptoms has been suggested: the first step is anhedonia, which is a loss of hedonia, such as lack of empathy or lack of drive. The second step is the lack of spontaneous, communicative language leading to symptoms like “conceptual disorganization”. The third step in the negative process is the deterioration into dementia. It is argued that quality of life scales for schizophrenia focus mainly on the social consequences of negative symptoms.□ Anhedonia, Negative process of schizophrenia, Psychopathologic theories, Quality of life.",

Ergebnisse Psychische Beeinträchtigungen/Störungen können als Reaktion auf chronischen Pruritus auftreten, z. B. als Anpassungsstörungen, depressive Störungen, Angststörungen. Psychische Faktoren können auch in Entstehung und Verlauf eines chronischen Pruritus eine Rolle spielen, entweder im Zusammenspiel mit organischen Ursachen oder bei deren Fehlen als somatoformer Pruritus oder Pruritus bei coenästhetischer Schizophrenie. Ferner können selbstinduzierte Kratzartefakte mit oder ohne Pruritus im Rahmen von Störungen der Impulskontrolle, Zwangsstörungen oder Artefaktstörungen auftreten. Auch eine primär unabhängige Komorbidität mit einer sonstigen psychischen oder psychosomatischen Störung kann das Management des Pruritus erschweren und den Krankheitsverlauf beeinflussen. Es werden Hinweise zur Diagnostik der genannten Faktoren gegeben. Diskussion Die Diagnostik psychischer Einflussfaktoren und psychischer Aspekte des chronischen Pruritus ist komplex.

      "title": "PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS IN MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS",
      "abstract": "The incidence of psychiatric disorders in multiple sclerosis is higher than is generally recognized. The majority of multiple sclerosis patients show emotional instability, denial, personality disintegration and, in the late stages, deterioration. The emotional instability is manifested by irritability, anxiety and depression, as well as euphoria, even to the extent of a manic or depressive psychosis. Denial is manifested by querulousness and projection of frustration and hostility onto other people, or by unrealistic optimism. Personality disintegration is manifested by subjectivity, lability, inappropriateness and poor coordination of emotional reactions with the rest of the personality and the reality of the situation. The organic interruption of subcortical pathways by demyelinization produces variable loss of emotional control and disorganization of the total personality. This threat to personality functioning produces the compensatory psychological defense mechanisms of denial and projection. Emotional instability may precede the onset of neurologic findings, and the final diagnosis may be obscure for months or years. Although emotional stress does not cause multiple sclerosis, it can precipitate exacerbations and have a deleterious effect on the course of the disease. Because there is no definitive treatment, psychotherapy is an important, if not the most important, part of the treatment of multiple sclerosis. Psychiatrists are, therefore, especially qualified to treat patients with multiple sclerosis.",

Attempted suicide is common in patients with psychiatric disorders, and may also occur in individuals with physical health problems. Suicide, even when completed, is not without meaning. Suicidal ideation is often triggered by feelings of hopelessness or social isolation. Individuals who commit suicide have usually indicated their wish to die either directly or indirectly prior to the suicide attempt. Persons who undertake suicide attempts usually go through the stages of contemplating suicidal ideas as a possibility to terminate intense suffering, which is followed by a period of ambivalence and narrowing of perceived alternative options before a final decision is made. Suicide attempts with terminal intent can be classified as desperate or impulsive. In a minority of cases, suicide is altruistically motivated, and such behaviour may not necessarily be associated with psychopathology.",

      "abstract": "Symptoms of traumatic brain injury (TBI) tend to be primarily related to cognitive deficits involving the frontal and temporal brain areas as a result of biomechanical forces involving the bone and soft tissue of the head. Motions of acceleration and/ or deceleration can result in tissue strain, leading to hematomas and diffuse axonal injury. Alterations in blood flow, metabolic dysfunction, disruption of the bloodbrain barrier, calcium dysregulation, free radical formation, excitotoxicity, axonal damage, apoptosis (neuronal cell death), cerebral edema or brain swelling, and ischemia are possible factors involved in the pathophysiological cascade that can be initiated by TBI (Jain 2006; Mendez and Ardila, 2006; Sinson and McIntosh, 2006; and Stein, 2006). Focal TBI results from either contusions, or bruising involving these two brain areas, coup-contrecoup contusions, or penetrating injuries. Contusions tend to be involved as part of a larger picture of deficits from diffuse TBI although they can occur independently. Delayed neurobehavioral deterioration can occur following brain injury as a result of changes that occur from intracranial hematomas, diffuse cerebral swelling, considerable axonal injury, and further cellular changes resulting from the brain's increased sensitivity to secondary ischemic insult. Molecular events, such as the elevation of cytokines and changes in neurotrophic factors resulting in increased oxidative stress, can occur in even mild TBI.",

Breath-holding spells (BHS), tics, syncope, gastroesophageal reflux (GER), and sleep disturbances all may be mistaken for seizures, but important distinguishing features can help the clinician differentiate these entities from a true seizure.\n\nLike seizures, seizure-like states are paroxysmal events that have a discrete onset, ending, and return to baseline. The duration, frequency, and clinical characteristics are different for each entity and help the clinician distinguish among them, usually on the basis of history and physical examination, sometimes with the aid of additional diagnostic testing.\n\nSeizures are disturbances of the central nervous system characterized by phenomena that the patient cannot control, with or without a concurrent loss of consciousness. There may be major motor manifestations. The range of clinical seizures extends from subtle behavioral arrests (absence seizures) to the more obvious generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Generally, consciousness is lost, and the postictal period of drowsiness or decreased responsiveness following the episode often lasts 21/2 times the length of the actual paroxysm. If the paroxysm is momentary, a postictal period may not be identifiable.\n\nBHS are common, peaking in children between 2 and 3 years of age, although even infants may have them. Commonly, those who hold their breath outgrow their spells by 5 or 6 years of age. BHS are characterized by the child’s apparent inability to breathe, accompanied by a change in color, limpness, and collapse, followed briefly by a return to baseline. The duration usually is less than 1 minute. Generalized tonic movements from brief cerebral ischemia may accompany BHS, but do not imply any increased risk of epilepsy in the future. Clinically, BHS can be categorized as pallid or cyanotic. The parents often describe the child as becoming frustrated and crying prior to cyanotic episodes and having suffered minor trauma, …",

Background electrical activity is always present and spontaneous changes in activity occasionally appear, even when it seems that an individual is relaxing or asleep. This makes the task of recording and correctly interpreting a subject's evoked response to a specific stimulus or situation a challenge. Most psychophysiological recordings can be analyzed in terms of three types of activity: spontaneous, tonic (background), and phasic (evoked responses). Tonic activity is often referred to as the background level or resting level of activity of a particular physiological measure, while phasic activity is a discrete response to a specific stimulus — an evoked response. What is referred to as spontaneous activity is in reality a change in physiological activity that occurs in the absence of any known stimuli.",

      "title": "Autoimmune mediated suicidal behavior",
      "abstract": "There is a known autoimmune disease, which is called ‘anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis’, or ‘Dalmau encephalitis’ (named after its discoverer). It is associated with the presence of high titers of antibodies to a certain epitope of the NR1 subunit of NMDA receptors in the blood and/or in the cerebrospinal fluid. This disease in its classic form is accompanied by severe mental (depression, delusions, hallucinations, anxiety, sleep disorders, cognitive impairment, catatonia, etc.) and neurological (convulsions, dyskinesias) symptoms, disturbances of consciousness and autonomic regulation (regulation of respiration, temperature, blood pressure, heart rhythm), as well as with suicidality, which seems to be disproportionate to the severity of mental disturbances. However, there are also ‘non-classical’ forms of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis. These can manifest with exclusively psychiatric symptoms (for example, depression, psychosis, suicidal behavior), without characteristic neurological symptoms and/or disorders of autonomic regulation. In some of these cases, the correct diagnosis of anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis was delayed by months, years or even decades. In addition, in recent decades, increasing evidence had accumulated that in some patients with so-called ‘classical’ mental disorders, such as schizophrenia, bipolar affective disorder, depressive disorders – and especially in those who show resistance to traditional psychopharmacotherapy – elevated titers of anti-NMDA receptor antibodies can be detected in their blood and/or in their cerebrospinal fluid. It has also been shown that elevated blood titers of anti-NMDA receptor antibodies are often detected in post-mortem examinations of suicide victims. Anti-NMDA receptor antibody titers in psychiatric patients correlate well with a recent history of suicide attempts and/or with current active suicidal ideation. Some of these patients may benefit from aggressive immunosuppressive therapy that is similar to the regimens normally used to treat ‘classical’ anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis with neurological and autonomic manifestations. This might stop their suicidal ideation and/or help in overcoming their resistance to psychopharmacotherapy. This article presents a description and analysis of three clinical cases of patients with various mental disorders, acute suicidality and elevated titers of anti-NMDA receptor antibodies, in whom such therapy has been effective.",

      "abstract": "Introduction. Motor stereotypies are almost always associated with developmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability, etc. Although they most often occur together with sensory deprivation, they are also recognized as isolated. They occur in children with normal, typical development. These isolated stereotypies are called primary motor stereotypies. Aim. The aim of this paper is to provide a better insight into the specificity of this disorder and to show how it affects people (children), as well as to provide insight into the cause of primary motor stereotypies and possible approaches to treatment. Method. Descriptive method with a review of the literature published in the previous ten years, with a critical review. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were defined. Research on the cause of primary motor stereotypies, primary motor stereotypies themselves, and the treatment of primary motor stereotypies was reviewed. Results. Primary motor stereotypies in children with typical development negatively affect daily activities and disrupt social development, which leads to social stigmatization. Many interventions have been found in children with autism spectrum disorder (stereotypies are one of the main features of autism), but there is very little published research on interventions and treatments for primary motor stereotypies. The root of the problem of primary motor stereotypies is complex and involves certain parts of the cortex and pathways of information transmission. The problem is also the identification of this problem, which further affects the interventions themselves. Conclusion. The cause of primary motor stereotypies is still unknown, and behavioral therapies are the possible treatments for primary motor stereotypies. Based on the available research, there is not much literature on this topic, which provides us with exceptional potential and space for discovering new information and knowledge. With new information, there are many ways to work with these people.",

      "title": "Unraveling the enigma of ‘Psychological Pillow’: A unique catatonic phenomenon",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor, Psychological pillow, a rare catatonic sign. Pathophysiology includes dysregulation of motor circuit loops, namely Cortico-subcortico-cortical loop (movement initiation/inhibition), cortico-thalamo-cerebello-subcortical loop (modulate movement dynamics/timing), cortico-cortical (regulate the speed and organization of motor activity). Specifically, which circuit dysregulates is a matter of ongoing debate55,56. The right inferior parietal cortex is proposed to be the structure involved in these functions, and dysfunction possibly results in posturing.[1,2] A 22-year-old male, Hindu by religion, educated up to the 5th grade, and from a low socioeconomic background, was brought to the psychiatric outpatient clinic. He had a history of repeatedly fleeing from home for 3 years, harboring suspicions about family members, frequent self-muttering and disrobing of clothes, along with unprovoked physical or verbal aggression. Additionally, the patient experienced gradually progressive stiffness in all four limbs, mutism, episodic agitation, and bizarre posturing that persisted for 22 weeks. Notably, the patient would often assume a unique posture resembling \"Psychological pillow,\" where their head and trunk were lifted above the pillow for several minutes to half an hour, even when lying supine on the bed [Figure 1]. There was no indication of substance abuse, drug use, or medication causing these symptoms. The patient's family believed that a malevolent spirit had possessed his body, leading them to consult multiple local faith healers. Previously, the patient received medical advice at a district hospital and was prescribed olanzapine 10 mg and lorazepam 2 mg, but did not comply adequately or make successive visits. Relevant investigations including brain Imaging, CSF analysis, and Electroencephalogram (EEG) were unremarkable. Baseline Bush Francis catatonia rating scale score (BFCRS) was 32, and Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) score was 85. With a diagnosis of catatonia associated with schizophrenia, the patient was treated with intravenous lorazepam gradually up-titrated to 4 mg three times daily, along with other measures like proper hydration, input/output measurement, vital monitoring, and postural care. Risperidone (oral dissolving) tablets were also introduced and up-titrated in divided doses. The BFCRS scale score was reduced to 15 after the resolution of catatonic symptoms. Within a week, the patient's catatonic symptoms showed improvement with a maintenance dose of lorazepam at 8 mg per day and risperidone up-titrated to 8 mg daily dosing. However, there was minimal change (76) in the BPRS score from the baseline in 2 week's time. For ensuring compliance, the patient was advised to use a long-acting depot injectable (intramuscular Flupentixol 40 mg) monthly upon discharge. During the follow-up visits to the outpatient psychiatry department at 2 weeks, the patient achieved BFCRS scores of 8, and BPRS score came down to 66.Figure 1: Psychological PillowClinical presentation of catatonia is extremely diverse, and till now, 40 different catatonic symptoms have been identified.[3] Among all these signs, perhaps the most peculiar and unusual sign is posture, in which affected individuals maintain an unorthodox bodily position for a sustained period against the effect of gravity, with complete akinesia.[4] The patient can remain fixed in that respective position for a variable amount of time (hours, days, sometimes weeks). Characteristics peculiar to psychological pillow firstly include the absence of fatigue or extra effort to maintain this bizarre posture, and secondly, it is usually painless for the patient. A literature search on PubMed and Google Scholar for case reports in the English language depicting catatonia and psychological pillow revealed 16 case reports of catatonia with features of psychological pillow [Table 1]. It was present in patients of all age groups (ranging from 14 years to 87 years) and in patients with mood disorders as well as psychotic disorders. In a few cases, other medical causes like poisoning or systemic lupus erythematosus were found. The treatment basically involved treating the primary cause. Despite its rarity, recognizing this phenomenon can lead to timely and targeted interventions, significantly impacting patient outcomes. However, the enigma surrounding the underlying pathophysiology of \"psychological pillow\" remain unexplained. Further studies are required to unravel its association with specific neural circuits or structures.Table 1: Summary of reviewed Case reports of Catatonia with Psychological Pillow signDeclaration of patient consent The authors certify that they have obtained all appropriate patient consent forms.

      "abstract": "The term \"theory of mind\" (ToM) refers to the capacity to infer one's own and other persons' mental states (e.g. their beliefs, feelings, intentions or knowledge). It was found that children in the autistic spectrum have deficits in ToM. One of the suggestions was that unlike autistic people, ToM skills are normally developed in schizophrenia patients, but \"lost\" in the first psychotic episode. The deficit may disappear on remission from the acute phase, as described in some studies. A substantial body of research has highlighted the impaired ToM in schizophrenia. There is good empirical evidence that ToM is specifically impaired in schizophrenia and that many psychotic symptoms--for instance, delusions of alien control and persecution, the presence of thought and language disorganization, and other behavioral symptoms--may best be understood in light of a disturbed capacity in patients to relate their own intentions to executing behavior, and to monitor others' intentions. However, it is still under debate how an impaired ToM in schizophrenia is associated with other aspects of cognition, how the impairment fluctuates with acuity or chronicity of the schizophrenic disorder, and if it is a state or trate marker. The paper reviews the current literature and suggests potential implications and future research areas.",

Seizure should be differentiated from syncope, migraine, transient ischemic attack, multiple sclerosis, hypoglycemic attack, sleep disorder (narcolepsy/ cataplexy/night terror, rapid eye movement behavior disorder), anxiety attacks, and pseudoseizure (psychogenic nonepileptic seizure). Routine workup for onset of unprovoked seizure in adults includes blood count, chemistry profile, EEG, and neuroimaging (computed tomography scan, MRI). Further workup depends on individual case (lumbar puncture). Late onset of seizures is usually because of vascular, degenerative, and neoplastic processes. However, more than half of the patients remain idiopathic, which is possibly genetically determined. Family history of seizure, previous history of head trauma, and prior history of seizure including febrile convulsion in childhood are important to establish.",

      "abstract": "Single and repeated sports-related mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), also referred to as concussion, can result in chronic post-concussive syndrome (PCS), neuropsychological and cognitive deficits, or chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). However PCS is often difficult to diagnose using routine clinical, neuroimaging or laboratory evaluations, while CTE currently only can be definitively diagnosed postmortem. We sought to develop an animal model to simulate human repetitive concussive head injury for systematic study. In this study, mice received single or multiple head impacts by a stereotaxic impact device with a custom-made rubber tip-fitted impactor. Dynamic changes in MRI, neurobiochemical markers (Tau hyperphosphorylation and glia activation in brain tissues) and neurobehavioral functions such as anxiety, depression, motor function and cognitive function at various acute/subacute (1-7 day post-injury) and chronic (14-60 days post-injury) time points were examined. To explore the potential biomarkers of rCHI, serum levels of total Tau (T-Tau) and phosphorylated Tau (P-Tau) were also monitored at various time points. Our results show temporal dynamics of MRI consistent with structural perturbation in the acute phase and neurobiochemical changes (P-Tau and GFAP induction) in the subacute and chronic phase as well as development of chronic neurobehavioral changes, which resemble those observed in mTBI patients.",

      "title": "Reactive psychoses revisited",
      "abstract": "Objective and Method: This paper describes the overlap between reactive (psychogenic) psychosis and other brief psychotic episodes, and explores the gradual disappearance of reactive psychoses as a distinct nosological entity from international classifications. Clinical and conceptual issues concerning reactive psychosis are examined on the basis of a critical review of major classical and modern papers. A brief illustrative case history is also provided.Results: Reactive psychoses are conceptualised as severe disturbances of mental state, on occasion chameleon-like in their shifting form and content, arising in response to a stressful event or life situation. Reactive psychoses have an abrupt onset and usually run their course to complete resolution in a matter of days or weeks. Precipitants include overwhelming fear, threat of imminent destruction, social isolation (as can occur with imprisonment, immigration or deafness), bereavement and intense sexual or interpersonal conflicts. The emergence of a reactive psychosis usually occurs against the background of a predisposing vulnerability in terms of personality disorder, organic impairment, or a history of sensitising experiences, occasionally operating in combination.Conclusions: The increasing failure to recognise reactive psychoses diminishes clinical psychiatry because it removes an important opportunity for understanding mental disorder in terms of an integration, and totalisation, of developmental history, psychological makeup, social context and current realities, and in so doing lessens our awareness of the links between psychosis and our common humanity.",

Schizophrenia has a strong genetic component but non-genetic factors (substance abuse, urbanicity, migration, advanced paternal age, and obstetric complications) make a significant contribution. Antipsychotic medication is the most effective intervention for symptom control and relapse prevention.

      "abstract": "In an evolutionary model, health and disease are regarded as successful and respectively failed adaptation to the demands of the environment. The social factors are critical for a successful adaptation, while emotions are means of both signaling the organism's state and of adapting the physiological responses to environmental challenges. Hence the importance of a biopsychosocial model of health and disease. Psychoemotional distress generates and/or amplifies somatic symptoms. Somatization may be viewed as an altered cognitive process, inclining the individual to an augmented perception of bodily sensations and to an increased degree of complexity in reporting negative experiences (hence the greater cognitive effort allocated thereto). Somatosensory amplification and alexithymia are key elements in this process. The brain's right hemisphere is more involved in the generation of emotionally conditioned somatization symptoms. Somatic symptoms have various psychological and social functions and are strongly influenced by the particular belief system of the individual. Inappropriately perceiving the environment as an aggressor and excessively responding to it (by activating the cytokine system in correlation with the arousal of the psychic, nervous, and endocrine systems) may be a key element in the altered cognition conducive to ill health.",

The interaction of predisposed and causal factors is unknown. Stress, overall fatigue, anxiety, depression and/or certain personality traits (which complicate or hamper coping) are considered as perpetuating factors. In any case, overlaps between voice symptoms and reactive psychic as well as social problems have to be kept in mind (e. g. the burden of suffering, depressive processing, speaking anxiety, socially withdrawal). Because the association of multiple psychosocial factors with functional dysphonia is not distinct--such are always existent in organ medically unexplained symptoms--functional dysphonia has to be diagnostically differentiated.

      "abstract": "As Far As We Can Tell, Two Powerful Brain Events Always Occur with Sexual Experience:* Attachment (bonding) to the sexual partner* Desire for repetition of sex acts (addiction)Sex may not always lead to permanent attachment or uncontrolled addictive behavior because of multiple other influences (family, faith, control of actions by higher brain centers, etc.) But observations of brains with new imaging techniques and of behavior suggest that sexual experience can have a powerful brain impact.1 PET scans can identify specific areas of the brain involved when a person is interested in another person, but cannot distinguish between lust and Only time and other behaviors can reveal the difference.2* Lust is a powerful emotional state and can cause people to do things that they would not ordinarily do, often for self-gratification.* Early is a powerful emotional state, which can last several months and cause people to think of doing things they would not ordinarily do.* Mature love is the deep, abiding love of a couple that stays together and follows the healthy evolution of early love. It is the stability of this mature love on which marriage, home, & family depend.3A separate brain area for pain has also been identified. The brain lights in the same area if it's physical pain, like a broken bone, or emotional pain, like a broken relationship.4 Emotional Consequences of Sexual Activity with broken relationships:* Pain and suffering from broken relationships* Fear, confusion about romantic feelings* Altered self-esteem* Sense of betrayal and abandonment* Guilt, depression and emotional rollercoaster* Impaired ability to form healthy long-term relationshipsBroken bonding may explain a large percentage of adolescent depression. According to a national survey of teen health, girls who were sexually active were three times more likely to be depressed than those who were abstinent. Suicide is attempted more often by sexually active teens than those who have not had sex: three times more often by girls and eight times more often by boys.5Sex & Depression - College Students* 30% of students reported they felt so depressed that it was sometimes hard for them to function.* 6% of students reported seriously considering attempting suicide at least once during the past year and 1.3% had actually attempted suicide.6Damage to the Human Bonding Ability* Individuals who have had multiple sexual partners prior to marriage are more likely to divorce when they do marry than individuals who did not have multiple partners prior to marriage.* Couples who cohabit before committing to marriage are more likely to divorce when they do marry than couples who did not cohabit.'Young Women Are More Vulnerable to premature sexual activity. They are much more likely to be pressured for sex8 and their behavior decisions can be influenced unconsciously.9* By pheromones. Young women are sensitive to pheromonal concentrations as little as l/100th of a drop. These powerful chemicals influence desire for sex, and cause the young womans mood to brighten and mental focus to sharpen, increasing propensity to sexual behavior.* By release of oxytocin with sexual activity. Oxytocin not only makes them bond it can also make them trust. More women than men say their beloved's faults don't matter much to them and women score higher on the test of passionate love.The Emotional TruthsFifty percent of teen relationships break within six months of beginning a sexual relationship. Many teens report two weeks is common length of relationships. This has spawned the concept of up = sex without relationship. Hooking results in unhealthy molding of the brain. More sex partners may lead to attachment difficulty. Brain molding that result from incomplete or unhealthy attachments is a threat to one's emotional and physical health. …",

      "abstract": "The data concerning neurophysiological and neurotransmitter mechanisms of two principal kinds of inhibition of behavior is carried out: the inborn genetically determined inhibition and that developed in the course of training. On the basis of the experiments performed by the author and the literature on general neurophysiology the conclusion is made that development of inhibition of behavior during training (i.e. internal inhibition, including \"latent inhibition\") is determined by the relative strengthening of inhibitory hyperpolarization processes either locally (in a conditioned stimulus analyzer) or globally in the brain cortex and other brain structures during intensification of the inhibitory state (profound inhibition of a reflex and sleep). The main neurotransmitter in development of internal inhibition is gamma-aminobutyric acid. Inhibition of behavior without preliminary training arises either during the action of superstrong stimuli, (exceeding the maximum value inhibition) or during interaction of two and more active systems. A stronger one of these two systems suppresses another one (external inhibition, dominant inhibition, \"freezing\", \"prepulse inhibition\", etc.). These kinds of inhibition develop on the background of EEG activation, which suggests participation in their realization of reticular structures and corresponding neurotransmitters (acetylcholine, noradrenalin, dopamine and serotonin). Behavior pathology causes a break of the balanced interaction between the excitation and inhibition in the central nervous system. This affects both genetically determined forms of behavior inhibition and the learned internal inhibition.",

Pathological processes affecting these regions, such as Parkinson's disease or stroke, are often associated with ED. Parkinsonism's effect may be caused by the imbalance of dopaminergic pathways. In patients with spinal cord injury, the degree of erectile function that persists depends largely on the nature, location and extent of the spinal lesion. Other disorders at the spinal level (e.g., spina bifida, disc herniation, syringomyelia, tumor and multiple sclerosis) may affect the afferent and efferent neural pathways in a similar manner.",

      "title": "Phenomenology and psychiatric origin of psychogenic nonepileptic seizures",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Psychogenic nonepileptic seizure (PNES) is a sudden change in a person's behavior, perception, thinking, or feeling that is usually time limited and resembles, or is mistaken for, epilepsy but does not have the characteristic electroencephalographic (EEG) changes that accompanies a true epileptic seizure [1]. It is considered that PNES is a somatic manifestation of mental distress, in response to a psychological conflict or other Stressors [2]. A wide spectrum of clinical presentation includes syncope, generalized tonic-clonic seizure, simple and complex partial seizure, myoclonic seizure, frontal lobe seizures and status epilepticus [3]. Coexistence of epilepsy and PNES is seen in approximately 9% of cases [5]. Between 25-30% of patients referred to tertiary centers and initially diagnosed as refractory epilepsy were on further examination diagnosed as PNES [6,7]. In DSM-IV [12] PNES are usually categorized under conversion disorder with seizures or convulsions. However, psychiatric basis of PNES may be anxiousness (panic attack), somatization or factitious disorder, simulation, dissociative disorders and psychosis [1]. AIM The aim of the study was to establish clinical phenomenology and EEG characteristics as well as basic psychiatric disorder in patients with PNES. METHOD In a retrospective study covering the period from January 1st 1999 till April 31 st 2003, 24 patients (22 female, 2 male) treated at the Institute of Neurology in Belgrade were analyzed. PNES were defined as sudden change in behavior incoherent with epileptiform activity registered on EEG. Possible PNES were determined on the basis of history data and clinical examination during the attack but definitive confirmation was established only by the finding of no ictal EEG changes during typical seizure of each patient. Patients with coexisting epilepsy were included in the study, too. At least two standard EEG (range 2-6, median 4) were performed at the beginning of diagnostic evaluation. Demographic data, clinical presentation (apparent loss of consciousness, type of convulsion and associated clinical signs) and placebo-induced seizures (administration of saline near the cubital vein) with EEG or video-EEG monitoring were analyzed. Basic psychiatric disorder was classified according to DSM IV classification criteria. RESULTS Duration of PNES was 4.7 years (range from 2 months to 30 years). The time from onset to the diagnosis of PNES was 4.5 years. Epilepsy comorbidity was diagnosed in 9 patients (37.5%). The average time of use of antiepileptic drugs (AED) in the group of isolated PNES was 2.4 years and 20% of patients were treated with two or more AED. The vast majority of patients presented with bilateral convulsions (54.16%) with apparent loss of consciousness found in 91.6% of cases. Ictal iwury (16.7%), tongue bite (4.2%) and premonition of the seizure (17.4%) were uncommon. Variability in clinical presentation of seizures was found in over half of patients (57%). Psychological trigger could be determined in over 60% of patients. EEG findings in a group with isolated PNES suggesting the existence of epileptiform activity was found in one case. EEG monitoring of placebo-induced seizure was performed in 20 patients, of whom 19 (95%) showed typical habitual attack with no electroclinical correlate. In 70% of cases conversion disorder DSM-IV criteria were fulfilled. Somatization disorder and undifferentiated somatoform disorder were found in 3 patients. The diagnosis of factitious disorder was made in one case and only two patients were undiagnosed according to DSM-IV. DISCUSSION Average delay from onset to diagnosis of PNES in larger studies was estimated to be approximately 7 years [8]. Even though diagnostic delay in our study was shorter, organizational reasons for this could not be found. Longer duration of a typical attack (compared to the epileptic seizure), apparent loss of consciousness, bilateral convulsion behavior and significant clinical variability in absence of typical epileptic elements such as tongue bite and ictal iwury could be the main clinical manifestation of PNES. We found rare interictal abnormalities (6.7%) in the group with isolated PNES and significant percentage (77.7%) in patients with coexisting epilepsy which is coherent with other reports [8]. The latest could lead to prolonged delay in appropriate diagnosis and suitable treatment. Clear psychological trigger wasn't noted in whole group of patients (61 %). This, however, is not unusual since PNES represents a chronic disorder with repeated triggering that could lead to less significant role of the same psychological trigger in developed PNES. Even insufficiently resolved in ethical terms, placebo-induced procedure was of huge sensitivity. In clinical practice conversion disorder is hard to differ from malingering or implementation of secondary gain. One could make the conclusion only on the basis of detailed and careful estimation of the symptoms developing context Conversion disorder is more prevalent among women (from 2:1 to 10:1) [4, 13] but modest percentage of affected men could be explained only by limited sample in this study. CONCLUSION PNES is often replaced with epilepsy and in number of cases clinical differentiation is not easy. One should be acquainted with clinical presentation of PNES as well as its psychiatric origin in order to adequately recognize and treat the disorder.",

      "abstract": "Neurological involvement is a typical feature of several inherited metabolic diseases. The onset of signs and/or symptoms may appear as early as the first days of life or after an interval of normal or near-normal growth and development. Metabolic decomposition usually presents with a severe clinical phenotype, which include poor feeding, vomiting, lethargy, seizures, and loss of consciousness. This spectrum of manifestations is often fatal; however, severe neurological sequelae and/or regression of neurodevelopmental milestones can be the prominent signs in those who survive. Overall, treatable inborn errors of metabolism can be divided in three groups, namely: (Group 1) inborn errors of intermediary metabolism giving rise to acute or chronic intoxication; (Group 2) inborn errors of intermediary metabolism affect in genergetic processes; and (Group 3) inborn errors involving cellular organelles, including lysosomal, peroxisomal, glycosylation, and cholesterol synthesis defects. The spectrum of neurological manifestations includes developmental delay, seizures and epilepsy, pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs, movement disorders, vision and hearing impairment, peripheral neuropathy, and psychiatric abnormalities. The main anatomical/imaging patterns reflects selective vulnerability of nervous system substance and include atrophy, (predominantly) symmetrical abnormalities, and dysmyelination, As several patients with neurometabolic diseases responds favorably to therapeutic trials, early detection and early intervention is of utmost importance to prevent catabolic-related damage and to revert to normal or near-normal parameters neurodevelopmental milestones.",

      "abstract": "Neurogenic positional pedal neuritis is a presentation of neuritic symptoms in one or both feet usually affected by body position, specifically, the position of the spine. Its etiology is similar to that of neurogenic-induced claudication caused by spinal stenosis in that the symptoms are caused by compression or irritation of nerves of the lower lumbosacral spine, usually the fifth lumbar and first sacral nerve roots. Burning, stabbing, a cold feeling, aching, numbness, paresthesia, or a weak or tired feeling of the feet (during some part of the disease process) depend on spinal position and may occur during standing, walking, or even lying in bed. Symptoms may be severe and are often eliminated by lumbosacral spine flexion, such as by walking with wheeled support such as a grocery cart or walker; less frequently by negative-heel shoe modification, which can change the position of the lumbosacral spine in stance; or by alteration of sleeping position. This condition, which can include loss of protective sensation, is often misdiagnosed as neuropathy (especially in diabetic patients) or less frequently as biomechanical in origin. In diabetic patients, this condition is frequently the cause of failure of monochromatic infrared energy therapy for diabetic peripheral neuropathy. Treatment is aimed at reducing the spinal nerve or nerve root irritation. Clear definition of the pedal symptoms of spinal nerve compression within a single diagnostic category should facilitate identification and treatment. (J Am Podiatr Med Assoc 93(3): 174-184, 2003)",

Reports from clinics and emergency rooms are pointing to the increase in incidence. However, there are very few studies from India. Many of the people presenting with acts of self-harm do not have suicidal intent, and this has prompted the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5)[1] to propose a category of Nonsuicidal Self-Injury (NSSI) as a “Condition for Further Study” to encourage further research in this area. DSM-5 Proposed Criteria for NSSI requires an individual to engage in intentional self-inflicted damage to the surface of his/her body, on 5 or more days in the last 1 year, with the expectation that the injury will lead to only mild or moderate physical harm.

According to the underlying physiological mechanism, myoclonic spasms can be classified as cortical, subcortical, spinal or peripheral. Myoclonic spasms appear in a wide range of neurological diseases. So-called symptomatic myoclonus is the type that occurs secondary to an identifiable disorder; it is usually accompanied by other neurological signs and is the most frequent kind. Epileptic myoclonus is that which forms part of an epileptic syndrome with a genetic or idiopathic cause, or that is due to static encephalopathy. Essential myoclonus is the least frequent type and includes palatal myoclonus and dystonia-myoclonus syndrome. The main therapeutic objective consists in treating the underlying cause of the myoclonus if possible and in using symptomatic treatment when this is not the case. Antiepileptic drugs that enhance the effect of gamma-aminobutyric acid are still the most effective medication. Among the non-antiepileptic drugs, piracetam and 5-hydroxytryptophan stand out above the rest. Botulinum toxin has proved to be effective in palatal myoclonus. In dystonia-myoclonus syndrome, research has been conducted on the effectiveness of deep brain stimulation on the internal globus pallidus. In the most severe forms of myoclonus, monotherapy is not usually effective.Progress has been made in furthering our knowledge of the neurophysiology of myoclonus, although no very effective forms of treatment have been reported for this motor disorder, which can be extremely disabling.",

The prevailing notion is that chronic stress promotes adverse outcomes on brain and body health, whereas acute stressors are generally benign. Notably, acute events such mass shootings or natural disasters are now emerging as significant sources of cognitive and emotional problems including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). These events are characterized by the simultaneous occurrence of physical, emotional, and social stresses, which last minutes to hours. Hence, there is a need to model such multiple concurrent acute stresses (MAS) to uncover the mechanisms by which they lead to profound adverse outcomes. The MAS paradigm described here involves simultaneously exposing a rodent to several different stressors including restraint, crowding, and jostling alongside peers in a brightly lit and very noisy environment. Moreover, the MAS paradigm can be used once or imposed repeatedly to emulate complex, repeated modern life stresses, advancing our mechanistic understanding of consequent mental and cognitive impairments.",

RAPOPOPiT* and ALAN FISKEf Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic psychiatric disease in which thoughts and habits run wild. Obsessive thoughts such as unreasonable doubts (am I a bad person? did I lock the door? do I have AIDS? did I harm someone?) or compulsive habits (praying, repeating, ordering, checking, cleaning, or washing) consume hours of the patients' time [I]. Typically, sufferers are aware that these symptoms are \"crazy\" but cannot control them. The ritualistic nature of OCD symptoms is striking. Repetitive counting or washing is accompanied by a sense that these behaviors are necessary to ward off discomfort or danger. Some OCD patients have commented on the similarity between their new and peculiar thoughts and behaviors and religious rituals or magical practices of other cultures. If the epidemiological studies are correct, as many as 2 million people in the United States have this disorder [2]. Until recently, most sufferers kept their disorder secret because of the embarrassment over the bizarre and irrational nature of their thoughts and rituals. The public awareness of the probable neurological nature of the disorder and the availability of effective treatments has increased recognition and referral of OCD patients .

Diverse lines of evidence indicate that dysfunction of cortical-basal ganglia circuitry underlies OCD. This raises important questions about the evolutionary basis for neural control of these behaviors. The existence of such specificity in the \"hard wiring \" of human behaviors as basic to everyday functions as cleaning, checking , and ordering, or concern about dangers to self or others, suggests a biological basis for universal categories of certain thoughts and rituals. The notion of psychiatric disorder asjust another part of medical biology is nothing new. However, some of the symptoms ofOCD—such as excessive prayer, ordering and counting, over-scrupulous concern about acceptable behavior, pollution, and purity, and rituals resembling imitative magic— are generally assumed to be culturally mediated and not thought to be so closely tied to specific brain circuitry. If there is a strong biological component , then the identity of these categories, their breadth, and how their mediating circuitry came to exist are exciting and researchable questions. The debates over such conceptualizations extend beyond psychiatry and medicine to touch linguistics, psychology, anthropology, and evolutionary biology. The recent advances in the neurobiology ofOCD, with converging evidence from genetics, brain imaging, immunology, and epidemiology, now suggest empirical research on the universality of fundamental types of human action, and on the joint role of biology and culture in shaping such complex actions. This paper will review recent biological and anthropological studies of OCD in order to suggest ways in which the study of disease may illuminate some fundamental issues in the social and behavioral sciences. Biological Research on Obsessive Compulsive Disorder PHARMACOLOGY The new look at OCD began with studies showing that clomipramine, a tricyclic drug with average antidepressant and antianxiety effects, had unique efficacy in treating OCD [3, 4] . This medication, and the four others to date that are equally effective anti-obsessional treatments, have in common their ability to block the reuptake of serotonin by brain neurons, with relatively little effect on norepinephrine reuptake. More recently, more selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors have become the drugs of choice for this disorder because a large percent of patients can tolerate their side effects [5] . The efficacy of these serotonergic drugs (and lack of efficacy of antidepressants that block reuptake of norepinephrine) inspired a \"serotonin hypothesis\" of OCD [6]. However, the...",

The presence of “motor impersistence” is typical of chorea. Sometimes patients can also make unintentional sounds referred to as hyperkinetic dysarthria. Chorea disappears during sleep. Ballism is considered a type of chorea with a more proximal distribution and larger movements. Athetosis is a term formally used for chorea with slow writing movements in the distal limbs, but it is not considered a specific entity of chorea anymore. The most important genetic cause of chorea in adulthood is Huntington’s disease, and genetic testing should be considered as a first step in all patients with adult-onset chorea if no secondary cause is found.",

      "abstract": "Concussive force can cause neurocognitive and neurobehavioral dysfunction by inducing functional, electrophysiological, and/or ultrastructural changes within the brain. Although concussion-triggered symptoms typically subside within days to weeks in most people, in 15%–20% of the cases, symptomology can continue beyond this time point. Problems with memory, attention, processing speed, and cognitive flexibility (e.g., problem solving, conflict resolution) are some of the prominent post-concussive cognitive symptoms. Repeated concussions (with loss or altered consciousness), which are common to many contact sports, can exacerbate these symptoms. The pathophysiology of repeated concussions is not well understood, nor is an effective treatment available. In order to facilitate drug discovery to treat post-concussive symptoms (PCSs), there is a need to determine if animal models of repeated mild closed head injury (mCHI) can mimic the neurocognitive and histopathological consequences of repeated concussions. To this end, we employed a controlled cortical impact (CCI) device to deliver a mCHI directly to the skull of mice daily for 4 days, and examined the ensuing neurological and neurocognitive functions using beam balance, foot-fault, an abbreviated Morris water maze test, context discrimination, and active place avoidance tasks. Repeated mCHI exacerbated vestibulomotor, motor, short-term memory and conflict learning impairments as compared to a single mCHI. Learning and memory impairments were still observed in repeated mCHI mice when tested 3 months post-injury. Repeated mCHI also reduced cerebral perfusion, prolonged the inflammatory response, and in some animals, caused hippocampal neuronal loss. Our results show that repeated mCHI can reproduce some of the deficits seen after repeated concussions in humans and may be suitable for drug discovery studies and translational research.",

It is characterised by marked anterior curvature or angulation of the cervical spine and is associated with various neuromuscular (table 1) and extrapyramidal disorders.12–15 Camptocormia or the bent spine syndrome was first described in hysterical soldiers in 1915 by the French neurologist Souques.16 Typically there is marked anterior curvature of the thoracolumbar spine. In some patients the spine is angulated forward, the arms propped against the thigh for support. More cases, all among soldiers, were reported during the first and second world wars. These patients responded well to psychotherapy. Recently camptocormia arising as a result of weakness or abnormality in the tone of the paraspinal muscles has been described (table 2). In contrast with other skeletal disorders of the spine such as kyphosis, the deformity in head ptosis and camptocormia is not fixed and is corrected by passive extension or lying in the supine position. It is not possible to straighten the neck or back voluntarily. The evaluation of these disorders can indeed be challenging and often no definite diagnosis is made, as illustrated by four cases of head ptosis and camptocormia seen by us at the Johns Hopkins Hospital.\n\nView this table:\n\n Table 1 \nNeuromuscular causes for head ptosis\n\n\n\nView this table:\n\n Table 2 \nCauses of camptocormia\n\n\n\nAn 80 year old man developed head ptosis insidiously over a period of few weeks.

      "title": "Genetics of Suicidal Behavior",
      "abstract": "Suicidal behavior is a global public health problem. Patients with different psychiatric disorders, such as alcohol and substance use disorders, depression, bipolar affective disorder, schizophrenia, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), personality disorders and altered behaviours frequently have suicidal thoughts, ideas and frequently develop suicidal behavior. However, there are a lot of psychiatric patients who do not have suicidal thoughts or suicidal ideation, who do not display suicidal behavior, and who never attempt suicide. Suicide is believed to be a multi-determined act, precipitated by a complex interplay of different socio-cultural factors, biological factors, traumatic events, a history of psychiatric disorders and particular personality traits. Neurobiological basis of suicidal behavior is not completely understood, however, the disturbances in the function of the major neuroendocrine and neurotransmitter systems, such as the hypothalamicpituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, serotonin, noradrenalin, dopamine, gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA), glutamate, endogenous opioids, and plasma cholesterol status, are assumed to be responsible for the development of suicidal behavior. The evidence from the literature suggests that genetic factors play an important role in the predisposition to suicidal behavior. Therefore, the data from the family, twin, and adoption studies all point to a genetic predisposition to suicide and suicidal behavior. Genetic studies are focused on the search for the candidate genes related to suicide and suicidal behavior. The most frequently investigated genes are the genes related to serotonin, noradrenalin and dopamine transporters, receptors and enzymes involved in the synthesis and degradation of these neurotransmitters, genes related to glutamatergic system, GABA and to neurotrophic factors and genes related to neuroendocrine system. However, despite the numerous studies showing the association of particular genes and suicidal behavior, the genetic risk factors for suicidal behavior, such as susceptibility genes that contribute to suicidal behavior, are still not yet confirmed, and there are a lot of non-replication in these results. Since the transmission patterns of suicidal behavior is complex, involving both environmental and genetic factors, precipitated by the complex interactions of the multiple genes, multiple alleles are implicated in the development of suicidal behavior. Therefore, more studies are needed to fully understand the genetic basis of suicidal behavior. The search for the genetic risk factors of suicidal behavior is an important task in the studies of the genetic susceptibility to suicide, since these studies might help in identifying subjects prone to develop suicidal behavior, who might attempt and/or complete suicide. These subjects might be properly treated and suicidal behavior might be prevented, in order to decrease the suicide rate. Therefore, an important goal in psychiatry is to evaluate the risk factors of suicidal behavior, in order to prevent suicidal behavior, to early identify the individuals prone to attempt suicide, to use the best possible treatment strategies to save lifes and to prevent suicidal attempts and suicide.",

Over the course of development, above-average facility in single-word reading and spelling and below-average skills in mechanical arithmetic are evident. Extreme difficulties in dealing with novel and otherwise complex material are especially apparent. Automatic, rote language skills become increasingly well developed and socio-emotional disturbances of the internalized variety become increasingly more apparent with advancing years. These and other developmental manisfestations of the NLD syndrome are examined within the context of several types of neurological disease/developmental disabilities, including cranio-cerebral trauma, hydrocephalus, and autism, and are related to a developmental model (Rourke, 1987) designed to encompass these manifestations.",

Traditionally, the dissociative disorders have been attributed to trauma and other psychological stress, but the existing evidence favoring this hypothesis is plagued by poor methodology. Prospective studies of traumatized individuals reveal no convincing cases of amnesia not attributable to brain insult, injury, or disease. Treatment generally involves recovering and working through ostensibly repressed or dissociated memories of trauma; at present, there are few quantitative or controlled outcome studies. Experimental studies are few in number and have focused largely on state-dependent and implicit memory. Depersonalization disorder may be in line for the next \"epidemic\" of dissociation.",

      "title": "Balance and Vertigo in Children",
      "abstract": "Balance is a motor function that enables a person to control coordinated movements. Any dysfunction of the neuroaxis that commands this control results in a disturbance of balance, leading to symptoms of dizziness. Vertigo is included under the subcategory of dizziness.The definition of vertigo is a sensation of movement that may be rotational or moving forward and can include tilting. Vertigo may result from abnormalities of the labyrinth system or the central nervous system that spans from the vestibular nerve to the brainstem and cerebellum. As with any dysfunction, the key to correct diagnosis is performing a complete history, physical examination, and further testing based on clinical indications.Obtaining an accurate history in young children may be difficult because they may not have the vocabulary to describe the sensation of vertigo. However, some authors suggest using playground terms such as \"spinning, swinging, sliding, or being on the merry-go-round.\" Symptoms associated with vertigo include nausea, vomiting, pallor, and perspiration but not loss of consciousness. Additional historical questions should address head trauma, fever, infections, and family history of vertigo or migraines.The physical examination focuses on evaluation of the external and middle ear; ophthalmologic assessment for signs of nystagmus; and neurologic examination of the cranial nerves, cerebellar function, and gait. Additional testing to consider includes hearing testing and audiometry. Brain imaging, such as magnetic resonance imaging, is only needed if the history and physical findings suggest an intracranial process.The most common cause of vertigo in children is middle ear disease, which may lead to balance disorders in walking. The external and middle ears should be examined for evidence of effusion, acute otitis media, or malformations such as cholesteatoma or perilymphatic fistula. Perilymphatic fistula may follow minor head trauma, resulting from a rupture of the round or oval window of the middle ear into the vestibule, creating a fistula. Symptoms from middle ear disease tend to improve after appropriate medical treatment. These diseases are very familiar to pediatricians and can easily be diagnosed by otoscopic examination.It is more challenging to develop a differential diagnosis of vertigo in children who have normal tympanic membranes. Potential causes include:After middle ear disease, BPV is the most common cause of vertigo in children. The age of onset ranges between 2 and 12 years, with an average age of onset of 6 years. The condition is more common in females and typically presents as a sudden onset of vertigo that last seconds to minutes, with complete resolution of symptoms between episodes. The attack is not induced by head movements or positional changes. Associated symptoms may include nausea and vomiting, and abnormal eye movements such as nystagmus may be present, but there are no neurologic changes or altered state of consciousness. The diagnosis is based on the brevity of the symptoms, presence of nystagmus during the episodes, symptom-free intervals, and frequently a family history of migraines. BPV is included among the periodic syndromes of childhood and may be considered a migraine equivalent. The prognosis is good and the symptoms disappear spontaneously before adolescence, although a subset of patients may develop migraines in the future. Migraines must also be considered as a potential cause of vertigo.Vestibular neuritis is caused by viruses such as herpes simplex, varicella-zoster, and influenza. Symptoms of nausea and vomiting develop suddenly and may persist for weeks.Head trauma with or without temporal bone fracture can cause labyrinthine concussion. Affected patients develop symptoms immediately after the trauma. The child is unsteady and tends to fall toward the affected side. The symptoms usually improve after 4 to 6 weeks.Ménière disease is another consideration when evaluating vertigo. Although rare in children, the prevalence ranges from 1.5% to 4% among children in whom vertigo is diagnosed, and cases have been described as young as 4 years of age. The key symptoms are tinnitus, vertigo, and progressive hearing loss.Cerebellar and brainstem tumors are rare causes of vertigo. Associated findings include headache, emesis, gait disturbance, and papilledema. Brain imaging is indicated.Treatment of vertigo depends on the cause and duration of symptoms. For acute symptoms that resolve quickly, reassurance may be all that is needed. Medications to suppress symptoms include promethazine and diazepam. Persistent severe nausea or vomiting can be treated with antiemetics such as metoclopramide or prochlorperazine. If the vertigo becomes chronic or recurrent, clonazepam or carbamazepine may be indicated. Symptoms of anxiety, panic attacks, and depression may present as a result of prolonged vertigo and should be treated accordingly.Comment: Vertigo can be challenging to diagnose, especially in young children. Pediatricians need to be aware that the causes of vertigo in children differ from those in adults. Vertigo may be diagnosed infrequently in young children because symptoms may be incorrectly attributed to their developmental status and lack of coordination rather than to a balance dysfunction, and young children may have difficulty describing their symptoms. Pediatricians must be skilled in differentiating the common causes of vertigo, such as middle ear disease, which is easily treated, and BPV, which resolves, from rarer but more serious conditions that may be progressive and require more thorough testing and imaging.Janet R.

      "abstract": "Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) is an autoimmune neurological disease, where the immune system attacks the myelin sheath of the central nervous system, causing inflammation that impairs the transmission of nerve impulses. It is characterized by episodes of flare-ups with exacerbation of symptoms, such as fatigue, weakness in the lower and upper limbs, tremors and balance, difficulty walking, loss of vision, among others, followed by remissions with partial or complete recovery, which can last for months or years, during which the progression of the disease is minimal or absent. Insomnia or poor sleep quality can occur indirectly as a consequence of RRMS. That is, a secondary symptom that is caused by the presence of the specific symptoms of the disease and pseudo-outbreaks. Body Perception (PC) can be defined in two ways, such as Body Image (CI) and Body Schema (CE). HF is related to the psychic, emotional, cognitive, sociocultural, evolutionary, genetic and neuroscientific aspects, in relation to the expectation of the image of their body. The CS is the perspective that enables, through kinesthetic and proprioceptive mechanisms, the recognition of the anatomical body and the relationship it establishes with the environment and with the objects around it. In view of these definitions, the opportunity arose to relate sleep quality with body perception and symptomatological conditions. Thus, the objective of the study was to analyze the relationship between sleep quality and body perception, by the aspect of body schema and the symptomatological conditions of multiple sclerosis. Participants were 18 people, aged between 21 and 67 years, who were evaluated for sleep quality using the Pittsburgh questionnaire, body perception using the Askevold test, and symptoms through a structured interview. The results indicated that all participants with adequate sleep were classified as hyperschematic, while 67% of those who had inadequate sleep were classified as hyposchematic. In addition, individuals with inadequate sleep showed a balanced distribution between motor and sensory symptoms, while those with adequate sleep predominantly reported sensory symptoms. Fatigue was a relevant symptom in 67% of individuals with inadequate sleep. These findings suggest that sleep quality may be associated with body perception and symptom manifestation in RRMS, highlighting the importance of sleep-enhancing interventions for the management of this condition.",

      "title": "Hereditäre Bewegungsstörungen",
      "abstract": "Hereditary movement disorders are characterized primarily by progressive motor deterioration. Dystonia is characterized by sustained or intermittent muscle contractions causing abnormal, often repetitive, movements, postures, or both. Dystonia can be classified according to age of onset, body distribution, temporal pattern, and associated features. Dystonia can occur in many different diseases. Of late, insights into the etiological background have increased considerably. There have also been advances in medical and surgical treatment. Ataxia can be a symptom of many neurometabolic and neurodegenerative diseases. This chapter discusses hereditary diseases with ataxia as their main symptom, possibly combined with “plus” symptoms in other neurological systems. The most frequent ataxias beginning in childhood are autosomal recessively inherited, namely Friedreich's ataxia, spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay and ataxia teleangiectasia. Some of the dominant spinocerebellar ataxias can also begin in childhood or adolescent age. This chapter discusses therapeutic attempts including experimental drug therapy and symptomatic physiotherapy. The group of hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSP) comprises different genetic diseases which have in common a slowly progressive spastic paresis of the legs with sparing of the upper extremities. “Pure” HSPs are differentiated from “complex” HSPs which show additional signs such as mental retardation, optic atrophy, neuropathy or dysmorphic features. Treatment is mainly symptomatic, only in SPG11 neurotransmitter treatment is under discussion. Hereditäre Bewegungsstörungen umfassen ein Spektrum neurologischer Erkrankungen, die in erster Linie durch progrediente motorische Störungen charakterisiert sind. Dystonie ist durch dauerhafte oder intermittierende Kokontraktionen von Agonisten und Antagonisten charakterisiert. Ätiologisch erfolgt eine Unterteilung in erworbene und genetische Formen. Zusätzlich wird eine Einteilung nach dem Erkrankungsbeginn, der anatomischen Verteilung, zeitlichem Verlauf, zusätzlichen Charakteristika und assoziierten Zeichen vorgenommen. In den letzten Jahren sind die ätiologischen Erkenntnisse, aber auch die medikamentösen und operativen therapeutischen Möglichkeiten sehr gewachsen. Ataxie kann ein Teilsymptom zahlreicher neurometabolischer und neurodegenerativer Erkrankungen sein. Die häufigsten genetischen Ataxien mit Manifestation im Kindesalter sind die autosomal-rezessiv vererbte Friedreich-Ataxie, spastische Ataxie Charlevoix-Saguenay und Ataxia teleangiectasia. Auch einige der dominant erblichen spinozerebellären Ataxien können bereits in der Jugend beginnen. Das Kapitel diskutiert medikamentöse Therapieansätze und effektive Physiotherapiekonzepte. Die Gruppe der hereditären spastischen Paraplegien (HSP) beinhaltet verschiedene genetische Erkrankungen, deren gemeinsames Leitsymptom eine langsam progrediente spastische Paraplegie unter weitgehender Aussparung der oberen Extremitäten ist. „Reine“ HSP werden von „komplexen“ HSP unterschieden, die zusätzlich durch Optikusatrophie, Neuropathie, mentale Retardierung oder dysmorphe Stigmata gekennzeichnet sind. Die Therapie erfolgt überwiegend symptomatisch, lediglich bei SPG11 wird eine Behandlung mit Neurotransmittern diskutiert.",

      "abstract": "Anxiety and psychosomatic Desease. Escalation mechanisms and therapeutic strategies from the perspective of systems theory and behavioral therapy Abstract. There is unlikely to be a symptomatic malady or disease in humans that is not accompanied by more or less severe anxiety. This can directly negatively influence bodily disease processes, it always creates or intensifies mental suffering, often it causes the development of an independent anxiety disorder. Pathogenetically, nonlinear amplifications play a central role, as they are typical for complex dynamic systems. While these multiple vicious cycle mechanisms are responsible for the escalation of symptoms, misdirected learning processes bring about a chronification. An integrative model for these pathogenetic relationships is being developed, which at the same time makes it clear how one can synergistically combine established behavioral therapy methods for their treatment. This integrative behavioral therapy is exemplified by a case study.Zusammenfassung. Es dürfte kaum eine symptomatische Funktionsstörung oder Erkrankung geben, die beim Menschen nicht von mehr oder weniger starker Angst begleitet wird. Dies kann körperliche Krankheitsprozesse direkt negativ beeinflussen, immer erzeugt bzw. intensiviert es psychisches Leiden, oft verselbständigt es sich zu einer eigenständigen Angsterkrankung. Pathogenetisch spielen nichtlineare Verstärkungen eine zentrale Rolle, wie sie für Komplexe dynamische Systeme typisch sind. Während diese vielfältigen Teufelskreis-Mechanismen für die Eskalation der Symptome verantwortlich sind, bewirken fehlgeleitete Lernprozesse eine Chronifzierung. Es wird ein Integrierendes Modell für diese pathogenetischen Zusammenhänge entwickelt, das zugleich deutlich macht, wie man etablierte verhaltenstherapeutische Methoden zu ihrer Behandlung synergistisch kombinieren kann. Diese verfahrensintegrierende Verhaltenstherapie wird an einem Fallbeispiel exemplifiziert.",

The latter include improved psychophysiological control as well as enhanced performance in controlled parapsychological experiments. Multiple studies on meditation, hypnosis, sensory homogenization, psychoactive drug ingestion, and spontaneous alterations of consciousness have demonstrated enhanced physiological (e.g., gastrointestinal and other somatic systems, heart rate and bleeding control, ability to withstand cold temperature and painful stimuli) and psychological (e.g., perceptual sensitivity, attention control and cognitive deautomatization, creativity, enhanced positive affect and personality change) functioning. Parapsychological (psi) research also indicates that when individuals are exposed to techniques to alter the state of consciousness such as sensory homogenization, meditation, hypnosis, and psychedelic drugs, they exhibit stronger evidence of psi functioning than when they are in ordinary waking consciousness, particularly if they are prone to having spontaneous alterations of consciousness and/or have had a mental practice for a long time. Recommendations for further development of research in this area are provided. (Less)",

      "abstract": "The rhythm of today's life is accelerated and many people do not pay attention to their own psychological state. The consequence of this is the accumulation of traumatic or stressful developments in people. Stress or trauma is interpreted as an event beyond normal human experience. One form of illness that is associated with this is post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD engages the affected person as a whole by acting on all aspects of person's development, that is, biological, psychological and social aspects. Biological plan includes the changes in the functioning of the nervous system, disruption of neurotransmitters such as cortisol, epinephrine, endorphins etc., which leads to changes in the mood and functions of our organism. In the psychological sphere, the victim manifests numerous symptoms, such as dissociation, learned helplessness, intrusive dreams and memories, emotional dullness, solitariness, depression, etc. In the social environment, especially in the family, large dysfunction occur. The victim unfavourably affects his or her environment, which at the same time represents, or at least it should represent, the supporting structure in overcoming the difficulties. The victims of PTSD live a difficult life in which each new day represents the beginning of a struggle with oneself. What is considered ordinary and normal, like self-control, sense of security or desire to discover new things, respresents a remarkable effort and hard work to the victims of PTSD. Cognitive-behavioral therapy is an efficient form of psychotherapy whose effectiveness is proven by numerous clinical studies in the treatments of various psychological disorders. Therefore, the importance of conduction of treatments in order to enable the ill persons to deal with the situation in the easiest possible way is incontestable. With family support, understanding environment, participating in therapies and pastoral models which are provided by the Church and which can be provided with spiritual-psychological assistance, the victim of the disorder can work on himself or herself and thus expect positive steps in dealing with the illness.",

Epilepsy is characterized by recurring episodes in which the electrical activity of many thousands of neurons becomes abnormally elevated and pathologically synchronized. This discharge interrupts normal brain function and leads, in some forms of epilepsy, to alterations in behavior (seizures). Seizures come in many varieties, ranging from brief, barely detectable losses of consciousness in what are called absence or petit mal epilepsies , to uncontrollable tonic‐clonic contractions of large muscle groups in the so‐called grand mal epilepsies . The behavioral manifestations and severity of the seizure reflect primarily the size and localization of the abnormal electrical discharge.",

      "title": "Mechanism of brain concussion, contusion and laceration",
      "abstract": "Injury to the head and intracranial structures may occur as a result of direct or indirect forces. An injury by a direct force occurs when an object strikes the head. Indirect injury to the head may take place when an object accelerates or decelerates the body, with injury to the head and contents occurring indirectly. The significance of direct and indirect types of injury lies in the fact that with direct injury, there is a greater likelihood of involvement of the head and contents only, whereas, in indirect injury to the head the entire body may be involved and the possibility of injury not only to the head but to other parts of the body as well is likely. As energy is absorbed by the head upon impact, the skull deforms and the head is either accelerated or decelerated. With regard to the production of injury the following may result. (a) There will be deformation of the skull with possible fracture or compression of the intracranial contents or both. This compression of the intracranial contents results from a decrease in the volume of the head due to deformation of the skull. (b) Sudden increase in intracranial pressure due to the acceleration or deceleration of the head at the time of impact; (c) mass movements of intracranial contents due to different acceleration rates of the skull and its contents; (d) distortion of the skull and dural septae as seen particularly in birth injuries; (e) shearing off a portion of the head without necessarily producing an appreciable increase in intracranial pressure; (f) shearing and tearing of intracranial contents due to greatly increased intracranial pressure as in bullet and shell fragment injuries; (g) a combination of any of these effects, (5). This last possibility is probably the most common mechanism as one or more of the above effects combine to cause the head injury in most cases. The injury to the head and intracranial contents occurs as a result of the following mechanisms: (a) There may be compression or squeezing of the tissues. (b) There may be tension or tearing apart of the tissues. (c) There may be shearing or sliding of the tissues over each other. These three mechanisms may operate simultaneously or in combination in different areas or in different directions in the same area. Concussion is a term describing a state of post-traumatic unconsciousness associated with pallor and a shock-like state in the human. It may be of varying intensity from completely recoverable states to those of continued coma and death. Concussion is caused by derangement of brain stem reticular formation. Open wounds of the head, contusions and lacerations of the brain may or may not be associated with concussion or such derangement. The mechanism of contusions and lacerations of the brain, electrical changes and chemical alterations after head injury are discussed and evaluated.",

The clinical manifestations of this broad group of disorders are quite varied. The dystonias may emerge at any age from infancy through late adulthood, they may affect muscles in nearly any region of the body, they may occur without other clinical problems, or they may be combined with other neurological or systemic disorders. There are many etiologies for dystonia, both acquired and inherited, although many are idiopathic. The clinical manifestations and causes are quite varied, but there are numerous well-recognized syndromes. Among adults, the most common syndromes affect a single body region such as the neck (cervical dystonia or torticollis), craniofacial region (blepharospasm or oromandibular dystonia), one limb (e.g., writer’s cramp or foot dystonia), the larynx (laryngeal dystonia or spasmodic dysphonia), or another region. For adults, most cases are idiopathic and a cause cannot be found despite extensive workup. For children, dystonia often spreads to involve a broader region of the body and a cause is more likely to be discovered. The most common syndromes among children include cerebral palsy or genetic disorders where dystonia may occur in isolation or combined with other clinical problems. This volume provides a comprehensive resource that addresses the many subtypes of dystonia and how they are diagnosed and treated.",

      "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury, an insult to the brain caused by an external force, a leading cause of mortality and disability worldwide, produces reduced or altered states of consciousness with or without impaired cognitive abilities or physical functioning. The magnitude, length, and persistence of TBI sequelae depend on the severity of the injury and the interplay of various pre-injury and post-injury factors. The consequences of TBI that may exhibit as physical, cognitive, emotional, and social not only have their impact on the patients' lives but also on their caregivers or family members and communities in terms of social participation. Though little can be done to reverse the initial traumatic insult due to primary brain injury, prompt and effective medical and/or neurosurgical management may aid to minimize the secondary injury consequences such as hypotension, hypoxia, or both. This chapter covers the etiology, clinical manifestations, investigations, medical and surgical management, and acute through chronic physiotherapy management of head injury.",

For most of these disorders, there is ongoing controversy about whether the movement disorder originates in the peripheral nervous system or whether peripheral injury is the trigger for a centrally generated disorder. In some cases, the involuntary movements fit easily within traditional movement categories such as dystonia, tremor, and myoclonus. There are other disorders, such as rare isolated dyskinesias, where the movements are not easily categorized and so do not comfortably fit in any of the other hyperkinetic movement categories. Since there are few common principles in these conditions, the chapter discusses them each separately.",

      "title": "Adolescent Bulimia Nervosa—Part 2: A Proposed Group Nursing Intervention",
      "abstract": "Bulimia nervosa (BN) is the most common eating disorder noted in the female adolescent and college-age population. BN develops like other self-destructive substance addictions and often runs a chronic and relapsing course. The potentially irrevocable effects, including death, of BN on the growth and development of adolescents emphasize the importance of providing appropriate nursing interventions for this population. This proposed nursing plan of care for female adolescent suffering with BN is guided by Roy's Adaptation Model and incorporates aspects of addiction, nutritional, cognitive-behavioral, relapse prevention, and family therapy techniques and models. This group plan was developed to provide a framework or foundation for nurses working with this population. Future practice and research recommendations are also presented. Bulimia nervosa (BN) develops like other self-destructive substance addictions. The bulimic behavior may begin with a specialized trigger (dieting-binging-purging), but the trigger tends to broaden gradually to encompass other emotional or social stimuli (e.g., feeling depressed or anxious). This results not only because of physiologic effects on the body, but also secondary to learned responses (Riley, 1991). The framework for this proposed nursing plan of care for adolescents suffering with BN, as described in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) (American Psychiatric Association, 1994), is guided by Roy's Adaptation Model (1984). This outpatient group plan incorporates many aspects of addiction, nutritional, cognitive-behavioral, relapse prevention, and family therapy techniques and models. The plan outlined in this article is offered as a foundation for nursing practice and research development. Within an addiction model, BN is viewed as a primary, chronic, and progressive illness from which individuals can be helped to physical, psychological, and spiritual recovery. Key to the addiction model is the disease concept. This concept defines BN as an involuntary, biopsychological state and lifts from the person the responsibility and guilt for the development of the disease, but emphasizes the need for responsible management of the problem once it exists. Because many bulimics are embarrassed by their inabilities to control food intake, the disease concept helps break through the denial surrounding the illness. Denial perpetuates the disease and associated feelings of depression, shame, and powerlessness (Riley, 1991). The group context provides a safe, supportive, and empathetic environment in which group members are guided to challenge each other's denial, magical thinking, and other cognitive and behavior mal-adaptations (Riley, 1991). Adolescents place special importance on what their peers think is acceptable, thereby learning that their problems, including bulimia, are not unique fosters sharing with less denial (Cramer-Azima, 1992). Finding out they are not alone produces a tremendous sense of relief and instills hope (Riley, 1991). Group therapists working with adolescents must be active in setting boundaries and rules, and initially are more directive. This directiveness should lessen as the group matures and its climate begins to favor self-closure and problem solving (Cramer-Azima, 1992). Therapists must also be aware of the potential for group members' sharing of maladaptive behaviors, such as purging methods and stealing techniques (Pilote, 1998). These behaviors should be immediately confronted within the group.",

      "abstract": "Secure attachments with caregivers play a critical role in helping children develop a capacity to modulate physiological arousal. Loss of ability to regulate the intensity of feelings and impulses is possibly the most far-reaching effect of trauma and neglect. It has been shown that most abused and neglected children develop disorganized attachment patterns. The inability to modulate emotions gives rise to a range of behaviors that are best understood as attempts at self-regulation. These include aggression against others, self-destructive behavior, eating disorders, and substance abuse. The capacity to regulate internal states affects both self-definition and one's attitude toward one's surroundings. Abused children often fail to develop the capacity to express specific and differentiated emotions: Their difficulty putting feelings into words interferes with flexible response strategies and promotes acting out. Usually, these behaviors coexist, which further complicates diagnosis and treatment. Affective dysregulation can be mitigated by safe attachments, secure meaning schemes, and pharmacological interventions that enhance the predictability of somatic responses to stress. The ability to create symbolic representations of terrifying experiences promotes taming of terror and desomatization of traumatic memories.",

      "title": "Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and Older Men: If Only Time Healed All Wounds",
      "abstract": "Trauma has been noted as hidden variable in lives of older adults that affects psychological, social, physiological, and behavioral functioning. Understandings of trauma have evolved considerably in more than two decades of research since initial entry of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in 1980 publication of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III). Originally a diagnostic category for war trauma primarily studied in Vietnam veterans, PTSD has been applied to individuals of all ages who have suffered a wide variety of both combat- and noncombat-related traumas. Thus effects of trauma in older populations have been acknowledged, but thorough research remains to be done. Currently FTSD is defined in Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV TR, 2000) as occurring after one experiences, witnesses, or confronts a traumatic event including actual or threatened death, serious injury, or a threat to bodily integrity of self or others that evokes fear, helplessness, or horror. Traumatic events include physical assault, natural or man-made disasters, combat, and captivity (Cook and O'Donnell, 2005). Symptoms of PTSD include re-experiencing (flashbacks or visceral responses), avoidance activities (such as drinking or drug use), and arousal or hypervigilance. FTSD is considered acute if symptoms last less than three months, and chronic if symptoms continue for more than three months. A BRIEF HISTORY OF PTSD The definition of PTSD has broadened since 1980, though diagnostic category is direct result of efforts of veterans of Vietnam War and psychologists to label and treat their experience (Scott, 1993). Combat-related FTSD was thought to be contemporary version of fatigue or shock, a psychological disintegration found to occur under stresses of combat. As carry as Civil War, some combatants reported to have had difficulty adjusting to stress of battle (Scott, 1993). The Surgeon General of Union Army described condition as nostalgia and recommended that such individuals should be retained in combat zone but reassigned to less stressful duties. However, nostalgia was not treated by psychiatric specialists until Russo-Japanese War (1904-1905), and it was not until World War I that military began planning for psychiatric casualties as an integral part of their support operations (Bourne, 1970). During World War I, soldiers' breakdowns thought to be related to proximity of exploding shells and thus labeled shell shock. Mental impairment was linked to an organic cause-shell explosions causing a concussion of brain. This organic model was called into question, though, by cases of among who had not been near explosions (Showalter, 1985). Such cases summarily written offas outright cowardice or lack of moral fiber and considered (Bourne, 1970, p. II). During this war, treatments for shell shock and emotional shock differed dramatically. Those deemed emotionally shocked were kept near forward medical units and treated with painful electric shocks, threats of imprisonment and even execution while shell-shocked soldiers were evacuated to medical facilities further to rear (Bourne, 1970, p. 12). Treatment for emotional shock was perceived to be highly effective, with a majority of patients returning to combat, while shell-shocked patients had a lower rate of recovery, which was thought to be result of organic nature of their problems. Later systematic clinical tests concluded that there was not an organic component to shell shock (Showalter, 1985). Gradually, psychiatric community came to conclusion that the emotional stress of prolonged exposure to violent death was sufficient to produce a neurotic syndrome resembling hysteria in men (Herman, 1992, p. …",

      "title": "Baby Jerking: A Teaching Video‐Recorded Case of Febrile Myoclonus",
      "abstract": "Myoclonus was first described by Friedreich in 1881: It is a sudden, brief, shock-like involuntary movement caused by muscle contraction (positive myoclonus) or atonia (negative myoclonus), often called \"jerk,\" \"shake,\" or \"spasm\" by patients and inexpert observers. Depending on the distribution, myoclonus can be focal, multifocal, segmental, or generalized. Myoclonic jerks can be isolated or in cluster, rhythmic or arrhythmic, occur at rest (spontaneous), be triggered by stimuli (reflex), or induced by voluntary movement (action).1 Marsden et al. first classified myoclonus in four categories on the base of clinical presentation and aetiology: physiological, essential, epileptic, and symptomatic myoclonus. Alternatively, neurophysiological features associated with the neuroanatomical source of myoclonus can be used to differentiate cortical, cortical-subcortical, subcortical-nonsegmental, segmental, and peripheral myoclonus.1 Febrile myoclonus (FM) was described for the first time in 1960,2 but its importance has increased only in the recent decades. FM is a benign disorder characterized by the appearance of myoclonic jerks during fever, with resolution of myoclonus upon defervescence. Sometimes, similar myoclonic jerks can occur also after an infectious event, and for these cases the more appropriate term of \"parainfectious myoclonic jerks\" has been introduced by Bathia et al.3 and recently recovered by Delucchi et al.4 In most cases, FM occurs in the same age range as febrile seizures (6 months–6 years). Only a few cases of FM are reported in the literature.5-8 All researchers agree that this condition is relatively frequent, but under-recognized. We add a new case of FM to the pertinent literature and report, for the first time, on a video showing FM attacks in order to improve the knowledge about this disorder among child neurologists and pediatricians and facilitate its recognition. An 11-month-old boy was brought to our emergency room by his parents because of the abrupt appearance of sudden, brief body jerks occurring every 3 to 4 minutes throughout the previous hour. His family history was negative for movement disorders and seizures, and the child presented a normal neurological development and had no past history of neurological illness. The child had a cold for the previous 2 days and a fever for the preceding 12 hours. At admission, his body temperature was 39.6°C. The clinical and neurological examination was normal, except for upper airway inflammation. There were no signs of meningeal irritation. During the observation, the child was sitting with extended lower limbs. Repetitive abrupt, brief jerks involving the four limbs were observed, with violent extension and sometimes abduction of the limbs, occasionally associated with axial retropulsion. Sometimes the jerks occurred in a cluster, with a bigger initial jerk, possibly more tonic, followed by close rhythmic jerks with fading intensity. There were no obvious triggers, such as sudden noises, or tactile or painful stimuli. If holding an object at the onset of an episode, the boy would fist his hand, whereas he would open and extend it if free, suggesting a prevalent proximal involvement. The child looked alert, but frightened, during the events, and cried afterward (see Video 1; written informed consent was obtained from the patient's parents for the publication of this video). The child was admitted to the pediatric neurology department for further investigations. Routine blood tests revealed mild neutrophilic leukocytosis and the urine test was negative, suggesting an upper respiratory tract infection (URTI). During hospitalization, he experienced two other brief clusters of two to three jerks during wakefulness as well as during sleep, respectively, with a body temperature of 37.5°C and 38.6°C. After administration of ibuprofen, body temperature dropped and myoclonic jerks completely disappeared. A 24-hour video EEG monitoring performed subsequently showed normal background activity in wakefulness and sleep without any epileptic abnormalities and discharges. No episodes were recorded. The URTI did not require antibiotic therapy, and the baby fully recovered within 2 days with antipyretics. He has remained well over a 24-month follow-up: No neurological deficits, seizures, or psychomotor developmental delay have been observed. Therefore, on the basis of published descriptions of similar fits in infancy,2, 9 the diagnosis of FM was formulated. The clinical picture of our patient shows significant similarities to previously reported cases of FM.5-8The analysis of the video that we provide will possibly help the diagnosis of FM be easier and more straightforward to make for clinicians. Although the first 5 cases of myoclonus associated with fever were described in 1960,2 only 25 patients have been reported in the English literature thus far, none with video documentation of the spells.5-8 Most likely, FM occurs more frequently than reported, and, at presentation, its distinction from other conditions (such as Fejerman syndrome, epileptic spasms, epileptic myoclonus, or other symptomatic myoclonus9, 10) may be challenging for general pediatricians. As far as our patient is concerned, the absence of a history suggestive of remote or recent brain injury, along with the normal neurological development and exam, make the diagnosis of symptomatic myoclonus extremely unlikely.9 Moreover, the normal EEG background activity and the absence of photosensitivity, as well as jerks induced by tactile or acoustic stimuli, allow us to rule out also the diagnosis of epilepsy, such as benign myoclonic epilepsy of infancy and infantile spasms. Furthermore, the distinctive occurrence of myoclonic jerks only during fever makes the diagnosis of benign myoclonus of early infancy (Fejerman syndrome),9 shaking body attacks, or other paroxysmal nonepileptic phenomena11 unlikely; indeed, these conditions share some clinical aspects with FM, but have not been related to fever. The clinical features of FM may be summarized as follows: (1) sudden onset of generalized/segmental myoclonus; (2) presence of fever; (3) presentation between 6 months and 6 years of age; (4) nonprogressive course and absence of other additional signs or symptoms; (5) absence of possible causes for secondary myoclonus (hypoxia, metabolic disorders, drug intoxication, storage disease, or neurodegenerative disorders); (6) absence of central nervous system infection; and (7) recovery with cessation of the febrile event in a child with otherwise normal neurological development and physical examination. Even though the etiopathogenesis remains unknown,5, 8 the febrile myoclonic jerks in these children do not seem to be related to cortical epileptic discharges.5, 12 Some researchers suggest a brainstem origin of myoclonus.7 The diagnosis is based on careful clinical evaluation. Extensive investigations, such as brain MRI and lumbar puncture, are not necessary for this diagnosis; video EEG polygraphy recordings can be useful to show normal background activity and rule out the epileptic nature of the jerks; benign long-term outcome offers further support to the diagnosis of FM. No therapy is required. By publishing, for the first time, a suggestive video recording of FM, we draw attention to the importance of increasing the knowledge about this disorder among child neurologists and pediatricians, in order to facilitate its recognition, avoiding misdiagnosis and unwarranted treatment as well as allowing reassurance of parents and caregivers.

Objectives We report the case of a male patient aged 58 with multiple previous admissions for behavioral alteration symptoms, including exhibitionism. He is referred as irritable, uninhibited and sleeping disorders. There is a risk of flight as he is difficult to be held so it is feared that he can be run over by a car. He shows a marked self-referentiality. Methodology The patient is admitted. He properly gets used to the rules of the Ward. Pharmacological adjustment is performed. During his admittance he shows no behavior disorders neither episodes of self or hetero aggression and poor impulse. He properly makes comments of what happened during his stay. He responds well to treatment prescribed. Sleep pattern is restored. Results Schizophrenia (undifferentiated) 295.90 (F.20.3); intellectual disability mild 317 (F70); neurocognitive disorder (possible). Conclusions This is unusual case because it is normal that the sexual function of such patients is adversely affected, not finding numerous cases of disinhibition in our medical consultation. This is due to the different aspects that are affected, biological (drugs), psychological and social levels. We have different therapeutic alternatives to address this problem. However, they may hinder sociability and patient rehabilitation. Disclosure of interest The authors have not supplied their declaration of competing interest.",

      "abstract": "Tics are very common in children. They are often present for a limited period of time (transient tics) and typically remit or significantly improve before adulthood. The majority of people with tics do not seek medical attention. The prototypical tic disorder causing disability is Gilles de la Tourette syndrome (TS), a childhood-onset neuropsychiatric disorder predominantly characterized by fluctuating and persisting motor and phonic tics but also a wide array of complex symptoms, such as premonitory urges, echo- and coprophenomena, and a variety of comorbidities including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). The most conspicuous feature distinguishing TS from other movement disorders is preceding inner urges; hence, tics are often experienced as voluntary movements, performed to transiently relieve unpleasant premonitory sensations. A typical course in a TS patient would be the onset of motor tics around the age of 5; onset of vocal tics several months or a few years later, with a peak of symptoms between the ages of 8 and 12; and a marked decrease until early adulthood. Etiology is largely genetic with environmental factors probably playing a disease-modifying role. There is much overlap with OCD and ADHD both phenomenologically and genetically, but specific mutations have not been identified. Structural and functional differences in brain areas between TS patients and healthy controls predominantly point to a dysfunction of the basal ganglia (BG) with an imbalance in the dopaminergic system. In line with these findings, the most successful treatment options in TS encompass typical and atypical antipsychotics. Some patients also benefit from tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), botulinum toxin injections, or, rarely, deep brain stimulation. Behavioral treatment has also been promoted. However, tics wax and wane and naturally decrease in 80 % of TS patients after puberty. Moreover, patients commonly suffer more from comorbidities than from TS. Therefore, most patients do not require pharmacological treatment for tics but can benefit from psychoeducation.",

      "title": "Hereditary Transthyretin Amyloidosis",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Hereditary transthyretin (ATTR) amyloidosis is characterized by a slowly progressive peripheral sensorimotor and/or autonomic neuropathy as well as non-neuropathic changes of cardiomyopathy, nephropathy, vitreous opacities, and CNS amyloidosis. The disease usually begins in the third to fifth decade in persons from endemic foci in Portugal and Japan; onset is later in persons from other areas. Typically, sensory neuropathy starts in the lower extremities with paresthesias and hypesthesias of the feet, followed within a few years by motor neuropathy. In some persons, particularly those with early-onset disease, autonomic neuropathy is the first manifestation of the condition; findings can include: orthostatic hypotension, constipation alternating with diarrhea, attacks of nausea and vomiting, delayed gastric emptying, sexual impotence, anhidrosis, and urinary retention or incontinence. Cardiac amyloidosis is mainly characterized by progressive cardiomyopathy. Individuals with leptomeningeal amyloidosis may have the following CNS findings: dementia, psychosis, visual impairment, headache, seizures, motor paresis, ataxia, myelopathy, hydrocephalus, or intracranial hemorrhage. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of hereditary ATTR amyloidosis is established in a proband with characteristic clinical features, amyloid deposits identified on biopsy that bind to anti-TTR antibodies, and identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in TTR by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Therapeutic approach based on the characteristics of each therapy and the affected individual's severity of amyloidosis, general condition, and social environment. Pharmacotherapeutics (e.g., TTR tetramer stabilizers, gene-silencing therapies) are first-line therapy for all individuals with hereditary ATTR amyloidosis. Limited indication for orthotopic liver transplantation, which is highly invasive and does not address non-neuropathic forms of ATTR amyloidosis. Surgery indicated for carpal tunnel syndrome, vitrectomy for vitreous involvement, and surgical treatment for glaucoma. In those with sick sinus syndrome or second-degree or third-degree AV block, a cardiac pacemaker may be indicated. Surveillance: Serial nerve conduction studies to monitor polyneuropathy; serial electrocardiogram, echocardiography, and serum B-type natriuretic peptide levels to monitor cardiomyopathy and conduction block; follow modified body mass index to monitor nutritional status. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Local heating appliances, such as hot-water bottles, which can cause low-temperature burn injury in those with decreased temperature and pain perception. Evaluation of relatives at risk: If the family-specific pathogenic variant is known, molecular genetic testing ensures early diagnosis and treatment. If the familial variant is not known, clinical evaluations ensure early diagnosis and treatment. Genetic counseling Hereditary ATTR amyloidosis is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Each child of an affected individual (who is heterozygous for one TTR pathogenic variant) has a 50% chance of inheriting the TTR variant. For affected individuals homozygous for TTR pathogenic variants: Each sib is at a 50% risk of inheriting one TTR pathogenic variant and a 25% risk of inheriting two TTR pathogenic variants; All offspring will inherit a pathogenic variant. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible if the pathogenic variant has been identified in the family. Requests for prenatal testing for adult-onset conditions that (like hereditary ATTR amyloidosis) do not affect intellect and have some treatment available are not common.",

      "abstract": "There may be a strong underlying wish to return to primary narcissism, with accompanying hopelessness and unconscious shame. When shame is avoided, pathological narcissism, counterfeit behaviour, hostility or violence may result. A move by a patient into a merged state with the therapist may, therefore, signal anxiety due to the presence of unconscious shame. The way that the therapist deals with the projected shame may be crucial to the outcome of the therapy. The situation may become an intractable \"shame-guilt cycle\" in which there is a repetition-compulsion, without insight, of an unconscious sado-masochistic relationship in the transference and countertransference. Defences against shame are manifestations of a wish to hide from oneself or from the seeing other. Whatever the sequence of cause and effect, shame and sexuality are closely associated. Shame undoubtedly plays a part in many, if not all, psychological disturbances and may be the most important factor in some.",

These phobias concern the person in relation to the other, most frequently the mother’s relation towards her child. The behavior shows a narcissistic type whereas phobia is not projected on an external object. Its defensive role is then not effective. Withdrawal symptoms can act as a protection against oneself and the child, entailing disorders of the mother-child relationship. Three clinical situations are exposed, exemplary of these problems. Impulsion phobia can be contained within representation and psychic defense, especially in the neurotic organizations. But patients presenting narcissistic troubles present risks of acting out toward the child or themselves. The therapeutic work allows solving traumas and identical failures.",

Afecta al 1-2% de los ninos en edad escolar y es el trastorno de movimiento mas frecuente en edad pediatrica. Los tics son movimientos intermitentes, repetitivos, rapidos y estereotipados, precedidos de una sensacion premonitoria que impulsa al realizar el movimiento, se suprimen a voluntad y pueden persistir durante todas las fases del sueno. Frecuentemente se asocian a trastornos neuropsiquiatricos como los trastornos por deficit de atencion/hiperactividad y los trastornos obsesivo-compulsivos. Pueden simular casi cualquier trastorno del movimiento. Desarrollo. Se piensa que el origen de la enfermedad esta en una disfuncion de los ganglios basales, pero a dia de hoy no se conocen las causas geneticas o ambientales que la producen. El tratamiento se basa en terapias educacionales, farmacologicas e incluso quirurgicas en funcion del sintoma mas incapacitante. Los agonistas alfa2-adrenergicos y los neurolepticos son los farmacos de primera eleccion. Los neurolepticos deben administrarse con precaucion y en dosis bajas debido a sus potenciales efectos adversos. Conclusion. Es importante un tratamiento adecuado de cara a mejorar la calidad de vida y la funcion psicosocial de los pacientes afectados por esta enfermedad.",

First recorded by Itard in 1825, it was later fully described (1885) and followed up (1899) by Gilles de la Tourette, whose name has been given to the condition. Associated with the compulsive utterances are multiple motor tics, hence Convulsive Tic is a synonym for the malady. The motor movements are more severe and widespread than those met with in simple tic, and they may involve the whole body in a violent spasm. Facial grimaces, violent jerks of the head, limbs and trunk may occur, often combined with an explosive utterance. This exclamation may consist of an unorganized sound such as a bark or a groan or a grunt. Or it may be a word—frequently of an obscene nature (coprolalia) which greatly embarrasses the patient. Other features of the condition are echolalia—the impulse to repeat sounds or words which the patient hears, and echbpraxia—the compulsion to copy the actions of others.",

Consequences such as sexual and / or\r\n psychological abuse, participation in war operations, murders, heavy traffic accidents, natural\r\n disasters, sudden deaths of close relatives can be expressed immediately or developed into\r\n posttraumatic stress disorder. If he is a victim, he certainly wants to know what exactly happened\r\n to be able to take healing, recovery and return to normal life circumstances.\r\n Traumatic experience leaves a lasting mental, emotional, behavioral and physical\r\n consequence that the traumatized person wears on a daily basis.

Psycho-radiotherapy is distanced and alienated from its\r\n family, can not function normally in a working and family environment, and what is\r\n characteristic not only of a person suffering from illness but also of members of his family is a\r\n feeling of helplessness that occurs. Family members do not know how and how to help. There is\r\n a need to react in time and seek professional help.

A significant proportion is related to hypoxic–ischemic brain injury, either diffuse or focal (e.g., stroke). Neonatal brain injury is recognized clinically by a characteristic encephalopathy that evolves over days in the newborn period. This clinical syndrome includes a lack of alertness, poor tone, abnormal reflex function, poor feeding, compromised respiratory status, and seizures. Neonatal encephalopathy occurs in 1–6/1000 live term births, and is a major cause of neurodevelopmental disability. Up to 20% of affected infants die during the newborn period, and another 25% sustain permanent deficits of motor and also cognitive function. Functional motor deficits are often described as cerebral palsy, a non-progressive disorder of motor function or posture originating in early life. Cognitive deficits include mental retardation or learning disabilities, and impaired executive functions, language skills, or social ability. Other forms of neonatal brain injury, particularly in the term newborn, such as stroke, have an incidence as high as 1/4000 live births. More than 95% of infants with neonatal stroke survive to adulthood, and many have some form of motor or cognitive disability.",

      "title": "Managing Sports-related Concussions From Time of Injury Through Return to Play",
      "abstract": "Sports-related concussions continue to generate widespread interest. A concussion is a complex pathophysiologic process, with or without loss of consciousness, that results in a disturbance of brain function. Risk factors include age &lt;18 years, female sex, and history of a previous concussion. A sideline physical examination with standardized assessment tools can assist diagnosis. Management for suspected concussion begins with immediate removal from play and requires clinical follow-up. Symptoms are usually self-limited and resolve within 2 to 3 weeks. Initial treatment consists of a reduction in cognitive activity and physical rest. A stepwise return-to-play protocol, taking into consideration state laws, with a gradual increase in activity until the athlete is able to perform full activity without symptoms should be followed. Neuropsychologic testing may be used as a tool in management. For prolonged concussion, physical rehabilitation or medications for headaches, mood, or sleep disturbance may be required. Education, rule changes, and equipment improvements may assist in prevention. The long-term consequences of concussions are not fully understood and merit additional research.",

      "abstract": "3 Days In infants between the ages of 1 month and 1 year convulsions are usually associated with fever. If there is no fever, fits secondary to a structural brain abnormality, hypoglycaemia, and hypocalcaemia should be considered. Fits can be divided into generalised or partial seizures. Generalised seizures include tonic-clonic and myoclonic fits. Partial seizures include focal motor and temporal lobe fits. During some episodes partial seizures may be followed by generalised seizures. Generalised tonic-clonic fits are the most common type. The child may appear irritable or show other unusual behaviour for a few minutes before an attack. Sudden loss of consciousness occurs during the tonic phase, which lasts 20-30 seconds and is accompanied by temporary cessation of respiratory movements and central cyanosis. The clonic phase follows and there are jerky movements of the limbs and face. The movements gradually diminish and the child may sleep for a few minutes before w-aking confused and irritable. Although a typical tonic-clonic attack is easily recognised, other forms of fits may be difficult to diagnose from the mother's history. Infantile spasms may begin with momentary episodes of loss of tone, which can occur in bouts and be followed by fits in which the head may suddenly drop forward or the whole infant may move momentarily like a frog. Recurrent episodes with similar features, whether they are changes in the level of consciousness or involuntary movements, should raise the possibility of fits. Parents are very frightened by a fit and may fear that their infant is dying.",

In the elderly, it involves a rapid cognitive decline from the preexisting level of functioning (whatever that might be) involving conscious level, orientation, attention, memory and concentration. The mental state fluctuates from minute to minute or hour to hour, often worse in the evenings than mornings. There are perceptual abnormalities (illusions, hallucinations and misrecognition), affective changes (apathy, lability, irritability, autonomic arousal), persecutory or terrifying ideas, behavioral changes (hypokinesis or hyperkinesis), and motor features – ‘plucking’ and pointing are common. It is an unpleasant state with a high mortality and a high risk of adverse iatrogenic consequences. In approximately 85% of recognised cases, one or more physical causes can be identified, for example infection, intoxication with prescribed drugs, and cardiovascular, respiratory and metabolic disease. In the other 15%, psychologic factors such as removal from home, grief, depression or acute psychotic illness are sufficient to precipitate delirium. The risk of delirium appears to rise with age and underlying cerebral disease.",

      "title": "Force Maintenance With Submaximal Fatiguing Contractions",
      "abstract": "Whereas many definitions of fatigue include externally measurable decrements in force or performance, fatigue can be present with no change in the external output of the muscle. The maintenance of submaximal forces can be considered a compromise between neuromuscular force enhancement and competing inhibitory influences. An example of a muscle facilitatory process includes postactivation potentiation that results in an increased sensitivity to Ca ++ . The neuromuscular system copes with metabolic disruption and subsequent loss of force by recruiting additional motor units and increasing the firing frequency. If the contraction persists, firing frequency may decrease so as to optimize the stimulus rate with the prolonged duration of the muscle fibre action potential (muscle wisdom). The insertion of additional neural impulses into the train of stimuli can result in force potentiation (catch-like properties). Furthermore, there is evidence of neural potentiation and a dissociation of muscle activity with submaximal fatigue. Conversely, inhibition may be derived supraspinally or at the spinal level. While there may be some evidence of intrinsic motoneuronal fatigue, inhibitory afferent influences from chemical, tensile, pressure, and other factors play an important role in the competing influences on force output. Key words: postactivation potentiation, recruitment, rate coding, inhibition, catch-like properties",

OCD presents with disturbing recurrent intrusive thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors (compulsions) that are performed in order to diminish the distress of obsessions. Body dysmorphic disorder is characterized by extreme preoccupation and negative assessment of perceived physical defect. Hoarding disorder results from persistent difficulty in discarding items, leading to chronic and excessive acquisition. Trichotillomania is defined by compulsive and repetitive hair-pulling. Each of these disorders can cause significant distress and impairment and require knowledgeable and specific psychiatric assessment. Persistent and interfering preoccupations, accompanied by repetitive behaviors, are a common theme yet the clinical presentation, symptoms, treatments, and prognosis are unique to each disorder.",

The clinical features of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion often show the symptoms of cognitive impairment and organic psychosyndromes.

Pathological changes caused by chronic cerebral hypoperfusion often confined only to the white matter (demyelisation, glial activation, damage of oligodendroglial cells, as well as scattered cell death). Each therapy has an influence on the biochemical and pathophysiological alterations caused by chronic cerebral hypoperfusion can be used with reason in these disorders. The mechanism of action of vinpocetine is interfering on many aspects with the biochemical and pathophysiological processes attributable to chronic cerebral hypoperfusion, independently of the original alteration responsible for hypoperfusion. This fact might give an explanation on the beneficial effect of vinpocetine on clinical signs and symptoms of chronic cerebrovascular insufficiency.",

      "title": "Mechanism of Scalp and Skull Injuries, Concussion, Contusion and Laceration",
      "abstract": "EAD injury occurs as a result of the absorption of energy and may be classified as being either direct or indirect. A direct injury occurs when the head comes in contact with another object because of a difference in their velocities. Thus a moving object striking a stationary head or a moving head striking a stationary object will produce a direct injury. An indirect injury to the head is produced when the body is suddenly set in motion or brought to rest and forces are applied to the head indirectly, as in injuries or a fall in which the subject lands on his feet or buttocks. Regardless of whether the injury is direct or indirect, certain physical conditions are imposed on the head as energy is absorbed. These include deformation (change in shape of the skull), and acceleration or deceleration of the head caused by a blow. In the usual head injury in civilian life, deformation and acceleration or deformation and deceleration exist simultaneously or develop in rapid succession. With a direct injury it is possible that the head alone may be involved whereas with an indirect injury there is likelihood of damage not only to the head but to other parts of the body as well. In indirect injuries it is not essential for the head to come in contact with a nonmoving or slower moving object. The sudden acceleration of the head may produce sufficient physical force to result in intracranial damage. The socalled whiplash injuries of the head and neck and injuries of the head in a fall with the lower parts of the body first striking a nonmoving object are examples of indirect forces acting upon the head. Injuries of the craniospinal junction are frequent in head injury. Setting the freely movable head into motion results in stresses on the structures of the neck that fix the head to the body. These stresses are occasionally so severe as to result in ligamentous and muscular injury, fractures of the cervical spine and spinal cord and brain injury. A discussion of head injury must recognize the occurrence of craniocervical damage. It is quite possible that a patient suffering from a minor head injury may have sustained a major injury to the cervical spine.",

      "abstract": "\"Neurally-mediated (reflex) syncope\" refers to a reflex response that, when triggered, gives rise to vasodilation and/or bradycardia; however, the contribution of each of these two factors to systemic hypotension and cerebral hypoperfusion may differ considerably. The initial evaluation may lead to a certain diagnosis in the case of classical vasovagal syncope and of situational syncope. Classical vasovagal syncope is diagnosed if precipitating events such as fear, severe pain, emotional distress, instrumentation or prolonged standing, are associated with typical prodromal symptoms. Situational syncope is diagnosed if syncope occurs during or immediately after urination, defecation, cough or swallowing. In the absence of a certain diagnosis, absence of cardiac disease, long history of syncope, syncope after sudden unexpected unpleasant sight, sound or smell, prolonged standing at attention or crowded, warm places, nausea and vomiting, post-prandial and post-exercise state suggest a neurally-mediated cause which needs to be confirmed by specific tests. Among them, the most useful are carotid sinus massage and tilt testing. In general, education and reassurance are the sufficient initial treatment. Additional treatment may be necessary in high-risk or high-frequency settings. Treatment is not necessary in patients who have sustained a single syncope and are not having syncope in a high-risk setting. It is valuable to assess the relative contribution of cardioinhibition and vasodepression before embarking on treatment as there are different therapeutic strategies for the two aspects. Even if evidence of utility of such an assessment exists only for the carotid sinus massage, it is recommended to extend this assessment also by means of tilt testing or implantable loop recorder. Tilt training and isometric leg and arm counterpressure maneuvers are indicated in patients with recurrent vasovagal syncope. Cardiac pacing is indicated in patients with cardioinhibitory or mixed carotid sinus syndrome and in patients with cardioinhibitory vasovagal syncope with a frequency > 5 attacks per year or severe physical injury or accident and age > 40 years. The evidence fails to support the efficacy of any drug.",

      "abstract": "Muscle weakness has a multitude of causes. Some involve genetic or metabolic disturbances affecting the muscle directly, some are caused by interruptions to the transmission of impulses at the neuromuscular junction, still others by abnormalities in the muscle nerve supply. Disuse atrophy with profound weakness may be seen in advanced arthritis or in any other condition where chronic pain enforces immobility. There are numerous uncommon syndromes in which muscle weakness is an important component; many of these will come to a specialist neurologist for elucidation. Some weakness is temporary, recovery of strength often occurs in stroke or very commonly in Guillain-Barré syndrome. Cranial motor and peripheral muscular dysfunction in myasthenia gravis may respond to steroids, immuno-suppressants and either plasma exchange or immunoglobulin infusions as well as thymectomy and the use of pyridostigmine. There are presentations of ‘functional’ weakness (often unilateral and sometimes accompanied by sensory symptoms) commonly of prolonged duration, that are little altered by treatment of any kind, but are not readily assigned to any recognizable neurological diagnosis. This group of disorders reminds us that weakness is a subjective as well an objective and measurable symptom.",

      "abstract": "Mental illness can arise from over-compensation of neural processes when they attempt to correct nervous system perturbation, regardless of the original cause. Initial brain compromise can be caused by genes, toxins, chemicals, infective agents, hypoxia or trauma. The original insult leads to a compensatory process of ‘rendering the synapse supersensitive’, a general neural mechanism that is involved in nervous system adaptation, repair, and regeneration. For example, in psychoses, the many and diverse early risk factors that underlie the psychosis converge to increase the number of supersensitive dopamine D2 receptors (i.e., D2 receptors that are in the high-affinity state for dopamine). Supersensitivity of synapses compensates for and protects the brain from further injury. This leads to heightened neurotransmission, which is experienced subjectively as overstimulation, with subsequent attempts to psychologically adapt. Out of individual attempts at compensation, arise the signs and symptoms that have been identified with schizophrenia and other psychoses.",

      "abstract": "Perhaps among the central nervous system (CNS) conditions with muscle hyperactivity, dystonia and spasticity figure as those that are disabling and requiring therapeutic intervention. Dystonia is a neurological syndrome characterized by sustained muscle contractions usually producing twisting and repetitive movements or abnormal postures. The sustained movements of dystonia may have overlying spasms similar to tremor but have a directional preponderance. Three other important clinical features of dystonia are occurrences of pain, sensory trick phenomenon (i.e. touching “hot spots” in body surface that abolishes the dystonia), and changes in severity depending on activity and posture . Spasticity is typified by a velocity-dependent occurrence of a “catch” following passive limb movement. Recently, the scope of spasticity has been broadened in its definition as a disordered sensori-motor control resulting from an upper motor neuron (UMN) lesion presenting as intermittent or sustained involuntary activation of muscles(1-2) . Although their etiopathogenesis differ, both conditions overlap as regard the following: [a] occurrence of muscle co-contractions; [b] Overactivity involves not only extrafusal but also intrafusal muscles(3-4) [c] Intrinsic muscle changes in size and visceco-elastic properties (5-6); [d] contractures if left unattended (7);[e] muscular spread in synergy, “overflow” and compensatory muscles; [f ] loss of dexterity; [g] occurrence of pain to varying degrees; [h] secondary bone and joint abnormalities; [i] may lead to “compensatory circuitry changes” at segmental and suprasegmental levels (4) ; [j] May lead to posturing and cosmesis issues, and [k] hygiene, quality of life and social impact . Another common thread between dystonia and spasticity is the reduction in muscle tone following botulinum neurotoxin therapy (BoNT), and effectively addressing the disordered sensori-motor control in both conditions. Intuitively, BoNT will be most efficacious in cases with a combination of spasticity and dystonia (i.e. spastic dystonia), such as in childhood spasticity(8). This chapter summarizes the clinical efficacy of BoNT in both dystonia and spasticity.",

      "title": "Autism: Animal Models",
      "abstract": "Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impairments in social interaction, verbal and nonverbal communication, and restricted, repetitive, and stereotyped patterns of behavior, interests, and activities appearing before the age of three (American Psychiatric Association 1994). Its clinical manifestations and severity of impairments vary from mild to severe. The core symptoms are frequently accompanied by a spectrum of neurobehavioral derangements, including hyperactivity, aberrant sensitivity to sensory stimulation, anxiety, mental retardation, seizures, selfinjury, sleep disturbances, and upset to change in routine. The etiology of autism is thought to involve an interaction between genetic susceptibility, mediated by multiple genes, and environmental factors. Epidemiological studies find a four times higher incidence of autism in boys than in girls. Because the primary diagnostic criteria of autism are abnormal behaviors, rather than biochemical or neuroanatomical factors, the use of animal models in the study of autism is unavoidable, as this is the only way to study behavioral defects within the context of the whole organism.",

      "title": "Memory of Traumatic Stress",
      "abstract": "Extreme stress alters the coding of events in memory and may lead to disorders of the trauma spectrum, such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In order to understand the physiological basis and the common thread underlying PTSD, the concept of memory as it is related to trauma must be understood. Autobiographic memory can be divided into cold memories, including knowledge about life-time periods and specific events and hot memories, comprising emotional and sensory memories. Cold memories (On September 18 at 20:30 I was still working in my office) are usually connected with hot sensory memories, (black-masked, dark night, shooting) as well as with cognitive (I can't do anything), emotional (fear, sadness) and physiological elements (heart racing, fast breathing, sweating). Through this string of hot memories a fear network is built. Physiological changes in the brain and body of the survivor of a life-threatening experience, such as a response of the stress-related messengers (e.g., of the HPA axis) or the functioning and even structure of the medial temporal lobe and connected limbic networks in the brain, have been shown to be affected by traumatic stressors and are linked to the organization of memory. When we drive the organism down the defense cascade, when flight is not possible, fight futile and only a startling freeze is left in our evolutionary repertoire, functioning of the structures in the medial temporal lobe that are the portal for autobiographic memory is altered such that hot and cold memories lose their interconnectivity. Our data from survivors of severe violence and torture demonstrate functional alteration of fronto-temporal regions. In over 100 victims of severe and repeated torture, we observed a 94% prevalence of PTSD. In these patients, generators of abnormal slow waves indicated dysfunctional networks in the frontal lobe. Abnormalities in left fronto-temporal regions were connected with dissociative states. In addition a hyper-responsive fear-network can be demonstrated by rapid visual presentation of emotional material. In torture victims but not in controls, rapid presentation of affective pictorial stimuli activates frontal cortex. We hypothesize that it is this disconnection between hot and cold memories, indicated by abnormal brain waves, that leaves those experiencing flashbacks entangled in fear and anxiety. The victim is unable to place the flashback in time and space because the hot memory is not connected to the autobiographical cold memory. If this connection can be restored, the horror of the memory might be alleviated.",

Recent reports of its use in the cerebral palsies are encouraging but need to be placed in context.\n\nThe cerebral palsies are motor disorders arising from static brain abnormalities that may result from early embryological defects or damage in utero or early extrauterine life. Cerebral palsy phenotypes often include primary cognitive, psychiatric, sensory, and seizure disorders and a wide range of secondary skeletal and general medical illnesses. The motor disorders vary greatly in severity and neurological signs. Each pathology may therefore cause a range of types of cerebral palsy without any necessary concordance between pathological and clinical categories.5\n\nThe process of progressive developmental revelation with age, the cascade of disabilities in the first two to three decades, and the propensity of the developing nervous system to compensate for early damage (albeit by its …",

Compulsive behaviour is concerned most with hygiene, orderliness, checking, grooming, and hoarding, whereas obsessive thoughts (rumination) focus on harm avoidance and cultural taboos. Compulsive behaviours resemble stereotypic movements seen in animals or cultural rituals. Cognitively, anticipating potential future risk scenarios may help in minimising threat, suggesting that obsessivecompulsive disorder may be a by-product of foresight. Obsessive-compulsive disorder is often linked to life events that require heightened vigilance for threat, including sexual maturation (puberty), pregnancy, and childbirth. While most individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder follow a ‘slow’ life-history strategy, cases with increased impulsivity and reduced inhibitory control seem to pursue a ‘fast’ life-history strategy.",

Unlike active abuse, which involves acts of direct violence, neglect operates by omission, often being more difficult to identify, having equally devastating psychological effects. According to attachment theory, the absence of parents supports the formation of an unstable cohesion, predisposing the child to difficulties in emotional regulation and increased reactivity to stress. The lack of a predictable and protected environment leads to emotional disorders, favoring the development of maladaptive beliefs about oneself and the world, amplifying the feeling of insecurity and constant fear of danger. On an emotional level, chronic neglect often generates a high level of toxic stress, being conceptualized as an attachment trauma or a complex relational trauma with cumulative effects.",

A systematic approach is recommended when physicians encounter patients who primarily present with abnormal movements. This chapter illustrates a clinical-based approach that consists of main questions that need to be addressed consecutively in order to determine the correct diagnosis. These questions are: Are the movements involuntary? What is the dominant phenomenology? Where does the abnormal movement disorder originate? What are the associated features? What is the syndrome? What is the differential diagnosis? The identification of the clinical characteristics of abnormal movements and of the associated features defines the syndromic pattern.",

      "abstract": "Tremor, an involuntary, rhythmic, oscillatory movement of a body part, is the most common movement disorder encountered in clinical practice. Rest tremors occur in a body part that is relaxed and completely supported against gravity. Action tremors occur with voluntary contraction of a muscle and can be further subdivided into postural, isometric, and kinetic tremors. All persons have low-amplitude, high-frequency physiologic tremors at rest and during action that are not reported as symptomatic. The most common pathologic tremor is essential tremor. In one-half of cases, it is transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion, and it affects 0.4 to 6 percent of the population. More than 70 percent of patients with Parkinson disease have tremor as the presenting feature. This tremor is typically asymmetric, occurs at rest, and becomes less prominent with voluntary movement. Features consistent with psychogenic tremor are abrupt onset, spontaneous remission, changing tremor characteristics, and extinction with distraction. Other types of tremor are cerebellar, dystonic, drug- or metabolic-induced, and orthostatic. The first step in the evaluation of a patient with tremor is to categorize the tremor based on its activation condition, topographic distribution, and frequency. The diagnosis of tremor is based on clinical information obtained from a thorough history and physical examination. For particularly difficult cases, single-photon emission computed tomography to visualize the integrity of the dopaminergic pathways in the brain may be useful to diagnose Parkinson disease.",

Prevalence of this condition is unavailable in developing countries of the world.

Commonly picked parts of the body include the face (most picked), arms, legs, back, gums, neck, shoulders, scalp, abdomen, chest, the knuckles (via mouth leading to temporary disfiguration of distal and proximal joints of the middle and little fingers) and other extremities e.g. the fingernails, cuticles, and toe nails;5 skin picking may be accompanied by anxiety with depression following picking. It is often triggered by factors that include feeling or examining irregularities on the skin, feeling anxious etc. Complications include infections, tissue damage and sepsis.

      "title": "Walking abnormalities in children",
      "abstract": "Walking is a spontaneous movement termed locomotion that is promoted by activation of antigravity muscles by serotonergic (5HT) neurons. Development of antigravity activity follows 3 developmental epochs of the sleep-wake (S-W) cycle and is modulated by particular 5HT neurons in each epoch. Activation of antigravity activities occurs in the first epoch (around the age of 3 to 4 months) as restriction of atonia in rapid eye movement (REM) stage and development of circadian S-W cycle. These activities strengthen in the second epoch, with modulation of day-time sleep and induction of crawling around the age of 8 months and induction of walking by 1 year. Around the age of 1 year 6 months, absence of guarded walking and interlimb cordination is observed along with modulation of day-time sleep to once in the afternoon. Bipedal walking in upright position occurs in the third epoch, with development of a biphasic S-W cycle by the age of 4-5 years. Patients with infantile autism (IA), Rett syndrome (RTT), or Tourette syndrome (TS) show failure in the development of the first, second, or third epoch, respectively. Patients with IA fail to develop interlimb coordination; those with RTT, crawling and walking; and those with TS, walking in upright posture. Basic pathophysiology underlying these condition is failure in restricting atonia in REM stage; this induces dysfunction of the pedunculopontine nucleus and consequently dys- or hypofunction of the dopamine (DA) neurons. DA hypofunction in the developing brain, associated with compensatory upward regulation of the DA receptors causes psychobehavioral disorders in infancy (IA), failure in synaptogenesis in the frontal cortex and functional development of the motor and associate cortexes in late infancy through the basal ganglia (RTT), and failure in functional development of the prefrontal cortex through the basal ganglia (TS). Further, locomotion failure in early childhood causes failure in development of functional specialization of the cortex through the spinal stepping generator-fastigial nucleus-thalamus-cortex pathway. Early detection of locomotion failure and early adjustment of this condition through environmental factors can prevent the development of higher cortical dysfunction.",

      "title": "Sleep disturbances in pregnancy: Why and how should we manage them?",
      "abstract": "Maternal sleep quality worsens during pregnancy, already from the first trimester on and especially in the third trimester.1, 2 Nevertheless, the sleep quality is often ignored by both physicians as well as by women themselves as sleep quality is generally assumed to improve after delivery. However, sleep disturbances may continue during postpartum period or even become chronic. The most important sleep disturbances during pregnancy are primary insomnia, sleep disordered breathing (SDB) and restless legs syndrome (RLS).2, 3 Sleep disturbances typically cause sleep fragmentation and deterioration of sleep architecture leading to sleep loss and daytime sleepiness, tiredness, fatigue, cognitive difficulties and increase risk for accidents.2, 3 The algorithm of the diagnose and treatments of the most important sleep disturbances in pregnancy is illustrated in Figure 1. Primary insomnia includes both initiation insomnia, which shows as difficulties to fall asleep, and maintenance insomnia, which includes nightly awakenings and too early morning awakenings (being unable to fall asleep again). The etiology of primary insomnia during pregnancy is multifactorial, and might be associated with physical (hyperemesis, nocturia, joint and back pain, heartburn, nasal congestion, thermoregulatory problems, contractions, fetal movements, uncomfortable or unusual sleeping positions, dreams and nightmares) and mental (especially depression and anxiety) causes. Poor sleep quality has shown to be associated with the increased risk of complications such as gestational diabetes, preterm delivery, prolonged labor and increased risk of cesarean section.2, 3 Constant snoring is a typical feature of SDB, which includes sleep apnea and partial upper airway obstruction. In pregnant women, SDB is often caused by partial upper airway obstruction rather than of episodes of frank obstructive apnea.2 Gestational weight gain and estrogen-induced hyperemia, mucosal edema and mucus hypersecretion lead to the narrowing of upper airways exacerbating the risk for SDB. However, progesterone-induced stimulation of breathing, sleeping in lateral position, and decrease in the duration of rapid eye movement sleep (during which breathing is more unstable) may protect against SDB. Furthermore, micrognatia and loose throat and larynx are important risk factors for SDB. In addition to snoring, other typical symptoms are headache and dry month in the morning and daytime sleepiness (most typically irresistible falling asleep when inactive). SDB has shown to be in association with increased risk for gestational diabetes, pregnancy-induced hypertension, preeclampsia, intrauterine growth retardation, preterm delivery, cesarean section and neonatal intensive care unit admissions.2, 4 RLS is a nocturnal neurosensory movement disorder, which is connected with dopaminergic dysfunction. Although the etiology is still unclear, RLS may be idiopathic, genetic, or linked to various disorders, especially iron deficiency. RLS is characterized by unpleasant irritation, creeping, crawling, burning, pins-and-needles or itching sensations, most commonly in the legs. The sensations occur at rest and worsen towards the evening and night. Also smoking, use of caffeine, some medications or alcohol may initiate or exacerbate the symptoms. Transient RLS in previous pregnancies is associated with an elevated risk of new transient symptoms in future pregnancies, as well as with an increased risk for future development of chronic idiopathic RLS.2, 5 An association between RLS and hypertensive pregnancy disorders has been shown.2 Sleep disturbances during pregnancy are known risk factors for anxiety/depression both during pregnancy and postpartum period.1, 2, 6 Sleep disturbances often herald mood disturbances, and pregnant and postpartum women with mood symptoms typically suffer from sleep disturbances, especially from primary insomnia which may increase recurrence of a preexisting mental illness.6 Detection of the origin of the symptoms is the crucial first step in the management of maternal sleep disturbances. For the diagnosis of primary insomnia, questionnaires are feasible and sufficiently adequate tools in clinical practice. Because of the mismatch between subjective symptoms and objectively measured sleep quality, polysomnography, which measures sleep stages, is rarely needed.2 Of note is, that the patient may express having \"worse sleep quality\" or \"insomnia symptoms\", which may not stem from primary insomnia, but are secondary for instance for SDB (maintenance insomnia), RLS (initiation insomnia) or mental symptoms (initiation and maintenance insomnia). If SDB is suspected, ambulatory sleep polygraphy, which measures breathing and blood oxygen level is nessessary.2 In RLS, type and occurrence time of the symptoms and relief of the symptoms by movement, such as walking or stretching the limbs, are diagnostic. As iron deficiency may induce RLS, measurement of serum hemoglobin and ferritin (+C-reactive protein) is essential.5 To detect mental problems, especially depression and anxiety, structural questionnaires can be used.2 Good sleep hygiene is the basis of the treatment of all sleep disturbances. It includes convenient temperature in bedroom, reduced late fluid intake to prevent nocturia, suitable diet in case of gastro-esophageal reflux, massage in case of muscular pain and use of comfortable mattress and pillows. For primary insomnia non-pharmacologic treatments, especially cognitive behavioral therapy, is recommended and effective. It can be carried out as individual or group therapy. Additionally, yoga, acupuncture, mindfulness, and exercise are safe and effective. In case of severe or persistent insomnia, a short-term use of sedatives (including sedative antihistamines), sleeping pills (especially benzodiazepine–like drugs) or low dose antidepressants (with sedative properties) can be prescribed after risks and benefits consideration. However, all these drugs pass the placenta and although no teratogenic effects has been shown, they may be harmful for fetus and new-born. A long-term use of sedatives and sleeping pills should not be offered, since they often leads to noxious effects, like deterioration of sleep architecture and dependence on medication. Melatonin or herbal preparations, like valerian, are not recommended for treatment of insomnia during pregnancy or lactation because of the lack of safety and efficacy data. In cases of insomnia due to aggravating of mood symptoms, antidepressants, especially serotonin reuptake inhibitors, may be warranted.2 The gold standard treatment for SDB is nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and it is shown to be safe and effective also during pregnancy. After the diagnosis of SDB, CPAP treatment should be initiated without a delay. Positional treatment, especially lateral sleep posture, is recommendable. In general rule, surgical procedures should not be performed during pregnancy for the treatment of SDB. Local nasal congestive and corticosteroid treatments reduce nasal mucosal edema and thus improve nasal ventilation. In addition, treating respiratory infections effectively and gastro-esophageal reflux with tilted position of the upper body while in bed or proton-pump inhibitors, such as omeprazole, are also important.2 For the treatment of RLS, per oral iron supplementation (accompanied with C-vitamin for better iron absorption; serum ferritin level <75 μg/L) is recommended. However, in severe RLS (and with serum ferritin level <30 μg/L), oral iron is often insufficient or has a too slow effect and thus intravenous iron, safe also during pregnancy, may be needed. In addition, folate supplementation is favorable for RLS and it is also advisable during the periconception and early pregnancy period for fetal development. In addition, the use of magnesium may be beneficial, although the efficacy data is insufficient. Furthermore, relaxation procedures, walking, stretching, massage, use of compression stockings while sleeping or a warm bath before going to bed may also relieve the symptoms. In severe cases, pramipexole, levodopamin/carbidopamin, opioids, bensodiazepins or gabapentin beyond the first trimester may be needed under a consultation of a neurologist, with the lowest efficient dose, although all these medications may induce risks and side-effects for fetus and new-born.2, 5 Although sleep disturbances are frequent during pregnancy, the sleep quality is not systematically assessed during pregnancy follow-ups. Furthermore, the research evaluating the reasons and consequences of maternal sleep disturbances and the safety and efficacy of the treatments are scant. Good sleep quality is, nevertheless, essential for good quality of life and good health state and thus additional research in the field is indispensable.",

      "abstract": "The term stands for suicides committed by using more than one method. A distinction can be made between planned and unplanned complex suicides (primary/secondary combinations). In planned complex suicides 2 or more methods are applied simultaneously in order to make sure that death will occur even if one method fails. In unplanned complex suicides the mode of performance is changed after the first method chosen failed or was working too slow or proved to be too painful. In planned complex suicides typically two of the generally common methods of suicide (e.g. ingestion of medicines, hanging, use of firearms, drowning, fall from a height) are combined. But also unusual combinations have been described such as the simultaneous firing of two guns, self-immolation in combination with other suicide methods or shooting oneself while driving a car. In unplanned complex suicides self-inflicted injuries by sharp force, especially cuts of the wrists, are often found as the primary act of suicide. In some cases the suicide switches from cuts to stabs (mostly to the heart region). Other methods often used after the first phase of suicide are hanging and jump from a height. In the literature the use of up to 5 suicidal methods applied one after the other have been described.",

Sua manifestação inicial ocorre, em sua maioria, durante a infância ou adolescência, podendo persistir por um período extenso na ausência de intervenções terapêuticas apropriadas. Caracterizada clinicamente pela presença de tiques motores e vocais, a ST exerce um impacto substancial na qualidade de vida e nas relações sociais dos indivíduos acometidos.Apesar de sua etiologia ainda não estar plenamente elucidada, há evidências sugerindo que fatores genéticos e alterações no desenvolvimento neurobiológico desempenhem papéis cruciais em sua manifestação. O diagnóstico é primariamente clínico, carecendo de exames de imagem ou laboratoriais específicos para sua confirmação. Uma avaliação cuidadosa voltada para a identificação de comorbidades psiquiátricas associadas é mandatória, visto que há uma prevalência acentuada desses distúrbios neuropsiquiátricos concomitantes em pacientes com ST.Dada a complexidade da ST e o profundo comprometimento funcional associado, uma abordagem terapêutica individualizada e centrada nas necessidades específicas do paciente se faz necessária. O tratamento deve ser orientado para o manejo dos sintomas mais gravosos ou que mais prejudicam a qualidade de vida do indivíduo.

      "title": "Effects of specifically sequenced massage on spastic muscle properties and motor skills in adolescents with cerebral palsy",
      "abstract": "Cerebral Palsy (CP) is the most common childhood disability, with an incidence around 2-2.5 in every 1,000 live births in Europe. It results from damage to the developing brain and adversely affects motor control. The limitations in motor control range from an inability to even hold the head erect and an inability to self-feed, to cases where for example walking is hampered by spasticity in one limb. \nThe cornerstone of current treatment is physiotherapy in which the aims are to maintain and improve mobility and to prevent limitation of the range of joint movement. Specific forms of physical therapy include Conductive Education and Bobath treatment. Other interventions include botulinum toxin injections, intrathecal baclofen, selective dorsal rhizotomy and multi-level orthopaedic surgery. Despite these varied and concerted inputs, improvements in motor skills are very limited – motor skills tend to plateau around the age of seven and in fact deteriorate in adolescence. \nOf the four classifications of CP (Spastic, Athetoid or Dyskinetic, Ataxic and Mixed), the spastic type is the most common. Around 75% of all cases are spastic and around 60% of these are diplegic (meaning it affects both limbs, usually the legs). Spastic diplegia results from periventricular leucomalacia, where oligodendrocytes are damaged by hypo-perfusion of the periventriucular areas predominantly affecting the corticospinal tracts supplying the legs. This results in a deficit in the development of the white matter forming the insulation around those nerves and consequently compromises the signal transduction to the legs. As spastic diplegia is the most common type of CP, and the presenting symptoms are considered less complex than the other types, patients with spastic diplegia were chosen for participation in the current studies.\nThe main symptoms presenting in spastic diplegia are reduced gross motor function, increased reflex response to muscle stretch, reduced range of ankle movement and shortened calf muscle/tendon units, evident in equinus. \nWhilst the main cause of spasticity in conditions other than CP is considered to be the neuropathology, altered muscle properties are considered to be the main problem in CP. Masseurs contend that they bring about a healthy response in damaged muscle by altering the resting state of the muscle, although this has not been scientifically proven until now.\nThe initial aim of the present series of studies was to test if a specific massage sequence could increase the range of movement at the ankle joint by altering the mechanical properties of the muscle in adolescents with spastic diplegia. However the investigations indicated that instead, this type of massage changed sensory feedback from the spastic muscles, which led to significant improvements in motor skills. The physical limitations of the 12 participants with CP range from habitual wheelchair users to one participant who is able to run. Their abilities classified by the Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) ranged from level I to IV. The investigation involved the use of goniometry to measure change in the active and passive range of movement at the ankle joint and EMGs to measure incidence of stretch reflex contractions. Motor skills were assessed by an independent physiotherapist, using the Gross Motor Function Measure-66 (GMFM-66). \nIn chapter 3, three passive ankle dorsiflexions at a controlled rate were carried out before and after massage which was given twice weekly for 5 weeks. The incidence of stretch reflex contractions during passive dorsiflexion was reduced from 40% in the first 5 massage sessions to 22% in the last 5 sessions, in the 5 participants tested. After massage the resistance of the calf muscle to stretch was not reduced as expected; in fact the muscles were stiffer (more force was needed to take the ankle through the same range of movement). However, the resting angles of the ankles often changed, indicating alteration of the resting length of the calf muscles. The change was not always in the one direction, although, on the whole, muscles lengthened after massage (shown by an average increase in dorsiflexion of 1.4o). It is argued that thixotropic properties of muscles were responsible and that the massage changed the mechanical properties of the calf muscles.\nIn chapter 4, Gross Motor Function Measure-66 scores for all 12 adolescent participants who received the specialised massage were shown to be improved by an average of 5.8. Five of the 7 participants showed improvements in their ability to descend stairs, which is recognised to be particularly difficult in spastic diplegia. The range of voluntary ankle movement improved in some participants in some tests.\nDespite a lack of scientific evidence, masseurs also contend that their intervention brings about change by altering the blood flow. In the current studies, near infrared spectroscopy was used to measure oxygenation of the muscles and changes in the skin temperatures were also recorded. In chapter 5, temperature recorded from the skin over the calf muscle after massage was increased in both the CP group and the controls. Both finished with comparable temperatures although the CP group’s temperatures started 1-1.5°C below those of the control group. Contralateral effects of raised skin temperature were also observed. It was confirmed that the extent of change in skin temperature over the massaged muscles could be used to determine the effectiveness of a trainee using the massage technique. Additionally, the oxygenation of the tissue was altered significantly at some stage during massage for all participants. It is proposed that spastic muscles in CP may sometimes operate in oxygen debt, particularly in cold conditions.\nThe improvements in GMFM-66 with massage are at least as effective as other current therapies and the massage has none of the adverse side effects of surgery and drug interventions. The mean improvement in GMFM-66 score after massage was 5.8, whereas treatments using selective dorsal rhizotomy and baclofen showed improvements of only 2.7 and 3.8 respectively.\nIt is proposed that the mechanical properties and the feedback from spastic muscles are altered by the massage and that the CNS is able to accommodate the change in feedback to produce improved motor function.\nIt is recommended that the massage used here be incorporated into the physiotherapy regime for individuals with CP.\nAuthor’s contact details: e-mail r.macgregor.1@research.gla.ac.uk",

      "title": "Effect of Conventional Physiotherapy and Modified Constraint Induced Movement Therapy through Play way Method to Improve the Upper Extremity Motor Skills among the Children with Hemi paretic Cerebral Palsy",
      "abstract": "There is a tendency in children with unilateral involvement to use their non-affected hand as the dominant hand, even when the actual functional loss is mild.  The potential use of the affected upper extremity of children with hemiparetic CP often fails due to “developmental non-use”, and this leads to increased muscle tone, and decreased active and passive range of motion of the joints of the limb, poor motor control, generalized weakness, and a delay in skeletal maturation. There are many systems of physiotherapy treatment for CP. Active challenging rehabilitation may prevent or minimize the adaptive musculoskeletal and behavioral changes associated with the negative features (Carr & Shepherd, 2000). Early intervention for children with CP has been advocated to help infants achieve their abilities in the most normal way for them, based on the principles of central nervous system plasticity (Shumway-Cook &Woollacott, 2001). Conventional Physiotherapy includes the following therapies:  passive or active exercise both to maintain and increase range of motion.  Active or resistive exercise increase muscle strength that may use manual resistance, free weight and training in functional skills such as bed mobility and transfers.  Physical therapy will help the child to enhance their independence, physical and emotional well-being. Conventional Physiotherapy treatment approaches focus on a mix of biomechanical, developmental, neurodevelopment, and rehabilitation models (CCHMC, 2009). This therapeutic approach involves constraining of the unaffected upper extremity using sling, plaster cast, mitt or splints and intensive training of the affected upper extremity with task-specific, goal-oriented activities by reinforcement (shaping technique). Constraint Induced Movement Therapy (CIMT) has not been studied in the pediatric population to the extent that it has been in adult with stroke. To hold a child’s interests for a long period, the types of practice used in adult CIMT need to be modified to be suitable for children.  As a result of participation, children are made to use their limbs unimanually.

      "abstract": "All those involved in the care of babies need to maintain a high index of suspicion regarding the possibility of seizures. Not only are seizures common in the first few days of life, but they are also difficult to diagnose because the clinical manifestations are varied, subtle, and unlike those seen at other times of life. The diagnosis of seizure should be considered if a baby makes odd repetitive stereotyped movements of the limbs or face. Subtle seizures can manifest as repetitive blinking, chewing, eye-rolling or darting tongue movements. Seizures can also involve a stare without blinking, forced eye deviation, peculiar limb postures, apnea or a fixed smile. Ocular manifestations are common, and eye closure during a suspicious event makes the diagnosis of seizure less likely, although it does not exclude it completely [1]. Myoclonic jerks can be normal in sleep but myoclonic epilepsy does occasionally manifest in the neonatal period. Clinical seizures are often short-lived in babies; typically the baby becomes still, there is a change in breathing pattern (sometimes apnea), and a change in level of alertness followed by subtle repetitive movements involving the face or limbs. The whole episode may be over in less than a minute, but the same pattern does tend to recur, in which case it becomes more suspicious.",

      "abstract": "Les consequences d'un accident vasculaire cerebral peuvent conduire a developper un syndrome de paresie spastique. Ce dernier etant principalement caracterise par une paresie des muscles agonistes (effecteurs du mouvement) et une hyperactivite des muscles antagonistes (tel que la spasticite declenche par un etirement phasique, ou la cocontraction spastique declenche lors du mouvement volontaire). D'un point de vue biomecanique, l'alteration motrice des patients peut etre la combinaison d'une paresie musculaire des agonistes et de resistances au mouvement des antagonistes (hyperactivite musculaire et myopathie spastique). Bien que la toxine botulique soit le traitement de premiere intention de l'hyperactivite musculaire via un affaiblissement selectif des muscles hyperactifs, ses effets sur la fonction motrice, la cocontraction spastique et la plasticite cerebrale restent peu documentes. Ainsi, les principaux objectifs de ce travail de these etaient (1) d'evaluer les determinants cliniques et les mecanismes neuromusculaires associes a la limitation des mouvements du membre superieur, (2) d'investiguer le lien entre l'activite oscillatoire corticale et le niveau de la cocontraction spastique, et (3) d'explorer l'effet combine de la toxine botulique et de la reeducation sur la plasticite neuromusculaire induite. Pour repondre a ces questions, nous avons adopte une approche multimodale incluant des investigations cliniques, biomecaniques et neurophysiologiques. Nos resultats ont revele la presence de cocontractions spastiques des flechisseurs du coude, que ce soit en conditions isometriques ou lors du mouvement, et ont objective une association entre le niveau de cocontraction spastique et la limitation du mouvement actif d'extension de coude. Nos resultats ont egalement mis en evidence que la diminution de l'activite corticale oscillatoire dans le cortex sensorimoteur ipsilesionnel etait associee au niveau de cocontraction spastique. Enfin, apres une injection de toxine botulique dans les muscles flechisseurs du coude et en association avec une auto reeducation, nous avons observe une diminution de leur niveau de cocontraction spastique associee a une amelioration de la fonction motrice et a une modulation de l'activite oscillatoire corticale. L'ensemble des resultats de ce travail suggere que la cocontraction spastique est un facteur determinant de l'alteration de la fonction motrice, avec une mise en jeu de mecanismes supra- spinaux. La prise en charge de l'hyperactivite musculaire par injection de toxine botulique associee a de la reeducation peut favoriser une plasticite neuromusculaire benefique sur l'activite corticale et la fonction motrice.",

The somatic manifestations are mediated through the autonomic and central nervous systems and are present as penile erection, increased heart rate, elevated blood pressure, deepened respiration and flushed facies. The psychologic reactions are experienced as specific pleasure and accompanying specific displeasure, or tension. As the tension becomes more acute, the degree of excitation increases. It is a unique feeling of pleasure, as well as prevailing discomfort, which demands relief in the ejaculation.

This paper reviews the available knowledge on the treatment of the disorder and suggests specific intervention guidelines. Many children display repetitive motor behaviours as a normal aspect of development. These behaviours are usually transitory and do not become a prominent part of the child's presentation. The early stereotyped behaviours of infancy appear to become less a part of the child's behavioural repertoire as the child increasingly attends more to external stimuli in the environment and less to internal stimuli. For some children, however, stereotyped behaviours can increase with age and become both extremely resistant to treatment and, in some cases, self‐injurious (Rojahn 1987).",

The correlates of emotional incapacities, emotional hypersensitivity, and normal emotional activities in psychopaths are studied and discussed in this paper. Emotional hypersensitivity might be linked with: a history of neglect, rejection and abuse; insult; changes which are forced or not under control of the psychopath; obstacles that prevent the psychopath to do what he or she wants to do; narcissistic injury; broken friendships or relationship. Normal emotional functioning might be associate with grief, warm relationship, adequate attention, disease, academic and/or occupational success, impressive events, confrontations, contemplation and maturation, hidden suffering (also as a result of neurobiological determination).",

Sexual dysfunction is a significant, but often underestimated, symptom of multiple sclerosis, affecting 50–90% of men and 40–80% of women. The types of sexual dysfunction can be categorized in terms of the normal sexual response cycle: sexual interest/desire dysfunction (reduced libido), sexual arousal dysfunction (including erectile dysfunction) and ejaculatory and orgasmic dysfunction. Sexual dysfunction may not only be due to lesions affecting the neural pathways involved in physiological function (primary dysfunction), but also result from general physical disabilities (secondary dysfunction) or psychological and emotional issues (tertiary dysfunction). Comprehensive management should address all these possible contributing problems. Specific pharmacotherapy is only currently available for erectile dysfunction. This review summarizes the available information about sexual dysfunction in men and women with multiple sclerosis.",

This may also be disassociated, affecting only one type of eye movements, and this suggests supranuclear lesions. Concerting lateral movements, complete paralysis of abduction, adduction (sparing convergence) or ipsilateral laterality is suggestive of damage to the radicular fibres of the abducencs nucleus (VI), to its internuclear neurons or to the nucleus itself respectively. Isolated paralysis of saccades is in favour of a lesion of the paramedian pontine reticular formation. As regards vertical movements, paralysis of the oculomotor nerve (III), either isolated or associated with complete paralysis of the contralateral rectus superior oculi muscle, suggests a lesion of the radicular fibres of III or of the nucleus itself respectively. Paralysis of downward or both downward and upward saccades indicates the presence of bilateral lesions in the region of the mesencephalic reticular formation. Paralysis of upward saccades alone reflects a unilateral lesion located near the posterior commissure.",

The site of involvement may be (i) peripheral nerve and root, (ii) spinal cord or (iii) brain. It may accompany a variety of peripheral and central neurological disorders, including postherpetic neuralgia, peripheral neuropathy, trigeminal neuralgia, traumatic nerve injury, complex regional pain syndrome, multiple sclerosis and stroke.3\n\nNeuromyelitis optica is a relapsing inflammatory astrocytopathic disorder affecting predominantly the optic nerves and spinal cord. It is associated with antiaquaporin-4 immunoglobulin G (AQP4-IgG) in up to 70% of patients. Spinal cord involvement typically presents as a longitudinally-extensive transverse myelitis with associated sensorimotor and sphincter dysfunction. Sensory symptoms such as numbness, dysaesthesia, pain and tonic spasms are common.4 This report highlights neuropathic pruritus as an under-recognised feature of neuromyelitis optica.\n\nA 45-year-old woman with no previous medical history presented with a 4-day history of unexplained nausea, vomiting, hiccup and vertigo. On the fourth day, she developed bilateral forearm itching. Over the following 3 days, she developed rapidly progressive weakness from the chest down, ultimately resulting in complete paraplegia, sensory loss and loss of both bladder and bowel function. She also developed weakness in both arms, worse on the left side.\n\nShe was admitted 3 days after the onset of her nausea and vomiting, which subsided a day later. However, the itching …",

The diseases evolving due to mind-body interaction are termed as psychosomatic diseases.[1] Vega means the natural urges of the body and mind. Dharaniya Vega are the suppressible or controllable urges which are not only confined to psychological attribute but also to verbal and physical attributes.[2] Some diseases or their subtypes in Ayurveda are nomenclatured based on suppressible urges like Shokaja Atisara (diarrhea due to grief), Bhayaja Atisara (diarrhea due to fear), Kamaj Jwara (fever due to passion),etc.[3,4] Sattvavajay Chikitsa given in Charak Samhita is a psychotherapy which literary means controlling the mind from unhealthy actions which has been developed as a counselling tool.

Functional (psychogenic) neurological diseases, also called conversion disorders, are involuntary.

The term “functional” is beginning to replace “psychogenic” in many circumstances. This chapter discusses clinical features of functional neurological disorders in detail. Negative neurological symptoms like loss of consciousness, blindness, constriction of visual field, motor paralysis, and loss of pain sense are commonly seen in functional diseases, but positive symptoms like convulsion and involuntary movements are more common. Among others, functional movement disorders are not infrequent and have drawn particular attention in the recent years. Within the movement disorders, functional tic-like movements might be difficult to distinguish from real tics, and in fact these two may overlap within the patient.",

      "title": "Fatigue Versus Activity-Dependent Fatigability in Patients With Central or Peripheral Motor Impairments",
      "abstract": "In the rehabilitation literature, fatigue is a common symptom of patients with any neurological impairment when defined as a subjective lack of physical and mental energy that interferes with usual activities. Some complaints may, however, arise from fatigability , an objective decline in strength as routine use of muscle groups proceeds. By this refined definition of fatigue, exercise or sustained use reduces the ability of muscles to produce force or power, regardless of whether the task can be sustained. Fatigability may be masked clinically because (1) the degree of weakening is not profound, (2) activity-induced weakness rapidly lessens with cessation of exertion, and (3) clinicians rarely test for changes in strength after repetitive movements to objectively entertain the diagnosis. The repetitive movements that induce fatigability during daily activities are an iterative physiological process that depends on changing states induced by activation of spared central and peripheral neurons and axons and compromised muscle. Fatigability may be especially difficult to localize in patients undergoing neurorehabilitation, in part because no finite boundary exists between the central and peripheral components of motor reserve and endurance. At the bedside, however, manual muscle testing before and after repetitive movements could at least put some focus on the presence of fatigability in any patient with motor impairments and related disabilities. Reliable measures of fatigability beyond a careful clinical examination, such as physiological changes monitored by cerebral functional neuroimaging techniques and more standardized central and peripheral electrical and magnetic stimulation paradigms, may help determine the mechanisms of activity-dependent weakening and lead to specific therapies. Testable interventions to increase motor reserve include muscle strengthening and endurance exercises, varying the biomechanical requirements of repetitive muscle contractions, and training-induced neural plasticity or pharmacologic manipulations to enhance synaptic efficacy.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Pregnancy may be difficult to achieve in women with neurological disability. Maintenance and restoration of sexual function, of which pregnancy is a consequential part, is a goal of neurological rehabilitation (1). In practice, however, professional attention to the sexual problems of people with disabilities (and perhaps in women with disabilities in particular) is often inadequate, delayed or non-existent. When undertaken, an assessment must take sensitive account of a patient's history, personality and social setting. It may be difficult to return to a pre-existing relationship following the acquisition of physical disability. For example, following a brain injury there may be personality change, unstable mood, and fatigability. Following a spinal injury there will be a change or loss in mobility, sexual responses and sensory functions. New sexual and relationship problems may not resolve spontaneously with time, and may become entrenched and unmanageable unless addressed expertly and appropriately in a timely way.",

      "abstract": "Psychological stress is common and contributes to many physical and mental health problems. Its effects are mediated by a complex neurobiological system centering in the brain with effectors including autonomic nervous system, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, inflammatory system, and gene expression. A stressor pushes the human physiological system away from its baseline state towards a lower utility state. The physiological system may return towards the original state but may be shifted to a lower utility state. While some physiological changes induced by stressors may benefit health, chronic stressors usually have negative effects on health. In contrast to this stressor effect is the system's resilience which influences its ability to return to the high utility attractor basin following a perturbation by increasing the likelihood and/or speed of returning to the baseline state following a stressor.",

La ceguera, diplopia o paralisis de la mirada son los signos neuroftalmologicos mas frecuentes en el trastorno conversivo. Describimos el caso de un nino con ptosis como manifestacion de un trastorno conversivo. Metodo y resultados: Varon de 9 anos en estudio por ptosis unilateral izquierda de inicio brusco, sin antecedentes medicos relevantes. En la exploracion se aprecia ptosis de ceja y palpebral izquierda, sin alteraciones de la motilidad ocular intrinseca ni extrinseca. Dado que la exploracion no se justifica por patologia de ningun par craneal, se sospecha ptosis miogenica y se solicita estudio. Las pruebas complementarias, tales como analitica autoinmune, test de estimulacion repetitiva, etc. fueron negativas. Tras descartar patologia organica y conocer situacion emocional inestable por separacion de sus padres, es valorado por el servicio de psiquiatria con diagnostico de trastorno conversivo. Conclusion: La ptosis es una rara manifestacion del trastorno conversivo, y aun mas en la infancia. Solo hemos encontrado dos casos descritos en la literatura. Es importante descartar patologia organica, diferenciar esta patologia de la simulacion y conocerla para incluirla en el diagnostico diferencial de la ptosis. EnglishPurpose: Conversion disorder is defined by DSM-IV as a deficit of sensory or motor function that cannot be explained by a medical condition and where psychological factors are judged to be associated with the deficit because symptoms are preceded by conflicts or other stressors. Blindness, diplopia or paralysis of the gaze are the most frequent neurophthalmological signs in the conversion disorder. We describe the case of a child with ptosis as a manifestation of a conversion disorder. Method and results: A 9-year-old male with abrupt left unilateral ptosis, without relevant medical history. On exploration, present left eyebrow and palpebral ptosis, without intrinsic or extrinsic ocular motility alterations. Since the examination is not justified by pathology of any cranial nerve pair, myogenic ptosis is suspected and study. Complementary tests were negative (autoimmune analytics, repetitive stimulation test, etc.). After ruling out organic pathology and knowing unstable emotional situation by separation from their parents, it is valued by the psychiatry service with a diagnosis of conversion disorder. Conclusion: Ptosis is a rare manifestation of the conversion disorder, and even more so in childhood. We have only found two cases in the literature. It is important to rule out organic pathology, differentiate this pathology from the simulation and know it to include in the differential diagnosis of ptosis.",

Stroke is the third main cause of the death & disability in India. There are two major categories of brain damage in stroke i.e. ischemia & haemorrhage. The aim of rehabilitation in subjects with hemiplegia is to promote recovery of lost function, independence, and early reintegration into social and domestic life. Many stroke patients have a number of serious disorders such as hemiplegia, motor disturbance, sensory disability, and cognitive impairment. Stroke rehabilitation is the process by which those with disabling strokes undergo treatment to help them return to normal life as much as possible by regaining and relearning the skills of everyday living. Physiotherapy treatment includes conventional therapies & neurophysiological approaches. Conventional therapies(Therapeutic Exercises, Traditional Functional Retraining) comprises of: Range Of Motion (ROM) Exercises i.e. passive followed by active assisted, active then active resisted exercises, Muscle Strengthening Exercises to reduce flaccidity, Stretching techniques to reduce spasticity, Mobilization techniques, Fitness training & Compensatory Techniques. Neurophysiological Approaches: 1. Muscle Re-education Approach. 2. Neurodevelopmental Approaches: – Sensorimotor Approach (Rood, 1940S), Movement Therapy Approach (Brunnstrom, 1950S), NDT Approach (Bobath, 1960-70S), PNF Approach (Knot and Voss, 1960-70S). 3. Motor Relearning Program for Stroke (1980S). 4. Contemporary Task Oriented Approach (1990S). We conclude that above all the techniques, Bobath, NDT, PNF, Roods approach, speech therapy, robotic devices, balance training and kinesiotapping are effective in the improvement of patient’s condition.",

Le tremblement n'est pas une pathologie mortelle, mais elle diminue souvent considerablement la qualite de vie de la personne. Les traitements efficaces ne sont pas encore disponibles, puisque les solutions pharmacologiques et chirurgicales souffrent encore de limitations en termes d'efficacite, de risques et de couts. Une alternative consiste a utiliser des technologies d'assistance, tels que les exosquelettes ou la Stimulation Electrique Fonctionnelle (SEF).Neanmoins, la conception de systemes actifs de compensation des tremblements presente plusieurs defis. Un tel systeme doit etre capable, par exemple, d'attenuer les tremblements tout en minimisant la fatigue, la douleur et l'inconfort induit. Il doit aussi distinguer entre le tremblement et le mouvement volontaire, afin de reduire les interferences sur les mouvements intentionnels.Cette these se concentre donc sur l'evaluation de l'usage de la SEF pour attenuer le tremblement. Une premiere contribution concerne le developpement des modeles neuromusculosquelettiques pour etudier l'influence des boucles reflexes sur la dynamique du tremblement, ainsi que la modulation de l'impedance de l'articulation via la co-contraction induite par la SEF. Un algorithme pour estimer en ligne le tremblement et ses caracteristiques tout en filtrant le mouvement volontaire a ete propose et valide sur patients. Enfin, un systeme SEF pour attenuer le tremblement base sur le controle d'impedance a ete concu et evalue sur patients, alors qu'une deuxieme strategie en boucle fermee a ete testee sur des sujets sains.",

      "title": "Closed Head Traumatic Brain Injury Drives Protracted Inflammation and Remodeling of Serotonergic Architecture in the Dorsal Raphe Nucleus",
      "abstract": "Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) presents a monumental public health burden that affects over 3 million Americans annually, with mild TBI (mTBI)/concussion being the most common form of closed head injury. Chronic neuropsychiatric sequalae are common following TBI, with many individuals spontaneously developing persistent depression, anxiety, social withdrawal and/or PTSD, disorders that have been previously linked to alterations in serotonin (5-HT) signaling. Currently, the effects of various forms of TBI on the function of the 5-HT signaling system within the CNS are poorly understood and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) fail to mitigate the clinical neuropsychiatric sequalae elicited by TBI. The lack of any FDA-approved therapies for the treatment of acute or chronic symptoms of TBI necessitates a greater understanding of how TBI alters the environmental milieu of the CNS, including normal, physiologic 5-HT signaling. We hypothesize that TBI drives the formation of aberrant behavioral states linked to neuropsychiatric disorders through alterations of normal, physiologic 5-HT signaling stemming from 5-HT neurons located within the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN). To test this hypothesis, adult, wild type C57Bl/6J mice were subjected to a single, blast induced mTBI or sham treatment, followed by behavioral and/or molecular analyses 0-10 days post-injury (dpi). mTBI subjects exhibited significantly increased righting reflex times (RRT) compared to their sham counterparts immediately post-injury. Ten dpi, mTBI subjects exhibited significant reductions in sociability and social dominance as compared to their sham counterparts in the Crawley three chamber sociability assay and tube test, respectively. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) revealed a time-dependent increase in total levels of 5-HT and its metabolite, 5HIAA within the DRN 10 dpi. No effect of mTBI on 5-HT or 5HIAA levels were found in prefrontal cortex (PFC) or somatosensory cortex (SSC), areas of high 5-HT innervation. Ten dpi, DRN punches were subjected to RNA-sequencing to delineate differential gene-expression profiles elicited by mTBI. Genes indicative of cellular remodeling, cell-to-cell adhesion, monoaminergic processing, and proliferation were identified. Crucially, genes involved in ongoing inflammation including those relevant to peripheral immune recruitment and blood brain barrier permeation were found to be differentially expressed. Quantitative real-time PCR was subsequently used to confirm differential expression of genes of interest, notably Vegfc, Slc18a1, and Icam1. These studies provide critical insight into ongoing molecular processes following closed head injury that may impact normal, physiologic 5-HT signaling within the DRN. Further, these studies may provide critical insight into regulation of 5-HT neuron function within the DRN and yield novel drug candidates for ameliorating the neuropsychiatric complications elicited by TBI.",

      "abstract": "During adolescence physical, psychic and social changes occure more rapidly and to a greater extent than during any other period of live. The marked changes concern not only the outern appearence, but also its intrapsychic representations, the body image. The complex integrative processes towards the identity as man or woman cannot be mastered without a certain emotional and physical instability. This is particularly the case if, in addition, nearly infantile disturbances in the socialisation or conflicts specific for this life period are, or have been, present. They can in the sense of a disposition lead to the manifestation of more or less severe crisis in adolescence. These crises interfere not only with the body image, but in many cases with the somatic functions as well. In the study three general aspects of this developmental problem are discussed as far they are relevant in the therapy of psycho-somatic disturbances in adolescents. 1. The implication of the adolescent phase in the course of psycho-somatic diseases. 2. Diseases which mainly occure in adolescence and are predominantly confined to this life period or are mainly influenced by it. 3. The influence which conflicts and phase-specific anxieties and fantasies exercise on the development and establishment of a mature body image and an adult identity.",

      "title": "What Illnesses Do Psychiatrists Treat?",
      "abstract": "Abstract Psychiatric disorders reflect dysfunction of the human mind and behavior and are diagnosed according to specific criteria. As noted in Chapter 1, dysfunction of the human mind results in symptoms in three primary spheres: thinking (cognition), emotion (meaning), and motivation (ability to set and achieve goals). These disorders can also produce a variety of physical (or “neurovegetative”) symptoms that include changes in appetite, sleep, sexual function, and energy level, among others. Some people develop symptoms suggestive of other medical or neurological disorders, such as heart palpitations, shortness of breath, pain, and memory disturbances. Additionally, patients with serious medical and neurological disorders can develop psychiatric disorders (e.g., people with diabetes are prone to develop depression), with adverse effects likely affecting the outcome of both conditions.",

The first involves externalizing behavioral problems (conduct disorder and oppositional defiant disorder); the second involves internalizing behavioral problems (emotional disorder) [1] that manifest as depression, anxiety, withdrawal, and psychosomatic diseases. Behavioral problems include repeated deviant behavior or aggression among children. Such conduct problems often lead to criminal behavior or substance abuse and place the society as a whole under substantial financial burden and distress. Thus, these conditions are serious public health concerns. Such mental health problems in children may be caused by developmental disorders such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorders (also known as ADHD), and mental disorders such as schizophrenia. Externalization and internalization may occasionally coexist, as seen in individuals who withdraw from society and subsequently engage in domestic violence.",

      "title": "The relationship between Stigma and Self-Efficacy in individuals with epilepsy or nonepileptic attack disorder",
      "abstract": "Abstract\r\nStigma is when a certain characteristic (such as weight or race) causes an individual or group to be treated negatively based on a feature that differentiates them from other members of society. Stigma can be considered in different ways; Stigma can be ‘enacted’, when the individual is directly discriminated against, and ‘perceived’, when individual believes the negative actions of others to be linked to an undesirable characteristic of their self. Stigma can have serious consequences, such as reduced quality of life, lower rates of employment and less overall life satisfaction. \r\nEpilepsy is a reasonably common neurological disorder where individuals experience seizures. Over 500,000 UK residents are estimated to be affected by Epilepsy. It can be caused by a number of different factors, such as brain lesions, but there may be no known cause for up to two-thirds of individuals with epilepsy. Historically, seizures have been associated with negative factors, such as demonic possession, and have experienced stigma. There is also evidence that stigmatising attitudes towards seizures continue to be prevalent. Non-epileptic attack disorder (NEAD) is a condition whereby an individual experiences seizures that are outwardly similar to epileptic seizures. These seizures, however, are not associated with the neurological correlates of epilepsy. NEAD is a fairly common disorder with an estimated 15 000 UK residents receiving a diagnosis. The causes of NEAD are often considered psychological rather than physical and, as such, NEAD is often considered a mental health disorder. \r\nThe causes and manifestations of stigma in NEAD are unclear. This project aimed to extend the current understanding of stigma in NEAD by first: reviewing the literature on the experiences of stigma for NEAD and second: investigating the possible underlying factors that may cause perceived stigma in NEAD compared to epilepsy.\r\nPart I describes the outcomes of a systematic narrative review that identified 22 papers investigating the experiences of stigma by individuals diagnosed with NEAD. The results indicate that individuals with NEAD experience stigma from healthcare professionals, the public, and family and friends. Some evidence suggests that individuals with NEAD experience higher rates of stigma than epilepsy. \r\nPart II presents a cross-sectional study that investigate the relationship between perceived stigma and self-efficacy, depression, anxiety and seizure symptom severity in 2 groups (epilepsy and NEAD). The study found individuals with NEAD report more perceived stigma than those with epilepsy and higher, clinical, levels of depression. The severity of symptoms was not associated with perceived stigma for NEAD but it was with epilepsy. Depression was significant predictive factor for perceived stigma in both epilepsy and NEAD.\r\nThese studies develop the current understanding of stigma in NEAD and epilepsy. The findings suggest individuals with NEAD experience more stigma than those with Epilepsy and that depression predicts perceived stigma for other groups. The findings also suggest that stigma may be a useful target for future interventions for individuals with NEAD.",

RLS can be disabling, is sometimes resistant to treatment, and has a significant negative impact on patients' quality of life. Serious sleep disturbances are frequently associated with RLS. Most patients have a family history of RLS, and several gene mutations have been identified. Alterations in iron and dopamine metabolism in the brain has had been implicated in its pathogenesis. RLS can be primary or secondary to iron deficiency, pregnancy, kidney failure, and a variety of environmental and iatrogenic factors. The first-line pharmacologic treatment is dopamine agonist drugs, and a positive response to dopaminergic therapy supports the diagnosis of RLS. Benzodiazepines, gabapentin and its derivatives, and opioids also may be efficacious. Other pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments might be helpful.",

The development of post-traumatic psychopathology depends on individual vulnerability, both genetic and acquired, the nature and severity of the traumatic event, and the quality of the post-traumatic environment. Children who are the victims of abuse or neglect may be particularly profoundly affected by their experience. Even if the stress is only relatively small, if the trauma occurs at a sensitive or critical period of psychological development, a child's cognitive or emotional functioning may not progress normally. The psychopathology of severe personality disorder may thus originate at an early age. Adults who have previously experienced such traumaticevents and who are then involved in later traumatic incidents may be particularly susceptible subsequently to manifest severe psychological disorder. However, even if there is no pre-existing vulnerability, severe trauma can lead to the development of the full range of abnormal psychological symptoms in someone who was previously healthy.",

This type of self-mutilation is the focus of biological research or endorphins and on dopamine receptors. Skin cutting and burning, the most common type of self-mutilation, is often associated with personality disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, and multiple personality disorder. When cutting and burning become established as responses to disturbing psychological symptoms on environmental events, a specific Axis I impulse disorder known as Repetitive Self Mutilation may be diagnosed. Patients with this newly identified syndrome may alternate their direct acts of self-mutilation with eating disorders and episodic alcoholism.",

TK, especially the convinced subtype of TK (c-TK; also known as the offensive subtype of TK), is described as a culture-bound syndrome similar to SAD. In proposed DSM-5 draft, it is suggested to add \"offending others\" to fear of being humiliating or embarrassing which were indicated in DSM-IV. It is interesting that fearing of making another person uncomfortable or \"offending others\" is consistent with symptom which has been investigated through c-TK in particular.

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia and related psychoses is primarily characterized by positive and negative symptoms, as well as cognitive disturbances. Cognitive factors crucial in the pathogenesis of psychosis are specifically studied in terms of cognitive biases that may play a role in the formation and maintenance of psychotic symptoms. Cognitive biases refer to systematic errors in both cognitive processing and content that deviate from logical thinking. Cognitive biases can affect attention, decision-making/reasoning, memory recall, motivation or even attributional style. Psychotic-like experiences and psychotic disorders have been associated with a tendency to jump to conclusions, bias against disconfirmatory evidence and bias against confirmatory evidence as well as liberal acceptance bias. Moreover, patients with schizophrenia tend to present higher belief inflexibility in comparison to healthy individuals and are overconfident in wrong judgments. In the monitoring tasks showing they show a higher tendency to misattribute internally-generated stimuli to external sources (externalizing bias) (1). Finally, patients with schizophrenia tend to have excessive attention toward irrelevant, neutral or familiar stimuli known as the salience aberrant bias. There are several specific psychological interventions designed to ameliorate cognitive biases, such as Metacognitive Training (2,3), Thinking Well (4), Social Cognition and Interaction Training (5). These trainings have been shown to teach patients about cognitive biases and how they contribute to symptoms of psychosis and consequently how they can affect their daily life. There is an increasing number of studies showing results of these interventions in reducing cognitive biases and positive symptoms as well as improving clinical and cognitive insight.",

      "abstract": "Apresentacao: A Esquizofrenia e um transtorno psiquiatrico complexo de evolucao cronica, caracterizado por uma alteracao cerebral que dificulta o correto julgamento sobre a realidade, tendo sintomas classificados como positivos (por exemplo, alucinacoes e delirios) ou negativos (dificuldades de expressar sentimentos e emocoes e pobreza no discurso). E subdividida em cinco tipos: hebefrenica, paranoide, catatonica, residual e indiferenciada. Neste estudo abordaremos a Esquizofrenia Hebefrenica. A Esquizofrenia Hebefrenica, tambem conhecida como desorganizada, e caracterizada por uma acentuada regressao de comportamento, tendo como principais sinais e sintomas estao a infantilidade, discurso incoerente, enfraquecimento intelectual, perturbacao dos afetos, ideias delirantes, alucinacoes, pensamento desorganizado, gesticulacao exagerada, comportamento irresponsavel e imprevisivel, com tendencia ao isolamento social. Geralmente, comeca a ser percebida dos 15 aos 25 anos de idade. A causa ainda nao e totalmente definida, mas hoje sabe-se que se trata de uma doenca quimica cerebral que decorre de alteracoes nos varios sistemas bioquimicos, que sao os neurotransmissores, e vias neuronais cerebrais. Nessa conjuntura, o presente trabalho faz uma analise acerca do diagnostico de Esquizofrenia Hebefrenica de uma jovem assistida pelo Centro de Atencao Psicossocial Infanto Juventil de Imperatriz – MA e tem por objetivo conhecer o contexto da Esquizofrenia Hebefrenica, compreendendo os fatores que ocasionam influencia sobre a mesma, alem de conhecer a realidade da pessoa com Esquizofrenia Hebefrenica, bem como contexto familiar e alteracoes sociais que esta pode vim a causar, entender o processo de acompanhamento e tratamento da paciente realizado pela equipe multiprofissional do CAPS IJ, com destaque para a Enfermagem e elaborar problemas e intervencoes, visando a melhora na qualidade de vida da paciente. Desenvolvimento: O estudo realizado e descritivo, do tipo relato de caso, pois segundo Parente (2010), tem como caracteristica a descricao detalhada, contendo caracteristicas importantes sobre sinais, sintomas e outras caracteristicas do paciente e relata os procedimentos terapeuticos utilizados, bem como o deslanche do caso. A coleta de dados foi realizada no Centro de Atencao Psicossocial Infanto Juvenil - CAPS IJ, na cidade de Imperatriz – MA, no dia 27 de Setembro de 2017, com observacao da consulta de Enfermagem com a mae e revisao do prontuario da paciente, entrevista direta com a enfermeira e assistente social da unidade, e ainda com busca eletronica e literaria, incluindo artigos cientificos na lingua portuguesa, para uma abrangente revisao. Foi consultado o prontuario da mesma a fim de compreender as principais causas do ocorrido e propor intervencoes para melhor qualidade de vida. Para a construcao dos diagnosticos/problemas e intervencoes de enfermagem foi utilizado o NANDA 2015-2017 e NIC, para estudos de medicacoes utilizou-se o AME e manual da ANVISA. Resultados: Com a busca desenvolvida, acerca das informacoes e historico da paciente soube-se que a mesma possui 20 Anos, e estudante, reside na cidade de Imperatriz – MA, com pais divorciados e uma irma com 15 anos, foi diagnosticada em 2013, aos 15 anos, com Esquizofrenia Hebefrenica (CID 10 F20.1). A mae da paciente relata que teve parto normal de 7 meses, porem laborioso – ocorrido na recepcao do hospital, tendo em decorrencia deficiencia na oxigenacao cerebral (hipoxia neonatal) e convulsao. A paciente teve crescimento retardado, veio a andar apenas com 3 anos e falou as primeiras palavras com 4 anos de idade, mas apresentava boa socializacao. Apresenta retardo mental, relata a equipe multiprofissional do CAPSIJ que ouve vozes, ve um homem com capa preta, tem delirios, convulsoes, dificuldade no controle dos esfincteres, apresenta alteracoes na compreensao, alteracoes no humor, dificuldade motora, fala desconexa, em contexto fora da realidade, relata que nunca viu o pai, informacao que, segundo a mae, nao e verdadeira. Fala em namoro, mas de forma infantilizada, grita muito, nao tem paciencia em escutar, possui baixo nivel de atencao e gosta de pintar e ouvir musicas, se ocupando assim, por vezes, durante o dia inteiro. A paciente iniciou acompanhamento apos inicio dos primeiros sintomas na Associacao de Pais e Amigos dos Excepcionais – APAE, tendo de inicio as seguintes hipoteses diagnosticas: Epilepsia (CID 10 G40), Retardo Mental moderado (CID 10 F71), Transtornos Mentais e Comportamentais associados ao puerperio (CID 10 F53), Transtorno Psicotico Agudo e Transitorio (CID 10 F23) e Esquizofrenia (CID 10 F20). Em seguida foi encaminhada ao CAPS IJ onde em 2013, aos 15 anos, L.G.S foi diagnosticada com Esquizofrenia do tipo Hebefrenica (CID 10 F20.1) e iniciou acompanhamento e tratamento com  equipe multiprofissional da Unidade, com atendimentos psiquiatrico, com nutricionista, enfermeira, assistente social e psicologa, e atualmente tambem participa de oficinas de arte e teatro, que a paciente relata que gosta, mas tem aversao aos grupos de adolescentes, pois diz que sao mais velhos e a mesma prefere se relacionar com criancas. Atualmente, tendo 20 anos e com tratamento medicamentoso, acompanhamento com equipe multiprofissional e participacao em oficinas, obteve melhora do quadro, melhora na socializacao, o que possibilitou tambem diminuicao na medicacao, passando a ser iniciado com a mesma o processo de alta da Unidade de Atendimento, com comparecimento da paciente de 15 em 15 dias para interacao social e acompanhamento com a equipe ate que esteja pronta para a alta. Fez-se levantamento das medicacoes utilizadas pela paciente e de diagnosticos de Enfermagem, como: • Atividade de recreacao deficiente, caracterizado pelo tedio, relacionado a atividades de recreacao insuficientes. confusao aguda, controle de impulsos ineficaz, comunicacao verbal prejudicada•            Interacao social prejudicada, caracterizada por funcao social prejudicada, interacao disfuncional com outras pessoas, relacionado ao conhecimento insuficiente para de como fortalecer a reciprocidade, disturbio no autoconceito, isolamento terapeutico e processos de pensamento perturbados, sindrome de estresse por mudanca, risco de automutilacao e risco de violencia direcionada a si mesmo. Fez se tambem o levantamento de intervencoes, que foram: Aplicar arteterapia, praticar musicoterapia, estipular terapia socioambiental, utilizar brinquedos terapeuticos e administrar medicacao quando prescrito. Consideracoes Finais: Em suma, o referido estudo possibilitou como ferramenta fundamental para conhecimento na pratica em relacao as principais alteracoes e especificidades de um paciente com Esquizofrenia Hebefrenica, trazendo um olhar critico para a importância da equipe de enfermagem nos cuidados e acompanhamento do paciente acometido, assim abrindo a concepcao para uma analise sobre a patologia, alem disso, possibilitou a capacidade de realizar uma pesquisa cientifica em bases de dados e literaria, que e primordial para a formacao academica.",

      "abstract": "Neurodevelopmental motor disorders are a group of conditions characterized by developmental deficits in learning, control, and execution of motor skills. The pathophysiology of these cognitive–motor dysfunctions involves complex neuronal processes of sensorimotor integration (that is, somatosensory, proprioceptive, visual, and vestibular), as well as motor control pathways (that is, cortico-basal ganglia, cerebello-thalamo-cortical, and intracortical networks). The most common neurodevelopmental motor disorders are tic disorders (including Tourette’s syndrome), stereotypic motor disorder, and developmental co-ordination disorder. Here, the chapter provides a useful clinical guide regarding the phenomenology, pathogenesis, and management of these conditions.",

      "title": "Estado de salud oral y necesidades de tratamiento en una población de paralíticos cerebrales de Sevilla",
      "abstract": "La paralisis cerebral (PC) es una disfuncion motora central no progresiva del individuo, con unos cambios apreciables del tono muscular, los cuales van a poder ir acompanados de un deficit psiquico y otras alteraciones, ademas de una limitacion de la actividad. Aunque el trastorno no es progresivo, sus manifestaciones clinicas cambian en el tiempo. La paralisis cerebral (PC) describe un grupo de trastornos del desarrollo del movimiento y la postura, causando limitacion de actividad, que se atribuyen, de forma no progresiva, a disturbios que se produjeron en el desarrollo del cerebro fetal o infantil. Los trastornos motores de la paralisis cerebral estan a menudo acompanados de alteraciones de la cognicion, la comunicacion, la percepcion y / o del comportamiento, y / o un trastorno convulsivo. Esta definicion se obtiene de un Workshop Internacional del 2004 e incluye alteraciones del desarrollo (1). Es la causa mas frecuente en la infancia de discapacidad motora y posee una incidencia de 1 de cada 500 nacidos vivos (2). Existe otra relacion, del estudio de Odding y colaboradores, que la situa en una incidencia de 2 a 3 de cada 1000 nacidos vivos (3). Cabe senalar del estudio, que en los paises en vias de desarrollo esta relacion se mantiene, incluso, en algunos casos, es menor que en los paises desarrollados. Esta enfermedad esta causada por un dano cerebral que ocurrio prenatalmente, durante el nacimiento o periodo postnatal, antes de que el sistema nervioso central alcanzara su desarrollo total. Una serie de factores de riesgo estan implicados en el desarrollo de paralisis cerebral (4): • Prenatales: hipoxia, desordenes geneticos, desordenes metabolicos, gestacion multiple, infeccion intrauterina, desordenes trombofilicos, exposicion teratogenica, corioamnionitis, fiebre materna, exposicion a toxinas, malformaciones de estructuras cerebrales, restriccion del crecimiento intrauterino, trauma abdominal, danos vasculares. El 70-80% de los casos de paralisis cerebral se atribuye a factores de riesgo prenatales. • Perinatales: parto prematuro ( • Postnatales: asfixia, convulsiones en periodo postnatal, infarto cerebral, hiperbilirrubinemia, sepsis, sindrome de dificultad respiratoria, enfermedad pulmonar cronica, meningitis, esteroides postnatales, hemorragia intraventricular, leucomalacia periventricular, sindrome del nino sacudido, lesiones en la cabeza. No siempre es posible determinar una causa exacta en determinados casos. Aproximadamente el 30 % de los mismos no tienen ningun factor de riesgo asociado. El parto prematuro, especialmente asociado a bajo peso al nacer ( El grado de complicacion y los sintomas clinicos de los pacientes dependen de la extension y ubicacion de dano que se produce en el sistema nervioso central. Dependiendo de la perturbacion motora existen distintas alteraciones que pueden englobarse en: a) Espastica: tension muscular aumentada con un reflejo de estiramiento exagerado. Sus causas suelen ser anoxia o prematuridad y se asocian frecuentemente con dano o defecto dentro de la zona motora piramidal. Es la mas comun con un 70-80% de los casos (5) b) Discinetica: movimientos incontrolados, involuntarios y sin coordinacion, tanto del cuerpo, cara y extremidades. Incluye hipotonia, atetosis (retorcerse lentamente) y control de la postura anormal. Existen babeos y defectos del habla. El causante es el dano del ganglio basal o de las neuronas motoras profundas. Es el segundo mas frecuente despues de la espasticidad, con un 10-15%. c) Ataxica: trastornos en equilibrio postural y movimientos voluntarios. Esta causada por un dano en las neuronas del cerebelo y representa un 5% aproximadamente. d) Rigidez: afecta a la actividad concurrente de los musculos en contraccion y sus antagonistas, apareciendo movimientos disminuidos. e) Tremor: movimientos involuntarios donde los musculos flexores y extensores siguen un patron ritmico. f) Atonia – hipotonia: falta de tono o tension muscular, los musculos estan debiles y blandos. g) Mixtos: en estos casos coexisten mas de un trastorno motor, son individuos con un dano cerebral o bien mayor o bien mas difuso. (6) La clasificacion de un grupo de individuos tan heterogeneo como la PC es dificil y puede enfocarse desde distintos puntos de vista, todos ellos relevantes. En funcion de: la etiologia, tipo de trastorno predominante, extension de la afectacion, gravedad de la afectacion, trastornos asociados o la neuroimagen. (7) La PC puede ser subclasificada de acuerdo a la topografia, que depende de las extremidades que se ven envueltas (4): a) Cuadriplegia o tetraparesia espastica: estan afectadas las cuatro extremidades, el tronco y la musculatura orofacial. Esto representa el 10 al 15% de los casos de paralisis cerebral espastica. La mayoria de estos individuos presentan un trastorno mental, ademas del trastorno motor. Ademas, poseen un alto riesgo de convulsiones y alteraciones sensoriales. Este tipo de PC se ha asociado a la asfixia en todos los ninos y a hemorragia intraventricular severa en recien nacidos prematuros. b) Diplegia: corresponde al 30-40% de los casos de PC espastica y se caracteriza por las espasticidad en las piernas. Pueden verse afectados los brazos, pero en menor medida. Aproximadamente el 30% de estas personas tienen discapacidad intelectual o dificultades en el aprendizaje. La mayoria son capaces de deambular o desplazarse de forma independiente o con un poco de ayuda. El 50% aproximadamente estan asociados al parto prematuro. c) Hemiplegia: representa el 20 al 30% de los casos de PC espastica. Esta comprometido solo un lado del cuerpo. Usualmente, esta mas danado que la pierna. Mas del 60% de estos individuos tienen un desarrollo intelectual normal y pueden desenvolverse sin asistencia. Tienen un riesgo elevado de padecer convulsiones parciales. Este tipo esta asociado a malformaciones vasculares en el cerebro y hemorragia intraventricular limitada en la primera infancia. d) Monoplegia: Esta condicion es extremadamente rara. Solo un miembro esta afectado, un brazo o una pierna. Estas situaciones se diagnostican precozmente cuando son mas graves. En cuanto mas leve sea, sera mucho mas dificil de identificar por los padres y por el personal sanitario. Muchas veces, este diagnostico se realiza por la exclusion de otras patologias, como causas degenerativas, metabolicas o desordenes geneticos, que tienen presentaciones clinicas similares a la paralisis cerebral. Las complicaciones medicas asociadas son (8): • Espasticidad • Contracturas musculares y desalineacion secundaria a la espasticidad muscular • Dislocacion de cadera • Desordenes de la columna vertebral • Osteoporosis • Discapacidad intelectual (30-50%) • Convulsiones • Reflujo gastroesofagico • Disfagia o afagia • Malnutricion • Perdida de pelo • Los problemas gastrointestinales se dan en un 90% en los ninos con paralisis cerebral (9). En cuanto a los problemas odontoestomatologicos podemos observar que en ellos prevalece mas que en la poblacion normal la hipoplasia del esmalte de los dientes primarios (10, 11). Ademas, poseen mas probabilidad de tener enfermedad periodontal en la denticion primaria que el resto de la poblacion (12). Hay que tener en cuenta, que ademas de la enfermedad periodontal, tambien tienen mas probabilidades de tener caries (13, 14). Presentan una funcion anormal de la lengua, labios y carrillos, lo que provoca problemas en la erupcion y oclusion; debidos principalmente a los problemas neuromusculares inherentes a la paralisis cerebral (5). Ademas, presentan problemas en el crecimiento, lo que puede alterar el desarrollo de los maxilares y, por tanto, de la posicion de los dientes en el arco dentario. Por esta misma razon, hay un patron anormal de deglucion, teniendo que consumir en la mayoria de los casos alimentos blandos con gran aporte de hidratos de carbono que son faciles de tragar y que conllevan que se adhieran y la posterior dificultad de su retirada por la pobre higiene oral, que se debe en muchos casos a la incapacidad para controlar la funcion muscular (15). Tambien es debido a la discinesia, a reflejos orales patologicos (morder, vomitar), incapacidad de manipular un cepillo dental (5). Todo esto hace que sea de vital importancia la destreza de los odontologos en el manejo de personas con discapacidades, tanto fisicas como psiquicas (16). Esta combinacion de alimentos liquidos y ricos en carbohidratos hace que, sobre todo los mas jovenes, tengan un elevado indice de caries (14). En el atetoide y en el espastico hay un bruxismo intenso que puede llevar a un cierre de la mordida y problemas de la articulacion temporomandibular, ademas del desgaste que se produce en estos casos. Lobbezoo y Naije tienen la hipotesis de que los habitos de bruxismo en estas poblaciones estan relacionadas con problemas con la funcion de la dopamina y no regulado por factores locales, tales como la maloclusion (17). Pocos estudios se han publicado que demuestren una tasa de exito en el tratamiento de bruxismo en poblaciones que tienen una discapacidad intelectual (18). Se establece un porcentaje muy elevado de maloclusiones entre este tipo de pacientes, sobre todo de la clase II de Angle. Tambien se contempla un aumento del resalte de los incisivos superiores, lo que puede estar ligado a un aumento de traumatismo dental. Tambien esta descrita la asociacion de clase II con mordida abierta debida principalmente a una posicion mas anterior de la lengua, provocado por un reflejo de deglucion alterado y, con frecuencia, respiracion oral (19).",

      "title": "Trauma",
      "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the result of head injury due to various causes which leads to damage of the brain, brain stem, spinal cord, cranial nerves, and arteries. Symptoms encountered in traumatic brain injury are manifold and include among others vomiting, dizziness and balance problems, lethargy, breathing problems, headache, and paralysis. Classification of TBI relies on clinical aspects, clinical/neuroradiological aspects, neuropathological aspects, and mechanistic aspects. The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) has been used for decades to classify TBI on clinical grounds. Severity of TBI can be mild, moderate, or severe. Mechanistically, impact injury, acceleration-deceleration injury, penetrating injury, and blast injury are distinguished. On MR imaging, hemorrhagic or non-hemorrhagic edematous lesions are typically located in the anterior inferior frontal lobes and temporal poles. Coup-contrecoup injury describes brain damage located at the site of impact and on the opposite side of the brain. Focal injuries (scalp lesions, skull lesions, contusions and lacerations as well as intracranial hemorrhages) are distinguished from diffuse injuries (diffuse axonal injury (DAI), ischemia, brain swelling, and diffuse vascular injury). In DAI, eosinophilic swellings as sign of damaged axons are seen as well as abnormal axons. Axonal flow disruption is detected by immunohistochemistry for amyloid precursor protein (APP). Pathogenetic mechanisms include primary axotomy and mechanoporation. Chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) is a progressive neurological deterioration resulting from repetitive brain trauma (sports: boxing, American football, soccer, ice hockey, rugby, blast injuries, other neurotrauma). Behavioral changes, mood changes, memory loss, cognitive impairment, and dementia are seen in these patients. Perivascular foci of p-tau immunoreactive neurofibrillary tangles, pre-tangles, and dot-like and thread-like neurites are found in the neocortex. Clusters of subpial astrocytic tangles are seen in the cerebral cortex as well as subependymal astrocytic tangles in the periventricular region of the lateral ventricles, periaqueductal gray, and lateral brain stem. Pathogenetic mechanisms include microtubule disruption, membrane leakage, glutamate excitotoxicity, lactate storm, tauopathy, immunoexcitotoxicity, and hemodynamic alterations. Treatment includes emergency treatment, surgery, and post-surgical treatment. Outcome depends on Glasgow Outcome Scale and gene polymorphisms.",

      "abstract": "Alien motor phenomena arise in neurological and psychiatric contexts and are likely to implicate several distributed brain systems.A selective literature review, focusing on cognitive neurobiological accounts of alien/anarchic limb, somatoparaphrenia, and delusions of alien control (passivity phenomena); supplemented by an account of the cognitive neuroanatomy of action and agency (subjective sense of causation) in the normal state.Alien motor phenomena reflect impairments of agency through at least two mechanisms. (1) A disinhibition of ''lower'' motor centres giving rise to relatively stereotypic and contextually inappropriate motor routines (as emerge following medial frontal and corpus callosal lesions). (2) A disturbance of the perception of self-initiated movement, so that control of movement (causation) is attributed to an alien entity (phenomena associated with right parietal lobe lesions, focal epilepsy, and hyperactivity in acute schizophrenia).Whereas alien/anarchic limb dysfunction may be relatively easily explained in cognitive neurobiological terms, a comprehensive account of alien control will require further empirical ingenuity. Current models invoke disturbed feed-forward mechanisms, imitation, and the sense of another's agency (''nonself attribution'').",

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV) defines dementia as an acquired impairment of cognitive function that includes a decline in memory beyond what would be expected for age and at least one other cognitive function, such as attention, visuospatial skills or language, or a decline in executive functioning such as planning, organization, sequencing, or abstracting. The decline cannot only affect emotional abilities, but must also interfere with work or social activities. The deficits should not be accompanied by an impairment of arousal (delirium) or be accounted for by another psychiatric condition, such as depression or schizophrenia. Dementia can further be defined by a possible, probable, or definite etiologic diagnosis. A degenerative dementia implies disease progression over time.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:\r\nSpinal cord injury (SCI) is a partial or total disruption of the structural or functional integrity of the spinal cord following non-traumatic or traumatic cause leads to temporary or permanent impairment of motor, sensory and/or autonomic functions. \r\nThe spinal cord functions mainly in the transmission of neural signals between the brain and the target organs in the body but also contains neural circuits that can independently control numerous reflexes and central pattern generators. The disruption of these neurohumoral functions following spinal cord injury results in various acute and chronic secondary complications. There is a wide range of short and long term complications like Heterotopic Ossifications, spasticity, deep venous thrombosis, osteoporosis etc. \r\nHeterotopic ossification (HO) is defined as ‘formation of mature, lamellar bone in non-osseous tissue, usually between the muscle and the joint capsule’. This happens as a consequence of various conditions and trauma. These include neurological injuries like spinal cord injury, traumatic brain injury, post surgical intervention at the particular joint and direct injury to the muscle. \r\nThe exact cause of HO is not clear till date though the research has been well advanced in this field. The widely accepted concept is transformation of primitive mesenchymal cells which are present in the connective tissue into bone forming cells called osteoblasts when exposed to certain inducing agents(1). The exact sequence of events that lead to ectopic bone formation, the proper etiology and predisposing factors are still under exploration. \r\nEarly identification of this particular condition has always been a challenge. As the condition develops over a period of time with non specific complaints at the local site and occasionally mild constitutional symptoms; clinical suspicion needs to be tailored with proper investigation to achieve diagnosis at the earliest. It is well established that the medical treatment is most effective only when the patient receives it before the radiological evidence of bone formation. There are various laboratory biomarkers like alkaline phosphatase(ALP), creatine phosphokinase, osteocalcin and radiological tools including the use of ultra sound examination in early detection of HO have been reported in the literature. Three phase bone scan is widely accepted as Gold standard(2–4). \r\nCurrently pharmacotherapy is the mainstay of treatment for HO. Disodium Etidronate (Didronel), a non nitrogenous bisphosphonate was the drug of choice for both prophylaxis and treatment as it can slow down the mineralization process(5). Didronel is expected to be effective in early stage of the disease(3). Other medications like NSAIDs, Warfarin(6,7), glucocorticoids are also in use. Indomethacin is used most commonly which is shown to be effective in the prevention of HO especially when the patient receives during the first two months after the spinal cord injury even before the clinical features appear(8–10). Low field irradiation showed some response when used as the primary treatment once first clinical signs were observed(11–13). The surgical intervention is the last resort available when the HO becomes fully mature. The complication rate is high for the surgical resection which includes increased bleeding and recurrence. \r\nAIM OF THE STUDY: \r\nEarly detection of heterotopic ossification in spinal cord injury patients through biomarkers. \r\nOBJECTIVES:\r\n1. To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of CPK in early detection of heterotopic ossification in spinal cord injury patients. \r\n2. To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of osteocalcin in early detection of heterotopic ossification in spinal cord injury patients. \r\n3. To compare serum CPK, osteocalcin levels in early detection of heterotopic ossification following spinal cord injury. \r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS:\r\nStudy design:\r\nProspective, diagnostic pilot study in a spinal cord injury patients’ cohort group. \r\nSetting for the study: \r\nThe study was done in the Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (PM&R) of Christian Medical College Hospital (CMCH), Vellore. CMCH Vellore is a tertiary care centre located in Tamil Nadu, India. This centre has an inpatient capacity of about 2,700 beds. The number of patients attending OPD each day is approximately 5000. The PM&R department of CMCH, Vellore has approximately 130 beds and its outpatient department serves around 100 patients every day. Nearly 300 patients with spinal cord injury are rehabilitated in a year. Around 20-40% of these admissions are diagnosed to have heterotopic ossification. \r\nThis study was approved by the Institutional Review Board and Ethics committee of Christian Medical College and Hospital, Vellore. \r\nParticipants:\r\nIndividuals with paraplegia and quadriplegia secondary to traumatic spinal cord injury classified as ASIA-A, ASIA-B, ASIA-C and ASIA-D from January 2013 to June 2014were involved in the study. \r\nInclusion criteria: \r\n18-60yr old male and female patients after 3 weeks of spinal cord injury attending outpatient and inpatient sections of Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation, Emergency Department and Department of Spinal disorders of Christian Medical College Hospital, Vellore were included in this study after informed consent. \r\nExclusion criteria: \r\n1. Patients with recent history (one week) of medical/surgical conditions which tend to raise the serum levels of ALP or CPK such as rhabdomyolysis, muscular dystrophy, myoscitis, myocardial infarction, myocarditis, hypothyroidism, severe orthopedic trauma, disorders of bile duct obstruction, celiac disease, muscle hematomas, or organ tear were excluded from the study. \r\n2. Patients with existing ossification around hip joints/ bone pathology at the time of initial screening by pelvis X- ray were not included. \r\n3. Individuals who have had hip fracture after the recruitment which is radiologically proven were excluded from the study. \r\n4. Children and pregnant women were also excluded. \r\nMethodology:\r\nALP, CPK and Osteocalcin were measured at around 3rd, 7th, 11th and 16th week of the injury. Osteocalcin samples are stored under -70°C to prevent the wastage of the reagent kit till the end of the study. Base line hip x-ray was checked for every patient at the time of recruitment. All the blood samples were tested as per the standard operating procedures mentioned in the annexure. We interpreted the biomarker values as per the reference ranges established in CMCH Vellore Laboratory. The images of the reference standard i.e. Triple phase Technetium-99m bone scan were interpreted by nuclear medicine physician. The test results were not interpreted using clinical data from participants. \r\nStatistical Analysis:\r\nThe final results were compared and analyzed with two sided Fisher Exact test using SPSS software. We found there is no significant correlation of CPK values at different weeks with the later developing heterotopic ossification in the four patients and ALP values at different weeks showed there is no specific co relation with the HO that was noticed after 16weeks. \r\nCONCLUSIONS;\r\n1. CPK may not be a good early biochemical marker for diagnosing the HO in spinal cord injury patients. The rising trend may not be observed in all patients who develop HO implying its poor quality to assess the HO maturity. \r\n2. ALP can be serially monitored to check the osteoblastic activity only in the context of absence of bone injury. Interpretation of ALP values in first four months of the injury should be done carefully. \r\n3. Osteocalcin in spinal cord injury patients is not a good tool in predicting the future developing HO.",

      "title": "Influencia de la fatiga en la calidad de movimiento de personas con lesión medular",
      "abstract": "La fatiga es un fenomeno fisiologico complejo por el que se limita la capacidad del individuo para mantener una actividad fisica concreta (Bigland-Ritchie y Woods, 1984). En individuos sanos el desarrollo de la fatiga esta ligado al ejercicio fisico siendo la causa principal que limita la duracion del mismo. Ademas, la fatiga aparece como parte de la patologia de diferentes enfermedades y su efecto es igualmente limitador de la actividad fisica. El estudio de un fenomeno tan complejo se ha realizado con distintos abordajes experimentales y en distintos niveles fisiologicos con individuos sanos, lo que ha permitido distinguir tres tipos basicos de fatiga: a) fatiga periferica, producida en el sistema neuro-muscular, b) fatiga sistemica producida por la respuesta neuro-endocrina, c) fatiga central que se produce en el sistema nervioso central (Taylor y Gandevia, 2008; Zwartz et al, 2008). Una lesion medular (LM) es un dano del sistema nervioso central (SNC), tanto de las vias motoras y reguladoras del movimiento, de las vias sensoriales o ascendentes, como de importantes circuitos del sistema nervioso autonomo. La alteracion de estas estructuras a medio y largo plazo genera modificaciones fisiologicas tanto en la corteza cerebral sensoriomotora (dolor neuropatico, miembro fantasma, etc) como en la medula espinal (espasticidad, hiperreflexia, dolor neuropatico, hyperreflexia simpatica etc). Las personas con LM (PLM) sufren una fatiga general (Fawkes-Kirby et al 2007 ; Anton et al 2008) asociada a su enfermedad. Por lo tanto una LM debe modificar el desarrollo y/o la intensidad de la fatiga central, lo cual no se ha estudiado hasta la actualidad. \nLas posibles causas de la excesiva fatiga central en el lesionado medular pueden ser de origen nervioso pero tambien de origen sistemico. La disautonomia de los pacientes lesionados medulares puede provocar una alteracion de los mecanismos homeostaticos sistemicos de la temperatura, electrolitos, etc y asi producir una excesiva fatiga cental tambien por encima del nivel de lesion. Asi que un estudio comparado de la fatiga central en individuos sanos y en individuos con lesion medular (a nivel supralesional) podria aportar conocimientos sobre el problema general de la fatiga central y en particular de los cambios a nivel central que un dano medular produce en las personas. \nEn este sentido, el uso de tecnicas no invasivas para estimulacion y registro del SNC ha permitido avanzar en el estudio de la fatiga central (Di Lazzaro, Oliviero et al 2003, Racinais et al 2007). Estas nuevas tecnicas, junto a las clasicas de electromiografia de superficie permiten, sobre todo a nivel de la corteza cerebral y en la medula espinal, evaluar la participacion del SNC en el desarrollo de la fatiga para ayudar a generar conocimiento en torno a como la enfermedad puede afectar la calidad de movimiento. \nEn base al marco teorico que estudiamos, la hipotesis inicial que se establecio fue que el comportamiento de los mecanismos de desarrollo de la fatiga central en personas con LM cursarian de forma diferente a los desarrollados por personas sanas sin patologias durante tareas de tipo agudo. Como hipotesis secundaria se senalo que para la misma tarea propuesta, la fatiga medida por via periferica en personas con LM presentaria valores similares o incluso inferiores que las personas sin lesion. \nPara lograr dar respuesta a las hipotesis planteadas, el objetivo principal de la tesis fue describir la influencia que la fatiga tiene en la calidad de movimiento de PLM a traves del estudio de los mecanismos de desarrollo de la fatiga central y periferica durante una CMV en personas con LM frente al comportamiento de los mismos en personas sin discapacidad (GC) y el objetivo secundario se centro en establecer criterios objetivos que cuantifiquen y describieran los mecanismos de desarrollo de la fatiga central y periferica en poblacion con LM a traves del estudio del SN.\nEn este sentido y tras llevar a cabo la fase experimental de la presente Tesis Doctoral, el analisis de resultados y su posterior discusion, se confirman ambas hipotesis, cumpliendo en su desarrollo tanto con la ejecucion del objetivo principal como del secundario. Las conclusiones a las que se han alcanzado tras la discusion de resultados son:\n• La fatiga no tiene aparentemente ninguna influencia de tipo negativo en la calidad de movimiento de PLM a traves del estudio de los mecanismos de desarrollo de la fatiga central y periferica durante una CMV en personas con LM frente al comportamiento de los mismos en personas sin discapacidad (GC).\n• Las PLM presentan menor fatiga tanto por via central como por via periferica frente al GC, resultando incluso significativamente inferior la fatiga central que las PLM presentan tras el esfuerzo con respecto a la manifestada por el GC.\n• Sin embargo, los mecanismos de desarrollo de la fatiga tanto por via cortical como periferica cursan de forma diferente en PLM frente a las personas sin discapacidad (GC).\n• La respuesta que las PLM obtienen tras el test de isometria continua propuesto, tiende a ser significativamente aumentada con respecto a la normalidad, registrandose tras la CMV una sobreactivacion tanto de las vias corticales como de las espinales.\n• Las personas con LM inferior a D6 son capaces de producir valores de fuerza similares al GC en acciones que impliquen la FPM.\n• La fatiga cronica descrita en la poblacion con LM podria deberse a la sobreactivacion que actividades de corta duracion y alta intensidad como las que se dan en sus actividades de la vida diaria sobre la SR provocan tanto a nivel cortical como periferico.",

      "abstract": "Regular physical activity affects most organs and tissues through a large number of mechanisms which in various ways contribute to improved function and health. Regular physical activity improves quality of life, cognitive functions, mood state and physical capacity, and lowers the risk of many diseases and premature death. Physical activity affects proteins and gene expression through signalling mechanisms, e.g. epigenetic changes. The biological response to physical activity can be markedly different between individuals, to a large degree due to genetic mechanisms. Regular aerobic physical activity (endurance training) improves cardiac function, partly due to an increased stroke volume, and lowers blood pressure due to e.g. improved vasodilation, lower arterial stiffness and increased capillarisation. Regular physical activity helps to maintain muscle mass and function and can improve brain health and function, e.g. executive and memory functions.",

The neuroanatomy remains poorly defined but three levels seem likely: a) a cortical level; b) a bulbar, or effector, level; and 3) a synkinetic, or integrative, level probably at or near the hypothalamus. Pathological laughter occurs when laughter is inappropriate, unrestrained (forced), uncontrollable, or dissociated from any stimulus. Pathological laughter is found in three main conditions: a) pseudobulbar palsy; b) gelastic epilepsy; and c) psychiatric illnesses. It is also found in other pathological conditions.

      "title": "Reactive attachment disorder as an evolutionary adaptation",
      "abstract": "This paper suggests that the behaviours associated with the formal diagnosis of the “disinhibited” form of reactive attachment disorder (RAD) might be seen as a functional adaptation rather than a mental health problem, a facultative response enhancing the probability of survival that is triggered by certain conditions. Although disinhibited RAD is most commonly observed in institutionalised children, similar behaviours may also be a part of the emotional difficulties displayed by some fostered and adopted children (the latter includes those once institutionalised), and these may demonstrate not so much a discrete attachment disorder as either the need to fend for oneself following loss of dedicated caregiving or a lack of opportunity to build specific intimate relationships with dedicated caregivers. In many cases this may be inextricably mixed with the neurobiological and psychological seqelae of maltreatment. Indiscriminate attachment behaviour, from this proposed evolutionary perspective, is less a syndrome of mental ill-health than an astute survival manoeuvre following being orphaned, abandoned or fecklessly reared. Such a response, allied to the innate facility to access caregiving from different adults, could be expected to be initiated by specific events as are the other attachment configurations. Classing disinhibited RAD as an adaptation has implications for helping children brought up under extreme duress when their caregiving environment has changed for the better.",

In veterinary forensic science, two common types of forces and resulting traumas are blunt force trauma (BFT) and sharp force trauma. Studies have shown that blunt force trauma can have an effect on the coagulation abilities and processes of animals. Assessment of activated partial thromboplastin time should be considered in the evaluation of animals suffering severe traumatic injuries, as it may be altered in animals suffering from severe BFT. Fractures can be caused by falling or jumping, animal fighting, sports injuries, motor vehicle accidents, and nonaccidental injuries, such as blunt force trauma and gunshots. Caution is advised in using this general guideline to assess the age of a lesion, as the effects of variables such as species variability, incidence of self-trauma, malnutrition, protein deprivation, and disease are not fully known and may be challenged in a court setting.",

      "abstract": "The commonest and simplest operational definition of consciousness is, the state of the patient’s awareness of self and environment and his responsiveness to external stimulation and inner need. Therefore, unconsciousness has the opposite meaning, that is, a state of unawareness of self and environment or a suspension of those mental activities by which people are made aware of themselves and their environment, coupled with a diminished responsiveness to environmental stimuli. Loss of consciousness can have many different causes, for example, stroke, traumatic brain injury, anesthesia, brainstem lesions and sleep, the various causes of unconsciousness primarily interfering with different brain functions. Clinically, impaired consciousness such as coma, vegetative state (VS) and minimally conscious state (MCS) is a very common manifestation in subjects with acquired brain injury. Unconsciousness does not always consist of a general suppression of the entire activity of the central nervous system. Depending on the actual cause(s), many functions, such as protective reflexes and various cognitive processes, can remain intact. The Management of such a patient in VS or MCS requires carefully reaching the correct diagnosis, pronouncing an evidence-based prognosis, and thoughtfully considering the medical, ethical, and legal elements of optimum treatment (Bernat, 2006).",

      "title": "PIK3CA-Related Segmental Overgrowth",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics PIK3CA-associated segmental overgrowth includes disorders of brain (e.g., MCAP [megalencephaly-capillary malformation] syndrome, hemimegalencephaly); and segmental body overgrowth (e.g., CLOVES [congenital lipomatous asymmetric overgrowth of the trunk, lymphatic, capillary, venous, and combined-type vascular malformations, epidermal nevi, skeletal and spinal anomalies] syndrome, fibroadipose hyperplasia [FH]). Heterozygous (usually somatic mosaic) pathogenic variants of PIK3CA are causative. MCAP syndrome is characterized by the major findings of (1) megalencephaly (MEG) or hemimegalencephaly (HMEG) associated with neurologic findings of hypotonia, seizures, and mild to severe intellectual disability; and (2) cutaneous capillary malformations with focal or generalized somatic overgrowth. Additional findings can include digital anomalies (syndactyly, polydactyly), cortical malformations – most distinctively polymicrogyria (PMG); and variable connective tissue dysplasia. CLOVES (or CLOVE) syndrome and fibroadipose hyperplasia (FH) may be associated with (1) MEG or HMEG; and (2) patchy segmental overgrowth associated with skeletal anomalies, lipomatosis, vascular malformations, and epidermal nevi. Diagnosis/testing PIK3CA-associated segmental overgrowth is confirmed in an individual with a pathogenic variant on one PIK3CA allele, typically in affected tissues. Because the vast majority of PIK3CA pathogenic variants arise postzygotic (and are thus mosaic), more than one tissue may need to be tested. Failure to detect a PIK3CA pathogenic variant does not exclude a clinical diagnosis of the PIK3CA-associated segmental overgrowth disorders in individuals with suggestive features. Management Treatment of manifestations: Significant or lipomatous segmental overgrowth may require debulking; scoliosis and leg-length discrepancy may require orthopedic care and surgical intervention. Neurologic complications (e.g., obstructive hydrocephalus, increased intracranial pressure, progressive and/or symptomatic cerebellar tonsillar ectopia or Chiari malformation; epilepsy in those with HMEG) may warrant neurosurgical intervention. Routine treatment of the following, when present, is indicated: cardiac and renal abnormalities; intellectual disabilities and behavior problems; motor difficulties; speech, swallowing, and feeding difficulties. Surveillance: MCAP syndrome: Follow up no less than every six months until age six years and at least yearly thereafter to monitor for neurosurgical complications, breathing or sleep disorders, seizures and orthopedic complications. Provisionally recommended imaging in early childhood includes brain MRI every six months for the first two years, then yearly until age eight years for neurologic complications (e.g., hydrocephalus, cerebellar tonsillar ectopia). Consider screening for Wilms tumor following the protocol suggested for Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) (by ultrasound examination every 3 months until age 8 years); however, tumor risk in PIK3CA-related segmental overgrowth is undetermined and appears to be lower than in BWS. CLOVES syndrome and FH: Monitoring for severe scoliosis, infiltrative lipomatous overgrowth, paraspinal high-flow lesions with spinal cord ischemia, lymphatic malformations, cutaneous vesicles, orthopedic problems, central phlebectasias, and thromboembolism. Genetic counseling PIK3CA-associated segmental overgrowth is not typically inherited. Most affected individuals with MCAP reported to date (21/24) had somatic mosaicism for pathogenic variants in PIK3CA, suggesting that mutation occurred post-fertilization in one cell of the multicellular embryo. Two of 24 affected individuals had a de novo germline pathogenic variant in PIK3CA. All reported individuals with CLOVES and FH had somatic mosaicism for pathogenic variants in PIK3CA. No confirmed instances of vertical transmission or sib recurrence have been reported. Because family members are not known to have an increased risk, prenatal diagnosis is usually not indicated for family members.",

The results of the neuropsychological examination included retrieval anemic deficits with normal recognition, impaired motor dexterity and cognitive flexibility in the presence of normal intelligence. The cognitive-behavioural symptomatology contrasted with a normal neurologic examination.",

Depending on the clinical features and the predominant pattern of production, tremor is classified into resting tremor, postural tremor, and kinetic tremor. Tremor is associated with rhythmic contraction of agonist and antagonist muscles, either alternately or simultaneously. Tremor involving muscles in the resting condition is called resting tremor and is seen most commonly in Parkinson disease. Tremor involving muscles during isometric contraction is called postural tremor, and it is most commonly seen in essential tremor. Tremor involving muscles during intended movements (isotonic contraction) is called kinetic tremor, and it is most commonly seen in a lesion of the cerebellar efferent pathway.",

The term includes a number of variations in type; the affected muscles in many instances are enlarged (pseudohypertrophic) but in others are normal or even atrophic in appearance. The cause of the condition is unknown, but the hereditary and familial occurrence are noteworthy. As its name indicates, the disease is distinguished by progressive weakness of the skeletal musculature, making its appearance, as a rule, in early childhood. The progress is slow in some cases but usually is rapid, and the disease is often fatal in early life. Unpreventable deformities of the extremities frequently interfere with walking long before the actual loss of muscle power would prevent locomotion. The pathologic effects of the disease appear",

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) develops following exposure to actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual assault. Intrusions, distressing dreams, dissociative reactions (flashbacks), intense psychological distress, and physiological stress responses at exposure to internal of external cues that symbolize aspects of the traumatic event are typical for PTSD. Behaviourally, PTSD reflects a strategy of defence involving avoidance, attentive immobility, withdrawal, aggressive defence, appeasement, and tonic immobility, some of which are ancient vertebrate heritage. These defence mechanisms are preceded by heightened vigilance and risk assessment. Persistent stress responses often occur when important biosocial goals had been thwarted by the traumatic event. Species with long life-history patterns may be more vulnerable to developing PTSD than species with short life cycles.",

The comorbidity of medical conditions and bipolar affective disorders is a topic that warrants systematic research. Rapid cycling has been reported in various other neuropsychiatric disorders, such as head injury, stroke, learning disability, or rarer illnesses, such as cerebral sarcoidosis or tuberous sclerosis. Rapid-cycling bipolar affective disorders may concur with higher rates of substance-abuse disorders, but such an idea is mainly based on clinical observation or preliminary data. There is an overall tendency that mixed states and rapid-cycling forms of bipolar affective disorder constitute more unfavorable forms of the underlying illness. Mixed affective episodes have a link with anxiety disorders and anxious-dependent personality disorders. Rapid cycling may have a link with substance abuse and with certain neuropsychiatric disorders, or, perhaps, these neuropsychiatric disorders may mimic rapid cycling.",

We present three female adolescents who developed an acute psychosis a few days before menstruation, which resolved completely upon bleeding or several days later, only to reappear in the same form in subsequent cycles. The clinical presentation was not in line with that of the typical functional psychoses. An extensive medical work-up did not show any significant disturbances, with the exception of anovulatory cycles in one youngster. Psychotropic treatment had no effect on the course of the psychosis. Treatment with progesterone in the second half of the cycle in one case, and with a combined progesterone/estrogen contraceptive agent in another, resulted in full recovery within several cycles. The third girl showed a spontaneous remission within four cycles. Remission continued in all cases after discontinuation of the hormonal treatment, and with no need to reintroduce any psychotropic agent, for a period of 2-4 years. We discuss several possible etiologic mechanisms for cyclic psychosis associated with the menstrual cycle, including it being a cycloid non-specific affective disorder, and its association with a temporary functional hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction, and with anovulation. We also discuss the role of psychotropic and hormonal treatment in this disorder.",

TrPs may develop during occupational, recreational, or sports activities when muscle use exceeds muscle capacity and normal recovery is disturbed.",

      "abstract": "1. Understanding disease in the context of a hermeneutic of the ill person's life history forces us to abandon the old understanding of causality which is represented by the model of body-soul polarity. The real onset of an illness has a biographic pre-history. Long latent periods may occur before and between \"functio laesa\" and actual damage to the involved organ. On the basis of psychosomatic case histories, we can conclude that the future-orientation of an individual's life, that for which man must make decisions, is also that which causes the crises situation for those who are suffering. 2. Psychosomatic medicine cannot simply be included in an already existing medical discipline such as, for example, perinatology can be included in gynecology or pediatrics. It implies a whole new understanding of illness and, above all, it requires a new attitude on the part of the physician. The patient must be allowed to cooperate in his self-realization; the physician himself becomes the medicine. 3. An attempt was made to illustrate the concept of \"organ language\" on the basis of 6 brief examples from psychosomatic gynecology. Here only the most important information was presented. According to the concept of \"organ language\", the soma and psyche of the suffering person can represent and interpret each other reciprocally. It also becomes obvious that conflicts at various strata of being can use one and the same physical symptom if a common denominator is present (e.g., defence overagainst a danger, a disease or a role). This type of teleological nosology implies a new dimension for the consideration a disease, namely, the question of the meaning of suffering. 4. The examples cited are almost exclusively found in the understanding of sexuality in the broadest sense of the word. The threat of individuation as the final personality organization resulting from inadequate realization of the individual's own sex determination (Friedrichs) is present. 5. The sixth example clearly illustrates that sexuality is not what it is commonly considered to be. Rather, it permeates all state of personality and extends beyond them into areas of cultural and intellectual life. Whether or not a woman engages in sexual activity is not important (as had originally been thought). What is important is her attitude toward her own sex, toware her sexual activity and, therefore, also toward her partner and the environment. True sexual activity means infinitely more than just the automatic physiological act. In total self-abandonment to the \"Thou\", perfect sexual love becomes a knowing penetration of being. Genesis 4:1 states: \"Now Adam knew Eve his wife...\". The Hebrew word for \"know\" (yada') means both to know and to beget. Through the mystery of this word, something of the perfection, of the \"participation mystique\" in the work of creation becomes transparent in the perfect sexual union of two human beings!",

Pedophiles seek out children in response to their erotic thoughts and urges, whereas exhibitionists expose themselves. Paraphiliac syndromes ordinarily follow a chronic course and may be associated with biological pathology, but etiological factors are poorly understood. Treatment becomes a consideration when the well-being or rights of others are compromised. Proposed treatments have included psychotherapy, behavior therapy, surgery, and medication. Medroxyprogesterone acetate, which reduces testosterone, may diminish sexual preoccupation and urges, making self-control easier.",

Head injury can be caused by both contact loading and non-contact (inertial) loading, that is setting the head in motion. A critical common denominator in assessing the biomechanics of head injury can be found by defining the conditions that cause responses within the head and understanding the combination of external input conditions that produce the conditions. There are a range of variables produced during head loading that can be correlated with head injury risk, which can assist forensic investigation, including acceleration, kinetic energy, force, stress (force per unit area) and strain (change in length [deformation]). Several infant-specific mechanical and computational models have been developed in an attempt to simulate the biomechanics of human-induced shaking of an infant.",

      "abstract": "Muscle Tension Dysphonia-The Untold StoryHuman voice production involves coordinated functioning of the vocal folds and regulated airflow from the lungs to the oropharynx.A synchronized activity of respiratory, phonatory, resonatory and articulatory systems lead to the optimal phonatory outcome.Smaller intrinsic muscles and larger extrinsic muscles need to work in harmony, to produce voice, which is appropriate to age, sex, and society.The excessive tension of the laryngeal or extralaryngeal muscles or both result in suboptimal phonatory function.Muscle tension dysphonia (MTD) is a condition characterized by varying degree of dysphonia and other associated symptoms, primarily due to tension and uncoordinated activity of intrinsic and extrinsic muscles of the larynx.This is generally subdivided into primary and secondary type.In primary MTD, there is no structural or neurological abnormality associated with muscle tension.The secondary type usually occurs as a compensatory mechanism for underlying glottic insufficiency or mucosal lesion.On the other hand, long-term untreated MTD may itself turn out to be a precursor of phonotraumatic mucosal lesion.Earlier, these patients with vocal dysfunction with no apparent structural lesion or neurological dysfunction were stamped under the category of functional voice disorders.Subsequently, extensive work by many authors has led to the understanding of this complex condition.Evolution of classification has also resulted in the addition of a plethora of terminologies to the literature namely hyperfunctional dysphonia, muscle misuse voice disorder, musculoskeletal tension dysphonia, hyperkinetic dysphonia, laryngeal isometric disorder, laryngeal tension fatigue syndrome and many more.Finally, \"muscle tension dysphonia\" has emerged to be the universally accepted nomenclature.Multifactorial etiology of this condition is well established.Anxiety and stress, coupled with vocal abuse and misuse are the major causative factors; personality plays an important role.Besides, compensatory maladaptation for any structural lesion can lead to secondary MTD.An MTD, either primary or secondary is one of the most commonly encountered diagnoses in any voice clinic.Patients may present with a mild degree of hoarseness to extremely strained voice, along with odynophonia.A careful history of vocal demand and usage along with any history of underlying stress often provides diagnostic clue.External neck inspection is of paramount importance to detect the position of larynx and muscle tension during phonation.Palpation of suprahyoid, thyrohyoid and cricothyroid space usually elicits tenderness of specific muscles, even at rest.The endolaryngeal examination should ideally be done with a flexible nasolaryngoscope, to detect supraglottic muscle tension during the larynx in action.Stroboscopy helps identify any associated mucosal lesion leading to MTD.Intrinsic muscle tension at the supraglottic or glottic level is usually graded on the basis of various classifications.Management involves voice therapy which may be indirect or direct.Indirect therapy involves educating patients about healthy phonatory habits and training corrective vocal exercises to release tension.Direct therapy is aimed at releasing musculoskeletal tension to promote healthy phonatory posture.Circumlaryngeal therapy, stretch and flow phonation, vocal function exercises and resonant voice therapy are the common techniques used.Medical treatment of associated problems like laryngopharyngeal reflux and surgical treatment of any structural lesion should be undertaken.Role of EMG-guided botulinum toxin injection is also emerging in recent years.Diagnosis of MTD is simple and straightforward, provided the clinician is aware of this condition.However, there is a need for more comprehensive grading system encompassing both external and endolaryngeal findings.This would help in delivering more tailor-made direct voice therapy to correct tension of specific muscles.Use of botulinum toxin injection is also likely to increase, especially for cases refractory to voice therapy.",

Inability to show dissatisfaction and inhibition of one's own aggressive tendencies are characteristic of depressive neurosis.

These devices can be categorized not only by the modality of stimulation [i.e., auditory, visual, tactile, or direct electrical stimulation of the auditory nerve (auditory-neural)] but also in terms of the degree of speech processing that is used. At least four such categories can be distinguished: assistive devices (a) that are not designed specifically for speech, (b) that take the average characteristics of speech into account, (c) that process articulatory or phonetic characteristics of speech, and (d) that embody some degree of automatic speech recognition. Assistive devices for people with speech and/or language disabilities typically involve some form of speech synthesis or symbol generation for severe forms of language disability. Speech synthesis is also used in text-to-speech systems for sightless persons. Other applications of assistive technology involving voice communication include voice control of wheelchairs and other devices for people with mobility disabilities.",

An exception would be presyncopal light-headedness caused by postural hypotension or cardiac arrhythmia. Patients with psychophysiologic dizziness often report being dizzy from morning to night without changes for months to years at a time. Vertigo is typically aggravated by head movements, whereas nonvestibular dizziness is often aggravated by movement of visual targets. Episodes of dizziness induced by position change suggest a vestibular lesion if postural hypotension has been ruled out. Although stress can aggravate both vestibular and nonvestibular dizziness, dizziness that is reliably precipitated by stress suggests a nonvestibular cause. Finally, episodes of dizziness occurring only in specific situations (e.g., driving on the freeway, entering a crowded room, or shopping in a busy supermarket) suggest a nonvestibular cause.",

      "title": "Cardiovascular Reflexes and Autonomic Neuropathy",
      "abstract": "Clinical features of autonomic neuropathy include postural hypotension, sweating abnormalities, disturbance of body temperature regulation, gastric fullness and nausea, intermittent nocturnal diarrhoea, constipation, bladder problems and impotence. In diabetic patients, gustatory sweating and hypoglycaemic unawareness also sometimes occur (Johnson &amp; Spalding, 1974). The onset of symptoms is usually insidious and permanent, but may occasionally be acute and reversible (Young, Asbury, Corbett &amp; Adams, 1975). Autonomic dysfunction can arise from three main causes: first, those where the damage to the autonomic nervous system is isolated, as in primary postural hypotension (Bannister, Sever &amp; Gross, 1977) and familial dysautonomia (Brunt &amp; McKusick, 1970); secondly, those caused by toxic or pharmacological agents which interfere with autonomic reflexes; thirdly, those associated with systemic disease, of which diabetes mellitus is the most common. Other diseases which may cause autonomic dysfunction include amyloidosis, porphyria, tetanus, polyneuritis, tabes dorsalis, parkinsonism, chronic renal failure and alcoholism, and occasionally autonomic neuropathy has been associated with carcinoma of the bronchus or the pancreas (Johnson &amp; Spalding, 1974). Although it is possible to localize lesions within the autonomic nervous system to afferent or efferent sympathetic or parasympathetic pathways (Johnson &amp; Spalding, 1974; Moskowitz, 1977), many of the available tests are complex and invasive and often lack adequate control measurements (Young et al., 1975). Because of the patchy nature of autonomic neuropathy, current interest has centred around the search for bedside tests that are ‘global’, reproducible and non-invasive. This review summarizes the present state of knowledge of simple tests of cardiovascular reflex function in the clinical evaluation of autonomic neuropathy, particularly in diabetic subjects.",

It may coexist with spontaneously occurring seizures. Clinically, they manifest as partial or generalized seizures with either focal or generalized ictal epileptic discharges at onset.[[1]] Reflex seizures are precipitated by following stimuli: visual, somatosensory and proprioceptive, auditory, thinking, reading, music, startle, hot water, and eating. Proprioceptive-induced seizures are provoked by passive or active movement and are simple partial attacks presenting as tonic or clonic motor movements of a limb.[[2]] Here, we report a patient who had clonic movement of the left upper limb on forward abduction against gravity with corresponding epileptiform discharges from the right frontal region suggestive of possible proprioceptive-induced reflex seizures.",

      "title": "Spastic Hypertonia and Movement Disorders: Pathophysiology, Clinical Presentation, and Quantification",
      "abstract": "A delayed consequence of a lesion affecting the upper motor neuron pathways is the appearance of some forms of motor overactivity, including spasticity. Many of these are caused by hyperexcitability of spinal reflexes, such as stretch reflexes (spasticity, tendon hyperreflexia) or flexor withdrawal reflexes (flexor spasms), and are elicited at rest by sensory stimulation. Spastic co‐contraction is probably attributable to failure of reciprocal inhibition; it occurs only during active voluntary movement and constrains such movement. The basic underlying mechanism of these changes is not clear, although a change in the balance between the inhibitory and excitatory supraspinal upper motor neuron pathways toward net excitation most likely contributes. Increased intrinsic excitability of the alpha motor neurons is another possible factor. Spastic dystonia is most often seen as the presence of tonic muscle contraction in the absence of voluntary movement or spinal reflex activation, and the underlying mechanisms are obscure. Prolonged shortening of tissues, either because of weakness or muscle contraction, leads to stiffness of the soft tissues, which contributes to hypertonia and is thus self‐perpetuating, and ultimately to contracture with fixed shortening. Some of these forms of motor overactivity produce involuntary movements (hyperkinetic), eg, flexor spasms, whereas others impair movement (hypokinetic), either voluntary movement, eg, spastic co‐contraction, or passive movement, eg, spasticity. Quantification has mostly focused on hypertonia, that is, increased resistance at rest to passive movement. In the upper motor neuron syndrome, hypertonia could be caused by a combination of spasticity, spastic dystonia, and soft tissue stiffness (rheologic changes). Some measures, such as the Ashworth or Modified Ashworth Scales, quantify hypertonia but are very poor at distinguishing between spasticity and soft tissue stiffness. Another, the Tardieu Scale, is better at making this distinction, but quantification of the spasticity portion of hypertonia remains difficult, at least in a clinical setting.",

Mannerisms are maladaptive behaviours since they lead to withdrawal of and rejection by the socially interacting partner, or even induce aggressive behaviour due to the pathologically exaggerated and overdrawn appearance. The behaviour-physiology interactions of manneristic behaviour are not fully understood. Altered brain metabolism and disturbed perceptivity of social signals may be involved.",

      "abstract": "The aetiological diagnosis in an infant with hypotonia is a challenging task for a clinician due to variable and long list of differentials [1]. It could be due to an insult within the central nervous system (CNS) or less commonly result from a peripheral defect at neuro-muscular level and other miscellaneous causes (rickets, hypothyroidism) [2]. Most commonly it is a central hypotonia where the muscular weakness is absent or not profound. In Indian scenario, it is mostly idiopathic central hypotonia, followed by HIE (cerebral palsy) [2]. In cases of cerebral palsy, neuro-imaging reveals the severity of affliction. The peripheral aetiologies like congenital myopathies, congenital myasthenia, infantile botulism etc. are rather rare occurrences. Infants with congenital muscular dystrophy have muscular dystrophy, central neural affliction and involvement of multiple systems (skeletal, cardiovascular, respiratory, ocular etc.). It is a rare disease with studies in Italian population showing point prevalence of 0.563 per 100,000 total population [3]. Unlike HIE, the affliction in CMD is multi-system and it is an inherited disease with variable penetration, the distinction between the two is important to a clinician for the management. CMDs generally have early fatal outcome. So, early diagnosis is important for prognostication, supportive treatment and genetic counselling. The neuro-imaging findings of CMD clearly stand out from the rest aetiologies and can guide a clinician to go in early , for an invasive test like muscle biopsy which is the gold standard diagnostic test .",

      "abstract": "Abstract A seizure (also called attack, crisis, turn, fit, breakout, trembling, convulsion, and insult) is usually defined as a sudden alteration of behavior due to a temporary change in the electrical functioning of the brain, in particular the outer layer of the brain called the cortex. Epilepsy means recurrent seizures. Seizures can take many different forms, as the descriptions in this book indicate. However, any given person usually has a limited number of different types of seizures that they experience, and readers should understand that seizures affect different people in different ways. The material in this book points out these differences, but should not be taken to imply that every person with seizures will experience everything described in this book at some time. Sometimes, seizures can be triggered by alcohol, strong emotions, intense exercise, flashing lights or loud music, illness and fever, the menstrual period, lack of sleep, and stress. Often an individual learns to recognize what they may be susceptible to. Sometimes there is no identifiable or consistent trigger. Seizures have a beginning, a middle, and an end. When an individual is aware of the beginning, it may be thought of as a warning. Another word used for the warning is the aura. Auras are actually seizures that affect only a very small part of the brain; enough to cause symptoms, but not enough to disrupt consciousness. Doctors may refer to auras as “simple partial seizures”—“simple” means that consciousness is not impaired, and “partial” means that only part of the brain is involved with the seizure.",

      "abstract": "A complete spinal cord injury (SCI) is the complete sensory and motor loss below the site of spinal cord injury following acute or chronic destruction, compression, or ischemia of the spinal cord.Initially, this may present as spinal shock, which is an acute physiological loss or depression of spinal cord function.It presents as a flaccid areflexic paralysis below the level of the injury with autonomic features (e.g., hypotension and bradycardia).After some days to weeks the spinal shock wears off and a complete spinal cord injury may remain.It presents with spastic paresis, hyperreflexia, and continued sensory loss.The differentiation and regeneration potential of stem cells has been well studied in both preclinical and clinical investigations.A traumatic spinal cord injury triggers a complex local inflammatory reaction capable of enhancing repair and exacerbating pathology (Figure 1).",

Since early and intensive behavioral intervention is essential in the successful treatment of these disorders, early diagnosis is particularly crucial. The diagnosis of ASD is a multistep process, beginning with screening and followed by more comprehensive assessments (2). This full evaluation is necessary in order to rule out other disorders (such as verbal and nonverbal learning disabilities or organic brain disorder), and to guide treatment and educational planning. Full evaluations include, in addition to diagnosis, cognitive assessment, adaptive functioning assessment, and neuropsychological testing (e.g., memory, problem solving, planning, language, and visual-spatial reasoning).",

      "abstract": "The dystonias have been classified by a variety of criteria, including age at onset, anatomic distribution, etiology, and, most recently, genetics. One of the most striking and puzzling features of certain types of dystonia has been the selective involvement of certain motor programs where dystonic muscle contractions are restricted to specific tasks or motor acts while the same muscles can be activated normally with most or all other activities. Writer's cramp is the most common and prominent example of the task-specific dystonias, but selective hand dystonia can also affect a variety of other manual skills such as typing, sorting, and painting; playing string or keyboard instruments; or engaging in sports like tennis, golf, or snooker. The common theme to all taskspecific dystonias is that they selectively affect highly overlearned and automated types of movement and that treatment often fails to restore the premorbid level of function for the tasks involved. This chapter reviews the clinical features, pathophysiology, prognosis, and treatment of the task-specific dystonias as well as other limb-selective dystonias.",

      "title": "Family Stress and Counseling",
      "abstract": "Stress is a continually growing concern in our society. The impact of stress on mental health and physical illness can be significant and a major factor in healthcare costs in the United States. A large percentage of Americans report feeling moderate-to-high stress levels on a daily basis [1]. When stress extends to include family and social aspects of one's life, complexities can exist beyond just individual coping of a situation or event. Stress has been seen by both patients and physicians as influencing health outcomes. However, stress is often difficult to define and study, in relation to both physical symptoms and external causes [2]. Family stress can be viewed as a disturbance in the ongoing state of a family system. This disturbance can occur both outside of the system (e.g., war, unemployment, natural disaster) and inside the family system (e.g., death, divorce, chronic illness). This systemic stress creates a change in the family's routine functioning [3]. Normative stressors (e.g., birth of a child, job transition, loss of an older adult) in families are considered to be common and predictable sources of stress. Nonnormative family stressors (e.g., early widowhood, job loss, natural disaster) are uncommon and unexpected and may occur at times other than those expected in the life cycle of the family or its members [4, 5]. How well the family unit copes with these two types of stressors largely impacts both the short-term and long-term adjustments and well-being of both the unit and the individuals in it.",

The patient experiences painful tiredness; in hypotonic tendomyosis the contraction of the muscles becomes painful local on pressure and the patient experiences muscular fatigue or weakness. Contraction becomes painful.3. Reflectory painfulness of the joint capsule and ligaments. The signs stated above are reproducible:1. voluntary externally by voluntary execution of a movement or by assuming a certain posture that is slowed down or inhibited via arthrotendomyotic phenomena, and complete relief from this pain is achieved by elimination of the disturbing factor, for example the crooked posture.2. involuntarily »internally«: In case of disturbing factors such as muscular contractures the arthrotendomyotic reactions disappear as soon as the muscular contractures are reversed.",

      "abstract": "Introducao: O aumento significativo de idosos na populacao atribui ao seculo XXI uma demanda maior de atencao e cuidados especificos para essa faixa etaria. Diante do processo de envelhecimento, o individuo apresenta comprometimento de uma serie de estruturas fisiologicas em varios sistemas importantes para o desempenho da marcha, principalmente no sistema nervoso, reduzindo habilidades importantes para a manutencao do equilibrio postural. O equilibrio e um processo complexo que depende da integracao da visao, da sensacao vestibular e periferica, dos comandos centrais e respostas neuromusculares e, particularmente, da forca muscular e do tempo de reacao. A diminuicao do desempenho da marcha e um processo comum no envelhecimento, sendo frequentemente associada a varios efeitos adversos a saude, como fragilidade, quedas, hospitalizacoes e qualidade de vida insatisfatoria. Reconhecida como medida de desempenho da mobilidade, a velocidade da marcha tem sido diretamente relacionada as habilidades cognitivas de um individuo. Um declinio da funcao relacionado a idade pode ser demonstrado em todas as partes desses sistemas, tendo como resultado o fato de que um terco da populacao acima de 65 anos sofre quedas a cada ano. Objetivo: Avaliar a relacao da velocidade da marcha e do equilibrio estatico no risco de queda em idosos sedentarios. Metodologia: Trata-se de um estudo de carater transversal, observacional e de campo, com abordagem quantitativa. A amostra foi por conveniencia, e teve sua coleta realizada no periodo de seis meses a partir da aprovacao pelo Comite de Etica em Pesquisa (CEP), composta por idosos, com idade compreendida entre 60 e 80 anos, que estiveram de acordo com a realizacao da pesquisa e assinaram o Termo de Consentimento Livre e Esclarecido (TCLE). Os individuos inseridos no estudo foram submetidos a avaliacao da escala BERG, bem como fizeram o teste de velocidade da marcha (TVM) e do risco de quedas e fragilidade, atraves do teste Time Up and Go (TUG). Os dados coletados foram tabulados em uma planilha do Microsoft Excel® Office 2016 e, posteriormente, analisados atraves de frequencia absoluta e relativa e apresentados sob a forma de tabelas e figuras, sendo considerados como significância estatistica aqueles que apresentaram p < 0,05. Resultados: A associacao entre TUG e TVM mostrou que quanto maior o risco de queda, mais lenta e a marcha apresentada pelo paciente. Quando associado TUG e BERG, notou-se que quanto maior o deficit de equilibrio, maior o risco de queda. Atraves da associacao entre BERG e TVM, observou-se que quanto maior o deficit de equilibrio, menor sera a velocidade da marcha manifestada. Conclusao: As correlacoes entre os testes se fazem coerentes, mostrando que quanto maior o deficit de equilibrio, menor sera a velocidade da marcha apresentada no grupo feminino e, consequentemente, maior o risco de queda.",

In the writer's own case psychosis eventually encroached after real persecution, severe life stress and enhanced arousal and was prompted by an ascription of high distinctiveness to self and a low distinctiveness to others. The impact of coincidences generated and confirmed an interpretation of an externallocus of control. Abnormality ('illness') was reflected in a massive escalation of confirmation blas. It is argued that psychosis has its own intrinsic motivation; that life events must be understood in a developmental context; that cognitive factors, often critical, can sometimes be tied to emotional determinants and that gross damage to the self concept, with consequences for spiritual life, plays a causal role in psychosis. A genetic fragility, which biases ongoing emotional and cognitive life, is nonetheless strongly indicated.",

      "abstract": "Self-transcendence is an ambiguous construct without consensual meaning, yet many claim that it relates to, or even causes, beneficial outcomes. Few discuss its potential deleterious side effects, choosing to focus primarily on positive effects. However, anything with sufficient potency to heal may have unintended side effects, especially when it leads beyond a transitory state to becoming an enduring trait, such as when self-transcendence (ST) becomes persistent self-transcendence (PST). With PST, evidence is overviewed here, along with two illustrative case reports, that people can suffer emotional difficulties, motivation changes, loss of self-reflexivity, anhedonia, dissociation, depersonalization, memory problems, and other psychological concerns. This is discussed in terms of the disruption of the sense of self, which ordinarily serves as an integrative center for the person that conveys a sense of agency. Possible neurobiological and sociocultural effects of PST are also discussed, with a focus on its role on narrative memory as the construction of self-concept. Evidence has also been accumulating on problematic side effects of meditation and mindfulness, techniques commonly presented as paths to PST. Given that PST is often presented as a pinnacle of human development and spiritual attainment, seekers of PST, psychologists, and other mental health professionals are urged to become informed about its possible side effects, and view this phenomenon in a more balanced way.",

Generally there is an increased vitality, a state of hyperæsthesia, an increase in the activity of the brain, generally of the whole brain, and we must believe that these states will not so easily end in complete resolution as the condition of merely depressed action, or rather no action, which obtains in melancholia—I mean in melancholia generally, and not those states of acute melancholia which are supposed to be closely allied to the state which in other brains and under other subjective circumstances would give rise to mania from a pathological point of view.

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a severe, frequent, heterogeneous, longlasting and disabling chronic mental illness with high social impact, belonging to the group of chronic psychoses. There are several clinical forms and several possible evolutionary modes. Its etiopathogenesis is multifactorial (hereditary, biological, environmental, etc.) but no single cause has been demonstrated up till now. Schizophrenia is a group of disabling heterogeneous disorders that are generally severe, the course of which is chronic and disabling, and the prognosis is poor. Many retrospective studies have attempted to trace the premorbid history of adult subjects who developed schizophrenia. Their results appear to be extremely disparate, due in particular to the heterogeneity of the means of investigation used. In addition, in recent years, many studies have focused on prodromal symptoms occurring during the year preceding the first psychotic episode in late adolescence or early adulthood. Minor physical cranio-cerebral (at the level of the ears, the palate, the cranial perimeter), temporomandibular, dental and palatal abnormalities, dermatoglyphic disturbances or even subtle neurological signs have been frequently found in schizophrenic patients, in particular oral anomalies, more precisely the measurements of the teeth, their vestibulo-lingual and mesio-distal diameters. The objective of our article is to study the morphological abnormalities that exist in the patient with schizophrenia, and to demonstrate whether there is a link between the presence of these physical abnormalities and the occurrence of schizophrenia. This issue has been vaguely mentioned in the literature, but in the Moroccan context, it is a pilot study.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is common, chronic and disabling. While psychotic features, i.e. delusions, hallucinations and disordered thinking, are critical to diagnosis, accompanying cognitive deficits are receiving increasing attention. Such deficits, occurring early in the course of the disease, are incapacitating, perhaps more so than the psychotic features (Harvey et al ., 2003), and have prognostic significance (Fujii and Wylie, 2003). They may be seen in apparently unaffected relatives of people with schizophrenia (Faraone et al ., 1995). In this issue of Brain , Whalley et al . (2004) demonstrate changes in brain responses to cognitive demands in a group of people who are at risk of developing schizophrenia (having two or more first‐ or second‐degree relatives with the disease). Furthermore, a distinctive pattern of brain activation characterizes those in whom the disease may be emerging.\n\nAt‐risk subjects and matched controls underwent functional MRI (fMRI) while silently completing sentences that varied from strongly constrained (e.g. ‘He mailed the letter without a ………’) to weakly constrained (e.g. ‘Rushing out, he forgot to take his………’). Four levels of constraint were used to manipulate task difficulty (higher constraint = easier sentence completion). At‐risk subjects showed abnormal responses to increasing task difficulty in frontal, thalamic and cerebellar regions. None of the subjects met diagnostic criteria for a psychotic illness. Moreover, none were on any medication and none sought treatment or even considered themselves unwell. In a subgroup (40%), detailed questioning elicited evidence of psychotic features, and this was associated with an additional change in parietal cortex.\n\nThese observations, made in individuals at an age when the onset …",

      "title": "Management of chronic non-cancer pain in primary care",
      "abstract": "Opening Vignette Mrs Yeo, a 68-year-old woman, came to you for chronic back pain, which had been persistent for the past year. She had been doctor-hopping, hoping to find an effective pain relief. About 6 months ago, she visited an orthopaedics specialist, who diagnosed her with degenerative disc disease and offered surgery, but she was not keen. Due to the back pain, Mrs Yeo stopped her part-time job 3 months ago and had been staying home more often instead of participating in community activities or interacting with her neighbours. She expressed hopelessness and lamented about the impact of the back pain on her function and lifestyle.WHAT IS CHRONIC PAIN? Chronic pain refers to pain that lasts for more than 3 months and persists past normal healing time. According to the International Association for the Study of Pain, pain is defined as \"an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with, or resembling that associated with, actual or potential tissue damage\". It is always a personal experience that is influenced to varying degrees by biological, psychological and social factors.[1] The perception of pain is often affected by personal life experiences, emotional factors, personal belief systems and family upbringing and values. HOW COMMON IS THIS IN MY PRACTICE? About 8.7% of the Singapore population experiences chronic pain.[2] Within this subset, a higher prevalence of chronic pain is present among females (10.9%) and it increases significantly among people above 65 years old. Chronic pain is a risk factor for psychological disorders. A Singapore cross-sectional epidemiological survey showed that chronic pain is significantly associated with major depressive disorder (odds ratio 2.4) and generalised anxiety disorder (odds ratio 3.0).[3] The economic effects of chronic pain are substantial. Another local cross-sectional study showed that episodic migraine alone posed an economic burden of SGD 1 billion per year, translating to about 2% of total government healthcare expenditure in Singapore.[4] HOW RELEVANT IS THIS TO MY PRACTICE? With Singapore's ageing population, the prevalence of chronic pain is expected to increase, and it will be beneficial for family physicians (FPs) and general practitioners (GPs) to manage uncomplicated chronic pain conditions. Complex cases may still eventually require a pain specialist's review. Chronic pain is challenging to manage in primary care. Although there are few studies conducted on the local practice of chronic pain management, some common barriers have been identified. In a local qualitative study, fellow physicians in Singapore shared that a considerable number of physicians still view chronic pain in a biomedical model rather than a biopsychosocial model. In addition, the older community often feels stigmatised or views it negatively when offered psychological treatments for chronic pain. This lack of public awareness also deters physicians from referring older persons for psychological treatment. Keeping a close and therapeutic relationship with patients, involving the family members and having consistent graduated patient education on the multifaceted nature of chronic pain were found to be helpful.[5] In our local context, chronic pain management may incur considerable costs, especially in the aspect of psychological treatment, which may not be covered under government subsidy schemes such as Medisave. This, in turn, can further deter patients from pursuing holistic treatment. FPs and GPs can look into these factors and better reach out to patients. In this article, we aim to shed light on the range of management strategies available to manage chronic pain conditions [Box 1]. Chronic pain management is complex to manage in a primary care setting and it often requires multidisciplinary co-management (FP or GP, pain specialist, physiotherapist, occupational therapist and psychologist) with the necessary patient empowerment and link-up with community resources.Box 1: Common chronic non-cancer pain conditions.WHAT CAN I DO IN MY PRACTICE? Chronic and acute pain management has some similarities, although their management differs in some regard due to the different pathophysiologies. Besides the underlying nociceptive or neuropathic pain, the perception of pain and suffering is often contributed by psychological factors, personal beliefs, life experiences and social factors such as financial struggles or litigation.[6] It should be ingrained into our daily practice to elicit and address the root causes to manage chronic pain effectively. Figure 1 shows a brief overview of an approach that can be applied in primary care. For patients with chronic pain lasting from months to years, the priority is not to eliminate pain completely, as this is often ambitious to achieve, but to improve function and quality of life. Chronic pain should be treated with a multimodal 4 'P's approach, which are Pharmacological and non-pharmacological (Physical, Psychological and Procedural) strategies. These strategies can be initiated early and concurrently for greater effectiveness and to instill confidence in the doctor–patient relationship.Figure 1: Chart shows the overview of approach to chronic pain in primary care.Non-pharmacological therapy The pathophysiology in chronic pain commonly involves central sensitisation and may be associated with underlying psychiatric conditions. Chronic pain management can be effective with non-pharmacological interventions such as physiotherapy, yoga, mindfulness, exercise, heat and cold application therapy, acupuncture, patient education and empowerment. However, the effect of these interventions was reported to be either immediate or short term, which suggests that non-pharmacological interventions should be done regularly for a sustained effect.[7] A typical physiotherapy course consists of two or three sessions each week for a duration of 8–12 weeks. Failure to show improvement within this time frame should prompt the physician to reconsider if physiotherapy is still recommended.[8] However, in the local context, due to exceeding demand for subsidised physiotherapy services, public healthcare institutions are unable to accommodate two or three sessions per week for each patient. These limited resources can be made more available and efficient by educating and empowering patients with the right mindset and attitudes towards exercise regime. Empowerment can further enable patients to sustain the efforts and reap its benefits. Pharmacological therapy Chronic pain can be broadly classified into nociceptive pain and neuropathic pain. Generally, nociceptive pain is sharp and well localised, while neuropathic pain is characterised by paraesthesia (numbing, shooting, cramping sensation) and may be poorly localised. Occasionally, patients may present with both nociceptive and neuropathic pain. Among patients who have end-stage knee or hip osteoarthritis, which is traditionally understood as nociceptive pain, about 35% of women and 27% of men have pain features that are suggestive of neuropathic knee pain.[9] This dichotomy can assist FPs and GPs to prescribe the appropriate pharmacological therapy. Typically, all pain should be treated according to the World Health Organization (WHO) pain guidelines, starting with non-opioid modalities to weak opioids and escalating to opioid therapy, with gabapentinoids and antidepressants conventionally reserved for neuropathic pain. If the pain is mild, a single analgesia can be given. For moderate or severe pain, combining multiple analgesic agents should be considered. These combination therapies have synergistic effects, which allow for lower doses of each analgesia and reduce the risks of adverse effects of each analgesia. When initiating treatment, the efficacy can be assessed after 2–4 weeks. If deemed ineffective, the medication can be switched to an alternative agent, reduced or withdrawn. The effect of pharmacological therapy is short-lived, and this may encourage patient reliance on medications in the long term, leading to higher risks of adverse effects. Hence, treatment often needs to be individualised, directed according to patients' functional limitations and goals, and kept as short a period as possible [Table 1].Table 1: Overview of common non-opioid pharmacological agents.[ 10 ]Opioid therapy Discussion surrounding opioid therapy should include the common side effects and the increased risks of opioid dependence and abuse. In line with the recent release of the Ministry of Health Opioid Guidelines, long-term opioid therapy should not be routinely prescribed.[11] If a patient is started on opioid therapy, regular assessments of the patient's response should be conducted. The doctor should consider ceasing the therapy if there is no improvement in the quality of life or achievement of functional outcomes, or if there is any suspicion of abuse. The risk factors of opioid therapy include developing comorbidities such as major depression and psychosis, suicidal tendencies and substance abuse. There are several scoring systems for prediction of aberrant use before initiation of opioid therapy, such as the 'Opioid Risk Tool' and the 'Screener and Opioid Assessment for Patients with Pain' (SOAPP).[12] With these screening tools, the risks of aberrant behaviour from opioid use can be stratified as low risk, moderate risk or high risk. Low-risk patients are generally deemed reasonable to start opioid therapy in primary care. High-risk patients should be referred to pain specialist for further management. Procedural treatment Lastly, there are various types of procedures that can help manage chronic pain, such as injections and nerve blocks. Patients who are suffering from chronic back pain due to disc herniation, spinal stenosis, discogenic pain or post-surgery syndrome may benefit from having epidural injections.[13] There is debatable evidence for intra-articular injectables for the management of chronic knee osteoarthritis.[14] Timely referral to tertiary pain specialists and, hence, access to these procedures can help to provide synergistic effort in managing chronic pain. As a result, patients can achieve significant improvement in pain control, which will strengthen their adherence to subsequent treatments. HOW CAN I PROVIDE MORE HOLISTIC MANAGEMENT? Patients with chronic pain often have associated psychological complications such as depression and anxiety, and face social issues such as unemployment. This is especially prominent among patients with a low socioeconomic status. A local study showed that a person with chronic pain is twice as likely to face unemployment compared to a person of similar socioeconomic status without chronic pain.[15] It is challenging for FPs and GPs to thoroughly address these issues in a time-efficient manner. However, FPs and GPs can value-add by improving communication with tertiary centres, highlighting new issues and working together to best manage these psychosocial issues. There are several support groups available for patients and their caregivers, such as the Knee Osteoarthritis Improvement Group for patients with knee osteoarthritis and the Autoimmune Diseases Support Group for patients with rheumatoid arthritis. TOUCH Community Services also has a community musculoskeletal clinic which is mainly run by physiotherapists. Patients facing employment woes can also approach government agencies such as Workforce Singapore, which provides training opportunities, career guidance and links to job openings. The Skillsfuture programme provides a platform to access courses and training to improve employability. National Arthritis Foundation is a charitable body which raises funds to be utilised as financial subsidies for financially needy patients for treatment or to enhance employment prospects. In addition, patient's mental well-being often suffers along with the chronic pain. Chronic pain can also bring about friction among family members as patients assume the sick role. With multiple facets of life affected, these patients may find it difficult to access help and have respite. FPs and GPs can suggest and link up the patients with available community resources. Besides the Samaritans of Singapore hotline, there are various avenues for counselling that may be helpful [Table 2]. These organisations include Silver Ribbon Singapore, which offers free basic counselling services, and Singapore Association for Mental Health (SAMH), which provides in-person counselling sessions. Other organisations may have religious roots, in which some patients may find the counselling more relatable. These include Shan You, an organisation with buddhist roots, and Calvary Community Care, which was founded by a church. Typically, churches have volunteers who provide help with counselling as well.Table 2: Summary of community resources.*WHEN SHOULD I REFER TO A SPECIALIST? Doctors should refer their patients to a specialist in these scenarios: (a) the patient has persistent pain that significantly impacts on function and quality of life or causes anxiety and/or depression, and has not responded to initial management; (b) the patient continues to seek medical treatment for persistent pain that cannot be explained; (c) the patient is a possible candidate for interventional treatment; (d) the patient requires high-dose opioid therapy, shows possible opioid dependence or has a moderate-to-high risk of opioid dependence based on risk screening tools; and (e) the patient needs multimodal treatment not available in a primary care setting. TAKE-HOME MESSAGES Elucidate the cause of the pain. If the chronic pain is secondary to a mechanical pathology (i.e. spinal stenosis or osteoarthritis), explore if surgical options have been discussed. Chronic non-cancer pain often has many facets. Considering the biopsychosocial aspects of the presentation can help to identify various contributing factors and provide effective treatment. 4 'P's management: Pharmacological, Physical, Psychological and Procedural. There are numerous pharmacological treatments available, and these medications can be directed based on the type of pain and the underlying contributing disease. Opioid therapy is often associated with adverse effects, misuse and dependence. Utilising risk screening tools and regular monitoring can help to reduce these problems and allow for early detection and intervention. Patients should be empowered through patient education and understand the various treatments for better management of chronic pain. Consider other non-pharmacological treatments as a multimodal approach, especially for patients who may not be suitable for surgical treatment and aggressive pharmacological treatment due to its adverse effects. Consider psychosocial implications of chronic pain and offer management options for more holistic care. Timely referral to a tertiary centre should be considered and made in the above-mentioned situations. Closing Vignette You found out that Mrs Yeo had mild depression brought on by the chronic back pain and the resultant functional limitations. She had previously been trialled on paracetamol and short courses of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. You started her on combination therapy, including duloxetine, and explained to her about the biopsychosocial nature of chronic pain. On review, Mrs Yeo's pain had improved, although it was still causing functional limitations. You referred her to a pain specialist for consideration of procedural treatment, as well as a physiotherapist and psychologist. After 3 months, Mrs Yeo reported that she was feeling much better and was now able to better ambulate in the community.Financial support and sponsorship Nil.

Originally, as ‘adjustment reaction’, it was one of a very few disorder categories included in major psychiatric classification schemes specifically for use in children and adolescents. In DSM-I, for instance, adjustment reaction and childhood schizophrenia were the only two categories of childhood psychiatric disorder. The intention was to indicate that some instances of disordered behaviour or emotions arose specifically because of an identified stressor rather than, say, a process of mental illness. The source of stress was originally thought of as including both external events (such as bereavement) or an internal developmental process, which might require significant adaptation of mental functioning (such as maturational changes during adolescence). There was an implicit idea that adjustment to adversity or intra-psychic conflict could be either adaptive or maladaptive. If it was maladaptive, then personal dysfunction was to be seen as a psychiatric condition.",

The other major groups of TLOC are generalized epileptic seizures, “functional” or behavioral events (mimicking either epilepsy or syncope), and a group of miscellaneous disorders. Various causes of syncope may often coexist in elderly patients. Recurrent unprovoked syncope provoked by startle or exercise, or family history of epilepsy or sudden death in young patients suggest an inherited channelopathy. The evaluation of patients with TLOC consists of a careful history, physical examination, standard ECG and, in specific cases, head-up tilt test, autonomic reflex screen, Holter monitoring; echocardiogram, and video-EEG monitoring. The treatment of reflex syncope includes explanation and reassurance; avoidance of triggers; maintenance of appropriate water and sodium intake; regular exercise; and use of isometric counterpressure maneuvers.

The distinguishing characteristic of ATPD is its abrupt onset. Second, there are characteristic symptoms present, and third, there is related acute stress [2].&#x0D; Clinical Findings: Sleep disturbance, aggressiveness, muttering to self, irritability, irrelevant talks and loss of appétit, hearing of voices not heard by others, suspiciousness, increased talkativeness, increased energy and fearfulness.&#x0D; Mental Status Examination: Conscious, dressed appropriately, well groomed, standing, eye to eye contact initiated, non cooperative, activity normal, and the mood is exhausted, frustrated, the affect is irritable, guarded, and the flow of speech rate is rapid with moderate volume and responsive quality, Thought-flight of thoughts is evident, as are perceptual abnormalities- auditory hallucination, impaired social judgment, and full denial of sickness.&#x0D; Outcome: After treatment, the patient shows improvement. Irritability has reduced, sleeping pattern is improved, self muttering has stopped, irrelevant talks are less, and aggressiveness is reduced.&#x0D; Conclusion: Patient was admitted to Psychiatric Ward with a known case of Bipolar Affective Disorder and after Mental Status Examination he is diagnosed as Acute Transient Psychotic Disorder with complain of Sleep disturbance, aggressiveness, muttering to self, irritability, irrelevant talks. He improved after receiving adequate treatment, and the treatment was continuously ongoing until my last date of care.",

      "abstract": "Brief psychotic disorder (BPD) according to DSM-5 is the sudden onset of psychotic behavior that lasts less than 1 month followed by complete remission with possible future relapses. It is differentiated from schizophreniform disorder and schizophrenia by the duration of the psychosis. The diagnosis is often anticipatory or retrospective due to the diagnostic requirement of complete remission within 1 month. Brief psychotic disorder is an acute but transient disorder with the onset of one or more of the following psychotic symptoms: Delusions Hallucinations Disorganized speech Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior At least one of these symptoms must be delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech. The symptoms in BPD last between one day to one month, with a complete return to premorbid level of functioning after the disease course in response to antipsychotic medications. The disturbance in behavior cannot be better accounted for by schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, mood disorder with psychotic features, or be a direct result of a drug, medication, or medical condition like thyrotoxicosis, sarcoidosis, or syphilis.",

By its polymorphic expression, self mutilation demonstrates that it refers back to diverse psychic structures, from precarious neurotic structures to melancholic depression, passing by way of the false self and alexithymic functioning, which are more or less organized with perverse defense mechanisms.",

Questions should be asked about the mechanism of onset and exacerbating factors, and the frequency, duration and severity of the pain. The examination should check gait and alignment, flexibility, strength and reflexes, and localize and evaluate the pain. Warning signs of serious problems include constant pain in a child younger than 11 years of age that lasts for several weeks or occurs spontaneously at night, repeatedly interferes with school, play or sports, or is associated with marked stiffness and limitation of motion, fever or neurologic abnormalities. Pain at the lumbosacral junction may suggest spondylolysis or spondylolisthesis. Scheuermann disease is diagnosed by the observance of wedging, irregularity or growth disturbance of three successive vertebrae. Musculoligamentous pain may result from injury to or overuse of muscles or joints of the back. Rare causes include discitis, tuberculosis, bone or spinal cord tumor, pyelonephritis and retroperitoneal infection.",

Factors such as substance use or withdrawal, related psychosocial stressors, and co-occurring somatic health problems complicate the diagnostic process. Addressing psychiatric symptoms is essential to optimizing treatment of substance use disorders. Medications can help but may be unnecessary once substance use is stabilized. Other approaches include counseling, psychotherapy, case coordination, and inpatient or residential care. There are additional issues that arise with specific psychiatric disorders, including mood disorders (depression and bipolar), anxiety and trauma-related disorders (post-traumatic stress disorder [PTSD]), psychotic disorders, personality disorders, and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).",

      "title": "Nystagmus: Diagnosis, Topographic Anatomical Localization and Therapy",
      "abstract": "Nystagmus is defined as rhythmic, most often involuntary eye movements. It normally consists of a slow (pathological) drift of the eyes, followed by a fast central compensatory movement back to the primary position (refixation saccade). The direction, however, is reported according to the fast phase. The cardinal symptoms are, on the one hand, blurred vision, jumping images (oscillopsia), reduced visual acuity and, sometimes, double vision; many of these symptoms depend on the eye position. On the other hand, depending on the etiology, patients may suffer from the following symptoms: 1. permanent dizziness, postural imbalance, and gait disorder (typical of downbeat and upbeat nystagmus); 2. if the onset of symptoms is acute, the patient may experience spinning vertigo with a tendency to fall to one side (due to ischemia in the area of the brainstem or cerebellum with central fixation nystagmus or as acute unilateral vestibulopathy with spontaneous peripheral vestibular nystagmus); or 3. positional vertigo. There are two major categories: the first is spontaneous nystagmus, i.e., nystagmus which occurs in the primary position as upbeat or downbeat nystagmus; and the second includes various types of nystagmus which are induced or modified by certain factors. Examples are gaze-evoked nystagmus, head-shaking nystagmus, positional nystagmus, and hyperventilation-induced nystagmus. In addition, there are disorders similar to nystagmus, such as ocular flutter or opsoclonus. The most common central types of spontaneous nystagmus are downbeat and upbeat, infantile, pure torsional, pendular fixation, periodic alternating, and seesaw nystagmus. Many types of nystagmus allow a precise neuroanatomical localization: for instance, downbeat nystagmus, which is most often caused by a bilateral floccular lesion or dysfunction, or upbeat nystagmus, which is caused by a lesion in the midbrain or medulla. Examples of drug treatment are the use of 4-aminopyridine for downbeat and upbeat nystagmus, memantine or gabapentin for pendular fixation nystagmus, or baclofen for periodic alternating nystagmus. In this article we are focusing on nystagmus. In a second article we will focus on central ocular motor disorders, such as saccade or gaze palsy, internuclear ophthalmoplegia, and gaze-holding deficits. Therefore, these types of eye movements will not be described here in detail.Unter einem Nystagmus versteht man rhythmische Augenbewegungen, die i. d. R. aus einer langsamen (ursächlichen bzw. pathologischen) Augendrift und einer schnellen kompensatorischen Rückstellbewegung (Rückstellsakkade) bestehen; die Richtung wird klinisch nach der schnellen Phase angegeben. Leitsymptome sind zum einen Verschwommensehen, „hüpfende oder laufende Bilder“ (Oszillopsien), verminderte Sehschärfe sowie manchmal Doppelbilder, die oft blickpositionsabhängig sind. Zum anderen können die Patienten, je nach Ursache, leiden unter 1. permanentem Schwankschwindel und Gangunsicherheit (wie beim Downbeat- [DBN] oder Upbeat-Nystagmus [UBN]), 2. Drehschwindel mit gerichteter Fallneigung (bei akutem Beginn) sowie 3. Lagerungsschwindel. Es lassen sich im Wesentlichen zwei Kategorien unterscheiden: 1. Spontannystagmus, d. h. ein Nystagmus, der in Geradeausblickposition auftritt, wie DBN oder UBN, und 2. verschiedene Nystagmusformen, die durch bestimmte Faktoren ausgelöst oder moduliert werden, wie Blickrichtungs-, Kopfschüttel-, Rebound-, Lagerungs-, hyperventilations- oder druckinduzierter Nystagmus. Daneben gibt es noch nystagmusähnliche schnelle Augenbewegungen wie Ocular Flutter oder Opsoklonus. Die häufigsten zentralen Formen eines Spontannystagmus sind DBN, UBN, infantiler Nystagmus, seltener sind Fixationspendelnystagmus, rein torsioneller, periodisch alternierender und See-saw-Nystagmus. Viele Nystagmusformen erlauben eine genaue anatomische Lokalisation, wie z. B. der DBN, der meistens auf einer beidseitigen zerebellären Flocculusläsion beruht oder der UBN auf einer Läsion im Mesenzephalon oder der Medulla oblongata. Beispiele einer Pharmakotherapie sind die Gabe von 4-Aminopyridin beim DBN und UBN, Memantin oder Gabapentin beim Fixationspendelnystagmus oder Baclofen beim periodisch alternierenden Nystagmus. Abschließend: in einem nachfolgenden Artikel werden in dieser Zeitschrift die häufigsten und klinisch relevanten zentralen Okulomotorikstörungen wie Sakkaden und Blickparesen, internukleäre Ophthalmoplegie oder Blickhaltedefekte dargestellt, sodass auf diese hier nicht detailliert eingegangen wird.",

Typically, compulsive sexual behaviors are characterized by the failure to resist the urge for a given sexual behavior, which is frequently followed by feelings of guilt, regret, and self-reproach, leading to their inclusion in the spectrum of impulse control disorders. The treatment of compulsive sexual behaviors is challenging, with reports of varying success for several psychotherapeutic and pharmacologic interventions, including serotonin reuptake inhibitors, mood stabilizers, and antipsychotics.",

Since psychotic persons may commit horrifying acts, such as enucleation of an eye or amputation of a body part, identification of high risk patients is crucial. Stereotypical self-mutilation, such as head banging and biting off of fingertips, is associated with mental retardation and with the syndromes of Lesch-Nyhan, deLange, and Tourette. This type of self-mutilation is the focus of biological research or endorphins and on dopamine receptors. Skin cutting and burning, the most common type of self-mutilation, is often associated with personality disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, and multiple personality disorder. When cutting and burning become established as responses to disturbing psychological symptoms on environmental events, a specific Axis I impulse disorder known as Repetitive Self Mutilation may be diagnosed. Patients with this newly identified syndrome may alternate their direct acts of self-mutilation with eating disorders and episodic alcoholism.",

      "title": "Diagnosis of psychogenic (functional) gait disorders",
      "abstract": "Psychogenic gait is common in patients with medically unexplained neurological symptoms and provides significant challenges to healthcare providers. Clinicians may arrive at a correct diagnosis earlier if distinctive positive signs are identified and acknowledged. Psychogenic disorders of posture and gait are common and are the major manifestation in 8–10 % of patients with psychogenic movement disorders. Psychogenic movement disorders can present with varied phenomenology that may resemble organic movement disorders. The diagnosis is based on clinical evaluation with a supporting history and classic features on neurologic examination. In functional gait disorders, walking is often bizarre and does not conform to any of the usual patterns observed with neurologic gait disorders. Astasia-abasia, an inability to stand (astasia) or walk (abasia) in the absence of other neurologic abnormalities, was the term applied by investigators in the mid to late 19thcentury to describe certain patients with a frankly functional gait. Other descriptive terms include gaits that resemble walking on ice, walking a sticky surface, walking through water (bringing to mind excessive slowness), tightrope walking, habitual limping, and bizarre, robotic, knock-kneed, trepidant, anxious, and cautious gaits. Ancillary testing, such as imaging and neurophysiologic studies, can provide supplementary information but is not necessary for diagnosis.",

      "abstract": "Psychomotor disadaptation syndrome (PDS) was first described in France by the Dijon geriatric school, 25 years ago, and named \"psychomotor regression syndrome\". The initial clinical description still remains without modifications. However, progress has been made both in understanding its physiopathology and management, and its name has been changed into PDS in the late 1990s. Since the early 2000s, it was also termed frontal-sub-cortical dysfunction syndrome. PDS results from decompensation of postural function, gait and psychomotor automatisms linked to posture and motor programming impairment related to fronto-sub-cortical lesions. PDS is characterized by retropulsion, non-specific gait disorders, neurological signs (including akinesia, reactional hypertonia, and impaired reactive postural responses and protective reactions) and psychological disorders (fear of standing and walking as an acute feature or cognitive processing retardation and anhedonia as a chronic feature). PDS occurrence is linked to three factors implicated in functional reserve impairment due to frontal-sub-cortical structures disturbances: aging, chronic affections (mainly of degenerative or vascular origin), and acute organic or functional factors which induce cerebral blood flow decrease. Multidisciplinary management, including medical motor physiotherapy and psychological approach, is required for patients with PDS care.",

      "title": "A comparison of two models of ADHD: state regulation versus delay aversion",
      "abstract": "“Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder” (ADHD), in het Nederlands “aandachtstekortstoornis met hyperactiviteit”, is een van de meest voorkomende psychiatrische stoornissen. ADHD is een ontwikkelingsstoornis die gekenmerkt wordt door ernstige en persisterende symptomen van onoplettendheid, impulsiviteit en/of hyperactiviteit; en leidt tot significante beperkingen in beroepsmatig, schools of sociaal functioneren (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR), American Psychiatric Association, 2000). \r\nTot op heden is de etiologie van ADHD nog niet volledig begrepen en bestaan er verschillende neuropsychologische theorieen ter verklaring van de symptomen van ADHD. Lange tijd werd verondersteld dat de symptomen van ADHD het gevolg zijn van een primair tekort in executief functioneren zoals inhibitie, planning, werkgeheugen en “set shifting” (voor een overzicht: zie Barkley, 1997; Castellanos & Tannock, 2002). Recent onderzoek heeft echter aangetoond dat executieve verklaringsmodellen onvoldoende de symptomen van ADHD kunnen verklaren (Willcutt et al., 2005). Bovendien suggereren recentere neuropsychologische theorieen dat tekortkomingen in executief functioneren bij kinderen met ADHD niet statisch zijn; het al dan niet optreden van zwakkere prestaties zou namelijk afhangen van de situationele en motivationele context. Huidig proefschrift focust op twee vooraanstaande neuropsychologische modellen die het dynamische karakter van ADHD benadrukken en in het bijzonder de rol van contextuele factoren: het toestandsregulatiemodel (State Regulation Deficit model (SRD); van der Meere, 2002) en het “Delay Aversion” model (DAv; Sonuga-Barke, Wiersema, van der Meere, & Roeyers, 2010).\r\nHet toestandsregulatiemodel stelt dat prestaties afhankelijk zijn van energetische processen zoals arousal, activatie en effort (Sanders, 1983). Volgens dit model hebben kinderen met ADHD moeilijkheden met het aanpassen van hun energetische interne toestand aan de veranderende eisen uit de omgeving (van der Meere, 2002). Onderzoek heeft aangetoond dat omgevingsfactoren, zoals het manipuleren van de snelheid waarmee informatie wordt aangeboden tijdens een taak, een invloed heeft op de interne toestand. Meer concreet zou een snelle stimulusaanbieding leiden tot een overactieve toestand en een trage stimulusaanbieding tot een onderactieve toestand. Kinderen met ADHD zouden er niet in slagen om deze sub-optimale toestanden te reguleren, namelijk een onderactieve toestand op te krikken en een overactieve toestand te temperen, waardoor ze zwakke prestaties behalen. Het toestandsregulatiemodel veronderstelt aldus een omgekeerde U relatie tussen de interne toestand en taakprestaties. Aangezien kinderen met ADHD problemen hebben met het reguleren van hun interne toestand, zou deze omgekeerde U functie bij hen uitdrukkelijker tot uiting komen in vergelijking met typisch ontwikkelende kinderen. Onderzoek waarbij de snelheid van stimulusaanbieding werd gemanipuleerd, ondersteunt de voorspellingen van het toestandsregulatiemodel (voor een overzicht zie: Sergant, 2005; van der Meere 2002; Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010).\r\nHet “Delay Aversion model” stelt dat prestaties van kinderen met ADHD hoofdzakelijk worden beinvloed door intolerantie voor uitstel. Kinderen met ADHD zouden zwakker presteren dan typisch ontwikkelende kinderen in uitgestelde situaties. Volgens dit model is het primair tekort dat aan de grondslag ligt van de symptomen van ADHD een verstoorde codering van toekomstige beloningen. Na verloop van tijd zou dit primaire tekort leiden tot het ontwikkelen van negatief affect ten aanzien van situaties waar men moet wachten (Sonuga-Barke et al., 2010). Onderzoek ondersteunt de voorspellingen van dit model. Meer bepaald stelde men vast dat kinderen met ADHD een sterke voorkeur hebben voor kleine onmiddellijke beloningen boven grotere uitgestelde beloningen. Bovendien lijken kinderen met ADHD gefrustreerd te zijn wanneer een wachttijd extern wordt opgelegd (Marco et al., 2009).",

      "abstract": "Резюме. Диагностика пароксизмальных состояний в неврологии — одна из самых сложных проблем. Особые трудности вызывает дифференциальная диагностика эпилептических и неэпилептических пароксизмальных нарушений ввиду отсутствия абсолютно достоверных клинических маркеров заболевания в межпароксизмальный период, не всегда достаточной информативности инструментальных методов исследования и недостаточной осведомленности врачей. Неэпилептические пароксизмальные нарушения ошибочно диагностируют как эпилепсию в 20–30% случаев даже в медицинских центрах третьего уровня. Ложная положительная диагностика эпилепсии имеет место в 2–71% случаев. Двигательные нарушения, характеризующиеся внезапными преходящими эпизодами патологической непроизвольной двигательной активности, такие как хорея, атетоз, неэпилептические миоклонии, дистония, пароксизмальная дискинезия, нарушение координации произвольных двигательных актов или сочетанные нарушения координации и непроизвольной двигательной активности (пароксизмальная атаксия), представляют значительные диагностические трудности даже для высококвалифицированных специалистов. Нет абсолютно патогномоничных признаков эпилептических и неэпилептических припадков. В статье приведены основные клинические и нейрофизиологические критерии дифференциальной диагностики эпилепсии и ряда двигательных нарушений. Лечебная тактика больных с эпилептическими приступами, которые должны быть дифференцированными с пароксизмальными двигательными нарушениями, имеет ряд особенностей. После установления диагноза «эпилепсия» назначают противоэпилептические препараты широкого спектра действия, не оказывающие негативного влияния на когнитивные функции и не требующие длительного титрования дозы. В таких случаях препаратом выбора может быть леветирацетам, который эффективен при большинстве эпилептических припадков, может эффективно применяться во взрослой и детской практике, не вызывает аггравации припадков, имеет минимальные побочные действия, может быть назначен сразу в терапевтической дозе, кроме того, эффективен при ряде двигательных нарушений и при сочетании эпилепсии с двигательными нарушениями.",

      "title": "Stroke, Body Image, and Self Representation: Psychoanalytic and Neurological Perspectives",
      "abstract": "Stroke, Body Image, and Self Representation provides a psychoanalytic reading of the subjective difficulties encountered by patients who have suffered a stroke. The book is based on the words of stroke patients and on their self-portraits, which are then compared with the words and portraits of subjects devoid of brain lesions. Pathological and normal self-portraits illustrate in very concrete terms the libidinal investment of our body parts.\nThe author's original data sheds an entirely new light on the subjective effects of a stroke. On the one hand, the permanent sequelae of a stroke can cause a narcissistic injury; on the other, a stroke may affect the brain circuitry involved in the patient's body image, undoing the normal narcissistic reactions. This may happen after right hemisphere lesions and cause spectacular symptoms, such as the personification of a paralyzed hand or the apparent ignorance of a severe paralysis. This double aspect of a stroke is no small problem for rehabilitation therapists, who must avoid two pitfalls: considering any issue as psychological in nature, as if the brain lesion could not produce any organic changes, or, on the contrary, attributing any behavioural problems to brain dysfunction, as if the patient was devoid of normal psychological reactions. One of the aims of this book is to help therapists gaining their bearings in this little-known field. 　\nIn addition to this clinical interest, the author's psychoanalytic reading brings an original contribution to the physiopathology of cognition and self-representation. The data gathered by Catherine Morin show that self-representation cannot be considered only a cognitive operation. They also suggest that normal cognitive activity relies on both the stability of body image and the repression of the object. Stroke, Body Image, and Self Representation will appeal to psychoanalysts, psychologists, social workers, psychotherapists, psychiatrists, and rehabilitation therapists working with stroke survivors and patients with body image disorders.",

      "abstract": "Gilles de la Tourette syndrome (GTS) is characterized by multiple motor and vocal tics. Adult-onset cases are rare and may be due to \"reactivation\" of childhood tics, or secondary to psychiatric or genetic diseases, or due to central nervous system lesions of different etiologies. Late-onset psychogenic motor/vocal tics resembling GTS have been described. Neurophysiology may serve to differentiate organic from functional GTS. Altered blink reflex pre-pulse inhibition (BR-PPI), blink reflex excitability recovery (BR-ERC), and short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) have been described in GTS. We report a 48-years-old male, who developed numerous motor/vocal tics 2 months after sustaining non-commotional craniofacial trauma in a car accident. Both his father and brother had died earlier in car crashes. He presented with blepharospasm-like forced lid closure, forceful lip pursing, noisy suction movements, and deep moaning sounds, occurring in variable combinations, without warning symptoms or internal \"urge.\" Tics showed low distractibility and these increased with attention. Standard magnetic resonance imaging, electroencephalography, and evoked potentials were unremarkable. Neuropsychology diagnosed moderately impaired intellect, attention, and executive functions. Psychiatric assessment revealed somatization disorder and generalized anxiety. BR-PPI was unremarkable, while BR-ERC was enhanced, even showing facilitation at short intervals. SICI was markedly reduced at 1 and 3 ms and intracortical facilitation (ICF) was enhanced at 10 ms. The patient fulfilled Fahn and Williams' diagnostic criteria for a psychogenic movement disorder. Neurophysiology, however, documented hyperexcitability of motor cortex and brainstem. We suggest that-similar to what has been reported in psychogenic dystonia-a pre-existing predisposition may have led to the functional hyperkinetic disorder in response to severe psychic stress.",

      "abstract": "The notion of psychosis has historically been approached either as a continuous or discontinuous process with successive phases, or as a fixed categorical morbid entity. The notion of emergent psychosis wagers that the various evolutions will result in their possible positive inflection (both spontaneously and thanks to care). The priority then is to provide the earliest and most effective care possible before treating the chronicity, effects, aftereffects, and disabilities . . . Today, the notions of vulnerability, prodrome, and premorbid state are becoming increasingly better defined. As a result, prevention devices and therapeutic tools can be identified in an interactive relationship in which the observed is not the object of the observer, but always a subject meeting another, in an organized relationship.",

      "abstract": "Summary Background Emotion processing is essential for well-being and psychosocial adaptation. Alexithymia is widely viewed as an impairment in emotion processing that includes difficulty identifying and describing emotions. While there is a significant understanding of primary alexithymia, which is thought to be the result of developmental genetic and familial factors, secondary and organic alexithymia are beginning to be focus of research. Method and results The present review of the literature suggests the importance of differentiating between primary and secondary alexithymia, and the organic subtype of secondary alexithymia. Secondary alexithymia is thought to be a consequence of psychological stress, chronic disease, or organic processes (e.g. brain trauma or stroke) that occur after childhood (whereas primary alexithymia is a developmental phenomenon). Organic insults to the brain may bring about the organic form of alexithymia by altering cerebral structures involved in emotional processing (e.g. anterior cingulate cortex, frontostriatal networks, callosum corpus, right hemisphere cortex and amygdala). The usefulness of differentiating among alexithymia categories and their relationships with brain structures known to subserve emotional processing is discussed.",

Parasomnias are classified according to the type of sleep in which they occur, namely non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep parasomnias (1). The first includes disorders of arousals, namely confusional arousals (and their recently identified variants of sleep-related abnormal sexual behaviors), sleep terrors, and sleepwalking. REM sleep parasomnias include REM sleep behavior disorder, recurrent isolated sleep paralysis, and nightmare disorders. Other parasomnias include sleep enuresis, sleep-related groaning, exploding head syndrome, sleep-related hallucinations, and sleep-related eating disorder. The latter shares many features with the disorders of arousals, being frequently associated to sleepwalking. Hence, parasomnias comprise a variety of abnormal sleep-related movements, behaviors, emotions, dreaming, and autonomic phenomena that emerge from sleep as an expression of an anomalous central nervous system activation during sleep.",

      "abstract": "Psychological traumas may occur during childhood in the form of physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, physical neglect, and/or emotional neglect. Trauma may be experienced when a person experiences serious loss or his/her life is under grave threat. If such traumatic event is neither dealt effectively nor resolved completely, it may predispose such a person to development of mental health issues such as drug dependence including alcohol dependence syndrome (ADS). Persons who experience or suffer from childhood psychological trauma tend to consume alcohol in order to cope with their trauma related experiences. Hence, generally, onset of alcohol dependence is preceded by the occurrence of childhood psychological trauma(s). Childhood psychological trauma especially emotional abuse acts as a risk factor for the development of alexithymia in later life among persons with alcohol dependence. Alexithymia is a state of emotional dysregulation, which is characterized by the triad of difficulty in identifying one's own feelings, difficulty in distinguishing between the physical sensation and emotional arousal, and difficulty in explaining one's own feelings to others, which is known as externally oriented style of thinking. Alexithymia is itself a risk factor for the development of ADS. Thus, both childhood psychological trauma(s) and alexithymia play a significant role in the development of ADS. Findings of the present study showed that childhood psychological trauma(s), alexithymia, and ADS are interconnected. The present study findings conclude that significant relationship exists between childhood psychological traumas, alexithymia, and ADS.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Objectives Currently utilized clinician-rated symptom scales for tardive dyskinesia (TD) have not kept up with the expanding spectrum of TD phenomenology. The objective of this study was to develop and test the reliability of a new instrument, the CTI. Methods A movement disorder neurologist devised the outline of the scale. A steering committee (four neurologists and two psychiatrists) provided revisions until consensus was reached. The resulting instrument assesses frequency of abnormal movements of the eye/eyelid/face, tongue/mouth, jaw, limb/trunk, complex movements (e.g., handwringing, self-caressing), and vocalizations. The CTI rates symptoms from 0–3 with 0 = absent, 1 = infrequent/intermittent or only present with activating maneuvers, 2 = frequent intermittent, brief periods without movements, 3 = constant or nearly constant. Functional impairments including activities of daily living (ADL), social impairment, symptom bother, and harm are rated 0–3 with 0 = patient is unaware or unaffected, 1 = symptoms mildly impact patient, 2 = symptoms moderately impact patient, 3 = symptoms severely impact patient. Following institutional review board approval, the CTI underwent inter-rater and test-retest reliability testing. Videos of patient TD examinations were obtained and reviewed by two movement disorder specialists to confirm the diagnosis of TD by consensus and the adequacy to demonstrate a TD-consistent movement. Vignettes were created to include patients’ symptom descriptions and functional, social, or occupational impairments/limitations. Four clinicians rated each video/vignette. Selected videos/vignettes were also subject to an intra-rater retest. Interrater agreement was analyzed via 2-way random-effects interclass correlation (ICC) and test-retest agreement assessment utilizing Kendall’s tau-b. Results 45 video/vignettes were assessed for interrater reliability, and 16 for test-retest reliability. ICCs for movement frequency were as follows: abnormal eye movement .89; abnormal tongue/mouth movement .91; abnormal jaw movement .89; abnormal limb movement .76; complex movement .87; abnormal vocalization .77; and functional impairments including harm .82; social embarrassment .88; ADLs .83; and symptom bother .92. Retests were conducted on mean (SD) 15 (3) days later with scores ranging from .66–.87. Conclusions The CTI is a new instrument with good reliability in assessing TD symptoms and functional impacts. Future validation study is warranted. Funding Neurocrine Biosciences",

Does this mean that the underdevelopment of or damage to the frontal lobes will result in immorality? Probably not, but how about amorality? Enter the orbitofrontal syndrome. This syndrome is in many ways the opposite of the dorsolateral syndrome. Patients with orbitofrontal syndrome are emotionally disinhibited. Their affect is rarely neutral, constantly oscillating between euphoria and rage, with impulse control ranging from poor to nonexistent. Their ability to inhibit the urge for instant gratification is severely impaired. They do what they feel like doing when they feel like doing it, without any concern for social taboos or legal prohibitions. They have no foresight of the consequences of their actions. A patient afflicted with the orbitofrontal syndrome (due to head injury, cerebrovascular illness, or dementia) will engage in shoplifting, sexually aggressive behavior, reckless driving, or other actions commonly perceived as antisocial. These patients are known to be selfish, boastful, puerile, profane, and sexually explicit. Their humor is off-color and their jocularity, known as Witzelsucht, resembles that of a drunken adolescent.",

Batten and Gibb 3 simultaneously with Steinert, 4 in 1909, clarified the disease complex and separated it from other forms of myotonia. Myotonia atrophica is a hereditary disease which characteristically occurs in the third or fourth decade and progresses slowly thereafter until death in the sixth or seventh decade. The most constant course is myotonia, a tonic spasm of muscle, followed by atrophy. The myotonia is usually demonstrable by voluntary, mechanical, or electrical means in the muscles of the forearms, hands, tongue, and jaw. Myotonia occurs when the muscle is strongly stimulated as in a tight grip; it disappears with repetition of the stimulus; and it is intensified by cold. When the patient is",

When no moment of trauma is recalled, then an assumption is made that an injury is the result of overuse. In this article, I will argue that there is insufficient evidence to support this extensive use of the term “overuse” and that there are problems associated with using it. Thus, we should avoid the term, which implies the cause of the injury, until we have proof of the cause.\n\nOveruse injury is now categorised in medical subject headings as “cumulative trauma disorder (CTD)”. This is a subcategory of sprains and strains. CTD is defined as a “Harmful and painful condition caused by overuse or overexertion of some part of the musculoskeletal system, often resulting from work-related physical activities. It is characterized by inflammation, pain, or dysfunction of the involved joints, bones, ligaments, and nerves.” The term includes overuse injury, overuse syndrome, repetition strain injury, repetitive strain injury, and repetitive motion disorders. As CTD is defined as being caused by overuse, this definition fails to clarify the meaning of overuse injury. Overuse probably implies there is an amount of use that is excessive, and if use reaches or exceeds that amount then injuries arise.\n\nConsider now this term as used in sports medicine. Traumas, such as a fractured tibia caused by a tackle in soccer, are likely to be most common among players who play or train most. Yet, overuse is not said to be the cause of this injury. Injuries arising from obvious trauma are excluded from the category of overuse injuries. Such a trauma may be witnessed or may be felt as an acute moment of injury. An …",

      "abstract": "Myoclonus is a hyperkinetic movement disorder defined as brief, shock-like jerks caused by muscular contractions or inhibitions. The neuroanatomical localization of myoclonus spans the CNS with origins in the cortex, brainstem, or spinal cord. Electrophysiologic studies (for example, EEG, multichannel surface EMG, long-latency EMG responses to nerve stimulation, EEG–EMG back-averaging, and somatosensory evoked potentials) can assist in determining its localization. These studies can also help in distinguishing myoclonus from other hyperkinetic disorders (e.g., tremor, tics, dystonia, myokymia). The potential etiologies of myoclonus are numerous and include several neurodegenerative diseases, such as multiple system atrophy (MSA).",

Cerebral ischaemia may result from vaso‐vagal syncope or vago‐vagal syncope, the latter being associated with an abrupt fall in blood pressure. Many events may precipitate syncope and convulsions: rectal examinations, micturition syndrome, tussive syncope, ingestion of food and liquids (i.e. the Banquet Syndrome) are some examples. Sudden death may occur due to stress, the causal mechanisms usually involving the cardiovascular system. Cardiac dysrhythmia is frequently implicated. Stress may incude a broad variety of autonomic responses mediated often through the vagal system resulting in syncope, seizures and fatal collapse. The higher nervous system may also modify autonomic electrical activity of the heart with the same consequences.",

If the patient has parkinsonism, the first priority is to determine whether there is a reversible cause, most commonly a medication. If the patient has parkinsonism not due to a reversible cause, consider pharmacological treatment with carbidopa–levodopa or a dopamine agonist. Also refer to physical therapy for balance training and education on how to reduce fall risk. Importantly, multiple concussion-related parkinsonism is not the same as Parkinson’s disease. Injury-related parkinsonism does not usually get worse over time and can stay stable over decades.",

      "abstract": "The characteristic feature of all movement disorders is an abnormality of the form and velocity of movements of the body. The term ‘movement disorder’ has become synonymous with basal ganglia disease and extrapyramidal features. Although many movement disorders do arise from pathology within the basal ganglia, disorders such as myoclonus may also arise from other structures. Abnormality of movement may be the only manifestation of a disease process, or may be part of a more widespread neurological disorder. It is important not to divorce the disorder of movement from general medical problems, since these may be directly or indirectly related (for example, chorea in systemic lupus erythematosus; DIP caused by amiodarone). Basal ganglia disease is commonly associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms and these may have a greater impact upon the patient and their family than the movement disorder itself. An essential first step in the approach to the patient with a movement disorder is to correctly determine the phenomenology of the problem (for example, is the dominant problem chorea or dystonia?). Once this first step has been made, appropriately targeted investigations may then be required to determine the diagnosis. Thereafter, consideration is given to treatment, based upon clinical and social factors, as well as patient preference. This overview will describe a practical approach to the patient with a movement disorder. It will also briefly consider some broad principles in the investigation and management of such cases.",

Symptoms of intrusive posttraumatic reminders and avoidance interfere with the normal process of bereavement, preventing resolution of both the trauma and grief. The treatment model being presented, trauma-focused cognitive-behavioral therapy for children and their parents, is a manualized treatment approach that has been developed from years of empirically based work with trauma victims. Posttraumatic reactions, including post-traumatic stress disorder and acute stress disorder, are characterized by symptoms of increased arousal, avoidance of thoughts, feelings, and/or other external stimuli in order to minimize distressing memories, and reexperiencing phenomena. Traumatic events are outside the realm of ordinary experience and therefore, are typically incompatible with existing cognitive constructs. The cognitive immaturity of children may complicate recovery from traumatic loss.",

Sometimes the emergency is clearly referable to primitive psychiatric illness. Other times, psychiatric and organic symptoms can independently coexist (comorbidity), or develop together in different conditions of substance abuse, including alcohol and prescription drugs. Differentiating between substance induced and pre-existing psychiatric disorder (dual diagnosis) may be difficult, other than controversial issue. Finally, an organic disease can hide behind a psychiatric disorder (pseudopsychiatric emergency). In this review (part I), psychiatric disorders that occur with organic symptoms are discussed. They include: (1) anxiety, conversion and psychosomatic disorders, and (2) simulated diseases. The physiologic mechanisms of the stress reaction, divided into a dual neuro-hormonal response, are reviewed in this section: (1) activation of the sympathetic nervous system and adrenal medulla with catecholamine production (rapid response), and (2) activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis with cortisol production (slow response). The concept of the fight-or-flight response, its adaptive significance and the potential evolution in paralyzing response, well showing by Yerkes-Dodson curve, is explained. Abnormal short- and long-term reactions to stress evolving toward well codified cluster of trauma and stressor-related disorders, including acute stress disorder, adjustment disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder, are examined. A brief review of major psychiatric disorder and related behaviour abnormalities, vegetative symptoms and cognitive impairment, according to DMS IV-TR classification, are described. Finally, the reactive psychic symptoms and behavioral responses to acute or chronic organic disease, so called \"somatopsychic disorders\", commonly occurring in elderly and pediatric patients, are presented.

Learned helplessness is characterized by inhibition of cognitive, emotional, and motor functions. Therefore, learned helplessness is considered as a model of human depression. The study of learned helplessness is theoretically viable because this phenomenon affects certain fundamental properties of the nervous system — this condition is observed not only in the representatives of all classes of vertebrates, but also in invertebrates. Besides, the condition was modeled on certain ganglia of the cockroach. The key factor for the formation of learned helplessness is the stimulus uncontrollability, i. e. the inability to adapt to the stimulus, the inability to avoid or get rid of its action, or the inability to predict the appearance of this stimulus.",

Several types of psychopathology are associated with TS. The psychopathologies are too, for the most part, heterogeneous. Controversy has always reigned as far as the links between the various psychopathologies associated with TS. Suggestions as to the etiologies of the various associated psychopathologies are given. Thereafter, a brief overview of the psychopathologies is given. Finally, the rationale is given for the decision, and three psychopathologies are described in detail, namely obsessive—compulsive disorder (OCD), depression, and autistic spectrum disorder (ASD). It is suggested that the psychopathology of TS may well be described and divided as follows: (i) obsessive—compulsive behaviors (OCB) (integral and genetically related); (ii) attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (common, and genetically related in some cases only); (iii) depression (common and multifactorial in etiology); (iv) anxiety (secondary to having TS); (v) other psychopathologies that may be related to co-morbidity rather than to TS per se (e.g., personality disorder); (vi) psychopathology as a result of referral bias; (vii) psychopathology secondary to medication; and (viii) other disorders, which require further investigation (e.g., ASDs, rage, and bipolar affective disorder [BAD]).

      "abstract": "The disorders under consideration are the result of identifiable conditions. Historically, an arbitrary distinction has been made between \"organic\" conditions, associated with a presumably clear pathological basis, and \"functional\" conditions, or psychiatric disorders that lacked obvious disease processes. Delirium, however, is a disorder of cognitive dysfunction that lacks a well-understood pathophysiology despite unequivocal association with multiple and various medical conditions. More generally, delirium and dementia are frequently complicated by psychopathology (for example, delusions or changes in mood) traditionally associated with so-called functional disorders (schizophrenia and affective disorders, respectively). The organic/functional distinction obscured the propensity of medical conditions (e.g., thyroid dysfunction) to present with psychiatric symptoms that resolved after effective treatment of the nonpsychiatric condition. The nosological conventions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) (1) allow recognition of syndromes of disseminated cognitive dysfunction, such as delirium and dementia, as well as the psychopathology that is the product of various and multiple medical conditions without obscuring the need to consider these entities in the differential diagnosis of \"functional\" symptomatology. Regardless of the evolution of diagnostic convention, the illnesses described in this chapter can present to the psychiatrist as a \"mental\" condition or present to other medical specialists as \"medical\" conditions.",

      "abstract": "Objetivo: Analisar as características do Transtorno de Estresse Pós-Traumático (TEPT). Revisão bibliográfica: O TEPT é uma doença psicológica que pode surgir depois que uma pessoa experimenta um ou mais eventos traumáticos, como combate militar, trauma físico devido a lesão ou outros acidentes, como violência doméstica, estupro, trauma de infância, negligência ou abuso. Este se manifesta com sintomas dramáticos de hiperexcitação, lembranças memoriais intrusivas, pesadelos e flashbacks somatossensoriais. É frequentemente acompanhado por comorbidades psiquiátricas, como depressão, abuso de substâncias ou transtornos de ansiedade, o que leva a um alto nível de incapacidade funcional. Considerações finais: O TEPT consiste no desenvolvimento de sintomas relacionados ao estressor após um ou mais eventos traumáticos. Seus sintomas geralmente são classificados em três grupos: intrusão, evitação, e excitação com efeitos preponderantes no sono com insônia e pesadelo. O tratamento farmacológico é feito com Inibidores Seletivos de Recaptação de Serotonina ou Inibidores Seletivos de Recaptação de Norepinefrina, cujos efeitos colaterais são bem tolerados. Nesse sentido, é essencial um diagnóstico precoce e um tratamento multidisciplinar com um médico psiquiatra e um psicólogo a fim de minimizar os impactos do transtorno.",

      "abstract": "Abstract During maternal separation, some primate and nonprimate species show a biphasic (active/passive) response. The second stage is characterized by reduced activity, a hunched body posture, and other behaviors. Traditionally, the second stage has been referred to as “despair” and is considered an animal model for human depression. Recent research in psychoneuroimmunology suggests an alternative hypothesis—that behaviors occurring during the second passive phase represent stress‐induced “sickness behaviors.” This perspective more readily accounts for findings in widely divergent species, does not require assumptions regarding the ability to express complex emotional states, is empirically testable, and aligns the separation model with recent hypotheses regarding the nature and ontogeny of depressive illness. © 2001 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.

      "title": "Mouse Models of Depression",
      "abstract": "Depression-associated endophenotypes in miceMimicking any human behavioural trait in a mouse is extremely difficult, which makes the undertaking to try and model a multifactorial disease such as depression nearly impossible.How do we recapitulate all aspects of depression in an animal, when the criteria used to classify a major depression are of extreme heterogeneous and sometimes even of opposite nature (e.g., substantial weight gain or loss, insomnia or hypersomnia)?On top of that, animals not only lack consciousness of self, self-reflection and consideration of others but also aspects of the disorder such as depressed mood, low self-esteem or suicidality (Deussing JM, 2006).This does not mean that it is impossible to develop useful animal models, but rather highlights the unlikelihood of generating a model that will mirror the full extent of a given human neuropsychiatric disorder (Nestler and Hyman, 2010).Nonetheless, in depression, as well as other mood disorders, certain endophenotypes can be reproduced independently and evaluated in animals (Table 1).As mentioned above, these include physiological, endocrinological, neuroanatomical and behavioural alterations, many of which can be measured in mice.So far a variety of different mouse models have been established to improve our understanding of the pathophysiology of a wide spectrum of psychiatric diseases.However, a full consensus regarding the prerequisites of a valid animal model is still lacking in the scientific community.Up to now, the three criteria set up by McKinney and Bunney (McKinney and Bunney, 1969) are still widely accepted; they include construct validity, face validity, and predictive validity.Construct (or etiologic) validity, the most complex of the three terms, requires that the symptoms produced in the animal model are based on the same underlying neurobiological mechanisms as in humans.Thus, one tries to recreate mechanisms/processes in the animal which would also initiate the disease in humans (Nestler and Hyman, 2010).The ideal way would be to introduce a known human disease-causing gene variant into a mouse and thereby alter intracellular mechanisms, which in the end lead to the disease (Chadman et al., 2009).Unfortunately this is currently far from being realistic, since most disease-causing genetic alterations have not been established with certainty and the probability that a single gene is solely responsible for the disease is highly unlikely.In addition, an animal model does not have to be based on a genetic change, but can also be subject to an environmental challenge or a combination of both.Face validity is achieved when the animal exhibits specific symptoms of the disease which are similar in the human condition.These can be of biochemical, anatomical, neuropathological or behavioural nature.Thus the concept of face validity can also be regarded as the attempt to reproduce certain endophenotypes which can be accurately measured in the animal.Finally, predictive validity refers to the ability of the animal to correctly respond to pharmacological treatment, which should correlate with results from clinical trials.In this context, it is important to note that the more criteria the proposed model meets, the more compelling it will be (Malkesman et al., 2010).Simply put, researchers are faced with the challenge of 1) constructing a model with similarity in disease progression and symptomatology to humans, 2) detecting these phenotypes with the appropriate behavioural tests and 3) reverting them with treatment modalities that are also effective in humans.www.intechopen.comPsychiatric Disorders -Trends and Developments 188 DSM-IV symptoms Endopenotypes in mice Appropriate test/analysis Depressed or irritable mood Cannot be modeled Decreased interest or loss of pleasure Anhedonia Sucrose preference Intracranial self-stimulation Conditioned place-preferance Female urine sniffing Weight gain or loss Can easily be measured Abnormal loss or gain of weight after stress Insomnia or hypersomnia Abnormal sleep architecture Assessed by electroencephalogram recordings How to referenceIn order to correctly reference this scholarly work, feel free to copy and paste the following:",

They are characterized by changes in affect and in emotional response and may be pseudopsychopathic, pseudodepressive, or a combination of both. Cognitive ability (eg, verbal fluency, maintaining attention, achieving goals) may also be diminished. Neurologic signs may include abnormal reflexes, increased or decreased motor behavior, and loss of ability to complete purposeful movement. If the damage is caused by trauma, treatment begins with care of the acute injury. Any resulting seizures should be treated with an anticonvulsant and the patient observed carefully for side effects. Another agent (eg, a stimulant, antipsychotic, tricyclic antidepressant) may be needed as well, depending on the individual patient, to restore as much psychological function as possible. Counseling of both the patient and the family is important to help them avoid some difficulties and frustrations that may accompany the change in personality.",

      "abstract": "La discinesia tardia se observo por primera vez como un efecto secundario tardio de los farmacos antipsicoticos a finales de la decada de 1950. Aparece como movimientos involuntarios simples o complejos, repetitivos e involuntarios que tipicamente afectan la cara y las extremidades, aunque puede afectar cualquier grupo muscular del cuerpo. La etiologia de la discinesia tardia permanece desconocida, pero dado que a veces se pueden observar movimientos similares en pacientes con esquizofrenia no tratados, actualmente se considera que representa una interaccion entre el tratamiento farmacologico y algun aspecto del proceso de la propia enfermedad. Los movimientos involuntarios de la discinesia tardia son muy similares a los observados en trastornos neurologicos como la coreoatetosis y la distonia, por lo que desde hace mucho tiempo se sospecha que los ganglios basales desempenan un papel clave en su patogenesis. Sin embargo, los estudios de imagenes estructurales, primero usando tomografia computerizada (TC) y posteriormente con resonancia magnetica (RM), no han encontrado evidencia consistente de que la discinesia tardia este asociada con cambios de volumen en estas u otras estructuras cerebrales. El objetivo del presente estudio fue examinar si existian cambios estructurales cerebrales asociados a la discinesia tardia, utilizando imagenes estructurales basadas en voxeles de todo el cerebro. Se compararon grupos relativamente grandes de pacientes con esquizofrenia con y sin discinesia tardia. Tambien se examino a un grupo de controles sanos. Treinta y dos pacientes con esquizofrenia con discinesia tardia y 49 pacientes sin discinesia tardia, apareados por edad, sexo y coeficiente intelectual premorbido, fueron examinados usando morfometria optimizada basada en voxeles de todo el cerebro. Tambien se examino un grupo de comparacion de 61 adultos sanos, bien apareados con ambos grupos de pacientes por edad, sexo y nivel intelectual premorbido. Los pacientes con discinesia tardia mostraron un patron de reducciones de volumen en el lobulo frontal, temporal, y en estructuras subcorticales, como el talamo y los ganglios basales, en comparacion con los pacientes sin discinesia tardia. Dentro de los ganglios basales, se observaron reducciones de volumen en el nucleo caudado, en menor medida en el putamen, y solo marginalmente en el globo palido. Los pacientes con discinesia tardia mostraron reducciones significativas del volumen de los ganglios basales en comparacion con los controles sanos, pero el volumen de los ganglios basales no fue diferente entre los pacientes sin discinesia tardia y los controles. El presente estudio sugiere que el proceso o los procesos patologicos que subyacen a la discinesia tardia comportan alteraciones estructurales del cerebro.",

Exposure to emotional abuse significantly affects mental health across the lifespan and is particularly associated with elevated depression risk.This review examinesmechanisms, by which emotional abuse influences brain development and the neuroendocrine stress response system and discusses the roles of genetic vulnerability and epigenetic processes in contributing to an elevated mental health risk. Emotional abuse has similar effects on brain networks responsible for emotion processing and regulation as other maltreatment types.Moreover, it uniquely affects networks related to self-relevant information and socio-cognitive processes. Furthermore, emotional abuse is associated with an impaired recovery of the neuroendocrine response to acute stress. Similar to other maltreatment types, emotional abuse is associated with epigenetic changes in genes regulating the neuroendocrine stress response system that are implicated in increased mental health risk.These findings suggest that emotional abuse has equally detrimental effects on children'smental health as physical or sexual abuse, warranting broader societal awareness and enhanced early detection efforts. Early interventions should prioritize emotion regulation, social cognition, self-esteemenhancement, and relationship- oriented approaches for victims of emotional abuse.",

Existen igualmente diferencias de genero entre hombres y mujeres tanto en el tipo de autolesion como en el nivel de la misma. EnglishSelf - injury behaviors have been related to different syndromes of anxiety, depression, attempted suicide and consummate suicide, bullying, and physical and/or sexual abuse. Similarly, this symptomatology has also been linked to syndromes that do not necessarily lead to an attempted suicide such as substance use and abuse, autism or schizophrenia. In this sense, these self - injury behaviors have been related to affective or attention need. The present study validates a questionnaire for the diagnosis, and subsequent treatment, of these self - injuries without suicidal intent. The results show that there are two sub - dimensions of self - injury: Self - injury above the skin and Self - injury below the skin.

The classical conditioning contributes to the development of hypersensitivity of respiratory passages to non-allergic stimuli, which are associated with recurrent experiences of bronchial irritation caused by infection or allergies. The instrumental learning appears to be related to the conditioning of certain emotional reactions (e.g. fear of separation, feeling of rejection). A psychogenic asthmatic attack is produced by the simultaneous influence of a number of factors, e.g. presence or absence of local irritation of bronchial mucosa, general state of child's health, amount of conditioning to non-allergic stimuli and arousal of certain emotional states. In other words, an asthmatic child, in good physical health and without respiratory infection or irritation, is less likely to have a psychogenic asthmatic attack while enjoying his play activities.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Environmental circumstances that result in ambiguity or conflict with the patterns of sensory stimulation may adversely affect the vestibular system. The effect of this conflict in sensory information may be dizziness, a sense of imbalance, nausea, and motion sickness sometimes even to seemingly minor daily head movement activities. In some, it is not only exposure to motion but also the observation of objects in motion around them such as in supermarket aisles or other places with visual commotion; this can lead to dizziness, nausea, or a feeling of motion sickness that is referred to as visual vertigo. All people with normal vestibular function can be made to experience motion sickness, although individual susceptibility varies widely and is at least partially heritable. Motorists learn to interpret sensory stimuli in the context of the car stabilized by its suspension and guided by steering. A type of motorist's disorientation occurs in some individuals who develop a heightened awareness of perceptions of motion in the automobile that makes them feel as though they may be rolling over on corners and as though they are veering on open highways or in streaming traffic. This article discusses the putative mechanisms, consequences and approach to managing patients with visual vertigo, motion sickness, and motorist's disorientation syndrome in the context of chronic dizziness and motion sensitivity.",

      "title": "Delayed Neuronal Degeneration Results from Endogenous Glutamate Excess",
      "abstract": "Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) causes clinical neurological dysfunction that may be acute, fluctuating, or progressive.1,2 The molecular basis for neuronal injury has not been elucidated, although antineuronal antibodies have been identified in some patients. Immune-mediated injury to vessels or to coagulation cascades that cause inflammatory vasculopathies or embolic or hemorrhagic phenomena can produce ischemia and neuron death, as in stroke, seizures, and spinal cord and peripheral nervous system disease.3 Questions about the mechanism of chronic neurological disease in SLE, such as encephalopathy, and cognitive and behavioral disorders, arise when the autoantibody markers for active SLE fail to correlate with the neurological symptoms.1,4,5 (For an alternate opinion, see ref. 6.) Some will argue that this failure amounts to inadequate methodology either in detection of autoantibodies or in detection of a cytokine imbalance that mediates central nervous system injury independent of autoantibodies. Alternatively, chronic or progressive neurological symptoms in SLE may not depend on the activity of the systemic disease. For example, neurologic disease in SLE could depend on nonimmune-mediated factors like infection and toxic effects of medications. There is another possible mechanism that would account for the failure of chronic or progressive neurological disease to correlate with systemic disease. Recent experiments in several different animal models suggest that an initial insult to the brain may initiate a cascade of events that ultimately lead to distal progressive neuron loss. Based on these studies it is possible that an immune insult could initiate injury and become resolved, but the neuron injury could continue in an expanding cascade without the presence of serum markers of immunologic disease. Building on experimental evidence that had demonstrated that the increased excitatory effect of glutamate and calcium influx causes neuronal death, studies on different animal models suggest that after an initial injury, neurons distant from the region of the first injury may die as the excitatory and inhibitory tone changes on downstream glutamate neurons.7–15 One experimental model demonstrated that ischemic or neurotoxic damage to the striatum caused, days later, the degeneration of 50% of the GABA neurons in the substantia nigra,13–15 although the substantia nigra was not damaged by the initial striatal injury. Behavioral changes in the animals correlated with the development of delayed neuronal degeneration.16 One possible mechanism for the delayed degeneration of GABA neurons in the substantia nigra reticulata depended on glutamatergic overactivity. A brief review of the critical feature of the anatomy of the striatonigral system shows that the substantia nigra reticulata receives inhibitory afferents from the striatum (caudate-putamen and globus pallidus), and excitatory glutamatergic afferents from the subthalamic nucleus. In the next experiment, ablation of the subthalamic nucleus occurred prior to the striatal injury. The nigral GABA neurons were completely protected from the endogenous excitotoxicity.14 These results suggest a central role for alterations of glutamate activity in chronic progressive neurological disease and raise the question of whether SLE cytokines or antibodies may provoke similar delayed neuronal injury by altering glutamatergic activity. In this hypothesis SLE cytokines or antibodies might affect upstream neurons and initiate a cascade of events that would evolve over a longer time, and lead eventually to neuronal death through overexcitation; alternatively SLE cytokines or antibodies might acutely affect glutamate receptors. This hypothesis would be plausible if SLE determined brain injury-affected neurons with excitatory or inhibitory activity on glutamatergic neurons or if SLE cytokines or antibodies demonstrated an effect on glutamate receptors. In fact, it has been demonstrated in SLE that microinfarcts and larger vessel occlusions destroy cortical, striatal, or thalamic brain regions with afferents to downstream glutamatergic neurons. Also, in SLE, defective regulation and function of interleukin-4, -6, and -10 have been recorded,17,18 and in vitro experiments have demonstrated that interleukin-6 protects neurons against glutamate-induced death.19 Interleukin-1-receptor antagonist also protects against excitotoxin-induced neuron death in in vivo experiments.20 Furthermore, some studies have identified a lymphocytotoxic antibody that cross-reacts with brain tissue.21 The recent finding, however, of autoantibodies to the glutamate receptor in patients with encephalitis and paraneoplastic syndrome22,23 may set the stage for a discovery of an autoantibody in SLE to the glutamate receptor. These data suggest that the search for the pathogenesis of the chronic neurological symptoms in SLE should also include the possibility that delayed neuronal degeneration may occur after the initial injury and need not necessarily associate with active SLE. Delayed neuronal degeneration might help explain the progressive or fluctuating neurologic impairments in systemic lupus erythematosus.",

      "abstract": "Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease is a motor and sensory neuropathy with clinical and genetic heterogeneity. Patients usually present in the first or second decade of life with distal muscle atrophy in the legs, areflexia, foot deformity (mainly pes cavus), and steppage gait. In most cases, hands are also involved as the disease progresses. CMT is the most frequent inherited neuropathy, with a prevalence in Spain of 28 in 100 000.1 Based on electrophysiological studies and histopathologic findings in nerve biopsies, CMT has been subcategorised into two main and distinct neuropathies: (i) demyelinating CMT (CMT1, MIM 118200) associated with reduction in a nerve conduction velocities (NCVs) in all nerves and segmental demyelination and remyelination (“onion bulbs”); and (ii) axonal CMT (CMT2, MIM 118220) associated with normal or almost normal NCVs and loss of myelinated axons. Other phenotypes are associated with motor and sensory nerve involvement: Dejerine-Sottas neuropathy (DSN, MIM 145900) is a severe demyelinating neuropathy with onset in infancy, delayed motor milestones, and NCVs less than 10 m/s; congenital hypomyelinating neuropathy (CHN, MIM 605253) is a dysmyelinating neuropathy characterised by infantile hypotonia, distal muscle weakness, and marked reduction of NCVs; hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP, MIM 162500) is a milder sensory and motor neuropathy with periodic episodes of numbness, muscular weakness, and atrophy.2\n\nGenetic heterogeneity is characteristic of the disease not just because of the large number of genes and loci associated with CMT (currently 21 genes),3–5 but also because the disease may segregate with different Mendelian patterns. The most frequent pattern of inheritance is autosomal dominant, but autosomal recessive and X linked segregation are also observed.\n\nThe relationship of the type of CMT, demyelinating or axonal, with specific genes is not perfect. For instance, MPZ mutations are usually manifested clinically as an autosomal dominant …",

      "abstract": "Le sommeil est un état physiologique et comportemental caractérisé par une isolation partielle de l'environnement. Lors du sommeil, un événement perturbateur comme la douleur peut provoquer une réaction de microéveil brève et inconsciente vers un réveil comportemental caractérisé par une réactivation thalamocorticale complète et un niveau plus élevé de conscience. Le sommeil devient alors fragmenté et les plaintes de douleur se trouvent souvent exacerbées. La continuité oscillatoire de 90–110 minutes, rythme ultradien du sommeil léger et profond (non-REM: rapid eye movement) vers le sommeil paradoxal (REM), est alors rompue. Chez un patient souffrant de céphalée, on observe trois périodes durant lesquelles surviennent les crises en relation avec le sommeil: 1) dans les heures avant l'initiation du sommeil, 2) durant et, 3) après le sommeil. La céphalée de tension et la migraine, la céphalée de type hypnique, l'algie vasculaire de la face (cluster headache) et l'hémicrânie paroxystique chronique peuvent survenir en relation avec le sommeil. Soulignons que la céphalée du réveil est parfois associée à du bruxisme (serrement et grincement des dents), à un abus de médications antalgiques, à de l'hypertension, à un trouble de l'humeur ou à des réductions du flux respiratoire lors du sommeil. Les céphalées suite à un traumatisme crânien sont fréquentes et causent de l'insomnie, des réveils subits et prématurés et surtout des matins pénibles avec délai de phase circadienne. Dans le contexte d'une céphalée survenant en relation avec l'insomnie ou la somnolence diurne, la recherche de troubles respiratoires du sommeil, d'intrusions sous forme de mouvements périodiques des membres ou de bruxisme est indiquée. La polygraphie peut être effectuée en laboratoire ou en ambulatoire. La gestion de ces céphalées suit les grands principes de la médecine contemporaine tout en visant une hygiène du sommeil maximale par thérapie cognitive et comportementale, le maintien d'un rythme circadien idéal, la prise de mélatonine, la correction du phénomène respiratoire. La prise d'hypnotique ne semble pas un traitement de choix à long terme.",

      "abstract": "Syncope, defined as a transient loss of consciousness due to transient global cerebral hypoperfusion, characterized by rapid onset, short duration, and spontaneous complete recovery, is a frequent symptom and can be attributed to different causes.1\n\nThe most common aetiology of syncope is a neurally mediated reflex that consists of a transient failure of the cardiovascular mechanisms that normally control haemodynamic stability. This reflex is usually triggered by different stimuli (afferent pathways), leading to sudden withdrawal of sympathetic activity and to an increase in parasympathetic nerve tone (efferent pathways), causing vasodilatation, with consequent hypotension, and bradycardia.\n\nThe clinical presentation of neurally mediated syncope is not usually uniform; however, it may manifest with different patterns. In some patients, it is initiated by clear adrenergic stimuli such as fear, pain, emotional distress, or medical instrumentation, whereas in others it develops after prolonged orthostatism, hypovolaemia, or carotid sinus stimuli. There are also many patients in whom reflex syncope develops without any apparent recognizable trigger. On the other hand, some patients complain of typical vegetative prodrome, whereas others develop sudden syncope without any warning symptom. In addition, although both mechanisms, hypotension and bradycardia, are, by definition, always present, the predominance of one or the other leads to the characteristic patterns of vasodepressor, mixed, or cardioinhibitory reflex syncope.2 Although all these situations share a common underlying mechanism, i.e. hypotension and bradycardia triggered by some afferent stimuli, these differences have a great impact on the diagnostic process and in therapeutic decisions. Whereas a syncopal episode in a young patient, with clear triggers and prodrome, is easy to diagnose and manage, sudden episodes, without recognizable triggers, particularly … \n\n*Corresponding author.

The excessive thoughts, feeling or behaviors related to the somatic symptoms or associated health concerns are demonstrated through one of three possible avenues. Considering the major anxiety disorders, the somatic symptoms in Panic Disorder tend to appear initially in discrete episodes. The occurrence of a medical illness does not eliminate the possibility of Illness Anxiety Disorder. The diagnosis can still be applied if the health-related anxiety and the concerns about the illness are significantly out of proportion. Somatic Symptom Disorder is differentiated from Illness Anxiety Disorder by virtue of the presence of a substantial somatic symptom(s).

The diagnostic criteria require that symptoms become apparent before a child is three years old. Autism affects information processing in the brain by altering how nerve cells and their synapses connect and organize. The prevalence of autism is about 1-2 per 1000 people worldwide and it occurs about four times more often in boys than girls. Parents usually notice signs in the first two years of their child's life. Early behavioral, cognitive or speech interventions can help autistic children gain self-care, social and communication skills.",

These events can leave the individual with intense terror, fear and paralysing helplessness. They can also disrupt the integrity of a person, and the sense that the world is predictable and safe. In a majority of exposures there is a gradual return to daily life with no residual symptoms. If symptoms persist or start to manifest and are related to the so called ‘index trauma’, the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) can be made. Over time, the events qualifying for traumatic stress have been extensively debated. It must be noted that prior and cumulative effects of trauma exposure are a particularly important determinant of risk for PTSD (Burback et al., 2023).",

It has a key role in higher mental functions such as motivation, planning, social behavior, and speech production. Frontal lobe syndrome reflects damage to the prefrontal regions of the frontal lobe. It is characterized by deterioration in behavior and personality in a previously normal individual. Cerebrovascular disease is one of major causes of frontal lobe syndrome. Case Report After weaking up from comma caused by subarachnoidal haemmoraghia and embolisation of arteria communicans, 48 year old patient was radically changed. His wife reported “He is not the same man”. He became erretic, euphoric, noncritical, sexually desinhibed, impulsive and easy frustrabile even agressive. His circadiary rythm was disrupted, he was sleaping invariably. Computer tommograpy shown “multiple ischemic lesions bifrontoparietalis”. After treatment some of symptoms are set under control but some persisted. Discussion There is no other part of the brain where lesions can cause such a wide variety of symptoms. These symptoms can roughly be divided into three main categories: cognitive, emotional and behavioural. Combination of presented symptoms can make diagnostic confusion. It may often be confounded with two psychiatric disorders: mania (or hypomania) and antisocial personality disorder.

Historically, they did not always belong to the ‘hysteria’ complex. The fact that they were added later has created interesting conceptual obstacles to their analysis. Conversive symptoms, however, cannot be said to be specific to hysteria; indeed, 50-80 per cent are reported to ‘coexist’ with other psychiatric disorders, most commonly depression (Guze et al. 1971; Lecompte 1987). In about 50 per cent of cases, some form of ‘personality disorder’ is also found (Binzer et al. 1997). But in 80 per cent, conversive symptoms are not associated with the so-called hysterical personality or Briquette’s syndrome (Marsden 1986).",

Jitteriness can be caused by a variety of pre-, peri-, and postnatal insults, and it is the nature and treatability of these, rather than the tremor itself, that are the major determinants of the ultimate prognosis. \"Coarse\" tremor is probably more often abnormal than \"fine\" tremor, and appears to bear some relationship to the later development of a choreiform syndrome.

Psycho(patho)dynamic analyses of suicidal acts disclosed that in a portion of the suicide attempts there is no or at least no determined suicidal intent. The definition of ‘suicidal attempt’ which has come into general use is therefore imprecise, because in many cases suicide is not “attempted” but the technique of suicidal behaviour is only used for a primary non-suicidal purpose. A differential typology of the entire content of the concept of ‘suicide attempt’ which includes vague non-homogeneous matters has become unavoidable and is being discussed here. In the suicidal behaviour of children the problems become even clearer. The ‘suicide attempt’ in children does not meet &lt;i&gt;Stengel&lt;/i&gt;’s criteria. The great majority of cases are not ‘attempted’ suicides, do not show a final determination, do not come about in a calculated manner, and are not based on an ambivalence about life and death, but are rather a potentially fatal substitution by suicidal behaviour for a demonstrative appeal for help, for a resigned escape signal or for an impulsive cry.

      "abstract": "Depression is a serious mental illness that can be debilitating. It can interfere with daily activities and cause feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and despair. It is a mental health condition that can range in severity from mild to severe. The severity of depression can be assessed based on the number, intensity, and duration of symptoms, as well as their impact on an individual's daily functioning. Mild depression typically involves symptoms such as feeling sad, low energy, and a lack of motivation. These symptoms may not significantly interfere with an individual's ability to function in their daily life, and they may still be able to maintain their social and occupational obligations. Moderate depression involves more severe and persistent symptoms, such as a sense of hopelessness, persistent feelings of sadness, and difficulty concentrating or making decisions. These symptoms may make it challenging to fulfill daily responsibilities, and may result in social isolation or problems at work or school. Severe depression involves symptoms that significantly impair an individual's ability to function in their daily life, such as suicidal thoughts, complete loss of interest in activities, and difficulty with basic tasks such as personal hygiene or eating. Severe depression is a medical emergency and requires immediate professional intervention to prevent harm to oneself or others",

      "abstract": "Impulsive-reactive violent offenders show increased autonomic activity in response to negative emotional and threatening stimuli. A volume reduction and/or activity decrease of frontal brain structures associated with impulse control and the regulation of fear and anger are likewise found in combination with a fear-related hyperactivity of the amygdala. In addition, impulsive aggression is facilitated by variants of gene polymorphisms influencing the serotonergic system. Conversely, proactive-instrumental violent offender with psychopathy, who are characterized by a lack of empathy and remorse, demonstrate an autonomic hypo-responsivity as well as dysfunctions of the amygdala and of cortical regions related to empathic and social behavior. Developmentally, aggressive children exhibit temperamental differences from early childhood on that are characteristic of a developmental pathway towards either reactive or proactive violence later in life. Exposure to negative environmental factors like ineffective parenting or childhood maltreatment has been related to a heightened risk for developing reactive violence. A developmental trajectory of proactive violence, however, has been related to a mostly genetically determined callous unemotional temperament of the child that disrupts the parental socialization efforts during childhood.",

      "abstract": "Tourette syndrome (TS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by early onset motor and vocal tics. Tics are brief, stereotypical, repetitive and non-rhythmic movements or phonations that typically follow a waxing and waning pattern of severity, intensity and frequency; they can be distinguished from other hyperkinetic movement disorders on the basis of their temporary voluntary suppression. TS should be differentiated from various movement disorders. We report a case of a young man who presented with torticollis, which was eventually attributed to TS. Case report A 21-year-old man was admitted to our clinic due to treatment resistant cervical dystonia attributed to neuroleptics. During the last five years he had been treated for depressed mood, somatic delusions and aggressive behaviour. He had been given SSRIs and atypical antipsychotics at low doses; six months prior to his admission he had been switched to risperidone. Present clinical examination revealed torticollis, motor stereotypies, vocal tics (sniffing, repetition of words), mental koprolalia and obsessive-compulsive symptoms. He complained of repetitive intrusive thoughts of harming his sister and thoughts of a ‘delusional’ nature regarding somatic complaints were also present. The patient was diagnosed as TS and was successfully treated accordingly. TS can mimic many hyperkinetic states. Whether patients with TS are at higher risk of developing dystonia, or tics and dystonia share a common pathophysiological mechanism (dopamine-inhibiting processes are probably involved in both conditions) is still debatable.",

      "abstract": "The diagnosis of epilepsy is always a s0.urce of sh?ck to the family and is frequently accompamed by anXIety concerning the cause. In extreme cases the diagnosis can even lead to suicide. Parents feel guilty and search for reasons why this has happened to one of their children. Is it attributable to some defect in their family, such as an alcoholic uncle or a mentally disturbed relative, or to their own misdeeds? The mother may blame herself for trying to avoid pregnancy, or for an attempted termination, or just not wanting the child. Arising from these deeply-felt feelings and anxieties the child may be rejected or overprotected. . The child who has epilepsy will have to grow up ID an atmosphere of anxiety about his condition. Parents are concerned about their responsibility and how far they can allow the child to follow a normal existence. There may be disputes about this, and as to how far the child should be subject to the same discipline as the other children. The child may endure many restrictions (swimming, riding a bicycle, etc), limitations on activities or going out with other children. Drugs may have to be taken-a nuisance in itself-and he will suffer the effects of taking drugs even if these are minimal. There may be difficulty in keeping up with schooling, and in many ways he will feel different from other children. Later the inability to drive a car may be a social handicap. Epilepsy, to the individual, means a ~reat deal ~f uncertainty. Will a seizure interfere with taking an exan:nnation or an interview for a job, or plans for some social activity or a holiday? Epileptics may feel that the risk. of causing a disturbance at a cinema or a dance by havIDg a seizure is too embarrassing, and so they become more and more isolated. All these factors play a significant role in the development of the individual and his per~onality. There is no clear evidence that epilepsy itself causes behavioural disturbance. Occasionally the underlying cause of the seizure may be responsible for disturbed behaviour in a child or some cases of temporal lobe epilepsy cause behavioural disorders. The extremes of epileptic personalitv are more often the sort of behaviour which follows lo~g periods of institutional care and it is r~re ~o find someone demonstrating the old textbook epileptic personality outside of an institution. Nevertheless, many people who suffer from epilepsy do have some degree",

Other monosymptomatic disorders are often referred to as essential tremor variants. Recent findings There is now solid evidence that essential tremor, however defined, is a syndrome with multiple causes. Summary A new tremor classification scheme is being developed by the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society Task Force on Tremor. In this scheme, tremor in the absence of other neurological signs is called isolated tremor, and tremor in combination with other signs is called combined tremor. Many isolated and combined tremor syndromes can be defined on the basis of commonly recurring or unique clinical symptoms and signs, including historical features (age at onset, family history, and temporal evolution) and tremor characteristics (body distribution, activation condition, associated features). Essential tremor, however defined, is simply a syndrome and not a specific disease. Essential tremor should be defined and used consistently, or this term should be abandoned. As essential tremor is an arbitrarily defined syndrome, it makes no sense to refer to other tremors as variants of essential tremor or essential tremor syndromes.",

Any lower extremity nerves—tibial, peroneal (superficial or deep), saphenous, and sural—can be involved. Some syndromes are more common, based on local factors that predispose the nerve to injury. Specific entities include the tarsal tunnel syndrome (with involvement of the tibial nerve at the ankle), jogger's foot (with involvement of the medial plantar nerve), first branch lateral plantar nerve entrapment, medial dorsal cutaneous nerve entrapment, and interdigital neuralgia. Typical symptoms include neuralgia (burning, shooting, lancinating, or radiating pain), tingling, or numbness along the distribution of the nerve's territory. Management includes activity modification, equipment adjustment, transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation unit, braces, rest, and medications (topical, oral, or via injection). When these are unsuccessful in resolving the symptoms, surgical release of the nerve may be considered. With proper management, return to athletic function is possible.",

It disrespects boundaries, interrupts all kinds of units and makes them blend, it disturbs bodily and psychic organisms and upsets social and historical organization. Some characteristics of the history of trauma have their origin in this situation. One of them is the gradual extension for instance of the notion of 'trauma' which makes the surgical 'wound' (greek: trauma) evolve into a bio-psycho-social phenomenon. Other characteristics of the history of trauma are its association with questions of endogenous versus exogenous causes of suffering and with the issue of guilt and its recurrent falling into oblivion. The paper traces the history of traumatogenic illness from the simple wound to forensically important damages like the 'railway-injuries' entitling to claims for damages, to 'traumatic-' and 'war-neuroses' and finally to the more or less endemic 'posttraumatic stress syndrome' of present time.",

Tricyclic antidepressants particularly of imipramine and clomipramine can have pro-suicidal effect, which is believed to be the consequence of their own hypothetic asynchronous cognitive-psychomotor pharmacodynamic action. Antidepressants from the group of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors can at the beginning of administration as monotherapy also have pro-suicidal effects in patients with hints of suicidality or suicidal behavior, by increasing the intensity of already present suicidal predictors, such as dysphoria, anxiety, impulsiveness, agitation etc. Antipsychotics can act stimulatingly upon predictors of suicidal behavior, that is, pro-suicidal in an indirect way through side effects they cause indirect pro-suicidal neurological and consecutive psychological impact, as it is called. It is particularly valid for classic antipsychotics causing primarily neurological, i.e. extrapyramidal side effects, along which consecutive psychological side effects can occur as well. However, new antipsychotics in comparison to classic ones, have less pronounced neurological, extrapyramidal symptoms and signs but more somatic-metabolic side effects, and thereby their action can be mostly manifested as indirect pro-suicidal neurological and somatic-metabolic as well as consecutive psychological activity.",

Involvement of the white matter tracts almost universally leads to motor involvement that manifests as hypotonia in early childhood and progresses to spasticity over time. This may lead to variable motor impairment, from mild spastic diplegia to severe spastic quadriplegia that limits purposeful movement. In addition, motor dysfunction is likely to significantly impair vital functions including swallowing, chewing, and (in some cases) respiration. Other findings that vary by disorder include extrapyramidal movement disorders (e.g., dystonia and/or dyskinesias), ataxia, seizures, and delay in cognitive development or change in cognitive function over time. Diagnosis/testing Establishing the specific leukodystrophy present in a given individual usually involves: Genetic counseling Leukodystrophies with an identified genetic cause may be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, an autosomal recessive manner, or an X-linked recessive manner. Genetic counseling regarding risk to family members depends on accurate diagnosis, determination of the mode of inheritance in each family, and results of molecular genetic testing. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible for some types of leukodystrophy if the pathogenic variant(s) in the family are known. Many leukodystrophies are still without an identified genetic cause; once a genetic cause is identified, other inheritance patterns may emerge. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is symptomatic and ideally occurs in a multidisciplinary setting by specialists experienced in the care of persons with a leukodystrophy. Pharmacologic agents are used to manage muscle tone and block neuronal signaling to muscle (chemodenervation). Intensive physical therapy is used to improve mobility and function. Pharmacologic treatment of dystonia and dyskinesias may result in significant functional improvement. Treatment of ataxia, seizures, and cognitive issues is provided in the usual manner, depending on the needs of the individual. Prevention of primary manifestations: In a few leukodystrophies primary disease manifestations can be prevented by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or bone marrow transplantation (BMT) early in the disease course. Surveillance: Routine assessment of growth and nutritional status; physical examination and/or serial x-rays of the hips and spine to monitor for orthopedic complications; and routine history regarding signs and symptoms of seizures. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Mild head injuries and infection as these may exacerbate disease manifestations. Evaluation of relatives at risk: When primary prevention of a leukodystrophy is possible (e.g., by HSCT or BMT), it is appropriate to offer testing to asymptomatic at-risk relatives who would benefit from early diagnosis and consideration of early treatment.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a chronic disabling; psychiatric disorder that affects around 1% of the population and its point prevalence is 0.6 to 8.3 cases per 1000 population. 1,2Caregiving in psychiatric illness is an exhausting and challenging activity that typically involves a considerable amount of energy, time and money over considerably long periods of time, in tasks that may be unpleasant or uncomfortable and could be psychologically and physically stressful and tiring.3\r\nCaregiving to mentally unstable people can be particularly challenging in traditional societies such as India. The close - knit family structure and lack of adequate government resources to support people with mental illness place the burden of care on the family which is perceived to be the ‘‘natural’’ caregiver. Socio-cultural expectations envision caregiving as an obligation and moral binding which is to be given by parents, children or the spouse. Religious-cultural attributions often causally implicate supernatural factors in the manifestation of mental illness.\r\nSchizophrenia is a severe mental disorder that usually starts in late adolescence or early adulthood, and is characterized by profound disruption in thinking, language, perception and the sense of self, and includes psychotic experiences, such as hearing voices or delusions. 6\r\nThe volatile nature of the disorder and its accompanying debilitating consequences burdens the family in multiple domains causing social, emotional and financial problems. Several studies had done worldwide reveal a high level of burden, social isolation and stigma among caregivers of schizophrenia. Indian data in this area is relatively sparse however some studies reports the presence of depression, anxiety, poor mental and physical health and other mental disorders among the caregivers. In view of the above the present study was undertaken to evaluate the quality of life and marital adjustment in spouses of schizophrenia patients.",

      "abstract": "At least three types of ictal atomic phenomena can be seen in partial seizures. Focal atomic seizures are partial seizures with ictal paresis or paralysis of one or more body parts preceding or independent of any convulsive activity. A diagnosis may be difficult without simultaneous EEG recording supplemented by video monitoring or polygraphy. Epileptic negative myoclonus manifests as brief lapses in tone in one or more muscle groups that interferes with motor coordination and postural control. Drop attacks can also occur in partial seizures, as have been well documented in patients with temporal or frontal lobe epilepsy. Different mechanisms may underlie these three phenomena. Focal atonic seizures probably result from relatively circumscribed seizure activity in one or more cortical areas that contribute to the elaboration and execution of motor functions. Whether this represents inactivation or interference in motor integration, or activation of inhibitory system, remains unresolved. The pathophysiology of epileptic negative myoclonus, like that of its positive counterpart, is probably to be found at a more local level, possibly from transiently enhanced local inhibition in the motor cortex. Drop attacks in partial seizures may be close in mechanism to that also seen in generalized seizures, possibly related to ictal activation of descending inhibitory pathways in the brainstem.",

TBI, especially if severe, can produce structural and functional modifications of the brain, which in turn can result in a highly variable and complex interaction of symptoms depending on the motor, sensory, cognitive, emotional, behavioural, and autonomic spheres. The brain during traumatic collision is prone to insults due to a complex combination of acceleration and deceleration and translation and rotation forces causing contusions, diffuse axonal injuries (DAI), and haemorrhages. Moreover, damages to neurons may occur as a consequence of biochemical modifications as a consequence of a drop in the levels of oxygen and glucose, and, finally, because of blood hypotension or increased intracranial pressure. This complex combination of and interaction among insults tends to produce a heterogeneous association of diffused and focalized damages that affect every possible area of the brain: cortical, subcortical, and midbrain. In addition, mild TBI can produce cerebral damage whose severity is directly correlated with the length of loss of consciousness and of post-traumatic amnesia",

      "title": "Epilepsy and Seizures",
      "abstract": "For more than a century, clinicians have observed a strong link between epilepsy and psychiatry as evidenced by frequent psychopathologies, psychosocial disturbances, and cognitive deficits among people with epilepsy. In many countries, until recently, epilepsy was conceptualized as a mental health disorder. Epilepsy can be associated not only with episodic behavioral disorders ictally and during the peri-ictal period but also with chronic behavioral disturbances interictally. Indeed, even when optimal seizure control is achieved and cognitive impairment is absent, epidemiological studies have shown greater vulnerability of people with epilepsy toward psychosocial distress (Sillanpää et al. 1998). A wide variety of etiologies affecting the central nervous system (CNS) can involve very similar behavioral signs and symptoms (Table 10–1 ). Primary signs and symptoms of central nervous system disturbances Cognitive Affective dysregulation Communication/language dysfunction Intellectual impairment Impaired judgment Dysmnesia/inattention Disorientation Behavioral Anxiety Alteration in arousal Mood (elevation, depression, apathy) Motor (hyperkinetic, hypokinetic, or akinetic) Personality traits/changes Dyspraxia Perceptions Auditory Gustatory Kinesthetic pain/paresthesias/anesthesia Olfactory Visual Source. Adapted from Tucker 2002, p. 674. In this chapter, we first provide an overview of the evaluation and management of epilepsy, focusing on the diverse neurobehavioral manifestations of seizures as influenced by seizure origin and extent of electrical propagation. In subsequent sections, we review the evaluation and management of the more common neuropsychiatric complications and comorbidities of the epilepsies and seizures.",

      "title": "Anesthetics",
      "abstract": "Abstract Anesthesia, which constitutes a state in which noxious events such as surgical procedures are imperceptible, may or may not be accompanied by loss of consciousness. A complete or general anesthetic given by the inhalation or intravenous routes produces hypnosis (profound sleep), analgesia, muscle relaxation, and protection against the increase in blood pressure and heart rate resulting from surgical stress (maintains homeostasis). An anesthetic which blocks the neural transmission of painful stimuli through afferent nerves and does not affect the level of consciousness can be classified as a local anesthetic. Induction of general anesthesia produces a progressive deepening of the anesthetic state and represents a descending desensitization of the central nervous system (CNS). A progression of clinical signs useful for estimating the depth of anesthesia. Four stages can be defined: first, a state of altered consciousness and analgesia begin; second, loss of consciousness, accompanied by irregular respiration and motor movement from depression of higher motor inhibitory centers with release of lower motor mechanisms, occurs; third, surgical anesthesia is reached, in which spinal cord and spinal reflexes are abolished, providing relaxation of skeletal musculature, and loss of corneal, conjunctival, pharyngeal, and laryngeal reflexes occurs progressively; fourth, onset of respiratory paralysis resulting from significant depression of the medullary respiratory center occurs, and subsequent cardiovascular collapse ensues. Monitoring via an electroencephalogram (EEG) and hemodynamic and blood gas monitoring help assess the depth of anesthesia. The potency of inhaled agents is expressed as the minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) that is required to prevent spontaneous movement in response to a surgical or equivalent stimulus in 50% of patients. The onset of action is fast (within 60 s) for the intravenous anesthetic agents and somewhat slower for inhalation and local anesthetics. Although the modern practice of anesthesia is exceedingly sophisticated, identification of the basic molecular mechanism underlying it is still lacking. Inhalational anesthetics are very diverse chemically and extrapolation from the effect of a particular agent to the physiological state of anesthesia is problematic. Anesthesia theories may be divided into two categories: lipid theories and protein theories. Lipid theory postulates that inhalational anesthetics exert their primary effects by dissolving in the lipid portions of nerves, altering the conductivity. In protein theories, the direct interaction of inhalation anesthetics and proteins has been proposed as the cause of anesthesia. All inhalation anesthetics agents introduced after 1950, except ethyl vinyl ether, contain fluorine. Agents such as ether, chloroform, trichloroethylene (Trilene), cyclopropane, and fluoroxene (Fluoromar), which were once used, have been displaced by the newer fluorinated anesthetics. The intravenous (iv) anesthetic agents are of two types: those which are used to induce, but not maintain, anesthesia, and those useful for induction and also maintenance. The need is for an anesthetic agent having an extremely fast rate of onset and limited side effects. Fast onset minimizes the stress and agitation. Among the various classes of compounds that have been used are barbiturates, opioids, steroids, benzodiazepines, and hindered phenols. Balanced anesthesia, a potent opioid combined with an inhalation agent, is often used. The inhalational agents probably exert their biological activity through physical effects, while function through a biological receptor‐mediated pathway. At the end of a surgery, the primary concern is to eliminate respiratory depressant effects. This reversal can also diminish analgesic effects. There are two types of reversal agents: pure antagonists and mixed agonist–antagonists. The antagonists naloxone and naltrexone are the most commonly used. Local anesthetics act by inhibiting the channel opening allowing influx of sodium ions. The degree of blockage depends not only on the amount of drug, but also on the rate of nerve stimulation. In the clinically useful agents the polar group is an ester or an amide, although activity may be maintained when the polar function is an ether, thioether, ketone, or thioester. The ideal agent should have a short onset of nesthesia and be useful for multiple indications.",

      "abstract": "In patients with consequences of a stroke, disturbances in motor, cognitive, and sensory functions are observed; cardiovascular, endocrine and other body systems, impairment of self-care and independent walking. Physical dependence, the inability to self-care in fulfilling urgent biological needs leads to a feeling of helplessness and is accompanied by depressive, neurotic reactions to the disease. Restoration of impaired functions after a stroke has a long period and the success of recovery depends, on the one hand, on the volume and location of the brain lesion, the severity of motor and cognitive impairments, on the other hand, on the position of the patient himself, the attitude of the patient’s personality to the disease and adherence to treatment. A patient’s stay in a hospital is associated with the social expectations of the staff for certain behavior of the patient: fulfilling the instructions of the attending physician, partnership with staff (physical therapy methodologist, speech therapist, occupational therapist, etc.), the patient’s activity, the formation of healthy lifestyle attitudes (giving up smoking, alcohol, fatty food, etc.), which can be called psychological conditions for rehabilitation. However, not all patients are ready to fulfill these rehabilitation conditions, which are targets for psychological correction. The tasks of psychological assistance should be focused on developing adherence to treatment, forming cooperative relationships with staff, and healthy lifestyle attitudes, which can contribute to restorative treatment and the prevention of recurrent stroke. Psychological assistance during individual and group work should be focused on providing emotional support, setting realistic and understandable goals for the patient, adequate to the patient’s capabilities, both in a hospital and clinic, which can ensure his active inclusion in the treatment process.",

Examples of ABIs include traumatic brain injury, stroke (ischaemic and haemorrhagic), infections (e.g. encephalitis, meningitis), hypoxia or oxygen starvation (often occurring following cardiac arrest) and enduring difficulties following the resection of brain tumours. Difficulties that emerge from these brain lesions are complex, multi-faceted and enduring. Psychological needs are central, including anxiety, depression, anger and irritability, post-traumatic stress and struggles to adjust to the condition (Williams and Evans 2003). These often occur alongside physical restrictions (reduced, mobility, balance, sensation), cognitive impairments (problems in information processing, attention, memory, planning and organising, visuospatial perception and social communication) and strain in interpersonal relationships, with progressive social isolation developing over time (Elsass and Kinsella 1987).",

      "title": "Primary visual cortex excitability is not atypical in acquired synaesthesia",
      "abstract": "•We report a case of acquired synaesthesia (LW) following 2C–B use.•We tested the prediction that LW would display primary visual cortex hyperexcitability.•TMS motor and phosphene thresholds were measured in LW and controls.•In contrast with our prediction, LW did not display an atypical phosphene threshold. Synaesthesia is a condition wherein stimulation of one modality automatically and consistently triggers activation of a secondary concurrent experience in a separate modality [[1]Ward J. Synesthesia.Annu Rev Psychol. 2013; 64: 49-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar]. Although it is typically viewed as a healthy neurodevelopmental condition with idiosyncratic inducer-concurrent associations that manifest in childhood, recent evidence suggests that synaesthesia-like experiences can be temporarily induced via consumption of recreational drugs, particularly serotonin receptor agonists (e.g., LSD, psilocybin) [[2]Luke D. Terhune D.B. The induction of synaesthesia with chemical agents: a systematic review.Front Psychol. 2013; 4Crossref Google Scholar]. Nevertheless, whether such experiences constitute a genuine form of synaesthesia remains controversial since drug-induced synaesthesias do not meet behavioural diagnostic criteria for developmental synaesthesia [[3]Yanakieva S. Luke P.D. Jansari A. Terhune D.B. Acquired synaesthesia following 2C-B use.Psychopharmacology. 2019; 236: 2287-2289Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar]. One interpretation of these phenomenological-behavioural discrepancies is that drug-induced synaesthesias do not meet such criteria because inducer-concurrent associations must undergo a process of consolidation before they achieve the level of automaticity and consistency characteristic of developmental synaesthesia [[4]Terhune D.B. Luke D.P. Kaelen M. Bolstridge M. Feilding A. Nutt D. et al.A placebo-controlled investigation of synaesthesia-like experiences under LSD.Neuropsychologia. 2016; 88: 28-34Crossref PubMed Scopus (26) Google Scholar]. We recently reported evidence in support of this hypothesis with a case of acquired synaesthesia (LW) following use of the recreational partial serotonin receptor agonist 2,5-dimethoxy-4-bromophenethylamine (2C–B; [[3]Yanakieva S. Luke P.D. Jansari A. Terhune D.B. Acquired synaesthesia following 2C-B use.Psychopharmacology. 2019; 236: 2287-2289Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar]). LW has reported multiple forms of synaesthesia for over 9 years since ingesting 70–150mg of 2C–B, which is approximately 3–12 times the normal dosage [[5]Johnson M.P. Mathis C.A. Shulgin A.T. Hoffman A.J. Nichols D.E. [125I]-2-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)aminoethane ([125I]-2C-I) as a label for the 5-HT2 receptor in rat frontal cortex.Pharmacol Biochem Behav. 1990; 35: 211-217Crossref PubMed Scopus (54) Google Scholar]. Using standardized measures, we corroborated that one or more of LW's multiple forms of synaesthesia exhibited either consistency or automaticity, thereby meeting diagnostic criteria for this condition [[1]Ward J. Synesthesia.Annu Rev Psychol. 2013; 64: 49-75Crossref PubMed Scopus (137) Google Scholar]. Despite these results, it remains unclear whether acquired synaesthesia shares overlapping neural mechanisms with developmental synaesthesia. It was recently proposed that drug-induced synaesthesia results from serotonin cascades triggering elevated cortical excitability in layer V pyramidal neurons, resulting in anomalous perceptual states that are mapped onto inducers, yielding synaesthetic experiences [[6]Brogaard B. Serotonergic hyperactivity as a potential factor in developmental, Acquired and drug-induced synesthesia.Front Hum Neurosci. 2013; 7Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar]. This hypothesis is consistent with research showing selective hyperexcitability in primary visual cortex, as measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) phosphene thresholds, but not motor (control) thresholds, in developmental synaesthesia [[7]Terhune D.B. Murray E. Near J. Stagg C.J. Cowey A. Cohen Kadosh R. Phosphene perception relates to visual cortex glutamate levels and covaries with atypical visuospatial awareness.Cerebr Cortex. 2015; 25: 4341-4350Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar] and after synaesthesia training in controls [[8]Rothen N. Schwartzman D.J. Bor D. Seth A.K. Coordinated neural, behavioral, and phenomenological changes in perceptual plasticity through overtraining of synesthetic associations.Neuropsychologia. 2018; 111: 151-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar]. If cortical hyperexcitability plays a role in induced synaesthesias, individuals with acquired synaesthesia will display selectively lower phosphene thresholds similar to developmental synaesthetes. The present study sought to test this prediction in LW using a double-blind design and standardized TMS protocols. LW (31 years old, male) and 29 non-synaesthete controls (17 females, 12 males, MAge = 25.32, SD = 4.45) provided informed written consent to participate in this study in accordance with local ethical approval. LW did not significantly differ in age from controls, t = 1.25, p = .11, Zcc = 1.28 [0.83, 1.57] with a probability of occurrence in the general population of pgp = 11% [7, 21]. None of the participants displayed contraindications for non-invasive brain stimulation and there were no adverse events. Phosphene and motor threshold estimation followed established TMS protocols [[9]Abrahamyan A. Clifford C.W.G. Ruzzoli M. Phillips D. Arabzadeh E. Harris J.A. Accurate and rapid estimation of phosphene thresholds (REPT).PLoS One. 2011; 6Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar,[10]Badran B.W. DeVries W.H. Glusman C.E. Willis A. Pridmore S. et al.Are EMG and visual observation comparable in determining resting motor threshold? A reexamination after twenty years.Brain Stimulation. 2019; 12: 364-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7) Google Scholar] (see Supplementary Materials). After identification of suitable stimulation sites, single-pulse TMS was applied to left primary motor cortex (motor thresholds) and midline primary visual cortex (phosphene thresholds) in counterbalanced order. For motor threshold estimation, participants rested their right hand on a table, with their forefinger and thumb touching and attended to the interosseous muscle. After stimulation to primary motor cortex with the coil positioned at a 45° postero-lateral angle, they reported whether they observed a visible twitch of the interosseous muscle during the stimulation. For phosphene threshold estimation, participants were first dark-adjusted and then sat with their eyes open at a 1 m distance from a large, non-reflective black curtain (3 × 3 m). After each stimulation with the TMS handle and coil in the vertical position, participants reported whether they had experienced a phosphene. Stimulation intensity varied on a trial-by-trial basis according to individual participants' reports, as determined by a Bayesian adaptive staircase procedure with 30 trials run on each site in order to estimate 60% thresholds for both motor and phosphene thresholds [[9]Abrahamyan A. Clifford C.W.G. Ruzzoli M. Phillips D. Arabzadeh E. Harris J.A. Accurate and rapid estimation of phosphene thresholds (REPT).PLoS One. 2011; 6Crossref PubMed Scopus (25) Google Scholar]. As can be seen in Fig. 1, in contrast to our central prediction, LW did not display a significantly lower TMS phosphene threshold (61) than controls, M = 63.38, SD = 9.49, t = 0.25, p = .60, Zcc = 0.25 [0.13, 0.58], with a probability of occurrence in the general population of pgp = 60% [45, 72]. LW displayed a marginally higher motor threshold, 72 (corresponding to the highest threshold in controls), than controls, M = 56.52, SD = 7.51, t = 2.03, p = .026, Zcc = 2.06 [1.70, 2.41], pgp = 3% [1, 5], and a marginally greater threshold difference (motor-phosphene), 11, relative to the controls, −6.86, SD = 10.28, t = 1.71, p = .049, Zcc = 1.74 [1.37, 2.09] with a probability of occurrence of 5% [2, 9]. We tested the prediction that a case of acquired synaesthesia would be characterized by selective hyperexcitability in primary visual cortex, as observed in developmental synaesthesia [[7]Terhune D.B. Murray E. Near J. Stagg C.J. Cowey A. Cohen Kadosh R. Phosphene perception relates to visual cortex glutamate levels and covaries with atypical visuospatial awareness.Cerebr Cortex. 2015; 25: 4341-4350Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar] and induced synaesthesia [[8]Rothen N. Schwartzman D.J. Bor D. Seth A.K. Coordinated neural, behavioral, and phenomenological changes in perceptual plasticity through overtraining of synesthetic associations.Neuropsychologia. 2018; 111: 151-162Crossref PubMed Scopus (11) Google Scholar]. In contrast with this prediction, we found that LW, an acquired synaesthete with previously-demonstrated inducer-concurrent automaticity and consistency [[3]Yanakieva S. Luke P.D. Jansari A. Terhune D.B. Acquired synaesthesia following 2C-B use.Psychopharmacology. 2019; 236: 2287-2289Crossref PubMed Scopus (4) Google Scholar], displayed typical TMS phosphene thresholds that were within 25% of a SD of the mean phosphene threshold in controls. We did observe a tendency for LW to display marginally greater motor thresholds than controls, but this effect was unpredicted and should be interpreted with caution. These results suggest that LW does not exhibit primary visual cortex hyperexcitability and are at odds with the broader hypothesis of a role for cortical excitability in drug-induced synaesthesia [[6]Brogaard B. Serotonergic hyperactivity as a potential factor in developmental, Acquired and drug-induced synesthesia.Front Hum Neurosci. 2013; 7Crossref PubMed Scopus (34) Google Scholar]. One interpretation of these results is that atypical cortical hyperexcitability will only be observed in acquired synaesthesia further downstream in visual cortex, such as V4.

      "title": "Restless legs syndrome--relevant aspects for internal medicine specialists.",
      "abstract": "Restless legs syndrome (RLS), also known as Ekbom's syndrome, is a fairly common complaint which is not widely recognised by medical professionals, although it seems to affect 1-10% of the population. Despite recent attempts to better characterize RLS, this neurologic disorder remains poorly understood. Idiopathic RLS frequently follows an autosomal dominant inheritance with a variable clinical expressivity of symptoms. Secondary RLS is usually associated with neuropathy of chronic disorders (uremia, cryoglobulinemia, diabetes mellitus, infections, etc). RLS gives the sufferer an unpleasant sensation in the legs at rest, causing an irresistible desire to move which alleviates the discomfort. Other features that characterize RLS include sleep disturbance, involuntary movements in sleep or wakefulness, a normal neurologic examination, a chronic clinical course (waxing and waning over the time), and, in some cases, a positive family history. Periodic limb movements during sleep, which also may occur as an isolated finding, may or may not cause frequent arousals or awakenings. Clinical diagnosis of idiopathic or symptomatic forms of RLS can be supported with polysomnography. Full understanding of the features of RLS will provide the clinician with the strongest tool for recognizing the disorder. Many different treatments have been tried for RLS. Since the cause is unclear, therapy of RLS and PLMS remains symptomatic except for some secondary forms. Treatment of first choice consists of dopaminergic drugs or dopamine agonist, opioids and benzodiazepines.",

      "title": "[Consciousness functions in psychoses. Concepts, empirism and hypotheses].",
      "abstract": "Schizophrenia may be described as a disease where speech, bodily language and social responsiveness are obvious expressions of a deteriorated ability to interact with the surroundings in a precise and relevant way. The lack of precision and relevance pertains to perception and recall as well as communication and action. The deficient potential for activation of the prefrontal cerebral cortex is a neurobiological correlate to the lesion of precise and relevant planning and expression. Impairment of formal thought and language in schizophrenia are suggested to result from a developmental disorder pertaining to language and concept formation (apperception). In reactive psychoses with dissociative disturbances of consciousness there is an inefficient capacity for adapting to external reality; thus relevant conscious planning and interaction with the outside world are impaired. Clinically a distractibility of a tematic nature ensues. Except for catastrophic events, psychotic reactions cannot be predicted from analysis of the actual experience--neither concerning the external nor the internal aspects of conscious awareness. Sometimes, however, previous events relating to the formation of the self may add explanatory value to the analysis of reactive psychosis. In some cases biological predisposition is the decisive determinant. The normal discrimination between sense-perception and imagination has a counterpart in the dichotomy of awareness of the outside world versus awareness of the self. The following are examples of psychotic experience where the normal ability for dichotomic discrimination may be damaged: Illusions of affect, hallucinations, Schneider's first rank symptoms, \"Anwesenheit\" and consciousness of time.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

      "title": "An Experimental Evidence of Etiology in Postural Vertigo",
      "abstract": "The symptoms and findings of postural vertigo vary, so the causation of this disturbing unpleasantness is obviously not always the same. The effect of minute changes of the gravitational force upon the otolith organs was suspected. Disturbances of circulation in the head and neck subsequent to postural changes were implicated. Abnormalities in the 'neck reflexes' was another consideration. Small, circumscribed lesions produced in the cerebellum created typical postural nystagmus in the experimental animal. More recently, an unexplained histologic change of otolith detachment was believed evoking the symptoms. The clinical entity, termed as the benign paroxysmal postural vertigo, was identified with most of the above-mentioned etiological factors. Observations made on the many hundreds or thousands of patients on the indeed benign and self-limiting nature of this condition tended to rule out circulatory, central nervous or otolithic etiologies. Instead, because certain neck movements appear to trigger the symptoms, the possibility of a neural rather than a vascular causative factor was examined in animal experimentation. It could be established that mechanical stimulation of the neural plexus, or the sympathetic cervical nerve, in the dog will excite the ipsilateral vestibular end organs with a short burst of impulses. The experimentally evoked reflex activity fatigues but it is reproducible. These observations are applicable in explaining the pathomechanism of the benign type paroxysmal postural vertigo. Postural vertigo of inner ear or CNS origin should be differentiated from similar, positioning symptoms where no specific cause was detectable. This idiopathic condition is a response of the neural, sympathetic plexus on the exposed surface of the vertebral artery. For better identification of this common disease, in contrast to benign paroxysmal postural vertigo (BPPV), positioning neurocervical vertigo (PNV) is suggested.",

      "title": "The Amygdala And Ventromedial Prefrontal Cortex: Functional Contributions And Dysfunction In Psychopathy",
      "abstract": "Abstract Psychopathy is a developmental disorder (Lynam et al., 2007) marked by emotional dysfunction (reduced guilt and empathy) and antisocial behaviour (Harpur et al., 1988; Hare, 1991; Frick, 1995). The disorder is not equivalent to the psychiatric diagnoses of Conduct Disorder (CD) or Antisocial Personality Disorder (ASPD) (DSM-IV) or Conduct Disorder and Dissocial Personality Disorder (ICD 10) (for full details on the assessment of psychopathy, see Patrick, 2006). These psychiatric diagnoses concentrate on the antisocial behaviour shown by the individual rather than any putative cause such as the emotion dysfunction seen in psychopathy. A distinctive feature of psychopathy is that it confers an increased risk of both reactive and instrumental aggression (Cornell et al., 1996; Frick et al., 2003). Reactive aggression is triggered by a frustrating or threatening event and involves unplanned, enraged attacks on the object perceived to be the source of the threat or frustration. This aggression type is often accompanied by anger and can be considered ‘hot’. Importantly, it is initiated without regard for any potential goal. This is in direct contrast with instrumental aggression, which is purposeful and goal directed (e.g., to obtain the victim’s possessions). Furthermore, instrumental aggression need not be accompanied by an emotional state, such as anger, and can be considered ‘cold’. Many emotional disorders (e.g., childhood bipolar disorder and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder) confer an increased risk of reactive aggression (Blair et al., 2005). However, psychopathy is the only psychiatric condition to also confer an increased risk of instrumental aggression.",

Its symptoms often interfere with work or school, interpersonal relationships, and with activities of daily living (e.g., driving, using the bathroom). Moreover, the psychopathology of OCD is seemingly complex: sufferers battle ubiquitous unwanted thoughts, doubts, and images that, while senseless on the one hand, are perceived as signs of danger on the other hand. The thematic variation and elaborate relations between behavioral and cognitive signs and symptoms can be perplexing to even the most experienced of observers. Cognitive-behavioral models of OCD explain these phenomena and account for their heterogeneity. These models also have implications for how OCD is treated using exposure and response prevention, which research indicates are effective short- and long-term interventions.",

      "abstract": "Neurodevelopmental disorders, affective/emotional disorders and exposure to adverse life circumstances are the main sources of psychological impairment in school age children. They should be distinguished from transient psychological symptoms occurring in normal development that do not significantly affect children's emotional and social functioning. An early recognition and assessment is the first step towards adequate treatment of conditions associated with psychological impairment. Any severe or persistant behavioral or emotional symptom occurring in children should be considered a possible early sign of a neurodevelopmental disorder warranting further investigation. Neurodevelopmental disorders are generally associated with delays early in development affecting several domains (language, social functioning, emotional and behavorial regulation) and are predominant in boys. These disorders are highly comorbid and require multidisciplinary assessments and treatment plans. Emotional and behavioral conditions arising from early deprivation or maltreatment also affect various developmental domains and may have lasting consequences. Finally, many of the disorders showing rising prevalences in adolescence or early adulthood also have some developmental precursors before puberty. Progress in identification, appropriate assessment and treatment of early manifesting symptoms and conditions interfering with adaptive functioning is a major mental health issue requiring multidisciplinary competencies.",

Case reports and case series are the majority of the scientific literature on TTM in childhood and the true prevalence is not known; however it is well known that TTM frequently occurs in younger childhood. In the literature, it is reported that trichotillomania can be a manifestation of conflicting situations such as disturbed mother-child relationship, inadequate communication with family members or constant stress in school, sibling rivalry, raised inner psychic aggression against parents, overindulgence by parents, or inadequate emotional satisfaction. Studies show that symptoms of depression and anxiety may be pervasive among youth with TTM and likely impact functional impairment. The aim of this article is to present two very early onset trichotillomania cases which are thought to be associated with anxiety and family stress, especially with maternal stress and impaired affective interpersonal communication between mother and child.",

Although self injurious behavior is religiously and culturally sanctioned in some communities, it can be observed together with psychiatric disorders such as borderline personality disorder, histrionic personality disorder, psychotic personality disorder and mood disorders. Research shows that the onset of self-injurious behavior is between the ages 13-19. Self-injurious behavior is classified as direct self-injury and indirect self-injury. Cigarette, alcohol and substance use, over eating; not taking ones medication although an illness is diagnosed are indirect self-injurious behaviors. Direct self-injurious behavior is categorized into four groups: typical, psychotic, compulsive and impulsive self-injurious behavior. Research that investigated the reasons of self-injurious behavior showed that physical abuse had a significant effect. People who had been physically abused were injuring themselves to handle the intense feelings and to punish themselves. It is reported that 90% of self-injuriers were using drugs and the majority of these people were addicted. (Anatolian Journal of Psychiatry 2003; 4:226-236)",

      "title": "Child trauma",
      "abstract": "Abstract This chapter will focus on the impact on children of traumatic events other than child abuse or neglect, which are covered in Chapter 9.3.3. According to the DSM-IV-TR definition of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), traumatic events involve exposure to actual or threatened death or injury, or a threat to physical integrity. The child's response generally involves an intense reaction of fear, horror, or helplessness which may be exhibited through disorganized or agitated behaviour. Terr suggested separating traumatic events into type I traumas which are single sudden events and type II traumas which are long-standing or repeated events. If the traumatic event includes bereavement, the reactions may be complicated and readers should consult Chapter 9.3.7 to address the bereavement aspects of the event. Following a traumatic event, children may react in a variety of ways (see Chapters 4.6.1 and 4.6.2 for the adult perspective on reactions to stressful and traumatic events). Many show some of the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder—re-experiencing the event (e.g. through nightmares, flashbacks, intrusive thoughts, re-enactment, or repetitive play of the event), avoidance and numbing (e.g. avoidance of conversations, thoughts, people, places, and activities associated with the traumatic event, inability to remember a part of the event, withdrawal from previously enjoyed activities, feeling different from others, restriction of emotions, sense of foreshortened future), and physiological arousal (e.g. sleep disturbance, irritability, concentration problems, being excessively alert to further danger, and being more jumpy). In young children the nightmares may become general nightmares rather than trauma-specific. Other reactions to trauma in children are: ♦ becoming tearful and upset or depressed ♦ becoming clingy to carers or having separation anxiety ♦ becoming quiet and withdrawn ♦ becoming aggressive ♦ feeling guilty ♦ acquiring low self-esteem ♦ deliberately self-harming ♦ acquiring eating problems ♦ feeling as if they knew it was going to happen ♦ developing sleep disturbances such as night-terrors or sleepwalking ♦ dissociating or appearing ‘spaced out’ ♦ losing previously acquired developmental abilities or regression ♦ developing physical symptoms such as stomach aches and headaches ♦ acquiring difficulties remembering new information ♦ developing attachment problems ♦ acquiring new fears ♦ developing problems with alcohol or drugs. Such problems may individually or in combination cause substantial difficulties at school and at home. The reactions of some children will diminish over time; however, for some they will persist, causing distress or impairment, warranting diagnosis, and/or intervention. Research predicting which children will be more likely to be distressed following a traumatic event suffers from a number of methodological flaws. However, factors which are often identified as constituting a risk for developing PTSD across a number of studies include: level of exposure, perceived level of threat and peri-traumatic fear, previous psychological problems, family difficulties, co-morbid diagnoses, subsequent life events, and lack of social support.",

      "title": "PSYCHIATRIC PROBLEMS OF THE GERMAN OCCUPATION",
      "abstract": "A description of patients seen in an Army psychiatric clinic in Germany can give only a general idea of the personality problems encountered. A great many patients with fundamentally psychiatric problems are treated in other clinics. Perhaps even more important in regard to the dependent and War Department civilian population is that the majority of individuals with neurotic tendencies fostered by occupation life probably do not seek medical attention at all. The somewhat artificial pattern of occupation life encourages the development of latent neurotic potentialities. The diminished force of such restrictive and inhibiting factors as home and church influences, social pressures exerted by other community groups, and the precariously balanced moral and ethical feelings imbued during early life is not compensated for by the rather rigid, paternalistic, impersonal, often frustrating framework of Army organization. This, and the lack of accustomed recreational and intellectual outlets, often stimulate the development of behavior such as heavy drinking or sexual promiscuity. Such behavior, although basically maladaptive, serves its function in the given situation. Another factor is the continual frustration with regard to normally minor aspects of daily life, such as transportation, and the obtaining of commodities and services through legal Army channels, as neither of these are legally obtainable to any degree from the German economy. In addition, the constant, though often unnoticed, underlying tension incident to living in a hostile country, surrounded by the most desolate ruins, may give rise to a sense of imprisonment, poorly controlled irritability, or other symptoms not sufficient to warrant a clinic visit. The innate hostility of Americans to anyone \"foreign\" is a complicating factor contributing to the relative social insularity of the Americans and the lack of opportunity for social interplay of a normal variety between the average American and Germans of corresponding class. The distinction between conqueror and conquered is a sharp one, emphasized not only by obvious differences in nutritional state, clothing, shelter, and transportation, but also by the frequent signs forbidding German use of certain facilities. The social distance between the two groups is such that, except for a minority, contact with the native population is usually at the level of the \"putzfrau,\" and the \"fraulein,\" and the blackmarketeer. The American leaving the Occupied Zone often feels that he knows little more about the psychology of the Germans than he did shortly after his arrival. Certain efforts have been made to stabilize American community life. In place of an enforced bachelorhood of several months, during which the husband is alone in Germany, the Army is transporting married couples overseas together. The commodity-dispensing system is being operated more efficiently. Rail transport is improving, and there is an increasing number of private vehicles. Dependents are becoming more active in such civic-minded affairs as the German Youth Activity, and the Army is attempting to encourage educational pursuits among troops. A strenuous effort is also being made to curb the blackmarket. However, these things have not as yet materially affected the interpersonal exchange between members of the various groups in the Zone, or the basic tensions and conflict-breeding situations that are present. It is to be expected, therefore, that psychiatric problems associated with the social and psychological environment of Occupied Germany will continue to be seen in occupational personnel.",

      "abstract": "A drug can be defined as a substance other than food which may affect the constitution or function of a living thing through its chemical properties. In this sense, it may be possible to place organic solvents like bond, gas or thinner and narcotics like marijuana, methamphetamine, cocaine or heroine under the category of drugs. These drugs are characteristic of having positive medicinal as well as side effects upon human being including but not limited to excitement, hallucinatory image, auditory hallucination, relaxation, sleeping, anorexia, nerve stability, schizophrenia, anaesthesia, brain damage, narcissism, etc. Abuse of drugs, however, would result in direct and indirect impact upon the society, family and industry as a whole by ruining of families, unemployment, loss of manpower, and catastrophic damage of physical and mental health of all people. Strong cling to drugs could also cause devastation of personality by abandoning relationship with family members and friends and even jobs, hobbies and culture and would eventually make addicts unsociable. Furthermore, abuse of drugs could be a cause for more serious phenomenon of social pathology such as drastic increase of inhuman violent crimes, crimes without specific motives, frequent burglary and theft to raise the money to buy drugs with. In contrast with the global trend to enforce the regulations for drug-related crimes, the Korean judiciary authorities keep on dealing leniently with offenders, especially when they are first timers, by only charging the fine not exceeding 50 million Won. To put use of drugs under control, it seems more effective to install and operate facilities which are dedicated to providing supports for drug addicts to get free from the cycle of crimes and return to the society. In sum, it would be extremely important to study the measures needed to prevent occurrence of drug-related crimes because the issue of addiction can not　rely on legal punishments alone. The legal system that imposes heavy penalty upon drug-related crimes may be effective to a certain extent in terms of crime prevention but has limit in itself. It is therefore most imperative to respond in a more active way to prevention of drug-related crimes by introducing the educational programs for drug addiction, by training experts who can treat drug addicts, not to speak of working out preventive measures from the perspective of criminal legislation and socio-cultural aspects as well.",

      "title": "Problems with Object Permanence: Rethinking Traditional Beliefs Associated with Poor Theory of Mind in Autism",
      "abstract": "Poor Theory of Mind (ToM) (or difficulties imputing mental states to self and others) [1], (See also [2-5]) is often blamed for certain responses and behaviour in autism. However, the Theory of Mind Task Battery requires an understanding of language, the use of cognitive skills, as well as the child’s motivation and attention to complete. All of these factors are either weak or under-developed in individuals with autism suggesting that this is not the best means to measure one’s understanding that other people have their own thoughts, plans, beliefs, or point of view. Behaviours like strong defiance, insistence on sameness, fear associated with sudden change and severe anxiety may be related to difficulties seeing beyond the ‘now’ [6]. This paper suggests that some of the stress and anxiety in the autism population may actually be due to delayed object permanence (OP) (knowing something may still exist even if it is out of sight), which can appear as poor ToM. This delay in establishing OP is governed by single focused attention. For more information on this concept see: Lawson, W. (2011) The passionate mind, JKP:London. Although ToM and OP are defined differently, this paper aims to show the relationship between them and how one concept can influence the other using examples in everyday life to illustrate how poor OP is associated with single focused attention, which detracts from the bigger picture.",

      "title": "Vomiting",
      "abstract": "Vomiting is a generally unpleasant activity that results in the expulsion of stomach contents through the mouth. It is a physical act that has clearly associated gastrointestinal motor activity. Nausea, on the other hand, although frequently accompanying vomiting, is not universally associated with it and does not have an obvious physical mechanism. It is an uncomfortable feeling known to be relieved by vomiting.The ability to vomit presumably conveys a survival advantage by enabling the expulsion of toxins from the stomach. Vomiting occurs after stimulation of either the vomiting center (VC), a central “control center” in the medulla near the respiratory center, or the chemoreceptor trigger zone (CTZ) in the area postrema on the floor of the fourth ventricle (Fig. 1). These coordination centers can be stimulated through multiple pathways. Vomiting resulting from psychological stress occurs via pathways traveling through the cerebral cortex and limbic system to the VC. Anticipatory vomiting may be mediated through this mechanism. Vomiting related to motion occurs when the VC is stimulated through the vestibular or vestibulocerebellar system from the labyrinth of the inner ear. Chemical signals from the bloodstream and cerebrospinal fluid are detected by the CTZ. This mechanism has been the target of many antiemetic medications. The vagal and visceral nerves are the fourth pathway for stimulation of vomiting via gastrointestinal irritation, distention, and delayed gastric emptying.Once the vomiting centers are stimulated, the cascade of motor events leading to the act of vomiting is the same. Nonperistaltic contractions in the small intestine increase,the gallbladder contracts, and some of the duodenal contents regurgitate into the stomach. This is followed by a large retrograde peristaltic wave that pushes small bowel contents and pancreatobiliary secretions into the stomach and suppresses gastric activity. Meanwhile,the inspiratory muscles contract against a closed glottis, resulting in esophageal dilatation. As the abdominal muscles contract,the stomach contents are forced into the distal esophagus. Relaxation of the abdominal muscles allows the esophageal contents to re-enter the stomach. The cycles of retching quicken until the esophagus no longer empties between cycles, and the contents finally are extruded. The gastrointestinal motor events of vomiting are mediated through vagal and sympathetic efferents from the VC, as are the autonomic events associated with the act of vomiting, namely, increased salivation, increased respiratory and heart rates, and pupillary dilatation.True vomiting can be divided into two broad categories:nonbilious and bilious. Bilious vomiting occurs when bile is purged along with the gastric contents. Although some small intestinal reflux into the stomach is common with all vomiting, in nonbilious vomiting, antegrade intestinal flow is preserved, and the majority of the bile drains into the more distal portions of the intestine. If an obstruction is present,nonbilious vomiting implies that the obstruction is proximal to the ampulla of Vater. Conditions leading to bilious vomiting involve either a disorder of motility or physical blockage to this antegrade flow of proximal intestinal contents distal to the ligament of Treitz.Gastroesophageal reflux (GER), although not true vomiting, frequently is included in discussions of vomiting. In contrast to the mechanism of true vomiting discussed previously, GER occurs as a result of failed normal esophageal function. Normally, the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) relaxes with swallowing and propagation of esophageal peristalsis, allowing a food bolus to enter the stomach. Its basal contraction prevents food from re-entering the esophagus from the stomach. Transient relaxation of the LES predisposes to GER and is the major mechanism in infants who have GER. The LES is aided by surrounding structures, especially the crural diaphragm, and disruption of these structures, as with a hiatal hernia, contributes to the GER in some patients. Nicotine, alcohol, caffeine, and some medications can increase relaxation of the LES, contributing to GER in some individuals. GER also is distinguished from true vomiting by its symptoms; the emesis of GER is effortless and generally not associated with retching or autonomic symptoms.Although the causes of vomiting in children are many, a thorough history of the nature of the vomiting and any associated signs or symptoms as well as a complete physical examination generally helps narrow the differential diagnosis (Table 1). Targeted studies help identify the cause of the illness.Acute gastroenteritis is the most common cause of vomiting in children. It is usually associated with diarrhea and abdominal pain, and viruses are common etiologic agents, although bacterial pathogens also must be considered. The most common viral agent in infants is rotavirus. Bacterial pathogens include Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, and Escherichia coli. Bacterial infections are associated more commonly with bloody diarrhea and high fevers than are viral infections. Enterohemorrhagic E coli 0157:H7 can cause hemorrhagic colitis and may be complicated by the development of hemolytic-uremic syndrome. Clostridium difficile is a bacterial pathogen that frequently is associated with the recent use of antibiotics. It causes a pseudo-membranous colitis, often with bloody diarrhea and associated with abdominal pain and vomiting. Giardia lamblia is a protozoan commonly associated with contaminated water and attendance at child care centers. It may cause watery diarrhea and vomiting.Diagnosis is made with stool bacterial cultures, rotazyme analysis for rotavirus, detection of C difficile toxin, and detection of ova and parasites for G lamblia. Sepsis,central nervous system infections, urinary tract infections, and pneumonia all can present with or involve vomiting, usually in addition to other symptoms.Labyrinthitis and pancreatitis both cause vomiting. Dizziness usually is associated with labyrinthitis and abdominal pain with pancreatitis.Inflammatory conditions of the intestinal tract, such as inflammatory bowel disease, also tend to involve vomiting. In these conditions, the vomiting frequently is related to altered motility with abnormal or dysfunctional swallowing, gastric emptying, or peristalsis.Both inborn errors of metabolism and endocrinologic disorders can cause vomiting (Table 2). The inborn errors of metabolism generally present in early infancy, and the vomiting is associated with symptoms of lethargy, hypo- or hypertonia, seizures, or coma. The constellation of symptoms is similar to that seen in sepsis, necessitating a high index of suspicion in the evaluation of these patients. The presence or absence of metabolic acidosis, hypoglycemia, hyperammonemia, or ketosis and a family history that includes possible consanguinity can help to determine the diagnosis.One endocrinologic condition associated with vomiting is diabetes mellitus. Vomiting can complicate acute ketoacidosis or occur in patients who have had long-standing diabetes and consequent gastroparesis. Slowed gastric motility usually presents after diabetes mellitus has been present for approximately 10 years. Early satiety and a sense of fullness frequently precede the onset of vomiting in diabetic gastroparesis.Vomiting as a consequence of food-related sensitivity always should be considered. The variants encountered most commonly in pediatric patients are cow milk and soy protein intolerance,type I (IgE-mediated) food allergy, and celiac disease. Cow milk protein intolerance affects 2% to 7% of infants, with approximately 20% of these also sensitive to soy protein. In addition to vomiting, the patients usually have diarrhea that frequently is guaiac-positive. Celiac disease occurs only in children who eat gluten-containing foods. Patients typically suffer from wasting, irritability, and diarrhea, but vomiting also can occur.Vomiting occurs in any neurologic condition that involves increased intracranial pressure (ICP) (Table 3). Additionally, patients who have seizures, autonomic disorders (Riley-Day syndrome), and conditions affecting the floor of the fourth ventricle without increased ICP frequently have their condition worsened with vomiting.Cyclic vomiting is a unique entity that must be considered separately. Onset occurs typically at early school age, and it is characterized by acute-onset periodic episodes of nausea and vomiting interspersed with conspicuous periods of wellness.Approximately 77% of patients can identify precipitating events,usually intense emotional states. These patients have an increased incidence of migraine headaches and prevalence of epilepsy and irritable bowel syndrome. Because no diagnostic test or specific clinical identifying feature distinguishes cyclic vomiting syndrome from other potentially life-threatening conditions, the diagnosis can be made only after time has elapsed and upon exclusion of other diagnoses.Behavioral or psychological causes of vomiting can be problematic in the pediatric age group. Some children induce vomiting to seek attention in environments in which personal attention is lacking. The extreme of this behavior is rumination. Rumination is a serious condition that occurs in infants when there is a failure in reciprocal interaction between the infant and caregiver. The purposes of rumination are self-stimulation and satisfaction of needs. Rumination also is seen in older children, especially those who are severely mentally retarded.Classically, the infant (older than 3 months) learns to bring up gastric contents into the mouth, frequently by inserting a hand into the back of the throat or simply through rhythmic contractions of the pharynx, tongue, and abdominal muscles. The oral contents then are reswallowed, although spillage does occur. Not only do these patients suffer social deprivation, but the chronic emesis can lead to inanition and growth failure. The failure to thrive does not improve with traditional medical intervention, but rather requires sensitive and interactive nurturing. A mother-substitute who is empathic with and observant of both the parent’s and infant’s needs is required to help the parent establish more nurturing skills. More formal psychotherapeutic help frequently is needed for the parents.Bulimia, characterized by secretive binge-eating episodes followed by self-induced vomiting, is a cause of vomiting especially among teenagers.The anatomic and, thus, the generally surgical causes of nonbilious vomiting are those that affect the intestinal tract proximal to the point of bilious drainage (ampulla of Vater), which is proximal to the ligament of Treitz (Table 4). Whereas congenital anomalies usually present in the newborn period, acquired lesions can present at any age. Any infant who exhibits persistent nonbilious vomiting, with or without feeding, in the immediate newborn period must be suspected of having an intestinal atresia or a luminally obstructing lesion(pyloric stenosis, luminal band, web) proximal to the point of bile drainage(ampulla of Vater).An easy and rapid test to evaluate possible esophageal atresia is the ability to pass a nasogastric tube easily into the stomach. After the tube has been passed, it is important to obtain a radiograph to assure that the tube is in the stomach and not coiled in an atretic esophagus. Any resistance to passage of the tube is an indication for evaluation by contrast radiograph for an obstruction. If an obstruction is present, nasoesophageal tube drainage is important to prevent aspiration of pooled esophageal secretions. Contrast studies are the standard for the diagnosis of these conditions (Figs 2–4Figure 2Figure 3– Figure 4AFigure 4B). Although not absolute, anatomic conditions causing luminal obstruction distal to the ligament of Treitz usually cause bilious vomiting. Bilious vomiting is an ominous sign that mandates immediate evaluation(Table 5). In the newborn period, intestinal atresias and stenosis and malrotation with or without volvulus need to be ruled out immediately. In the older child, malrotation with volvulus also is a surgical emergency that is diagnosed relatively easily by gastrointestinal contrast study. After the diagnosis has been established radiographically, the gastrointestinal tract should be decompressed with a nasogastric tube, food and drink withheld,and the patient supported with intravenous fluids until definitive surgical intervention can be undertaken.Bright red blood in emesis implies active bleeding in the esophagus, stomach, or proximal duodenum. Coffee-ground color (darker oxidized blood), on the other hand, implies a recent history of bleeding. Fortunately, gastrointestinal bleeding is relatively rare in children. Children who experience massive gastrointestinal bleeding frequently have predisposing conditions, such as esophageal varices from chronic liver disease (Table 6). When such bleeding is encountered, initial therapy always is stabilization and resuscitation of the patient. Minimal bleeding that does not result in any change in hemodynamics or hematocrit frequently can be treated with histamine-2 blockers or antacids. Larger hemorrhages, however, require further intervention. The rate and volume of bleeding should be measured early, and if significant, a nasogastric tube left in place for continuous monitoring and removal of the gastric blood. After stabilization, the patient should be transported to a facility where there are endoscopists and surgeons skilled in pediatric care and management of gastrointestinal bleeding.",

Anxiety is manifest by the mood of fearfulness, behaviour marked by restlessness and avoidance of situations, increased arousal with insomnia, excessive preoccupation with thoughts on the theme of insecurity, and a wide range of somatic symptoms which are based on muscular tension, hyperventilation leading to paraesthesiae and faintness, and symptoms based on overactivity of the autonomic nervous system. Excessive anxiety and situational avoidance leads to diminution of performance and limitation of endeavour.

Central monoaminergic (noradrenergic, dopaminergic, serotonergic) neural networks, limbic structures, the sympathoadrenal system, the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis, and the immune system are considered the most important stress pathways. Their activation determines stress reactivity and pathological consequences on exposure to situations of distress. Both trauma and long-term stress can cause alterations in the activities of neuroanatomical structures and neural networks within the central nervous system. These neurohormonal changes are associated with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a disturbance thought to be one of the most serious psychiatric illnesses. PTSD may develop in individuals after exposure to a traumatic event (war, violence, accident) and is manifested by various symptoms, such as re-experiencing, flashbacks, intrusive thoughts, impaired memory of the event, sleep disorders, nightmares, panic attacks, and depression. In this review the neurohormonal changes associated with experiencing stress are presented to highlight the molecular and hormonal basis of PTSD.",

Case : A 17-year-old male with headache since 3 months ago, 3 days after suffered a blow to his left head from falling from a chair. At that time, the patient fainted for about 15 minutes but had no complaints after regained consciousness. Pain is felt on the left side of the head, throbbing, mild-moderate intensity, and feels heavier with a loud sound or a too-bright light. Discussion: Post-traumatic headache is clinically diagnosed. Laboratory and routine diagnostic imaging studies are unnecessary and have minimal clinical utility. Conclusion: Chronic post-traumatic headaches often occur, especially after minimally traumatic brain injury. The clinical picture is variable and may be similar to tension-type headaches and/or migraines. Pendahuluan: Nyeri kepala dalam tujuh hari setelah cedera kepala atau setelah sadar kembali dari trauma kepala disebut nyeri kepala pasca-trauma (post-traumatic headache/PTHA); disebut sakit kepala pasca-trauma kronis atau kronis (CPTHA) jika berlangsung lebih dari tiga bulan setelah cedera. Kasus: Seorang laki-laki berusia 17 tahun dengan keluhan nyeri kepala sejak 3 bulan, 3 hari setelah kepala kiri terbentur karena jatuh dari kursi. Saat itu, pasien pingsan sekitar 15 menit, tidak ada keluhan setelah sadar. Nyeri dirasakan di sisi kiri kepala, berdenyut, intensitas ringan-sedang, terasa lebih berat jika ada suara keras atau cahaya terlalu terang. Diskusi: Nyeri kepala pasca-trauma didiagnosis secara klinis. Laboratorium dan studi pencitraan diagnostik rutin tidak diperlukan dan memiliki utilitas klinis minimal. Simpulan: Nyeri kepala pasca-trauma kronis sering terjadi, terutama setelah cedera otak traumatis minimal. Gambaran klinisnya bervariasi dan dapat mirip nyeri kepala tipe tegang dan/atau migrain",

If another physician, or the patient, adds a medication or supplement that causes an interaction with the patient's current psychotropic prescription, the result might be increased metabolism or clearance of the psychotropic--thus decreasing its efficacy and leading to a new mood episode. [P]hysical health changes. Neurologic conditions (epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, stroke), autoimmune illnesses (eg, lupus), primary sleep disorders (eg, obstructive sleep apnea), and hormone changes (eg, testosterone, estrogen, and thyroid) that can occur over the lifespan of a patient with a mood disorder can trigger a new episode.

Chronic use of alcohol and opiates and withdrawal from cocaine and stimulants in a patient with a mood disorder can induce a depressive episode; use of cocaine, stimulants, and caffeine can induce a manic state.

Analysing such questions is indispensable during criminal actions where the responsibility and culpability of the offender is to be considered. The examination of the offender's mental state may help to recognise undiagnosed neuro-psychiatric conditions. The case of a man, suspected to have violently murdered his spouse is reported. During his criminal act he was probably in a pathological mental state caused by alcoholic drunkenness and decreased emotional control; besides he may have ictal or interictal disturbance of consciousness. The alcoholic state does not limit culpability, while epileptic disturbance of consciousness may exempt the offender.",

SW, CA and ST are different clinical manifestations of the same disorder being ST the most severe and SW the mildest manifestation. Disorders of arousal are typical parasomnias of NREM sleep, mainly slow wave sleep. Pathophysiological mechanism of these disorders is the state's dissociation of wakefulness and sleep. The conjunction of the constitutional factors (genetic, age, sleep privation, drugs, psychological, etc.), and precipitant factors (light, sound, temperature, touch, apnea, gastroesophageal reflux, seizure, fever, psychological, etc.) permit three possible arousal behavioral response: A full awakening, a shift stage of sleep or a partial arousal. Clinical significance of arousal parasomnias depend on the age. In children are caused by developmental and genetic factors and usually are autolimited. In adults usually are caused by psychopathology. In the elderly are often caused by organic brain syndromes. Parasomnias of sleep-wake transition are: Rhythmic movements of sleep, sleeptalking, starts and the nocturnal cramp. Most of them are mild disorders, almost physiological phenomena that usually don't need any treatment.",

      "abstract": "Neuropathic pain arises from a lesion in the somatosensory system, which includes peripheral nerves, spinal dorsal horn, ascending projection tracts, thalamus, the somatosensory cortex and other painprocessing brain region. Patients with neuropathic pain have neurosensory defecits as a consequence of their direct neural injury with positivesensory phenomena (i.e., hyperalgesia, allodyneia, dysthesia and paresthesia). Paresthesia is a variety of neuropathic pain arises as a spontaneous and abnormal sensation. The problem may arise from an abnormality anywhere along the sensory pathway from the peripheral nerves to the sensory cortex. Paresthesia are often described as pins-and-needle sensation. Particular kinds of paresthesias can be seen in the central nervous system (CNS) as follows: focal sensory seizures with cortical lesions, spontaneous pain in the thalamic syndrome, or bursts of paresthesia down the back or into the arms upon flexing the neck (Lhermitte’s sign) in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) or other disorders of the cervical spinal cord. Level lesions of the spinal cord may cause either a band sensation or a girdle sensation, a vague sense of awareness of altered sensation encircling the abdomen. Nerve root lesions or isolated peripheral nerve lesions may also cause paresthesia, but the most intense and annoying paresthesia is due to a multiple symmetric peripheral neuropathy (polyneuropathy). Dysesthesia or allodynia is the term for abnormal sensations ordinarily evoked by a nonnoxious stimuli. Paresthesias may be transient (following a prolonged crossing of patients leg) and not associated with neurological abnormality; however, if paresthesias are persistent, sensory system abnormality should be ruled out. In recent years, there has been expanded insight in to the pathophysiology of neuropathic pain because of their multiple and complex pathophysiological mechanisms. Convincing evidence on the relationship between the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and neuropathic pain symptoms now suggests that classifying neuropathic pain according to a mechanism-based rather than an etiology-based approach. So we will try to explain the mechanism of paresthesia in this chapter.",

Free-floating neurotic anxiety constitutes anxiety neurosis that is divided into panic disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. Panic attacks are characteristic of panic disorder and may give rise to a sequential development of anticipatory anxiety, agoraphobia, secondary depression, and abuse of alcohol and anxiolytic drugs.

Anxiety-like symptoms are a frequent response to trauma (physical or psychological) and can be features of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), acute stress disorder, or adjustment disorder.Validated tools are available to screen for mental health symptoms generally, anxiety symptoms specifically, posttraumatic stress specifically, and impaired functioning, and to assess the effect of the child’s problem on caregivers; results lead to further discussions with the child and family.A child who feels anxious often has a parent who feels anxious or depressed; care of the parent is integral to helping the child.Pediatric clinicians can provide meaningful intervention, even in the absence of a diagnosis, through expressions of hope, empathy, and support to the child and family; encouragement of healthy habits and reducing overall stress; emphasis on coping with or gradual exposure to feared activities, rather than avoiding them; and brief interventions derived from cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).Refer for full diagnostic evaluation and evidence-based care (CBT, plus medication for certain disorders) or comanage care with a mental health specialist ifThe child has severe functional impairments at school, at home, or with peers.Multiple symptoms of anxiety occur in many domains of life.The child or parent is very distressed by the symptom or symptoms.There are co-occurring behavioral problems (especially if combined with shyness).Anxiety was preceded by serious trauma or symptoms suggesting PTSD, acute stress disorder, or adjustment disorder.The child seems to have panic disorder or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), both of which require specialized treatment.Anxiety occurs in a child with autism spectrum disorder (ASD).",

      "title": "Role of Social Support as a Mediator in Negative Stressful Life Event and Somatic Complaints of Managerial Personnel",
      "abstract": "In this Complex life scenario employees have to face different challenging task that either related to work or to day to day life situation, both of these causes some sort of problem to employees. Sometimes they express these problems in term of their bodily discomfort or simply somatic complaints. Somatic complaints are increasing day by day in this complex life scenario. Some of them are caused due to physical disturbances in the body while some of them are due to psychological stress that employees get from their life events. Somatic complaints like headache, abdominal pain, backache, insomnia, dizziness, and fatigue are common among employees (Aro, Paroncn, & Aro, 1987; Goodman & McGrath, 1991). Such complaints are inversely related to well-being (Millstein, 1993).Somatic complaints are reported either as in descriptive or subjective reports. Somatic complaints are a descriptive term that does not reflect any preassumptions about etiology. Somatic symptoms are subjective reports of physical symptoms such as headaches, stomachaches, or muscle pain. The expression of somatic complaints as a manifestation of social or psychological distress is recognized cross culturally (Escobar & Gureje, 2007; Murphy, 1989) but in low- and middle income countries (LAMICs) its evaluation is complicated by the high burden of undiagnosed disease and under nutrition, as well as by limited access to health services.It is also viewed that psychosomatic complaints are important indicators of psychosocial health (Piko, 2007) and well-being (Bemtsson, Kohler, & Gustafsson, 2001). By definition, they are subjective physical complaints (headache, stomachache, back ache, and dizziness) as well as psychological complaints (feeling low, irritability, nervousness, and difficulty in getting to sleep that are not caused by an underlying physical disease (Natvig, Albrektsen, Anderssen, & Qvamtstrom, 1999, p. 362).There are multiple socioemotional factors associated with reports of somatic symptoms (Garralda, 2010), including stress and reduced coping abilities (Walker et al., 2007). Children with chronic disease may have poor coping skills that may be related to somatic symptoms (Stewart et al., 2010).Findings indicate that somatic symptoms are associated with high levels of co-morbid psychological symptoms, like anxiety and depression (Haug, Mykletun, & Dahl, 2004), as well as high levels of functional impairment (Mulvaney, Lambert, Garber, & Walker, 2006; Aromaa, Sillanpaa, Rautava, & Helenius, 2000). Different theoretical approaches have dominated the research in understanding somatic symptomatology. Empirical support has been found for the idea that life events perceived as negative or stressful for individuals have the potential to produce somatic symptoms (Murberg, 2012).A stressful or traumatic life situation is one that generates challenges on which the organisms cannot completely respond. Life stress refers to the psychological response state of disturbed affect in relation to stressors in one's life as whole (Parasuram, Greenhouse, & Granrose, 1992). Life stress can result from specific major events or the cumulative effect of daily hassles (Rowdena, Matthewsb, Watsona, & Biggs, 2011). The life events tradition focuses on the global impact of life changes. It covers a wide range of events that either be positive or negative in nature. Research has shown that stressors are detrimental not only to indicators of psychological well-being, such as mood, but also to somatic complaints (Spector & Jex, 1998). Among others, the stress response is characterized by the activation of the sympatheticadrenal medullar system, including increased heart rate, blood pressure, and catecholamine secretion. Over time, such reactions can result in the experience of somatic com-plaints, such as headache, back pain, and gastrointestinal problems.Social support is a significant feature of an individual's social environment and varying levels of support will be perceived as available to the individual in times of need (Snow, Swan, Raghavan, Connell, & Klein, 2003). …",

      "abstract": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of death and disability and is experienced by nearly 3 million people annually as a result of falls, vehicular accidents, or from being struck by or against an object. While TBIs can range in severity, the majority of injuries are considered to be mild. However, TBI of any severity has the potential to have long-lasting neurological effects, including headaches, cognitive/memory impairments, mood dysfunction, and fatigue as a result of neural damage and neuroinflammation. Here, we modified a projectile concussive impact (PCI) model of TBI to deliver a closed-head impact with variable severity dependent on the material of the ball-bearing projectile. Adult male Sprague Dawley rats were evaluated for neurobehavioral, neuroinflammatory, and neural damage endpoints both acutely and longer-term (up to 72 h) post-TBI following impact with either an aluminum or stainless-steel projectile. Animals that received TBI using the stainless-steel projectile exhibited outcomes strongly correlated to moderate-severe TBI, such as prolonged unconsciousness, impaired neurobehavior, increased risk for hematoma and death, as well as significant neuronal degeneration and neuroinflammation throughout the cortex, hippocampus, thalamus, and cerebellum. In contrast, rats that received TBI with the aluminum projectile exhibited characteristics more congruous with mild TBI, such as a trend for longer periods of unconsciousness in the absence of neurobehavioral deficits, a lack of neurodegeneration, and mild neuroinflammation. Moreover, alignment of cytokine mRNA expression from the cortex of these rats with a computational model of neuron-glia interaction found that the moderate-severe TBI produced by the stainless-steel projectile strongly associated with the neuroinflammatory state, while the mild TBI existed in a state between normal and inflammatory neuron-glia interactions. Thus, these modified PCI protocols are capable of producing TBIs that model the clinical and experimental manifestations associated with both moderate-severe and mild TBI producing relevant models for the evaluation of the potential underlying roles of neuroinflammation and other chronic pathophysiology in the long-term outcomes associated with TBI.",

      "abstract": "The interpretation of cerebral palsy (CP) is closely linked to points of view that are no longer acceptable: 1) the idea that it is primarily a motor problem (posture and movement disorder); 2) the idea that it is only a central (cerebral) pathology; 3) the idea that it is a non-progressive disease (fixed encephalopathy). Actually, the problems that contribute to producing the CP clinical picture are several and complex. First of all, building of the action, starting from subject motivation, through motor imagery and subsequent project elaboration. Sequentially, executive planning, disorder often hidden under the most remarkable alteration of motor patterns and muscle tone. Finally, realization, conditioned by the idea that the locomotor apparatus is only and always the victim of an incapable central nervous system. Little known and very neglected perceptive components can contribute to compromising subject motor control. The influences that primitive changes of musculoskeletal system, often depending on site, nature, size and time of the lesion, exert on the possible choices of the central nervous system are often overlooked. Peripheral structures can in fact modify considerably the expression of palsy (understood as the form of adaptive functions) primitively. At least six different sources of error can be identified in the cerebral palsied child. For a rehabilitative intervention with greater possibilities of effectiveness, it is necessary to recognize and evaluate each of them. Especially as regards the prevention of secondary deformities, the responsibility attributed to physiotherapy must be re-evaluated.",

Patients complain of pain described as burning, associated with sensory, vasomotor, sudomotor, motor and/or trophic disorders. The pain appears disproportionate to the initial lesion. The diagnosis is purely clinical and based on the Budapest criteria. It is a diagnosis of exclusion. The pathophysiology is still poorly understood and is thought to be multifactorial. Several mechanisms have been described: an inflammatory state, an overactivation of the sympathetic autonomic nervous system and a poor perception of pain at the central level. The management of signs and symptoms is therefore global. It involves physiotherapy and occupational therapy, often combined with analgesic medications. Psychological treatment may be proposed in certain circumstances.

It's a common condition in normal people, but most commonly in young people (pregnancy, exercise) and more in the elderly (50% after 65 years-old). A careful history and examination should allow the physician to determine the significance of cramp. ENMG and biological tests are needed in cases of severe symptoms (severity and frequency of cramps) and/or abnormal examination. Idiopathic and secondary (drug or metabolic disorders) cramps are the most common groups, but it's very important to search the motor unit diseases (neuropathy, radiculopathy, plexopathy, neuromyotonia, and a cramp fasciculation syndrome which can preceded ALS). The first goal in management of cramp is to determine if there is an underlying cause and the second to use physical measures (stretching), because, pharmacologic treatments have a moderate interest because of the potential of toxicity (quinine sulfate) or a little effectiveness (vitamin B complex, naftidrofuryl, and calcium channel blockers such as diltiazem, gabapentin).

      "title": "Trastorno del desarrollo de la coodinación : programas de intervención a través de la música, la danza y la percusión corporal (método BAPNE)",
      "abstract": "El Trastorno del Desarrollo de la Coordinacion (TDC) es una patologia relativamente reciente que afecta aproximadamente a un 5-8% de la poblacion infantil y tiene una prevalencia muy alta considerandose como una enfermedad cronica (Camden, Wilson, Kirby y Missiuna, 2014; Cantell, Smyth y Ahonen, 2003; Rasmussen y Gillberg, 2000). Afecta a ninos que no presentan ningun deficit cognitivo aparente pero que muestran un desarrollo motor deficiente para su edad, con limitaciones de coordinacion y dificultades para la realizacion de actividades cotidianas. El TDC suele coexistir con otras enfermedades. Su etiologia no ha sido aun definida por la comunidad cientifica, existiendo diferentes opiniones al respecto y tampoco existe unanimidad en cuanto al tratamiento. La importancia de una intervencion temprana se hace patente al analizar las consecuencias ya que las dificultades motrices entorpecen el desarrollo normal de su vida diaria, tanto en el hogar como en el ambito academico, lo que puede llegar a provocar estados de ansiedad, estres o depresion en los ninos. Es comun que eviten participar en actividades fisicas, causando aislamiento y sedentarismo, pudiendo desembocar en problemas de sobrepeso u obesidad. Nuestro objetivo general es evaluar la efectividad de un programa de intervencion basado en la musica, la danza y la percusion corporal, orientado a mejorar las capacidades motrices en ninos que estan en riesgo de problemas de coordinacion motriz. Sobre una muestra inicial de N=114 ninos de 6-8 anos, se crearon dos grupos control, (GCSR, sin riesgo de problemas motrices y GCR con riesgo) y un grupo experimental (GE) de ninos con riesgo a los que se le aplico el programa de intervencion. Se realizo un pretest en el que se administro el Test de Dominancia Lateral de A. J. Harris (1978) y la adaptacion espanola de la Bateria de evaluacion del movimiento para ninos- 2 (MABC-2; Henderson, Sugden y Barnett, 2012). Las puntuaciones escalares por debajo de 7 obtenidas en el MABC-2 se consideraron como punto de corte para establecer la existencia de dificultades de coordinacion y para la distribucion de la muestra. La intervencion aplicada al GE tuvo una duracion de 10 semanas con una sesion semanal de 50 minutos. El programa esta conformado por actividades grupales con caracter ludico basadas en la musica, la danza y la percusion corporal, conectadas con los contenidos del curriculo de Educacion Primaria y con las que se trabajan habilidades como la destreza manual, la integracion motora fina, la coordinacion bimanual, la agilidad y velocidad de las extremidades superiores o el equilibrio. Posteriormente, se realizo el postest basado en la administracion del MABC-2.\r\n En el analisis estadistico se utiliza un ANOVA con puntuaciones de cambio que permite comprobar la efectividad del programa con la mejora significativa del 100% de la muestra del GE, que en el pretest se encontraba dentro de la zona de riesgo y tras la intervencion, aumentan significativamente las puntuaciones escalares hasta 4 puntos, situandose fuera de dicha zona. Sin embargo, el GCR no evoluciono y mantuvo sus dificultades tras el postest.\r\n Tambien se llevo a cabo un ANOVA para dar respuesta al objetivo especifico que relaciona los efectos de la dominancia lateral con la ejecucion motriz de los ninos. Se comprueba que no existe dicha relacion, pero que la inconsistencia en el establecimiento de la lateralidad podal si supone unos peores resultados motrices. Del mismo modo, el conocimiento deficiente de la derecha y la izquierda se asocia a las dificultades de coordinacion. Asimismo, se observa un porcentaje muy alto de lateralidad cruzada, sin que esta conlleve una relacion directa con el riesgo de problemas motrices.",

      "abstract": "The article discusses the work of a psychologist with personality’s crises. Among them are personal crises, professional crises, and family crises. The author emphasizes that there are different crises. For example, a developmental crisis is a change that is a normal part of a person’s life and can be successfully experienced only when a person learns to cope with his or her situation. At the same time, a situational crisis is the result of an unexpected trauma. Sometimes these developmental crises or situational crises can occur simultaneously, and when this happens, the crisis is usually more devastating for the individual. The understanding of psychological trauma is also revealed and its peculiarities are indicated. It is determined that the consequences of trauma may include: changes in sleep patterns, panic attacks, withdrawal, obsessive thoughts, rather easy personality scaring, increased vigilance, etc. Some of the ways in which trauma can manifest itself in the body include: chronic illness or pain, sleep problems, frequent headaches or chest pain, etc. The author suggests ways of psychological assistance in case of crises and mental trauma, with an emphasis on the work of a psychologist in the method of art therapy, a form of psychological assistance based on safe and natural for a person fine arts, fairy tale therapy, phototherapy, sand therapy etc. It is emphasized that due to the creative process, art therapy can be a valuable therapeutic approach in dealing with trauma and personal crises. It is substantiated that the use of art to express emotions opens up access to both visual memory and bodily memory, as it not only allows people to create images. The use of art materials such as clay and paint can reconnect with physical sensations that may be cut off from their bodily sensations. Since researchers suggest that touch and sight are directly linked to the fear center in the human brain, art therapy is suitable for working with traumatic memory.",

Here, we propose that visual-vestibular conflicts per se do not cause sickness whereas subjective vertical mismatch theory can reconcile the disparate findings. The theory attributes the nausea induced by horizontal optokinetic stimulation to the subjects self-inducing pseudo-Coriolis by head movement.

      "title": "Suffering and the Dying Patient",
      "abstract": "SUMMARYSuffering in the dying patient derives from immediate sources of physical distress, perceived threats to the integrity of the self, and the psychological make up (memory, beliefs, expectations) of the individual at the end of life. The most common causes of somatic distress in dying patients with cancer are: (1) pain, (2) shortness of breath, and (3) nausea and/or vomiting. Other noteworthy problems include confusion, restlessness, itch, disturbed bladder and bowel function, sleep disruption, low energy, sedation and cachexia. Specific physiological mechanisms foster suffering in dying persons. These include tissue trauma, visceral distention and cardiovascular events. Neurological signals generated by tissue trauma or sensitization during inflammation lead to sensations of pain and also produce emotional arousal in noradrenergically innervated limbic brain structures. In addition, such signals stimulate the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenocortical axis. This creates a stress response which, if prolonged, disturbs circadian and ultracadian biological rhythms. One can direct preventative and palliative interventions toward such mechanisms. Patients also suffer because of unmet psychological needs or psychosocial problems. Identifying such needs or problems and addressing them can often contribute substantially to patient comfort. Since we have the resources to prevent or largely alleviate pain and other distressing conditions in the majority of cases, and care providers can meet most patients' psychological needs once they identify them, unaddressed suffering need not accompany death from cancer or other prolonged disease.",

      "abstract": "Although the prevalence of many psychiatric and neurologic disorders after head injury has been studied, there remains relatively little research on psychosis due to TBI. Psychosis due to TBI, also referred to as PD TBI in the literature is characterized by the presence of hallucinations and/or delusions in the aftermath of traumatic brain injury. The diagnosis is difficult to make because it requires the clinician to make a determination of whether the psychosis resulted from the brain injury or whether it is a manifestation of another illness. This can be particularly challenging because there can exist a significant lag between the time of head injury and onset of psychotic symptoms.

Migraine and other headaches, for example, have commonly been associated with TBI.",

      "abstract": "Tourette syndrome (TS) is a neuropsychiatric disorder with the onset in childhood. TS is a form of tic disorders, and characterized by the motor and vocal tics, and comorbidities such as attention deficit hyperkinetic and obsessive compulsive disorders. These symptoms appear age dependently, showing a wax and wane course, and subside or abolish by the late teens. Pathophysiology of TS involves the dysfunction of both motor and non-motor basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuitries. The nigrostriatal dopamine (DA) system takes the exponential decrement at the striatum. In TS, this decrement is accelerated in association with DA-D2 receptor super-sensitivity, which disinhibits the descending and ascending output pathways of the basal ganglia. Disinhibited motor basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuitries develop the specific tics according to the target sites. Hypofunction of the 5-hydroxytriptophan (5-HT) neurons of the brainstem innervate the striatum involved in non-motor basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuitries and cause the obsessive compalsive disorder and other behavioral disorders. The associated DA-D2 receptor supersensitivity is assumed to be a consequence of the developmental abnormalities and not due to denervation supersensitivity. The treatments of TS aim to correct the 5-HT hypofunction by improving the environmental factors and super-sensitized DA receptors medically by a small dose of levodopa and/or aripiprazole.",

Burst suppression is inducible by high doses of most anesthetics (Clark & Rosner 1973) or in profound hypothermia (e.g. used for cerebral protection in cardiac bypass surgeries) (Stecker et al. 2001); may occur pathologically in patients with coma after cardiac arrest or trauma as a manifestation of diffuse cortical hypoxicischemic injury (Young 2000), or in a form of early infantile encephalopathy (“Othahara syndrome”) (Ohtahara & Yamatogi 2006); and as a non-pathological finding in the EEGs of premature infants known as “trace alternant” or “trace discontinu.” The fact that these diverse etiologies produce similar brain activity have led to the current consensus view that (i) burst suppression reflects the operation of a low-order dynamic process which persists in the absence of higher-level brain activity, and (ii) there may be a common pathway to the state of brain inactivation.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Many medications affect the central nervous system (CNS) and can alter the patterns of sleep and wakefulness. Others can induce sleep disorders (eg, nightmares, periodic limb movements of sleep or restless legs syndrome) or exacerbate them (eg, obstructive sleep apnea). Some agents can cause both insomnia and excessive sleepiness in different individuals, or in the same individual under different circumstances. These can be a primary therapeutic effect of the drug, a withdrawal effect, or an adverse reaction. Each medication possesses class and agent-specific effects on sleep. Alcohol’s effect on arousal and sleep is biphasic. Alcohol has both stimulatory effects (at low doses and on the rising phase of alcohol levels) and sedative effects (at high doses and on the falling phase of alcohol levels). Metabolism of alcohol occurs at a constant rate of 10 to 20 mg/dl per hour. Alcohol’s sedating effect can be additive with other agents such as benzodiazepines. Acute ingestion decreases sleep latency, increases non–rapid eye movement (NREM) stages 3 and 4 sleep, and reduces rapid eye movement (REM) sleep during the first half of the sleep period (Table 16–1). It is metabolized quickly, and alcohol causes a rebound increase in the frequency of arousals and awakenings and an increase in REM sleep during the second part of the night. Nightmares and vivid dreams can occur. In addition, alcohol ingestion can cause worsening of snoring and obstructive sleep apnea by increasing upper airway resistance due to a decrease in pharyngeal dilator muscle tone.",

      "title": "To Study the Relationship between Level of Stress and Coping Strategies among Parents of Mentally Retarded and Autistic Children",
      "abstract": "Background: Stress generally refers to two things: the psychological perception of pressure, on the one hand, and the body’s response to it, on the other, which involves multiple systems, from metabolism to muscles to memory. Through hormonal signaling, the perception of danger sets off an automatic response system, known as the fight-or-flight response, that prepares all animals to meet a challenge or flee from it. A stressful event —whether an external phenomenon like the sudden appearance of a snake on your path or an internal event like fear of losing your job when the boss yells at you—triggers a cascade of hormones, including adrenaline and cortisol, that surge through the body, speeding heartbeat and the circulation of blood, mobilizing fat and sugar for fast energy, focusing attention, preparing muscles for action, and more. It generally takes some time for the body to calm down after the stress response has been triggered. Syle (1975) According to the World Health Organization (1994), approximately 156 million people or 3 percent of the world’s population have mental retardation. Coping has been defined as problem solving efforts made by an individual when the demands of a given situation tax adaptive resources (Lazarus et al., 1974; Pearlin & Schooler, 1978). Objective: To Study the relationship between level of stress and coping strategies among parents of mentally retarded and autistic children. Methodology: A sample of 70 parents i.e. 35 parents of mentally retarded children (18 fathers and 17 mothers ) and 35 parents of autistic children were taken from different institutions of Raipur (SAMWEDNA , ASHA DEEP & KOPALWANI ) and Chandigarh (PRYAAS) who were fulfilling the inclusion and exclusion criteria were selected for the present study. The tools used for assessing the variables are Socio Demographic Data Sheet (Self made), The Cope Scale (Carver et al., 1989) and Parental stress scale (Berry and Jones, 1995). Result: This study revealed that correlation between coping and parental stress in which significantly negative correlation was found in acceptance and turning to religion with parental stress.",

Dystonia patients suffer from reduced quality of life, which might be related not only to the dystonic movements itself but to different non-motor symptoms and signs, as well. Based on literature review, this chapter aims to focus on the association of different types of isolated/primary dystonia (forms of focal, segmental, and generalized dystonia) with some non-motor disorders, including sleep and psychiatric disorders, cognition, as though as pain and sensory symptoms, their pathophysiological and biochemical mechanisms, relations with the symptomatic treating strategies for the abnormal movements, and specific treatment for the non-motor signs.",

This may be so severe as to necessitate complete custodial care indefinitely; it may be so slight, that a simple change in environment or program may allow for relatively normal community activity with minimal to no supervision. For these different degrees of disability a wide variety of terms have been used. In decreasing order of disability, the terms most frequently employed including their definitions in terms of intelligence quotients are as follows: 1. Borderline: I.Q. 70-80 2. Moron or high grade: I.Q. 50-70 3. Imbecile or middle grade: I.Q. 20-49 4. Idiot or low grade: I.Q. 0-19 Such terms as feeblemindedness and mental retardation are generally used interchangeably for mental deficiency. Obviously, not all children failing to adjust socially or follow normal paths of development are so because of basic mental deficiency. Certain other conditions, either superficially or strikingly resembling mental deficiency states, must be differentiated. These latter conditions require a different and sometimes highly specialized therapeutic approach and any considerable delay in their recognition may adversely affect subsequent adjustment. The most common of these conditions include the following which are briefly described: 1. Delay in Educational Maturation: There is considerable variation in the time at which children of normal intellectual capacity reach the stage at which they properly react to the usual educational procedures, normally introduced at about 6 years of age. This so-called period of \"educational readiness\", for want of a better term, includes many aspects such as attention span, personal relations and socialization status, and may occasionally be delayed 2 or 3 years.",

It would be absurd to contend that such harm is somehow intrinsically less serious than physical injury; indeed, over many years, medical research has pointed to the artificiality of characterising it as lacking physical manifestations. Its destructive potential is brought into sharper focus as mental attributes become ever more integral to everyday functioning. Yet, to this day, neither popular nor judicial opinion is noticeably receptive to a cause of action based on proof of a “recognised psychiatric disorder”, which is still often trivialised by the label “nervous shock”. This negative attitude is most apparent when claimants are not, or are not regarded as, the direct victims of someone else's conduct.

Die Ursache liegt in einer Verlängerung einer Triplett-Repeat-Sequenz in einem spezifischen Gen, Huntingtin-Gen genannt. Bei einer deutlich erhöhten Anzahl an Triplett-Repeats, kann die Erkrankung bereits im Jugend- oder jungen Erwachsenenalter beginnen. Eindrücklichstes motorisches Symptom ist die Chorea, die sich in Form von unwillkürlichen, plötzlichen, kurzen Bewegungen darstellt. Bereits vor dem Auftreten von motorischen Symptomen können Patienten kognitive Einschränkungen entwickeln. Die kognitiven Einschränkungen betreffen primär Exekutivfunktionen wie beispielsweise Problemlösen. Als dritter großer Symptombereich können in jedem Stadium der Erkrankung psychiatrische Störungen hinzukommen. Häufig leiden Patienten unter Depressionen, später kommen vermehrt Irritabilität oder Perseverationen vor. Das Genprodukt Huntingtin ist ubiquitär in allen Körperzellen vorhanden – man vermutet verschiedene Funktionen, die insbesondere in Neuronen wichtig zu sein scheinen. Aufgrund des autosomaldominanten Vererbungsmodus hat die prädiktive Diagnostik bei dieser Erkrankung einen wichtigen Stellenwert. Trotz der Entdeckung der genetischen Ursache vor nun 25 Jahren ist die Behandlung der Huntington-Krankheit gegenwärtig noch auf die Therapie der Symptome und den Erhalt von Funktionen beschränkt. Für die Huntington-Krankheit gibt es noch keine Behandlung, die eine weitere Krankheitsprogression bremsen oder den Krankheitsbeginn verzögern könnte. Allerdings gibt es Hoffnung – klinische Studien mit Therapieformen, die auf die genetische Ursache abzielen, sind bereits auf dem Weg.",

      "title": "Patterns of motor disability in very preterm children",
      "abstract": "Abstract Motor development in very preterm children differs in several important ways from that of children born at full term. Variability is common, although the anatomic and physiologic bases for that variability are often poorly understood. Motor patterns over the first postnatal year may depend on behaviours learned during often long periods of neonatal intensive care. The normal pattern of development may be modified by disturbances of brain function caused both by the interruption of normal brain maturation ex‐utero and the superimposition of focal brain injuries following very preterm birth. Abnormal patterns of development over the first year may evolve into clear neuromotor patterns of cerebral palsy or resolve, as “transient dystonias.” Cerebral palsy is associated with identified patterns of brain injury secondary to ischaemic or haemorrhagic lesions, perhaps modified by activation of inflammatory cytokines. Cerebral palsy rates have not fallen as might be expected over the past 10 years as survival has improved, perhaps because of increasing survival at low gestations, which is associated with the highest prevalence of cerebral palsy. Children who escape cerebral palsy are also at risk of motor impairments during the school years. The relationship of these impairments to perinatal factors or to neurological progress over the first postnatal year is debated. Neuromotor abnormalities are the most frequent of the “hidden disabilities” among ex‐preterm children and are thus frequently associated with poorer cognitive ability and attention deficit disorders. Interventions to prevent cerebral palsy or to reduce these late disabilities in very preterm children are needed. MRDD Research Reviews 2002;8:241–248. © 2002 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

Rangsangan nyeri bisa disebabkan oleh adanya tekanan, traksi,\r\ndisplacement maupun proses kimiawi dan inflamasi terhadap nosiseptor pada\r\nstruktur peka nyeri di kepala. Selain itu nyeri kepala juga dapat diakibatkan oleh\r\nfaktor pikiran atau stress.\r\nSalah satu bentuk dari nyeri kepala primer adalah migrain. Migrain\r\nmerupakan nyeri kepala berulang dengan serangan nyeri yang berlangsung selama\r\n4-72 jam. Nyeri yang dirasakan berupa nyeri kepala unilateral, dan kadang\r\nbilateral, sifatnya berdenyut, yang dapat disertai mual, muntah dan gangguan\r\nvisual. Intensitas nyerinya sedang hingga berat. Nyeri kepala migrain juga dapat\r\ndiperberat oleh aktivitas fisik.\r\nPada kasus ini pasien mengeluhkan sering merasakan nyeri kepala yang\r\nhilang timbul sejak SMP. Nyeri kepala yang sering dirasakan berupa nyeri kepala\r\nsebelah yaitu pada samping kepala sisi kiri yang terasa berdenyut dan kadang\r\nnyeri berpindah, disertai dengan gejala mual. Faktor pemicu timbulnya nyeri\r\nkepala tersebut ialah gangguan emosional pasien yang cenderung pemikir.\r\nSindroma dari migrain yang dialami pasien yaitu Hiperaktivitas Yang Hati.\r\nPada studi kasus migrain ini dilakukan perawatan dengan terapi\r\nakupunktur pada titik Taichong (LV3), Xuanlu (GB5) dan Diji (SP8) yang\r\ndilaksanakan setiap 2 hari sekali selama 24 hari yang terbagi dalam 4 tahap terapi.\r\nSerta ditambahkan pula perawatan dengan terapi herbal, berupa sediaan infusa\r\nkunyit putih (Curcuma zedoaria Rosc.) yang diberikan selama 30 hari.\r\nHasil studi menunjukkan adanya penurunan keluhan nyeri kepala yang\r\ndirasakan pasien.

      "abstract": "SummarySpinal instability is ‘the loss of the ability of the spine under physiolgoic loads to maintain relationships between vertebrae in such a way that there is neither initial damage nor subsequent irritation to the spinal cort or nerve roots, and, in addition, there is no development of incapacitating deformity or pain due to structural changes’ (White and Panjabi, 1982).Spinal instability has been perceived and defined in different ways by several authors: 1 A clinical syndrome in which it is seen as the cause of recurrent acute back pain and of chronic back pain.2 An abnormality defined by imaging techniques, which reinforces the idea of laxity within the functional spinal unit and which then provides an indication for surgical stabilisation.3 A feature of disc degeneration which leads to abnormal biomechanics.These three definitions relate to an abnormality of the motion segment. The question then arises about manipulation: how does this abnormality influence decisions on the appropriate use of manipulation, where the paraphysiological zone (or functional barrier) of segmental mobility is affected?",

Quite often one might see a vertical down beat nystagmus in the head hanging position of Stenger's maneuver. iii) Saccadic or ataxic ocular pursuit in the eye tracking test, iv) Abnormal findings of the optokinetic after nystagums test, which could suggest some disorder in the central nervous system, usually decreased optokinetic after nystagmus v) Abnormal x-ray findings in the cervical spine, e.g. cervical spondylosis.Diseases which could cause vertigo or dizziness other then V.B.I. should be ruled out.A partient with abnormalities of all five items has definite V.B.I., one with four or three abnormal items has probable V.B.I., and one with two items has possible V.B.I., To establish these criteria of V.B.I., we analyzed 250 partients with vertigo experienced during the past three years. Peripheral vertigo was pressent in 39% and central vertigo in 23%. V.B.I. was diagnosed in 20% of the 250 patients.Our recent experience with 77 patients with V.B I. was also analyzed statistically.",

      "abstract": "The Sexual Tipping Point ® (STP) model is an integrated approach to the etiology, diagnosis and treatment of men with delayed ejaculation (DE), including all subtypes manifesting ejaculatory delay or absence [registered trademark owned by the MAP Educational Fund, a 501(c)(3) public charity]. A single pathogenetic pathway does not exist for sexual disorders generally and that is also true for DE specifically. Men with DE have various bio-psychosocial-behavioral & cultural predisposing, precipitating, maintaining, and contextual factors which trigger, reinforce, or worsen the probability of DE occurring. Regardless of the degree of organic etiology present, DE is exacerbated by insufficient stimulation: an inadequate combination of \"friction and fantasy\". High frequency negative thoughts may neutralize erotic cognitions (fantasy) and subsequently delay, ameliorate, or inhibit ejaculation, while partner stimulation (friction) may prove unsatisfying. Assessment requires a thorough sexual history including inquiry into masturbatory methods. Many men with DE engage in an idiosyncratic masturbatory style, defined as a masturbation technique not easily duplicated by the partner's hand, mouth, or vagina. The clinician's most valuable diagnostic tool is a focused sex history (sex status). Differentiate DE from other sexual problems and review the conditions under which the man can ejaculate. Perceived partner attractiveness, the use of fantasy during sex, anxiety-surrounding coitus and masturbatory patterns require meticulous exploration. Identify important DE causes by juxtaposing an awareness of his cognitions and the sexual stimulation experienced during masturbation, versus a partnered experience. Assist the man in identifying behaviors that enhance immersion in excitation and minimize inhibiting thoughts, in order to reach ejaculation in his preferred manner. Discontinuing, reducing or altering masturbation is often required, which evokes patient resistance. Coaching tips are offered on how to ensure adherence to this suspension, manage resistance and facilitate success. Depending on motivation level, masturbation interruption may be compromised and negotiated. Encourage a man who continues to masturbate to alter style (\"switch hands\") and to approximate the stimulation likely to be experienced with his partner. Success will require most men to be taught to learn bodily movements and fantasies that approximate the thoughts and sensations experienced in masturbation. Fertility issues, as well as patient/partner anger are important causational factors, which often require individual and/or conjoint consultation. Drug treatment would benefit men particularly with severe DE, regardless of concomitant psychosocial-behavioral and cultural complications. When and if a safe effective medication for DE becomes available, this author's transdisciplinary perspective supports appropriate medication use when integrated with counseling. This approach emphasizes the utility of a biopsychosocial-cultural perspective combined with special attention to the patient's narrative. Treatment is patient-centered, holistic and integrates a variety of therapies as needed.",

      "abstract": "Temporal patterns of physiological reactions during vehicle driving were summarized and discussed. Driving strain could be indicated by decrease of spare mental capacity or by degree of autonomic reactions. For variation of the cortical functions two major patterns were classified. In the case of automobile or electric railcar driving, an initial rise with succeeding gradual decrease of the critical fusion frequency of flicker was characteristic (C-type). Locomotive driving or driving in a monotonous situation usually lacked this initial rise and revealed from the first stage of driving a gradually decreasing tendency of cortical functions (L-type). In both types of variation pattern, prolonged driving over 3-4 hours always causes marked decrease of the cerebral activation level, which may induce more frequent detraction phases, thus tending to cause accidents. Since patterns of physiological reactions seem to be determined by the driving “situation” as a whole, it is urged-in order to reduce accidents, to design those driving situations which are less restric, tive and less monotonous, having proper stimulation on the cerebral cortex.",

      "abstract": "Kornelija Galinauskaitė1, Dalius Klimavičius1 1Lithuanian University of Health Sciences, Department of Psychiatry, Kaunas, Lithuania Abstract Introduction: Tourette’s syndrome is characterized by characteristic involuntary movements, tics, with both motor and background components. Tourette’s syndrome usually begins around the age of 5-7 and worsens during puberty. Tics are repetitive, slightly stereotypical involuntary movements of the eyes, face and head, phonations (pronunciation of speech sounds, words, or phrases). Tourette’s syndrome is reduced or less intense in many patients as they grow older, suggesting that the underlying mechanisms involve processes that can improve as the brain matures. Self-harming behaviors occur in up to 53% of patients with Tourette’s syndrome, including compulsive scratching of the skin, self-tapping, biting lips and other parts of the body, knocking of the head, and injury to the eyes due to their starvation. Clinical case: this clinical case presents a 14-year-old adolescent who develops Tourette’s syndrome in an intense self-harming tic. Various diagnostic studies have been performed to differentiate Tourette syndrome from other neurological disorders. The various medications tested did not have a positive effect until treatment with risperidone was finally prescribed, which improved the patient’s symptoms. Conclusions: self-harm is a common and frustrating symptom of Tourette’s syndrome. Risperidone may be effective in treating the symptoms caused by Tourette’s syndrome. Key words: Tourette syndrome, risperidone, self-harming, tics.",

Evidence for this linkage comes from a literature review, from patient interviews, from responses to an instrument we have developed (the Self‐Harm Behavior Survey), and from three instructive case reports. Even if the self‐mutilation in these patients is regarded as a Borderline Personality Disorder symptom, DSM‐IV should list it as an associated feature or a complication of Anorexia Nervosa/Bulimia Nervosa. In lieu of a dual diagnosis, we postulate that the combination of self‐mutilation, anorexia, bulimia, and other symptoms (such as episodic alcohol abuse and swallowing foreign objects) may be manifestations of an impulse control disorder known as the “deliberate self‐harm syndrome.”",

Hyperkinetic movement disorders (also called dyskinesias) are excessive, often repetitive, involuntary movements that intrude into the normal flow of motor activity. This category includes chorea, dystonia, myoclonus, stereotypies, tics, and tremor. Hypokinetic movement disorders are akinesia (lack of movement), hypokinesia (reduced amplitude of movement), bradykinesia (slow movement), and rigidity. Parkinsonism is the most common hypokinetic movement disorder. In childhood, hyperkinetic disorders are common, whereas hypokinetic movement disorders are relatively uncommon.",

Lesional headaches follow a sinusitis or an arthrosis, or accompany a \"temporal arteritis of Horton\". Functional headaches include several varieties. 1. Trigemellar neuralgia. 2. Vascular algia originating from the basal arteries, the large cerebral venous sinuses or the branches of the external carotid. Among these are: a) headaches due to a dilatation of the internal wall, causing \"Horton headache\", migrain-like psychosomatic migraine and hormonal migraines (premenstrual, menstrual, menopausal or linked to the use of contraceptive pills); b) headaches caused by an angiospasm of the arteriole, which is the case in exposure to the cold, in traumatic headaches (malfunction of temporomandibular articulation, dry alveolitis), in psychosomatic angiospastic algias and in ethmoidal artery algias previously described by the author in 1949 (Godin's disease). 3. Headaches due to psychic hypertension. 4. Postconcussional psychogenic headaches. 5. Neurotic headaches. The author gives a detailed description of the subjective symptoms in each case, including localisation, form, intensity, duration course and associated phenomenons. This facilitates greatly the differential diagnosis and the choice of complementary examinations. Necessary biological investigations should be performed (e.g. hormonal balance). One should however avoid to increase the number of complementary examinations which would only delay treatment and would expose patients to somatisation. Furthermore, in each case drug treatment, periarterial infiltration technics of the temporal, internal frontal, facial, mastoid and occipital arteries are described. The necessity of questioning the patient at length and to listen to him to enable him to verbalise conscious conflicts is emphasized. A serious medicopsychological examination and a relaxation treatment to reduce anxiety and muscular tension are advised in some cases.",

Symptoms of ADHD are reported in 15-80% of TS patients, and include impulsivity, inattention, distractibility, and hyperactivity. Secondary causes of tics, referred to as tourettism, and tics may accompany other medical conditions, such as Huntington's disease, neuroacanthocytosis, Wilson's disease, and Sydenham's chorea. One-third of children have tics or TS that remit or improve as they approach adulthood. Most patients develop strategies with medication, social support, and behavioral compensation that allow for management of the most difficult of symptoms, and with time the disabling components of the disorder are minimized.",

      "title": "REM sleep behavior disorder - past, present, and future",
      "abstract": "The REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a fascinating experiment of nature predicted by animal experiments nearly 40 years ago. Active paralysis of somatic muscles is one of the defining features of REM sleep. In the catmodel of REM sleep behavior disorder, bilateral perilocus ceruleus lesions result in loss of the expected atonia of REM sleep, resulting in dream-enacting (oneiric) behaviors. In humans, REM sleep behavior disorder presents as complex behaviors arising from REM sleep, as the persistence of muscle tone during REM sleep permits the acting out of dreams, often with violent or injurious consequences to the patient or bed partner. These behaviors include talking, yelling, swearing, grabbing, punching, kicking, jumping, or running out of the bed and may result in lacerations, ecchymoses, or fractures. The acute, or transient, form is usually drug-induced (most commonly tricyclic antidepressants [TCAs] or serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs]). REM sleep behavior disorder may also be a manifestation of narcolepsy. The chronic form is seen predominantly in men (80-90%) over 50 years of age. Initially felt to be idiopathic, it is now becoming apparent that spontaneous REM sleep behavior disorder is often a harbinger of degenerative neurological conditions, most commonly one of the synucleinopathies (Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, or dementia with Lewy body disease). Interestingly, the symptoms of REM sleep behavior disorder precede any other manifestations of the underlying neurodegenerative disorders by an average of over 10 years. It is readily diagnosed by formal sleep studies which reveal persistence of muscle tone during REM sleep. Most cases of REM sleep behavior disorder respond dramatically to clonazepam administered at bedtime.",

      "title": "Non-Conventional MRI Techniques in Neurophychiatric Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (NPSLE): Emerging Tools to Elucidate the Pathophysiology and Aid the Diagnosis and Management",
      "abstract": "Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder affecting multiple organ systems. 30-40 % of the patients manifest variable neuropsychiatric symptoms leading to significant morbidity and mortality. CNS involvement could be primary if directly related to SLE activity in the CNS or secondary to treatment, infections, metabolic abnormalities or other systemic manifestations such as hypertension (Futrell et al,1992). Primary NPSLE is divided into focal and diffuse disease. Focal NPSLE is characterized by focal neurologic deficits and is strongly associated with the occurrence of thromboembolic events. Diffuse primary NPSLE is a group of neurologic, psychiatric, and cognitive syndromes that vary from overt neurologic and psychiatric symptoms (eg. seizures, psychosis) to more subtle signs such as headache, mood disturbances, anxiety disorders or mild cognitive dysfunction. Neuropsychiatric lupus (NPSLE) manifestations can occur in the absence of either serologic activity or other systemic disease manifestations (Sibbit et al., 1999). Thus, in clinical practice the diagnosis of primary NPSLE is rather presumptive, after the exclusion of alternative causes of the neuropsychiatric symptoms. There is no single diagnostic test that is sensitive and specific for SLE-related neuropsychiatric manifestations. The assessment of individual patients is based on clinical, neurologic and rheumatologic evaluation, immunoserologic testing, brain imaging, and psychiatric and neuropsychological assessment. These examinations are used to support or refute the clinical diagnostic impression, rule out alternative explanations, and form the basis for prospective monitoring of clinical evolution and response to treatment interventions. The lack of a diagnostic gold standard makes the correct diagnosis of primary NPSLE a challenge. This realization has led us in developing under the auspices of the European League Against Rheumatology (EULAR) evidence and expert based recommendations for the management of NPSLE (Bertsias et al, 2010).",

      "abstract": "Mild weakness, with hypotonia, often referred to as the \"floppy infant syndrome\", is a well-recognised problem in infancy. The syndrome includes several neuromuscular disorders characterised principally by the changes found in the muscle biopsy (Table 16.1). The term \"floppy infant\" (Dubowitz 1980) has replaced the older terminologies of amyotonia congenita and benign congenital hypotonia (Walton 1956). The clinical syndrome consists of reduced resistance of joints to passive movements and increased range of movement of joints. Affected infants usually show reduced spontaneous movements, and older children have delayed motor development milestones. These features can result from myopathies, including metabolic disorders such as glycogen storage disease, or from neurogenic disease, for example spinal muscular atrophy or motor neuropathy. However similar clinical features are also found in children with disorders of the central nervous system, especially cerebral palsy, birth trauma, and hypoxic injury. Metabolic encephalopathies may also cause hypotonia. Additional causes include connective tissue disease, e.g. mucopolysaccharidosis and Ehlers—Danlos syndrome, Prader—Willi syndrome and reversible metabolic diseases, e.g. rickets and hypothyroidism. In a few cases the syndrome is not associated with any underlying cause and with increasing maturity the hypotonia resolves (Dubowitz 1980).",

Treatment for the disorder is essentially the same as that for Tourette's, in that it is considered part of a continuum of all tic disorders that last over one year. In addition to medication to suppress the tics, behavioral programming and supportive psychotherapy are recommended to deal with the impact the disease has on the school, social, and family life of the child. Treatment for this disorder is generally aimed at the reduction of stress in the child's environment. The disorder should be monitored carefully for development of Tourette's Disorder or Chronic Motor or Vocal Tic Disorder.",

Akuter Beginn der Erkrankung, variable Ausprägung der Symptomatik, Ablenkbarkeit und spezielle klinische Provokationsmanöver helfen bei der Diagnosestellung. So weisen ein akuter Beginn des Tremors oder aber auch eine spontane Remission, eine rasche Verschlechterung mit Ausbreitung auf den gesamten Körper mit anschließendem statischen Verlauf auf eine mögliche psychogene Ursache hin. Die Schilderung der Symptome durch den Patienten kann entweder von einer „belle indifférence“, d.h. mit einer abnormen Gleichgültigkeit gegenüber der Schwere der Erkrankung vorgetragen werden, die der Behinderung nicht angemessen erscheint. Der psychogene Tremor fällt durch die Variabilität in Amplitude und Frequenz auf, außerdem tritt er eher am Unterarm als an den Fingern auf, zeigt somit einen abnehmenden Gradienten von proximal nach distal. Manche Formen fallen auch durch eine bizarr anmutende Ausgestaltung oder eine an eine Tätigkeit erinnernde Form auf (Teigrührer-Tremor). Der Distraktionstest macht sich die Tatsache zunutze, dass die meisten organischen Bewegungsstörungen unter mentaler Anspannung eher zu- als abnehmen. Beim kontralateralen Aktivierungstest wird der Patient aufgefordert, eine Position einzunehmen, in der der Tremor am stärksten ausgeprägt ist. Dann soll er mit der nicht-tremorösen Hand auf einen vorher vereinbarten Punkt zeigen. Bei Bewegungsstart kommt es zu einem kurzfristigen Sistieren des Tremors auf der kontralateralen Seite. Dieses Sistieren tritt sowohl beim Parkinson-Tremor als auch beim essentiellen Tremor nicht auf. Beim Entrainment-Test fordert man den Patienten auf, einen Takt mit einer Hand zu klopfen, dessen Frequenz vorgegeben und variiert wird. Ein psychogener Tremor wird in der Regel aus dem Rhythmus gebracht werden, kurzfristig sistieren oder sich an den Klopf-Rhythmus anpassen.",

It has been demonstrated<sup>1</sup>that there is little or no correlation between the severity of the mental disturbance and the physical symptoms; children with slight mental disturbance may have extreme physical findings and vice versa.

      "abstract": "Many symptoms of brain injury (e.g, difficulties with speech, intellectual functions, concentration, flatness or lability, distractibility) bear a close resemblance to inhibitions and compromise formations evident in problematic intrapsychic development. Disturbances in intrapsychic function can have an organic basis, and errors in differential diagnosis can result when therapists do not consider intrapsychic and organic damage in combination. Brain-injured individuals need others who are comfortable providing auxiliary functions, particularly as an aid in managing anxiety. Understanding the operation of anxiety after brain injury can further the capacity of these individuals to attain and maintain more gratifying interpersonal relationships.",

      "title": "Searching for methods of rehabilitation in neglect syndrome patients - a review W poszukiwaniu metod rehabilitacji chorych z zespołem zaniedbywania - przegląd zagadnień",
      "abstract": "Unilateral neglect syndrome, a difficulty in reporting, responding, or orienting to novel or meaningful stimuli presented within the contralesional hemispace, is a common consequence of brain injury that cannot be explained by primary sensorimotor defects. It is a heterogeneous cluster of cognitive deficits usually resulting from right hemisphere damage affecting the left part of the body and space. Right hemineglect also occurs, but is much less frequent. Even though about half of patients tend to recover from neglect relatively quickly and spontaneously, chronic forms of the disorder are associated with slowed motor function recovery, poor response to rehabilitation, and difficulties in many everyday activities. This article reviews the theoretical approaches and efficacy of different strategies of neurorehabilitation including such groups of therapeuticmethods as: psychological techniques of compensation (scanning training, lateralized cueing), techniques of sensory modulation (optokinetic stimulation, vestibular stimulation, transcutaneous nerve and muscle stimulation), techniques of sensorimotor plasticity activation (eye patching, adaptation to prism lenses, trunk rotation), and techniques of balancing interhemispheric interactions (limb activation therapy, transcranial magnetic stimulation). Despite years-long clinical observations and numerous experimental studies verifying usefulness of different interventions, it is not clear yet whether one rehabilitation technique is appropriate for all hemineglect patients and diverse manifestations of neglect. Some authors claim that combination of different techniques may produce additive benefits (e.g. linking of specific psychological interventions with sensory manipulation, improving of attention and visuospatial abilities, self-awareness training or pharmacological treatment).",

Objetivos: Revisar as características e pontos principais da migrânea. Materiais e Métodos: revisão narrativa realizada em bases de dados digitais, livros e informações de organizações de referência mundial. Resultados: A migrânea é um tipo de cefaleia primária de alta prevalência, sendo mais comum em mulheres. Pode ser com ou sem aura – sintomas neurológicos focais que precedem a dor – ou crônica. Caracteriza-se por cefaleia pulsátil, unilateral, de intensidade de moderada a grave, associada a náusea, vomito, foto ou fonofobia e que se agrava com atividades físicas rotineiras. Deve ser diferenciada de outras cefaleias primarias e, quando na presença de sinais de alarme, também das secundárias, em especial se na terceira idade. Fatores como odores e luzes fortes, consumo de bebida alcoólica, certos alimentos, jejum prolongado, distúrbios do sono e ciclo menstrual podem desencadear uma crise. Seu tratamento pode ser farmacológico ou não, além de envolver medidas gerais; e pode ser sintomático ou profilático – mais indicado em casos mais graves ou refratários. Dentre os medicamentos utilizados durante as crises há os específicos (triptanos e derivados da ergotamina) e não específicos (analgésicos e anti-inflamatórios não esteroidais). Conclusão: Conclui-se que a migrânea deve ser reconhecida e diagnosticada correta e precocemente, objetivando uma terapêutica adequada e individualizada para que se alcance uma melhora na qualidade de vida do paciente.",

L'exces de vigilance que representent la tension (stress) ou l'hyperexcitation a un pouvoir de degradation plus rapide sur les activites complexes que sur les activites les plus simples. Il y a donc un niveau optimal de vigilance pour chaque type de tâche realisee et la degradation de la performance peut etre liee a de l'hypovigilance ou de l'hypervigilance. L'effet du manque d'experience des jeunes conducteurs pourrait se faire particulierement sentir dans des situations de conduite difficiles ou des situations auxquelles ils n'ont pas forcement ete confrontes lors de leur apprentissage, mais aussi dans des situations ou l'effet de plusieurs facteurs d'accident est additif. En ce sens, un etat de surcharge de travail pourrait entrainer un etat de forte tension et d'hypervigilance chez les jeunes conducteurs novices. A l'inverse, l'ingestion d'un psychotrope tel l'alcool pourrait avoir un effet deletere sur leur comportement de conduite lors de situations monotones de longue duree, et favoriser la baisse de vigilance.

      "title": "[Psychological stress and sudden death].",
      "abstract": "Recent studies provide relevant evidence that psychological stress significantly influences the pathogenesis of sudden cardiac death. Psychological stress expresses a situation of imbalance, derived from a real or perceived disparity between environmental demands and the individual's ability to cope with these demands. A situation of psychological stress may include different components: personality factors and character traits, anxiety and depression, social isolation and acute or chronic adverse life events. In particular, it has been documented that a sudden extremely hard event, such as an earthquake or a war strike, can significantly increase the incidence of sudden death. Nevertheless, each one of these factors, if not present, can balance a partially unfavorable situation; this overview suggests a multifactorial situation where almost all elements are present and in which the relative influence of each one varies according to the individual examined. Sudden death occurs when a transient disruption (such as acute myocardial ischemia, platelet activation or neuroendocrine variations), occurring in a patient with a diseased myocardium (such as one with a post-necrotic scar or hypertrophy), triggers a malignant arrhythmia. Psychological stress acts at both levels: by means of a \"chronic\" action it contributes to create the myocardial background, while by means of an acute action it can create the transient trigger precipitating sudden death. In the chronic action two possible mechanisms can be detected: the first is a direct interaction, which contributes to cause a hypertension status or to exacerbate coronary atherosclerosis consequent to endothelial dysfunction; the second one acts through adverse health behaviors, such as a poor diet, alcohol consumption or smoking. In case of acute psychological stress, the mechanisms involved are mainly the ability to trigger myocardial ischemia, to promote arrhythmogenesis, to stimulate platelet function, and to increase blood viscosity. Finally, some individuals have a sympathetic nervous system hyper-responsitivity, manifesting as exaggerated heart rate and blood pressure responses which result in accelerated atherosclerosis.",

The second phenomenon:An abnormality of vision of peripheral oscillopsia, persisting from the time of the same acute-fear experience. The third phenomenon: A high probability of stepwise simultaneous elimination of both visual phenomena follows the maneuver of repeatedly exposing each voluntarily evoked visual-image and other sensory memory to volitional rapid side-to-side eye movements, as per one aspect of eye movement desensitization and reprocessing.This maneuver leaves the memory stored and recalled normally (i.e., nonexperientially) and vision oscillopsia-free. Clinical features of patients with the visual phenomena are unique to each patient.The authors report further observations over 25 years on the wide spectra of difficulty, intensity, and/or obtrusiveness of each of the three visual phenomena and of three closely related clinical features. Relevant clinical findings pertaining to the visual phenomena in 100 recent consecutively referred patients are reported.The strong inference of these observations induces a schema: a further refinement of the construct posttraumatic stress disorder, together with a visual state marker.",

Thus it was not considered to be a movement disorder. On the other hand, because akathisia was not listed in either the diagnostic index or the symptom index of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, third edition, revised (DSM-III-R) (American Psychiatric Association, 1987), its status as an abnormal subjective state was ill-defined within psychiatry. Akathisia's uncertain status probably has contributed considerably to its neglect as an important and disabling neurological and psychiatric condition. Until recently, the persistent form of akathisia due to neuroleptics, referred to as tardive akathisia, has been particularly neglected. The early reports of classic oral-buccal-lingual tardive dyskinesia included clear descriptions of chronic motor restlessness: “[the] patient cannot stand still” (Uhrbrand & Faurbye, 1960); “inability to sit still” and “pacing the floor” (Kruse, 1960); “patients could not remain seated” (Hunter, Earl, & Thornicroft, 1964). In addition, the phenomenon of acute akathisia due to neuroleptics was clearly recognized shortly after the introduction of those drugs; and it was considered one of the most common adverse effects of neuroleptics (Ayd, 1961).",

It is however the unmasterable subjective experiences such events provoke that injure the mind and ultimately the brain. Further, traumatic over-arousal may arise from inner affective deluge with minimal external stimulation. Affects that promote suicide when sufficiently intense are reviewed; we propose that suicidal crises are often marked by repetitions (flashbacks) of these affects as they were originally endured in past traumatic experiences. Further, recurrent overwhelming suicidal states may retraumatize patients (patients who survive suicide attempts survive attempted murders, albeit at their own hands). We propose that repeated affective traumatization by unendurable crises corrodes the capacity for hope and erodes the ability to make and maintain loving attachments.",

      "title": "Being psychotic is not necessarily being ill: Psychotic continuum and the relevance of lacanian psychoanalytic approach",
      "abstract": "Introduction The notion of subclinical psychosis is as old as Eugen Bleuler’s work on schizophrenia. It is also consistent with psychodynamic theories (see PDM-2) on the organization of personality on different levels including, among others, a psychotic level of personality organization. Research on the continuum of psychosis has offered substantial support to the view that psychotic phenotypes are significantly more prevalent than clinical psychosis. Objectives This may imply that being “psychotic” is not necessarily being ill. This assumption raises important theoretical and clinical questions: what causes psychosis to manifest itself clinically and, conversely, what possibly prevents it from doing so? Methods At the same time, it potentially frees psychiatry from certain diagnostic and therapeutic impasses. It allows for a shift of emphasis from misguiding classifications and often frustrating “evidence-based” therapeutic attempts to a more personalized approach. Results Diagnosis may thus rely on psychoanalytical “markers” or “indicators” regarding the subject (e.g. deficits in the symbolic register, dysregulated rapport with one’s body, problematic inscription in social relations etc.) at least as much as on symptomic phenomenology. Therapy may also take advantage of and deploy the unique coping strategies employed by the psychotic individual. Conclusions The diagnostic and therapeutic insights offered by Lacanian psychoanalysis create the possibility of a fruitful theoretical, diagnostic and therapeutic approach for clinical and subclinical psychotic conditions; indicate that psychoanalysis is indispensable for clinical psychiatry; and signal the possibility of a time-honored alternative to the in-vogue neurocognitive paradigm of “personalized” psychiatry.

Its goal is to provide readers with a practical and educational overview of managing these symptoms. Cognitive disorders, including dementia, result from the disruption of higher cortical functions of the brain. Dementia often manifests not only through cognitive dysfunction but also through BPSD, such as agitation, aggression, anxiety, psychosis, and sleep disturbances. These symptoms affect up to 97% of patients with dementia and significantly reduce the quality of life for both patients and caregivers. BPSD are often more stressful for patients and caregivers than the cognitive symptoms themselves. Behavioural symptoms include a wide range of manifestations from non-aggressive forms such as pacing and repetitive movements to aggressive and agitated behaviour (verbal and physical). Psychological symptoms can include depression, anxiety, and psychotic symptoms such as paranoia and delusions. The causes of BPSD can be varied, as well as their risk factors (including e.g. co-medication, comorbidities, the patient's personality traits, inappropriate communication by caregivers, and environmental influences). The pharmacotherapy of BPSD is complex and often involves the use of antipsychotics, antidepressants, benzodiazepines, or acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and memantine. Due to the diversity of manifestations and causes of BPSD, a unified pharmacotherapeutic approach cannot be applied. Non-pharmacological approaches should always be preferred, except in cases of severe depression, psychosis, or aggression that may endanger the patient or someone else. In practice, many medications indicated for BPSD therapy are used off-label. The pharmacotherapy of BPSD should only begin after ruling out other causes of BPSD. Furthermore, it should only be initiated after considering all risks and potential benefits, starting with low geriatric doses, monitoring side effects, regularly reassessing effectiveness, and administering medications for the shortest possible duration should be also applied.",

The intellectual deficits include problems in abstract and logic thinking, problem solving, reasoning, learning from experience and judging. The deficits in adaptive functioning appear in problems in social communication and participation as well as in mental overload phenomena caused by daily life activities. This overload often results in psychopathological features and psychosocial reactions which are usually observed in Burn-out-Syndromes as e.g. general exhaustion (depletion of primarily reduced mental resources), additional reduced efficacy (accompanied by feelings of insufficiency and poor self-esteem), and most typically feelings alienation (towards intrinsically familiar situations, towards relatives and friends and at least also against oneself ) typically accompanied by irritability and dysphoria. Treatment programs therefore should not only focus on intellectual deficits but should include also the multiple sufferings from psychopathological phenomena and psychosocial effects of such daily life overload syndromes.

In the past, CD was considered a psychiatric disorder, and terms such as 'torticollis mentalis' were used to describe the condition.2 The reasons for this misconception arise from its unusual movements, worsening with certain actions or postures, enhancement by stress, improvement by touches or 'tricks' and the lack of anatomic, physiologic, and biochemical abnormalities.3 Patients were referred to psychiatrists, some receiving inpatient psychiatric treatment, counseling, and electroconvulsive therapy for 'hysteria'.4 Subsequently, the neurologic basis of CD was recognized, it was redefined as a subtype of focal dystonia and is now referred to as cervical dystonia.3,5CD is marked by deviation of the head around horizontal (torticollis), coronal (retrocollis, anterocollis), and vertical axis (laterocollis), often associated with reduced range of motion in the direction contralateral to the movement.6 CD has been categorized into three types associated with dystonic muscle activation: tonic, phasic, and tremulous.7 Horizontal rotation is the most common abnormal movement, present in approximately 80% of patients. Electromyography in superficial neck muscles showed that this posture typically arises from activity of the sternocleidomastoid muscle contralateral to the turn and splenius capitis muscle ipsilateral to the direction of turn. Deeper muscles, including the longissimus capitis, splenius cervices, longus capitis, and obliquus capitis, can also be involved. Laterocollis is seen in 10-20% of patients, and is associated with electromyographic activity in ipsilateral splenius, sternocleidomastoid, and levator scapulae muscles. Retrocollis and anterocollis are less frequent, and involve bilateral posterior and anterior muscles, respectively. In most patients, these movements are not present in pure form, with combinations of torticollis and laterocollis.",

Although affected patients may appear to have a neurological disease such as multiple sclerosis or epilepsy, no structural disease process is evident, nor are symptoms deliberately feigned. Instead, brain function is disordered; hence, current preference for the term “functional neurological disorder.” Conversion symptoms exist at the interface between neurology and psychiatry and remain a common cause of disability and distress. The conundrum of hysteria was essential to the development of Freudian psychoanalytic theory, which today is only one of many competing hypotheses to explain these intriguing symptoms.",

Although research studies sometimes require a speciﬁc quantitative deﬁnition, a patient’s subjective judgment that sleep is insufﬁcient, inadequate, or nonrestorative is the most important factor in clinical practice. Insomnia is the most common sleep complaint. Transient insomnia lasts less than one week, and short-term insomnia one to four weeks. Chronic insomnia, insomnia lasting more than one month, affects between 10% and 35% of the population in the western world (3,4). The number of chronic insomniacs rises with age, and women of all ages complain of insomnia more often thanmen (3,5). Insomnia is frequently associatedwith othermedical complaints and psychological symptoms, particularly anxiety, worry, and depression. Stressful life events (difﬁculties in interpersonal relationships, family discord, problems at work, and ﬁnancial troubles) may also generate a nonrestorative sleep complaint. Insomnia is not a speciﬁc illness or disease, but rather a symptom or consequence of other primary disorders. “Poor quality of sleep” is a common complaint in the family members of chronic insomniacs. However, it is difﬁcult to gauge the extent to which the emotional problems favouring the onset of a sleep disorder in adulthood are due to a genetic predisposition or the result of having lived in a family burdened by affective problems and/or interpersonal conﬂicts.",

Additional impairment of the central nervous system is often indicated by clinical findings of brisk patellar tendon reflexes or the occurrence of Babinski's sign.",

      "abstract": "Tourette syndrome is a hereditary, childhood-onset neurodevelopmental disorder. It is characterised by uncontrolled movement/unwanted sounds (tics) that are followed by a generalised urge (uncomfortable bodily sensation) that cannot easily be controlled. Estimates of its prevalence in children range from 0.3 to 0.8 percent, but rates of 0.3-0.8 percent are believed to accurately represent the disorder's occurrence. It has effects on cognitive, psychological, emotional, and social development. Males are about three to four times more likely to develop the syndrome. There is no cure for Tourette syndrome, treatments are there just for tic control if severe, and interferes with a child's quality of life. The purpose of the chapter is to understand what Tourette syndrome is, its causes, symptoms, effects, and strategies to manage and support the affected. The research method used was a desktop literature review and oral history.",

Associated strokes and cerebral hemorrhages are not uncommon. As complications we can see Localized cortical SAH (20-25%), Ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke (5-10%), posterior reversible encephalopathic syndrome ( PRES). Permanent sequelae of RCVS is usually benign entity. Prognosis is highly dependent on the occurrence of stroke (6-9%), otherwise, by definition, most resolve completely without any sequelae. Treatment is Symptomatic (pain, seizures, blood pressure control), trigger avoidance should be done (either activity or vasoactive substances), calcium channel blockers, IV magnesium and Short-course of steroids may be effective.",

Drugs affecting several neurotransmitters were developed, such as the serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), which, as the name suggests, inhibited the reuptake of both serotonin and norepinephrine, and they have become increasingly popular. The SNRIs now being marketed are not only used in the treatment of depressive disorders, but serve in the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder, social anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), chronic neuropathic pain, fibromyalgia , and relief of menopausal symptoms.",

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) refers to long running disturbances in emotion, cognition, and behavior owing to having encountered frightening, disruptive, and often life-threatening experiences. These traumatic experiences are relived in such a way that the past, even a past that took place decades ago, is ever present. Common fear reactions often abate within brief periods of time. In contrast, PTSD is enduring and can sometimes last for as long as one lives. It is dysregulating across a wide variety of domains of functioning. PTSD can cause extreme fear reactions to common stressors; it can cause disruptions in one's memory and thinking process; it can cause startle reactions and sympathetic nervous system over-activation; can negatively alter one's mood; diminish one's sense of self; cause sleeplessness and nightmares, disrupt relationships, and cause an enduring distrust of the environment. To help in developing a perspective on PTSD, it is important to note that most people who encounter traumatic events do not develop PTSD.",

Most instances of CTE occur in association with the play of collision sports, such as American football and boxing, but CTE has also been found after brain trauma associated with military combat, physical abuse, poorly controlled epilepsy, and repetitive head banging. The symptoms of CTE usually begin years after the trauma has ceased and include depression, explosivity, and loss of attention, concentration, and short-term memory. As CTE progresses, executive dysfunction and cognitive impairment develop, with dementia, word-finding difficulties, and aggression common in advanced CTE. Motor neuron disease (MND) is also found in 10%–12% of CTE cases (CTE+ MND). Pathologically, CTE is characterized by the accumulation of aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau protein as neurofibrillary tangles, neurites, and astrocytic tangles in widespread regions of the central nervous system.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Suicide is a traumatic event for close relatives due to various factors, with bullying acting as a mediator. Bullying has been identified as a primary predictor of suicidal ideation and a contributing factor to suicide. Objective: This study aims to describe the pathway from bullying victimization to suicidal attempts in adolescents. Results: Adolescence is a period of peak physical health and a time of behavioral and emotional problems due to developmental factors, which can increase susceptibility to suicidal behavior. Adolescents who experience bullying report suicidal ideation more frequently, often on a weekly basis, due to psychiatric morbidity (OR = 7.78). The relationship between bullying and suicide is mediated by poor physical and mental health, especially among victims. Bullying victimization triggers psychological or behavioral problems that can lead to suicidal behavior, often mediated by mental health or psychological problems, such as internalization or substance use which serve as maladaptive coping strategies, with suicide ultimately becoming a final coping strategy. Conclusion: Psychological or mental health problems mediate the risk of suicidal attempts among bullied adolescents, although other pathways may also be involved.",

      "title": "A case of frontal lobe syndrome",
      "abstract": "Frontal lobe syndrome is a broad term used to describe the damage of higher functioning processes of the brain such as motivation, planning, social behavior, and language/speech production.[1] It can occur due to disease, head trauma, or tumor. It is characterized by a change in personality and behavior in a previously normal individual. A 17-year-old boy, educated up to 9th std, living with parents and younger sibling, was brought to the psychiatry outpatient department with complaints of irritability, aggressive behavior, easy distractibility, restlessness, impulsive behavior, inappropriate social behavior, and wandering tendency since 1.5 years. The patient was apparently alright 1.5 years back when he met with a road traffic accident (RTA), sustained closed head injury, and had right ear bleed, following which he had loss of consciousness for 18 days requiring ventilatory support. On regaining consciousness, the patient had memory loss for events a few days prior and multiple days after the RTA, irritability, anger outbursts, impulsivity, abusive behavior, overfamiliarity, jocularity, wandering behavior, disinhibition, and distractibility. He had unprovoked bouts of aggression and would start abusing those around him. He could not sit still for any task and would leave conversations midway, focusing his attention on some other activity. When he got unmanageable at home, he was shown to a psychiatrist a month after the accident and he was prescribed: tablet risperidone 3 mg + tablet trihexyphenidyl 2 mg, tablet olanzapine 5mg BD, and valproate 250 mg BD. The treatment was partially effective in treating his mood and behavioral changes, but symptoms still persisted. There is no significant past medical history, no family history of any psychiatric illness, and no history of substance use. His general physical and systemic examinations were within normal limits. On central nervous system examination, anosmia was present, grip was reduced in the left hand, dysdiadokokinesia showed frequent sequencing errors, and gait was suggestive of frontal ataxia. On the Frontal lobe assessment patient score was: 5/18 (normal score of 15); motor functions: grip strength was reduced on the left side; fine motor speed was reduced in the left hand with errors; premotor functions: sensorimotor integration was slower in the left hand; dorsolateral/ executive functions: complex and directed attention was normal; multiple response alternatives: open set F, A, S beginning words – very poor, behavioral inflexibility: Luria's bilateral hand movements – negative; Wisconsin card sorting test was abnormal; orbital/inhibitory functions: behavioral disinhibition – go no go test was abnormal, Stroop test was abnormal; anosmia was present; abnormal behavior during testing: poor/no insight into deficits, inappropriate social behavior, perseveration present, easily agitated, and hyperactive. From the above tests, we concluded that the patient had loss of executive functions along with disinhibition which is seen in frontal lobe syndrome (dysexecutive syndrome). Mental status examination revealed overfamiliarity, jocularity, and disinhibited behavior. Speech was spontaneous with increased rate, monotonous, nasal voice, unclear words and increased reaction time. His mood was irritable and labile. Delusions/ obsessions/ suicidal ideas were absent. X ray skull showed multiple frontal bone fractures. CT scan of brain showed bilateral frontal bone fractures, orbital and maxillary injuries along with extensive edema. With the diagnosis of frontal lobe syndrome, he was treated with tablet olanzapine 5 mg BD and tablet valproate 500 mg BD. Our case report demonstrates the drastic change in behavior and personality in a patient with traumatic brain injury causing damage to the frontal lobe. He was an above-average student prior to the RTA but could not function normally since then and was unmanageable at home with frequent bouts of unprovoked aggression. He also required supervision to carry out daily activities. Frontal lobe is responsible for higher mental functions including executive functions, voluntary movement, and language and is prone to injury due to its placement. It is also considered the behavior and emotion control center and home to our personality, injury to which can lead to serious consequences. Frontal lobe damage can have devastating consequences on the patient as well as the relatives. Psychotropic medications can be used to an extent to control the behavioral disturbance and rehabilitation could be useful for support, although prognosis is poor for such patients.

      "title": "The Seesaw Brain: \"Highs\" and Adaptations",
      "abstract": "Abstract The brain resists any disturbance in its neurochemical equilibrium. It recognizes a chemical change immediately, then adapts to it slowly. An addictive drug that mimics or blocks a neurotransmitter or receptor is like a weight thrown suddenly onto one side (let’s call it the drug side) of a balanced seesaw. The sum of all the adaptations is like a counterweight added slowly to the opposite side (the adapting side) until the level state is reached again. If a drug floods the brain suddenly (a drug spike), an immediate change in brain function results. In the vernacular, if this effect is hedonic (pleasurable), it is called a drug “high;” the drug side of the seesaw drops. If the same drug is trickled slowly into the brain instead of spiking, adaptations can occur even while the drug level is increasing; the “high” is muted or nearly absent, while a plateau drug level is established.",

      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) reflects a mental illness that can develop after a person has experienced or witnessed a traumatic event such as a natural disaster, accident, terrorist attack, war/combat, sexual assault, or other violent acts.[1] Symptoms usually begin within 3 months of experiencing the traumatic episode(s), although these may occasionally develop earlier, and last for over a month. The most typical symptoms fall into four categories, encompassing intrusive memories (e.g., periodic distressing reminders of the traumatic episode), avoidance behaviors (avoidance of people or places reminiscent of the traumatic episode), negative changes in thinking and mood, along with changes in physical and emotional responses (i.e., arousal symptoms).[1] The historical epidemiology of PTSD suggests that between 5 and 10% of the general population may be affected by this condition at some point in their lives,[2] although coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has contributed to significantly increase the prevalence of PTSD, with almost 20% of COVID-19-discharged patients showing symptoms.[3] Given this concerning epidemiology, the search for effective treatment options for patients with PTSD has become increasingly important in recent years. Among the various agents that have been proposed, heparin represents an intriguing perspective.",

      "abstract": "El Trastorno por Deficit de Atencion con Hiperactividad (TDAH, en lo sucesivo), constituye uno de los trastornos del desarrollo neuropsicologico que en la actualidad afecta a mas ninos y adolescentes, se estima una prevalencia de en torno al 5%, segun el DSM-V (American Psychiatric Association, 2013); y en el que coexisten diversos sintomas que van a ocasionar a la persona que lo padece serias dificultades para poder adaptarse de forma optima a los contextos en los cuales se ve inmersa. Dicho trastorno se caracteriza por un patron persistente de hiperactividad/impulsividad y/o inatencion superior a lo esperado de acuerdo con el nivel de desarrollo del individuo, apareciendo antes de los doce anos y alterando el funcionamiento normalizado del sujeto a nivel academico, familiar y social (Barkley, 2006; Lavigne y Romero, 2010; Miranda, 2000, 2004; Perez, 2009; Servera, 2005). El problema del que se parte para llevar a cabo nuestro estudio gira en torno a la escasa cantidad de investigaciones que existen con el objetivo de analizar los deficit que van mas alla de estos tres sintomas categoriales y que se producen a nivel social y emocional en los sujetos con Trastorno por Deficit de Atencion con Hiperactividad; especialmente en comparacion con el robusto cuerpo de estudios que se han llevado a cabo para profundizar en el origen y desarrollo de las alteraciones de corte cognitivo y conductual, asi como en las diferentes opciones que se ocupan de su diagnostico y tratamiento. Por tanto, la tesis que a continuacion se presenta, surge con dos objetivos fundamentales: en primer lugar, con el de proporcionar un modelo de comprension y explicacion del TDAH que, ademas de abordar los deficit de origen cognitivo y conductual, atienda al papel que las emociones desempenan en el comportamiento de las personas que padecen el trastorno, como influyen en su desarrollo y dominio social, asi como que relacion establecen con el resto de procesos neuropsicologicos implicados. Para ello, se llevara a cabo en la Parte Primera del estudio (capitulos 1o, 2o, 3o, 4o y 5o), una revision del concepto, las caracteristicas y los modelos explicativos mas extendidos en torno al origen y desarrollo del trastorno, particularmente en relacion con sus dificultades emocionales y sociales. En la Segunda Parte (capitulos 6o, 7o y 8o), se exponen los resultados de la investigacion llevada a cabo con una amplia muestra de personas con TDAH y sus familias, con el objeto de comprobar y analizar los beneficios de una intervencion especifica Emocional, Social y Cognitiva; disenada para potenciar procesos emocionales de identificacion, expresion y regulacion emocional, y consecuentemente: reducir problemas emocionales, mejorar sus habilidades socio-comunicativas y pragmaticas, potenciar sus habilidades mentalistas, sociales y de resolucion de conflictos. Ademas, se analiza la relacion que otras variables pueden tener sobre dichas competencias: como la edad de los participantes y el tipo de tratamiento recibido; asi como se comparan dichos resultados con los de un grupo control. Para poder llevar a cabo este tratamiento psicoeducativo, se ha elaborado y aplicado un Programa de Intervencion Emocional, Social y Cognitivo, destinado a ninos con TDAH de edades comprendidas entre los 7 y los 14 anos, y a sus padres.",

Many features that are important in terms of driving adversely affected under the influence of alcohol and substance and therefore impaired driving behavior arises in drivers.The most effective way to fight for preventing this impaired driver behav- ior is the restrictions and regulations imposed on drivers in traffic related to alcohol and drug use. Nevertheless, in the literature, some drivers continue to impaired driving function with a risky traffic behavior, in which the driver personality (risk-taking, thrill-seeking, self-control), psychopathologi- cal (substance abuse, personality disorders, mood disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, anger and aggression), and many other neuropsychological features are considered to have a relationship with this situation.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION We are all personally familiar with the startle response – the abrupt ‘start’ or ‘jump’ in response to sudden unexpected stimuli, like a loud noise. This startle is a nonsuppressible reflex, which alerts us to abrupt changes in our environment that may threaten our safety. It is a reflex with survival value. But, if excessive or too easily triggered, it can interfere with daily functioning, or cause falls or injuries, and it is then a pathological response. The startle reflex is thought to be mediated at the level of the midbrain or below, because it is still elicited in decerebrate animals (Forbes & Sherrington 1914). The intensity of the startle reflex in humans varies between individuals and is increased by anxiety, fatigue or emotion (consider your response to a door slamming as you are watching a late night horror movie). Pathological startle syndromes can be divided into (Fig. 1): Primary",

      "abstract": "Abstract *Verlaet Myriam, †Suzuki Toshimitsu, *Lakaye Bernard, *Chanas Grazyna, †Yamakawa Kazuhiro, ‡Delgado-Escueta Antonio, and *Grisar Thierry ( *Center for Cellular and Molecular Neurobiology, University of Liège, Liège, Belgium ; †Laboratory for Neurogenetics, RIKEN Brain Science Institute, Saitama, Japan ; and ‡Epilepsy Genetics/Genomics Laboratories, Comprehensive Epilepsy Program, UCLA School of Medicine, and VA GLAHS-West Los Angeles, Los Angeles, U.S.A. ). Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy is distinguished from other hereditary generalized epilepsies by age of onset (8–20 years) and the observation of isolated myoclonic jerks that are not necessarily preludes to major tonic–clonic seizures. Myoclonic activity occurs characteristically in the morning, soon after waking, and forces the patient to drop objects. The EEG shows 15–30 Hz multispike-wave complexes. Moreover, 3.5–6 Hz multispike-wave complexes sometimes appear in clinically asymptomatic family members (Delgado-Escueta and Enrile-Bascal, 1984). By studying 21 families from Mexico, Delgado-Escueta and collaborators (Suzuki et al., 2003) encountered a novel gene. This gene encodes a protein whose domain revealed an EF-hand motif, suggesting a role in binding and modulating intracellular calcium. Mutational analysis revealed five missense mutations appearing in epilepsy or EEG spike-wave–affected members of six unrelated families. Sleep deprivation, fatigue, and alcohol could affect mutations in this gene, decrease calcium binding, increase intracellular calcium concentrations, and shift voltage to the depolarizing potentials of epilepsy. Thus, the putative calcium binding activity of the protein coded by this gene should be investigated. Ca2+ imaging was first used to show myoclonin protein localization in HEK-293 cells transfected with EGFP wild type cDNA. We observed changes of EGFP signal localization after thapsigargin-induced intracellular Ca2+. Using quantitative PCR, we have detected transcripts of this gene in different mouse tissues, such as brain, thymus, kidney, pancreas, liver, heart, lung, spleen, skeletal muscle, and stomach, with a very high number of copies in testis but also in various cell lines. To study the potential partner(s) of the myoclonin protein, we have realized two yeast hybrid experiments. Identification of some potential partners are in progress (Delgado-Escueta, Enrile-Bascal, Neurology 1984;34285–94; Suzuki et al., Am Acad Neurol 2003:S14.004).",

      "abstract": "Psychosis is a group of psychotic disorders. Its manifestation depends on the specific type of functional violation. However, this is characterized by a gradual increase in clinical signs and a change in behavior. Symptoms of psychosis can be recognized by the following manifestations: hallucinations, delusional ideas, movement disorders, mood disorders including manic and depressive disorders and changes in emotional sphere. Psychosis occurs due to problems in the functioning of neurons. Due to the violation of bonds in the molecules, they do not receive nutrition and they are deficient in oxygen. This leads to the fact that neurons cannot transmit nerve impulses; multiple dysfunctions occur in the central nervous system. The type of psychosis depends on a part of the brain suffered from the hunger strike. The causes of this disorder are of 3 types: endogenous, associated with internal processes, exogenous or external and organic, when the causes of psychosis are changes in the brain such as tumors, trauma or hemorrhage. Psychosis is usually treated in a hospital setting. Such patients require urgent admission as they cannot control their actions, they can harm themselves and others. Psychosis is a relapse-prone disease. With timely and comprehensive treatment, the prognosis will be favorable. This review article is a good educational material for medical and psychological practitioners whose goal is to improve knowledge of treatment and rehabilitation processes of psychosis and its related disorders.",

      "title": "Rhythm and timing as vulnerabilities in neurodevelopmental disorders",
      "abstract": "Millions of children are impacted by neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs), which unfold early in life, have varying genetic etiologies and can involve a variety of specific or generalized impairments in social, cognitive and motor functioning requiring potentially lifelong specialized supports. While specific disorders vary in their domain of primary deficit (e.g. autism spectrum disorder (social), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (attention), developmental coordination disorder (motor) and developmental language disorder (language)), comorbidities between NDDs are common. Intriguingly, many NDDs are associated with difficulties in skills related to rhythm, timing and synchrony though specific profiles of rhythm/timing impairments vary across disorders. Impairments in rhythm/timing may instantiate vulnerabilities for a variety of NDDs and may contribute to both the primary symptoms of each disorder as well as the high levels of comorbidities across disorders. Drawing upon genetic, neural, behavioural and interpersonal constructs across disorders, we consider how disrupted rhythm and timing skills early in life may contribute to atypical developmental cascades that involve overlapping symptoms within the context of a disorder's primary deficits. Consideration of the developmental context, as well as common and unique aspects of the phenotypes of different NDDs, will inform experimental designs to test this hypothesis including via potential mechanistic intervention approaches. This article is part of the theme issue ‘Synchrony and rhythm interaction: from the brain to behavioural ecology’.",

      "abstract": "Thus, an assumption of the personality of old age or of a state of fatigue or weakness, induced through the second signal system, leads to a substantial reduction in the cortical tonus, which spreads to the subjacent nerve structures. As a consequence there is a sharp inhibition of conditioned and, in part, of unconditioned reflexes. Moreover, active cortical inhibition suffers particularly, and external inhibition is more pronounced. Upon \"return\" from this state of \"inhibition\" to the customary, real age or condition, one observes steady inhibition and, in some cases, positive induction. This confirms the presence of cortical inhibition in an arbitrarily induced condition of age or fatigue. If the subject regards himself as being of a younger age or in a more vigorous situation than usual, this will induce a certain increase in the reflexes.",

The present case study investigates about the causes that may lead to the occurrence of impulse control disorders in adolescence and also discusses about the applications of Habit Reversal Training (HRT) through the case of an adolescent boy presenting with complaints of hair pulling, taking out weird sounds from the throat and jerking the neck repeatedly. He was being managed using pharmacotherapy but with little improvement and hence was referred for psychotherapy. As the therapy progressed, a drop in symptom severity was observed. Academic and emotional diiculties may contribute signiicantly towards anxiety and agitation in adolescence leading to various forms of psychopathology.

      "abstract": "Depression and moral masochism are inseparable, and originate in a particular climate of lived experience in which one or both parents suffer from a masochistic-depressive disposition. Developmentally, there has been a deficit in the child's experience of shared pleasure, and of being a source of enjoyment to the parent. Instead, the child experiences himself or herself as a source of pain and feels responsible for the parent's dysphoric, anhedonic state. This is not simply a fantasy construction of the child, as parental reproachfulness is characteristically encountered. The child makes reparative efforts, but they generally do not succeed. Central psychological capacities are compromised under these conditions, particularly a sense of personal efficacy and of natural entitlement. The evolution of initiative, autonomy, and individuation are also significantly affected. The aggression, both conscious and unconscious, which is generated by these early conditions creates intrapsychic conflict which further inhibits the development of these essential psychological functions. Some therapeutic recommendations are proposed based on these considerations.",

      "title": "Social trauma : consequences of emotional maltreatment on physiological reactions to social rejection in subjects with social anxiety disorder",
      "abstract": "A history of child maltreatment is associated with psychopathology, predominantly affective and anxiety disorders as well as substance abuse. In the past, research has primarily focused on the consequences of physical abuse, sexual abuse, physical neglect or combinations of these types of maltreatment. However, besides physical and sexual transgressions, child maltreatment does also involve emotional abuse and emotional neglect. Although it was suggested that the consequences of emotional maltreatment might be as severe as the outcomes of physical or sexual maltreatment, there is little knowledge about the unique effects of emotional maltreatment on psychopathology. However, there is a growing body of evidence for an association of emotional maltreatment by caretakers and psychopathology, particularly social anxiety.\r\nIn addition to emotional maltreatment that involves abuse and neglect by parents and other caretakers, emotional abusive treatments (also referred to as emotional victimization) are highly prevalent among peers. Similar to emotional maltreatment by parents or caretakers, emotional peer victimization contributes to various forms of general psychopathology, e.g., depression, anger-hostility, dissociation, and drug use. However, peer victimization is particularly associated with characteristics of social anxiety disorder.\r\nSocial anxiety disorder (SAD) is a common anxiety disorder, which is characterized by persistent fear of social or performance situations, fear of negative evaluation, social avoidance of general and new situations, as well as physiological symptoms in social situations. However, the mechanisms that associate emotional maltreatment by caretakers as well as peers and social anxiety are still unknown. Models of cognitive vulnerability suggest that negative learning experiences establish associative information structures in memory that activate various stereotype and pathological behavioral programs in similar situations. This conceptualization predicts that social events may provoke more intense reactions in emotional maltreated subjects as such situations trigger associative response elements of social traumatic experiences. \r\nA key element of emotional maltreatment is social rejection. Experiences of social rejection elicit negative mood, emotional distress, and activity of neural networks that are associated with the processing of physical pain. However, because physiological reactions to social rejection were found to be ambiguous, there remains a need for clarification of the impact and direction of social rejection on other physiological measures such as heart rate and skin conductance. In socially anxious subjects, social rejection elicited immediate and delayed effects on psychological outcomes. Therefore both, physiological reactions in healthy subjects as well as increased psychological reactions in socially anxious subjects were suggested in previous studies. However, a combination of these, i.e., an investigation of physiological reactions in socially anxious subjects, was not presented, yet. This might be of specific interest, as fear of social rejection is one of the core components of social anxiety. Accordingly, socially anxious subjects should present stronger and prolonged physiological reactions to social rejection.\r\nHowever, there is so far minimal evidence that experiences of aversive social situations evoke an associative network and an activation of associative memory processing. The aim of the present work was to address this point and to explore the impact of prior emotional maltreatment on physiological reactions to social rejection. In addition, it was assumed that associative memory representations are potential links between maltreatment and social anxiety disorder. Thus, the effect of a history of emotional maltreatment on the experience of potential traumatic social events was expected to be even stronger for subjects with SAD.\r\nIn a first step, the association of emotional maltreatment with social anxiety was examined. Results indicate a relation of childhood maltreatment with psychopathology, and in particular, social anxiety symptoms. Moreover, it was demonstrated that the relative impact of emotional forms of abuse and neglect might even be higher than indicated by previous research on child maltreatment, which had mainly focused on physical and sexual types of abuse and neglect. Moreover, emotional maltreatment mediated the association of physical maltreatment and social anxiety. In addition to emotional maltreatment through parents and other caretakers, reports of emotional peer victimizations were independently related to social anxiety symptoms. Thus, it was concluded that symptoms of social anxiety are mainly predicted by emotional types of victimization, either in childhood through the caretakers, or during childhood and adolescence through peers.\r\nAs a second step, physiological reactions to social rejection were examined in healthy subjects. The results suggest that social rejection evokes reactions of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) apparent in accelerated heart rates. Although the effects of social rejection did not imply changes of skin conductance levels, it was concluded that the autonomic nervous system is affected by experiences of social exclusion indicating that behavior activation rather than inhibition is associated with socially threatening events. \r\nAfter that the link between social rejection and physiological reactions had been established, it was examined whether these reactions are affected by histories of emotional maltreatment and symptoms of social anxiety. Data suggested that reactions to an episode of social exclusion were primarily influenced by the degree of relational peer victimization rather than by the diagnosis of SAD. While an increase in skin conductance immediately after the exclusion was observed for all groups of subjects, this physiological response was attenuated among the subjects with a history of peer victimization.\r\nIn general, the results provided evidence for the existence and significance of associative networks and associative memory processing that is established by experiences of emotional maltreatment. In line with memory models of traumatic events and network models of emotional processing, a history of emotional maltreatment altered physiological reactions to a social challenge. After it has been demonstrated that experiences of emotional maltreatment place individuals at risk for symptoms of social anxiety disorder, findings indicate that associative information processing may account for an enhanced cognitive vulnerability for social anxiety. Although the mechanisms involved remain uncertain, it may be speculated that altered physiological reactivity in subjects with a history of emotional maltreatment contributes to the development of social anxiety. \r\nImportantly, the findings of the present research highlight the role of emotional forms of abuse and neglect in the development of a wide range of psychological disorders. Besides the impact of emotional maltreatment on social anxiety, the present research suggested influences of emotional maltreatment on various types of psychopathology. These findings establish a cross-diagnostical perspective on the consequences of emotional maltreatment. Assuming that experiences of emotional abuse and neglect account for various forms of symptomatology, it may be speculated that a plurality of patients would benefit from treatments that address these experiences. Therefore, the development of therapeutic interventions that combine disorder-specific treatments with an approach that focuses on adverse life experiences including social trauma should be a main goal of future clinical research.",

      "abstract": "The onset of disorders such as stroke and traumatic brain injury (TBI) is often sudden but is frequently followed by persistent and disabling long-term neuropsychiatric consequences. Few posttraumatic neuropsychiatric symptoms and syndromes are more disruptive to interpersonal familial, societal, educational, and occupational functioning and activities than agitation, aggression, and violent behaviors. Agitation and irritability that occur in a patient during the acute stages of recovery from TBI not only endanger the safety of the patient and his or her caregivers but also predict increased lengths of hospital stay and impaired cognition (Bogner et al. 2001). As recovery continues, low frustration tolerance and explosive behavior may develop in response to minimal provocation or sometimes may occur without any warning at all. These behaviors may be limited to irritability or may include violent outbursts resulting in damage to property or assaults on others. In severe cases, it may be unsafe for individuals with aggressive disorders to remain in the community or with their families, and referral to long-term psychiatric or neurobehavioral facilities is sometimes required. All clinicians, and especially mental health professionals, need to be knowledgeable about and able to evaluate and treat neurologically induced agitation, irritability, aggression, and violence among their patients with TBI.",

      "title": "Peculiarities of affective and posttraumatic response in patients with a history of combat traumatic brain injury depending on its severity: analysis of symptoms and principles of therapy",
      "abstract": "Background. Since 2014, as a result of hostilities in the Anti-Terrorist Operation – Joint Forces Operation (ATO-JFO) area and the full-scale invasion of Ukraine by the Russian Federation, cases of combat-related traumatic brain injury (cTBI) have become much more frequent, with consequences that significantly affect the daily life of civilians, fundamentally destroying the sense of security, causing constant stress, the psychological consequences of which are dangerous for both the patient and others. The internal stress and discomfort they cause exceed human capabilities. We can distinguish socio-psychological, physical, economic and medical factors that affect the health of the population in wartime. During the war, social problems arise that are directly related to the emergency situation, namely: family separation, lack of security, loss of livelihoods, breakdown of social ties, low level of trust, lack of resources, children growing up without parents, etc. As a result, mental health problems arise, including exacerbation of existing mental illnesses, changes in mental health due to suffering, acute reactions to stress, alcohol and drug abuse, and the development of depression and anxiety. Purpose – the study was to determine the peculiarities of psychopathological symptoms, namely, depression, anxiety and post-traumatic disorders, in servicemen with TBI due to blast exposure. Materials and methods. We examined 350 servicemen with combat-related traumatic brain injury, who were divided into three groups depending on its severity: 145 people had mild TBI, 125 people had moderate TBI, and 80 people had severe TBI. The study of the features of affective and posttraumatic symptoms was carried out using the Symptom Check List-90-Revised (SCL-90-R), the DASS-21 depression, anxiety and stress scale and the military version of the Mississippi Posttraumatic Stress Scale. Results. The index of obsessive-compulsive symptoms (OCS), which reflects the presence of obsessive thoughts or actions that are subjectively perceived by the individual as violent, insurmountable, and arising against his or her will, was naturally high in servicemen who took part in combat operations and suffered TBI. In the surveyed contingent, it reflects, first of all, the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder. In patients with mild TBI, the index of ACS was significantly higher than normal (1.98±0.49 points), in patients with moderate TBI it was significantly higher (2.12 ± 0.39 points), and in patients with TBI it was the highest (2.37 ± 0.45 points). Differences in the indicators of obsessive-compulsive symptoms between all groups by the severity of TBI were statistically significant (p &lt; 0.01). Interpersonal sensitivity, manifested by feelings of personal inferiority and inadequacy when comparing oneself with other people, was low in patients with mild TBI (0.81 ± 0.76 points). In patients with moderate TBI, the score on this scale was also within the normal range, although significantly (p &lt; 0.05) higher than in patients with mild TBI (1.17 ± 1.02 points). In the group with TBI, the interpersonal sensitivity score was significantly (p &lt; 0.01) higher than in the other two groups (1.48 ± 0.76 points) and exceeded the norm, which, in our opinion, can be explained by the influence of the main symptoms of TBI, which significantly worsens the state of health, cognitive and socio-psychological functioning, and the influence of posttraumatic stress symptoms. Conclusions. Thus, we have identified significant differences in the state of the psychoemotional sphere of patients with TBI due to blast exposure. Patients with mild TBI have the lowest severity of psychopathological (depressive, anxiety, post-stress, psychosomatic) symptoms. This gives us grounds to recommend the widespread use of psychocorrection, psychotherapy and social and psychological adaptation measures in such patients. The presence of sufficient psychological resources in such patients in the form of minimal severity of psychopathological symptoms will significantly reduce the psychopathological consequences of TBI, stabilise the state of the psycho-emotional sphere and ensure full recovery of mental and social functioning.",

      "abstract": "From a sprained ankle to a brain injury to a total hip replacement, when something limits our ability to move or perform daily activities, life can be miserable. This is where physical therapists (PTs) step in. PTs help people--from the very young to the very old--restore function, improve mobility, relieve pain, and prevent or limit permanent physical disabilities. As Director of University of Delaware's Infant Motor Behavior Lab, PT Cole Galloway helps infants born at high risk for movement problems learn to coordinate head, arm, and leg actions. Within a few days of working with very young infants, he realized he had found his niche. Overview of the field. PTs help people with physical disabilities, caused by a range of conditions, improve mobility and relieve pain. The conditions PTs treat may be orthopedic (bone-, joint-, and muscle-related) such as a fracture, dislocation, or osteoporosis; neurological (brain-related) such as a stroke, traumatic brain injury, or Parkinson's disease; or cardiopulmonary (heart- and blood vessel-related) such as congestive heart failure or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. PTs work in a variety of settings, including hospitals, private practices, home-health agencies, schools, sports-and-fitness facilities, company offices, nursing homes, and research labs within universities. Finding a niche. I love movement--whether through playing sports or dancing--so it seems natural to have a career that allows me to help people who have significant problems moving. I began my path with an undergraduate degree in biology and exercise science, followed by an additional bachelor's degree in physical therapy (at the time, a graduate degree was not required). I then went to work at a wonderful rehab hospital for several years, helping adults with severe brain and spinal cord injuries. I really enjoyed my work there, but at the same time, it led me to consider a whole host of research questions about the brain and how best to help people relearn to use their arms and hands after brain injuries. So, I went back to school for a doctorate in neurophysiology (basically, how the brain works). From that experience, I realized I was very interested in the control of reaching movements, so I started at the very beginning--studying how reaching first emerges in infants. Helping babies move. I run a research lab within the Department of Physical Therapy. We help infants born with injuries--usually of the brain or spinal cord--who have difficultly learning to use their hands for reaching or their legs for walking. For instance, we create specific play activities for babies with reaching problems, which allow families to help their children learn to use their arms and hands. To enable babies with leg-movement problems to explore their worlds, we are developing robot-assisted power wheelchairs (also called power chairs). This project is especially exciting as we get to work with engineers to develop a vehicle that is fun and functional for very young infants. …",

El consumo de drogas entre la clase medica, y en concreto en la especialidad de anestesiologia (1, 2) , representa un gran problema ocupacional, debido a que involucra la drogadiccion en el ambito laboral del medico. Estas situaciones pueden derivar en un proceso de degradacion progresiva del profesional en su vida personal, profesional y en su salud. En ella pueden interactuar diversos factores, como la predisposicion genetica, factores psicosociales, biologicos, historia familiar y personal de abusos, estres laboral cronico y el facil acceso y disponibilidad a la droga en el trabajo. La drogodependencia puede generar consecuencias personales, familiares y laborales (3, 4) . Las personales se relacionan con un progresivo deterioro en su vida y en su salud, sindrome de abstinencia, trastornos de angustia, depresion, llegando a la muerte por suicidio y por sobredosis. Las familiares se vinculan a altas tasas de divorcios y patrones de desmembramiento familiar. Las laborales tienen que ver con incapacidad de realizar sus tareas habituales, probabilidad de errores medicos, pudiendo llegar incluso a la mala praxis. Ante la mas minima sospecha, se debe realizar un proceso de identificacion y la correspondiente intervencion, para ayudar al medico e incluirle en programas de tratamiento especificos.

      "title": "Psychiatric conditions",
      "abstract": "In reviewing psychiatric syndromes, some themes recur. This does not lead to a general theory of disorder, but to an analysis that has some general features. Set against a developmental background, disorder is viewed in relation to the tasks that must be achieved where multiple sets of mental rules are possible. These include the monitoring of internal and interpersonal rules, the maintenance of the individual's experience of continuity in the presence of multiple states of mind, and the capacity to understand the mental states and actions of others. Many of the overarching, metarepresentational functions could also be characterized as functions of the self, and these appear to be disrupted in conditions that are as widely different as schizophrenia and borderline personality disorder. In schizophrenia the monitoring of the individual's own thoughts or actions may be impaired, whilst in borderline functioning the continuity of states of mind is undermined. If the sense of self is derived from the awareness of being the author of one's own actions or thoughts over time, then in these conditions it is undermined in different ways. Inasmuch as the coherence of the self is in turn central to action, disturbances of action are the result of these different forms of disruption of the self.In both condition, further contrasting factors may undermine action. In schizophrenia inefficient information processing may lead either to action based on incidental aspects of a situation, or to inaction based on information overload. In borderline personality disorder experiences in which action has been impossible may lead to action turned on itself, in self injury. However, in both, there may be elements that represent the attempt to preserve action in the face of such threats. In schizophrenia delusions and hallucinations may in part be compensatory mechanisms that reduce uncertainty, hence providing the basis for action. In borderline personality disorder the splitting of mental representations may similarly, by excluding elements that are incompatible with action, provide (partial) representations that provide the basis for action. Thus in both conditions elements of accurate representation are sacrificed, in order for action to continue.Conditions in which action is preserved may be contrasted with those, such as depression, where it is not. In either case a range of intentional and non-intentional origins may be envisaged. In situations of helplessness depression may be seen to be an appropriate and accurate representation that action is not possible. Depression seen in the absence of such threat may result from the intrusion of cognitive and emotional states that undermine action arising from a physical, non-intentional interruption of perceptions, thoughts, feelings, or actions. Equally depression may arise where mental representations that have been maintained inactive or out of consciousness are activated, and are incompatible with action.We conclude by revisiting our starting point. Mental entities, perceptions, feelings, thoughts, and wishes are genuinely causal and must provide sufficient certainty that the individual can act effectively. Throughout biology, intentional states of organisms, from the simplest cellular creatures to non-human primates, have provided the basis for action, and in general the certainty has been derived from the evolution of those intentional states over long periods of time. In this and the preceding chapters we have seen how, in the activities of the human mind there is an infinite elaboration of the potential inherent in all intentional processes in biology. This has introduced novelty, creativity, and flexibility, that are seen in the achievements of language, custom, technology, and culture. It has also increased the risks of uncertainty, confusion, and the undermining of action. These are reduced through an interplay between the sophisticated integrative capacities of the human brain and the continuities of human relationships, skills, beliefs, and social organizations. Disorder is found in the failure of intentional states to underpin action, where these are undermined by the external world, or where intentional states are distorted, contradictory or unintegrated, and where action is undermined or ineffective.",

Generalized anxiety disorder is characterized by persistent, excessive, and unrealistic worry about everyday things. This worry could be multifocal such as finance, family, health, and the future. It is excessive, difficult to control, and is often accompanied by many non-specific psychological and physical symptoms. Excessive worry is the central feature of generalized anxiety disorder.Diagnostic criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-V) include the following: Excessive anxiety and worry for at least six months Difficulty controlling the worrying. The anxiety is associated with three or more of the below symptoms for at least 6 months: Restlessness, feeling keyed up or on edge Being easily fatigued Difficulty in concentrating or mind going blank, irritability Muscle tension Sleep disturbance Irritability The anxiety results in significant distress or impairment in social and occupational areas The anxiety is not attributable to any physical cause",

      "title": "Some Remarks About Somato-Psychic Compared to Psychosomatic Relationships",
      "abstract": "Somato-psychic medicine refers to all those processes in which psychological phenomena are produced by alterations of the body's anatomy or physiology. It is often extremely difficult to determine the first cause of a psychic disturbance, since somatic influences may produce psychic phenomena, and these in turn may produce somatic processes, and vice versa. These relationships are graphically portrayed for a few well-known clinical pictures. At times it is possible, by analysis of the manifestations presented, to discover evidence of the various influences. Under certain conditions, however, a later process may exert such overwhelming effects in the temporal succession of events that the influence of earlier factors may not be manifest in the clinical picture. A simple classification of the various somato-psychic influences in three groups is presented for better visualization. The first group is comprised of processes taking place within the confines of the skull. The second is represented by those disease processes that are anatomically located extracranially but where changed metabolites or other agents exert influence on the brain cells with subsequent psychic signs. Drugs and other substances brought from outside into the body and exerting influence on the brain may be regarded as a subgroup of factors belonging to this second group. The third group comprises psychic processes that represent conscious or unconscious reactions by the individuals to somatic diseases or to permanent bodily conditions. The correlation of somatic abnormalities and psychological disturbance is, of course, not exhausted by psychosomatic and somato-psychic relationships, since a certain body build and a particular psychological make-up may be expressions of the same constitution.",

Bradshaw1, 3 1 Monash University, Centre for Developmental Psychiatry & Psychology, School of Psychology, Psychiatry and Psychological Medicine, Australia 2 University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, United States 3 Monash University, Experimental Neuropsychology Unit, School of Psychology, Psychiatry and Psychological Medicine, Australia Despite early reports of neurological ‘soft’ signs in Williams syndrome (WS), there has not yet been any systematic investigation of the developmental progression of motor dysfunction in this disorder. These individuals are often described as ‘clumsy’, and show poor motor coordination, for instance when walking across uneven surfaces or negotiating obstacles. The few clinical reports of motor problems in WS have described subtle neurologic signs of cerebellar dysfunction such as mild dysmetria and poor balance during cerebellar sensitization tests (tandem walking). However, the precise neuroanatomical loci for the motor impairments seen in WS are as yet unclear, with some evidence that motor impairments resembling basal ganglia dysfunction appear to increase and persist into adulthood. The aim of this study was to systematically examine neuromotor dysfunction in adults with WS, by employing a kinematic analysis of upper-limb and gait function to determine whether the motor profile is consistent with basal ganglia or cerebellar dysfunction. A further aim of the study was to examine the impact of attention and executive deficits on visuomotor 48 performance in WS. The relationship between cognitive function (assessed on standardized tests of attention and executive function) and motor control was explored using visuomotor tasks with varying levels of task difficulty for individuals with WS. Preliminary results suggest a more pervasive functional impairment that involves deficits in movement control when compared to matched controls, implicating frontostriatal deficits in WS. The results will be discussed in the context of the important interaction between higher-level cognitive function and motor control in WS. Further, we speculate about the possible genetic influences on early brain development that may contribute to the visuomotor deficits seen in individuals with WS.

      "title": "Overtraining Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Definitions Functional overreaching (FOR): intensified training results in a temporary decline in performance. When appropriate periods of recovery are provided, a positive \"supercompensation\" effect occurs, with the athlete exhibiting enhanced performance. Nonfunctional overreaching (NFOR): an accumulation of training and/or nontraining stress resulting in short-term decrement in performance capacity with or without related physiological and psychological signs and symptoms of maladaptation in which restoration of performance capacity may take from several days to several weeks. Overtraining syndrome (OTS): same as NFOR, except decrement is long-term and restoration takes several weeks or months. Key point: the difference between NFOR and OTS is the amount of time needed for performance restoration; therefore, the diagnosis of OTS can often only be made retrospectively (3). Pathophysiology Unknown, biochemical/hormonal hypotheses include the following: glycogen depletion, central fatigue/branched chain fatty acid depletion, glutamine depletion/immune dysfunction, autonomic imbalance, oxidative stress, hypothalamic dysregulation, and cytokine release/inflammation (1,2). The mechanism triggering these changes often involves a training error that results in imbalance between energy expenditure load and recovery. This typically occurs in combination with a complex set of psychological factors and environmental stressors (e.g., monotony of training, excessive competitions, sleep disturbances, interpersonal difficulties, academic/occupational stressors, illness, altitude exposure, heat or cold injury, etc.). Epidemiology Most commonly seen in endurance events such as swimming, cycling, or running Prevalence and incidence data for true OTS are lacking; the lifetime prevalence of NFOR/OTS is estimated to be approximately 30% for nonelite endurance athletes and 60% for elite athletes (2,3). Important Differential Diagnoses NFOR/OTS is a diagnosis of exclusion (1). Common: caffeine withdrawal, environmental allergies, exercise-induced bronchospasm, infectious mononucleosis, insufficient sleep, anemia, performance anxiety, inadequate carbohydrate or protein intake, mood disorder, psychosocial stress, upper respiratory infection. Less common: dehydration, diabetes mellitus, eating disorder, hepatitis, hypothyroidism, lower respiratory infection, medication side effect (antidepressant, anxiolytic, antihistamine, β-blocker), post-concussive syndrome, pregnancy, substance abuse. Rare but important: adrenocortical insufficiency or excess, congenital or acquired heart disease, arrhythmia, bacterial endocarditis, congestive heart failure, coronary heart disease, human immunodeficiency virus, malabsorption syndrome, chronic lung disease, Lyme disease, malaria, malignancy, neuromuscular disorder, chronic renal disease, syphilis. Evaluation Thorough history including chief complaint, training program, diet, medications, nutrition, illness, review of systems, and assessment of training goals. Hallmark feature in history: athletes with NFOR/OTS are usually able to start a normal training sequence or a race at their normal pace but are not able to complete the training load they are given or race as usual (3). Initial laboratory examinations: complete blood count, complete metabolic panel, Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate/C-reactive protein, thyroid-stimulating hormone, iron studies, creatine kinase, urinalysis, and beta-human chorionic gonadotropin. Consider monospot, hepatitis panel, Lyme titer, toxicology screen, and chest x-ray. Prescribe absolute rest for 2 wk. ○ If mood is adversely affected with full rest, consider relative rest with well-defined expectations. If improved at follow-up, focus on adjustments to training and prevention (as follows). If no improvement, consider NFOR/OTS: ○ Will require prolonged training rest and further workup ○ Consider consulting with a sports psychologist and nutritionist. ○ Sequence of advancing activity should focus on frequency, then duration, then intensity (1,2). Monitoring Monitor performance in time trials and standard exercise challenges. There are currently no good practical biomarkers for NFOR/OTS (2). Psychiatric indicators may be most useful. Examples include the Profile of Mood States and Recovery-Stress Questionnaire for Athletes (1). A two-bout maximal exercise protocol has shown differences in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal response for athletes with FOR, NFOR, and OTS and may have prognostic value (2). Prevention Considerations for coaches, athletic trainers, and health care providers (2,3): Maintain accurate records of performance and encourage athletes to keep a diary of training load. Emphasize adequate rest and \"time out\" periods when performance declines, when an athlete complains of fatigue, or after illness or injury. Individualize and supervise training program. Avoid monotony of training. Encourage and reinforce optimal nutrition, hydration, and sleep. Be aware of life stressors, and communicate with athletes about physical, mental, and emotional concerns. Consider regular psychological questionnaires. Schedule regular health checks with a multidisciplinary team.",

The majority of sleep-related movement disorders is represented by benign conditions which have no known adverse effects on health. Many of these disorders include muscular jerking of the torso or legs. Some disorders consist of repetitive movement of the legs. The severity of each of these disorders varies greatly and, in severe forms, the sleep-related movement disorders can result in sleep disruption and daytime sleepiness. Importantly, similar movements can arise from disease of muscle, nerve, spinal cord or even brain, so if movement is frequent or severe, it is best to consult a health care professional.",

Children with conduct disorders, with or without attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, have an elevated risk for antisocial or psychopathic personality disorders in adolescence and adulthood. The presence of comorbid disorders such as substance abuse and schizophrenia have a strong negative predictive value with respect to the course, the prognosis, and the outcome of antisocial and psychopathic disorders. Furthermore, there are substantial gender differences. The rates for spontaneous remission and improvement of antisocial and psychopathic personality disorders are possibly relatively high.

It can develop as a result of traumatic events such as exposure to violence, a vehicle accident, a fire, a medical procedure, a natural disaster, etc. Symptoms must last for more than a month and cause clinically significant distress or impairment of social, occupational, or other important life areas. This chapter briefly presents usual treatments for PTSD, explains how chronic pain is one of the common health problems associated with PTSD, and summarises the existing treatments of chronic pain associated to PTSD. Among those treatments, the reader will find cognitive-behavioral techniques, Levine's somatic experiencing approach, eye movement desensitization and reprocessing, and hypnosis.",

      "abstract": "SLE (systemic lupus erythematosus) is a multisystem autoimmune disorder of unknown aetiology which can present with myriad clinical presentation. The neurological manifestations of SLE consist of central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system manifestations (PNS). The CNS manifestations are aseptic meningitis, cerebrovascular accidents (stroke), demyelinating disorders, headache, involuntary movements like chorea, myelopathy, acute confusional states, cognitive dysfunction, mood disorder, seizures, psychosis and cranial nerve palsies.1 The PNS manifestations are Guillain Barre syndrome (GBS), autonomic disorder, mononeuropathy, polyneuropathy and plexopathy.1 Neuropathy in SLE can be clinically classified as mononeuritis multiplex and symmetrical and asymmetrical polyneuropathy. Symmetrical polyneuropathy being the most commonly seen clinical entity amongst the neuropathies in SLE. The neuropathy can be slowly progressive or acute in onset. Electrophysiologically, neuropathy is classified as axonal neuropathy, small fibre neuropathy, demyelinating neuropathy, mixed axonal-demyelinating sensorimotor polyneuropathy and plexopathy. Axonal neuropathy is further divided into sensory, sensorimotor and mononeuritis multiplex. Demyelinating neuropathy can be of two types: acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP) and sensory demyelinating polyneuropathy. Anecdotal case reports also suggest that CIDP can occur as part of SLE neuropathy.2.",

      "abstract": "Psychiatric rehabilitation of the chronically mentally ill requires conceptual distinction among psychological abnormalities of the nervous system, representing active pathology or a disease state; impairment of functions by means of which those abnormalities can be inferred; disabilities, i.e., losses of functional ability consequent upon an impairment; and handicaps, which are the social disadvantages resulting from disability [1-3]. These various levels of functioning cannot be separated from the environment. Socioenvironmental stressors, defined by Mechanic [4] as a discrepancy between demands presented to a person and his or her capacity to deal with them, influence the appearance of impairments, disabilities, and handicaps. Wing [5] lists three factors that can cause and exacerbate social disablement in cases of frequent relapse or chronic impairment: environmental overstimulation or understimulation, social disadvantage, and adverse personal reactions (secondary disablement) caused by acceptance by the handicapped person of limitations that are not actually necessary. It is clear that assessment and evaluation of impairments are important in avoiding understimulation and overstimulation and preventing or correcting adverse personal reactions. Although premorbid and environmental factors play an important role, we can expect the more severely impaired also to be the more severely disabled. Patients with schizophrenia are especially subject to",

La conducta se puede presentar eventualmente en padecimientos psiquiatricos como estados depresivos o psicoticos. Sin embargo, cuando se presenta de manera frecuente, constituye lo que se denomina el sindrome de autolesion deliberada que se puede observar en pacientes con retraso mental y trastornos de personalidad. Este trabajo sustenta una implicacion de las estructuras limbicas que procesan el componente cognoscitivo-afectivo del dolor en el desarrollo del comportamiento autolesivo (CAL). Proponemos que el CAL resulta de una disfuncion en la percepcion nociceptiva, particularmente en los mecanismos de alto orden de procesamiento, donde se integra el dolor como una experiencia consciente y se conceptua como sensacion desagradable. Suponemos que esta alteracion en la percepcion nociceptiva puede considerarse como una consecuencia, manifestacion o sintoma, de una anomalia en la percepcion de si mismo. La alteracion en la percepcion nociceptiva y en la percepcion de si mismo, resultaria, en algunos casos, de la incidencia de factores ambientales desfavorables en personas biologicamente vulnerables, mientras que en otros, seria la anomalia biologica la determinante de la conducta. Se ha encontrado una asociacion entre la incapacidad de reconocer estimulos nociceptivos y la presencia de fenomenos disociativos. Esto ejemplifica la forma en que una respuesta altamente especializada y adaptativa en sujetos sanos ante condiciones amenazantes podria originar, de manera paradojica, conductas poco adaptativas. Los sujetos expuestos de manera cronica a situaciones amenazantes en edades tempranas, son susceptibles de desarrollar un patron de respuesta patologico que podria poner en riesgo su vida.",

Methods: Data from more than 250 articles and books were reviewed, as well as data obtained by the authors from their extensive clinical experience in treating self-mutilating patients. Results and conclusions: The diverse behaviors that constitute pathological self-mutilation can be categorized into three basic types: major-infrequent acts that result in significant tissue damage, usually associated with psychoses and acute intoxications; stereotypic-fixed, rhythmic behavior seemingly devoid of symbolism, commonly associated with mental retardation; and superficial or moderate-behavior such as skin cutting, burning, and scratching associated with a variety of mental disorders. The authors propose that a syndrome of repetitive superficial or moderate self-mutilation should be regarded as an axis I impulse disorder. In most cases, the syndrome coexists with character pathology.",

      "title": "‘Honour the real thing’: Shakespeare, Trauma and <i>Titus Andronicus</i> in South Africa",
      "abstract": "The turn to the traumatic has gained considerable currency in a range of humanities’ disciplines over the last fifteen years, alongside an increased popular usage of the term following the inclusion of Post-traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders of the American Psychiatric Association in 1980. Trauma, which derives from the Greek τραύμα, literally meaning ‘wound’, denotes both a ‘wound, or external bodily injury in general’ (OED 1), and, in the context of developments in psychoanalysis and psychiatry, it emerges in the late nineteenth century as a ‘psychic injury, esp. one caused by emotional shock the memory of which is repressed and remains unhealed; an internal injury, esp. to the brain, which may result in a behavioural disorder of organic origin’ (OED 2a). The shift to the realm of the psychic, which can be traced through the work of John Erichsen, Jean-Martin Charcot, Sigmund Freud, Josef Breuer and, more recently, Dominick LaCapra, Cathy Caruth, Kirby Farrell, Ruth Leys and Ann Cvetkovich, among others, retains the language of the wound and injury but variously associates it with both behavioural responses to physical injury and, crucially for this article and work in the humanities, to ‘emotional shock’, the effects of which are still being felt. As Caruth summarizes, ‘trauma is described as the response to an unexpected or overwhelming violent event or events that are not fully grasped as they occur, but return later in repeated flashbacks, nightmares, and other repetitive phenomena’. She goes on to argue that this opens a paradox in the traumatic experience: ‘that the most direct seeing of a violent event may occur as an absolute inability to know it; that immediacy, paradoxically, may take the form of belatedness’.",

      "abstract": "A disartria e uma desordem da fala decorrente de comprometimentos neuromusculares. Tais comprometimentos podem causar alteracoes na respiracao, na fonacao, na ressonância e na articulacao da fala. Estes comprometimentos podem ser decorrentes de traumatismo craniano (TC). O TC e uma agressao cerebral resultante de uma pancada na cabeca e/ou uma queda com fratura craniana. Na fala disartrica pode haver, tambem, falha no mecanismo velofaringeo devido a paralisia/paresia do palato mole. Neste caso, o resultado acustico para a fala e a hipernasalidade e a emissao de ar nasal, que podem ser tratadas atraves do uso de uma protese de palato elevadora (PPE). Na disartria, o ritmo da fala tambem pode estar alterado, implicando alteracoes nos locais de acento frasal (AF), na insercao e na duracao das pausas silenciosas (PS). Sendo assim, interessou-nos investigar a estruturacao ritmica da fala disartrica decorrente de TC. Para tanto, obtivemos a colaboracao de uma falante disartrica, usuaria de PPE, falante nativa do portugues brasileiro (PB) acometida por TC. O estudo desta fala isartrica teve como objetivos: comparar as condicoes de uso e nao uso da PPE; comparar a estruturacao ritmica da fala disartrica brasileira (FDB) com uma fala sem comprometimentos (FSC); comparar a estruturacao ritmica da FDB com uma fala isartrica francesa (FDF); estudar a relacao sintaxeprosodia na estruturacao ritmica da fala tanto na comparacao com a FSC quanto na comparacao com a FDF; adquirir melhor entendimento da fala disartrica pos TC, considerando o modelo de ritmo da fala para o PB de Barbosa (2006). Para cumprir estes objetivos, acompanhamos o tratamento com PPE da falante disartrica de 1995 a 2005. Neste periodo coletamos e analisamos oito leituras de um mesmo texto realizadas por ela usando a PPE e duas leituras sem esta protese: uma em 1995 e outra em 2005. A FSC correspondeu a leitura do mesmo texto da FDB. A FDF correspondeu a leitura de outro texto frances. Nestas leituras realizamos analises acusticas e de sua organizacao ritmica em unidades vogal-vogal (VV), grupos acentuais (GA), AF e PS. Nas analises das oito leituras da FDB houve reducao no numero de PS, reducao da participacao das PS na duracao do texto lido e aumento da taxa de elocucao (TE). A estruturacao ritmica da FDB com e sem a protese foi a mesma. Houve diferenca significante entre a FDB e a FSC para a TE e para a duracao das PS, mas nao para a duracao dos GA nem para o numero de unidades VV. Na comparacao entre a FDB e a FDF nao houve diferencas significativas quanto a TE, taxa de articulacao e numero de unidades VV por GA. Na relacao sintaxe-prosodia, as marcas sintaticas IDF (independencia forte) e COORD (independencia de uma conjuncao coordenada) foram significativas tanto para a FDB quanto para a FSC. Mas nao para a FDF. Nosso trabalho contribuiu para destacar a pertinencia de estudos que considerem a relacao dinâmica entre fatores biomecânicos e linguisticos da fala, notadamente para a fala comprometida e, em especial, para a fala disartrica pos TC \r\nAbstract",

It is a neurologic emergency requiring immediate evaluation and treatment. The traditional definition of GCSE requires continuous, repetitive seizure activity for at least 30 min, or two or more discrete seizures within a 30-min period without recovery of consciousness between attacks. The temporal marker of 30 min is arbitrary and not based on physiologic or clinical data (2). Several epileptologists have proposed a \"mechanistic\" definition of GCSE: Most seizures stop spontaneously in 1 or 2 min; therefore, longer seizures generally reflect a problem with the usual mechanisms of seizure termination. The \"mechanistic\" definition refers to any seizure that will not terminate spontaneously, consisting of convulsive movements and loss of consciousness (3,4). This definition, however, is not practical for clinical and research purposes because there is presently no clear way to distinguish a seizure that will terminate on its own from one that will not. An \"operational\" definition of GCSE must still be described in terms of time (4).",

A distonia psicogênica caracteriza-se pela inconsistência dos achados, presença de fatores precipitantes, manifestar-se inicialmente nos membros inferiores, associar-se a dor, a outros movimentos anormais incaracterísticos e a somatizações múltiplas. Descrevemos duas pacientes com diagnóstico de distonia psicogênica clinicamente estabelecida. Paciente 1, feminina, apresentou episódio súbito de perda de força dos quatro membros, evoluiu com distonia nos pés, laterocolo alternante, tremor generalizado, irregular, e hipertonia dos membros inferiores que desapareciam a distração; a avaliação psicológica evidenciou depressão, hipocondria, transtorno obsessivo. Paciente 2, feminina, há nove anos começou a ter tremor irregular nos membros inferiores, que desaparecia com a distração, e distonia no pé esquerdo associada a dor; progressivamente perdeu a marcha; a avaliação psicológica revelou comportamento infantilizado, com baixa tolerância a frustração, impulsividade e auto-agressão. Os exames complementares de ambas não mostraram alterações e a resposta ao tratamento farmacológico foi nula. Distonia raramente é de origem psicogênica. A inconstância e a incongruência com o quadro clássico, associadas a outras somatizações ou a distúrbios psiquiátricos, sugerem o diagnóstico.",

Pharmacological studies suggest that the tics of GTS result from dysfunction of monoaminergic systems, more specifically from increased dopaminergic activity due to postsynaptic dopamine receptor supersensitivity. However, given that striatal dopaminergic and cholinergic systems exhibit reciprocal antagonism in other movement disorders such as Parkinsonism and chorea, it is conceivable that the cholinergic system is implicated in the disease. In the present communication it is proposed that: (a) the emergence of motor and vocal tics in GTS is associated with increased centra] cholinergic activity; (b) cholinergic overactivity is involved in the manifestation of other symptoms in GTS including depression, sleep disorders, motion sickness, pain, sensory tics, and the waxing and waning course of the disease; (c) abnormalities of the cholinergic system support previous evidence linking GTS with delayed cerebral maturation in a subset of young patients; and (d) drugs which stimulate cholinergic receptors may exacerbate symptoms of GTS, and as with dopamine agonists, should be avoided in patients with GTS.",

      "abstract": "Executive functions and response rapidity are frequently impaired in stroke patients and they represent a core deficit of post-stroke disability. The determinants of these deficits include several factors, the most classical of which is the site of the lesion. \"Executive functions and deficits\" encompass a large number of processes and impairments, and this terminology has been used with various meanings. Most frequently, executive functions refer to more central functions that control other abilities, and are most detectable in non-routine situations such as novel, conflicting, or complex tasks. The terminology \"executive functions\" (and dysexecutive syndrome) is now frequently preferred to \"frontal functions\" (and frontal syndrome) (although perhaps best instantiated in these anatomical areas) because these functions may also be impaired by non-frontal lesions. Disorders commonly considered to be \"executive\" in origin include a large number of behavioral changes and cognitive deficits. In addition, there is a huge overlap with some attentional processes such as selective, divided, and sustained attention (hence the term \"supervisory attentional system\") and these aspects are included in this review. Several reviews have covered this rapidly evolving field (Roberts et al., 1996; Stuss and Alexander 2000; Godefroy, 2003). This review reports recent approaches to the dysexecutive syndrome from a clinical perspective. Several classes of executive disorders have been described and they can be roughly divided into behavioral and cognitive domains (Eslinger and Damasio, 1985; Bechara et al., 1998).",

      "abstract": "Although there are several studies revealing the role of impulsivity in mental disorders, debates in the literature about how to define and determine impulsivity continue. Being a measurable feature of behaviour, impulsivity is defined as the failure to resist a drive or stimulus or as a personality dimension as the inability to resist the desire to harm one's self or others. Besides this negative definition, however, impulsivity is also defined as independent dysfunctional and functional concepts having both positive and negative consequences. It can be a psychopathological structural part of many mental disorders, but it can be a characteristic of normal behaviour as well. Although not defined in detail in DSM-IV, it is mentioned as a diagnostic criterion in several mental disorders like impulse control disorders (pathological gambling, intermittent explosive disorder, pyromania, kleptomania and trichotillomania), impulsive aggressive disorders of personality (borderline, antisocial, histrionic and narcissistic), manic episodes of bipolar disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), neurological disorders with behavioural disinhibition and substance abuse. Studies have revealed impulsivity to be more common in subjects with conduct disorders, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, disorders of personality, substance and alcohol abuse, psychotic disorders, bipolar disorders, eating disorders and dementia compared to healthy subjects in control groups. The aim of the present paper is to define impulsivity as a concept and symptom, to discuss its relation to mental disorders, to show the biological basis of this relationship and to review the literature relating to this issue.",

Forensic Neuropsychology establishes an expert valuation of the brain-injured patient (or supposed), or of the law offender people (or supposed) requiring law protection due to their illness. This discipline has a fundamental role in the study of cerebral organic syndromes, particularly in the dementias. DEVELOPMENT. The demential syndrome is common to a group of diseases as degenerative or cardiovascular disorders, brain tumors, syphilis, alcoholism or toxic factors, etc. When speaking of dementia we refer to a syndrome characterized by a progressive and global deterioration of the cognitive functions (memory, language, attention, space-temporal orientation, praxis, thinking, etc.) with preservation of the level of conscience (DSM-IV). This symptomatology affects the personality of the individual as reasonable being , as well as to his behavior and social adaptation. The decrease or loss of the intellectual and volitives abilities of the affected person of a demential syndrome, if it is permanent, also implies a change in its legal situation, since its legal capacity is altered. Therefore, it will be necessary to adopt protective measures for his person and his patrimony. Even if it is necessary, to promote a process of disability, whose sentence will be emitted by a judge, who will indicate: the degree of the mentioned disability, the trusteeship regime and who is designated as a legal tutor.",

      "abstract": "Neurotrauma means head or spine injury caused by an external force. Neurotraumatology care requires coordinated teamwork on the part of specialists, including psychological care as part of the multidisciplinary treatment team. Psychological interventions in the field of neurotraumatology aim to address the psychological consequences and challenges associated with head or spine injury. These interventions play a vital role in crisis intervention, promoting recovery, enhancing quality of life, and supporting individuals and their families in coping with the psychological impact of neurotrauma. Serious physical injuries always cause severe psychological consequences, both in short and long term. A critical accident is a sudden, unexpected, often directly life-threatening event that exceeds the individual's ability to respond and can create a potential crisis response, including suicidal risk, as well as the development of psychological disorders, in most cases acute stress disorder, adjustment disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. Psychological interventions in neurotraumatology are often provided by a multidisciplinary team that may include psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, and other healthcare professionals. These interventions are tailored to the unique needs and circumstances of each individual, with the goal of reducing psychological symptomps, promoting psychological well-being, adjustment, and overall recovery following neurotrauma. It is essential that not only patients who have experienced severe physical trauma, but also their family members have access to expert psychological support. This study summarizes psychological interventions during the treatment of neurotaruma patients at the intensive care unit.",

Representative peripheral vertigo disorders include benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, Ménière disease, and vestibular neuritis. Vestibular neuritis, also known as vestibular neuronitis, is the third most common peripheral vestibular disorder after benign paroxysmal positional vertigo and Ménière disease. The cause of vestibular neuritis remains unclear. However, a viral infection of the vestibular nerve or ischemia of the anterior vestibular artery is known to cause vestibular neuritis. In addition, recent studies on immune-mediated mechanisms as the cause of vestibular neuritis have been reported. The characteristic clinical features of vestibular neuritis are abrupt true-whirling vertigo lasting for more than 24 hours, and no presence of cochlear symptoms and other neurological symptoms and signs. To accurately diagnose vestibular neuritis, various diagnostic tests such as the head impulse test, bithermal caloric test, and vestibular-evoked myogenic potential test are conducted. Various treatments for vestibular neuritis have been reported, which are largely divided into symptomatic therapy, specific drug therapy, and vestibular rehabilitation therapy. Symptomatic therapies include generalized supportive care and administration of vestibular suppressants and antiemetics. Specific drug therapies include steroid therapy, antiviral therapy, and vasodilator therapy. Vestibular rehabilitation therapies include generalized vestibular and customized vestibular exercises.",

      "title": "Neuroimaging and Outcome Assessment in Vegetative and Minimally Conscious State",
      "abstract": "Consciousness is a multifaceted concept that has two dimensions: arousal, or wakefulness (i.e., level of consciousness), and awareness (i.e., content of consciousness) (Laureys et al., 2004).An accurate and reliable assessment of the arousal and awareness of consciousness in patients with severe brain damage is of greatest importance for the differential diagnosis of low levels consciousness patients and for outcome evaluation.Following coma, some patients permanently lose all brainstem function (brain death), some progress to \"wakeful unawareness\" (vegetative state -VS), whereas others recover typically and progress through different stages before fully or partly recovering consciousness (minimally conscious state -MCS).Patients in VS can open their eyes and exhibit basic orienting responses, but show no conscious, purposeful activity.Reflex and other movements are seen, mediated by brainstem, spinal cord, and brainstem-diencephalic arousal systems (Laureys et al., 2004).VS can occur after patients emerge from an acute catastrophic brain insult causing coma, or can also be seen in degenerative or congenital nervous system disorders.The two common findings are necrosis of the cerebral cortex, thalamus and brainstem (usually after anoxic injury) and diffuse axonal injury (usually after trauma), although other pathological findings can be seen in degenerative and other disorders (Laureys, 2008).The MCS patients do not meet diagnostic criteria for coma or VS because they demonstrate some inconsistent but clear evidence of consciousness (Laureys et al., 2008;Giacino et al., 2002).In the MCS, there is variable impaired function of the cerebral cortex, diencephalons and upper brainstem.This allows occasional conscious behaviours to occur, unlike in VS or coma.Patients may enter the MCS as they emerge from coma or VS, or they can become minimally conscious as a result of acute injury or chronic degenerative diseases.Recent studies suggest a number of potential clinical and rehabilitative applications of magnetic resonance (MR) techniques.Although bedside clinical examination remains the criterion standard for establishing diagnosis, MR may provide an adjunctive diagnostic role when behavioural findings are very limited or ambiguous.The future of diagnostic and prognostic assessment of patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC) envisions a battery of neurobehavioral and neuroimaging techniques (such as structural and functional MR imaging (MRI and www.intechopen.comNeuroimaging -Cognitive and Clinical Neuroscience 182 fMRI), MR spectroscopy (MRS), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), fiber tracking, positron emission tomography (PET)) that serve as complementary clinical tools that may help differentiate the effects of underarousal, sensory impairment, motor dysfunction, and cognitive disturbance in the search for potential causes of behavioural unresponsiveness. Magnetic Resonance and Magnetization Transfer ImagingThe morphological MRI acquisitions usually include non-contrast-enhanced sagittal T1, axial diffusion, axial fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), axial T2-SE, coronal T2 sequences and a 3D T1-weighted volume acquisition.FLAIR and T2-SE sequences permit to detect brain edema, contusion, hematoma, herniation, subarachnoid hemorrhage, or hydrocephalus.T2 sequences are useful in detecting hemorrhagic diffuse axonal injuries (DAI).The total number of lesions detected by FLAIR and T2 are shown to be inversely correlated with Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) of traumatic coma patients; while the 3D T1 sequence provides an opportunity to evaluate the brain atrophy during the follow up of these patients.A lot of studies performed on traumatic coma patients with conventional MRI showed that lesions of the pons, midbrain, and basal ganglia were predictive of poor outcome especially when they are bilateral.Despite their encouraging results, these studies fail to explain why some patients in VS or with long-term marked cognitive impairments have no or minimal lesions on conventional MRI examination.This raises the question of the lack of specificity and insufficient sensitivity of conventional MR sequences which fail to reveal lesions such as ischemic axonal injuries.Therefore, it is clear that morphological and conventional MRI alone cannot be considered as a reliable tool to assess consciousness disorders severity or to predict their evolution and outcome (Tshibanda et al., 2009).Several studies investigated patients in VS and in MCS using non-conventional, quantitative and volumetric MR techniques, useful to provide information about the anatomical patterns, the prognosis and the outcome of these patients.Ammermann et al. (2007) have used volumetric analysis of MRI to determine the pattern of lesions in 12 patients with a severe neurological impairment after acute ischemic injury.At the time of scanning, the patients were either in VS or in an early remising state, that is MCS.Lesions were classified as having been present in the gray and/or white matter in four different brain regions (frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital).An additional separate evaluation was performed for the basal ganglia, thalamus, hippocampus, cerebellum, and brainstem.The total clinical follow-up period of all patients from the time of the causative event lasted for at least 5 months.The clinical outcomes were reported according to the Rancho Los Amigos Cognitive Scale (RLACS) as a universal guide to assess a patient's level of functioning.The final RLACS levels were correlated to the MRI lesion size with a Spearman correlation.All patients demonstrated extensive white matter lesions, with the largest lesions observed in the frontal and occipital lobe.A preferential involvement of the white matter located in the periventricular area and in the subcortical regions below the motor and internal temporal cortices was found, in addition to the classifically described lesions of the striatum, motor and occipital cortices.Lesion magnitude showed an association with the severity of the outcome as quantitatively assessed by RLACS.With respect to gray matter lesions, the vulnerability pattern observed included frontal and occipital and in some cases parietal cortical areas, moreover in most cases the thalamus.Additionally, almost all of patients showed lesions of the hippocampus or lesions to the basal ganglia.An association between the extent of the MRI defined lesions located within the white matter and the clinical www.intechopen.comNeuroimaging and Outcome Assessment in Vegetative and Minimally Conscious State 183 outcomes of the patients was found.All patients in the most unfavorable class III clinical outcome group (i.e.persistent VS) exhibited white matter lesions exceeding 2/3 of the volume of at least one lobe, most frequently the occipital lobe.Moreover, Juengling et al. ( 2005) investigated 5 patients in persistent VS due to prolonged cerebral hypoxia of non-traumatic origin, using combined Voxel-Based Morphometry (VBM) of 3D MRI and FDG-PET analysis.In the analysis of the regional distribution of gray matter atrophy, VBM revealed multiple areas of significantly decreased gray matter density at p<.001, corrected for multiple comparisons.Those were localized in multiple cortical areas, in particular including inferior parietal lobe, superior and medial frontal lobe, paracentral lobule, superior and medial temporal lobe, the cingulum, and the fusiform gyrus.Thalamic changes were limited to small voxel clusters in dorso-medial areas.These structural atrophic changes were compared with the local distribution of functional loss as assessed by regional hypometabolism in the FDG-PET group analysis.At the threshold pb0.001 (corrected for multiple comparisons), PET showed a widespread pattern of hypometabolic areas.In particular, the parietal and frontotemporal cortices, the cuneus/precuneus, the cingulum, the frontal medial and precentral gyrus, and the transverse temporal gyrus were involved, additionally the bilateral thalamus (mainly dorsomedial subnucleus).All changes were, similar to the VBM results, nearly symmetrical.Improved understanding of this complex lesion pattern gained by in vivo group analyses like here might help to provide deeper insights into the general pathoanatomy of patients in the persistent VS.Using high-resolution T1-weighted magnetic resonance images and a novel approach to shape analysis applied SIENAX software, Fernandez-Espejo et al. ( 2010) investigated thalamic global and regional changes in a sample of patients in a VS or an MCS.They found that total thalamic volume was significantly lower in patients than in healthy volunteers.Shape analysis revealed significant bilateral regional atrophy in the dorso-medial body in patients compared to controls; this atrophy was more widespread in VS than in MCS patients.Lower thalamic volume was significantly correlated with worsening of Disability Rating Scale (DRS) scores.Shape analysis suggested that the dorso-medial nucleus and the internal medullar lamina were the main regions responsible for this correlation.These findings suggest that MCS and VS patients present different patterns of regional thalamic abnormalities.In particular, VS patients showed a more widespread pattern of atrophy than controls, producing differences in global thalamic volume.MCS patients did not show volumetric differences compared to controls, and regionally they showed a less pronounced inward collapse in both the dorsal and ventral areas, with the anterior-ventral body significantly spared.Neuropathological studies have demonstrated that thalamic damage is less common in MCS than in VS patients (Jennett et al., 2001).Another quantitative RM technique is the Magnetization Transfer Imaging (MTI).The MTI relies on the principle that protons bound in structures exhibit T1 relaxation coupling with protons in the aqueous phase.When an off-resonance saturation pulse is applied, it selectively saturates those protons that are bound in macromolecules.These protons subsequently exchange longitudinal magnetization with free water protons, leading to a reduction in the detected signal intensity (Sinson et al., 2001).The MTI may provide a quantitative index of the structural integrity of tissue and might be useful to study the outcome of patients with low levels of consciousness.However, further studies, on larger groups of patients, need to be performed to confirm the usefulness of quantitative MRI in the assessment of the eventual neurological prognosis and outcome of these challenging patients.",

      "abstract": "La propriocezione rappresenta la capacita del sistema nervoso centrale di percepire la posizione e il movimento nello spazio del corpo e delle sue parti, ed e importantissima sia per un meccanismo di controllo sulla corretta esecuzione del movimento, sia per un meccanismo di eventuale correzione nel caso in cui imprevedibili fenomeni esterni vengano a turbare i progetti motori strategicamente programmati. La propriocezione assume quindi un'importanza fondamentale nel complesso sistema dell'equilibrio e del movimento. Molteplici malattie e traumi possono compromettere il sistema propriocettivo e di conseguenza le risposte motorie potrebbero non essere piu adeguate.\r\nLo scopo della tesi e ricercare nella letteratura scientifica le tecniche di valutazione della propriocezione e la relazione tra questa, il cammino e la postura dal punto di vista biomeccanico. L’analisi critica degli studi esaminati ha messo in evidenza che, a seconda della zona celebrale colpita da una malattia che lede il sistema nervoso, la propriocezione puo risultare o meno compromessa e non sempre i disturbi del cammino e della postura sono causati da deficit propriocettivi. Al contrario, traumi o lesioni ai propriocettori sono sempre associati casi d’instabilita e difficolta motoria. In questi casi tuttavia la propriocezione risulta essere un fattore modificabile la cui efficacia puo essere stimolata tramite esercizi mirati o stimolazioni esterne. Diversi metodi di valutazione della propriocezione sono stati utilizzati; non esiste tuttavia una tecnica di misurazione standard che descrive l’abilita funzionale generale",

      "title": "The Role of Controlled Exercise in Concussion Management",
      "abstract": "Abstract Concussion affects the autonomic nervous system and its control of cerebral blood flow, which may be why uncontrolled activity can exacerbate symptoms after concussion. Traditionally, patients have been advised to restrict physical and cognitive activity until all symptoms resolve. However, recent research suggests that prolonged rest beyond the first couple of days after a concussion might hinder rather than aid recovery. Humans do not respond well to removal from their social and physical environments, and sustained rest adversely affects the physiology of concussion and can lead to physical deconditioning and reactive depression. Some animal data show that early forced exercise is detrimental to recovery after concussion, but other animal data show that voluntary exercise is not detrimental to recovery. We developed the Buffalo Concussion Treadmill Test to systematically evaluate exercise tolerance in persons with prolonged symptoms after concussion (ie, more than 4‐6 weeks, which is called postconcussion syndrome [PCS]). Using a predetermined stopping criterion (symptom‐exacerbation threshold), akin to voluntary exercise in animals, the Buffalo Concussion Treadmill Test is the only functional test known to safely and reliably reveal exercise intolerance in humans with PCS. The test data are used to develop individualized subthreshold exercise treatment programs to restore the physiology to normal and enhance recovery. Return of normal exercise tolerance can then be used to establish physiological recovery from concussion. New research suggests that absolute rest beyond the first few days after concussion may be detrimental to concussion recovery. However, further research is required to determine the appropriate mode, duration, intensity, and frequency of exercise during the acute recovery phase of a concussion prior to making specific exercise recommendations. For patients with PCS, subsymptom threshold exercise improves activity tolerance and is an appropriate treatment option for this patient population.",

      "title": "The Effects of Electrical Stimulation on Gross Motor Function in Children with Spastic Cerebral Palsy: A Review Article",
      "abstract": "Cerebral Palsy (CP) is the most common childhood disability in children. The child’s motor development and functioning are affected by variety neuromuscular and musculoskeletal impairments. Both of upper and lower extremities motor function are important for many daily life activities. For example, children who has good fine motor function and who can sitting independently can manipulate the objects by using upper extremities and can realize transfer activities. Therefore, she/he can play effectively in daily life. Children who can play will be happy and independent in daily life activities. Spasticity is the most common problem in children with CP and can interfere with daily life activities. Children who have spastic CP constrained in daily life activity, participation and recreational activities. Working on gross motor skills helps to gain strength, increase postural control, to achieve motor milestones and to become independent in daily life activities. In treatment program, physical therapist used different approach, like, exercise programs (stretching, strengthening, aerobic exercise…), electrical stimulation, neurodevelopmental approaches, virtual reality, constrained induced movement therapy. Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation, Functional Electrical Stimulation and Threshold Electrical Stimulation commonly used for this reason. There is a few evidence on positive effects of electrical stimulation applied in children with CP. This review study was planned to investigate the effects of electrical stimulation on gross motor function in children with CP.",

In this chapter, we provide a description of the gross motor disorders, the fine motor disorders, and the more complex disorders associated with the motor system, i.e., sensorimotor disorders and the apraxias. The motor system was described in Chapter 3.Cerebral palsy (CP) is a general term referring to the full variety of motor disorders after lesions at any level of motor control except those secondary to mental retardation or caused by progressive diseases. Anoxic episodes (Chapter 17) and prematurity (Chapter 13) are important considerations. A first description was published by Little (1862, Denhoff and Robinault 1960), whose paper led to general acceptance of the origin of the disorder (also described as Little’s disease). Although the term originally referred only to disorders of the cerebrum, lesions at other levels are frequently included. Since the cause and type of impairment are not specified in the term, it is currently used only in the generic sense. A division into pyramidal (spastic), extrapyramidal (rigid, athetoid, or ataxic), mixed, and dystonic type of CP is frequently made.",

Psychische Wirkungen sind unter anderem eine allgemeine Enthemmung, eine erhoehte Reizbarkeit bis zur Aggressivitaet und eine Einschraenkung des Kritikvermoegens. Physische Wirkungen betreffen das Sehvermoegen, das Hoervermoegen, die Reaktion und das Kleinhirn, was sich in Gleichgewichts- und Bewegungsstoerungen aeussert. Alkoholwirkungen sind in hohem Masse von der Alkoholgewoehnung und der Gesamtbefindlichkeit abhaengig. Generell wirkt Ethanol auf das Zentralnervensystem daempfend. Unter Alkoholeinfluss sind gehaeuft Fahrfehler wie Schlangenlinienfahren, Geradeausfahren in Kurven, Auffahren auf stehende Fahrzeuge oder Hindernisse und inadaequate und Fehlreaktionen auf ueberraschende und komplexere Verkehrssituationen zu beobachten. Alkoholische Rauschzustaende koennen als einfacher, atypischer und pathologischer Rausch klassifiziert werden.

Die Hoehe einer Blutalkoholkonzentration (BAK) ist aus rechtsmedizinischer Sicht nicht per se entscheidend. Insgesamt soll beurteilt werden, ob zur Tatzeit eine relevante psychische Beeintraechtigung durch Alkohol vorgelegen ist.

Three clinical examples are presented in which PRU appears as: (1) malingering; (2) an upper motor lesion inducing spastic closure of the bladder neck, and (3) an alteration of the sensory input, closely resembling sensory neuron damage. The urologist becomes involved in the treatment of these patients by the natural expression of the symptoms. The underlying psychogenic factor does not become evident until urodynamic investigations and often specific therapeutic steps have been undertaken. The urologic treatment sometimes appears helpful because the patients do not realise or refuse to accept the idea of a psychogenic cause and expect relief from the urologist. The latter should withdraw his involvement as soon as an organic cause has been excluded.",

      "title": "Hereditary Neuropathy with Liability to Pressure Palsies",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is characterized by recurrent acute sensory and motor neuropathy in a single or multiple nerves. The most common initial manifestation is the acute onset of a non-painful focal sensory and motor neuropathy in a single nerve (mononeuropathy). The first attack usually occurs in the second or third decade but earlier onset is possible. Neuropathic pain is increasingly recognized as a common manifestation. Recovery from acute neuropathy is usually complete; when recovery is not complete, the resulting disability is mild. Some affected individuals also demonstrate a mild-to-moderate peripheral neuropathy. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of HNPP is established in a proband with suggestive clinical and electrophysiologic findings and either the 1.5-Mb recurrent deletion or a novel deletion involving PMP22 (in 80%), or a PMP22 sequence variant (in 20%) identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is symptomatic and involves occupational therapy and physical therapy as needed to address issues with fine motor and gross motor skills, including activities of daily living. Bracing, such as with a wrist splint or ankle-foot orthosis, may be useful transiently or in some instances permanently. Special shoes, including those with good ankle support, may be needed. Neuropathic pain can be treated with analgesic medications. Protective pads at elbows or knees may prevent pressure and trauma to local nerves. Surveillance: Routine screening neurologic examination focused on muscle atrophy, strength, sensory loss, and neuropathic pain; physical and occupational therapy assessments of gross motor and fine motor skills and activities of daily living; foot examinations for pressure sores or poorly fitting footwear. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Prolonged sitting with legs crossed; prolonged leaning on elbows; occupations requiring repetitive movements of the wrist; rapid weight loss; vincristine. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Asymptomatic relatives at risk may wish to clarify their genetic status by undergoing molecular genetic testing for the PMP22 pathogenic variant identified in an affected family member in order to be advised about agents and circumstances to avoid. Genetic counseling HNPP is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Approximately 20% of individuals with HNPP have the disorder as the result of a de novo PMP22 pathogenic variant. Each child of an affected individual is at a 50% risk of inheriting the PMP22 pathogenic variant. Once the PMP22 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

      "title": "M6. REDUCED READINESS POTENTIAL AS A NEUROPHYSIOLOGICAL CORRELATE OF SELF-DISTURBANCES IN EARLY–COURSE PSYCHOSIS: PRELIMINARY FINDINGS FROM A HIGH–DENSITY EEG STUDY",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Self-disturbances reflect a core dimension of Schizophrenia that can be identified before disease onset and might underlie the development of typical psychotic symptoms. The Sense of Agency (SoA) can be conceptualized as the pre-reflective sensation of being the one who is causing or generating an action or thought. Passivity phenomena, such as the reported feeling and belief that one’s thoughts or actions are generated and/or controlled by an external agent, are exquisite examples of SoA disturbances observed in Schizophrenia. Despite intensive research, the neurobiological pathogenetic mechanisms underlying such disturbances remain unclear. Among several putative neurophysiological brain abnormalities, a reduction of the Bereitschaftspotential, also called pre-motor or Readiness Potential (RP), was described in chronic, medicated patients with Schizophrenia. Given its anticipation of voluntary movement by 1 – 2 seconds over the motor cortex and supplementary motor area contralateral to the effector, RP has previously been proposed to be a neural signature of volition to initiate movement. Interestingly, higher RPs among healthy subjects have been recently associated with stronger intentional binding, suggesting increased SoA in subjects exhibiting stronger premovement activity. The objective of our work was to study RP abnormalities in patients with a psychotic illness of recent onset and to relate them to self disturbances, in order to clarify the relationship between known neurophysiological and psychopathological abnormalities. Methods We employed high-density electroencephalography (64-channel BrainAmp, Brain Products GmbH, Gilching, Germany) to record scalp potentials during a self-paced movement task in a group of seven early–course psychosis patients (mean age = 24,5, range 20–33) and an equal group of age– and gender– matched (mean age =25,3, range 19 – 36) healthy control subjects. Patients were recruited during an acute stage of their disorder requiring hospitalization and were treated with low–dose atypical antipsychotics. Exclusion criteria included major medical or neurological illness affecting the CNS and any intellectual developmental disorder. Several parameters related to the elicited RP were recorded, including maximum amplitude and slope. The Examination of Anomalous Self Experience (EASE) scale was chosen to assess Self disturbances in the patient group by an experienced clinician who was blind to the neurophysiological outcome. Results RP was found to be reduced in patients, compared to healthy control subjects, in both its amplitude and slope (p &amp;lt; 0,005) despite comparable EMG activity. EASE scores of items ‘EASE-10’ (a comprehensive item that reflect most prototypically the disorders of self-experience) and ‘EASE-2’ (“Self-Awareness”) appeared to increase monotonically with the decrease of RP slope (p &amp;lt; 0,05). Discussion Our preliminary data show that disturbances of RP are present since the early course of psychotic disorders. They also suggest that such abnormalities may reflect the severity of self-disturbances in these patients. If confirmed in a larger, medication-naïve samples, our findings might clarify the underlying neural mechanisms of such abnormalities and provide a solid basis for further investigation of RP disturbances as an early biological marker for Schizophrenia spectrum disorders.",

      "title": "Postcardiotomy Delirium: An Overview",
      "abstract": "Any one of a number of psychologic patterns may appear cardiotomy: (1) Some patients may be elated and confident after awakening from anesthesis and have no severe changes of affect or neurologic deficit. Denial seems to be for them an adequate defense against anxiety. (2) Others are disoriented and manifest neurologic disturbance immediately after awakening, without a lucid interval. The sensorium begins to clear five days after surgery. (3) Some patients go into delirium after being lucid for as long as a week and have hallucinations, illusions, and motor excitation for a few days-or over several weeks. Pathologic brain changes that are apparently anatomical correlates of neurologic deficits in delirium include anoxic lesions of the hippocampus, and infarcted foci. Physiologic factors that contribute to this reaction include: long periods of extracorporeal circulation, arterial hypotension during surgery, emboli, and low postoperative cardiac output. Age, and the type and severity of heart impairment are also factors. Psychologic factors to be taken into account include preexisting psychopathology and the failure of denial under the stress of physical symptoms or hospitalization. Delirium is fostered by sensory overload (or deprivation) in the recovery room and intensive care unit, and by staff tension. Modification of the intensive care unit environment, the administration of antipsychotic drugs, and metabolic correctives are recommended. Preoperative psychologic evaluation, with therapy as needed, preliminary familiarization with perioperative procedures, as well as collaboration between psychiatrist and surgeon, can do much to prevent post-cardiotomy delirium.",

      "abstract": "Hauptmerkmal der körperdysmorphen Störung (KDS) ist eine übermäßige Beschäftigung mit einem wahrgenommenen Makel oder Defekt im körperlichen Aussehen (z. B. ausdünnendes Haar, Falten, Größe oder Form der Nase), was zu signifikanten Beeinträchtigungen in sozialen oder beruflichen Lebensbereichen führt. Besteht eine leichte körperliche Anomalie, ist die Beschäftigung mit dem Defekt deutlich übertrieben und für andere Personen nicht nachvollziehbar. Assoziierte Merkmale der KDS sind unter anderem eine starke Angst vor negativer Bewertung aufgrund der äußeren Erscheinung sowie Vorstellungen, dass andere Personen negativ über den wahrgenommen Defekt sprechen. Ritualisierte Verhaltensweisen wie das Überprüfen des Aussehens in Spiegeln oder das Vergleichen mit anderen sind ebenso häufig vorzufinden. Studien zur Prävalenz in der Allgemeinbevölkerungen ergeben Schätzwerte von ca. 2 % mit einem ausgewogenen Geschlechterverhältnis. Für die Erklärung der KDS wurden bisher eine Reihe kognitiv-behavioraler Modelle entwickelt, die davon ausgehen, dass sowohl psychologische, biologische, soziokulturelle sowie Konditionierungsprozesse eine Rolle bei der Entstehung und Aufrechterhaltung der KDS spielen. In der Behandlung haben sich vor allem kognitiv-behaviorale Psychotherapieansätze und Psychopharmaka wie selektive Serotonin-Wiederaufnahmehemmer bewährt.",

By definition, ON is characterized by paroxysmal shooting or stabbing, sudden-onset pain that has frequent recurrence, lasting for a few minutes at a time. This pain syndrome is related to the nerve distribution that involves spinal nerves emerging from the upper cervical region that traverse to the base of the neck and run up the posterior scalp. It involves compression, injury, or trauma to greater occipital nerve (GON), lesser occipital nerve (LON), and then rarely due to third occipital nerve (TON). Conceptually, nerve entrapment between anatomical structures have been hypothesized to be a large contributing factor to the pathophysiology of ON. Most cases of ON are idiopathic with no clear etiology that is structurally identifiable. It is hypothesized that the pain from ON is due to compression, injury, or irritation (e.g. chronic instability, entrapment, trauma, inflammation) of the greater occipital nerve, lesser occipital nerve, and/or the third occipital nerve. Treatment can be conservative or interventional modalities.",

      "title": "Pathology of body images and analytic practice",
      "abstract": "Through clinical examples, Dolto describes the impacts of early trauma upon the body images and their mitigation through speech. With numerous detailed case studies, she goes systematically through various traumas (including the death of the mother) at different stages of development, beginning with pregnancy and birth, then the oral stage, the anal, genital-narcissistic and Oedipal phases, all the way through to adolescence. Deaths, accidents, illness and other events that cause sudden mother–child separations can impact upon the baby or child's unconscious body image and result in psychosomatic illness or developmental disturbances. Attuned attention and verbalisation can on the other hand alleviate the worst effects and steer the child's development back onto a healthy path. Dolto's startling and often moving clinical vignettes show families in situations of extreme danger, or in 'ordinary' stressful life events. Common neglect may lead to disastrous and permanent consequences, while the effects of near-death traumas can be mitigated by a symboligenic intervention. She presents a psychoanalytic but very common-sensical view of what can go wrong between the ages of a few months and 3 or 4 years of age, without pathologising behavioural disturbances as always being of medical origin. This will be of great relevance to all professionals involved with children, from paediatricians through to teachers and social workers. When writing about the fragility of adolescence, Dolto's consideration of unconscious of body images throws new light upon issues of adolescent moodiness, depression, anxiety and anorexia nervosa. Finally, Dolto describes the effects of disturbed body images on the adult mind in a section on hysterical conversion and psychosomatics. In conclusion, Dolto summarises her thinking about the making of the human subject and its embodiment in the flesh, considering how the subject spoken about, wanted or unwanted by its birth parents becomes interwoven with the fleshly creature whose bodily schema will be influenced by body images, and whose body images in turn will impact upon the functioning of this bodily schema and the subject's psychological development.",

Psychogenic muscular tension can have its origin in psychic trauma during bladder training at the age of 1-3 years, leading to an obsessive-compulsive personality structure. A tendency to muscular tension, especially in the pelvic region, as well as to disorders of the lower bowl can be found in afflicted persons. Psychological defence and avoidance reactions, problems with contact and security, sexual abuse in childhood, as well as stress, anxiety, disappointment and anger can be the result of psychic trauma. Typical triggers involve psychological actualisation or compression. Because of the tendency to muscular tension with many psychogenic symptoms of voiding dysfunction, dispensing of medication, physical muscle relaxant measures show good therapeutic results.",

Diaschisis most commonly manifests itself by such neurological signs as impaired consciousness or cognitive impairments including dementia, dyspraxias, dystaxias, dysphasias, incoordination and sensory neglect. The nature of diaschisis has been demonstrated by widespread depressions of local cerebral blood flow and metabolism extending far beyond the anatomical lesion. Recovery of function is associated with recovery of local perfusion and metabolism. [Neurol Res 1993; 15: 362-366]",

      "title": "Perioperative Hearing Impairment",
      "abstract": "PERIOPERATIVE hearing loss is a rarely reported phenomenon. However, it occurs more frequently than most anesthesiologists suspect. Perioperative hearing impairment is often subclinical and may go unnoticed unless audiometry is performed. 1–3It can be conductive or sensorineural, unilateral or bilateral, and transient or permanent. 4–8Hearing loss has been reported following virtually every type of anesthetic technique. The hearing mechanism may be less susceptible to acoustic trauma during general anesthesia, 9but other mechanisms are capable of causing both conductive and sensorineural hearing losses (SNHL) in the perioperative period. The etiologies include mechanical, traumatic, noise-induced, changes in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure, nitrous oxide, embolism, pharmacologic, and other miscellaneous causes.The cochlea is the auditory portion of the inner ear. It is a snail-shaped structure of 2.75 turns with an uncoiled length of approximately 3 cm (fig. 1). The cochlea is divided into three channels. The two outer channels, the scala vestibuli and the scala tympani, contain perilymphatic fluid and communicate at the apex through the helicotrema. The middle channel, the scala media (cochlear duct), contains endolymphatic fluid. In the conventional cross-sectional view of the cochlea (fig. 2), the scala media is triangular in shape. Its upper boundary, the vestibular or Reissner's membrane, attaches to the osseous spiral lamina and to the outer wall of the cochlea, separating it from the scala vestibuli. The lower boundary, the basilar membrane, also attaches to the osseous spiral lamina and the outer wall of the cochlea. The basilar membrane supports the hearing organ, the organ of Corti, and separates the scala media from the scala tympani. The lateral wall of the scala media is the highly vascular stria vascularis. At the base of the cochlea, the perilymph of the scala vestibuli contacts the oval window and the perilymph of the scala tympani contacts the round window (figs. 1 and 3).Arterial blood is supplied to the inner ear by the internal auditory artery, which arises from either the basilar or the inferior anterior cerebellar artery and passes through the internal auditory meatus with cranial nerve VIII. The arterial supply to the cochlea is via end vessels, with no collateral circulation. The afferent special somatic exteroceptive cochlear nerve provides innervation. The peripheral processes arise in the organ of Corti, their cell bodies forming the spiral ganglion of the cochlea in the osseous spiral lamina. The processes converge, traversing the modiolus to form the cochlear nerve, which passes through the internal acoustic meatus with the vestibular nerve. A smaller number of efferent nerve fibers arise from the olivary complexes and terminate axodendritically on the afferent dendrites that innervate the inner hair cells.The cochlear fluid system is made up of two fluids, perilymph and endolymph (fig. 2). Perilymph fills the scala vestibuli and scala tympani and has an ionic composition, low in potassium and high in sodium, similar to interstitial fluid and nearly identical to CSF. 10There are two theories regarding its origin: (1) it is filtrate produced by capillaries in the spiral ligament; and (2) it is CSF communicated to cochlea through the cochlear aqueduct, a small channel in the temporal bone near the round window, which connects the scala tympani directly to the subarachnoid space. The endolymphatic fluid is unique to the inner ear. It has a high concentration of potassium and a low concentration of sodium, similar to intracellular fluid. The stria vascularis is believed to be the source of the unique endolymph ionic composition. Although there is slow longitudinal flow of endolymph, maintenance of the critical ionic environment for the organ of Corti is due to local radial flow between the stria vascularis and nearby cells. Endolymphatic absorption takes place in the endolymphatic sac, a specialized structure of the membranous labyrinth. The endolymphatic sac is located in the subdural space and communicates with the membranous labyrinth via the endolymphatic duct (fig. 1). It is thought to participate in balancing endolymphatic pressures with changes in CSF pressure. Two-way flow through a patent cochlear aqueduct provides relatively rapid perilymphatic pressure equilibration with the CSF. Endolymphatic pressure regulation is considerably slower, being primarily a function of production and absorption. Only minor and temporary pressure adjustments are made by the endolymphatic sac.The organ of Corti, the hearing transduction mechanism, is located in the cochlear duct (scala media). The sensory cells of the organ of Corti are mechanoreceptors with stereocilia projecting from the top of the cells into the endolymph. 11There are two types of hair cells, outer (OHC) and inner (IHC) hair cells (fig. 2). They differ in morphology, microanatomical location, and function. The IHCs and OHCs initiate the transduction process by transforming the acoustic signal into neural activity. Activation of the hair cells causes neurotransmitter release that depolarizes afferent dendrites causing an all-or-none spike discharge in individual auditory nerve fibers. Overlying the organ of Corti is a gelatinous flap, the tectorial membrane. The tectorial membrane is attached on its medial edge to the spiral limbus and laterally is in contact with the stereocilia of the OHCs. Since the tectorial membrane and basilar membrane have different medial attachment locations, upward or downward displacement of basilar membrane induces shearing displacements of the hairs in contact with the tectorial membrane. These various bending movements of the OHC stereocilia can cause excitation or inhibition. Excitation initiates the transduction of acoustic energy into neural signals. In contrast to OHCs, the stereocilia of the IHC are not embedded in the tectorial membrane but rest in a groove near the undersurface of the tectorial membrane. The IHC do not respond to displacement of the basilar membrane, but they do respond to the velocity of displacement of the basilar membrane. The neural signals initiated by the IHCs and OHCs are transmitted through the acoustic division of cranial nerve VIII ultimately to the auditory cortex of the temporal lobe.A simplified diagram of the cochlea uncoiled is usually used to describe cochlear mechanics (fig. 3). On the left is the base of the cochlea with the stapes and oval window. Below these structures and adjoining the scala vestibuli is the round window of the scala tympani. In the diagram, the uncoiled cochlea is divided horizontally by a line representing the scala media, Reissner's membrane, the organ of Corti, and the basilar membrane. However, this line, for purposes of understanding cochlear mechanics, can be thought of as simply the basilar membrane. Above the dividing line is the scala vestibuli, and below is the scala tympani. Because of the inertia of the fluid mass and frictional resistance to fluid flow in the narrow channels of the scala, inward or outward motion of the stapes against the oval window causes a pressure wave to travel down the scala; there is no fluid flow. Since the fluids are incompressible within the bony cochlea, the pressure wave traveling down the scala vestibuli causes the basilar membrane to deflect downward toward the scala tympani for positive pressures and upward for negative pressures. The flexible round window compensates for pressure changes transmitted to the scala tympani. For the acute changes caused by pressure waves in the audible frequencies, the connection between the scala vestibuli and the scala tympani, the helicotrema, functions as though it were closed. The helicotrema is only involved in very slow equalization of pressures between the two scalae.The most important property of the basilar membrane is its ability to separate various frequencies. The compliance of the basilar membrane changes by a factor of greater than 100 from base to apex. At the base, near the oval window, the basilar membrane is narrower and thicker, making it less compliant (fig. 3). It is wider and thinner at the apex, resulting in greater compliance. Since a system's resonant frequency is directly proportional to stiffness and inversely proportional to mass, the stiff base responds maximally to high frequencies (> 4,000 Hz), and the compliant apex responds maximally to low frequencies (< 1,000 Hz). In short, the basilar membrane functions as a sharply tuned bandpass filter, performing a spectral analysis on the incoming sound (pressure) waves. The effect is to translate the frequency of incoming sound into distance along the basilar membrane, a frequency-to-place or tonotopical transformation. Therefore, both IHCs and OHCs at a specific point along the basilar membrane respond to a very specific, narrow frequency range. Excited hair cells depolarize specific acoustic neurons, and the information is finally interpreted in the auditory centers.Clinical or subclinical hearing loss following spinal anesthesia or lumbar puncture has been reported frequently(table 1). 4,6–8,12–24Despite many reports, few anesthesiologists appear to be aware of the possibility of this complication. Since there has been no large-scale audiometric study of hearing loss associated with spinal anesthesia, the precise incidence of clinical or subclinical hearing loss is unknown but may occur more frequently than appreciated. Further, the specific presentation and onset of the hearing deficit after spinal anesthesia can vary widely.The first case of hearing loss associated with spinal anesthesia 25was reported in 1914. In 1956, Vandam and Dripps 26reported that of 9,277 patients who had spinal anesthesia, 0.4% experienced auditory difficulties, such as impaired hearing, tinnitus, buzzing, or roaring. Few specific data were gathered, and no audiometry of these patients was performed. Michel et al. 27described nine cases of hearing loss following myelography, diagnostic lumbar puncture, and spinal anesthesia. The hearing deficits were almost uniformly in the lower frequencies (125–1,000 Hz). The deficits were bilateral in six of the nine patients. Six of the nine patients had full recoveries in less than 1 month without treatment.In addition to these case reports, there have been several studies of hearing loss related to spinal anesthesia. In one study, 6 of 14 patients had audiometrically detectable mild hearing deficits in the low-frequency range that resolved spontaneously in 1–7 months. 28Walsted et al. 29tested 34 patients with audiometry before and after spinal anesthesia. Most of the patients had a small but significant threshold shift at 500 Hz. However, one patient developed a considerable unilateral hearing loss in the low-frequency range, which persisted until an epidural blood patch was performed. Gultekin et al. 30used pure tone audiometry to test hearing before and after spinal anesthesia for hernia repair. Fourteen patients (32%), despite being unaware of it, had audiometrically measurable low-frequency hearing losses. All spinal anesthetics were performed with 22-gauge Quincke needles (needle gauge and design are discussed in the next section), and the authors suggested that hearing loss was less frequent when the anesthetic agent was bupivacaine rather than prilocaine. In 35 patients undergoing elective cesarean section under spinal anesthesia (24-gauge Sprotte needle), pure tone audiometry revealed that five patients had developed low-frequency hearing loss on the first postoperative day. 31The deficits were unilateral in three patients and bilateral in the other two. All patients had full recovery without treatment by the fifth postoperative day. In contrast, Finegold et al. 32found no audiometric hearing decrement postoperatively in 44 patients undergoing cesarean section under spinal anesthesia. Half of the patients' spinals were performed with 25-gauge Quincke needles; 24-gauge Sprotte needles were used for the other half. This is the only study of 13 found that failed to show a relationship between spinal anesthesia and hearing loss. Hearing acuity is affected by hormonal changes, 33,34but peripartum changes have not been documented. The explanation for this singular result may be in the study's methodology.In a study of 100 patients undergoing elective urologic procedures under spinal anesthesia, eight patients experienced noticeable hearing impairment. 18Audiometry was performed on three of the patients and revealed a 30-dB loss in the low-frequency range. Hearing deficits resolved within a short time without treatment. In another study of 100 patients undergoing elective general or urologic surgery under spinal anesthesia, 16 had audiometrically documented hearing losses. 3The hearing loss typically affected only the frequencies between 125 and 2,000 Hz. The deficits were usually detected on the second day after the spinal anesthetic and in all cases resolved within 3 days without treatment. The incidence of hearing loss after spinal anesthesia for men under 30 yr of age was compared to that in men over the age of 60. 35Fifty-two percent (13 of 25) of the younger and 16% of the older patients had significant hearing losses (≤ 10 dB) confined to the low-frequency range (125–500 Hz). There was no hearing impairment in the speech frequencies (500–2,000 Hz) and higher frequencies for either group. No patient was aware of a hearing deficit, and no patient developed a post–dural puncture headache (PDPH). In a recent study of hearing loss following spinal versus general anesthesia, there were audiometric losses in both groups, although the spinal group had significantly greater hearing losses, particularly in the low-frequency range. 36Interestingly, in the spinal group, increases in the low-frequency audible threshold were inversely related to the preoperative low-frequency audible threshold.Overall, it appears that 10–50% of patients receiving spinal anesthesia experience an audiometrically measurable low-frequency hearing deficit. Less than one fourth of these patients have a clinical, or noticeable, hearing loss.The size of the needle used for dural puncture appears to play a role in postspinal anesthetic hearing impairment. The hearing loss may be a result of CSF leakage even when the CSF loss is insufficient to cause a PDPH. Fog et al. 2found that 13 of 14 patients whose spinal anesthetics were performed with a 22-gauge needle had a 10-dB or greater hearing loss across the audible frequency range with significantly greater losses in the low-frequency range. Only 4 of the 14 patients in whom a 26-gauge needle was used had similar hearing impairment, and none had significant (> 10 dB) losses. When spinal anesthesia was performed with a 26-gauge needle, 37only one of nine patients was found to have a low-frequency hearing loss, which was severe but transient. Interestingly, this patient also experienced a PDPH. In another study of 100 patients, 50 had spinal anesthesia using either a 20- or a 22-gauge needle. Of these, 10% had significant decreases in audiometric values in the 250- to 500-Hz frequency range on the first postoperative day that resolved spontaneously within 5 days. 38In the 50 patients in whom 24- and 25-gauge needles were used, no decrement in audiometric values occurred. Oncel et al. 1used pure tone audiometry at 125 Hz preoperatively and postoperatively to assess hearing loss. Three groups of 15 patients were studied. One group received epidural anesthesia. In the other two groups, spinal anesthesia was performed with either a 22- or 25-gauge needle. No hearing impairments were detected in the epidural group. There was significantly greater hearing loss in the 22-gauge group versus the 25-gauge spinal group. None of the study patients developed a PDPH. The authors suggested that pure tone audiometry may be a more sensitive indicator of CSF leakage than the presence of PDPH.Needle design may also play a role in hearing impairment following lumbar puncture. Using audiometry, Sundberg et al. 39compared the effect of 22-gauge cutting-tip (Quincke) to 22-gauge pencil-point (Whitacre) needles on postspinal hearing loss. A hearing loss of at least 10 dB at two or more frequencies below 1,000 Hz was observed in 6 of 25 (24%) patients in the Quincke group as compared to only 2 of 23 (9%) in the Whitacre group. In addition, of those patients with hearing deficits, the mean hearing level was significantly worse in the Quincke group. This study suggests an association between the design of the spinal needle tip and postoperative hearing dysfunction that is similar to the relationship between the needle types and the incidence of PDPH, implying a similar pathogenesis. Lamberg et al. , 40using audiometric testing, compared hearing losses after a single-shot spinal with a 25-gauge Quincke needle with those following a continuous spinal anesthetic (19-gauge Touhy-type needle and 22-gauge catheter). None of the patients developed a PDPH or were aware of a hearing loss. However, nine (43%) of the single-shot patients and seven (37%) of continuous spinal patients had hearing deficits in excess of 10 dB when tested postoperatively. This result also seems to parallel experience with the cause and incidence of PDPH.In summary, hearing impairment following neuraxial anesthesia seems to be related to the same factors (age, needle gauge, and needle type) that are implicated in CSF leakage and PDPH. 41Two of the studies cited above included a total of 27 patients who received epidural anesthesia. Audiometric testing did not reveal measurable postoperative auditory impairment in any of these patients. On the other hand, the consensus of the studies indicates a consistent rate (10–50%) of SNHL in the low frequencies after lumbar puncture. Also, postspinal hearing impairment resolved without treatment, usually within several days, again suggesting an etiology common with that of PDPH. Interestingly, in two reports, patients who received epidural blood patches for PDPH had simultaneous reversal of their postspinal, low-frequency hearing loss. 4,29Cerebrospinal fluid leakage can cause a decrease in the CSF pressure that may be transmitted to the inner ear. A relative balance in the endolymphatic and perilymphatic pressures maintains the normal structural conformation in the inner ear. Disruption of this pressure balance can cause hearing impairment as well as impairment of semicircular canal function. A change in CSF pressure is promptly transmitted through a patent cochlear aqueduct to the inner ear perilymph (fig. 2). 6,42–45A decrease in CSF pressure following a dural puncture and CSF leak would cause a rapid and similar decrease in perilymph pressure. The endolymphatic system, however, responds much more slowly. Endolymphatic pressure–volume adjustments are primarily the result of altered endolymph production at the stria vascularis or altered absorption at the endolymphatic sac. Therefore, an acute drop in CSF pressure could result in endolymphatic pressure sufficiently exceeding that of the perilymph to cause distortions of both Reissner's membrane and the basilar membrane. The consequent disruption in the position of the hair cells results in hearing impairment. 10This mechanism has been postulated in several reports. 3,6,8,46Walsted et al. 47proposed such a mechanism in 1991. Later, in controlled prospective studies of neurosurgical patients and in animal studies, she showed the relationship between CSF loss and low-frequency hearing impairment. 48–52The finding that the degree of hearing impairment is correlated with the size of the spinal needle further supports the theory that postspinal hearing loss and PDPH share a common etiology: leakage of CSF from the subarachnoid space. 1,2Distortion of the basilar membrane and hearing loss could also be caused by acute increases in CSF pressure transmitted to the perilymph. In a case report, Hardy 53postulated that injection into the epidural space caused an acute increase in CSF pressure that was immediately transmitted through the cochlear aqueduct to the perilymph, thus distorting the basilar membrane and causing an acute low-frequency hypoacusis.Finally, if the mechanism of postspinal hearing loss is the same as for PDPH, several questions arise: why do we not see as many patients with vestibular symptoms; why does not every patient with a severe PDPH experience hearing impairment; and why are some hearing losses unilateral? In response to the first question, not only are the changes in CSF pressure transmitted less rapidly to the vestibular apparatus, but the vestibular apparatus is somewhat less sensitive than the cochlea to perilymph–endolymph pressure imbalances. Further, the hearing deficit may be subclinical, not obvious without audiometric testing. In answer to the second question, as many as 7% of adults have an anatomically obstructed cochlear aqueduct, and as many as 30% have a functionally obstructed aqueduct. 44,45,54For these patients, CSF pressure changes are not transmitted to the perilymph, and, therefore, a severe PDPH could exist without a hearing deficit. This mechanism may also explain the cases of unilateral hearing deficit. In addition, restricted cochlear aqueduct flow and the mechanical compliance of the cochlear windows can limit the stress of CSF pressure changes.The reports cited above indicate that the great majority of hearing deficits that result from lumbar puncture or CSF loss occur in the low frequencies and, in most cases, bilaterally. We propose that this is the result of the physical characteristics of the basilar membrane. At the cochlear base, where higher frequencies are transduced, the basilar membrane is narrow, thick, and stiff, and therefore resistant to pressure changes that are not in its resonant frequency range (fig. 3). At the cochlear apex, where low frequencies are transduced, the basilar membrane is much more compliant. Changes in CSF pressure transmitted to the perilymph can cause significant static displacement of the basilar membrane, disrupting the normal OHC relationship to the tectorial membrane and resulting in low-frequency hearing loss. Hearing loss confined to the low frequencies is unlikely due to CSF pressure–mediated stretch or pressure injury to cranial nerve VIII.It is interesting to note that the low-frequency hearing loss observed in Ménière's syndrome involves a similar mechanism. In Ménière's syndrome, instead of a decrease in perilymphatic pressure relative to endolymphatic pressure, there is an increase in endolymphatic pressure (endolymphatic hydrops). This imbalance in pressures would cause a similar distortion of the basilar membrane with the greatest effect at the cochlear apex and resulting, at least in the early stages, in a hearing loss (low frequency) similar to that which can occur after spinal anesthesia.Presuming that hearing impairment following spinal anesthesia or dural puncture has the same etiology as PDPH, i.e. , loss of CSF or decreased CSF pressure, then the treatment and prognosis should be similar. Figure 4indicates that untreated hearing impairments following dural puncture recover fully greater than 95% of the time. Several authors have noted improvement in auditory symptoms after an epidural blood patch. 4,29,55Lybecker et al. 46prospectively studied the effects of an epidural blood patch on hearing in patients with severe PDPH caused by dural puncture. They performed audiometry at several frequencies 1 h before and 1 h after an epidural blood patch. Twelve of the 16 patients had significant audiometric improvement in hearing. Simply changing position from sitting to supine improved hearing in half of the patients in the absence of the blood patch. This study offers clear evidence of the potential efficacy of epidural blood patch for post–dural puncture hearing loss. In another case report in which conservative measures followed by two epidural blood patches failed to relieve a severe PDPH and bilateral low-frequency hearing loss, an epidural dextran 40 infusion relieved the headache and reversed the hearing loss. 56Rosenberg et al. 57performed an audiometric study of 20 patients undergoing surgery with interscalene brachial plexus block anesthesia. Four of the patients (20%) experienced hearing impairment at various frequencies on the side of the block. The low frequencies (250–500 Hz) were affected in only one patient who also had hearing threshold decrements on the opposite side of 15–20 dB measured in the 6,000- to 10,000-Hz range (table 2). Farrell et al. 58described four patients with sudden permanent deafness following anesthesia for dental surgery. Anesthesia for three of the patients was local infiltration or nerve block, and the fourth had general anesthesia. The patient who had general anesthesia had bilateral SNHL, while the three other patients had ipsilateral SNHL. Similarly, Shenkman et al. 59reported a case in which permanent neurologic symptoms, ipsilateral hearing impairment, a facial nerve palsy, and ataxia occurred following an inferior alveolar nerve block. These findings are summarized in table 2.Within 24 h after the interscalene blocks, all four of the patients had spontaneous resolution of their hearing deficits. 57The authors postulated that the mechanism of hearing loss involved an effect due to sympathetic blockade. Vasodilation caused by the sympathetic block may have developed, resulting in edema of the mucosal membranes of both the Eustachian tube and the middle ear and producing a hearing decrement on that side. The hearing loss resolved within 24 h without treatment in all four patients.With regard to the hearing deficits following dental procedures, the authors 58,59could not identify a specific etiology for any of the cases. Several possibilities were considered. Noise-induced hearing loss from dental drills is known to result in temporary, noise-induced, bilateral hearing deficits. 60Dental extractions are known to cause microemboli that could reach the cochlear vasculature and cause temporary or permanent hearing impairment. 58Vasoconstrictors are usually used with local anesthesia for dental procedures. Intravascular injection could cause vasospasm of the cochlear division of the internal auditory artery. 58Finally, nociceptive afferents or autonomic nerve fibers could initiate a reflex vasoconstriction of critical vessels to the hearing structures. Hearing loss during dental procedures appears to be quite rare and usually temporary.Hearing impairment after general anesthesia for non–cardiopulmonary bypass surgery is rare. Our review of the English language literature through 2001 revealed only 35 reported (29 documented audiometrically) cases of hearing loss after general anesthesia (table 3).Evan et al. 61reported three cases of SNHL following general anesthesia; one patient recovered, and the other two sustained permanent hearing loss. The authors were unable to elucidate the etiology in any of the patients. Cox and Sargent 62reported three cases of hearing loss following nonotologic surgery. Two patients had permanent, profound unilateral hearing loss, and one patient had moderate bilateral hearing loss. Velazquez 63described a case of acute unilateral hearing deficit following abdominal surgery under general anesthesia. Other authors have described bilateral hearing impairment immediately following minor abdominal surgeries. 64,65It should also be noted that some patients who receive general anesthesia come to the operating room from an intensive care unit having already sustained an unrecognized hearing loss. Halpern et al. 66have discussed the myriad causes of hearing loss in the critical care setting.Although the etiology of hearing loss associated with general anesthesia often cannot be ascertained, there are a number of potential etiologies: changes in middle ear pressure, vascular pathology, CSF pressure changes, embolism, ototoxic drugs, and other miscellaneous causes.Excessive or sudden changes in middle ear pressure can disrupt the tympanic membrane, the round window, and the conducting structures. Excessive middle ear pressure can cause the round window to rupture, resulting in significant hearing loss. 67,68This type of injury has been described as occurring during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. 69Two patients who were successfully resuscitated developed partial deafness, one from disarticulation of the incomalleal joint and the other from an oval window perilymph fistula. It was postulated that during vigorous mask ventilation, excessive pressure was suddenly transmitted through the Eustachian tube causing the middle ear injuries.Nitrous oxide (N2O) anesthesia was shown in the late 1960s to be capable of causing oscillations of middle ear pressures that could result in tympanic perforation and cause hearing loss. 70,71Depending on the uptake or elimination phase, N2O can displace tympanic membrane grafts outward or inward and disrupt reconstructed middle ear conducting structures. Segal et al. 72described a case of labyrinthine membrane rupture and sustained SNHL due to elevated intratympanic pressure during general anesthesia with N2O. The degree of intratympanic pressure fluctuation is a function of N2O concentration and its rate of change. Several cases of middle ear injury have been described as resulting from sudden changes in intratympanic pressure during general anesthesia with N2O. 73–77Further, the patency of the Eustachian tube may play a role in potential injury during N2O anesthesia. During N2O elimination, Eustachian tube obstruction can result in significant negative middle ear pressure and tympanic perforation. 78A vascular pathogenesis is another possible mechanism for hearing impairment after general anesthesia.

      "abstract": "Introduction:It is a well-known fact that child development is a complex process and includes sensor and motor development; this development goes in cephalocaudal direction, from proximal to distal, from gross movements to minor movements etc. Early treatment is particularly essential for children with cerebral palsy. This treatment should start at the stage of infancy (3-4 months). During this stage adaptive and plastic skills are developed in an infant brain. As it is known, toddler development during first 18 months goes on rapidly. This is the best period not only for learning, but also for adapting to limited abilities. In most cases treatment at early age results in better results in a short period, as toddlers at this stage do not have many of anomalous patterns developed and they become evident at later stages. In this point of view, mother training is also very essential, so that the toddler can make normal movements. [1, 2] Cause of anomalous development is a formation of the so-called blocks and compensative movements developed as a result of these blocks that furtherly results in harder anomalous development [6]. Having certain balance between bending and stretching muscle movements, is essential for overcoming gravitation power and keeping postural ton [4]. In case of losing this balance it is difficult for child to make movements and keep appropriate posture at the same time. [3, 9].Athetosis, chorea and dystonia are clinically apparent to dyskinetic cerebral palsy. Athetosis is characterised by slow, transitional athetosic movements in distal muscles by dyssynergia of antagonist muscles. Anomalous movements become more intensive or cause changes in emotions, postures or aimed movements; they are characterized by impediments in reverse development of simple reflexes, with face grimace and oropharyngeal difficulties [5, 7]. Choreic movements are faster, and irregular; they are connected with face, bulbar muscles and basically, muscles of proximal group. Chorea becomes more severe in cases of excitement and fever; ballism may also be symptomatic to chorea. Dystonia is characterized with trunck and limbs abnormal postures. In cases of dyskinetic cerebral palsy muscles tone is changing. This may be characterized with hypotonia at the age of infantry; if hypotonia is changed by hypertonia later on it is mainly characterized by tension that decreases during relaxation or change of posture. Tension is a sudden involuntary hypertonia in bending as well as stretching muscles; in cases of voluntary movements limbs become stiff. Deep reflexes are normal or provoked rarely; there is no clonus and plantar answer; dyskinetic cerebral palsy is characterized with several simultaneous involuntary movements [6, 4]. Though, mainly it is divided into athetosis and dystonia types; athetosis is characterized by chorial, athetoid or both types of movements; muscle tone is normal or hypotonic and mainly dystonic; in cases of dystonia, tension and newborn strong reflexes predominance, it is important to consider the folowing factors while selecting physical therapy [8, 7]:1. Appropriately selected physical exercises are essential2. It is necessary to apply therapeutic exercises in cases of dyskinetic cerebral palsy3. It is important that exercises are challenging, so that they are interesting and give some stimuli to child4. There are no dystonic spasms5. Achieving symmetric posture of the whole trunck6. As proximal mobility is increased it is essential to decrease mobilityMaterials and Methods:The research was carried out at the Medical and Educational Center of Children Neurology and Neurorehabilitation of Tbilisi. All children under observation had dyskinetic cerebral palsy. Their conditions were evaluated by neurologist who made diagnosis and determined the severity level of cerebral palsy. These children underwent specific graded exercise therapy developed by us, in accordance with the severity of illness. …",

Importantly, rates are rising during the pandemic.Suicidal symptoms can develop with depression and, less commonly, with anxiety disorders.In 2019, almost 25% of girls and more than 10% of boys seriously considered suicide.Symptoms are especially common among lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer or questioning (LGBTQ+) youth and Black youth.If you are worried your child is thinking about self-harm, contact a health care professional immediately.Parents, teachers, and pediatric primary care clinicians can monitor for signs of depression and anxiety including school difficulties, changes in sleep or eating, getting along with friends or family, withdrawing from activities, and using screening questionnaires for depression or anxiety in health care visits.Depression and anxiety are treatable with therapy that teaches specific skills, medications, or both.Specific treatment plans de-pend on age, severity of symptoms, ability to access therapy, and family preferences.Families can take care of your own mental health, talk about feelings starting at an early age; teach and model healthy coping strategies; keep your child safe from weapons, abuse, and preventable incidents; and talk to your child's health care professional.Some family and community health strategies to prevent depressionandanxietyincludeparentsaccessingtheirownmentalhealthcare; teaching families skills for effective communication and managing feelings;introducinganti-bullyingandantidiscriminationactivities;supporting families to access basic needs like food and safe housing; and preventing exposure to extreme stresses like abuse and disasters.",

      "abstract": "Among the many different negative life events commonly associated with an increased risk of suicidal behaviour, exposure to traumatic stress with their associated traumatic stress syndromes are often overlooked in suicidal groups since they are usually not the presenting complaint or they belong to the patient's past. Post-traumatic stress responses with their secondary ill-effects may be caused by brief or single overwhelming events such as disasters, violent assault, rape, terrorism or acts of war. Manifest and enduring symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are usually only seen in those who have been exposed to particularly severe traumatisation or who have been more vulnerable, but frequently lead to additional severe secondary problems such as affective disorders (more than 50% comorbidity), substance abuse and social and relational problems. These are all conditions or disorders leading to an increased the risk of suicidal behaviour, which has indeed been observed in a number of studies of traumatized groups. Examples of the second type of traumatic stress exposure - the long-lasting or chronic traumatisation - are prolonged childhood abuse, long-term battering relationships, combat experiences, concentration camp experiences and torture. These types of traumatic stress have the ability to create more complex clinical stress responses such as personality disturbances, dissociation, behavioural changes and self-destructive behaviour ranging from self-mutilation to completed suicide. In this lecture an update on research into the association between trauma and suicidal behaviour will be presented and implications for preventive work discussed. Language: en",

      "title": "Concepto y manejo práctico de la fragilidad en neurología",
      "abstract": "Frailty is a clinical situation of decreased homeostatic reserve that, after a minor trigger (acute illness, fall, taking a drug...) increases the risk of an adverse event such as hospital admission, institutionalization, functional and/or cognitive decline, death, etc. Frailty can be understood as physical frailty, Fried's phenotype, a true geriatric syndrome that can be reversible by avoiding its progression to more advanced stages of irreversibility and dependence, and Rockwood's frailty due to accumulation of deficits, as a continuum of health or classification typology of the elderly along the frailty spectrum (healthy, robust, vulnerable, mild-moderate-severe and extreme frailty or end of life). The diagnosis of physical frailty is part of the comprehensive geriatric assessment, recommending the use of a performance test such as gait speed (<0,8m/s), Timed Up and Go (>12 s) or Short Physical Performance Battery (<10). Physical frailty is reversible by a multidisciplinary management based on three fundamental pillars: multicomponent physical exercise and resistance training, adequate protein and micronutrient intake (leucine, vitamin D, etc.) and appropriate pharmacological prescription, management of comorbidity and geriatric syndromes. Frailty is a risk factor for neurological disease progression and increased risk of adverse events in neurodegenerative diseases such as mild cognitive impairment, dementia, Parkinson's disease and cerebrovascular disease. Frailty based on the Clinical Frailty Scale or VIG-Frail shows patient typologies in relation to a greater or lesser state of fragility, being a basic prognostic tool of great utility in making diagnostic and therapeutic management decisions. It opens up a new opportunity for improvement in the management of neurological disease in the diagnosis and treatment of frailty.Concepto y manejo práctico de la fragilidad en neurología.La fragilidad se entiende como un situación clínica de disminución de la reserva homeostática que, ante un desencadenante (enfermedad aguda, caída, toma de un fármaco...), aumenta el riesgo de un evento adverso, como ingreso hospitalario, en residencia, deterioro funcional y/o cognitivo, muerte, etc. La fragilidad puede entenderse como fragilidad física, fenotipo de Fried, verdadero síndrome geriátrico, que puede ser reversible evitando su progresión a estadios más avanzados de irreversibilidad y de dependencia, y fragilidad por acúmulo de déficits de Rockwood, como continuum de salud o tipología de clasificación del anciano a lo largo del espectro de la fragilidad (sano, robusto, vulnerable, fragilidad leve-moderada-grave y extrema o final de vida). El diagnóstico de fragilidad física forma parte de la valoración geriátrica integral y se recomienda para su diagnóstico utilizar un test de ejecución, como velocidad de la marcha (menor de 0,8 m/s), Timed Up and Go (>12 segundos) o Short Physical Performance Battery (menor de 10). La fragilidad física es reversible basándose en un tratamiento multidisciplinar sobre tres pilares fundamentales: ejercicio físico multicompetente y contra resistencia, aporte adecuado de proteínas y micronutrientes (leucina, vitamina D, etc.), y adecuada prescripción farmacológica, de tratamiento de comorbilidad y de síndromes geriátricos. La fragilidad es un factor de riesgo de progresión de la enfermedad neurológica y de mayor riesgo de evento adverso tanto en enfermedades neurodegenerativas, como el deterioro cognitivo leve, la demencia o la enfermedad de Parkinson, como en la enfermedad cerebrovascular. La fragilidad a través de la Clinical Frailty Scale o el VIG-Frail muestra tipologías de pacientes en relación con un mayor o menor estado de fragilidad, y es una herramienta básica pronóstica de gran utilidad en la toma de decisiones de manejo diagnóstico y terapéutico. Se abre una nueva oportunidad de mejora en el manejo de la enfermedad neurológica ante el diagnóstico y el tratamiento de la fragilidad.",

      "title": "Somatoform Disorders and a History of Abuse",
      "abstract": "• Summary: Somatoform disorders and functional somatic syndromes are defined as the presence of physical symptoms in the absence of sufficient tissue or organ damage to account for the degree of pain or dysfunction. Many people who suffer from these disorders have a history of childhood abuse. Because these individuals may also have a number of other difficulties in living, social workers encounter such clients in diverse fields of practice. Clients who fall into the category of adult survivors of abuse with a somatoform disorder may experience certain interventions by doctors, therapists, and other helping professionals (including social workers) as repeating interactions they had with their abusers. • Findings: Adult survivors of abuse who have a somatoform disorder often have parallel experiences in terms of their abuse and their somatic symptoms: important others communicate that the abuse and the symptoms are not real, are the client’s fault, and/or that the client is over-reacting to the abuse and symptoms. Furthermore, adult survivors of abuse may experience helping professionals as distinctly non-nurturing and as engaging in distancing behaviours. These interactions may stand in the way of helping members of this population, or even add to the client’s distress. There are specific practices in which the social worker may engage to help avoid these kinds of relations. • Applications: Social workers in a number of fields of practice may be alerted to dynamics common among adult survivors of abuse with a somatoform disorder. In the event that a client falls into this category, the informed social worker can avoid recapitulating abuse dynamics as well as help clients understand their diagnosis and why interactions with helping professionals may have been upsetting.",

      "title": "AON-Mediated Exon Skipping for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy",
      "abstract": "Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a genetic, X-chromosome recessive, severe and progressive muscle wasting disorder, affecting around 1 in 3500 newborn boys. The onset of the disease is in early childhood and, nowadays, most children are diagnosed before the age of 5. The first signs of muscular weakness become apparent around the age of 2 or 3 years. In most patients the age at which the child starts to walk is delayed (retarded motor development). The children have less endurance and difficulties with running and climbing stairs (Moser, 1984). Gower’s sign is a reflection of the weakness of the muscles of the lower extremities (knee and hip extensors): the child helps himself to get upright from sitting position by using his upper extremities: first by rising to stand on his arms and knees, and then “walking” his hands up his legs to stand upright (Gowers, 1895). Muscle wasting is often symmetrical, however not all muscles are affected to the same extent. A prominent feature of the disease is enlargement of the calve muscle, caused by replacement of muscle fibres by connective and adipose tissue. Furthermore, the pelvic girdle, trunk and abdomen are severely affected and to a lesser extent the shoulder girdle and proximal muscles of the upper extremities. Progressive weakness and contractures of the leg muscles lead to wheelchair-dependency around the age of 10. Thereafter the muscle contractions increase rapidly leading to spinal deformities and scoliosis, often with an asymmetric distribution pattern. Involvement of the intercostal muscles and distortion of the thorax lead to respiratory failure and patients often require assisted ventilation in the mid to late teens. Thereafter dilated cardiomyopathy becomes apparent and most patients die before the age of 30. Another common feature is mental retardation (IQ less than 70) in around 20-30% of the patients (Emery, 2002).",

In the case of musculoskeletal chronic pain, frequent physical activity is beneficial. However, reluctance to engage in physical activity is common due to negative psychological associations (eg, fear) between movement and pain. It is known that encouragement, self-efficacy, and positive beliefs are effective to bolster physical activity. However, given that the majority of time is spent away from personnel who can give such encouragement, there is a great need for an automated ubiquitous solution.",

The effects of TBI can be very subtle, but often have wide and far-reaching consequences in both the short and longer-term. As brain systems are constantly evolving, injury may impair current, and future, abilities, by eroding their foundations. TBI increases the risk of social isolation, behavioural disorder and psychiatric morbidity. It may contribute to problems leading to school exclusion and to entry to the criminal justice system. Indeed, TBI is associated with earlier, more violent and persistent offending.",

The actions are generally closer in nature to addictive disorders, being ego syntonic, and less like true impulsive disorders which patients may try to resist [1]. Punding represents a need to perform senseless activities repeatedly, such as folding and refolding clothes in a drawer for hours at a time, polishing pennies, or pulling weeds from a lawn or threads from a rug. The more common ICDs include gambling disorder, compulsive sexual disorder, consumerism, and hobbyism, but may include strikingly unusual activities that are extraordinarily narrow in their focus. The DDS seems to be a form of drug addictive behavior, similar to that of the usual addictive drugs.",

      "abstract": "The modern concept of stress is based on responses to events or factors (\"stressors\") experienced as aversive, threatening or excessive for maintaining physiological equilibrium of an organism. Prolonged exposure to stressors, particularly during early life, is strongly associated with later psychiatric disorders. Underlying mechanistic connections between stress responses and development of psychiatric illnesses remain uncertain and typically appear to be nonspecific. Relevant candidate mechanisms are likely to include the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, marked by sustained excessive release of cortisol from the adrenal cortex. In turn, this process is influenced by and alters various central neurotransmitter and other molecular signaling systems that include glutamate, dopamine, serotonin, and neurotrophic peptides. Additional manifestations of stress include altered neurogenesis and neuroplasticity, as well as oxidative neuron-damaging effects. The complex molecular systems involved in these processes present many opportunities for innovative pharmacological interventions that may have preventive or therapeutic benefits regarding mental illnesses arising from stress.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION :- Gym instructors within the fitness industry play a pivotal role in guiding individuals towards achieving a range of health and fitness goals. In addition to muscular and skeletal health, gym instructors are instrumental in boosting the immune system. Even though they help in maintaining the body gym trainers have a limited knowledge of mechanism of injury, neglecting and repetitive movements of the joint leads to worsening of injury and increase in the pain. Musculoskeletal pain can stem from various sources, including uncommon or repetitive activities that strain muscles, tendons, and ligaments. Additionally, it may result from sudden, jerky movements, falls, fractures, or underlying musculoskeletal conditions. The result of repetitive activities that strain the muscles, tendons and sprain the ligaments. Insufficient recovery time, rapid pace work, repetitive motion patterns, heavy weight lifting, forceful manual exertions, mechanical pressure concentrations or whole body vibrations can lead to development of other musculoskeletal disorders. The impact of a musculoskeletal condition on an individual's quality of life is substantial, extending beyond mere physical discomfort. Such conditions not only affect personal well-being but also impose a considerable financial strain, manifested through compensation payments and lost wages. Instances of sick leave, absenteeism, and even job abandonment contribute to diminished job efficiency,further exacerbating the socioeconomic repercussions of these disorders. METHODOLOGY :- A total of 147 participants were selected on the basis of inclusion and exclusion criteria. A consent form was filled by them and the study and questionnaire was explained to them.Self-made Questionnaire was explained to each gym instructors according to language understood by that person as well as google forms were also made available for their convenience.Each gym instructor completed a self administered questionnaire which included information regarding complaints of current shoulder pain. The total data was collected and was statistically analyzed. CONCLUSION :- The Prevalence of shoulder pain in gym instructors is high (78%). The presence of shoulder pain causes a gym instructors to avoid certain activities due to pain which causes a hindrance in their work related activities.",

      "abstract": "A strong and specific link between obsessive-compulsive disorder or symptoms (OCD/S) and a tendency for dissociative experiences (e.g., depersonalization-derealization, absorption and imaginative involvement) cannot be explained by trauma and is poorly understood. The present theoretical formulation proposes five different models conceptualizing the relationship. According to Model 1, dissociative experiences result from OCD/S through inward-focused attention and repetition. According to Model 2, dissociative absorption causally brings about both OCD/S and associated cognitive risk factors, such as thought-action fusion, partly through impoverished sense of agency. The remaining models highlight common underlying causal mechanisms: temporo-parietal abnormalities impairing embodiment and sensory integration (Model 3); sleep alterations causing sleepiness and dreamlike thought or mixed sleep-wake states (Model 4); and a hyperactive, intrusive imagery system with a tendency for pictorial thinking (Model 5). The latter model relates to Maladaptive Daydreaming, a suggested dissociative syndrome with strong ties to the obsessive-compulsive spectrum. These five models point to potential directions for future research, as these theoretical accounts may aid the two fields in interacting with each other, to the benefit of both. Finally, several dissociation-informed paths for further developing clinical intervention in OCD are identified.",

It is generally assumed that these subjects are quite helpless and that they suffer general deterioration. This is at variance with results of training and rehabilitation during which many thus affected subjects become independent, which is essential for their social integration. Despite this they have to experience sociopsychological attitudes which are prejudices with a typical stereotype which ignore the unique structure of everybody's potential who lost eyesight. The source of prejudices is general lack of information of people as regards actual sequelae of loss of eyesight and the emotional reaction of people with normal eyesight. A certain part is also played by tradition which does not take into account results of modern care of thus affected subjects. Prejudices cause in subjects with severely affected eyesight and in blind persons mental stress and render their actual social integration (employment, partnership etc.) more difficult. The solution is to train resistance against prejudices in thus affected subjects and to intensify health education on the given problem.",

The behavioral pattern of many epilepsy patients differs from that of age-, sex-, and socioeconomic-matched control subjects. Patients with TLE and other forms of epilepsy can experience changes in cognitive function, personality, affect, and drive-related behavior (e.g., libido, aggression). Biologic factors (e.g., underlying brain pathology, epileptogenic process, localization and lateralization, recurrent seizures, family history), antiepileptic drugs, and psychosocial factors interact pathogenically. Their roles vary among patients and among different neurobehavioral disorders. Behavioral changes occur in some epilepsy patients. However, the question of whether specific behavioral changes occur with different seizure types or epilepsy syndromes remains unanswered. For example, behavioral changes can occur in patients with absence epilepsy, juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, frontal lobe epilepsy, and tonic-clonic seizures. Many of these behavioral changes overlap with features of the purported TLE syndrome. We lack a clear delineation of the spectrum, frequency, and severity of changes in well-characterized partial and primary generalized epilepsy syndromes. Furthermore, the relative roles and the interplay among pathogenic factors remain poorly defined.",

      "abstract": "Difficulty in walking is a major feature of neurological disease, and loss of mobility is the activity of daily living on which patients place the most value.1 Consequently, how to measure and assess this is of importance to any member of the inter-disciplinary team. In clinical practice, the World Health Organization international classification of functioning (ICF)2 is often adopted as the underlying framework for the assessment of mobility, which is an individual's ability to move about effectively in their environment.2 The ICF also introduces the constructs of performance (what an individual does in his environment) and capacity (ability to execute a task or action). This has a clear impact on the current methodology for the assessment of mobility.\n\nDifferent pathologies and impairments culminate in abnormal or reduced walking. For instance, in multiple sclerosis (MS), impairments such as weakness and spasticity from pyramidal tract lesions, loss of proprioception and co-ordination from dorsal column and cerebellar lesions, vestibular and visual dysfunction, cognitive and mood disturbance and pain may all contribute (Figure 1). In primary muscle disease, mobility is determined by weakness but secondary factors such as weight gain, contractures, fatigue and breathlessness may have important impacts. The degree of impairment has a non-linear relationship with activity and participation. For example leg strength and walking speed are poorly correlated,3 while many personal and environmental factors may influence the impact of similar degrees of loss of walking on mobility. Figure 1. \nFramework of international classification of function (ICF) as illustrated by mobility in MS.\n\n\n\nImpaired walking can be a marker of both disability and disease progression, and is therefore an important outcome measure in the treatment and rehabilitation of diseases such as MS and Parkinson's disease (PD). In some cases, measurement of mobility may have a direct influence on access to treatment. … \n\nAddress correspondence to Dr O.R.

Only the former type can be treated by psychoanalytic psychotherapy. In the childhood of both types, one may find traumatic family environments which will result in social withdrawal (Hikikomori). In the infancy of the NSPO type, the mother fails to function as a sufficient container of the child's emotion, which encourages formation of a schizoid personality organization i.e. the psychic withdrawal (or \"psychic retreat\" by Steiner, J.). With only a little failure in life events, this may turn into a physical withdrawal for a long time. And in this type of pathology their aggression takes a passive form that hardens their social withdrawal situation. Moreover, the social withdrawal itself serves to reinforce the pathological narcissism.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Circadian rhythms define the near-24-hour oscillations observed in physiological processes. Circadian rhythm disorders result when there is a misalignment between an individual’s physiological rhythm and the environment. This can result from an intrinsic inability to entrain with the external environment, or from environmental demands that force desynchrony (e.g., shift work). This chapter will provide an overview of the currently recognized circadian rhythm sleep–wake disorders: delayed sleep–wake phase disorder, advanced sleep–wake phase disorder, irregular sleep–wake rhythm disorder, non-24-hour sleep–wake rhythm disorder, shift work disorder, and jet lag disorder. The chapter also provides a discussion of current treatment recommendations.",

      "title": "Body Dysmorphic Disorder",
      "abstract": "Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is a common (lifetime prevalence of about 2%; Buhlmann et al. 2010) and often severe disorder whose core feature is preoccupation with one or more nonexistent or slight defects in one's physical appearance. The preoccupation causes clinically significant distress or impairment in psychosocial functioning, and it is not better explained by concerns with body fat or weight in an individual who meets diagnostic criteria for an eating disorder (American Psychiatric Association 2013) (see Box 22- ). Insight regarding the perceived flaws (e.g., \"I look ugly\") is usually absent or poor; most individuals are completely or mostly convinced that their view of their perceived deformities is accurate (Phillips et al. 2012). All persons with BDD, at some point during the illness, perform compulsive behaviors aimed at checking, fixing, hiding, or obtaining reassurance about the perceived appearance defects (Phillips et al. 2005a). BDD is characterized by poor psychosocial functioning and high rates of suicidality (Buhlmann et al. 2010; Phillips et al. 2005b, 2008; Veale et al. 1996a), yet BDD usually goes undiagnosed in clinical settings (Conroy et al. 2008; Grant et al. 2001). DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Body Dysmorphic Disorder 300.7 F45.22 Preoccupation with one or more perceived defects or flaws in physical appearance that are not observable or appear slight to others. At some point during the course of the disorder, the individual has performed repetitive behaviors (e.g., mirror checking, excessive grooming, skin picking, reassurance seeking) or mental acts (e.g., comparing his or her appearance with that of others) in response to the appearance concerns. The preoccupation causes clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The appearance preoccupation is not better explained by concerns with body fat or weight in an individual whose symptoms meet diagnostic criteria for an eating disorder. Specify if: With muscle dysmorphia: The individual is preoccupied with the idea that his or her body build is too small or insufficiently muscular. This specifier is used even if the individual is preoccupied with other body areas, which is often the case. Specify if: Indicate degree of insight regarding body dysmorphic disorder beliefs (e.g., \"I look ugly\" or \"I look deformed\"). With good or fair insight: The individual recognizes that the body dysmorphic disorder beliefs are definitely or probably not true or that they may or may not be true. With poor insight: The individual thinks that the body dysmorphic disorder beliefs are probably true. With absent insight/delusional beliefs: The individual is completely convinced that the body dysmorphic disorder beliefs are true. Believing that they look ugly or abnormal, many patients seek and receive cosmetic treatment. Studies from psychiatry settings have found that about two-thirds of patients with BDD receive surgery or dermatological, dental, or other cosmetic treatment for their perceived flaws (Crerand et al. 2005; Phillips et al. 2001a). In one study ( N = 250), only 7% of such treatments led to overall improvement in BDD (Phillips et al. 2001a), and in another study ( N = 200), only 4% of procedures improved overall BDD symptoms (Crerand et al. 2005). These outcome data are retrospective but concur with data from a small prospective study (Tignol et al. 2007). In a survey of cosmetic surgeons, 40% reported that a patient with BDD had threatened them legally or physically (Sarwer 2002). Such reports underscore the critical importance of diagnosing BDD and implementing psychiatric treatment. Before beginning treatment, it is important to lay essential groundwork, with the goal of engaging patients, establishing a therapeutic alliance, and instilling hope. Because most patients have poor or absent insight, they may doubt that they have BDD and that psychiatric treatment can help. Psychoeducation about BDD should be provided, including the fact that it is a common and treatable disorder. Patients may benefit from reading about BDD (e.g., Phillips 2009). Trying to convince or reassure patients with poor or absent insight that they look normal is usually ineffective (one cannot impose insight), and patients typically misinterpret comments about their appearance, even if positive or reassuring, in a negative way. On the other hand, it is important not to agree with patients' negative view of their appearance because this may be devastating to them. It is helpful to empathize with patients' feelings and to focus on the likelihood that psychiatric treatment will improve their distress, preoccupation, and functioning.",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCAO: A Sindrome Pos-Polio (SPP) trata-se de uma desordem neurologica de carater progressivo e degenerativo, porem lento, e sua etiologia ainda e hipotetica. Resulta do desgaste proveniente do excesso de uso, tambem chamado overuse, dos neuronios motores inferiores localizados proximos aos que ja foram degradados na fase aguda da Poliomielite. Dos sintomas os principais sao: fraqueza muscular associada a fadiga, a atrofia e a dor. As disfuncoes causadas pela SPP dificultam a realizacao das atividades ocupacionais diarias gerando assim uma carga excessiva de estresse e fadiga muscular, no geral, esses pacientes sao muito ativos e raramente descansam, refletindo diretamente nas atividades laborais e resultando em alteracoes psicologicas como isolamento e baixa autoestima. DESCRICAO DA EXPERIENCIA: O trabalho tem como objetivo verificar os beneficios produzidos por um protocolo de tratamento fisioterapeutico, realizado com o intuito de minimizar o quadro algico e de estresse desses individuos, como tambem maximizar a capacidade funcional (CF) e qualidade de vida (QV). Os encontros sao realizados uma vez por semana na Fundacao Centro Integrado de Apoio ao Portador de Deficiencia (FUNAD) em Joao Pessoa - PB, com duracao de sessenta minutos cada sessao. A priori foi realizada avaliacao fisioterapeutica e aplicacao de instrumentos de avaliacao da estresse, CF e QV. Os atendimentos sao realizados em grupo, composto por dez individuos cadeirantes e nao cadeirantes, com idades entre vinte e sessenta e cinco anos, de ambos os sexos que consiste em alongamento, fortalecimento e relaxamento muscular. Alem dos atendimentos semanais foram realizadas orientacoes para o autocuidado com exercicios de alongamento e relaxamento a serem realizados todos os dias. IMPACTOS: Apesar de ocorrerem apenas uma vez por semana, os atendimentos se mostraram eficazes apresentando resultados positivos que podem ser observados tanto na nossa percepcao como nos relatos dos proprios individuos: no inicio do ano eu estava muito mal, pensei ate que iria ficar sem andar, sentia muita dor e achava que nao ia conseguir voltar para o trabalho, depois dos atendimentos melhorei muito e ate minha autoestima aumentou, voces nao tem ideia de como esses exercicios nos ajudam na melhora da dor, saimos daqui outras pessoas, renovadas, hoje toco a cadeira com mais facilidade e quase sem dor, noto que a tensao do pescoco e bracos diminuiu, estou dormindo melhor e passo o dia me sentindo bem. . CONSIDERACOES FINAIS: A formacao do grupo nos proporcionou a oportunidade de aprender sobre uma patologia a qual nao tinhamos conhecimento, o que permitiu nos inteirar sobre as dificuldades biopsicossociais trazidas pela SPP, possibilitando refletir sobre esses impactos e a importância das intervencoes na vida dos pacientes. A melhora na dor ao termino de cada sessao e relatada por todo o grupo, o que repercute em todos os seus aspectos de vida, melhorando a CF, QV e consequentemente a reducao do estresse.",

      "title": "The pathology of torture",
      "abstract": "Detainees may be subjected to torture and extra-judicial execution by State actors and terrorists. But, the pathology of torture has not been well-described. This is due to the lack of autopsies performed on victims of torture, mostly due to the disposal of the bodies of the victims by their torturers. On this basis, the cause of death of detainees subjected to torture is often a matter of speculation or remains obscure. This paper provides an overview of the pathology of torture based on the authour's experience with the autopsies of torture victims. At autopsy, many different types of inflicted injuries may be observed, often ranging in severity. However, three recurrent patterns of trauma that are the hallmarks of torture were recognized by the authour: (1) blunt impact trauma characterized by bruises, patterned injuries, and internal injuries; (2) electrical and thermal injuries; and (3) injuries from stress positions that occur from prolonged suspension. The most under-recognized form of fatal torture are the complications of stress positions related to suspension of the victim's body by the upper, or lower extremities. For example, prolonged suspension by reverse hanging (suspension of the victim's body by the wrists or forearms with the arms extended backward at the shoulder joint) can cause over-stretching and necrosis of the muscles of the shoulder, resulting in fatal myoglobinuric renal failure. It is essential that autopsies be performed on all detainees who die in custody, to determine if torture played a role in death. Furthermore, the true nature of the injuries sustained often remains obscure unless a musculocutaneous dissection is performed. Specifically, dissection of the back, limbs and the soles of the feet, as well as the shoulders and knees is essential to determine if specific forms of torture have been applied. This is especially true for fatal complications of stress positions. Seeking the truth about the medical consequences of fatal torture will raise awareness about torture-related injuries, assist in rehabilitation of torture survivors, and strengthen forensic humanitarian action.",

One mogu utjecati na motoricki, kognitivni, bihevioralni razvoj, te na razvoj govora i ucenja, sa dugorocnim posljedicama. Rana identifikacija djece sa rizikom razvijanja neuromotornih poteskoca neophodna je za rani fizioterapijski pristup. Fizioterapijska intervencija, koja ima za cilj pozitivno modificirati prirodni tijek ovih poremecaja, osigurava pocetak svoje primjene vec u prvim tjednima i/ili mjesecima života. Genetske anomalije ili kongenitalne lezije mozga, ne moraju nužno biti odgovorni za pojavu neuromotornih poteskoca kod dojencadi. Stovise, okolina i iskustvo mogu modificirati razvoj mozga i poboljsati ishod u dojencadi koja su u riziku od nastanka neuromotornih poteskoca. Ova definicija svrstava u jednu grupu sirok spektar neuroloskih problema kao sto su: autizam, poremecaj pozornosti s hiperaktivnoscu (ADHD), epilepsija i cerebralna paraliza. Cerebralna paraliza je poremecaj pokreta i položaja uzrokovan neprogresivnim ostecenjem nezrelog mozga. Posljedice ostecenja utjecu na motoricku funkciju, misicno-kostani i kognitivni razvoj. Imajuci uvid u stanje problema, trebamo uzeti u obzir da cerebralna paraliza ne predstavlja samo medicinski problem, vec i socijalni i psiholoski problem. Habilitacija djece sa neuromotornim poteskocama veoma je bitna jer ona olaksava razvoj djeteta i pridonosi boljem rezultatu terapije i kvaliteti života. U habilitaciji djeteta sa cerebralnom paralizom neizostavna je suradnja strucnjaka razlicitih profesionalnih disciplina. Djeca sa cerebralnom paralizom i drugim neuromotornim poteskocama, edukacijom roditelja i dobivanjem uputa za provođenje terapijskih programa kod kuce dobivaju vježbe kako bi im pomogle u ostvarivanju fizioterapijskih ciljeva. Primjena kucnih programa može povoljno utjecati na daljnji razvoj djeteta s poteskocama. Veoma je bitno pridržavati se programa vježbanja jer je to neophodno za postizanje razine vježbi potrebne za postizanje ciljeva. Ukoliko se kucni programi pravilno primjenjuju, mogu poboljsati grube motoricke funkcije, pokrete ruku i sake, kao i brigu o sebi, komunikaciju i ponasanje djece sa cerebralnom paralizom.",

      "title": "Abnormal repetitive behaviours: shared phenomenology and pathophysiology",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Self‐injurious behaviour (SIB) is a devastating problem observed in individuals with various neurodevelopmental disorders, including specific genetic syndromes as well as idiopathic intellectual and developmental disability. Although an increased prevalence of SIB has been documented in specific genetic mutations, little is known about the neurobiological basis of SIB. This makes vulnerability assessment and pharmacological treatment incredibly challenging. Method Here we review evidence that SIB and other repetitive, invariant behaviours, such as stereotypy, compulsions and tics, share many phenotypic similarities, are often co‐morbidly expressed and have common inducing conditions. This argues for shared or overlapping pathophysiology. As much more is known about the neurobiology of these related disorders, this should make the neurobiology of SIB a more tractable problem. Results Stereotypy, compulsions and tics are diagnostic for disorders that have received focused neurobiological investigation (autism, obsessive compulsive disorder, Tourette syndrome, respectively). In addition, animal models of these repetitive behaviours have been well characterised. Collectively, these studies have found that cortical basal ganglia circuitry dysfunction mediates repetitive behaviour. Moreover, these studies provide more detailed information and potentially testable hypotheses about specific aspects of the circuitry that may be operative in SIB. Conclusions We can use available information from clinical and animal models to make more precise hypotheses regarding the particular pathophysiology driving SIB. The results of testing such hypotheses should generate pharmacological strategies that may prove efficacious in reducing SIB.",

Myoclonic or tremulous movements are often superimposed in CD, producing a “tremor like” appearance – especially early in the disease state. The terms CD and spasmodic torticollis are not interchangeable: CD is the preferred term when referring to idiopathic focal dystonia of the neck. Spasmodic torticollis is now considered to be one of four types of CD. Cervical dystonia is classified into four types based on the principal direction of head posture: torticollis (abnormal rotation of the head to the right or to the left in the transverse plane); laterocollis (the head tilts toward the right or left shoulder); anterocollis (the head pulls forward with neck flexion); and retrocollis (the head pulls back with the neck hyperextended).",

      "abstract": "regoli delusion, first described by Courbon and Fail in 1927, named after an Italian actor Leopoldo Fregoli, is a rare delusional misidentification syndrome which entails that different people are in fact the same person in disguise who is able to change their appearance [1]. It is commonly linked to schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and other organic brain syndromes including head trauma, ischaemic strokes, AD, Parkinson’s disease, epilepsy or metabolic derangements [2]. Neurologically, it represents a disconnectivity syndrome of hyperidentification (cf. Capgras) [3]. As TBI sequelae, psychotic symptoms may occur early or late [4]. In the early postinjury period, psychotic symptoms are most commonly manifestations of post-traumatic delirium. In the late postinjury period, these symptoms may be either part of a schizophrenia-like psychosis, comprising predominantly persecutory delusions, auditory hallucinations and dearth of negative symptoms, or be associated features of a mood disorder. The best available epidemiological evidence suggests that TBI confers a modest increased risk for schizophrenia-like psychosis especially if coupled with a positive family history of psychosis and male gender [5]. TBI renders patients more susceptible to neurologic side effects of antipsychotics [6].Here, we are reporting an adolescent with TBI that later on developed Fregoli delusions. He had supersensitivity to multiple antipsychotic trials with no response at all. When shifted to low-dose clozapine, delusions entirely remitted with great tolerability. A 15-year-old Palestinian youngster was casualty petitioned in accompaniment of his parents for paranoid ideations of 3 months duration.

      "abstract": "IntroductionThe impact of accidents is important both for younger and older people.We live in a multisensory environment and the interaction between our genes and the environment shapes our brains.Cortical blindness as a result of head trauma (to the brain's occipital cortex) is a rare phenomenon and can be a total or partial loss of vision in a normal-appearing eye.How patients will adjust to the loss of vision and its consequences might be a challenge let along if they have mobility imparement (tetraplegia) as well.Adaptation and reintegration of patients into society after motor recovery in the context of visual sensory deficit.TBI survivors themselves and their families are likely more interested in quality-of-life outcomes, such as reintegration into the community, successful return to work or school, and functional capacity in everyday life.Cognitive and behavioural changes, difficulties maintaining personal relationships and coping with school and work are reported by survivors as more disabling than any residual physical deficits.As with all rehabilitation, the goal is to help the person achieve the maximum degree of return to their previous level of functioning. Case presentationHaving the patient and TEHBA Bioethics Committee aproval, we will present the evolution of a case with postraumatic spastic tetraplegia post severe traumatic brain injury, blindness post traumatic bilateral occipital lesions and psycho-cognitive syndrome.Clinical and paraclinical aspects will be discussed (patient history and clinical examination, results of imaging and laboratory tests, the neuromioartrokinetic exam, specific rating scales, both medical and kinetotherapeutic treatments).We will address the case in terms of particularities and treatment approach (neurorehabilation of a motor deficit in the context of a major sensory deficiency) and evolution during hospitalization. ConclusionsTrauma has been known to result in cortical blindness but the exact pathophysiology remains unknown and remains a matter of continued debate.Cortical blindness may occur after trauma, however, most cases regardless of etiology, are reversible and have no long term sequelae.While TBI can cause long-term physical disability, it is the complex neurobehavioural sequelae that produce the greatest disruption to quality of life.As with all rehabilitation, the goal is to help the person achieve the maximum degree of return to their previous level of functioning.In the setting of polytrauma, a careful ophthalmologic and neurologic examination of the trauma patient, together with a high index of suspicion, is necessary for the diagnosis of this condition.Heightened awareness of the causes should be followed with appropriate imaging and management.",

This is referred to as a culture-related specific psychiatric disorder or a culture-bound syndrome (CBS). The occurrence of intense anxiety associated with the fear that the penis will shrink into the abdomen. resulting in death. is a unique psychopathology observed mainly in the South Asia region and is known as koro (impotence panic). It may occur as an epidemic (Tseng et al., 1988). involving several thousand victims within a short period of time. It is closely related to the local people's belief that the shrinking of the penis is a sign of the fatal exhausting of the yang element (Mo et al., 1995). Koro, as well as other kinds of unique psychopathology. such as malgri (territorial anxiety syndrome) (Cawte, 1976). or amok (nondiscriminatory massive homocide) (Westermeyer. 1973) are classic examples of specific culture-related disorders observed only among certain peoples in their cultural settings.",

      "title": "Assessing Mild Traumatic Brain Injury",
      "abstract": "Abstract Mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI) accounts for approximately 80% of the estimated 373000 traumatic brain injuries that occur annually in the United States. MTBI typically occurs in males 15 to 24 years of age, and postconcussional sequelae may impede physical, emotional, social, marital, vocational, and avocational functioning. Usually the severity of the initial neurologic injury is defined according to the Glasgow Coma Score, the presence and duration of amnesia (retrograde and anterograde), and the alteration of loss of consciousness and its duration. MTBI is a traumatically induced physiological disruption of cerebral function manifested by at least one of the following: loss of consciousness no longer than 20 minutes; any loss of memory; any alteration in mental status at the time of the accident; physical symptoms that potentially are related to the brain; and development of posttraumatic cognitive deficits not accounted for by emotional factors. When a patient presents with multisystem trauma, impairments may involve several parts of the body, including the nervous system. Individual impairments of other systems should be calculated separately and their whole person values combined using the Combined Values Chart in AMA Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment . At present, no ideal system can rate impairment following MTBI, and physicians must thoroughly understand both the underlying disease process and the associated injuries.",

      "abstract": "Objective: Psychoanalytic theories of the mind emerged in the immediate post-Darwinian era of the 1880s and 1890s. Since that time much has changed in both psychoanalytic and evolutionary theorizing. This paper explores recent evolutionary thinking on psychopathology. Method: Relevant literature was reviewed. Results: This paper outlines some of the common behavioural defence mechanisms and then explores ways in which they are represented in various disorders, with a focus on depression. This paper suggests that ‘symptoms’ can be related to the activation of evolved defence mechanisms to respond to losses and threats. Such will involve, for example, anxious arousal and heightened vigilance and attention to the threat, with the type of defence (e.g. fight, flight, submit, help seeking) being mirrored in particular symptom presentations. Conclusion: Defences can become pathological when they are too easily aroused or prolonged, are arrested (aroused but not expressed) and/or ineffective.",

A personality disorder is “an enduring pattern of inner experience and behavior that deviates markedly from expectations of the individual's culture, is pervasive and inflexible, has an onset in adolescence or early adulthood, is stable over time and leads to distress of impairment” (American Psychiatric Association [APA], 1994). Dangerous behaviors (i.e., violence or suicide attempts) are mostly found among individuals with personality disorders included in Cluster B Category: Antisocial, Borderline, Histrionic, and Narcissistic Personality Disorders. Individuals with Cluster B Personality Disorders often appear dramatic, emotional, and/or erratic. Individuals with Paranoid Personality Disorder, which is in Cluster A, talk about violence but are usually not violent (Tardiff, 1998). The other personality disorders in Cluster A, Schizoid and Schizotypal Personality Disorders, and those in Cluster C (Avoidant, Dependent, and Obsessive Compulsive Personality Disorders) are not dangerous although occasionally violent or suicidal behaviors may occur if they feel angry or depressed or have an accompanying Axis I disorder, which is linked to violent or suicidal behavior. Some individuals with mental retardation are violent as a consequence of frustration and an inability to express themselves verbally.This chapter will focus on personality disorders in Cluster B and Paranoid Personality Disorder, since these are the most frequent and challenging cases where the clinician must decide whether the patient is a short-term risk for violence or suicidal behavior.",

In a vulnerable adolescent, a stressful developmental event may trigger a pathological response--acute anxiety, depression with or without suicidal ideation or behavior, severe conduct disturbance, a first psychotic episode, or explosive or violent behavior--that requires emergency psychiatric treatment. The basic components of an emergency psychiatric evaluation of an adolescent include initial observation of the patient, taking a history, interviewing the patient and others accompanying the patient, conducting a mental status examination, making a diagnosis, and planning for disposition and further treatment. Such an evaluation may be the first contact with the mental health system for many adolescents, and the intervention of a sensitive clinician may help the adolescent be more comfortable seeking mental health care in the future.",

      "abstract": "Psychosocial factors affect resistance to a wide variety of diseases in animals. Stimuli often assumed to be noxious (e.g., electric shock, isolation housing) have been found to exert either potentiating or protective effects on an animal's response to potentially pathogenic stimulation. This variability has often been attributed to the influences of these stimuli on aspects of neuroendocrine or immunological function which are related to specific forms of pathogenic stimulation. The impact of a particular form of stimulation on the physiological state of the organism is also determined by the ability of the animal to cope with the stimulus environment. Factors shown to influence have included: (a) other aspects of the immediate environment at the time of stimulation; (b) prior experience with the same or other forms of stimulation; (c) the animal's ability to control its relationship to the stimuli by learning to escape or avoid them; (d) the availablility of relevant feedback regarding stimulus onset (e.g., warning signal), and (e) the stage of the disease process at which stimulation is imposed. These findings by various investigators indicate that it may be inappropriate to place a priori value judgements on any form of psychosocial stimulation or stress either as conceptually or operationally defined. The adaptive value of the psychosocial environment will depend upon its perception by the animal, the animal's ability to cope with the stimulus environment, and the particular disease system being studied.",

      "title": "Aspectos psicológicos y neuropsicológicos de la esclerosis múltiple",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCCION\nLa Esclerosis Multiple (EM) es una enfermedad de naturaleza desmielinizante y curso cronico, cuya base anatomopatologica se caracteriza por un proceso de destruccion de las vainas de mielina que recubren los axones neuronales (manifestandose en forma de lesiones distribuidas extensamente en el parenquima cerebral y la medula espinal), lo que propiciaria una alteracion en los mecanismos sinapticos y la emergencia de los sintomas caracteristicos de la misma. Se trata de una neuropatologia que se diagnostica habitualmente al final de la segunda decada de la vida o inicio de la tercera, con una prevalencia superior entre las mujeres (2:1). Supone, ademas, una de las principales causas de discapacidad en este periodo etario. \nA nivel sintomatologico se aprecia una clinica diversa en la que predomina el compromiso sensomotriz, acompanado con cierta frecuencia de perdidas en otras areas de relevancia clinica y humana (vision, funcion vesical/intestinal, estabilidad postural, fatiga o dolor; entre otros). La evolucion es generalmente en forma de brotes periodicos (85%), seguidos de un periodo de remision/estabilidad tras el cual pueden prevalecer sintomas residuales (cuyo efecto acumulativo genera discapacidad con el devenir del tiempo). Ocasionalmente este proceso se presenta de modo continuo, tanto desde el inicio de la enfermedad (EM primaria progresiva) como tras algunos anos de convivencia con el subtipo bifasico (EM secundaria progresiva), momento en el que la EM constituye un reto terapeutico todavia mayor. \nLa literatura sobre esta patologia evidencia la presencia de resonancias en el area de la salud mental de estos pacientes (presencia de sintomas depresivos, deterioro de la calidad de vida, compromiso de la funcion cognitiva, etc.), que requieren la puesta en marcha de recursos diagnosticos y terapeuticos especificos dirigidos a su deteccion y abordaje clinico.\n OBJETIVO\nLa presente tesis doctoral tiene como proposito principal evaluar a un grupo de pacientes con diagnostico de EM en una serie de variables sociodemograficas, clinicas, psicologicas y neuropsicologicas; con el fin de explorar las relaciones que se establecen entre todas ellas y detectar las necesidades asistenciales de este colectivo en el ambito de la salud mental.\n METODO\nSe opto por un diseno descriptivo y transversal, de corte correlacional. Se incluyo un grupo control (personas sin evidencia de la enfermedad), de tamano equivalente al clinico (n=55 en ambos casos). Tras una profunda revision de la literatura, se procedio a la construccion de una bateria de evaluacion dirigida a la exploracion de las siguientes variables: estres (Escala de Sucesos Vitales Estresantes -SVEAD), afrontamiento (Cuestionario de Estilos de Afrontamiento -COPE), apoyo social (Cuestionario Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey -MOS-SSS), personalidad (Cuestionario de Personalidad de Eysenck Revisado -EPQ-R), sintomas psicologicos (Cuestionario Revisado de Sintomas Psicologicos -SCL-90-R), calidad de vida (Cuestionario Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life 54 -MSQOL-54), dolor (West Haven-Yale Multidimensional Pain Inventory -WHYMPI) y funcion cognitiva (Bateria Neuropsicologica Breve -BNB y Trail Making Test -TMT). Para la evaluacion de las variables sociodemograficas se diseno una entrevista ad hoc.\nEl analisis de los datos contemplo estrategias de comparacion de medias, analisis multivariados (discriminante), analisis correlacionales y analisis de mediacion; ademas del calculo de los correspondientes tamanos del efecto. Adicionalmente, se exploro la consistencia interna de todos los factores sometidos a estudio.\n RESULTADOS\nDe las diferencias obtenidas entre los pacientes y la poblacion general (de las que se infieren las necesidades asistenciales) se concluye: un malestar emocional mas intenso, una erosion pronunciada de la calidad de vida, un apoyo social deficitario, un perfil de personalidad que implica vulnerabilidad para la psicopatologia, un estres acentuado y un uso mas frecuente del afrontamiento emocional. Paralelamente, el analisis discriminante extrae las dimensiones que permiten una mejor diferenciacion entre los grupos, asi como su correspondiente capacidad de clasificacion.\nSe confirma, asimismo, el papel modulador de determinadas circunstancias sobrevenidas (discapacidad, estres percibido, experiencia de un brote reciente y problemas para dormir) sobre un amplio abanico de dimensiones psicologicas y neuropsicologicas, evidenciandose la configuracion de patrones especificos de expresion en casa caso. Tambien se corrobora el papel mediador del apoyo social en la relacion que se establece entre la discapacidad y el malestar emocional, asi como la capacidad de mediacion del afrontamiento orientado a la emocion y el neuroticismo en la asociacion entre el estres y las variables de resultado (sintomas psicologicos y calidad de vida). Por ultimo, se detallan las interacciones entre las variables contempladas en el estudio, de modo que puedan discernirse las relaciones de covariacion que se establecen entre todas ellas en aras de una comprension mas profunda de la experiencia interna del paciente.\n CONCLUSION\nLa EM es una enfermedad compleja, que presenta un evidente impacto sobre la salud mental de la persona que la sufre. La presente tesis doctoral extrae algunas de las principales necesidades asistenciales (incluyendo el modo en que determinadas circunstancias sobrevenidas durante el proceso de enfermedad pueden modular la experiencia subjetiva del paciente) y explora las interacciones entre variables de relevancia clinica (incluyendose las relaciones con el deterioro cognitivo), de modo que pueda incrementarse el conocimiento disponible sobre la enfermedad desde la perspectiva de la salud mental. Los analisis de mediacion determinan que tanto el apoyo social como el estilo de afrontamiento emocional (dos dimensiones susceptibles de abordaje terapeutico) tienen un importante papel explicativo en la relacion que se objetiva entre la discapacidad y el estres con la sintomatologia psicologica y la calidad de vida. \nLos resultados obtenidos permiten incrementar el conocimiento actual sobre los aspectos psicologicos y neuropsicologicos de la EM, y ofrecer herramientas para el diseno de un plan de tratamiento orientado a este colectivo.",
