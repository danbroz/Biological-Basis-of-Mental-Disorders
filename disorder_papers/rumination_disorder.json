      "title": "Feeding Disability In Children",
      "abstract": "Feeding disability in children is termed as a pediatric inadequacy to take food and includes disorders resulting in delayed development of milestones, inappropriate weight gain, and/or failure to thrive. Feeding disorder may present as a child refusing to eat a certain group of foods or a specific food element class. The child can manifest with crying, vomiting, choking, or spitting up during feeds. It requires a comprehensive assessment of medical, psychosocial, feeding skill-based systems and associated nutritional based complications. Gastrointestinal disturbance in children with neurodisability (e.g., cerebral palsy) reflects the interplay between the central nervous system (CNS) and the enteric nervous system (ENS), resulting in a mandatory comprehensive review of child pathology. Feeding disability is acute when the duration is less than three months and chronic when greater than three months have elapsed.",

      "title": "Bulimia nervosa: literature review",
      "abstract": "Daniella Meytin1 1Lithuanian University of Health Sciences, Academy of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine Abstract Bulimia nervosa is one of the most common eating disorders. The disease manifests in episodes of binge eating, accompanied by attempts to get rid of the food eaten by vomiting, taking laxatives, exercising, or reducing food and calorie intake during other meals, along with excessive concerns, regarding weight and appearance. The disease is more common in the Western culture, among women, especially among younger aged (usually beginning in late adolescence). The onset of the disease is influenced by biological and environmental factors. Due to laxative use, hypokalemia and arrhythmias may develop; due to vomiting – enamel damage and voice changes. Bulimia nervosa is diagnosed, if, during the last 3 months, the patient had at least 1 episode of binge eating per week, accompanied by compensatory actions (vomiting, taking laxatives, exercising, or reducing food and calorie intake during other meals). Treatment is started with psychotherapy, if it does not help or the patient is additionally diagnosed with depression, SSRI or SNRI treatment is added. 80% of treated patients achieve remission of the disease. Aim: to determine the epidemiology, etiology, symptoms, diagnostics, treatment, and prognosis of bulimia nervosa. Methods: a systematic review of the literature was performed using the PubMed medical database. Selected articles examining the etiology, epidemiology, symptoms, diagnostics, treatment, and prognosis of bulimia nervosa. English word combinations were used for search: bulimia nervosa, eating disorder, bulimia, bulimia diagnostics, bulimia treatment. Conclusions: after systematic literature review was conducted, the epidemiology, etiology, symptoms, diagnostics, treatment, and prognosis of bulimia nervosa were presented. Keywords: bulimia nervosa, eating disorders, bulimia, psychiatry.",

      "title": "Feeding and swallowing dysfunction in genetic syndromes",
      "abstract": "Abstract Children with genetic syndromes frequently have feeding problems and swallowing dysfunction as a result of the complex interactions between anatomical, medical, physiological, and behavioral factors. Feeding problems associated with genetic disorders may also cause feeding to be unpleasant, negative, or even painful because of choking, coughing, gagging, fatigue, or emesis, resulting in the child to stop eating and to develop behaviors that make it difficult, if not impossible, for a parent to feed their child. In addition, limited experiences with oral intake related to the medical or physical conditions, or other variables such as prematurity, often result in a failure of the child's oral motor skills to develop normally. For example, a child with Pierre Robin sequence may be unable to successfully feed orally, initially, due to micrognathia and glossoptosis. Oral‐motor dysfunction may develop as a result of both anatomical problems, (e.g., cleft lip/palate), lack of experience (e.g., s/p. surgery), or oral motor abnormalities (e.g., brain malformation). Neuromotor coordination impairments such as those associated with Down syndrome (e.g., hypotonia, poor tongue control, and open mouth posture) frequently interfere with the acquisition of effective oral‐motor skills and lead to feeding difficulties. Management of these phenomena is frequently possible, if an appropriate feeding plan exist that allows for three primary factors: (1) feeding program must be safe, (2) feeding program must support optimal growth, and (3) feeding program must be realistic. Researchers have demonstrated the utility of behavioral approaches in the treatment of feeding disorders, such as manipulations in the presentation of foods and drink and consequences for food refusal and acceptance (e.g., praise, extinction, contingent access to preferred foods). However, because a child's failure to eat is not frequently the result of a single cause, evaluation and treatment are typically conducted by an interdisciplinary team usually consisting of a behavioral psychologist, pediatric gastroenterologist, speech pathologist, nutrition, and sometimes other disciplines. This chapter provides an overview of some of the feeding difficulties experience by some of the more common genetic disorders including identification, interventions, and management. © 2008 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.

      "abstract": "Constipation is a common functional problem of the digestive system and may occur secondary to diet, drugs, endocrine diseases, metabolic diseases, neurological diseases, psychiatric disorders, or gastrointestinal obstruction. When there is no secondary cause, constipation is diagnosed as functional constipation. The first steps that should be taken to relieve symptoms are diet and lifestyle modifications, and if unsuccessful, laxative therapy should be initiated. If a patient does not respond to laxative therapy, diagnostic anorectal physiological tests are performed, though they are not routinely recommended. However, these tests may be considered earlier in patients strongly suspected to have a defecatory disorder. The revised guideline on the diagnosis and treatment of chronic constipation will undoubtedly aid the individualized management of chronic constipation in clinical practice.",

      "title": "Food Refusal: A Sign of Nausea?",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Food refusal and failure to thrive are serious problems in young children. When accompanied by ejection of previously swallowed food, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) is often suspected. The rationale is that reflux oesophagitis causes pain related to feedings and avoidance of feeds occurs in order to minimize the unpleasant experience (1). Such children, although hungry and eager to take the bottle at the beginning of the meal, subsequently become unsettled and irritable and push the bottle away. They often improve with anti-reflux measures such as antacids or histamine2 receptor antagonists (2). Another potential cause of food refusal and ejection of feeds is the nausea and vomiting caused by activation of the emetic reflex. Activation of the emetic reflex is associated with autonomic prodromal symptoms such as nausea, followed by retching and vomiting caused by forceful contraction of the diaphragm and anterior abdominal wall muscles (2). In this situation, food refusal might be an indicator of antecedent nausea. This possibility was investigated in the current study by examining the relationship between food refusal and symptoms of the emetic reflex. METHODS We used a structured interview in a prospective study of children scheduled for fundoplication to record symptoms associated with feeding and vomiting. The study included 20 neurologically impaired (age range, 3 months–8 years) and 11 neurologically normal (age range, 3 months—4 years) patients. The presence or absence of food refusal (distinct from dysphagia) was recorded in each patient. The children were divided into two groups according to whether their vomiting symptoms were typical of GORD (Group A: effortless regurgitation and/or possetting) or typical of activation of the emetic reflex (Group B: retching and forceful emesis). Groups were compared using Fisher exact test. RESULTS Pre-operatively, food refusal was more common in Group B than Group A and there was a significant association between food refusal and retching (Table 1, P < 0.01). The presence of preoperative food refusal was a strong predictor of postoperative retching in that 9 of 11 food refusers retched after fundoplication compared with 5 of 20 nonrefusers (P < 0.01).TABLE 1: The presence of symptoms of retching and of food refusal in a group of 31 children (20 neurologically impaired and 11 neurologically normal). There is a significant association between food refusal and retching, p < 0.01DISCUSSION Retching is caused by activation of the emetic reflex and usually is preceded by nausea and other autonomic prodromal features such as sweating and pallor due to peripheral vasoconstriction (2). Nausea is a very unpleasant sensation (2), perhaps a more aversive experience even than pain (3). Nausea is part of the defensive role of the emetic reflex. It facilitates the conditioning that results in subsequent avoidance of foods that previously caused illness. The role of learned food aversion is particularly apparent in animals unable to vomit, such as the rat. This conditioned food avoidance makes the rat a difficult animal to poison (2). Many chemotherapeutic agents used to treat malignancies are strongly emetogenic. Their repeated administration to children or adults in association with food may render those foods unpalatable to the patient. Such conditioning may result in specific food refusal behaviors (4,5). Young children and the neurologically impaired are unable to verbalize their feelings and experiences. Instead, in a fashion similar to experimental animals (6), they change their behavior in response to negative experiences. They avoid what they perceive to be the stimulus for nausea by refusing feedings. They may become distressed when they see specific foods prepared and may have an aversion to the bottle. The behavior is easily misinterpreted as oppositional or lazy. Many children with chronic vomiting have features such as sweating, pallor, and retching suggesting that their symptoms are in fact caused by activation of the emetic reflex and not by the regurgitation of GORD (7). It follows that such children would not improve with medical antireflux therapy and many indeed receive antireflux surgery. Fundoplication may physically prevent vomiting, but the emetic reflex is still activated and these children may continue to retch postoperatively (7). Food refusal may be difficult to identify in severely neurologically impaired children, and its incidence underestimated because of other factors such as dysphagia. However, it may still be apparent to careful observers. We recall the mother of an infant with spastic quadriplegia who described her child as \"only happy when she is being fasted for a test.\" The child's retching and vomiting improved following treatment with the anti-emetic metoclopramide. A previous retrospective study of 600 children younger than 2 years with GORD reported that 25 had food refusal Thirteen of these had fundoplications to control vomiting (8). The prevalence of oesophagitis was no greater in the refusers than in nonrefusers, but all the food refusers experienced postoperative retching, implying that the emetic reflex was activated and suggesting that food refusal was a consequence of nausea caused by activation of the emetic reflex rather than pain from oesophagitis. This study is consistent with our findings of an association between food refusal and retching after fundoplication. The association between food refusal and retching suggests that, in these children, food refusal in association with the ejection of gastric contents may be a consequence of activation of the emetic reflex and nausea, rather than a consequence of GORD and oesophagitis. Unpleasant experiences after food ingestion may lead to food avoidance. The response to nausea is qualitatively different from other noxious experiences in both humans and animals. It results in food/taste aversion (rather than simple avoidance), whereas heartburn (a classic symptom of GORD), bloating, and electric shock do not. Food aversion is a behavior which takes much longer to extinguish (3). A single pairing of a food with a nauseating experience has been shown sufficient to produce aversion (5,9) that may persist for years. These observations have implications for management. These children may not be helped by antireflux medication or by antireflux surgery. Surgery may in fact make make symptoms worse because the children can no longer vomit. They may not be cured by behavioral therapy, and tube feeds may accentuate nausea and exacerbate symptoms. Investigation may show that some of them have a treatable cause for their emesis (e.g., cow's milk protein intolerance). In others, a specific cause will not be found. Some may have a form of functional dyspepsia or visceral afferent hypersensitivity. Others (especially the overtly neurologically impaired), may have a central nervous system disturbance (e.g., loss or dysfunction of central inhibitory emetic pathways). The treatment for these children should be anti-emetic strategies (7). Acknowledgments: The authors thank Professor Spitz and Professor Milla for permission to report their patients.",

These should be investigated first. But if the degree or rate of decline raises suspicion for cognitive deterioration, it is prudent to consider the possibility that a neurologic condition may be presenting insidiously. Particularly if the symptoms seem progressive or there is involvement of other organ systems, further evaluation is warranted. Visual abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, and liver involvement are among the symptoms commonly associated with some neurodegenerative disorders. Clinical course is important to consider, as a relapsing course will be more suggestive of an inflammatory/autoimmune etiology. A progressive course is more concerning for metabolic disorders, including leukodystrophies.",

      "title": "[Nighttime eating disorders--clinical symptoms and treatment].",
      "abstract": "Nighttime eating is categorized as either night eating syndrome (NES) or the sleep-related eating disorder (SRED). Both diseases are often connected with an increase of the body mass, obesity, and with psychiatric disturbances. NES is characterized by evening hyperphagia, abnormally increased food intake after the evening meal, nocturnal awakings with ingestions, morning anorexia, and insomnia. Patients suffering from NES are aware of their nocturnal ingestions. It is suggested that NES is an abnormality in the circadian rhythm of meal timing that occurs in people with normal circadian rhythm of sleep. Other factors underlying NES include genetic predispositions, hormonal and neurochemical disturbances, and mood disorders. SRED is characterized by recurrent episodes of eating or drinking after arousal from nighttime sleep, unaware in tight the most cases, with adverse consequences. The distinctive features of SRED are amnesia of night eating episodes and consumption of non-typical food or dangerous articles. SRED is frequently associated with other sleep disorders, e.g., restless leg syndrome, periodic limb movement disorder, obstructive sleep apnea, and somnambulism. It can be also induced by medicines applied by a patient (e.g. zolpidem). It is hypothesized that the syndrome represents a variation of somnambulism. In the treatment of NES both non-pharmacological methods (psychotherapy, phototherapy) as well as the pharmacotherapy (aimed to increase serotoninergic neurotransmission in the brain, predominantly by sertraline, a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor) are used. SRED can be treated by controlling comorbid sleep disorders and eliminating provocative sedative hypnotics.",

It is considered one of the most complex sensorimotor functions because of the high level of coordination needed to accomplish the swallowing task over a very short period of 1-2s and the multiple subsystems it involves. Dysphagia (i.e., swallowing difficulties) refers to any swallowing disorder and is commonly caused by a variety of neurological conditions (e.g., stroke, cerebral palsy, Parkinson disease), head and neck cancer and its treatment, genetic syndromes, and iatrogenic conditions or trauma. The signs and symptoms of dysphagia range from anterior loss of food while eating, difficulty chewing, and subjective difficulty swallowing food or liquids to choking or coughing before, during, or after eating because of impaired clearance of swallowed material from the throat into the digestive system. When not effectively treated, dysphagia can cause malnutrition, dehydration, immune system failure, psychosocial degradation, and generally decreased quality of life.",

      "title": "Gastrointestinal motility and perception disorders re-visited",
      "abstract": "The importance of gastrointestinal motility and gut perception in medicine has been long recognized. Physiologically, these key functions ensure normal unperceived feeding and digestion, crucial aspects of health and wellbeing. Conversely, pathophysiological disturbances may produce digestive symptoms, which are common in the general population and may range from the simply annoying to the incapacitating. In fact, major disturbances may lead to malnourishment, metabolic imbalance and general deterioration of the body. Altered normal gut motility may also disrupt gut homeostasis, induce changes in the gut flora and facilitate bacterial translocation from the intestine to other viscera (Fig. 1). Clinical recognition of gastrointestinal motility and perception disorders is largely based on the anatomic localization of their symptomatic expression (1-4). Thus, dysphagia, reflux symptoms and chest pain are normally associated with esophageal or gastroesophageal disturbances. Upper abdominal pain or discomfort, early satiety, nausea and vomiting, and other dyspeptic-like symptoms are usually ascribed to dysfunction of the stomach and/or upper small bowel. Bloating is a somewhat mysterious symptom that may be generated by motor/sensorial disturbances throughout the gastrointestinal tract. Diarrhea and/or constipation usually result from small bowel and/or colonic disorders. Ano-rectal symptoms usually derive from dysfunction of the pelvic floor, distal colon or sphincteric structures. Traditionally, clinical conditions were divided into somatic gastrointestinal motility disorders: achalasia, gastroparesis, chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction and so on, and functional disorders: dyspepsia, irritable bowel syndrome and a myriad of clinical syndromes and descriptions. The distinction between both groups was largely based on whether a propulsive failure was or not demonstrated by conventional imaging tests. Thus, a patient with recurrent abdominal pain and distension could be categorized either as a chronic intestinal pseudoobstruction (if dilated loops of bowel were visualized on Xrays) or irritable bowel syndrome (if nothing obviously abnormal was found). Application of more sophisticated and discriminating diagnostic tests (intestinal manometry, barostat, etc.) and histology increasingly showed that Gastrointestinal motility and perception disorders re-visited",

      "title": "Night Eating Syndrome Presenting as Anorexia in an Athlete",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Night eating syndrome (NES) was first described by Stunkard in 1955 as \"morning anorexia, evening or nocturnal hyperphagia in a fully conscious state, and insomnia\" (21). Over time, the syndrome has been further characterized to distinguish it from other forms of nighttime eating. Although some debate still exists, NES encompasses a few key behaviors, including evening hyperphagia (or late night eating before initiating sleep) and eating after awakening from sleep (night eating) either in a fully or semi-conscious state (11). This is in contrast to binge eating disorder (BED), which describes episodes of consuming large quantities of food in discrete time periods without control (23), or sleep related eating disorder (SRED), which refers to involuntary nocturnal eating, often of bizarre foods or inedible items, that occurs after awakening (25). Late-night eating also can be found in other diagnoses, such as bulimia nervosa or dissociative disorders, but in these cases it is usually a part of a group of symptoms rather than the central problem. The hallmark of NES is a delay of caloric intake until the evening and night hours. Birketvedt revealed that night eaters consume 56% of their daily caloric intake between the hours of 8 p.m. and 6 a.m., compared with 15% by control subjects (5). The foods consumed during episodes of evening hyperphagia and night eating tend to be carbohydrate-rich (7), with a high carbohydrate to protein ratio of 7:1. Nighttime awakenings are common among night eaters, and >50% of these episodes were associated with food intake, compared with 0% in control subjects (5). CASE PRESENTATION A 19-yr-old college softball player was referred to a sports medicine clinic by her team's strength staff and teammates for not eating during the daytime and a concern for possible anorexia nervosa. For most of the day, she reported a lack of appetite until approximately 3 p.m., when she ate her first meal. A teammate reported her to be seen pushing her food around the plate and not eating. She attempted to restrict calories during meals because of a bloated feeling in the morning. She denied binging or purging activities. She was seen 3 months earlier by another physician for a complaint of insomnia. She denied difficulty with initiating sleep, but experienced frequent nighttime awakenings, on average three to four times in one night. She had one roommate, and she denied excessive noise, poorly regulated temperature, or light disturbances. She did not discuss her nighttime eating with that physician. She also denied nightmares or night terrors. She had attempted over-the-counter sleep aids without improvement in her symptoms. She was started on zolpidem tartrate, which did not diminish the number of awakenings. Upon each awakening she would consume a snack, consisting of carbohydrate-rich foods, such as cookies or crackers, frequently more than 1000 calories over the night. Although she tried to refrain from eating, she felt unsatisfied and unable to reinitiate sleep until consuming food. Generally, she reported being conscious while eating. However, at times she only would become aware of the episodes by the food wrappers surrounding her bed the next morning. After eating she easily returned to sleep, but reawakened 1-2 h later. Her roommate reported having her personal food confiscated by the patient at night and engaging in conversations that the patient could not recall the following day. The following morning after an episode, she experienced a moderate amount of guilt related to her eating and modest weight gain of approximately 7 lb. She admitted to a mildly depressed mood and intermittent anhedonia. She reported anxiety related to increased life stressors over the past few months associated with softball, classes, and a new relationship. She denied having difficulty concentrating or a decline in academic work. However, she noticed decreased endurance and performance during softball practice and competitions, especially with morning activities during which she felt tired, bloated, and groggy. By not eating for most of the day, she often lacked enough energy to complete an entire afternoon practice. She denied suicidal or homicidal ideation. At the time of the visit about eating disorder concern, she was no longer taking any medication or supplements. She denied a personal or family history of eating disorders. A complete review of systems was otherwise negative. Upon examination, vital signs were normal; height was 5'6,\" and weight was 160 lb. The physical and psychiatric exams were unremarkable. Her Zung depression scale score was 24, and her night eating questionnaire score was 49. EPIDEMIOLOGY Although NES was described initially in the obesity literature, it is not limited to this demographic. The syndrome's prevalence among the general population is estimated at 1.5% (19). Up to 8.9% of obesity clinic patients meet the criteria for NES (16). However, the diagnostic patterns do not appear to be different for obese and non-obese individuals with NES (7). A recent study investigating familial aggregation showed that individuals with NES were more likely to have an affected first-degree relative than control subjects (OR = 4.9) (13). Recently, the link between psychiatric illness and NES has become of interest because of its association with stress and depression. Lundgren et al. found that 12.3% of patients in an outpatient psychiatric clinic met the diagnostic criteria for NES and that these patients had a higher rate of substance abuse and atypical antipsychotic use than patients without NES (12). DIAGNOSIS As NES is not included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorder (DSM-IV), variance in diagnostic criteria is widely seen in both past and present studies. In a recent evaluation of diagnostic criteria, Allison et al. report that the definition of night eating has ranged from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m. to the more general \"after the evening meal,\" while the proportion of total calories consumed has varied from 25% to 50% (2). These inconsistencies create some difficulty in generalizing investigational results to the general population, as well as clearly identifying whether a patient meets criteria for the actual syndrome or is a variant of normal. In reality, many people have episodes of late-night eating, and in households that often spend evenings watching television, after-dinner snacking may be the norm. In addition, there is variation in the average dinnertime among cultures, with the average person in the United States eating between 5 p.m. and 7 p.m., while the average person in Europe has dinner between 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. The question of whether to include NES in the DSM-V has prompted further investigation into the diagnostic tools and criteria currently used. In an attempt to assess two screening instruments, Vander Wal et al. found that use of a single simple screening question had adequate sensitivity but poor specificity to identify patients correctly with NES (24). Additionally, while the NEQ was correlated positively with increasing diagnostic detail, there was an inability to achieve both high sensitivity and specificity with varying cut points. Vander Wal concluded that the difference between eating late at night versus waking from sleep to eat might be the key to distinguishing NES as a true pathologic state. By evaluating several items from the Night Eating Questionnaire (NEQ), Allison et al. found that three items appear to be core aspects of the disorder: 1) evening hyperphagia and/or nocturnal eating, 2) initial insomnia, and 3) awakenings from sleep (4). Their analysis suggests that the presence of morning anorexia and a delayed morning meal added little additional information. The NEQ has evolved alongside research to characterize NES. Developed as a standardized screening tool for diagnosing NES, the current version is a 14-item questionnaire that addresses both behavioral and psychological aspects of the syndrome. The questions investigate the following aspects of NES: morning hunger and timing of first food consumption, cravings, control over eating before bedtime and during nighttime awakenings, percentage of post-dinner food consumption, initial insomnia, frequency of awakenings, associated food consumption during awakenings and awareness during these episodes, and mood disturbance (4). By varying the cut score, Allison et al. calculated that a positive predictive value of up to 77% can be attained (2). While the NEQ has been shown to be an efficient and valid measure of the severity of NES, its primary use is as a screening tool and it should not replace clinical interview for diagnosis. PATHOPHYSIOLOGY In general, it has been recognized that the pattern of intake rather than the total calories ingested is different in NES subjects compared with controls (17). NES has been linked to changes in the circadian rhythm and disturbances in the hypothalamic-pituitary axis (HPA). Therefore, NES has been described as delayed circadian eating patterns superimposed upon normal sleep-wake cycles (17). An inpatient study by Allison et al. showed a decrease in overnight ghrelin levels, a stomach-derived appetite stimulant, compared with control subjects, whereas insulin and glucose increased at night (1). No difference was found in secretion of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), melatonin, leptin, cortisol, or prolactin. In comparison, Birketvedt et al. found attenuated secretions of nocturnal leptin (an adipocyte-derived appetite suppressant) and melatonin, whereas cortisol was increased (5). In a small study comparing the response to corticotropin-releasing hormone among people with NES and control subjects, an attenuated response of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol release was observed, suggesting an overexpressed HPA (10). The authors interpret this finding to be a result of the constant stressful stimuli to which people with NES are exposed, but they note that, alternately, it may be a direct result of a fasting state. They hypothesize that the behaviors of disordered sleep and increased nighttime appetite may be related directly to the neurotransmitter alterations that are caused by an increase in corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) stimulation. Based upon the observed caloric intake and neuroendocrine assays in a study of 15 women with NES and 14 control subjects, Goel et al. theorized that NES might represent dissociation between a central timing mechanism in the suprachiasmatic nucleus and other presumed regulator systems in the central nervous system, stomach, or liver (9). Again, the question of causality arises in interpreting whether the observed differences in ghrelin, leptin, melatonin, insulin, and glucose amplitudes and timing are altered independently compared with control subjects or are results of the abnormal behaviors of nocturnal waking and eating. TREATMENT Researchers have explored several pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic therapeutic options for NES, including serotonin reuptake inhibitors, topiramate, cognitive behavioral therapy, relaxation training, and light therapy. Lundgren et al. demonstrated elevated binding of midbrain serotonin transporters, which may amplify the reuptake of serotonin and impair postsynaptic serotonin transmission (14). This theory can explain why selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) are useful in treating individuals with NES. Early studies and case reports related reduction in night eating episodes and decrease in overall caloric intake to both short-term (2 wk) (15) and long-term (6-15 months) (20) SSRI use. In an 8-wk randomized, placebo-controlled study of sertraline for NES, 12/17 in the sertraline group responded to therapy compared with 3/17 in the control group (16). Seven of the 12 responders in the sertraline group had a remission or complete resolution of symptoms, compared with one of the three responders in the control group. This study was different than previous SSRI trials because it included a small number of normal weight subjects. Of these, two of the three in the sertraline group responded, compared with zero of three in the control group. Participants in the study group had a 30% chance of responding at 2 wk and a 50% chance of responding between weeks 4 and 8. Overall, the sertraline group had a significant reduction in the symptoms of NES, including a reduction in nocturnal ingestions (80%), lower caloric intake after the evening meal (32.5%), and weight loss (approximately 1 lb·wk−1). The changes in night eating did not correlate with changes in depressive symptoms, which were modest at baseline. Because individuals with NES report greater levels of depression and anxiety in addition to displaying evidence of elevated stress (increased cortisol and CRH), Pawlow et al. designed a study to evaluate effects of relaxation training (18). The study focused upon the short-term effects on a group (N = 10) randomized to abbreviated progressive muscle relaxation technique (APRT) compared with control subjects (N = 10). Participants in the APRT group reported lower levels of anxiety and stress and higher levels of relaxation immediately after a session, which correlated to lower levels of salivary cortisol. After 7 d of home practice, the significant decrease in levels of anxiety and stress persisted in the APRT group compared with control subjects. The relaxation group also had a significant increase in morning appetite and decrease in evening appetite rating, but had a nonsignificant decrease in days with post-bedtime eating. Bright-light therapy has been suggested as a therapy for weight loss in obese subjects (6). A case report of an obese woman with NES demonstrated resolution of night eating symptoms when exposed to light therapy, in addition to decreased depression scores (8). NES symptoms recurred when light therapy was discontinued. Light therapy's ability to alter the circadian pattern changes seen in NES may explain this therapeutic observation. DISCUSSION We used the following provisional criteria outlined by Birketvedt (1999) (5) to diagnose our athlete with NES: 1) morning anorexia, even if breakfast is eaten; 2) evening hyperphagia, in which >50% of daily energy intake is consumed after the evening meal; 3) awakenings at least once per night; 4) consumption of snacks during awakenings; 5) repetition of provisional criteria longer than 3 months; and 6) does not meet the criteria for bulimia nervosa or binge eating disorder. To our knowledge, there have been no studies or case reports focusing upon NES in the athletic population. However, there is a well-accepted association between sports participation and eating disorders. While determining the true prevalence in athletes has been difficult, one Norwegian study estimated that 13.5% of elite athletes have eating disorders, defined as anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and eating disorder not otherwise specified, compared with 4.6% in the control population (22). Our patient was diagnosed before the Allison et al. (2009) proposed diagnostic criteria for night eating syndrome (3). Our patient fulfilled these criteria as well as the older Birketvedt criteria. With regard to NES, there are specific issues to consider in the athletic population. First, although morning anorexia may exist, athletes may force themselves to eat breakfast to meet the energy demands of early morning practice or competition. Similarly, athletes may appear to have a normal percentage of preevening meal calories, but their calorie requirements may far exceed their intake. As in our athlete, symptoms of underperformance as a result of a negative energy balance and inadequate sleep may be the driving factor to seek medical attention. Finally, although some athletes may notice weight gain, overall they are less likely to be clinically overweight or obese given the intense training required to perform at a high level. Our athlete's initial complaint was of insomnia, and she was instructed initially in basic sleep-hygiene practices. Her nighttime eating was not mentioned on the first visit, and the prescription of a sleep aid may have exacerbated her problem. Once NES was diagnosed, she was started on sertraline (50 mg daily). She was titrated gradually up to a dose of 200 mg daily over the next 6 wk. She was simultaneously sent to the college mental health center for cognitive-behavioral therapy. She went for four visits and reported a significant reduction in symptoms with the treatments. Although she awoke on average once per night, down from the previous three to four times each night, she was usually able to return to sleep almost immediately without eating. She developed regular eating patterns, consuming three regular meals per day with one to two snacks. Her mood improved and anhedonia also resolved. She continued softball participation throughout her treatment, with noticeable improvements and increased consistency in performance once her night eating resolved.",

      "title": "Assessment and Management of Insomnia",
      "abstract": "INSOMNIA IS A COMMON TREATABLE disorder of insufficient or poorquality sleep, with adverse daytime consequences. Insomnia presents as trouble falling asleep (long-sleep latency), trouble staying asleep (excessive or prolonged awakenings), or feeling nonrestored from sleep. Insomnia can be a primary disorder emerging in childhood or later, a conditioned (psychophysiological) disorder, or comorbid with a psychiatric, medical, or other sleep disorder. Insomnia can be transient (related to stress, illness, travel) or chronic (occurring nightly for 6 months). Persistent untreated insomnia is a strong risk factor for major depression. Insomnia must be distinguished from sleep-state misperception and short sleep states without symptoms. More than 50 epidemiological studies have shown that one third of various general populations have insomnia symptoms and that 9% to 21% have insomnia with serious daytime consequences, such as bodily fatigue, diminished energy, difficulty concentrating, memory impairment, low motivation, loss of productivity, irritability, interpersonal difficulties (with family, friends, coworkers), increased worrying, anxiety, and depression. Chronic sleep loss, which occurs in untreated insomnia, is a major risk factor for fatigue-related automobile crashes and industrial accidents, loss of jobs, marital and social problems, poor health, metabolic and endocrine dysregulation with impaired ability to maintain weight control, coronary heart disease, major depression, and suicidality. Insomnia is associated with enormous direct and indirect costs, as much as $14 billion in the United States in 1995. Physicians should therefore establish an effective clinical strategy for eliciting and managing insomnia complaints. Use of a sleep-trained nurse, psychologist, or both on a consultation basis or as a member of the physician’s medical practice should be considered. One study has reported on the benefit of behavioral treatment of insomnia provided by a trained clinic nurse in a general medical practice. However, the cost-effectiveness of incorporating a sleep-trained nurse or psychologist into a medical practice has yet to be reported.",

      "abstract": "Es wird über eine 37-jährige Patientin mit Anorexia nervosa berichtet, die seit vielen Jahren für mehrere Tage bis Wochen hungerte, um ihr Körpergewicht zu senken und eine euphorisierende Wirkung zu erzielen. Im Verlauf der letzten vier Jahre entwickelte sich bei der Patientin jeweils unmittelbar nach einer einwöchigen Hungerperiode eine akute paranoid-halluzinatorische Psychose, die 3-mal stationär behandelt werden musste. Psychotische Prodromalsymptome waren vor und zu Beginn der Hungerzeit nicht eruierbar, so dass ein kausaler Zusammenhang zwischen dem Hungern und der psychotischen Dekompensation gesehen werden kann. Anhand dieser Kasuistik wird die Hypothese diskutiert, dass während des Hungerns im Rahmen der Anorexia nervosa temporär eine Hyperaktivität des dopaminergen Systems entstehen könnte und dadurch der Übergang in eine paranoid-halluzinatorische Psychose erklärbar wäre. Der Fall zeigt, dass bei vulnerablen Patienten mit einer ähnlichen Anamnese von einer Hungerkur oder anderen eingreifenden Diätmaßnahmen dringend abgeraten werden muss. Der Hinweis auf das erhöhte Psychoserisiko könnte so einen therapeutischen Nutzen für die Behandlung der Anorexia nervosa bei solchen Patienten haben.",

Characteristic symptoms, in addition to upper abdominal pain or discomfort, are nausea, vomiting, early satiety, anorexia, postprandial abdominal bloating and excessive repetitive postprandial belching. Patients with concomitant symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome are currently excluded from this clinical entity. Delayed gastric emptying of solids and/or liquids, postprandial antral hypomotility and antroduodenal incoordination, gastric myoelectrical arrhythmias and dysfunction of visceral afferents are the major alterations in upper gut sensorimotor activity which have been described. An empirical trial of medical therapy is warranted if there are no “alarm” symptoms at presentation. If symptoms are not relieved after 2-4 weeks, then investigations of the upper gastrointestinal tract, preferably by endoscopy, to exclude the presence of organic disease, is advisable. Management approaches are then reassurance, dietary manipulations and attention to psychosocial aspects. Prokinetic agents appear to be useful as short-term medical therapy in some patients, but optimum long-term treatment strategies, including the use of medications which may improve a diminished tolerance to gut distension, are not established.",

      "abstract": "El denominado Trastorno de la ingestion alimentaria de la infancia o ninez recogido en el DSM-IV-TR (1), se define como “Una alteracion de la alimentacion mani-festada por una dificultad persistente para comer adecua-damente, con incapacidad para aumentar de peso o con perdidas significativas de peso durante por lo menos un mes” ademas su inicio debe ser anterior a los seis anos de edad. Abarca una serie de conductas disfuncionales relacionadas con la ingestion alimentaria como pueden ser: tragar sin masticar la comida, negarse a comer, vomitar la comida o masticar con excesiva lentitud. Es-tos tipos de problemas angustian a los padres de manera desmesurada en muchas ocasiones. Con cierta frecuencia no saben como abordarlo, con lo que intentan multiples maneras de solucionarlo, entre las que se encuentran un peregrinaje por distintos especialistas y la consecuente realizacion de multiples pruebas medicas asi como una medicalizacion innecesaria, que en la mayoria de las oca-siones resultan infructuosas.Esta problematica es bastante frecuente en la infancia. Manikam y Perman (2) afirman que mas del 25 por ciento de los ninos presentan conductas dificiles relacionadas con la alimentacion, llegando hasta el 80 por ciento en ninos con dificultades ambientales. En un estudio llevado a cabo en Londres (3) con ninos de tres anos de edad, se encontro que el 16 por ciento mostraba, poco apetito y el 12 por ciento eran caprichosos con los alimentos. No se encontraron diferencias entre sexos. Los problemas se mantuvieron en dos tercios de los ninos al ano siguiente y en un tercio tres anos despues.Normalmente este tipo de trastornos de la conducta alimentaria requiere de dos tipos de intervenciones es-pecificas: 1. La instauracion de habitos alimentarios “adecua-dos” y su mantenimiento. Cambiando el patron relacional que se establece entre el nino y el cui-dador principal durante el acto de la alimentacion.2. Modificacion de las creencias de los padres acerca de la alimentacion del nino (4). En muchas ocasio-nes el problema se situa en creencias erroneas por parte de los padres acerca de lo que es adecuado o no comer o sobre la idea de delgadez.Este tipo de patologias alimentarias normalmente no suponen un riesgo vital para el menor, pero si pueden ocasionar diferentes desajustes en el desarrollo person-al y en la propia configuracion de la dinamica familiar. Asi en muchos hogares son motivo de discusion entre los progenitores, de disputas entre padres e hijos y de desacuerdo entre distintos miembros del clan familiar configurando un ambiente propicio para la aparicion de nuevos problemas de indole conductual, fisiologica o emocional.Chambless y Ollendick (5) recogen los tratamientos psicologicos empiricamente validados establecidos por los grupos de trabajo de la Task Force de la APA. Den-tro de los problemas pediatricos, y mas concretamente de los alimentarios, Kerwin (6) establece que el unico tratamiento empiricamente validado para los trastornos severos de alimentacion es la terapia de conducta.",

      "title": "Clinical Management of Constipation",
      "abstract": "First, it is important to find out whether the patient is complaining of infrequent defaecation, excessive straining at defaecation, abdominal pain or bloating, a general sense of malaise attributed to constipation, soiling, or a combination of more than one symptom. Second, one must decide if there is a definable abnormality as a cause of the symptom(s). Is the colon apparently normal or is its lumen widened (megacolon)? Is the upper gut normal or is there evidence of neuropathy or myopathy? Is the anorectum normal or is there evidence of a weak pelvic floor, mucosal prolapse, major rectocele, an internal intussusception or solitary rectal ulcer? Is there any systemic component such as hypothyroidism, hypercalcaemia, neurological or psychiatric disorder or relevant drug therapy? Choice of treatment will depend on this clinical evaluation. The range of treatments available is: Reassurance and stop current treatment: Patients with a bowel obsession may take laxatives or rectal preparations regularly without need. Increase dietary fibre: Most cases of 'simple' constipation respond to increased dietary fibre, possibly with an added supplement of natural bran. Toilet training and altered routine of life: Young people particularly may need to recognise the call to stool and alter their daily routine to permit and encourage regular defaecation. Medicinal bulking agent: Ispaghula, methyl cellulose, concentrated wheat germ or bran, and similar preparations are useful when patients with a normal colon find it difficult to take adequate dietary fibre. These preparations increase the bulk of stool and soften its consistency. They may be useful for those patients with the constipated form of irritable bowel syndrome. Additional bulk does not help patients with megacolon or severe idiopathic slow transit constipation. Osmotic laxatives or saline perfusion: Preparations of magnesium hydroxide or sulphate, sodium sulphate, or mannitol soften the stool and if taken in sufficient quantity produce a liquid stool. Magnesium hydroxide is a useful mild laxative for use in childhood. Patients with idiopathic megacolon need to keep the stools liquid with an osmotic laxative. Stimulant laxatives: Anthranoid preparations, bisacodyl and its derivatives are used occasionally by many patients and regularly by some patients with severe idiopathic slow transit constipation. Prokinetic drugs: Can be helpful as a supplement to laxatives. Rectal preparations: Useful particularly for emptying the rectum in childhood and elderly patients with rectal impaction and soiling. Biofeedback: Biofeedback training to increase rectal sensitivity to distension, relax the pelvic floor and increase the effectiveness of straining is proving beneficial for some patients with slow transit constipation and many of those with marked paradoxical contraction of the pelvic floor including children with soiling. Psychological: Certain patients, for example those with 'denied bowel actions' or eating disorders need primary psychiatric treatment. Other patients, for example those with a history of sexual abuse, may need it as a supportive measure. Surgery: Surgery is needed for aganglionosis, a few patients with idiopathic megacolon or idiopathic slow transit constipation or pseudoobstruction, and for those with severe rectal mucosal prolapse.",

Common FGID include gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), functional dysphagia, functional dyspepsia, gastroparesis, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), functional constipation, diarrhea, and fecal incontinence. While pathogeneses of FGID are not completely understood, major pathophysiological factors include impaired gastrointestinal motility, visceral hypersensitivity, and psychological issues as well as disruption of the gut microbiota [1]. Gastrointestinal dysmotility is most common in FGID. For example, impaired lower esophageal sphincter function may lead to dysphagia in case of impaired relaxation during swallowing or GERD in case of reduced pressure or increased transient relaxation. In the stomach, reduced gastric relaxation during food intake may lead to impaired gastric accommodation, causing symptoms of early satiety and bloating; impaired antral peristalsis may lead to delayed gastric emptying, causing symptoms of nausea and vomiting. In the lower gut, impaired colon motility slows down transit, resulting in constipation, whereas a weak anal sphincter may lead to fecal incontinence. Visceral hypersensitivity is one of the major causes of pain and discomfort. It is commonly reported in patients with noncardiac chest pain, functional dyspepsia, and IBS. Depression and anxiety are commonly present in patients with FGID. Recently disruption of the gut microbiota has also been reported in patients with FGID.",

The medical community has failed to focus enough attention on this condition, which remains a sort of psychosocial taboo, enhancing patient anxiety. Defecatory distur- bance classified according to cause and location can fall into one of four groups: 1) Endocrine abnormalities; 2) Disturbances of colonic origin that result from the long-term use of antihypertensive drugs or antidepressants or from circadian rhythm disturbances that occur with skipping breakfast or lower dietary fiber. Irri- table bowel syndrome (IBS) and melanosis coli cases fall under this category; 3) Defecatory disturbance originating in the rectum (outlet obstruction syndrome). Rectocele, rectal prolapse, concealed prolapse, mucosal prolapse syndrome, and irritable rectal syndrome fall into this category. Pelvic descent and perineal descent are often caused by a dysfunction of the pudendal nerves that innervate the atonic levator ani muscle that forms the basis of the pelvis; and 4) Defecatory disturbance caused by anal diseases such as hemorrhoids, anal fistulas, fissure, postoperative complications, as well as other factors. The same individual may have more than one of the complications listed above. Therefore, diagnosis by thorough examina- tion is essential.",

      "abstract": "Chronic constipation is one of the most frequent symptoms encountered by physicians in their daily clinical practice. This symptom may be broadly subdivided into primary (so-called 'idiopathic' or 'functional') constipation and secondary constipation; the latter is associated with endocrine, metabolic and neurological disorders (e.g., hyperparathyroidism, diabetes mellitus, Parkinson's disease), luminal obstruction (e.g., colon neoplasms) and use of drugs (e.g., anticholinergics and opioids) [1]. Here, we will focus on some known etiologic factors underlying primary constipation. The definition of constipation varies greatly according to the descriptor (layman, patient, physician, researcher), and several definitions are available in the literature; definitions not always overlapping. However, the two main aspects on which there is ample agreement is that constipation is characterized by a reduction (up to absence) of bowel movements and/or frequent (conventionally defined as at least a quarter of the occasions) difficult expulsion of stools (straining at stools) [1]. It is worth noting that these two aspects also broadly define the two main subtypes of chronic constipation, represented by slow-transit constipation (STC) and obstructed defecation (OD) [1].",

      "abstract": "Neurogenic bowel dysfunction remains a major life-limiting problem and has also long been known as an area of poor self-care after spinal cord injury. Impairments in sensation of need for defecation, of volitional control, and the potential for constipation and fecal incontinence cause distress, impact social function, and present management challenges. Management goals include optimal social function, especially minimizing incontinence and interference with living activities, and prevention of complications such as abdominal pain, impaction, bowel obstruction, and hemorrhoids. Gastrointestinal problems in both the acute and the chronic phases of spinal cord injury are a major cause of gastrointestinal morbidity. The control of the gastrointestinal system involves complex interactions between autonomic and somatic innervation that ultimately act at the level of the intrinsic enteric nervous system. Patients with spinal cord injuries need a bowel program that allows socially acceptable continence and prevents fecal impaction. Neurogenic bowel dysfunction in spinal cord injuries refers to the colonic dysfunction that occurs as reduced colonic transit, constipation, disordered evacuation reflexes, and potential incontinence following disruption of normal control. In addition to defecation problems due to neurogenic bowel dysfunction, gastrointestinal problems associated with the upper gastrointestinal tract include dysphagia, gastroesophageal reflux, gastric ulcer and gastritis, superior mesenteric artery syndrome, gallbladder disease, and pancreatitis. Nutritional homeostasis after major injuries is often associated with more favorable results by the timing and route of nutritional supplementation.",

      "abstract": "Although the majority of patients with anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa develop these disorders in their teens and 20s, some patients develop an eating disorder in their 30s, 40s, or 50s. We present a subgroup of patients with the following pattern of symptoms and historical detail: (1) severe sexual and physical abuse by family members; (2) relatively good premorbid professional and marital adjustment (considering later difficulties) though characterized by (3) hypomania, binge eating, and morbid obesity. A pronounced shift in eating behaviors follows (4) medical trauma (e.g., injury, cancer, surgery) that occurs after age 30, interrupts previous hypomanic adaptation, and leads to severe restriction, purging, and dramatic weight loss (e.g., 100 lb). Although only one patient met full criteria for anorexia nervosa, weight loss and starvation were serious enough to provoke further medical crises in all patients. Finally, (5) during both weight loss and weight restoration patients demonstrated significant dissociative disturbance, including dissociated mood and personality states (i.e., multiple personality disorder), self-destructive behavioral episodes repeating early trauma, and avoidance of food as a way to manage PTSD symptoms. © 1995 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

      "title": "The psychological basis of hunger and its dysfunctions",
      "abstract": "This article describes a new and emerging psychological perspective on hunger, together with the implications of that perspective, which is based upon learning and memory. Hunger is a psychological state characterized by a desire to eat. Historically, conceptions of hunger have largely been expressed in terms of physiology (eg, biological process X causes hunger). However, physiology neither offers a psychological account of hunger nor explains why memory impairment can eliminate hunger. Two forms of hunger are identified - specific and general. Specific hunger is for particular palatable foods. It involves recollecting episodic memories of eating that food, when an associated cue is encountered (eg, an advert). General hunger is a desire to eat triggered by temporal (eg, it is lunchtime) or interoceptive (eg, tummy rumble) cues. It involves semantic memory retrieval, which then augments the expected - remembered - pleasure for any food. Both hungers are supported by the medial temporal lobe memory system. Damage to this system can occur from eating a Western-style diet and, longer-term, from obesity and its consequences. Medial temporal lobe memory damage may cause deficits in specific hunger, but most especially in general hunger, resulting in little motivation to eat foods that the individual considers to be of low-to-moderate palatability, such as fruit and vegetables. The implications of this account for teaching people hunger, for how hunger is affected by diet, for public education, and pharmaceutical intervention, are discussed. Psychological concepts of hunger are widely used in nutritional practice. This article provides a new and emerging perspective on the psychological basis of hunger and its implications.",

The pains are assumed to be due to locally limited epileptic discharges in areas of the cortex where the digestive tract is represented. When the neuronal discharges reach other brain formations, multisymptomatic, partial or generalized epileptic seizures occur. In such cases, therefore, the abdominal symptomatology is either a first stage or a rudiment of a more complex course of attack, and should not be considered as the expression of a particular form of epilepsy that might be termed abdominal epilepsy. Difficulties regarding differential diagnosis ensue in the case of migraine with abdominal symptomatology. The latter should be taken into account when relapsing attacks of abdominal pain, which cannot be explained gastroenterologically, persist for hours and alternate with headache. In case of doubt, a family history of migraine confirms the diagnosis.",

      "title": "Non‐ulcer dyspepsia: myths and realities",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY Dyspepsia can be defined as the presence of upper abdominal pain or discomfort; other symptoms referable to the proximal gastrointestinal tract, such as nausea, early satiety, and bloating, may also be present. Symptoms may or may not be meal related. To be termed chronic, dyspepsia should have been present for three months or longer. Over half the patients who present with chronic dyspepsia have no evidence of peptic ulceration, other focal lesions, or systemic disease and are diagnosed as having non‐ulcer (or functional) dyspepsia. Non‐ulcer dyspepsia is a heterogeneous syndrome. It has been proposed that this entity can be subdivided into a number of symptomatic clusters or groupings that suggest possible underlying pathogenetic mechanisms. These groupings include ulcer‐like dyspepsia (typical symptoms of peptic ulcer are present), dysmotility (stasis)‐like dyspepsia (symptoms include nausea, early satiety, bloating, and belching that suggest gastric stasis or small intestinal dysmotility), and reflux‐like dyspepsia (heartburn or acid regurgitation accompanies upper abdominal pain or discomfort). The aetiology of non‐ulcer dyspepsia is not established, although it is likely a multifactorial disorder. Motility abnormalities may be important in a subset of dyspepsia patients but probably do not explain the symptoms in the majority. Epidemiological studies have not convincingly demonstrated an association between Helicobacter pylori and non‐ulcer dyspepsia. Other potential aetiological mechanisms, such as increased gastric acid secretion, psychological factors, life‐event stress, and dietary factors, have not been established as causes of non‐ulcer dyspepsia. Management of non‐ulcer dyspepsia is difficult because its pathogenesis is poorly understood and is confounded because of a high placebo response rate. Until more data are available, it seems reasonable that treatment regimens target the clinical groupings described above. Antacids are no more effective than placebo in non‐ulcer dyspepsia, although a subgroup of non‐ulcer dyspepsia patients with reflux‐like or ulcer‐like symptoms may respond to H 2 ‐receptor antagonists. However, there is no significant benefit of these agents over placebo in many cases. Bismuth has been shown to be superior to placebo in patients with H. pylori in a number of studies, but these trials had several shortcomings and others have reported conflicting findings. Sucralfate was demonstrated in one study to be superior to placebo, but this finding was not confirmed by another group of investigators. Prokinetic drugs appear to be efficacious, and may be most useful in patients with dysmotility‐like and reflux‐like dyspepsia.",

In many instances it may reasonably be supposed that subjective feelings of pain or discomfort in the stomach, leading to the refusal of food, arise from organic disease or functional disorder of that organ. That there is a centre in the brain, disorder of which causes a distaste for food, has been suggested, but is scarcely worthy of serious consideration. The cause is more likely to be some local affection, such as malignant disease, gastric ulcer, or simple gastritis, giving rise to pain on the ingestion of food; the refusal of food is then the translation of a protest from a stomach in an unfit state to receive any but the lightest food.",

When conventional diagnostic means do not readily identify an underlying cause, abnormal gastric sensorimotor function is thought to be the pathophysiological mechanism. Disordered gastric motility occurs when the processes of interdigestive motility, gastric reservoir function or gastric emptying are not properly controlled. Conditions associated with disordered gastric motility include functional dyspepsia, gastroparesis, dumping syndrome, and (other) postoperative states. Symptoms in these patients include postprandial fullness and bloating, early satiation, nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain and burning, loss of appetite, and, in more severe cases, weight loss. After exclusion of organic disease, gastric emptying testing is the most frequently used diagnostic procedure, but its role in explaining symptoms and guiding therapy is limited. Besides small dietary adjustments, gastroprokinetic drugs are the treatment of choice for gastroparesis and also functional dyspepsia. In refractory cases, centrally acting agents, such as antidepressants, or hypnotherapy have been advocated, and nutritional support may be required in patients with severe weight loss. The diagnosis of dumping syndrome is based on clinical suspicion and can be aided by a glucose challenge test. Treatment consists of dietary measures, acarbose, and somatostatin analogs in refractory cases.",

      "abstract": "Motor neurone disease is a rapidly progressive and fatal neurodegenerative condition which causes progressive weakness, with normal sensation. It can occur at any age but is more frequent with increasing age. Key clinical presentations include bulbar (slurred or difficult speech, problems swallowing, tongue fasciculation), limb (typically in one limb with weakness and muscle wasting), respiratory (breathlessness, chest muscle fasciculation) and cognitive features (behavioural change, emotional lability, features of frontotemporal dementia). Although survival is typically three to five years from symptom onset, there is significant individual variation. Rarely, survival may be 20 years or longer. Favourable features include a limb rather than a bulbar presentation, preserved weight and respiratory function, younger age of onset and longer time from fist symptom to diagnosis. The patient should be linked to a multidisciplinary team able to provide support from the start with a designated individual as the point of contact, with regular, coordinated assessments, as the patient's needs change and their condition progresses. Gastrostomy is an important supportive intervention which maximizes nutrition, and minimizes aspiration and chest infection. Adequate nutrition and hydration is key to maximizing health and survival. It is possible for a patient to control a computer and speech by eye. movement alone. An important consideration is voice banking where the patient may store their voice before there is difficulty with speech so that it can be used at a later stage if they need a communication aid. Impaired cough and retention of respiratory secretions is frequent in the later stages, and may be managed with physiotherapy. The patient should be referred for expert respiratory assessment if needed.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Neurogenic bowel dysfunction ranks as one of the most frequent problems experienced by people with multiple sclerosis (MS); it is one of the first symptoms to appear at disease onset and continues throughout the course of the disease. This review, based on literature searches of Medline and PubMed, examines bowel dysfunction causes and cofactors (ie, impaired mobility, fatigue, depression and anxiety, childbirth) that occur over the course of the disease. Coverage includes management of bowel dysfunction with noninvasive methods, including diet and fluid intake, together with pharmacologic treatments for constipation and fecal incontinence as well as more advanced treatments (ie, biofeedback, abdominal massage, transanal irrigation, posterior tibial nerve stimulation), caregiver-provided treatments and extended care facilities. Bowel dysfunction problems and related cofactors impact quality of life throughout the MS disease course, requiring appropriate interventions to improve and/or maintain the quality of life of the individual with MS.",

There are many causes, some of which are unknown, but the common ones can be divided into three groups. Congenital developmental failure may be total and incompatible with life, or less severe, in which case resection may be possible. Acquired inflammatory damage, other than Chagas' disease, can occur anywhere in the gut. Autonomic neuropathy may involve either the neurons or the Schwann cells.

      "abstract": "Abstract Food addiction is a topic that has received attention in the psychological literature in part because of the role that it potentially plays in binge eating, obesity, and eating disorders. Food addiction has also received attention as an addiction in its own right, akin to widely known addictive substances and behaviors such as drugs, gambling, and sex. An addiction is defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM‐IV‐TR) as (1) the use of a substance that has mood altering or psychoactive effects, (2) highly controlled or compulsive use of a substance, and (3) the used substance reinforces behavior (American Psychiatric Association, 2000). Other criteria include tolerance and physical dependence. Food addiction specifically is typically characterized by a loss of control over eating certain foods, preoccupation with or craving of certain food or foods, failed attempts to overcome the eating problem despite negative consequences, and use of the food or foods to cope with negative emotions. Food addiction has been tied most often to highly palatable foods such as chocolate, confectionary foods, carbohydrate‐rich foods, and foods high in fat content.",

      "title": "[Management of infantile colics].",
      "abstract": "Infantile colic concerns about 10-30% of all newborns and has been defined as a condition characterized by paroxysmal episodes of unexplained full force crying for at least three days a week and continuing for one week or more in a thriving well-nourished infant. The disorder more likely occurs in the evening, without identifiable causes and resolves spontaneously by the fourth month of life. The several factors involved in the etiopathogenesis (food intolerance or allergy to cow's milk protein, intolerance to lactose, intestinal hyperperistalsis, neuro-hormonal immaturity, maternal anxiety and familial stress), make the management of infants with colics difficult. We propose a scoring system for the evaluation of colics in infants based on: 1) crying intensity and duration; 2) accompanying characteristics of crises (e.g. meteorism, family history for allergic disease, type of feeding, type of stools); 3) evaluation of parents' opinion of their infants' crying. Type of management is based on the score: a) crying that is unrelated to colics: treatments referred to specific diagnosis. b) crying that is related to colics but not severe: first and second step of management; c) crying that is related to colics and is severe: third step of management.first step: pacifier, rocking, dull continuous background noise, hot water bottle on the abdomen, herbal tea, simethicone. Second step: pharmacological treatment and periodic controls. Pharmacological treatment include antispastic drugs (e.g. cimetropium bromide). Third step: dietary modification and/or pharmacological treatment: mothers of breast-fed infants are given a diet with no milk or products containing its proteins, or fish, or eggs. Infants who are not breast-fed receive soy milk and if symptoms continue soy milk is substituted with hydrolyzed casein milk formula. Pharmacological treatment include antispastic drugs (e.g. cimetropium bromide and in non responders dicyclomine hydrochloride). Dietary modifications appear more suitable than pharmacological treatment in resolving symptoms, since side effects of drugs have been described and our recent results indicate appropriate dietary modifications offer better results than pharmacological treatment in resolving crises. However, before interrupting dietary modifications and reintroducing cow's milk proteins, infant's tolerance to such proteins is tested. In any case because of the good prognosis and rapid regression of symptoms, dietary regimens or pharmacological treatment should only be applied if really necessary and for brief periods under medical supervision.",

      "abstract": "Swallowing is a dynamic process that requires more than 30 muscles in the recruitment/coordination of the lips, tongue, palate, pharynx, larynx and esophagus. The eating and swallowing procedure is learned in sensitive or critical periods: when a certain degree of maturation has been achieved, the appropriate stimulus permits a certain milestone of development to occur. The swallowing procedure occurs in three main stages oral, pharyngeal, and esophageal. Therefore, swallowing disorders may present in any, some, or all of these stages in addition to feeding problems. Adult dysphagia, or difficulty swallowing, has long been reported in the literature. Infants and children also experience feeding disorders and swallowing problems, either because of developmental disorders, syndromes, behavioral or neurological conditions, respiratory problems, and/or gastroesophageal reflux, eosinophilic esophagitis or anatomical deficits. Feeding problems or dysphagia are seen in up to 25% of all children; approximately 40% of prematurely born infants have swallowing disorders, up to 64-78% with developmental disorders and up to 99% with cerebral palsy. Diagnostic options include health status, broad social environment, parent-child interactions, and parental concerns. Evaluation of dysphagia and feeding disorders involves a multifactorial approach. Imaging studies may include videofluoroscopy and/or fiberoptic evaluation of swallowing (FEES). Successful oral feeding must be measured in quality of meal time experiences with best possible oral sensorimotor skills and safe swallowing while not jeopardizing a child's functional health status or the parent-child relationship. An interdisciplinary team approach enables coordinated global assessment and therapy planning.",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics STXBP1 encephalopathy with epilepsy is characterized by early-onset encephalopathy with epilepsy (i.e., moderate-to-severe intellectual disability, refractory seizures, and ongoing epileptiform activity). The median age of onset of seizures is six weeks (range 1 day to 13 years). Seizure types can include infantile spasms; generalized tonic-clonic, clonic, or tonic seizures; and myoclonic, focal, atonic, and absence seizures. Epilepsy syndromes can include Ohtahara syndrome, West syndrome, Lennox-Gaustaut syndrome, and Dravet syndrome (not SCN1A-related), classic Rett syndrome (not MECP2-related), and atypical Rett syndrome (not CDKL5-related). The EEG is characterized by focal epileptic activity, burst suppression, hypsarrhythmia, or generalized spike-and-slow waves. Other findings can include abnormal tone, movement disorders (especially ataxia and dystonia), and behavior disorders (including autism spectrum disorder). Feeding difficulties are common. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis is established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous intragenic pathogenic variant in STXBP1 or a contiguous gene deletion that includes STXBP1 and adjacent genes on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Developmental delay, cognitive dysfunction, and intellectual disability are managed in the usual manner. The most commonly used anti-seizure medications (ASMs) are phenobarbital, valproic acid, and vigabatrin; an estimated 20% of individuals require more than one ASM and approximately 25% are refractory to ASM therapy. Severe dystonia, dyskinesia, and choreoathetosis can be treated with monoamine depleters or dopaminergic agents. Behavior disorders and feeding difficulties are managed symptomatically in the usual manner. Surveillance: Neuropsychological assessment and EEG are performed as needed. Genetic counseling STXBP1 encephalopathy with epilepsy is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. To date, most probands represent simplex cases (i.e., a single occurrence in a family) and have the disorder as a result of a de novo STXBP1 pathogenic variant. Individuals with STXBP1 encephalopathy with epilepsy are not known to reproduce. Once the STXBP1 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

Symptoms improved with enteral hydration or intravenous fluid. In the absence of identifiable cause for their child symptoms and the apparent feed/symptom association, the family wanted to explore all options, including parenteral nutrition (PN).\n\nNeurodisability is an umbrella term used to describe a heterogeneous group affected by central nervous and/or neuromuscular deficit. Their motor functional output can be objectively assessed by Gross Motor Functional Classification,1 but the group comprises a diverse and often overlapping range of difficulties. The enteric nervous system, a semiautonomous part of the nervous system responsible for regulating the gastrointestinal (GI) function, is invariably affected with neurodisabilities and can drive some GI complaints.2 With increasing longevity of children on the extreme end of neurodisability, a new chapter of complex GI symptoms begins to unravel, and novel terminologies, such as GI dystonia, although poorly understood, are fast becoming embedded in medical jargons.\n\nPN is classically used to provide nutrition when the GI tract is unable to support sufficient nourishment. In most children, the requirement of PN is temporary, but minority will need long-term nutritional support, home PN and intestinal transplantation.3 In the neurologically able child, healthcare professionals can navigate this journey supported with guidelines and a plethora of evidence,4 but are left to the ambiguity of anecdotal evidence and personal experience to deal with the neurodisabled child who develops declining gut function, leading to variation in practice and divergence of care.\n\nWith the right level of multidisciplinary support and nutrition support teams, PN can sustain the nutritional need throughout childhood and transition to …",

      "title": "Swallowing Disorders and Rehabilitation Techniques",
      "abstract": "Dysphagia may be defined as \"difficulty moving food from the mouth to the stomach\" (M. Donner, Dysphagia, 1, 1988) and encompasses impaired airway protection and problems with secretion management. There are a variety of neurological and neuromuscular conditions that can impair the oral, pharyngeal and esophageal phases of swallowing and cause dysphagia in infants and children. Neurologic conditions can be acute in onset (e.g. hemorrhagic, infectious, inflammatory, traumatic, cerebral infarctions) or chronic (e.g. cerebral palsy, genetic disorders, encephalopathy, myopathy, neuropathy). There are various conditions that will cause neurogenic dysphagia that are also progressive in nature and can worsen in adulthood (e.g. Arnold-Chiari malformation, intracranial malignancies, dystonia, metabolic disorders, degenerative cortical conditions). These various conditions can progress rapidly or may be subtle and slow in their emergence. Symptoms of dysphagia in infants and children include: failure to thrive, meal-time distress, spitting, vomiting, choking, coughing and gagging during meals, refusing food, excessive oral secretions, oral-tactile hypersensitivity, aspiration-related respiratory conditions, and gastroesophageal or pharyngeal reflux. The ability to swallow, suck and breathe are completely developed at birth. Recent ultrasound studies of the fetus indicate that suckling is present between the 18th and 24th week and that by 34 weeks in-utero a regular burst-pause pattern of swallow is present. This burst-pause pattern together with a stable airway are prerequisites for normal infant feeding. By the time a child is between 18 to 24 months of age, independent self-feeding for most foods is well established. The normal anatomical and physiological development of the infant swallow will be presented and contrasted with the adult swallow. Conditions that impair this normal pattern of swallow will be presented and their symptoms discussed as they relate to infants and children. When problems persist beyond 6 months of age \"intervention usually is required to resolve difficulties with spoon feeding, cupdrinking, chewing, self-feeding skills and suckling\" (Sheppard, 1997, p.57). Table Feeding disorders and dysphagia in infants and children can be both physiological or behavioral in nature. If the child is unable to eat successfully or displays negative and aversive behaviors during mealtimes, problems in parent-child interactions may emerge that place unusual stresses on the family. Stress may contribute to creation of persistent behavioral abnormalities and aversive meal-times reactions. Therefore it is important that swallowing intervention is initiated as early as possible to avoid the pervasive problems that may occur in children who are not eating normally. A thorough medical/behavioral history and clinical feeding evaluation must be conducted before starting treatment. This evaluation should be family-centered and include observations during feeding. Because management of these children may be complicated, multidisciplinary team evaluations should be conducted. The members of this team may include pediatricians, gastroenterologists, neurologists, speech-language pathologists, nurses, physical and occupational therapists, radiologists, otalaryngologists, pharmacists and psychologists to develop a diagnosis and plan of management. Provision of treatment of dysphagia is usually conducted by the speech-language pathologist trained in pediatric dysphagia and includes: therapeutic strategies for nonnutritive oral stimulation, airway and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) management, habilitation of feeding, drooling, nutritional and mealtime management techniques. For those children who have been intubated, management includes teaching techniques that will facilitate transitioning from nonoral to oral feeding. Successful rehabilitation of children with swallowing disorders requires knowledge of the parameters of normal and abnormal oral pharyngeal and esophageal swallowing plus skill in the integration of a variety of essential therapeutics techniques.",

It is a fairly common problem in paediatric age: approximately 1 child out of 5 is affected at 5 years of age, with a potential significant impact on their quality of life and family. Pathogenesis is multifactorial, resulting in a combination of genetic factors, delayed maturation of the central nervous system, night-time anti-diuretic hormone deficiency and, in case, coexisting conditions such as sleep and behavioural disorders. Adequate diagnosis and management can speed up resolution, which usually occurs spontaneously, and identify those cases underlying an organic cause. Diagnosis is clinical. Instrumental investigation (such as ultrasound or urodynamic tests) is reserved to selected cases. Treatment mainly involves behavioural approach alongside, in those in which this approach fails, nocturnal alarm and/or pharmacological therapy. Assessment of associated comorbidities is crucial (ex. constipation, sleep and behavioural disorders).",

Primary eating disorders on the other hand are complex behavioral disturbances which do not result directly from changes in appetite. In this category are obesity, anorexia nervosa, and bulimia. The conditions of obesity and anorexia nervosa have been accepted for many years as clinical problems, and their history can be traced far back in the annals of medicine. The situation in regard to bulimia is rather different, since it has been recognized only recently as a subject of medical concern. The purpose of the present paper is to review the emergence of bulimia in the medical literature, discuss its status as a disorder, and advise caution before it is uncritically accepted as an illness entity.",

      "abstract": "Gastrointestinal functions such as food intake, propulsive peristalsis, inhibition of reflux, secretion, digestion and defecation are controlled by a complex autonomous neurohumoral system, which is influenced by higher cortical impulses. Life stress may modulate these impulses and in this way cause two types of gastrointestinal reactions. Psychophysiological reactions involve accentuations, inhibition or distortion of the pattern of function of gastrointestinal organs without changes in their structure. Examples of this type of reaction are often painful accentuation of bowel movements in patients with the irritable bowel syndrome, and increased gastric secretion elicited by emotional stress. Psychosomatic reactions lead to morphological changes in the end organ, e.g. activation of peptic ulcer or ulcerative colitis. Psychophysiological reactions may be important in the onset of symptoms in some functional diseases, e.g. in the irritable bowel syndrome. These patients need support from the physician, but specific psychiatric therapy is required only in cases with severe psychopathology, e.g. in patients with anorexia nervosa. The role of psychosomatic reactions in the development of organic gastrointestinal diseases is still unclear, as is the value of specific psychiatric therapy in the treatment of diseases such as peptic ulcer or ulcerative colitis. If this kind of therapy has some effect, it may be directed mainly towards subjective symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Constipation can manifest as hard (and often large-diameter) stools, infrequent and painful bowel movements or faecal incontinence, and represents a common complaint in childhood. More than 95% of constipated children suffer from functional constipation (FC), a common condition for both general practitioners and paediatric gastroenterologists. A prompt diagnosis and correct therapy are the keys for a successful management of children with FC. To provide the right diagnosis of FC, a thorough history and attentive physical examination suffice in most cases, according to the ROME IV Criteria (2016). Rarely, depending on the individual condition (and presence of the alarm signs), other diseases (like Hirschsprung's disease, anatomic abnormalities, metabolic or endocrine disorders) have to be ruled out. Non-pharmacological measures include diet, toilet training and a relaxing familial attitude towards the child. Pharmacological approach includes disimpaction, maintenance of a normal intestinal transit and progressive weaning of medication. In some cases, psychological approach is also necessary. Disimpaction can be performed with high-dose of polyethylene glycol (PEG) or daily enemas. For maintenance, osmotic laxatives (especially PEG) are the first choice after the age of 6 months; in children less than 6 months of age or in those not tolerating PEG, Lactulose can be used. Other laxatives (like mineral oil, milk of magnesia and stimulant laxatives) are recommended as additional (or second-line) treatment. The golden rules of therapy are: give adequate doses, for enough long time and stop gradually. Parents have to be informed that sometimes relapses are possible, when treatment is discontinued. A multidisciplinary treatment is rarely required. Even if the management of CF is well defined, the practice shows the contrary: diagnosis is often delayed, children are submitted to multiple and unnecessary investigations and treatment is not properly considered, with digestive and psychosocial consequences. I present the most frequent mistakes encountered in patients referred to me and possibilities to avoid these errors. It is imperative that physicians become familiar with diagnosing FC, in order to provide a proper management and prevent complications.",

Este trastorno puede manifestarse en una pérdida de peso significativa y/o deficiencia nutricional y/o una marcada interferencia en el funcionamiento psicosocial.

      "title": "questions and answers about the neurology of gluten sensitivity",
      "abstract": "In recent years there has been a plethora of articles claiming that various neurological syndromes are associated with or are caused by gluten sensitivity. However, the busy clinical neurologist needs to know the answers to just two main questions – does gluten sensitivity predispose patients to the development of various neurological complications, and should a patient with a cryptogenic neurological illness be investigated for occult gluten sensitivity (and if so how)? WHAT IS GLUTEN SENSITIVITY? Coeliac disease is a classic gluten sensitive enteropathy, typically presenting in childhood. It is common with a prevalence of between 1 : 80 and 1 : 300. There is characteristic small bowel villous atrophy (Fig. 1a) associated with abdominal pain, malabsorption and weight loss. A gluten-free diet rapidly reverses this atrophy (within weeks) (Fig. 1b), corrects malabsorption and leads to symptomatic improvement. In addition, patients may sometimes present with non-specific or trivial complaints and the diagnosis",

      "abstract": "Abstract Oro-Pharyngeal Dysphagia - or simply dysphagia - is the difficulty (persistent) in swallowing/passing food and/or liquid from the mouth to the pharynx into the esophagus and finally the stomach; a deglutition disorder (a symptom, by definition, often due to neuro-degenerative/−muscular, drug-induced or localized structural pathologies such as head and neck tumors, lesions and associated surgical and/or radiation injuries) linked to severe consequences on Quality of Life (QoL), including malnutrition, dehydration, and even sudden death. Likewise, Temporo-Mandibular Jaw and Joint disorder(s) – or simply TMD – is a multifactorial etiological condition, regularly encountered in the dental office. Whether due to malocclusion, bruxism, stress and/or trauma, TMD destabilizes the whole cranio-mandibular system structurally and functionally, via affecting mastication, teeth, supporting structures, comfort and aesthetics, and thus, QoL, again. While several treatment regimens do exist for such conditions, some of which have been standardized for use over the years, most continue to lack proper evidence-based literature support. Hence, (1) caution is to be exercised; and (2) the need for alternative therapeutic strategies is amplified, subsequently, the door for innovation is wide open. Indeed, neuromuscular electrical stimulation or “NMES”, is perhaps a fine example. Herein, we present the interested oro-dental health care provider with an up-dated revision of this therapeutic modality, its potential benefits, risks and concerns, to best handle the dysphagic patient: an intra-disciplinary approach or strategy bridging contemporary dentistry with speech and language therapy; a rather obscure and un-discovered yet critical allied health profession . A pre-clinical and clinical prospectus on employing inventive NMES-based regimens and devices to manage TMD is also highlighted.",

      "abstract": "Feeding and eating disorders (FEDs) are serious mental health disorders that cause impairments in physical health, development, cognition and psychosocial function and can go undetected for months or years. They are characterised by disturbed eating behaviour associated with concerns about weight and shape or by disinterest in food, phobic avoidance or avoidance due to sensory aspects of food. Restrictive forms of FEDs lead to significant weight loss requiring intervention. Without specific knowledge of these conditions, they can evade detection, delaying time to diagnosis and treatment and potentially influencing outcome. This review article focuses on the key factors involved in the psychiatric assessment and treatment of four feeding or eating disorders (EDs): anorexia nervosa, avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder, bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder. They have been chosen for discussion as they are most likely to be encountered in both a psychiatric and paediatric setting. It emphasises the importance of a family-focused, developmentally appropriate and multidisciplinary approach to care. It does not address aspects of medical assessment and treatment. Other feeding or EDs not included in this article are pica, rumination disorder, other specified feeding and eating disorder and unspecified feeding and eating disorder.",

      "title": "Orthorexia nervosa – a different lifestyle or a specific eating disorder?",
      "abstract": "Orthorexia nervosa (ON) is considered an obsession with healthy eating, a phenomenon that includes excessive dietary restrictions, which in turn can lead to metabolic dysfunctions. Although the nosological status of this pathology is currently insufficiently determined, ON attracts the interest of mental health specialists due to the possible harmful psychological and biological consequences, its high prevalence in the general population and the difficulty of adequate therapeutic management (low level of insight and lack of evidence-based treatments). Orthorexia nervosa should be distinguished from other mental disorders with which it has a high degree of clinical overlap (obsessive-compulsive disorder, anorexia nervosa, restrictive/avoidant eating disorder etc.), but also from “healthy orthorexia” (this being considered part of a lifestyle focused on eliminating foods labeled as “impure”, “toxic” or “artificial”). The analysis of risk factors for ON highlights the importance of several obsessive-compulsive personality traits (perfectionism, rigidity, self-control), executive dysfunctions, internalization of social models (thinness or perfect health, for example), media pressure, parental and social group influences, belonging to certain professional categories (nutritionists, medical students, athletes) or practicing yoga. Several psychometric instruments for measuring the severity of ON have been developed over the last two decades, but they should be used with caution because not all of them have well-established validity. Also, several sets of diagnostic criteria have been proposed in order to identify the clinical features of orthorexia nervosa and to differentiate these patients from those diagnosed with anorexia nervosa, obsessive-compulsive disorder, somatoform disorders or nonpathological orthorexic behaviors. Finally, some therapeutic suggestions are presented, mainly psychotherapies, but it should be mentioned that they are based on case studies or on the extrapolation of data from trials dedicated to pathologies considered to be related to orthorexia nervosa. In conclusion, because ON is a nosological entity that has only recently been cornered, there is an urgent need to explore psychometric tools with higher specificity and to find more widely accepted diagnostic criteria. Also, no clear, evidence-based therapeutic recommendations could yet be formulated, because no clinical trial focused on the effectiveness of therapeutic interventions in patients with orthorexia nervosa has been conducted.",

In addition to poor linear growth, there is a decrease in muscle strength and coordination, impaired cerebral function leading to decreased motivation and energy. Significant neurodevelopmental progress can be achieved with improved nutritional status. A multidisciplinary approach, with input from neurologists, gastroenterologists, nurses, occupational therapists, and dieticians, can make a major contribution to the medical wellbeing and quality of life of these children. Different neurological diseases (eg, spinal dysraphism, syringomyelia, tethered cord syndromes) can give rise to gastrointestinal dysfunction and symptoms that may need different gastrointestinal or surgical management. The introduction of new drugs, including proton pump inhibitors and innovative endoscopic and surgical techniques in the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease and constipation also may have an impact on the treatment of neurologically handicapped children in the future.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Magnesium deficiency may complicate many diseases. The causes include the following: inadequate intake during starvation or increased requirement during early childhood, pregnancy, or lactation; excessive losses of magnesium as a result of malabsorption from the gastrointestinal tract or from the kidneys during use of diuretics; and to a combination of the two, as in alcoholism. Most often the etiological factors have been operative for a month or more. Acute hypo‐magnesemia can occur without previous Mg deficiency after epinephrine, cold stress and stress of serious injury or extensive surgery. The clinical manifestations depend on the age of the patient and may begin insidiously or with dramatic suddenness, or there may be no overt symptoms or signs. The manifestations can be divided into the following categories: totally non‐specific symptoms and signs ascribable to the primary disease; neuromuscular hyperactivity including tremor, myoclonic jerks, convulsions, Chvostek sign, Trousseau sign (rarely), spontaneous carpopedal spasm (rarely), ataxia, nystagmus and dysphagia; psychiatric disturbances from apathy and coma to some or all facets of delirium; cardiac arrhythmias including ventricular fibrillation and sudden death; hypocalcemia which is responsive only to Mg therapy; and hypokalemia which is not easily nor completely corrected without Mg therapy. The diversity of etiologies and the multiplicity of manifestations result in confusion and controversy. The documentation of normal renal function is absolutely necessary for maximum doses. The order of magnitude of dose is 1.0 meq Mg/kg on day 1, and 0.3 to 0.5 mEq/kg per day for 3 to 5 days. In emergencies such as convulsions or ventricular arrhythmias, a bolus injection of 1.0 gm (8.1 meq) of MgSO 4 is indicated. Therapy of Mg deficiency in the presence of renal insufficiency requires smaller doses and frequent monitoring. Complete repletion occurs slowly.",

The mechanism by which RS ensues is because of the habitual contraction of the abdominal wall muscles leading to increased intra-abdominal pressure and regurgitation of gastric contents. Therefore, diaphragmatic breathing techniques and biofeedback are helpful in these patients to counteract the habitual abdominal contractions. We present a case of a 26-year-old woman diagnosed with RS unresponsive to conventional therapy (antiemetics and antispasmodics).",

      "abstract": "Abdominal pain/discomfort, bloating, need to rush to the toilet, straining, feeling of incomplete bowel emptying and alternating periods of diarrhea and constipation is the clinical definition of the irritable bowel syndrome. The internationally used syndrome definition is based on expert opinions and answers to patient questionnaires. When symptoms are registered prospectively, abdominal pain starts or worsens after meals and is not relieved by defecation. As in the general population patients with the syndrome define diarrhea as loose stools and constipation as hard stools regardless of stool frequencies. Variation in defecatory symptoms and discrepancies between these symptoms and stool consistency are the hallmarks of the syndrome, and the degree of variation per fortnight is relatively stable in the individual patient. Fermentation of carbohydrates by colonic bacteria, increased sensitivity to bowel distention by gas, gas-producing food, increased secretion of cholecystokinin after fatty meals and/or increased sympathetic nerve tone at stress can give rise to symptoms. Symptoms can start after a single period of bacterial gastroenteritis. Although patients seeking medical care for the syndrome are more often anxious, the syndrome itself is not psychosomatic. Symptoms are possibly mediated through partial degranulation of mast cells in bowel mucosa, but this does not make it an allergic disease. If bowel dysmotility can be measured, early stage or a mild case of intestinal pseudoobstruction should be considered. Hyperreactivity in the enteric nervous system and/or in the brain is the likely main cause of the symptoms. More widespread activity in the brain after exposure to stimuli originating from bowel nerves or less inhibition of this stimulation in the brain are possible mechanisms.",

Mada / Madonmada is caused by various traumatic events or extreme stressors, and it is characterized by various features such as pradhyayati (immersed in thoughts/flashbacks/recurrent or persistent distressing thoughts), praswapati (excessive sleep), animittitam rodati (crying without any reason/pervasive negative emotions/depressed mood), akasmaat hasati (laughing inappropriately or without any reason/disorganized behavior), nidraalu (hypersomnia/excessive sleep), alpa vaak (diminished speech or poverty of speech/social withdrawal), nityam utsuka (hypervigilant/restlessness), trasta shareeri (tiredness/weakness), deenaaksha (depression/pervasive negative emotions), krodhana (angry outbursts/irritable behavior), nirapatrapa (self-destructive behavior/recklessness), purastaat avalokee (exaggerated startle response), na yathavritta eva (disorganized or abnormal behavior), parushatva of roma (roughness or dryness of skin and hair), and aavilam chakshusha (confused/teary eyes). Mada / Madonmada has shown similarity with various psychiatric conditions such as “acute stress disorder,” “posttraumatic stress disorder,” “brief psychotic disorder,” and “adjustment disorder.” The present study provides insights for clinical implementation of “ Mada / Madonmada ” in the diagnosis and management of “trauma- and stressor-related disorders” in terms of Ayurveda . It is astonishing that thousands of years before, “ Acharya Bhela ” has documented the conditions such as trauma- and stressor-related disorders in the form of Mada or Madonmada .",

      "abstract": "Normal and optimal functioning of the gastrointestinal tract is paramount to ensure optimal nutrition through digestion, absorption and motility function. Disruptions in these functions can lead to adverse physiological symptoms, reduced quality of life and increased nutritional risk. When disruption or dysfunction of neuromuscular function occurs, motility disorders can be classified depending on whether coordination or strength/velocity of peristalsis are predominantly impacted. However, due to their nonspecific presenting symptoms and overlap with sensory disruption, they are frequently misdiagnosed as disorders of the gut–brain interaction. Motility disorders are a prevalent issue in the pediatric population, with management varying from medical therapy to psychological therapy, dietary manipulation, surgical intervention or a multimodal approach. This narrative review aims to discuss the dietary management of common pediatric motility disorders including gastroesophageal reflux, esophageal atresia, achalasia, gastroparesis, constipation, and the less common but most severe motility disorder, pediatric intestinal pseudo-obstruction.",

      "abstract": "All those involved in the care of babies need to maintain a high index of suspicion regarding the possibility of seizures. Not only are seizures common in the first few days of life, but they are also difficult to diagnose because the clinical manifestations are varied, subtle, and unlike those seen at other times of life. The diagnosis of seizure should be considered if a baby makes odd repetitive stereotyped movements of the limbs or face. Subtle seizures can manifest as repetitive blinking, chewing, eye-rolling or darting tongue movements. Seizures can also involve a stare without blinking, forced eye deviation, peculiar limb postures, apnea or a fixed smile. Ocular manifestations are common, and eye closure during a suspicious event makes the diagnosis of seizure less likely, although it does not exclude it completely [1]. Myoclonic jerks can be normal in sleep but myoclonic epilepsy does occasionally manifest in the neonatal period. Clinical seizures are often short-lived in babies; typically the baby becomes still, there is a change in breathing pattern (sometimes apnea), and a change in level of alertness followed by subtle repetitive movements involving the face or limbs. The whole episode may be over in less than a minute, but the same pattern does tend to recur, in which case it becomes more suspicious.",

Anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa as known in the DSM-IV as eating disorders are characterized by physically and/or psychologically harmful eating patterns. Although the psychological explanation of what we now call anorexia nervosa have been known about for centuries, it has only recently attracted much interest, due to greater public knowledge and increased incidence (according to Gross and MclLveen 2006, the latter claim has been disputed). Most people suffering from anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa start by fasting. Anorexia nervosa is a deliberate self-starvation. A person whose body weight is less than expected for his or her body height and weight is considered to be anorexic. In contract, bulimia involves binge eating a large quantity of food followed by purging by self-induced vomiting, enemas, laxatives, or diuretics.",

It mostly begins in infancy or during the first three years of life and has been found more in boys than in girls. The symptoms of ASD often include language regression, motor regression, and loss of bowel and bladder use. ASD also affects the feeding habit of children, with rates up to 74% as compared to normally developing children. Among different problems related to feeding, food selectivity is one of the key problems as it is directly linked with inadequate nutrition. Different factors affecting food selectivity are restrictive and repetitive behaviors, sensory modulation disorder, sensory over responsively, frequent illness /physical discomfort, and family preferences of food. Food selectivity among the children with ASD has been reported to be as high as 46- 89% as compared to typically developing children. Enough research on linkage of food selectivity with age and other factors is yet to be confirmed. Knowledge and awareness in parents regarding autism and food selectivity may help immensely to diagnose and address feeding problems in ASD at early stage.",

In the normal infant or the medically fragile infant due to prematurity or an acute episode, complaints from the patient or family sources force the medical team to find an explanation or a treatment, which are not always adequate. In other conditions such as asthma, obesity, anorexia nervosa, autism, cerebral palsy, hyperactivity, the sleeping disorders may be so unnoticed or remain insufficiently investigated. Globally, in this domain, the clinical description is often imprecise and sleep studies underused.

      "abstract": "Eating disorders are serious illnesses affecting 1–2% of young women. Patients may present to any doctor, sometimes atypically (e.g. unexplained weight loss, food allergy, infertility, diarrhoea), delaying diagnosis and leading to needless investigation. The cardinal signs are weight loss, amenorrhoea, bingeing with vomiting and other compensatory behaviours, and disturbances in body image with an exaggeration of the importance of slimness. When other causes have been excluded, useful investigations are serum potassium, bone mineral density scanning and pelvic ultrasound. In emaciated patients multiple systems may fail with pancytopaenia, neuromyopathy and heart failure. Clinical assessment of muscle power is used to monitor physical risk. Treatment may involve individual, group or family sessions, using cognitive‐behavioural, psychodynamic and family approaches. More severe or intractable illness is treated with day care, with in‐patient care in a medical or specialist psychiatric unit reserved for the most severely ill patients. Antidepressants have a place in the treatment of bulimia nervosa unresponsive to psychological approaches, and when severe depressive symptoms develop. The children of people with eating disorders may have an increased risk of difficulties. Support for the patient and family, and effective liaison between professionals, are essential in the treatment of severe eating disorders.",

Symptoms related to disorders of stomach function are commonly meal-related; \"dyspepsia\" symptoms of epigastric fullness; or bloating, discomfort, and nausea in the postprandial period. Early satiety and prolonged stomach fullness are often present, and in severe cases the patient may vomit undigested food. Neuromuscular disorders of stomach function should not be considered until structural and metabolic diseases that may also cause these nonspecific symptoms are excluded. A thorough history, routine laboratory studies, ultrasound of the gallbladder and pancreas, and upper endoscopy will exclude the majority of diseases that may cause dyspepsia symptoms. Disorders of gastric neuromuscular function may be detected by solid-phase gastric emptying studies which detect gastroparesis and by electrogastrography which detects abnormalities of gastric myoelectrical activity termed gastric dysrhythmias. Invasive tests to determine abnormalities in gastric motility include intraluminal pressure and gastric tone/compliance recordings. Treatment approaches are limited at the present time and include dietary counseling and gastroprokinetic agents such as metoclopromide, cisapride, and erythromycin. Increased understanding of the pathophysiology of disorders of gastric neuromuscular function will lead to an improved and more rational armamentarium for the treatment of symptoms related to functional disorders of the stomach.",

      "abstract": "In clinical practice the term &ldquo;megacolon&rdquo; is used to indicate a marked dilatation of the cecum and the sigmoid colon (&gt;12 and 6.5 cm, respectively) (1). From a clinical standpoint, a megacolon can be classified as chronic or acute depending on its clinical presentation. Chronic megacolon typically refers to a congenital disorder in which the enteric nervous system (ENS) supplying the colon does not develop properly, thereby leaving the distal segments of the viscus without myenteric and submucosal ganglia (i.e. Hirschsprung&rsquo;s disease) (2). Other cases of non-aganglionic chronic megacolon can be secondary to variety of conditions such as Chagas&rsquo; disease and neurodegenerative diseases (e.g. Parkinson&rsquo;s and Alzheimer&rsquo;s diseases), leading to or associated with ENS abnormalities (3). The acute form of megacolon, also referred to as Ogilvie&rsquo;s syndrome, is characterized by a predominant involvement of the cecum and right colon usually affecting elderly patients undergoing surgery (e.g. orthopedic procedures) or taking medications altering gut motility (e.g. opioids or antidepressants) (4). Some forms of acute megacolon, however, can be idiopathic in origin since no underlying etiology can be identified. Patients with acute idiopathic megacolon usually have a longstanding history of constipation, often accompanied by laxative abuse, and their clinical presentation is characterized by abdominal distension and severe pain with radiological evidence of stool impacted in the colon and rectum (1, 4). The case herein reported represents an unusual form of acute idiopathic megacolon characterized by massive descending and sigmoid colon distension complicated with a volvulus in a 14-year-old boy with no Hirschsprung&rsquo;s disease. In addition, just to increase the peculiarity of this case report, the patient had an unremarkable clinical record, and never suffered from chronic constipation in the past.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Nervous system disorders may be accompanied by gastrointestinal (GI) dysfunction. Brain lesions may be responsible for GI problems such as decreased peristalsis (e.g., lesions in the basal ganglia, pontine defecation center/Barrington's nucleus), decreased abdominal strain (e.g., lesions in the parabrachial nucleus), hiccupping and vomiting (e.g., lesions in the area postrema), and appetite loss (e.g., lesions in the hypothalamus). Decreased peristalsis also may be caused by lesions of the spinal long tracts or the intermediolateral nucleus projecting to the myenteric plexus. This review addresses GI dysfunction caused by multiple sclerosis, neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder, and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein-associated disorder. Neuro-associated GI dysfunction may develop concurrently with brain or spinal cord dysfunction or may predate it. Collaboration between gastroenterologists and neurologists is highly desirable when caring for patients with GI dysfunction related to nervous system disorders, particularly since patients with these symptoms may visit a gastroenterologist prior to the establishment of a neurological diagnosis.",

      "abstract": "A brief history of a patient is given and an attempt is made to reconcile the clinical realities she presents with the various diagnostic criteria that have been proposed for eating disorders. Despite much deliberation and many formulations, no scheme fully encompasses her not-uncommon problem. Rather than tinker yet again with the criteria for the syndromes of anorexia and bulimia nervosa, or introduce yet another new condition such as binge eating disorder, the authors suggest a unitary approach to diagnosis. Emphasis should be placed on the preoccupation with weight loss, the illness should be conceptualized as a dieting disorder rather than an eating disorder, and patient status should be accorded only when the disturbance results in significant psychological or physical ill-effects. The term anorexia nervosa should be retained for such cases, and all anorexia nervosa patients should be categorized on three parameters, viz: their current state of nutrition; the presence or absence of significant purging behaviors; and whether or not they have binge eating episodes. © 1994 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.",

      "title": "Prevalence of Irritable Bowel Syndrome in Northern India",
      "abstract": "Irritable syndrome (IBS) is a recurrent disorder characterised by chronic abdominal pain or discomfort (often bloating), in association with altered generation and interpretation of function, which is not accompanied by anatomical anomalies or biochemical abnormalities. Symptoms tend to vary in manifestation and time course, worsen during flares, and affect patient's quality of life.1 A dysregulation of the brain-gut axis that interacts with visceral hypersensitivity and associated with observed digestive motor disturbances and micro-inflammation of the gut, with possibly an imbalance of the intestinal bio-flora. These are factors that may be responsible for the symptoms generation. Psychosocial stressors may then interact with biological factors and are modulated by cultural beliefs and practices resulting in variations on observed symptoms constellation and health seeking behaviours, a biopsychosocial disorder.\r\n\r\nA better outcome is achievable if a positive diagnosis of IBS is made, based on clinical symptoms (in the absence of alarm signs) alone, rather than making a diagnosis by exclusion. Several diagnostic exist and each new criterion refers to the insufficiencies of the previous ones. The most commonly accepted diagnostic include the original Manning and the subsequent series of foundation defined criteria. A formal definition according to the Rome III is recurrent abdominal pain or discomfort for at least 3 days per month during the previous 3 months associated with two or more of the following with onset at least 6 months before diagnosis: (1) symptoms improvement with defecation, (2) onset associated with a change in the frequency of stools and (3) onset associated with a change in form or appearance of stools.1-4\r\n\r\nThe prevalence of IBS varies across the world, ranging from as high as 10%-20% in the West,5,6 to as low as 4.2% in India.7 There is a perception that IBS is less of a problem in Asia and its epidemiology to be different. In addition, the prevalence rates of IBS itself vary in Asia with higher rates being documented from more affluent urban communities of Japan, Singapore and Guangzhou in China.8-10 Prevalence rates also differ within the same country (Beijing 7.3% and Guangzhou 12%) and within the same racial community from different countries.8,11,12 Such observed differences may be due to the different (Manning vs Rome II vs Rome III) used to diagnose IBS or due to a different target population studied. However more recently, Park et al13 reported similar prevalence rates using Rome II (8%) and Rome III (9%) in a Korean IBS population.\r\n\r\nIn this study Makharia et al reported a prevalence rate of 4% which is in good agreement (4.2%) with a previous study by Ghoshal et al.7 This is interesting as the population involved in both studies were quite different. Ghoshal looked at subjects from mainly the hospital/clinic setting (recruitment centres from Northern, Central and Southern India) while the present study was solely community based (Northern India). Furthermore Makharia's group used a questionnaire based on the new Rome III module while Ghoshal's local criteria was more clinical and practical. Yet the resulting prevalence rates from both centers were quite similar. The observed prevalence rate is low compared to data from other Asian centers and also lower than the Western prevalence rates. We would expect lower prevalence rates from a rural community in Northern India, as IBS is recognized to be a disorder of developed nations and communities.8-10 However, Ghoshal's hospital based study confirmed that the prevalence rate is indeed low in India.\r\n\r\nOne possible explanation for the low prevalence rate could be from the use of different diagnostic tools or for the detection of a variable condition that is solely symptom based. One of the weaknesses of this study is that the used questionnaire was not validated for the study population. This might affect the quality of data acquired. However, a study from Nam et al14 using validated Rome III in Korea gave a prevalence rate of 8.2% which is still lower than the prevalence rates observed from communities in Europe or America.\r\n\r\nAnother unique observation is the much higher incidence of diarrhea predominant IBS (1.5%) compared to IBS constipation (0.3%). This was also reported from Ghoshal's study who also suggested that in general, Indians tend to pass 1-2 soft stool per day. This may be due to the higher fiber intake and faster gut transit time. Is it possible that another form of functional bowel or IBS exist in this sub-continent which is different from the West? Western patients tend to be more neurotic compared to the Asian patients who are more likely to be post infectious. This difference may also arise from other contributing factors such as race, different cultural practices, variation in food intake and co-existing lactose intolerance.\r\n\r\nThe other notable difference reported from this study is the increasing prevalence of IBS with advancing age, with the maximum in the 50-60 age groups. Across Asia, it has been noted that the prevalence of IBS is higher in the younger age group.8,9,11,12,15,16 In a rural community where the younger folks need to work hard for daily sustenance, symptoms of abdominal discomfort or alteration of pattern is often too trivial to be considered as abnormal enough to visit the hospital. The time of day in which the study was conducted in this native rural community of Northern India would also be important.\r\n\r\nThe often quoted male preponderance in Asian Indian IBS population was not demonstrated in this study. The prevalence of IBS was significantly higher in females compared with males. In the previous study by Ghoshal et al7 the subset of complainants in the study group showed a distinct predominance of male gender (68% vs 32%). The explanation given by the authors is that in a male dominant society, the health seeking behaviour of males can best account for the disparity in prevalence rates seen in the hospital/clinic setting compared to a rural community setting.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, this study by Makharia et al is the first large scale IBS study in India using the Rome III criteria. However, this study has few limitations. Firstly, the diagnostic tool used, the Rome III questionnaire was not validated for this population. Secondly, it was also noted that the Glasgow pictorial stool chart was not used to determine stool forms. Even if patients can describe their stool forms adequately, pictorial definition is still the best method of evaluation since patient's perception is often very different from the actual stool form. Despite all of these, this study has contributed to a better understanding of the epidemiology of IBS in India, by providing an alternative view point to the more accepted norms.",

Symptoms may last for a few hours or persist for several days, spontaneous recovery is common. Familial cases can be distinguished from secondary, non-familial forms which are based on other diseases, for example, of the thyroid gland, kidneys or gastrointestinal tract. Familial cases are mostly inherited in an autosomal-dominant pattern and belong to the channelopathies. Both groups are characterised by changed potassium levels in the blood during an episode. A detailed and accurate medical history (plus family history, use of medication and eating habits) often easily leads to the diagnosis. Provoking tests or instrumental and histological investigations can help to solve difficult cases. Treatment focuses on relieving acute symptoms and attacks can be managed by correcting the blood potassium to a normal level.

      "title": "Hypoactive Delirium Caused by Pulmonary Embolus in an Elderly Adult",
      "abstract": "Delirium is frequently observed in individuals aged 65 and older (10–30%).1 Delirium has an acute onset—within hours to days—and exhibits a fluctuating course. Delirium is characterized by distorted attention, reduced awareness of the environment, alteration in at least one cognitive area (disturbed memory, orientation, language, perception), and change in sleep cycles.2 Because of the wide range of clinical presentation, clinicians often do not identify or misdiagnose cases of delirium individuals; hypoactive delirium presenting with lethargy, confusion, and indifference to the environment is the most difficult to diagnose subtype, despite being the most commonly occurring type in elderly adults.3 An 87-year-old woman was brought to the geriatric department because of forgetfulness (not recognizing her children), being introverted, distractibility, indifference to the environment, lack of appetite, refusal to take medications, and hallucinations such as seeing her deceased husband in the room for the previous 2 days. She had no known cognitive deficiency. Physical examination showed a heart rate of 102 beats per minute, respiration rate of 18 breaths per minute, and a body temperature of 37.4°C. All systemic examinations were normal. Assessment of mental condition revealed cognitive and perception problems with disturbances of memory and orientation. Psychomotor activity was found to be poor, and she gave short answers to questions during the interview and refused to talk. Based on these clinical findings and symptoms, the newly developed clinical picture was thought to be hypoactive delirium, and she was admitted to the geriatric service. Examination immediately after admission revealed a sinus rhythm electrocardiogram with no pathological characteristics. She had leukocytosis (13,000/μL). Biochemistry showed normal liver, thyroid, and kidney functions, with no electrolyte imbalance. Urinalysis showed no evidence of infection. No pneumonic consolidation or effusion was detected on chest X-ray. Brain tomography ordered to exclude cranial pathology due to acute mental alteration revealed no pathological findings. Sedimentation was 90 mm/h (normal <15 mm/h), C-reactive protein was 115 mg/L (normal 0.1–8.2 mg/L), and lumbar puncture performed to exclude aseptic meningitis and encephalitis was normal. On the fifth day, she was persistently encouraged to mobilize because she did not want to get out of bed and wished to sleep continuously, but she developed exertional dyspnea and syncope. D-dimer was 13,115 mg/L (normal 0–0.5 mg/L), so thoracic tomography was ordered. Filling defects at the main and segmental branches of the pulmonary arteries consistent with embolus were observed on both sides, being more prominent on the right side, and minimal pleural effusion was observed on the left side (Figure 1). Lower extremity venous Doppler ultrasonography findings were consistent with subacute deep vein thrombosis in the left lower extremity. She was started on 1 mg/kg of enoxaparin sodium twice daily, with the addition of warfarin on the third day. On the fifth day of anticoagulation therapy, the delirium was completely resolved, and she was discharged. During outpatient follow-up, warfarin treatment was regulated to maintain an international normalized ratio level of 2.5–3.5, and she developed no new delirium. Delirium is associated with poor functional capacity, likelihood of admission to a nursing home, mortality, morbidity, and admission to the hospital.4, 5 Hypoactive delirium is the most commonly encountered subtype in elderly adults. Unlike the other subtypes, individuals behave as if they are sedated and do not harm themselves or others; as a consequence, clinicians often do not identify such individuals or misdiagnose them with depression or dementia. Simple conditions such as untreated urinary system infection, constipation, and pain may cause delirium in elderly adults, although life-threatening conditions such as myocardial infarction and stroke can also cause it.6 Pulmonary embolus (PE) may not always cause typical symptoms as dyspnea; it is asymptomatic (32% of cases) or may present with atypical symptoms as acute confusion, chest and back pain, and syncope.7 Rarely, one of the atypical clinical presentations of PE may be delirium, as mentioned in this case report, and PE should be investigated in elderly adults presenting with delirium, even in the absence of typical symptoms. In conclusion, while assessing the etiology of delirium, clinicians should remember that one of the acute conditions leading to development of delirium is PE, particularly in elderly adults.

Recent findings Settings where people with anorexia nervosa are treated include their general practitioner, an independent psychiatric practice, a community mental health team (CMHT), a specialized eating disorder outpatient service, eating disorder early intervention services, a highly intensive eating disorder outpatient or home treatment programme, eating disorder daycare, an inpatient eating disorder service, a general hospital or a general psychiatric hospital, or residential treatment. At a specialized eating disorder service, patients should be offered evidence-based psychotherapy for anorexia nervosa, dietary advice and physical health monitoring as a first step. Additionally, they may be allocated to a specific treatment pathway, family interventions and creative therapies. As a second step, clinicians may consider integrating interventions targeting psychiatric or physical comorbidities, medication for anorexia nervosa or noninvasive neurostimulation. After several years of futile treatment, deep brain stimulation (DBS) should be considered to prevent a chronic course of anorexia nervosa. Nutritional interventions can be escalated from nutritional counselling to nasogastric tube feeding. Patients who rely on nasogastric tube feeding might benefit from percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG). Patients who vomit despite a nasogastric tube, might need nasojejunal tube feeding. Summary Treatment for people with anorexia nervosa should be regularly reviewed and, if necessary, escalated to avoid a chronic and longstanding disease course.",

It now receives the attention deserved of a symptom that affects a quarter of the population at some time. Most important is the recognition that different pathophysiological processes can result in the final common symptoms of decreased bowel frequency or impaired rectal evacuation. Different clinical syndromes require different therapeutic approaches.\n\nBowel frequency is influenced by several factors including intake of dietary fibre, emotional make up, and psychological morbidity. Introspective individuals have a lower bowel frequency and produce less stool than extroverts. Infrequent bowel actions in the absence of symptoms can be regarded as part of the normal spectrum of bowel frequency. Low bowel frequency is more common in women.\n\nControlled cross sectional studies have shown that psychological morbidity is commonly associated with severe constipation.1 In some patients it is the key causative factor. Other factors include childhood problems such as sexual or physical abuse, loss of a parent through death or separation, or disturbed toileting behaviour. Underlying depression is another cause. For some the gut is their “outlet valve” for the normal stresses of living. The pathways between brain and gut that link emotions to bowel function have been largely characterised and shown to involve cerebral corticotrophin releasing factor and efferent autonomic pathways.

      "abstract": "Functional constipation is a common problem in childhood, with an estimated prevalence of 3% worldwide. Constipation is defined as functional constipation FC if there is no underlying organic cause, which is the case in up to 95% of children. It can be seen in healthy children one year and older and is particularly common among preschool-aged children . Most individuals have bowel movements at regular intervals, and although the frequency varies from person to person, stools should pass without significant straining or discomfort. Functional constipation is often described as difficult or infrequent bowel movements/ deviation from normal frequency, painful defecation, the passage of hard stools, and/or sensation of incomplete evacuation of stool. It is often not caused by any underlying systemic cause or anatomical defect. It is usually multifactorial to include environmental conditions, stress, diet, coping skills, and social support.",

      "abstract": "Brief psychotic disorder (BPD) according to DSM-5 is the sudden onset of psychotic behavior that lasts less than 1 month followed by complete remission with possible future relapses. It is differentiated from schizophreniform disorder and schizophrenia by the duration of the psychosis. The diagnosis is often anticipatory or retrospective due to the diagnostic requirement of complete remission within 1 month. Brief psychotic disorder is an acute but transient disorder with the onset of one or more of the following psychotic symptoms: Delusions Hallucinations Disorganized speech Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior At least one of these symptoms must be delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech. The symptoms in BPD last between one day to one month, with a complete return to premorbid level of functioning after the disease course in response to antipsychotic medications. The disturbance in behavior cannot be better accounted for by schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, mood disorder with psychotic features, or be a direct result of a drug, medication, or medical condition like thyrotoxicosis, sarcoidosis, or syphilis.",

      "abstract": "The four main requirements for oral-motor development are stability and mobility of the ingestive system, rhythmicity, sensation, oral-motor efficiency and economy. Ingestion can be divided into oral, pharyngeal and esophageal stages. The main categories of pathology encountered in our swallowing and dysphagia clinic are encephalopathies (including cerebral palsy), genetic disorders (including chromosomal aberrations), syndromes associated with swallowing difficulty (e.g. Rett, Dandy-Walker, DiGeorge), head injuries, brain tumors, developmental delay and the oral deprivation syndrome (e.g. due to prolonged tube feeding on a preterm infant). The behavioral expression of the many different pathologies falls into three categories: (1) resistance to accepting food orally; (2) lack of energy and endurance to do the 'work' of eating; and (3) oral-motor disabilities resulting in an inability to produce the necessary motor skills for ingestion. Expect expression and exacerbation of feeding problems during periods of most active growth, i.e. from birth to 2 years and during the adolescent growth spurt. Identify the source of the feeding problem. Establish its pathology and note the clinical manifestations. Determine if the problem has a strictly physiologic origin or whether it may be exacerbated by the feeding interaction between child and feeder. Determine what diagnostic tests are needed and refer child for testing Formulate the treatment approach based on clinical observations and results of diagnostic tests.

The child and adolescent presenting with neuropsychiatric symptoms always needs a neuropsychiatric work-up comprising a psychiatric examination and a neurodevelopmental evaluation. Laboratory work-up of some kind is often required also as is a neuropsychological assessment. It is always difficult to draw the clinical line in deciding what is (and what is not) a ‘neuropsychiatric symptom’. Whenever there is a suspicion of a named disorder reflecting brain problems, a genetic disorder or when there are symptoms such as social withdrawal, empathy deficits, psychotic symptoms (hallucinations, delusions, confusion), pervasive attention deficits, learning problems, motor control problems, tics (motor or vocal), grossly disturbed eating behaviour, or significant weight loss in children or adolescents, a full neuropsychiatric work-up is always required. The neurodevelopmental work-up includes a detailed family history, review of the pregnancy and early developmental history, evaluation of social and academic settings and a developmental and neuromotor evaluation.",

      "abstract": "Eating disorders including anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN) have increased lately, and they are increasingly seen in routine clinical set- tings. Eating disorders are associated with abnormalities in eating behaviors such as fear of obesity, apocleisis, binge-eating, and self-vomiting. These abnormalities result in complications such as malnutrition. The physical effects of these disor- ders include extended periods of chronic hypotension, bradycardia, hypothermia, swelling of the salivary gland, caries, anemia, dehydration, hypokalemia, hypo- chloremia, and prolonged metabolic alkalosis. Therefore, renal failure or heart failure tends to occur due to these abnormalities. In addition, the possibility of sudden death due to arrhythmia is not uncommon. Gastric rupture may also occur due to binging or fierce vomiting. Secondary amenorrhea occurs in more than 90% of AN patients because of chronic malnutrition. Reduction of bone mass leads to an increased risk of bone fractures later in life. In addition, psychological compli- cations such as mood disorders, anxiety disorders, obsessive-compulsive disor- ders, and personality disorders are common, and it is important to note that domes- tic conflicts are manifested when patients develop eating disorders. Therefore, a multifaceted therapeutic approach, focused on the mental and physical aspects, is necessary in the treatment of eating disorders.",

The most frequent triggers of anaphylaxis in childhood are food, insect venom, drugs, exercise, etc. In some cases, the presence of more than one trigger is necessary for the allergic reaction, while one trigger alone is tolerated. This rare condition is called summation anaphylaxis (SA). Food‐dependent exercise‐induced anaphylaxis is the most well‐known SA. However, SA may also occur with the association between food and/or exercise plus one or more of the following other cofactors, such as drugs, especially non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory (NSAID), alcohol, infections, temperature variation, and menstrual cycle. SA can explain some cases of idiopathic anaphylaxis, as well as cases of an apparent breakdown in a previously acquired tolerance for food, or finally, when faced with a suggestive clinical history of food allergy or exercise anaphylaxis and the provocation test is negative. In these situations, a more careful clinical history looking for other cofactors is necessary.",

      "abstract": "One of the most frequent motivations for seeking veterinary attention for a cat is when the owner recognises a loss of normal appetite in his pet. The medical term for a lack of appetite for food is ‘anorexia’, and it may be partial or complete. While anorexia is a common manifestation of disease, the mechanisms underlying decreased food intake are complex and not completely understood. The regulation of appetite involves interaction of external stimuli with signals from the gastrointestinal tract and central nervous system. Aberrations in any of the internal control systems for hunger and satiety, or changes in external factors such as diet or feeding environment, can result in partial or total anorexia. The challenge for the practitioner is not only to diagnose and treat the underlying condition, but to recognise at what point inadequate food intake has or will impinge on the patient's nutritional status to the extent that it might deleteriously affect clinical outcome. It is also important to bear in mind the significance that the patient's appetite and food intake has for the cat owner in his overall perception of his pet's condition and quality of life.",

Symptom suppression was maintained at two follow-ups, one at 4-20 months and another at 2.5-3 years.Cue exposure may be effective with BN that is resistant to conventional treatments.

      "abstract": "Although schizophrenia and anorexia nervosa are seemingly very distinct psychiatric disorders, their symptoms are connected by various types of relationships. The present article reviews the literature and recapitulates the views of various authors on the links between these two disorders. Symptoms of anorexia may 1) precede the onset of psychosis; 2) evolve in its active phase or more rarely manifest in remission; and, conversely, 3) psychotic symptoms may occur transiently in the course of anorexia nervosa. When anorexia precedes the manifestation of psychosis, symptoms of anorexia can be treated as a component of the prodromal phase of schizophrenia. Another possibility of co-existence of a psychosis (e.g., schizophrenia) with anorexia is when the eating disorder syndrome manifests at the same time as the full-blown psychotic syndrome. In such cases, when the symptoms of the two disorders occur simultaneously, it is often difficult to say whether the patient is suffering from schizophrenia, in the course of which anorexia has arisen secondary to psychotic symptoms or whether he/she is suffering from anorexia during which he/she has developed psychotic symptoms, usually thematically associated with eating. Studies published so far, mainly case reports, point to the complex nature of the interrelationships between schizophrenia and anorexia nervosa. Further research is needed to conclusively explain the relationships between psychotic disorders and anorexia nervosa, which would allow physicians to use more effective methods of treatment in this group of patients.",

      "title": "“Infantile Colic” as the Sole Manifestation of Gastroesophageal Reflux",
      "abstract": "“Infantile colic” is a colloquial term that is used to designate frequent prolonged bouts of fussing, crying, restlessness, and increased motor activity for no apparent reason, in an otherwise healthy infant (1). Tradition has it that “infantile colic” tends to improve and disappear after 3-4 months of age, but in reality the condition is also noted to persist well into the second half of the 1 st year of life (2). A variety of conditions have been proposed to cause the clinical array that is labeled “infantile colic,” among them intrafamilial problems (3), malabsorption of sugar(s) (4), cow's milk protein allergy (5), neuroendocrine factors (6), depending on the specific viewpoint from which the condition is studied, and the modes of treatment vary accordingly. Bouts of crying, irritability, and restlessness can also be manifested by infants who have pathological gastroesophageal reflux (GER) (7). From accruing experience with lower esophageal pH monitoring, it has emerged that pathological GER can exist without overt evidence of regurgitation, vomiting, or respiratory disturbances (“silent” reflux), while still causing esophagitis (8), and evoking episodes of bitter crying and restlessness that may be construed as reflecting “infantile colic.” In effect, in the course of our experience with esophageal pH monitoring, we detected significant GER in infants whose sole clinical manifestations were episodes of fussing, crying, and restlessness, which had been diagnosed by the primary physician as “infantile colic.” We therefore undertook to perform esophageal pH studies in a prospective series of babies with a presumptive diagnosis of “infantile colic” that was severe and persistent enough to induce referral to our Pediatric Gastroenterology Clinic. PATIENTS AND METHODS Twenty-six consecutive babies, ages 2-9 months, had been labeled as having “infantile colic,” which featured daily prolonged episodes of bitter crying, with irritability, restlessness, and increased motor activity that included drawing up of the legs and stamping movements. The events went on for more than 4 weeks, and had not responded to parental reassurance, dietary manipulations, defoaming agents and herbal teas. There had been no deviation from normal health and development, and no apparent source for the distress. After a detailed history and physical examination, 24-h esophageal pH monitoring was performed with a pH-sensitive electrode placed 4 cm proximal to the lower esophageal sphincter and connected to a Digitrapper MK III recording and digitizing device (Synectics AB, Stockholm, Sweden). The test was performed and interpreted in accordance with the guidelines of the European Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition (9). Informed written consent was obtained from the parents. Infants whose pH-metry indicated significant GER (9), primarily by a finding of esophageal pH < 4 for longer than the upper percentile value for age (9), received oral treatment with cisapride (0.2 mg/kg, q.i.d.) and cimetidine (10 mg/kg, b.i.d.). Cisapride was given throughout the 3 months of follow-up and beyond, whereas cimetidine was discontinued after 4 weeks. The infants with GER were followed up during a period of 3 months, by daily event-reports handed in by the parents every 10 days, and a monthly evaluation of the infants during a visit at the outpatient clinic. RESULTS Of the 26 infants, 14 were male and 12 were female. Their ages ranged between 2 and 9 months (median 4.8 months), and the age at onset of the symptoms was 3 weeks to 4 months (median 1.8 months). The time from onset of symptoms to performance of pH-metry ranged between 5 weeks and 6 months, and had been longer than 2 months in 21 of the infants. Pathological GER was detected by pH-metry in 16 of the 26 infants (61.5%) (Table 1). Treatment with cisapride and cimetidine of these 16 infants, who were referred with a presumptive diagnosis of “infantile colic” but were found to have pathological GER, induced a reduction in the frequency and in the severity of the events within 5 days in 12 of the infants, whereas after 14 days of treatment all the infants with GER were free of any symptom that could be regarded as a manifestation of “infantile colic.” In the remaining 10 infants, those who did not have GER on pH-metry, the picture of “infantile colic” gradually resolved over a period of 4-6 weeks, throughout which family-intervention measures were continued. DISCUSSION The pattern of the clinical constellation that is termed “infantile colic” tends to be fairly stereotypic, in spite of the diversity of conditions that have been proposed as causative agents. A specific cause cannot be discerned in most instances of genuine(?) “infantile colic.” The initial therapeutic measures that the primary physician will undertake are largely influenced by the contention that overproduction of gas by malabsorbed sugars (4) and food allergies (5) are major causes of “infantile colic,” and will most often consist of parental reassurance and dietary manipulation, perhaps with the addition of a defoaming agent such as simethicone, which has been shown to be no more effective than placebo (10). Our study indicates that the differential diagnosis of “infantile colic” should include GER, which can manifest solely as bouts of crying and restlessness, in the absence of any of the other clinical features that are traditionally associated with GER. In our series of 26 infants, who were studied by esophageal pH monitoring while they were having only attacks of crying and restlessness that were labeled “infantile colic,” 16 (61%) were found to have significant GER. The administration of medications that are recommended for the management of GER disease, namely, H2 block-age (cimetidine) and a prokinetic drug (cisapride) (11), induced a dramatic improvement and disappearance of the “colic” features within 5-14 days. GER that causes symptoms is pathological, and requires appropriate therapy that will allay the symptoms, reduce reflux, heal the esophagitis, and prevent long-term complications (11). We are aware that our series consists of selected patients whose seemed to be refractory to the usual therapies, and that our observations are not based on a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. We are also aware that “infantile colic” may resolve spontaneously with time. However, we may regard our group of infants with GER as being their own controls, inasmuch as the rapidity of resolution of their “infantile colic” following initiation of anti-reflux therapy is strongly suggestive of a putative role for GER in evoking the repeated episodes of inconsolable crying and restlessness. We conclude from our observations, that GER can fully mimic the clinical array termed “infantile colic.” Awareness of this association is warranted in view of the damaging potential of pathological GER that is left untreated (8). It might even be justified to propose that severe “infantile colic” be managed by addressing the possibility of GER, whereas other modes of treatment become warranted if no improvement is apparent after 10 days of antireflux medication.",

      "title": "[Disruptive nocturnal behavior in elderly subjects: could it be a parasomnia?].",
      "abstract": "Parasomnias are sleep-related abnormal behaviors. They are frequent and overlooked causes of nocturnal disruptive behavior in the elderly, especially when patients are cognitively impaired. Confusion and violence can result in sleep disruption, injuries for the patients or their bed partners, caregivers distress, and they can be a motive for institutionalization. Parasomnias include the NonREM sleep disorders of arousal (sleepwalking, sleep terrors, confusional arousals and sleep-related eating disorder), the REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) and more rarely the parasomnia overlap syndrome, which associates both NREM and REM parasomnias. Patients with NREM sleep parasomnias are confused, eyes open, with a glazed look during their nocturnal behaviors, and they have a post-episode amnesia. They shout and bolt from the bed (night terrors), look about in a confused manner, walk and speak (sleepwalking), and eat peculiar or inedible food (sleep-related eating disorders). These behaviors, which are frequent in young adults, may be triggered by short-half live hypnotics in elderly. During the parasomnia, the brain is partially awake (enough to perform complex motor and verbal action), and partially asleep (without conscious awareness or responsibility). RBD is characterized by a loss of the normal muscle atonia that accompanies REM sleep. Patients have excessive motor activity such as punching, kicking, or crying out in association with dream content. RBD are frequent in Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies and may precede the cognitive or motor symptoms of these diseases by 5 to 10 years. RBD can also be promoted by antidepressants. When combined with thorough clinical interviews, the video-polysomnography is a powerful tool, especially for discriminating the parasomnia from nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy, sleep apneas and periodic leg movements. Ensuring safety and withdrawing deleterious treatments are useful in patients with violent activities, potential injurious or bothersome to other household members. Clonazepam and melatonin (3-12 mg) are highly effective for treating RBD.",

      "abstract": "Hakekat kehidupan modem yang penuh persaingan merupakan stresor bagi setiap individu. Bila hal tersebut terjadi secara terus menerus akan melampaui ambang batas adaptasi individu sehingga menimbulkan kondisi stres yang merusak atau sering disebut sebagai distress. Banyak kelainan saluran pencernaan, seperti gangguan motilitas usus dan peningkatan kerentanan mukosa terhadap infeksi yang terjadi pada kondisi stres. Telah dilaporkan 567 dari 1000 penderita dengan keluhan nyeri perut di rumah sakit North Carolina,16% diantaranya mengalami gangguan organik (medis), dan 10% mengalami gangguan non organik. (fungsional). Lebih dari 40% penderita dengan gangguan fungsional diberi pengobatan simtomatis yang belum berdasar atas patogenesis yang jelas atau pengobatan yang tidak rasional. Bila hal tersebut dibiarkan berlanjut maka akan timbul berbagai komplikasi dengan mekanisme yang belum jelas. Komplikasi ini akan semakin menyulitkan pengobatan rasional pada kelainan di saluran pencernaan makanan. Di mukosa saluran pencernaan makanan terdapat dua macam ketahanan, yaitu ketahanan alami (innate) dan ketahanan yang didapat (adaptive). Motilitas atau peristaltik usus merupakan ketahanan usus yang alami, mengontrol perlekatan dan kolonisasi bakteri, serta mempercepat pengeluaran imunogen dari lumen usus. Respons imun mukosal merupakan ketahanan usus yang didapat. bertujuan untuk mempertahankan tubuh terhadap patogen dan melakukan toleransi terhadap imunogen dalam makanan dan flora normal. Perubahan motilitas yang disertai dengan perubahan kepekaan usus terhadap patogen pada kondisi stres menunjukkan bahwa terdapat hubungan antara peningkatan motilitas dan modulasi respons imun. Namun sampai saat ini mekanisme perubahan ketahanan mukosal tersebut belum dapat diielaskan. Saat ini telah berkembang ilmu yang mempelajari modulasi fungsi sistem imun pada kondisi stres, yaitu psikoneuroimunologi. Sinyal stres yang dirasakan individu, dirambatkan melalui htipothalamic pituitary-adrenocortical axis (HPA axis). Stresor menvebabkan peningkatan Corticotropin Releasing Factor (CRF) hipotalamus. yang memicu aktivitas aksis HPA. Selain itu CRF dapat ditangkap langsung oleh reseptor CRF-Rl limfosit mukosa, sinyal stres diterima oleh limfosit sehingga perilaku limfosit berubah. Limfosit di mukosa diketahui selain menghasilkan sitokin IFN- IL-10 (Interferon- Interleukin-10) yang berperan pada modulasi respons imun. pada kondisi stres juga menghasilkan peptida SP VIP ( Substance P Vasoactive Intestinal Peptide) yang berperan pada motilitas usus. Secara konseptual perubahan perilaku limfosit tersebut akan memodulasi respons imun (IgA_ lgG IgM). Namun sejauh ini mekanisme modulasi tersebut belum dapat dijelaskan. Jenis penelitian eksperimental, bertujuan untuk menjelaskan mekanisme imunopatobiogenesis respons imun mukosal yang stres. Penelitian menggunakan paradigms psikoneuroimunologi berkonsep sel imunokompeten yang stres, dengan rancangan separate sample pretest-posttest control group dan analisis multivariat. Penelitian menggunakan stresor renjatan listrik (5-30mA) dengan alat Electric Foot Shock , 7 dan 14 hari pada hewan coba, Rattans norvegicus strain Wistar, jantan, berumur 3-4 bulan, berat badan antara 150-175 gram. 60 ekor tikus Wistar yang homogen. dibagi menjadi 6 kelompok secara alokasi random (Random Assignment) berdasar atas bilangan random, yaitu kelompok pretest 7 14, kelompok kontrol 7 14 dan kelompok posttest 7 14. Variabel tergantung adalah kortisol, limfosit penghasil SP, VIP, IFN- , IL-l0, sel plasma penghasil IgA, IgG dan IgM. Hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa pada respons imun mukosal yang stres akibat stresor renjatan listrik selama 7 hari terjadi peningkatan jumlah limfosit penghasil SP, VIP, IFN- , IL-10, jumlah sel plasma penghasil IgA, IgG, kadar kortisol darah dan penurunan jumlah sel plasma penghasil IgM. Pada respons imun yang stres akibat stresor renjatan listrik selama 14 hari terjadi penurunan limfosit penghasil SP, VIP, IFN- IL-10, sel plasma penghasil IgA; IgG, IgM dan peningkatan kadar kortisol darah (namun mulai menurun). Berdasar pola diskriminan dan kerangka konsep penelitian maka modulasi respons imun mukosal yang stres akibat renjatan listrik 7 hari meningkatkan fungsi CRF, sinyal tersebut dirambatkan, baik secara langsung ke limfosit mukosal maupun melalui aksis HPA. Sinyal yang dirambatkan melalui jalur CRF–CRF¬Rlmeningkatkan produksi SP dan VIP oleh limfosit mukosal. Peningkatan fungsi SP dan VIP, selain meningkatkan fungsi IFN-y dan pembentukan imunoglobulin (IgA dan IgG), juga potensial meningkatkan motilitas usus. Modulasi respons imun mukosal yang stres akibat stresor renjatan listrik selama 14 hari, masih terjadi peningkatan CRF, sinyal tersebut terutama dirambatkan secara langsung melalui CRF–CRF-RI, dan didapatkan penurunan fungsi SP dan VIP serta peningkatan fungsi IFN- dan IL-10 dengan besar yang tidak lama. Penurunan fungsi VIP yang jauh lebih besar daripada penurunan fungsi SP menyebabkan dominasi fungsi SP, sehingga peningkatan fungsi IFN- , IL-10 dan dominasi SP masih cukup kuat untuk mempertahankan fungsi IgA. Namun demikian penurunan SP dan VIP tersebut berpotensi untuk menurunkan motilitas usus. Dapat disimpulkan, pada stres akibat stresor renjatan listrik 7 had, kedua ketahanan mukosal bersinergi melakukan upaya ketahanan mukosal, sedangkan pada stres akibat stresor renjatan listrik 14 hari terjadi kelelahan motilitas usus lebih awal daripada respons imun.",

      "title": "Menstrual Disorders Related to Eating Disorders",
      "abstract": "Eating Disorders (ED) are associated with multiple physical complications that strongly affect the physical health of these young and fragile patients and can also cause significant mortality, the highest among psychiatric pathologies. Among the various organic complications, albeit still little known, the gynecological implications, up to infertility, are very widespread. Both among adolescent and adult patients, gynecological symptoms can be very widespread and range from menstrual irregularities to amenorrhea, from vaginitis to ovarian polycystosis, up to complications during the gestational phase and in postpartum, in addition to the possible consequences on the unborn child. Among the most frequent and significant gynecological disorders in women with ED, there are menstrual irregularities that may occur with oligomenorrhea or even amenorrhea. This symptom, although no longer part of the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for defining Anorexia Nervosa (AN), must be considered a very relevant event in the overall evaluation of young women and adolescents with eating disorders. Functional Hypothalamic Amenorrhea in ED patients is related to psychological distress, excessive exercise, disordered eating, or a combination of these factors which results in suppression of the hypothalamic- pituitary-ovarian axis, resulting in hypoestrogenism. The objective of this paper is to summarize the causes and the mechanism underlying the menstrual disorders and to provide a better understanding of the correlation between the reproductive system and the mechanisms that regulate food intake and eating habits. In addition, early recognition of risk factors for eating disorders for gynecological implications can help put more accurate assessments of patients to prevent potentially fatal complications. The importance of the involvement of specialist gynecologists in the multidisciplinary team that has to follow patients with eating disorders is also discussed.",

Contemporary methods used to reinstate normal eating such as persuasion, coaxing, spoon-feeding, insulin injections, tube-feeding, and others, can result in the patient being shaped or conditioned to eat only with assistance. Based on an experimental investigation of erratic eating in mental patients, the authors present a behavioural model for the identification and treatment of chronic refusal to eat. The syndrome of chronic anorexia is regarded largely as the acquired, learned, behaviour of rejecting food. When food rejection is not followed by social reinforcement it disappears in a relatively short period of time, and normal eating is reinstated.",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics ASXL3-related disorder is characterized by developmental delay or intellectual disability, typically in the moderate to severe range, with speech and language delay and/or absent speech. Affected individuals may also display autistic features. There may be issues with feeding. While dysmorphic facial features have been described, they are typically nonspecific. Affected individuals may also have hypotonia that can transition to spasticity resulting in unusual posture with flexion contractions of the elbows, wrists, and fingers. Other findings may include poor postnatal growth, strabismus, seizures, sleep disturbance, and dental anomalies. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of ASXL3-related disorder is established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in ASXL3 by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Feeding therapy; gastrostomy tube placement for those with persistent feeding issues; anti-reflux medication and/or fundoplication for those with gastroesophageal disease; standard treatment for epilepsy, joint contractures, sleep apnea, dental anomalies, strabismus and/or refractive error, and developmental delay / intellectual disability. Surveillance: At each visit: Measurement of growth parameters and nutritional status; assessment of developmental progress, behavioral issues, new neurologic manifestations (change in tone, seizure onset and/or frequency), mobility and self-help skills, as well as signs and symptoms of sleep disturbance. Dental evaluation every six months after age three years or as clinically indicated. At least annual ophthalmology evaluation. Genetic counseling ASXL3-related disorder is an autosomal dominant disorder typically caused by a de novo pathogenic variant. Rarely, individuals diagnosed with ASXL3-related disorder have the disorder as the result of a pathogenic variant inherited from a parent. If the ASXL3 pathogenic variant identified in the proband is not identified in either parent, the risk to sibs is presumed to be low but greater than that of the general population because of the possibility of parental germline mosaicism. Once the ASXL3 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

Severe illness in the newborn, regardless of the underlying cause, tends to manifest itself in a rather stereotypic way with relatively nonspecific findings, such as poor feeding, drowsiness, lethargy, hypotonia, and failure to thrive. Because inherited metabolic diseases are individually rare, clinicians have a tendency to pursue the possibility only after other more common conditions, such as sepsis, have been excluded. Further delay often occurs because the type of investigation required to make the diagnosis of inherited metabolic disease includes unfamiliar tests, which the clinician may feel uncomfortable interpreting owing to a general lack of confidence regarding metabolic problems.",

      "title": "Bloating in functional bowel disorders",
      "abstract": "Summary Bloating is a frequently reported symptom in functional bowel disorders. It usually occurs in combination with other symptoms, but may also occur in isolation. The severity of bloating tends to worsen during the course of the day and improves overnight. Although frequently considered to be a subjective phenomenon, recent studies have shown that bloating is associated with a measurable increase in abdominal girth. The pathophysiology of bloating remains elusive, but the evidence supports a sensorimotor dysfunction of the bowel. The possible mechanisms include abnormal gas trapping, fluid retention, food intolerance and altered gut microbial flora. Further studies are needed to define the sensorimotor abnormalities associated with bloating, which might be segmental and transient rather than generalized and persistent. The lack of understanding of this symptom is paralleled by a limited availability of therapeutic options. Conventional medications used in functional bowel disorders are not helpful and may indeed worsen the symptoms. In future, new drugs with activity against serotonin and kappa receptors, or novel approaches such as the use of exclusion diets, probiotics and hypnotherapy, may prove to be useful.",

In Autism Spectrum Disorder the word Autism means- a developmental disorder that is characterized by difficulty in social interaction and communication. It is derived from Greek word ‘auto’ which means ‘self’. Spectrum means- which is not limited to specific conditions and Disorder means- a state of confusion/mess. Characteristics related to ASD can include can’t able to make eye contact with others, does not respond to name and can’t able to show facial expressions like happy, sad, angry, and surprised by 9 months of age, showing no gestures by 12 months of age, does not show interest to play with other children by 36 months of age. Some other characteristics include-delaying language skills, delaying learning skills, unusual eating and sleeping habits, gastrointestinal issues (for example, constipation), unusual mood or emotional reactions, anxiety, stress, lack of fear or more fear than expected [1].",

      "abstract": "Functional gastrointestinal disorders are collections of symptoms attributable to the gastrointestinal tract in the absence of mucosal, structural, or biochemical disease. The two most common disorders, irritable bowel syndrome and functional dyspepsia, have common etiopathogenetic features, notably psychosocial disturbances, dysmotility, heightened sensitivity, and, possibly, an association with a postinfective state. The third condition is constipation, in which transit disorders and abnormal evacuation represent disturbances of function that are amenable to therapy. This review is an update of the control mechanisms, pathophysiology, investigation, and potential pharmacotherapies of these disorders. Serotonergic and adrenergic agents and neurotrophic factors are among the novel approaches that may have a significant impact on these disorders.",

      "title": "Aplicación del programa de intervención \"talleres de cuidado colaborativo\" en familiares de personas con un trastorno alimentario",
      "abstract": "Los trastornos alimentarios y de la ingesta de alimentos (TA en adelante), entre los que se encuentran la anorexia nerviosa, la bulimia nerviosa y el trastorno por atracon, constituyen un conjunto de cuadros clinicos que se caracterizan por la alteracion de las conductas relacionadas con la alimentacion (restriccion alimentaria, episodios de sobreingesta, atracones, etc.) y por la presencia de metodos de control del peso (vomitos, ejercicio fisico excesivo, laxantes, etc.). Son trastornos psicologicos de etiologia multifactorial y repercusiones serias para quienes los padecen, en todas las areas de su vida (Frank, 2015). No obstante, los aspectos positivos que perciben de los sintomas, como la sensacion de control, autoeficacia, proteccion o seguridad, entre otros, favorecen que presenten ambivalencia frente al cambio y el tratamiento o recuperacion. Cuando el TA se manifiesta, las consecuencias fisicas, psicologicas y sociales que experimentan las personas que lo padecen les llevan a necesitar la asistencia de sus familiares, que asumen el rol de cuidadores, para asi obtener apoyo emocional, instrumental y economico (Dimitropoulos, Klopfer, Lazar y Schacter, 2009). Por tanto, estos problemas de salud implican repercusiones no solo para ellos, sino tambien para sus seres queridos, es decir, para los padres, hermanos, parejas, abuelos y amigos cercanos, entre otros. En esta linea, las consecuencias para los cuidadores de personas con un TA, fruto de su rol, tienden a ser mas negativas que para otros familiares, como los de afectados de esquizofrenia o de depresion, debido a que experimentan una mayor tension en la relacion con quien padece el problema, sienten una preocupacion mas elevada por su salud y su futuro, e indican tener que supervisarle o instarle a afrontar las actividades cotidianas en mayor medida (Martin et al., 2015). En general, las repercusiones psicologicas y emocionales para los seres queridos de quien sufre el TA son graves. Por ejemplo, tienden a percibir una menor sensacion de autoeficacia, y un incremento en la sintomatologia depresiva y ansiosa (Anastasiadou, Sepulveda, Parks, Cuellar-Flores y Graell, 2016; Sim et al., 2009). Por otra parte, el desconocimiento sobre estos problemas de salud contribuye a la aparicion de respuestas emocionales y conductuales desadaptativas (Whitney et al., 2005), que pueden girar en torno al criticismo u hostilidad, o constituir respuestas de ansiedad e hiperproteccion. Estas reacciones, denominadas „emocion expresada‟, pueden influir tambien en los resultados en salud y recuperacion de los propios pacientes. Se genera asi, como resultado, un determinado clima emocional en la familia que puede ser perjudicial para todos sus miembros. Por tanto, se hacen necesarias las intervenciones especificas sobre los cuidadores de personas con TA, con el objetivo de disminuir su malestar emocional y evitar que actuen, en contra de su intencion, como factor mantenedor del problema. Ademas, cabe destacar que el impacto de estos problemas en la salud de los familiares es tan elevado que precisan de una intervencion mas focalizada en ellos para que su malestar disminuya (Slater, Treasure, Schmidt, Gilchrist y Wade, 2015). Uno de los abordajes que existen en la actualidad, centrado especificamente en los cuidadores, es el Maudsley Collaborative Care Skills Workshops (talleres de cuidado colaborativo), desarrollado desde la unidad especializada en TA del South London and Maudsley Hospital, en Reino Unido. Esta intervencion ha demostrado su eficacia en dar respuesta a las necesidades de informacion y de adquisicion de habilidades para manejar el problema que presentan los familiares, ademas de disminuir su malestar psicologico y la carga de cuidado subjetiva que experimentan (Treasure et al., 2007). El objetivo de este programa de intervencion consiste en que los familiares aprendan habilidades de comunicacion y de gestion de las situaciones relacionadas con el TA, para convertirse en cuidadores que guien a sus seres queridos con el problema y les ayuden durante el proceso de enfermedad, relacionandose con ellos de una forma mas positiva (Treasure, Sepulveda, Whitaker, Todd y Lopez, 2010). Hasta el momento, las intervenciones llevadas a cabo desde este marco de referencia ofrecen resultados positivos. Tras el trabajo realizado con los cuidadores, se confirma la reduccion en el malestar psicologico, en la carga de cuidado y en la emocion expresada, manteniendose estos resultados a lo largo de los posteriores seguimientos (Hibbs, Rhind, Leppanen y Treasure, 2015; Pepin y King, 2013; Sepulveda et al., 2010; Treasure y Nazar, 2016; Treasure et al., 2007). Ademas, el feedback directo de los propios cuidadores respalda estos datos, puesto que manifiestan estar satisfechos con los contenidos de los talleres, el incremento del conocimiento sobre su rol como cuidadores, la mejora de la comunicacion en la familia y el poder formar parte de un ambiente de normalizacion del problema, el cual resulta de ayuda para ellos (Goodier et al., 2014; Sepulveda, Lopez, Macdonald y Treasure, 2008; Sepulveda, Lopez, Todd, Whitaker y Treasure, 2008). No obstante, los talleres de cuidado colaborativo para los familiares se han realizado en escasas zonas geograficas, fundamentalmente en Reino Unido, lugar en que se desarrollaron. Pepin y King (2013) senalan la necesidad de aplicar este tipo de talleres en otras localizaciones, para comparar los resultados y averiguar si tienen un impacto similar, observando si existen diferencias culturales. Ademas, cabe senalar que los cuidadores de personas con un TA suelen presentar motivacion para participar en estos programas (Whitaker y Macdonald, 2008), pudiendo resultar un recurso adecuado para ellos, con el objetivo de incrementar su bienestar y sus recursos para hacer frente a las circunstancias adversas. Es por ello que el objetivo de este trabajo ha sido, por un lado, analizar y describir la representacion de la enfermedad, la emocion expresada, el impacto de los sintomas y el malestar psicologico de los familiares de afectados de TA y, por otro, evaluar la eficacia de los talleres de cuidado colaborativo en cuidadores espanoles, en comparacion con otro programa de intervencion creado ad-hoc, al que se denomino psicoeducativo.",

      "abstract": "La discapacidad intelectual (DI) o trastorno del desarrollo intelectual (TDI) es uno de los principales trastornos del neurodesarrollo y afecta al 2% de la poblacion, es decir, a mas de un millon de personas en Francia. Se caracteriza por una capacidad reducida para razonar y comprender informacion abstracta o compleja, que tiene un fuerte impacto en el aprendizaje escolar y limita la capacidad de adaptacion en la vida diaria, incluso en la edad adulta. La discapacidad intelectual, o discapacidad mental, es el resultado de una interaccion de la vulnerabilidad individual de una persona que tiene DI con su ecosistema, es decir, el entorno familiar, cultural o institucional que puede ser un obstaculo o un facilitador. La deteccion de un nino con una trayectoria de desarrollo inusual requiere un buen conocimiento del desarrollo psicomotor por parte de los profesionales. La DI puede estar aislada, pero tambien es muy frecuente que aparezca asociada a otros trastornos del neurodesarrollo, como autismo, trastornos motores o sensoriales (audicion, vision), trastornos graves del sueno, de la alimentacion, o patologias medicas como la epilepsia, o una amplia variedad de trastornos psicopatologicos como ansiedad, depresion y trastornos de la regulacion emocional. Las causas de la DI son multiples, y mas de una de cada dos veces son de origen genetico, existiendo varios centenares de enfermedades raras que pueden estar detras de su origen, pero es frecuente aun que sus causas sean desconocidas. La difusion de las nuevas tecnicas geneticas (secuenciacion de alto rendimiento) deberia reducir el numero de personas sin diagnosticar y devolver su lugar a un enfoque diagnostico razonado basado en la clinica. La evaluacion periodica y multidimensional de las competencias cognitivas, escolares, socioemocionales y adaptativas a lo largo de la vida permite comprender mejor el funcionamiento de las personas con una DI y prever estrategias adecuadas de aprendizaje, tratamiento, acompanamiento y apoyo para una mejor calidad de vida y participacion en la vida de la sociedad.",

      "title": "Gambling Disorder",
      "abstract": "Gambling disorder is characterized by a persistent and recurrent maladaptive pattern of gambling behavior, preoccupation with gambling activities, loss of control, and continued gambling despite problems in social or occupational functioning (Box 62- ). It is associated with significant financial losses, legal problems, and disrupted interpersonal and familial relationships. Individuals with gambling disorder are also at increased risk for suicide attempts (Phillips et al. 1997), new-onset comorbid psychiatric disorders (Kessler et al. 2008), and several medical conditions (Morasco et al. 2006). DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Gambling Disorder 312.31 F63.0 Persistent and recurrent problematic gambling behavior leading to clinically significant impairment or distress, as indicated by the individual exhibiting four (or more) of the following in a 12-month period: Needs to gamble with increasing amounts of money in order to achieve the desired excitement. Is restless or irritable when attempting to cut down or stop gambling. Has made repeated unsuccessful efforts to control, cut back, or stop gambling. Is often preoccupied with gambling (e.g., having persistent thoughts of reliving past gambling experiences, handicapping or planning the next venture, thinking of ways to get money with which to gamble). Often gambles when feeling distressed (e.g., helpless, guilty, anxious, depressed). After losing money gambling, often returns another day to get even (\"chasing\" one's losses). Lies to conceal the extent of involvement with gambling. Has jeopardized or lost a significant relationship, job, or educational or career opportunity because of gambling. Relies on others to provide money to relieve desperate financial situations caused by gambling. The gambling behavior is not better explained by a manic episode . Specify if: Episodic: Meeting diagnostic criteria at more than one time point, with symptoms subsiding between periods of gambling disorder for at least several months. Persistent: Experiencing continuous symptoms, to meet diagnostic criteria for multiple years. Specify if: In early remission: After full criteria for gambling disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for gambling disorder have been met for at least 3 months but for less than 12 months. In sustained remission: After full criteria for gambling disorder were previously met, none of the criteria for gambling disorder have been met during a period of 12 months or longer. Specify current severity: Mild: 4–5 criteria met. Moderate: 6–7 criteria met. Severe: 8–9 criteria met. Despite its serious consequences (Kessler et al. 2008; Petry et al. 2005), gambling disorder is rarely diagnosed and even more rarely treated (Slutske 2006). Less than 10% of individuals with gambling disorder ever seek treatment (Slutske 2006), probably because of a combination of ambivalence about seeking treatment on the part of the patients and limited access for those who wish to seek it. Although some data suggest that many individuals with gambling disorder recover without formal treatment (Hodgins and el-Guebaly 2000; Slutske et al. 2003), there is no available information on the time to remission in natural recovery or the risk of recurrence. Fortunately, despite our limited knowledge about the epidemiology and etiology of gambling disorders, a growing body of literature has examined pharmacological and psychological treatments for gambling disorder.",

      "abstract": "Constipation is a common disturbance of the digestive system where the difficulty during defecation or the sensation of incomplete bowel evacuation. Bowel frequency is influenced by several factors including intake of dietary fiber, emotional make up, and psychological morbidity. Introspective individuals have a lower bowel frequency and produce less stool than extroverts. Infrequent bowel actions in the absence of symptoms can be regarded as part of the normal spectrum of bowel frequency. Low bowel frequency is more common in women.Constipation is a common problem of elderly people of age 60 plus where use of laxative is frequent.Constipation is supposed to be the main cause of all diseases. Therefore, it should be treated thoroughly. Several other diseases and disorders also crop up if the bowel is constipated. Constipation can cure easy by practicing some Yogasana (postures) Bhujanghasana , Trikonasana (triangular stretch pose), Ardha Matsyendrasana (Half spinal twist), Supta Vajrasana (the sleeping pelvic pose), Dhanurasana (Bow pose), Sarvangasana (Shoulder stand) and Kapalabhati (frontal brain bellowing), Pranayama . The most important cause of constipation is diet with low dietary fiber and heavy fat. Diet which contains high fiber leads to overcome constipation more powerfully.Â",

      "abstract": "Back pain in the working age population can coincide with work-related activities and may lead to temporary or permanent work disability in the case of functional impairment that interacts with workplace demands. This can lead to economic if not existential problems for the affected individual. Although neurogenic or inflammatory back pain may be the cause, the big majority of all cases is caused by \"common\" low back pain with or without irradiating pain, the main problem being frequent recurrencies of acute pain episodes (periodic or relapsing course). After early exclusion of specific causes (i. e. \"red flags\": usually identified through history and simple laboratory findings!) repetitive examinations should be avoided. Structural changes and physical job demands should not be overestimated as causal factors. In the early phase of a work disability more emphasis should be laid however on appropriate information and medication and, in case of persistent impairment, active treatment (after 3 weeks or relapse). Longtime workplace absence has important individual and socioeconomic consequences. The risk for chronification can be estimated through evaluation of \"yellow flags\" and observation of characteristics of the course in the individual case. An early return to work and to activities of daily life is urgent. In cases at risk for chronification and/or with obstacles to reintegration at work an interdisciplinary work-oriented rehabilitation or social and occupational reintegration should be organised.Rückenschmerzen im Erwerbstätigenalter zeichnen sich dadurch aus, dass sie einerseits im Zusammenhang mit Arbeitstätigkeiten auftreten können, andererseits im Falle der Beeinträchtigung von Körperfunktionen mit den Arbeitsaufgaben interagieren können und so zur vorübergehenden oder andauernden Beeinträchtigung der Arbeitsfähigkeit führen können. Dies kann ökonomische, unter Umständen auch existentielle Probleme zur Folge haben. Obwohl auch neurogene und entzündliche Ursachen in Frage kommen, stellen die „banalen“ Rückenschmerzen mit und ohne Ausstrahlung die überwiegende Mehrzahl der Fälle dar. Ein Hauptproblem stellt sich aufgrund der hohen Rezidivneigung („periodischer Verlauf“). Nach frühzeitigem Ausschluss spezifischer Ursachen („rote Flaggen“: Anamnese und einfaches Labor meist ausreichend!) sind wiederholte Abklärung zu vermeiden. Strukturelle Veränderungen und physische Arbeitsbelastungen als Ursachen dürfen nicht überbewertet werden. Dagegen spielt in der Frühphase eine geeignete Information und Medikation, bei anhaltender Funktionsstörung eine aktive Behandlung (Verläufe über 3 Wochen oder Rezidive) im Vordergrund. Langzeitverläufe haben erhebliche individuelle und sozioökonomische Konsequenzen. Das Chronifizierungsrisiko kann mittels „gelber Flaggen“ und Verlaufscharakteristika erkannt werden. Eine möglichst rasche Rückkehr zu Alltagsaktivitäten ist vordringlich. Bei Risiko für chronische Verläufe und/oder Eingliederungsproblemen sind eine interdisziplinäre arbeitsbezogene Rehabilitation oder sozialberufliche Eingliederung zu forcieren.",

      "abstract": "The term \"functional dyspepsia\" describes a complex of symptoms which are related to the upper gastrointestinal tract and frequently experienced by the patients after food intake. The pathophysiology of functional dyspepsia is still poorly understood. There are no organic causes found nor are there any functional changes observed that correlate with symptom occurrence and intensity and which could offer a satisfactory explanation for the symptoms and a basis for successful therapy. Mechanisms discussed include a disturbance of gastric motility and emptying, an increased sensitivity of the stomach to or hypersecretion of gastric acid, and infection by Helicobacter pylori. Recent research indicates visceral hypersensitivity of the gastroduodenal region to mechanical (distension) and chemical (nutrients or neuromodulators) stimulation to be a major factor in the aetiology of functional dyspepsia, potentially offering an explanation why dyspeptic symptoms are often related to food intake. The occurrence of dyspeptic symptoms in relation to food ingestion frequently prompts the gastroenterologist to the diagnosis of a motility disorder and subsequent therapy with prokinetic drugs. These substances may result in an improvement of gastric emptying, but not necessarily symptoms. It is apparent that the incompletely understood pathophysiology of functional dyspepsia is one of the main reasons for the lack of an effective therapy for this common condition.",

      "abstract": "Nausea is an uneasy feeling in the stomach while vomiting refers to the forceful expulsion of gastric contents. Chronic nausea and vomiting represent a diverse array of disorders defined by 4 weeks or more of symptoms. Chronic nausea and vomiting result from a variety of pathophysiological processes, involving gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal causes. The prevalence of chronic nausea and vomiting is unclear, although the epidemiology of specific conditions, such as gastroparesis and cyclic vomiting syndrome, is better understood. The economic impact of chronic nausea and vomiting and effects on quality of life are substantial. The initial diagnostic evaluation involves distinguishing gastrointestinal causes of chronic nausea and vomiting (e.g., gastroparesis, cyclic vomiting syndrome) from nongastrointestinal causes (e.g., medications, vestibular, and neurologic disorders). After excluding anatomic, mechanical and biochemical causes of chronic nausea and vomiting, gastrointestinal causes can be grouped into two broad categories based on the finding of delayed, or normal, gastric emptying. Non-gastrointestinal disorders can also cause chronic nausea and vomiting. As a validated treatment algorithm for chronic nausea and vomiting does not exist, treatment should be based on a thoughtful discussion of benefits, side effects, and costs. The objective of this monograph is to review the evaluation and treatment of patients with chronic nausea and vomiting, emphasizing common gastrointestinal causes.",

The classic picture is that of the Kleine-Levin syndrome in which sleep episodes are associated with other symptoms, eating or sexual disorders and psychological disturbance. The origin is still unknown. In addition to the Kleine-Levin syndrome, recurrent hypersomnias symptomatic of organic or psychiatric disorders may be encountered.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a highly prevalent disorder of affect characterized by persistent sadness or anhedonia (an inability to experience pleasure), typically accompanied by additional symptoms such as negative cognitions (self-perceptions of failure, feelings of guilt, and/or suicidal thoughts), somatic dysfunction (fatigue, loss of appetite, fatigue, disturbances in sleep), and impairment in daily functioning (e.g., indecisiveness) (Gelfand & Teti, 1990).When such a symptom pattern persists for at least two consecutive weeks and is not accompanied by period manic swings, the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM-IV-TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000) identifies it as a major depressive episode (MDD).A formal DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of MDD can be given for a single major depressive episode, or for multiple, recurring episodes over time, which is common.Other depressive disorders identified in DSM-IV-TR include dysthymic disorder, and adjustment disorder with depressed mood.Depression is more likely to occur under adverse circumstances, such as poverty, single parenthood (Gallagher, Hobfoll, Ritter, Lavin, 1997;Grant, Jack, Fitzpatrick, & Ernst, 2011), and chronic illness (Davidson, Echeverry, Katon, Lin, & Von Korff, 2011), and it may also be co-morbid with other psychiatric disorders.It is common to find, for example, that depression co-occurs with anxiety (Balta, & Paparrigopoulos, 2010) and that chronic depression is a salient feature of some personality disorders (Brieger, Ehrt, Bloeink, & Marneros, 2002).Because of the ubiquity of depressed mood as a feature of psychiatric, medical, and psychosocial conditions, researchers frequently focus on the severity and chronicity of depressive symptoms as a predictor of behavior in different contexts, using well-established, validated questionnaires that tap directly into participants' level of sadness, anhedonia, negative dysfunctional cognitions, somatic complaints, and impairments in daily living.Such measures include the Beck Depression Inventory (Beck, Steer, & Garbin, 1988), the Center for Epidemiological Studies -Depression scale (Radloff, 1977), and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (Hamilton, 1960).These assessments tap the frequency and severity of depressive symptoms and provide overall scores and cut points that, when exceeded, identify individuals with clinical levels of symptom severity.www.intechopen.",

Eating disorders comprise anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN) and associated eating disorders. Nutritional intervention in the treatment of eating disorders is an essential component and therefore the dietitian is an essential member of the multidisciplinary team, drawing on specialist skills in areas of nutrition, physiology and behaviour change. Paediatricians and general practitioners often refer young people with a history of weight loss to the dietitian. It is therefore not unusual for dietitians to be the first health professionals to identify or question a possible eating disorder. Dietitians working in eating disorders must have an understanding of the underlying dynamics and be aware of their professional boundaries when treating these complex patients. Weighing in the same way and at the same time of day will help to minimise fluctuations in weight from non-nutritional reasons.",

      "title": "Mitochondrial Neurogastrointestinal Encephalopathy Disease",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalopathy (MNGIE) disease is characterized by progressive gastrointestinal dysmotility (manifesting as early satiety, nausea, dysphagia, gastroesophageal reflux, postprandial emesis, episodic abdominal pain and/or distention, and diarrhea); cachexia; ptosis/ophthalmoplegia or ophthalmoparesis; leukoencephalopathy; and demyelinating peripheral neuropathy (manifesting as paresthesias (tingling, numbness, and pain) and symmetric and distal weakness more prominently affecting the lower extremities). The order in which manifestations appear is unpredictable. Onset is usually between the first and fifth decades; in about 60% of individuals, symptoms begin before age 20 years. Diagnosis/testing The clinical diagnosis of MNGIE disease is based on the presence of severe gastrointestinal dysmotility, cachexia, ptosis, external ophthalmoplegia, sensorimotor neuropathy, asymptomatic leukoencephalopathy as observed on brain MRI, and family history consistent with autosomal recessive inheritance. The diagnosis of MNGIE disease can be established in a proband by detection of one of the following: (1) biallelic pathogenic variants in TYMP (formerly known as ECGF1); (2) markedly reduced levels of thymidine phosphorylase enzyme activity; or (3) elevated plasma concentrations of thymidine and deoxyuridine. Management Treatment of manifestations: Management is primarily supportive and includes attention to swallowing difficulties and airway protection; dromperidone for nausea and vomiting; gastrostomy, and parenteral feeding for nutritional support; antibiotics for intestinal bacterial overgrowth; amitriptyline, nortriptyline, and gabapentin for neuropathic symptoms; specialized schooling arrangements; and physical and occupational therapy. Prevention of secondary complications: Attention to swallowing abnormalities and diverticulosis, respectively, may help prevent aspiration pneumonia and ruptured diverticula. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Drugs that interfere with mitochondrial function should be avoided; medications primarily metabolized in the liver should be used with caution. Genetic counseling MNGIE disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. The parents of an affected individual are obligate heterozygotes and therefore carry one mutated allele; heterozygotes are asymptomatic. Unless an individual with MNGIE disease has offspring with either an affected individual or a carrier, his/her offspring will be obligate heterozygotes for a pathogenic variant in TYMP. Carrier testing for at-risk family members and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible once the TYMP pathogenic variants in the family are known.",

Features of gastrointestinal dysfunction include disordered control of saliva, dysphagia, gastroparesis, constipation in the sense of decreased bowel movement frequency, and defecatory dysfunction necessitating increased straining and resulting in incomplete evacuation. Excess saliva accumulates in the mouth because of decreased swallowing frequency. Dysphagia develops in approximately 50% of patients and may be a reflection of both central nervous system and enteric nervous system derangement. Gastroparesis may produce a variety of symptoms, including nausea, and also may be responsible for some of the motor fluctuations seen with levodopa therapy. Bowel dysfunction in PD may be the result of both delayed colon transit and impaired anorectal muscle coordination.",

The cardinal symptom of ALS, weakness, may compromise nutrition in a number of ways and multiple factors may be present in the same individual. Usually, long before the actual diagnosis of ALS, a patient may be noticing some unintentional weight loss, a decrease in appetite, slight tripping, periods of restlessness, and/or slurred speech. More often than not, these individual complaints can be easily dismissed by a patient who attributes these problems to recent colds, changes in eating habits and/or exercise, changes in the weather, or allergies, just to name a few. However when these problems do not go away, but actually continue to worsen, some patients realize their probable diagnosis. They may remain in denial of this now overt symptom progression.",

Parasomnias can be categorized either as primary or secondary. Transitional parasomnias typically occur during wake-to-sleep transitions and can persist into N1 (Stage 1) sleep. Primary parasomnias can be subdivided by the sleep from which they appear, e.g., rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, non-REM (NREM) sleep, or both. Secondary parasomnias are more commonly associated with other organ system dysfunction and manifest symptoms during the sleep period.",

Hunger leads to initiation of eating. Eating activates inhibitory signals producing satiety. Satiety is the quality or state of being fed or gratified to or beyond capacity mediated in the short term by mechanical factors related to swallowing and gastric distention, chemical factors related to taste and smell, and psychological factors (sensory-specific satiety) and in the long term by chemoreception of nutrients and gastrointestinal (GI) peptides and neuroendocrine and neuronal factors and is a major motivation for terminating eating (1).",

Insomnia may be either an acute or a chronic problem. Acute insomnia, usually defined as poor sleep associated with a specific life event, such as an important examination, resolves when the event passes or within a period of 3 weeks. Chronic insomnia may begin after an acute episode, if conditioning factors are involved, but typically presents as a long-standing complaint despite varied attempts at treatment.",

He underwent elective spinal cord detethering via the safe and effective, minimally invasive technique described in the video.The patient's parents gave informed consent for treatment and video recording. Institutional review board approval was deemed unnecessary.Given the variety of surgical techniques used for cord detethering, this video may assist other surgeons in developing techniques that require little to no compromise of the developing bony spinal column while achieving sufficient release of the spinal cord.[4].",

      "abstract": "SUMMARY Bloating is a frequently reported symptom in functional bowel disorders. It usually occurs in combination with other symptoms, but may also occur in isolation. The severity of bloating tends to worsen during the course of the day and improves overnight. Although frequently considered to be a subjective phenomenon, recent studies have shown that bloating is associated with a measurable increase in abdominal girth. The pathophysiology of bloating remains elusive, but the evidence supports a sensorimotor dysfunction of the bowel. The possible mechanisms include abnormal gas trapping, fluid retention, food intolerance and altered gut microbial flora. Further studies are needed to define the sensorimotor abnormalities associated with bloating, which might be segmental and transient rather than generalized and persistent. The lack of understanding of this symptom is paralleled by a limited availability of therapeutic options. Conventional medications used in functional bowel disorders are not helpful and may indeed worsen the symptoms. In future, new drugs with activity against serotonin and kappa receptors, or novel approaches such as the use of exclusion diets, probiotics and hypnotherapy, may prove to be useful.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Bulimia nervosa (BN) is an eating disorder that consists of recurrent binging episodes and inappropriate compensatory behaviors. Binge eating is defined as eating a large amount of food within a discrete time period accompanied by a sense of lack of control over eating during the episode. Examples of inappropriate compensatory behaviors include self-induced vomiting, fasting, excessive exercise, and laxative or diuretic misuse. Additionally, patients with BN experience body image disturbance, where their self-evaluation is unduly affected by weight and body shape concerns. Bulimia nervosa typically begins in late adolescence or young adulthood. Patients either are typically of normal weight or are overweight. Physical examination and laboratory findings are typically normal; however, medical complications can include electrolyte disturbances, cardiac arrhythmia, and dental caries. Fluoxetine and other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are commonly used to treat BN. A nutritional consultation is another important component of care. Finally, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and family therapy are the psychotherapies of choice.",

They have difficulty falling asleep and/or staying asleep and believe they will not be able to fall asleep unless they eat. Individuals with NES frequently experience significant mental distress and a worsening of mood in the evening. NES generally begins in early adulthood, although it may start during the teenage years. It is a long-standing problem for individuals. Symptoms may worsen with stressful life circumstances. Prognosis is dependent on accurately diagnosing the NES along with any coexisting disorders. The relationship between sleep disorders and eating behaviors is of considerable scientific interest and an area of active investigation and evolving conceptualization. Patients with NES eat most of their calories after the evening meal. They eat “in order to sleep”, and each eating episode is generally shorter and involves fewer calories.",

      "title": "Adolescent Bulimia Nervosa—Part 2: A Proposed Group Nursing Intervention",
      "abstract": "Bulimia nervosa (BN) is the most common eating disorder noted in the female adolescent and college-age population. BN develops like other self-destructive substance addictions and often runs a chronic and relapsing course. The potentially irrevocable effects, including death, of BN on the growth and development of adolescents emphasize the importance of providing appropriate nursing interventions for this population. This proposed nursing plan of care for female adolescent suffering with BN is guided by Roy's Adaptation Model and incorporates aspects of addiction, nutritional, cognitive-behavioral, relapse prevention, and family therapy techniques and models. This group plan was developed to provide a framework or foundation for nurses working with this population. Future practice and research recommendations are also presented. Bulimia nervosa (BN) develops like other self-destructive substance addictions. The bulimic behavior may begin with a specialized trigger (dieting-binging-purging), but the trigger tends to broaden gradually to encompass other emotional or social stimuli (e.g., feeling depressed or anxious). This results not only because of physiologic effects on the body, but also secondary to learned responses (Riley, 1991). The framework for this proposed nursing plan of care for adolescents suffering with BN, as described in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV) (American Psychiatric Association, 1994), is guided by Roy's Adaptation Model (1984). This outpatient group plan incorporates many aspects of addiction, nutritional, cognitive-behavioral, relapse prevention, and family therapy techniques and models. The plan outlined in this article is offered as a foundation for nursing practice and research development. Within an addiction model, BN is viewed as a primary, chronic, and progressive illness from which individuals can be helped to physical, psychological, and spiritual recovery. Key to the addiction model is the disease concept. This concept defines BN as an involuntary, biopsychological state and lifts from the person the responsibility and guilt for the development of the disease, but emphasizes the need for responsible management of the problem once it exists. Because many bulimics are embarrassed by their inabilities to control food intake, the disease concept helps break through the denial surrounding the illness. Denial perpetuates the disease and associated feelings of depression, shame, and powerlessness (Riley, 1991). The group context provides a safe, supportive, and empathetic environment in which group members are guided to challenge each other's denial, magical thinking, and other cognitive and behavior mal-adaptations (Riley, 1991). Adolescents place special importance on what their peers think is acceptable, thereby learning that their problems, including bulimia, are not unique fosters sharing with less denial (Cramer-Azima, 1992). Finding out they are not alone produces a tremendous sense of relief and instills hope (Riley, 1991). Group therapists working with adolescents must be active in setting boundaries and rules, and initially are more directive. This directiveness should lessen as the group matures and its climate begins to favor self-closure and problem solving (Cramer-Azima, 1992). Therapists must also be aware of the potential for group members' sharing of maladaptive behaviors, such as purging methods and stealing techniques (Pilote, 1998). These behaviors should be immediately confronted within the group.",

L’enuresie nocturne (plus de 2 fois par semaine) toucherait 8 % des enfants de moins de 4 ans et demi et 1,5 % des enfants de moins de 9 ans et demi. Elle peut persister jusqu’a 19 ans… Le NICE rappelle qu’il ne s’agit pas d’une « faute» et que les « punitions » n’ont aucun role therapeutique… Il faut donc d’abord informer les enfants et leurs familles et leur donner des conseils pratiques immediats pour limiter l’impact (protections et vetements de nuit adaptes). Une enuresie recente doit faire rechercher une infection urinaire ou un diabete ; apres quelques mois de possibles facteurs declenchants (maladie recente, trouble emotionnel…) qui peuvent necessiter une prise en charge specifique. L’evaluation est multifactorielle (symptomes de jour, autres problemes, notamment de constipation, troubles du developpement, du comportement, de l’attention ou de l’apprentissage, problemes familiaux…). Une evaluation en milieu specialise peut etre indispensable en cas d’incontinence diurne, d’antecedents d’infection urinaire, d’anomalies congenitales ou de troubles comportementaux majeurs, notamment en cas de suspicion de maltraitance. Le NICE recommande de ne pas restreindre les apports hydriques de la journee, ne pas reveiller l’enfant la nuit, sauf circonstances exceptionnelles, de lui rappeler d’utiliser les toilettes a heures regulieres durant la journee. La place des differents traitements alarmes, desmopressine en premiere intention, recours a un avis specialise en cas d’echec avant utilisation d’anticholinergiques ou d’imipramine, est bien precisee. Le NICE rappelle qu’il est habituellement inutile d’envisager un traitement avant l’âge de 7 ans, meme si certaines mesures peuvent etre envisagees a partir de 5 ans. 1.

Avoidance can also feature prominently. In women, OCD commonly starts in the early 20s, and is often chronic; thus it coincides with the typical childbearing years for many women and pregnancy and/or birth is a consistently cited triggering factor.1\n\nPerinatal OCD is OCD that occurs in pregnancy or postnatally. It may be a new and sudden onset in those with no previous history or an exacerbation of existing OCD. Symptoms commonly orientate around the baby and caregiving. Pregnancy onset has been more associated with fears of accidentally harming the baby by contamination (for example, ‘my hands may be contaminated’), with related compulsions including excessive washing, restriction of diet and, postnatally, avoidance of activities and contact with others such as playgroups, and minimal child handling, reducing mother–child interaction. Postnatal onset has been more associated with fears of deliberately harming the baby (for example, ‘I could touch my baby inappropriately’), associated with avoidance of …",

      "title": "Changes of Sympathovagal Balance Measured by Heart Rate Variability in Gastroparetic Patients Treated with Gastric Electrical Stimulation",
      "abstract": "Gastroparesis, a gastric motility disorder characterized by delayed gastric emptying without evidence of mechanical obstruction (Nilsson, 1996), clinically presents as nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, with a compromised nutritional state. Gastroparesis has multiple etiologies but the dominant ones are diabetes (DM), idiopathic (ID) and post-surgical (P-S). Frequent hospital admissions, and severe symptoms make gastroparesis patients socially restricted (Soykan et al., 1998). Approximately one third of gastroparesis cases are caused by diabetes mellitus. Diabetic gastroparesis may be attributed to impaired motor activity involving gastric hypomotility and unpropagated contractions (lack of peristalsis) and/or impaired myoelectrical activity explained by abnormal frequency of the gastric slow wave (dysrhythmia), low amplitude and/or uncoupling of slow waves (You et al., 1980; Telander et al.,1978; Geldof et al.,1986; Chen et al., 1992). The most common treatment for gastroparesis is the use of prokinetic agents, such as metoclopramide, erythromycin and domperidone. However, only two agents are currently available in the USA, metoclopramide and erythromycin. Side effects from these agents result in up to 40% of patients being unable to tolerate chronic use (Sturm et al., 1999). Those who are refractory or intolerant to prokinetic agents often undergo abdominal surgery for the placement of a feeding jejunostomy tube which is only for nutritional support and does not improve gastric motility (Reardon et al., 1989; Ejskjaer et al., 1999). Gastric electrical stimulation (GES) is an emerging therapy for refractory gastroparesis. Currently two types of GES have been investigated for treatment of gastroparesis: (i) longpulse or high energy with low frequency stimulation and (ii) short-pulse or low energy with high frequency stimulation. Gastric electrical stimulation (GES) with short pulses and low energy (Enterra Device) was FDA approved in 2000 as a therapeutic option in the management of refractory gastroparesis (Familoni et al., 1997; Forster et al., 2001; Abell et al., 2002, 2003). Long-pulse and high energy stimulation, another approach to GES, achieves gastric pacing and represents a promising new treatment for gastric motility disorders (Hocking et al., 1992; McCallum et al., 1998; Lin et al., 1998). In this method, the electrical stimulus is composed of repetitive single pulses with a pulse width in the order of",

Las pruebas complementarias no estan indicadas de forma rutinaria si la exploracion fisica es normal y no existen signos de alarma. El tratamiento debe individualizarse e incluye educacion sanitaria, terapia motivacional, dispositivos de alarma y farmacos. Los dispositivos de alarma son de eleccion y requieren implicacion del paciente y la familia. La desmopresina se prefiere en ninos con menos de tres noches mojadas a la semana, volumen miccional maximo diurno (VMMD) superior al 75%, edad superior a 9 anos o fracaso del sistema de alarma. El pediatra tambien debera abordar los problemas psicologicos y sociales que puedan derivarse de la EN. EnglishNocturnal enuresis (NE) refers to nocturnal urinary incontinence that occurs at least once a month for three months in children aged five years old or older. NE is more common in males and is usually a primary and monosymptomatic NE. Primary NE is one in which a minimum continence of six months has not been achieved previously. Monosymptomatic NE is not associated with daytime nephro urological symptoms. NE is often associated with comorbidities such as constipation, sleep disorders or ADHD. Genetic predisposition, personal nephro urological history and psychosocial disorders are some of the risk factors for NE in children. Diagnosis is clinical and is based on a detailed medical history, complete physical examination, and voiding and drinking diaries. The differential diagnosis is very broad, encompassing other pathologies such as diabetes mellitus, urinary tract infection, nephro urological diseases, pinworms and neurological disorders. Complementary tests are not routinely indicated if the physical examination is normal and there are not warning signs. Treatment should be individualized and includes health education, motivational therapy, alarm devices, and drugs. Alarm devices are of choice and require patient and family involvement. Desmopressin is preferred in children with less than three wet nights per week, maximum voiding volume during day-time (MVVDT) greater than 75%, age greater than 9 years, or failure of the alarm system. The pediatrician will also need to solve psychological and social problems that may result from NE.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The eating disorders are a group of conditions, central to which is a disturbance of eating behaviour. The main diagnoses are anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, in both of which there is an extreme concern with weight and shape. In anorexia nervosa, persistent dietary restriction leads to weight loss, which may be severe. In bulimia nervosa, the dietary restriction is interrupted by repeated episodes of binge eating (typically followed by self-induced vomiting) and weight is usually unremarkable. Both disorders may be accompanied by medical complications that present to physicians. Anorexia nervosa has the potential to be life-threatening because of the consequences of starvation. Patients may require medical attention for the correction of electrolyte disturbance and sometimes admission to a medical unit for refeeding. The main treatment of eating disorders is psychological. The prognosis of bulimia nervosa is generally good but is less positive for anorexia nervosa.",

Such difficulties can include problems with the placement and manipulation of food in the oral cavity or the physiology of swallowing, or both, and are referred to as dysphagia. Swallowing is a highly complex motor process, requiring neurological control and coordination of breathing and swallowing. Cerebral damage may affect the neurological control of swallowing (Murdoch and Theodoros 2001) and consequently, the child is at increased risk of fluids and food material entering the airway, termed aspiration. According to Reilly et al. (2000) the signs suggestive of aspiration include coughing, choking or deterioration in respiratory status during a feed, noisy or wet breathing, or excessive pharyngeal secretions; sneezing during drinking may also indicate nasopharyngeal incoordination and reflux.",

      "title": "Cognitive Behavior Therapy of Binge Eating Disorder",
      "abstract": "Binge eating disorder (BED) is characterized by recurrent episodes of uncontrollable eating, even when not hungry, until uncomfortably full, occurring at least twice a week for a 6-month period. This is differentiated from bulimia nervosa (BN) by the lack of compensatory mechanisms such as purging/laxative abuse. There are significantly higher levels of psychiatric symptoms in patients with BED as compared to those without BED. Furthermore, depressive symptomatology may increase the patient's vulnerability to binge eating as well as to relapse after treatment. Grazing is defined as eating small amounts of food continuously. BED in the pre-bariatric patient can manifest as 'grazing' about 2 years post-bariatric surgery. Treatment should be directed at eating behavior, associated psychopathology, weight and psychiatric symptoms. Cognitive behavior therapy is based on changing the patient's erroneous ways of thinking about themselves, the world and how others perceive them. This includes a focus on normalizing food intake as well as challenging dysfunctional thinking, identifying feelings, and developing non-food coping skills. It increases a sense of control and therefore helps the patient adhere to behavior change strategy, as well as improving mood and reducing associated psychopathology. Interpersonal therapy is based on the relationship between negative mood low self-esteem traumatic life events, interpersonal functioning and the patient's eating behavior. The rationale being that eating represents maladaptive coping with underlying difficulties. While psychotherapy either CBT or IPT leads to decrease in disordered eating behaviors and improved psychiatric symptoms, it has little effect on weight hence; its benefit is optimal when used in conjunction with bariatric surgery.",

Intercurrent illnesses sometimes develop in spite of bed rest, as when myocardial infarction occurs during convalescence from a pelvic or orthopedic operation. In most cases the evil effects of complete bed rest are potentiated by anesthesia, narcotics or other medication or by the results of the original illness. But it must also be recognized that many disturbances of function, such as massive collapse of the lung, attributed to operation, illness, anesthesia or medication have become evident only because the patient was forced to spend hours or days in the dorsal recumbent position. In any discussion of the effects of complete bed rest it is to be borne in mind that the disorders noted may have been aggravated, or even initiated, by a depression",

      "abstract": "Gastroparesis is a neurogastrointestinal disorder of motility in which patients experience symptoms of nausea, vomiting, bloating, early satiety, postprandial fullness, upper abdominal discomfort or pain, and delayed gastric emptying of solids based on scintigraphy or stable isotope breath test when mechanical obstruction has been excluded. Symptoms of gastroparesis may result from diverse pathophysiological mechanisms, including antroduodenal hypomotility, pylorospasm, increased gastric accommodation, and visceral hypersensitivity. The most common etiologies of gastroparesis are idiopathic, diabetic, and postsurgical, and less frequent causes are neurodegenerative disorders (Parkinson's disease), myopathies (scleroderma, amyloidosis), medication-induced (glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists and opioid agents), and paraneoplastic syndrome. This review addresses pharmacologic management of gastroparesis including prokinetic and antiemetic agents, pharmacologic agents targeting the pylorus, and effects of neuromodulators. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Gastroparesis is a neurogastrointestinal motility disorder characterized by delayed gastric emptying without mechanical obstruction with numerous upper gastrointestinal symptoms, including nausea and vomiting. The management of gastroparesis involves nutritional support, medications, and procedures. The only Food and Drug Administration-approved medication for gastroparesis is metoclopramide. This article reviews the pharmacology and efficacy of all classes of antiemetics or prokinetic effects used in gastroparesis. There is still a considerable unmet need for efficacious medications specifically for the treatment of gastroparesis, especially in refractory cases.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is the difficulty to initiate or to maintain sleep. It also has to do with waking up too early at least for a month. A patient with insomnia has daytime consequences such as fatigue, sleepiness, changes in mood, lose of concentration, as well as changes in his social performance and his family relationships, among others. The relationship between this disorder and physical and mental health is important due to the impact that it has on the quality of life and life expectancy of those who suffer from it. Unfortunately, insomnia usually goes unnoticed or untreated, which contributes to the onset or worsening of psychiatric and medical conditions. This exacerbates the problem of insomnia in the elderly people. In relation to the treatment it is recommended: 1) the search and management of secondary causes of insomnia, 2) a non-drug therapy that includes sleep hygiene measures, 3) pharmacotherapy. It is not recommended to start a treatment with a hypnotic drug without rule out medications or diseases that cause or exacerbate insomnia. It is not recommended the use of narcoleptics, melatonin, antihistamines or long half-life benzodiazepines. The consequences include limitations on activities of daily living, loss of functionality, impaired quality of life, increased morbidity and mortality, as well as the worsening of preexisting chronic conditions.El insomnio es la dificultad para conciliar o mantener el sueño; también consiste en despertar demasiado temprano al menos durante un mes. Un paciente con insomnio presenta consecuencias diurnas como fatiga, somnolencia, deterioro de la memoria, cambios en el estado de ánimo, en la concentración, así como en su desempeño social o familiar, entre otros. La asociación de este padecimiento con la salud física y mental es importante debido al impacto que tiene en la calidad y la esperanza de vida de los que lo padecen. Desafortunadamente, el insomnio suele pasar desapercibido o no tratarse, lo cual contribuye al empeoramiento de condiciones médicas y psiquiátricas. Esto se acentúa más en los adultos mayores, grupo por demás vulnerable. En relación con el tratamiento se recomienda aplicar la siguiente combinación: 1) la búsqueda y el manejo de causas secundarias de insomnio, 2) alguna terapia no farmacológica que incluya medidas de higiene del sueño, 3) tratamiento farmacológico. No es recomendable comenzar el tratamiento con un hipnótico sin haber descartado fármacos o enfermedades que provoquen o exacerben este padecimiento. Tampoco se recomienda el uso de neurolépticos, melatonina, antihistamínicos o benzodiacepinas de vida media larga. Las consecuencias incluyen limitación en las actividades de la vida diaria, pérdida de la funcionalidad, deterioro en la calidad de vida, incremento en la morbimortalidad, además del empeoramiento de las condiciones crónicas prexistentes.",

This syndrome typically affects children aged 3–12 years. Another episodic syndrome that causes recurrent gastrointestinal disturbance is cyclical vomiting syndrome. These syndromes describe periodic symptoms in children who commonly have a family history of migraine, have co-occurrence of migraine, or have an increased risk of clinical evolution to migraine in later years. Abdominal migraine has been reported in adults; however, it is believed to be much less common. The diagnosis of abdominal migraine is made clinically, but if any red flags are raised—including failure to thrive, unexplained or recurrent fevers, chronic diarrhea, anemia, or family history of inflammatory bowel disease—concern should be raised for an alternative diagnosis and diagnostic evaluation should ensue. Treatment strategies are often extrapolated from migraine treatment and should include both pharmacological and nonpharmacological options.",

Enhanced perception of different physiologically occurring gut stimuli can result from numerous mechanisms, including such fundamentally different but possibly interrelated processes as changes in sensory transmission (in the periphery or centrally), alterations in endogenous pain modulation, or even changes in gut directed attentional mechanisms.3Any of these mechanisms alone or in combination could produce some of the most prevalent clinical manifestations of visceral hypersensitivity in IBS: sensations of abdominal fullness (in the absence of excessive distension), abdominal pain (in the absence of detectable tissue injury), sigmoid tenderness during palpation or during endoscopic examination, or the sensation of incomplete rectal evacuation (in the absence of a full rectum).\n\nBased on several studies in the rat, demonstrating that acute mucosal inflammation can produce sensitisation of primary afferents as well as dorsal horn neurones thereby resulting in acute visceral hyperalgesia,3 the concept of targeting and testing candidate drugs for their visceroanalgesic potential has been widely accepted as a worthwhile endeavour by industry and academia alike.4 The strategies pursued by optimists in this field are variations of the following sequence: (1) identify receptors or ion channels on visceral afferent neurones; (2) select compounds targeted at these membrane proteins; (3) evaluate candidate compounds for their ability to reduce behavioural responses of the rat or other rodents to colorectal distension (ideally in the normal colon and following some type of acute sensitisation); (4) evaluate if the compound has visceroanalgesic properties on …",

      "abstract": "The difficulty in falling asleep, in maintaining sleep, and early awakening is common in primary care medical practice. Health care providers must be knowledgeable about sleep disorders presenting as poor sleep. There should be an organized and systematic approach to sleep problems. It has been estimated that at least 9% of adults have insomnia, although the prevalence may be as high as 22%. By definition, primary insomnia is a complaint of difficulty in initiating or maintaining sleep at night for at least a month, and it is associated with daytime tiredness and functional impairment. Many times, the complaint of poor sleep is associated with another primary sleep disorder like sleep disordered breathing, restless legs syndrome (RLS), and circadian rhythm disorders or with medical conditions like chronic pain, respiratory disorders and neurologic conditions (parkinsonism, Alzheimer's disease, and other neurodegenerative diseases). Psychiatric disorders have a bilateral relationship with insomnia. In major depression disorder (MDD), insomnia manifests months before symptoms of depression in nearly 40–50% of patients. Chronic insomnia, if not treated, can lead to depression. Pharmacologic treatment is effective in adjustment or short-term insomnia. The most effective management of insomnia is a combination of behavioral and pharmacologic therapy. According to the most excepted studies, a combination of behavior and pharmacologic treatment is considered to be most effective. The combination of the cognitive pharmacotherapy is noted to be superior to any other alternative treatments according to a recent randomized control clinical trial. In another trial, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is noted to be superior to pharmacotherapy. The effects of the CBT could last up to 2 years. A thorough investigation into the causes of primary and secondary insomnia is warranted mostly from the patient perspective.",

Stressors can trigger a variety of stress reactions, including psychological, physiological, and behavioural ones. A multitude of health problems that impact most of the body's systems are brought on by prolonged exposure to such stress. Both physical and mental health is impacted by stress. Perhaps not everyone's bodies react to stress in the same way. Depending on the person's genotype, sex, age, physiological conditions, and prior experiences, it might be different. However, some of these effects apply to everyone. Additionally, stress may work in conjunction with other pathogenic factors to induce gastrointestinal illness. Higher amounts of corticoids and adrenaline are primarily responsible for the effects. Disrupted eating habits, acid reflux, diarrhoea, or constipation are common indications of stress. Stress should be managed by making tiny changes to attitude and way of life, even though it is impossible to escape stress in day-to-day existence.",

      "abstract": "&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Background:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Upper gastrointestinal disorders typically present with common symptoms. The most relevant non-mucosal diseases are gastroparesis, functional dyspepsia and rumination syndrome. The literature pertaining to these 3 conditions was reviewed. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Key Messages:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Gastroparesis is characterized by delayed gastric emptying in the absence of mechanical obstruction of the stomach. The cardinal symptoms include postprandial fullness (early satiety), nausea, vomiting and bloating. The most frequently encountered causes of these symptoms are mechanical obstruction (pyloric stenosis), iatrogenic disease, gastroparesis, functional dyspepsia, cyclical vomiting and rumination syndrome. The most common causes of gastroparesis are neuropathic disorders such as diabetes, idiopathic, post-vagotomy and scleroderma among myopathic disorders. Principles of management of gastroparesis include exclusion of mechanical obstruction with imaging and iatrogenic causes with careful medication and past surgical history. Prokinetics and anti-emetics are the mainstays of treatment. Functional dyspepsia is characterized by the same symptoms as gastroparesis; in addition to delayed gastric emptying, pathophysiological abnormalities include accelerated gastric emptying, impaired gastric accommodation and gastric or duodenal hypersensitivity to distension and nutrients. Novel treatments include tricyclic antidepressants in patients with normal gastric emptying, acotiamide (acetyl cholinesterase inhibitor) and 5-HT&lt;sub&gt;1A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor agonists such as buspirone. Rumination syndrome is characterized by repetitive regurgitation of gastric contents occurring within minutes after a meal. Episodes often persist for 1-2 h after the meal, and the regurgitant consists of partially digested food that is recognizable in its taste. Regurgitation is typically effortless or preceded by a sensation of belching. This has been summarized as a ‘meal in, meal out, day in, day out' behavior for weeks or months, differentiating rumination from gastroparesis. Patients often have a background of psychological disorder or a prior eating disorder. Treatment is based on behavioral modification. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Conclusion:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Precise identification of the cause and pathophysiology of upper gastrointestinal symptoms is essential for optimal management.",

      "abstract": "When clinicians label a child as having a functional disorder there is often a pejorative connotation that the symptoms are psychological, imagined, or faked. These symptoms range from chronic abdominal pain to recurrent headaches to fatigue. We say the complaints are functional because we are unable to demonstrate any structural or biochemical abnormality causing them. The degree to which we go searching for these abnormalities varies from case to case and often depends oh our own clinical experience, insecurities, and demands of the patient's family. Labeling a child as having a functional complaint can put a tremendous burden on the child and family, because if this concept is presented improperly (as implied above), it can suggest that it is their fault there are symptoms arid that if they “got their act together” the symptoms would melt away. Functional gastrointestinal disorders are defined as conditions in which a variable combination of chronic or recurrent gastrointestinal symptoms are present in the absence of demonstrable disease. There may indeed be physiologic abnormalities underlying the symptoms, but at the present time we are unable to detect them. We make a diagnosis based on symptoms, not on demonstrable abnormalities in physical examination or laboratory tests. A number of common pediatric diagnoses fall into this category, including infant regurgitation, chronic nonspecific diarrhea, irritable bowel syndrome, non-ulcer dyspepsia, infant dyschezia, and functional constipation.

      "abstract": "Irritable bowel syndrome is a common functional gastrointestinal disorder that greatly impacts on quality of life due to gastrointestinal complaints such as pain or altered stool habits. Based on the biopsychosocial model the severity of the disease is affected by the combination of physiological processes, social aspects and psychological factors. While treatment approaches mainly focused on the reduction of gut complaints by dietary means or medication, psychotherapy is becoming an alternative or additional approach with very good evidence, especially in light of associated psychiatric comorbidities (e. g. depression, anxiety disorder). Often psychiatric symptoms/comorbidities increase the probability of a complicated course of the disease with a reciprocal interaction of gut complaints and psychiatric symptoms. Behavioral therapy, psychodynamic psychotherapy, hypnotherapy, mindfulness interventions and other psychotherapeutic methods are used to increase coping as well as disease control and to restructure dysregulated cognitive processes. The current review focuses on psychosocial aspects of the irritable bowel syndrome and discusses the benefit of psychotherapeutic interventions.Das Reizdarmsyndrom ist eine häufige funktionelle gastrointestinale Störung, die aufgrund wiederkehrender gastrointestinaler Beschwerden wie Bauchschmerzen oder Stuhlveränderungen die Lebensqualität erheblich beeinträchtigen kann. Basierend auf dem biopsychosozialen Krankheitsmodell wird die Ausprägung des Reizdarmsyndroms durch die Kombination von veränderten physiologischen Prozessen, sozialen Aspekten und psychischen Faktoren beeinflusst. Während der Fokus bisher auf der Linderung der Darmbeschwerden mittels Diät sowie medikamentöser Therapie lag, stellen Psychotherapieverfahren angesichts der starken Assoziation mit psychischen Komorbiditäten (u. a. Depression, Angststörung) zunehmend alternative oder ergänzende Behandlungsmethoden mit mittlerweile sehr guter Evidenz dar. Grundsätzlich können zusätzliche psychische Begleitsymptome die Wahrscheinlichkeit komplizierter Krankheitsverläufe erhöhen, wobei sich psychische Symptome und Darmbeschwerden maßgeblich gegenseitig beeinflussen. Mithilfe von kognitiver Verhaltenstherapie, psychodynamischer Psychotherapie, Hypnotherapie, achtsamkeitsbasierter Therapie und anderen psychotherapeutischen Verfahren sollen die Krankheitsbewältigung und -kontrolle gesteigert und fehlregulierte kognitive Prozesse umstrukturiert werden. In dieser Übersichtsarbeit fokussieren wir uns auf den psychosozialen Aspekt des Reizdarmsyndroms und diskutieren den Nutzen der psychotherapeutischen Verfahren.",

      "title": "Urinary Incontinence1",
      "abstract": "The extent, misery, and costs of urinary incontinence are well known to readers of the Journal. Although much has been accomplished, there are still formidable barriers to clinicians’ efforts to control incontinence. These include physician and patient acceptance of incontinence as an expected accompaniment of aging; a lack of detailed knowledge of the relationships of incontinence with associated conditions such as dementia, depression, urinary infections, and vaginitis; scant empirical information to evaluate symptoms and physical signs; and little knowledge of the operating characteristics (sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value) of urodynamic tests. Excluding acute or transient incontinence caused by sudden, acute illness or environmental conditions,1 established incontinence is usually due to four types, largely distinguished by urological pathology.2 Sphincter weakness incontinence (SWI) or urethral incompetence (UI) is involuntary loss of urine caused by increases in intra-abdominal pressure without bladder muscle contractions. This is usually associated with stress incontinence, the symptom of incontinence with coughing or exertion. Detrusor instability (DI) or detrusor hyperactivity (DH) is caused by involuntary contractions of the detrusor or bladder muscle sufficient to cause incontinence and is frequently associated with the symptom of urge incontinence, the loss of urine associated with a strong desire to void. Overflow incontinence (OI) occurs when bladder pressure exceeds maximal urethral pressure, due either to bladder distension from a urethral obstruction or an atonic bladder. Functional incontinence occurs with and without other pathology in individuals who are unable to toilet themselves independently due to chronic physical, psychological, or neurological dysfunction. Unlike many other medical conditions, currently these diagnoses can not be made by a short history, physical exam, and easily performed laboratory tests. The existing “gold standards'” of incontinence diagnosis—urodynamic testing—reflect a number of different tests, are expensive, and require referral to subspecialists. However, most incontinence is and always will be treated by geriatricians, internists, nurse practitioners, and nurses in the community and longterm care. These professionals need clear, reliable, and reproducible data on the ability of history questions and clinical bedside tests to detect treatable urinary pathology that causes incontinence. It is clearly necessary to refer certain patients for urodynamics, but the data should suggest how those patients can be identified and delineate the risks of empirical treatment and steps necessary to avoid these risks. Decision rules3 and algorithms4,5 have been proposed, but as of yet little data from comprehensive studies of the incontinent elderly support them. In this issue of the Journal, Wells et al. present data on the clinical characteristics, urodynamics, and the diagnostic usefulness of common tests in a large sample of women with established incontinence. They reconfirm the dismal suspicion of most geriatricians that while incontinence is a chronic problem and many patients do seek care for it, few continue with long-term therapy. In this well-educated, largely upper middle class sample, chronic diseases were common (86%), and the incontinence was not associated with significant dementia, functional disability, or negative health status. Wells et al. identified more SWI or UI incompetency (77%), relatively less DI or DH (25%), and about half the number of patients with normal bladders (7%) and overflow (9%) than seen in other studies of incontinent women.5,6 This probably represents the relatively healthy population, although the use of three separate tests (radiological, clinical, and urodynamic) for urethral incompetence may have identified more of these patients than other studies with less intense evaluations. Clinical diagnoses, easily made by the nurse practitioner using both symptoms and a “bedside'” test, were compared to urodynamic diagnoses and found to be accurate in 55%, over all diagnoses. As a first step in validating decision rules or office procedures for diagnosis, the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of incontinence symptoms, signs, and tests can be determined. These concepts are widely used7 in determining the applicability of clinical data to the diagnosis of disease. In this determination, the diagnoses are made with the best available standard—“the gold standard.'” Sensitivity refers to the percentage of patients with the diagnosis who have the characteristic (symptom, positive test) in question. Specificity refers to the fraction of patients without the diagnosis who do not have the characteristic. The positive predictive value is the fraction of patients with a characteristic who have the diagnosis. The negative predictive value is the fraction of patients without the characteristic who do not have the diagnosis. Sensitivity and specificity are attributes of the test or the symptom being evaluated, but predictive values are the characteristics most clinicians rely on as they specify the probability that a particular patient with a positive (or negative) test or symptom does (or does not) have the diagnosis. For the same test or symptom, the predictive value changes with changes in the prevalence of the disease in the population. Consequently, the prevalence of the disease must be available or estimated. The sequence of diagnoses identified and whether an algorithm should aim to exclude diagnoses or confirm them, depend on the characteristics of the tests. Ideally, available procedures should be able to confirm a diagnosis with a high degree of certainty (a high positive predictive value); alternatively, the test may be able to exclude it with a high degree of confidence (a high negative predictive value). The consequences of misdiagnosis should also be considered and be minimal or, at least, risk-free. A decision rule for incontinence should address the four diagnoses of established incontinence, but practically, office procedures for diagnoses exist only for SWI, DI, and OI. Ouslander's test for DI,4 (slowly filling the bladder by catheter while watching for uninhibited contractions) is not empirically established. Patients with overflow or obstruction can have normal postvoid residual bladder volumes, making simple measurement of this characteristic in the office unreliable. However, sphincter weakness can be identified by an office examination, the stress test. Additionally, therapy for SWI—estrogens and alpha agonists,8 carries little risk to patients with other categories of urinary pathology if misdiagnoses are made, unlike therapy for DI (anticholinergics). Consequently, it would appear that the first step in a diagnostic algorithm should be identification of SWI. According to Wells et al., the standing stress test, an examination for urinary leakage while coughing or sneezing with a full bladder, is useful for the diagnosis of SWI. It can be confused with cough-induced DI, as detrusor contractions can be induced by the coughing and cause urinary leakage five to 15 seconds later. However, the results of Wells et al. show that the standing stress test, as conducted in the office, is 50% sensitive for a urodynamic diagnosis of SWI or mixed SWI and DI, and 76% specific, with a positive predictive value of 88%. In other words, using these results in a similar population, there is an 0.88 probability that a patient with a positive stress test in the office would have sphincter weakness later demonstrated at urodynamics. Thus, the risk of false positives is 12%. Using symptoms with the stress test yields a more sensitive test at 94%, but due to a much lower specificity (13%) the positive predictive value drops to 78%. Before these results can be used with complete confidence, they need careful confirmation and extension to other populations with a lower prevalence of SWI (where the positive predictive value would be lower) and to populations of incontinent men. Using similar tests in the office, if these results are confirmed, clinicians can expect to be able to accurately identify about 50% of women with SWI. The women with a negative test could have SWI, DI, obstructions, or atonic bladders. A bedside test for DI might be able to separate out a group of patients with a high probability of DI and allow them to be effectively treated without initial urodynamics. A postvoid residual measurement, if high, may identify many of the patients with overflow incontinence, who could be referred to urologists.3 Each of these steps, and the role of therapy for patients who do not show evidence of a specific diagnosis, need careful study and validation. These studies should include carefully defined, large populations, specific diagnostic criteria acceptable to experts in urodynamics, and careful attention to the analysis to provide the data and validated approaches clinicians need to treat incontinence. The work by Wells et al. begins this process.",

      "title": "Functional gastrointestinal disorders among healthcare professionals—hidden in plain sight?",
      "abstract": "Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) are chronic or recurrent gastrointestinal (GI) disorders without a clear cause, often associated with motility disturbance, visceral hypersensitivity, changes in gut microbiota, and immune response.1 FGIDs comprising irritable bowel syndrome(IBS), functional dyspepsia(FD), and functional constipation are incompletely understood and with a complex pathophysiology, accounting for up to a third of referrals to gastroenterology clinics, with symptoms such as epigastric pain, early satiety, postprandial fullness, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and constipation.2Indeed, nearly half the general population could meet the criteria for a FGID at any given time, what with the considerable overlap among conditions, more than two-thirds having seen a doctor in preceding 12 months, 40% using regular medication, and up to a third having had potentially unnecessary and avoidable surgery (such as hysterectomy or cholecystectomy), to address their symptoms.3 It is now universally acknowledged that FGIDs have multidimensional and often negative effects on patients' personal, psychological, professional, and social well-being, with ramifications ranging from impaired quality of life to societal costs including (but not limited to) healthcare expenditure and diminished productivity, of similar magnitude to organic gastrointestinal disease, underscoring their fundamental importance to healthcare systems and society at large.3, 4 The wide prevalence of FGIDs in the general population notwithstanding, less is known about FGIDs among medical and healthcare professionals. Healthcare professionals (HCPs) play a key role in the well-being of patients, facing a myriad of challenges on a daily basis, ranging from long and irregular working hours, high stress levels, and the need to make timely or critical decisions, often in a high-pressure environment. Although physicians and nurses do their best to provide outstanding care to their patients, they often do not prioritize their own self-care, with resultant negative impacts on their physical and mental health.5 A web-based survey from Ontario demonstrated an increased likelihood of IBS (Odds Ratio [OR] 1.32) for every hour of sleep deprivation among resident doctors, after adjustment for age and gender.6 Similarly, a study from Michigan demonstrated that rotating shift nurses had a significantly higher prevalence of abdominal pain compared with day shift (81% vs. 54%, P < 0.0001) and night shift workers (61%, P = 0.003), implicating disruption of circadian rhythm from shift work, on-call shifts, inadequate sleep quality, and psychological stress in the risk of FGID.7 Adding further perspective to these observations, in this issue of JGH Open, Nagarethinam et al. report a cross-sectional survey assessing the prevalence and associations of FGIDs among HCPs from a tertiary Australian hospital setting.8 Between January 2017 and June 2018, 274 HCPs were surveyed, and data were collected for demographics, medical role, work hours, sleep habits, stress levels (frequency and severity), and dietary factors. Risk factors for FGIDs and their symptoms based on the Rome III criteria were assessed using a self-report questionnaire (FGID-Q), and quality of life (QoL) was assessed for its impact on work, leisure, relationships, and social activities.9 Responses were scored using Likert scales, numerical scales, and open text questions. Participants were considered to have FGID if they met Rome III criteria. Only FD and IBS were specifically examined in this study. The study involved 274 respondents (77% female, median age 35 years) consisting mostly of nurses (66%), followed by doctors (17%) and allied health professionals (10%). Of the respondents, 54% had experienced some GI symptoms three or more times per week, with 46% of these reporting concurrent changes in stool frequency and/or consistency. The three most common GI symptoms experienced were early satiety (42%), non-epigastric/lower abdominal pain (31%), and epigastric pain (22%). FGIDs were identified in 23% of respondents, (2% IBS, 19% FD, and 2% both). Nearly a third (30%) of respondents experienced an adverse impact on their QoL due to GI symptoms. The investigators identified a number of risk factors associated with GI symptoms and FGIDs. The risk factors for GI symptoms included female sex (58% vs. 38%, [OR] 2.3, P = 0.006), Caucasian versus Asian ethnicity (59% vs. 35%, OR 2.7, P = 0.002), high stress levels (67% vs. 40%, OR 3.1, P < 0.001), and irregular working hours (62% vs. 46%, OR 1.9, P = 0.019). Multivariable analysis identified being easily stressed (OR 2.7, P = 0.001) and female sex (OR 2.4, P = 0.037) as predictors of GI symptoms, while Asian ethnicity was protective (OR 0.42, P = 0.027). For FGIDs, higher prevalence was observed in respondents who often felt stressed (27% vs. 10%, OR 3.4, P = 0.013) or felt easily stressed (29% vs. 17%, OR 2.1, P = 0.015), as well as in nurses compared with other HCPs (27% vs. 16%, OR 1.9, P = 0.049). FGID rates were similar between males (23%) and females (23%). Multivariate modeling showed that being often stressed (OR 4.1, P = 0.011), with working as a nurse tending toward significance (OR 2.0, P = 0.057), was associated with FGIDs. Intriguingly, GI symptoms and FGIDs were not found to be associated with age, smoking, alcohol intake, sleep deprivation, or dietary factors (including red meat and fruit/vegetable intake). Nagarethinam and colleagues are to be commended for tackling an under-researched area of great importance. The incisive identification of factors associated with risk of GI and FGIDs, if not entirely surprising, is sobering. The study findings are concerning as FGIDs can negatively impact HCPs' work and personal life, leading to reduced productivity and burnout.10 The high prevalence of FGIDs among HCPs has potentially serious implications for any healthcare system. Firstly, HCPs with FGIDs may experience reduced QOL and work productivity, impacting patient care.10, 11 For instance, they may need to take time off work or be less focused with patients, with potential risk of medical errors and its undesirable or serious consequences. Often hidden in plain sight is resilience among medical professionals, which underpins the moral fabric of professionalism and commitment.12 However, it is entirely plausible that this might delay HCPs from seeking help for assessment of stress or FGIDs and related symptoms. HCPs with FGIDs may consider the perception of stigma and discrimination from colleagues who may not understand the nature and impact of these disorders and in turn act as a deterrent to any referral for assessment.11, 13 Although considered inversely proportional, the boundaries between resilience and burnout are not immutable.12 Compassion satisfaction (the sense of satisfaction, meaning, and joy experienced from caring for people in challenging situations) must consider the delicate balance with fatigue and its consequences as an important determinant for healthcare professionals' QoL and indeed for healthcare itself.14 Future studies should examine resilience and burnout as well as factors associated with identification and referral for such symptoms including HCP roles and characteristics of the practice and external environments. Healthcare systems must address system issues in the clinical care environment, which are needed to reduce burnout and promote physician well-being. One way to address the issue of FGIDs among HCPs could be to promote healthy lifestyles and stress management. Hospitals and healthcare organizations can encourage regular exercise and offer stress management programs such as mindfulness-based stress reduction and cognitive-behavioral therapy.10 These interventions can improve the physical and mental health of HCPs, leading to reduced levels of stress, improved sleep quality, and increased work productivity and indeed quality of patient care delivered. Creating a supportive work environment that promotes open communication and access to mental health services is crucial. HCPs should be encouraged to seek help if they experience symptoms of FGIDs or other health conditions. Mental health programs, such as employee assistance programs, counseling services, and peer support groups, can provide valuable resources for HCPs and improve their well-being. Additionally, interventions that focus on improving workplace culture, reducing workload, and providing access to counseling and support groups can also contribute to reducing the prevalence of FGIDs among HCPs, ensuring they have the resources needed to effectively perform their roles without experiencing burnout or job dissatisfaction.15 This study by Nagarethinam and colleagues and its sobering observations raise several important questions, challenging our perceptions about HCPs, indeed ourselves. The limitations of the study, while reflecting a paucity of literature, make a compelling case for clinicians to pause and consider our perceptions and paradigms regarding what constitutes HCP well-being and how we address gaps in recognizing and addressing them. We may have only scratched the surface, but as these questions seek better answers, it also fills us with renewed optimism of a better future for those who provide professional expertise and care and for our patients for whom we care.",

      "abstract": "Virtually any medical condition can cause sleep disruption. The incidence of insomnia increases with age as medical problems increasingly occur, and patients with chronic insomnia are more likely to develop adverse health outcomes due to medical disease. There are multiple ways in which insomnia may be caused or aggravated by medical illness or bodily injury. Unpleasant stimuli can directly impede initiation of sleep, or they may cause frequent arousals or awakenings. Changes in basic systemic physiology (such as disorders of ventilation) may produce similar disruption in sleep continuity. There may be humoral changes that have direct neurochemical or neurophysiological effects, augmenting vigilance and lowering the threshold to arousal from sleep. The effects of acute and subacute sleep disruption can lead to chronic psychophysiological insomnia by creating the anticipation of disturbed sleep and by altering circadian entrainment, further accentuating the disruptive effects of the underlying medical condition. Difficulties with insomnia may persist long after the causative medical condition has been effectively managed.",

      "title": "Anorexia Nervosa",
      "abstract": "Anorexia nervosa (AN) is characterized by restricted eating and a relentless pursuit of thinness that tends to present in females during adolescence according to DSM-IV (Table 1). Individuals with AN exhibit an ego-syntonic resistance to eating and a powerful pursuit of weight loss, yet are paradoxically preoccupied with food and eating rituals to the point of obsession. Individuals have a distorted body image and, even when emaciated, tend to see themselves as \"fat,\" express denial of being underweight, and compulsively overexercise. Two types of eating-related behavior are seen in AN. In restricting-type anorexia (AN), individuals lose weight purely by dieting without binge eating or purging. In binge-eating/purging-type anorexia, individuals also restrict their food intake to lose weight but have a periodic disinhibition of restraint and engage in binge eating and/or purging, also seen in bulimia nervosa (BN). Anorexia nervosa is often kept hidden by patients who are excessively preoccupied by their current body weight/shape and are ashamed of any compensatory behaviors they engage in. Illness often becomes apparent when patients become emaciated from gradually losing weight or in the purging subtype when patients become physiologically unstable from excessive self-induced loss of fluids or electrolytes. Onset is typically around puberty and is usually preceded by anxiety disorders and followed by a prolonged clinical course with the highest mortality for any psychiatric illness. Outcome is often hindered by an unwillingness to seek treatment. A limited understanding of etiological mechanisms and the lack of powerful treatments are major impediments to providing effective care. Still, there is evidence supporting cautious optimism regarding the development of more effective therapy. For example, although there are no U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved medications for AN, some short-term studies suggest that second-generation antipsychotics may be beneficial. For adolescents who develop AN before the age of 18, Maudsley family therapy may be an effective alternative.",

      "abstract": "Swallow syncope is a rare dysautonomic syndrome characterized by temporary loss of consciousness upon swallowing solid foods or liquids, displaying primarily in individuals with an underlying structural or functional esophageal or cardiac pathology. However, the evidence also suggests that isolated vagal dysfunction or abnormal reactions of esophageal mechanoreceptors after mechanical irritation, demyelination, or trauma can potentially evoke a cardioinhibitory response or vasodepression upon swallowing. We present a case of a 49-year-old otherwise healthy female patient who developed swallow syncope two weeks after whiplash neck injury acquired in a rear-end collision. After no evident anatomical and/or functional cardiac or esophageal pathology was diagnosed using several diagnostic procedures, the final diagnosis was confirmed by a provocative tilt-table test while ingesting solid food. Subsequently, a dual-chamber pacemaker was implanted, relieving the patient from troublesome symptoms. Abnormal reactions of esophageal mechanoreceptors to stimuli associated with food ingestion and/or dysfunction of afferent and efferent vagal fibers due to stretch injury and related neck trauma (acquired during the car accident) may be the leading pathophysiological mechanisms of swallow syncope in our patient.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Dysphagia is a sensation of food being \"stuck\" up in its passage from the mouth to stomach. It is of two main types, oropharyngeal dysphagia, and esophageal dysphagia. In oropharyngeal dysphagia, there is difficulty in transferring the food from the mouth to upper esophagus. Thus, this dysphagia is also called as transfer dysphagia. It occurs within 1 st 1-2 s of the swallow. We also call this dysphagia as instant dysphagia. It is almost always associated with sinobronchial symptoms. The second type of dysphagia is esophageal dysphagia in which there is difficulty in passing the food from upper esophagus to the stomach. The two main mechanisms responsible for dysphagia are either a problem with the motor function of oropharynx or esophagus (neuromuscular causes) or mechanical narrowing of oropharynx or esophagus (mechanical dysphagia). As this dysphagia occurs a little later in the act of swallowing, we can call it delayed dysphagia. The mechanical cause of dysphagia includes benign strictures, malignancies, webs and rings, retropharyngeal abscesses, Zenker′s diverticulum, cricopharyngeal bar, and some vascular causes. We report an 80-year-old male with vascular dysphagia.",

      "abstract": "Research supports anecdotal evidence that eating disorders often initially develop in conjunction with adolescent transitions, but evidence is growing that other transitions, including menopause, can also trigger these disorders. Over the course of more than three decades of working with and supervising therapists working with individuals with a wide range of eating-related symptoms, including anorexia, bulimia, compulsive overeating, binge eating, avoidant/restrictive eating, and other variations, I have often seen that even small changes can also trigger the behaviors. For example, a number of clients report that they binge on Sunday nights as they start thinking about going back to work the next day. Visits to family (not necessarily a small transition, of course) are also frequent triggers.This article will address some of the possible interplay between unmanageable and/or unformulated affects, on the one hand, and shifts in an individual's sense of self, on the other, which can occur in the course of a transition. Clinical material from my long-term, two-part work with a client who developed symptoms in adolescence and had a recurrence during COVID will illustrate some of these complex interactions and some of the ways that an integrative, psychodynamically-oriented framework can be used to work with these issues.",

      "abstract": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), the illness caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), involves other body organs besides the lungs. In recovered patients, post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 may include dysautonomia, in which changes in functioning of ≥1 components of the autonomic nervous system (ANS) adversely affect health. This viewpoint focuses on the dysautonomia postural tachycardia syndrome (POTS). POTS is characterized by a sustained heart rate increment of ≥30 beats/min within 10 minutes of standing or head-up tilt. Cardiologic symptoms include chest pain, palpitations, exercise intolerance, and orthostatic intolerance. Other symptoms may include fatigue, \"brain fog,\" gastrointestinal issues (e.g., abdominal pain, bloating, gastroparesis, and nausea), chronic pain (e.g., headache, temperomandibular joint disorder, and fibromyalgia), and sleep abnormalities. Comorbidities include Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, mast cell activation syndrome, sensory neuropathy, or autoimmune disorders (e.g., lupus and Sjogren syndrome). These aspects extend beyond cardiology. Both post-acute sequelae of COVID-19 and POTS manifest as multi-system, multi-disciplinary syndromes. Thinking in terms of the \"extended ANS\" (EAS) may help comprehend how these syndromes come about and how to test for and treat them.1Goldstein D.S. The extended autonomic system, dyshomeostasis, and COVID-19.Clin Auton Res. 2020; 30: 299-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar The ANS has been defined by 3 components: the sympathetic nervous system, the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS), and the enteric nervous system. The EAS expands the meaning of \"autonomic\" in 2 ways, neuroendocrine and neuroimmune. Cannon taught that activation of the sympathetic nervous system and adrenal gland in emergencies helps maintain homeostasis, a word he invented. Since then, other neuroendocrine systems have been described that are closely linked to components of the ANS. These include the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) system, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAS), and the arginine vasopressin system. Across a variety of stressors, responses of plasma epinephrine (EPI) levels are more closely tied to those of adrenocorticotropin (the anterior pituitary hormone of the HPA axis) than of norepinephrine (NE, the neurotransmitter of the sympathetic noradrenergic system (SNS)). These findings support a close association between the sympathetic adrenergic system (SAS) and the HPA axis. The SNS and SAS in turn are closely connected to the RAS. Occupation of β1 adrenoceptors in renal juxtaglomerular cells releases renin, adrenomedullary chromaffin cells possess angiotensin receptors that when occupied evoke EPI secretion, and there is a central neural renin-angiotensin system that participates in the regulation of sympathetic outflow. Angiotensin-converting enzyme type 2 converts angiotensin II (AII) to angiotensin 1–7, which opposes the effects of AII. SARS-CoV-2 enters cells via binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme type 2. In addition to being a pressor and the body's main water-retaining hormone, in the brain vasopressin augments baroreflexive restraint of sympathetic outflows. A second aspect of the EAS is neuroimmunity. Cortisol is well known to be the major anti-inflammatory compound of the HPA axis. The cytokine interleukin 6 activates the HPA axis2Path G. Bornstein S.R. Ehrhart-Bornstein M. Scherbaum W.A. Interleukin-6 and the interleukin-6 receptor in the human adrenal gland: expression and effects on steroidogenesis.J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 1997; 82: 2343-2349Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar and stimulates the production of aldosterone, demonstrating links between the immunological and neuroendocrine facets of the EAS. A cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway involves cytokine-induced increases in vagal afferent traffic and vagal efferent inhibitory effects on inflammasomal cytokine release.3Tracey K.J. Physiology and immunology of the cholinergic antiinflammatory pathway.J Clin Invest. 2007; 117: 289-296Crossref PubMed Scopus (1232) Google Scholar Vagal stimulation inhibits the production of the cytokine tumor necrosis factor α, probably via the 2 main neurotransmitters of the ANS, acetylcholine and NE. No simple concept explains catecholaminergic influences on immunity. Although across a variety of stressful situations increases in EPI levels are associated with elevations of interleukin 6, bases for this relationship are poorly understood. Immune cells synthesize and release catecholamines,4Lim G.N. Regan S.L. Ross A.E. Subsecond spontaneous catecholamine release in mesenteric lymph node ex vivo.J Neurochem. 2020; 155: 417-429Crossref PubMed Scopus (16) Google Scholar but the functional significance is unknown. In the 1990s Chrousos and Gold proposed the existence of a stress syndrome elicited by activation of the \"central stress system.\" A recently proposed schema1Goldstein D.S. The extended autonomic system, dyshomeostasis, and COVID-19.Clin Auton Res. 2020; 30: 299-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar embeds this system within the \"central autonomic network.\"5Benarroch E.E. The central autonomic network: functional organization, dysfunction, and perspective.Mayo Clin Proc. 1993; 68: 988-1001Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1052) Google Scholar The central autonomic network is the source of outflows to ANS components including the SNS, SAS, and PNS. When the central stress system is activated, PNS outflows generally decrease, which would be expected to promote tachycardia. Other manifestations of PNS inhibition include decreased gastrointestinal motility, decreased salivation and lacrimation, and decreased urinary bladder tone. Acute COVID-19 is associated with several central nervous system abnormalities including stroke, encephalopathy, encephalitis, anosmia, anorexia, headache, nausea, and delirium. A meta-analysis of the literature from previous epidemics (SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome) noted high frequencies of confusion, depressed mood, anxiety, impaired memory, and insomnia.6Rogers J.P. Chesney E.

Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome: clinical presentation, aetiology and management.J Intern Med. 2019; 285: 352-366Crossref PubMed Scopus (169) Google Scholar There are several pathophysiological mechanisms that might be associated with post-COVID POTS. They are not mutually exclusive, and to date there is no published evidence supporting any of them. One mechanism is hypovolemia. Fever, anorexia, nausea, excessive nocturnal sweating, and prolonged bed rest might operate together to decrease blood volume and secondarily increase cardiac SNS outflow. In POTS, deconditioning can be part of a vicious cycle involving low stroke volume, high SNS or SAS outflows, exercise intolerance, and fatigue. These findings have been called \"Grinch heart.\"8Fu Q. Vangundy T.B. Galbreath M.M. et al.Cardiac origins of the postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome.J Am Coll Cardiol. 2010; 55: 2858-2868Crossref PubMed Scopus (236) Google Scholar Second, SARS-CoV-2 might infect and destroy extracardiac postganglionic SNS neurons, secondarily increasing cardiac SNS outflow in a manner analogous to neuropathic POTS. This might include splanchnic venous pooling or a failure of reflexive mesenteric vasoconstriction during orthostasis. Third, SARS-CoV-2 could invade the brainstem and alter functions of medullary centers, resulting in increased central sympathetic outflows in a manner analogous to takotsubo cardiopathy.9Akashi Y.J. Goldstein D.S. Barbaro G. Ueyama T. Takotsubo cardiomyopathy: a new form of acute, reversible heart failure.Circulation. 2008; 118: 2754-2762Crossref PubMed Scopus (659) Google Scholar Centrally mediated increases in sympathetic noradrenergic and SAS outflows as part of stress system activation might be associated with psychiatric morbidity such as anxiety or depression. There could be alterations in brain perfusion manifesting with \"brain fog.\" Fourth is autoimmunity. In response to a viral infection, immune responses targeting the virus are regulated in a complex, dynamic way, balancing attacking the virus vs attacking the host's own cells. There is substantial literature describing autoimmune markers and autoantibodies in POTS; however, there is insufficient evidence of pathogenicity. Considering the survival advantage of molecular mimicry by a virus and the novelty of COVID-19, POTS could result from disruption of this delicate balance—\"dyshomeostasis.\"1Goldstein D.S. The extended autonomic system, dyshomeostasis, and COVID-19.Clin Auton Res. 2020; 30: 299-315Crossref PubMed Scopus (78) Google Scholar The first reported patient with COVID-associated POTS10Miglis M.G. Prieto T. Shaik R. Muppidi S. Sinn D.I. Jaradeh S. A case report of postural tachycardia syndrome after COVID-19.Clin Auton Res. 2020; 30: 449-451Crossref PubMed Scopus (114) Google Scholar awoke with palpitations and shortness of breath on day 7 of her acute illness. On day 22 she noted hyperactivity, pressured speech, and a feeling of inner restlessness and on day 24 episodic \"adrenaline surges\" characterized by diarrhea, tremors, and worsening restlessness. On day 45 she had episodic facial flushing, dermatographia, and nonpruritic hives. She tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 and underwent formal ANS evaluation. The testing confirmed excessive orthostatic tachycardia, normal or even exaggerated increases in blood pressure in late Phase II and Phase IV of the Valsalva maneuver, and large pressure oscillations without hyperventilation during 10 minutes of head-up tilting. Plasma NE with the patient supine was normal at 379 pg/mL and was 310 pg/mL when she was upright (time upright not reported). The workup was insufficient to identify hypovolemia, sympathetic noradrenergic neuropathy, increased SAS outflow, or autoimmunity as pathophysiological mechanisms. Autonomic function testing that applies the EAS concept would include evaluations not only of Langley's ANS but also of the neuroendocrine component (SAS, HPA axis, RAS, and vasopressin) and the neuroimmune component (both humoral and cellular). COVID-19 represents a unique opportunity to understand mechanisms of postinfectious autonomic syndromes involving the circulation. COVID-19 does not only disturb our social rhythmHeart RhythmVol. 18Issue 4PreviewWith 10 vaccines currently approved and another 81 potentially to be approved in the coming months, the focus on the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has changed from confinement to elimination. However, it is a known viral law that when the going gets tough, the tough get going, with natural selection bringing forth the most favorable mutations. Among these, the most worrying were found in South Africa, Brazil, and the United Kingdom, of which the latter initially has been designated as a \"variant of concern.\" Early research shows that mutations in these variants might (partly) escape the immune response.

      "abstract": "In this review we present a pragmatic approach to the patient with chronic vestibular symptoms. Even in the chronic patient a retrospective diagnosis should be attempted, in order to establish how the patient reached the current situation. Simple questions are likely to establish if the chronic dizzy symptoms started as benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), vestibular neuritis, vestibular migraine, Meniere's disease or as a brainstem stroke. Then it is important to establish if the original symptoms are still present, in which case they need to be treated (e.g. repositioning maenouvres for BPPV, migraine prophylaxis) or if you are only dealing with chronic dizzy symptoms. In addition the doctor or physiotherapist needs to establish if the process of central vestibular compensation has been impeded due to additional clinical problems, e.g. visual problems (squints, cataract operation), proprioceptive deficit (neuropathy due to diabetes or alcohol), additional neurological or orthopaedic problems, lack of mobility or confidence, such as fear of falling or psychological disorders. A general neurological examination should also be conducted, amongst other reasons to make sure your patient's `chronic dizziness' is not due to a neurological gait disorder. Treatment of the syndrome of chronic dizziness is multidisciplinary but rehabilitation and simple counselling should be available to all patients. In contrast, vestibular suppressants or tranquilisers should be reduced or, if possible, stopped.",

      "abstract": "Many patients experience difficulty swallowing pills, for I various reasons: * discomfort (particularly pediatric and geriatric patients) * postsurgical need for an alternate route of enteral intake (nasogastric tube, gastrostomy, jejunostomy) * dysphagia due to a neurologic disorder (multiple sclerosis, impaired gag reflex, dementing processes) * odynophagia (pain upon swallowing) due to gastroesophageal reflux or a structural abnormality * a structural abnormality of the head or neck that impairs swallowing. (1) If these difficulties are not addressed, they can interfere with medication adherence. In those instances, using an alternative dosage form or manipulating an available formulation might be required. Crushing guidelines There are limited data on crushed-form products and their impact on efficacy. Therefore, when patients have difficulty taking pills, switching to liquid solution or orally disintegrating forms is recommended. However, most psychotropics are available only as tablets or capsules. Patients can crush their pills immediately before administration for easier intake. The following are some general guidelines for doing so: (2) * Scored tablets typically can be crushed. * Crushing sublingual and buccal tablets can alter their effectiveness. * Crushing sustained-release medications can eliminate the sustained-release action. (3) * Enteric-coated medications should not be crushed, because this can alter drug absorption. * Capsules generally can be opened to administer powdered contents, unless the capsule has time-release properties or an enteric coating. The accompanying Table, organized by drug class, indicates whether a drug can be crushed to a powdered form, which usually is mixed with food or liquid for easier intake. The Table also lists liquid and orally disintegrating forms available, and other routes, including injectable immediate and long-acting formulations. Helping patients find a medication formulation that suits their needs strengthens adherence and the therapeutic relationship.

      "abstract": "A mood disorder is a chronic illness, associated with episodic recurrence over time (1,2); when a patient experiences a new mood episode, explore possible underlying causes of that recurrence. The mnemonic RELAPSE can help you take an informed approach to treatment, instead of making reflexive medication changes (Table, page 54). [R]hythm disturbances. Seasonal changes, shift work, jet lag, and sleep irregularity can induce a mood episode in a vulnerable patient. Failure of a patient's circadian clock to resynchronize itself after such disruption in the dark-light cycle can trigger mood symptoms. [E]nding treatment. Intentional or unintentional non-adherence to a prescribed medication or psychotherapy can trigger a mood episode. Likewise, switching from a brand-name medication to a generic equivalent can induce a new episode because the generic drug might be as much as 20% less bioavailable than the brand formulation. (3) [L]ife change. Some life events, such as divorce or job loss, can be sufficiently overwhelming--despite medical therapy and psychotherapy--to induce a new episode in a vulnerable patient. [A]dditional drugs. Opiates, interferon, steroids, reserpine, and other drugs can be depressogenic; on the other hand, steroids, anticholinergic agents, and antidepressants can induce mania. If another physician, or the patient, adds a medication or supplement that causes an interaction with the patient's current psychotropic prescription, the result might be increased metabolism or clearance of the psychotropic--thus decreasing its efficacy and leading to a new mood episode. [P]hysical health changes. Neurologic conditions (epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, stroke), autoimmune illnesses (eg, lupus), primary sleep disorders (eg, obstructive sleep apnea), and hormone changes (eg, testosterone, estrogen, and thyroid) that can occur over the lifespan of a patient with a mood disorder can trigger a new episode. [S]ubstance use and withdrawal. Chronic use of alcohol and opiates and withdrawal from cocaine and stimulants in a patient with a mood disorder can induce a depressive episode; use of cocaine, stimulants, and caffeine can induce a manic state. [E]nd of drug response. Some patients experience a loss of drug response over time (tachyphylaxis) or a depressive recurrence while taking an antidepressant.

      "title": "MCQ on Neonatology",
      "abstract": "Theme: Neonatology 1. A 25-day term male baby with a birth weight of 3 kg came to the emergency with the mother complaining of vomiting and sudden episodes of bizarre head and neck movements with complete arching of the back lasting for few seconds, mostly during or after feeding, since day 2 of life. His physical, neurological examinations, and electroencephalogram (EEG) were normal. What is the most probable diagnosis? Infantile torticollis Infantile spasm Sandifer syndrome Kernicterus. Answer: C-Sandifer syndrome. Explanation Sandifer syndrome is presented with spasmodic torsional dystonia with arching of the back and rigid opisthotonic posturing, associated with symptomatic gastroesophageal reflux, esophagitis, or hiatal hernia. The stiffening episodes are shown to be temporally associated with food intake and characteristically absent during sleep. Barium swallow study can be done to look for gastroesophageal reflux disease and hiatal hernia. Nonpharmacological measures as the positioning of the head, feeding modifications, and drugs such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) can be given. In case of failure of medical therapy, surgical correction with fundoplication can be done.[1] Although infantile torticollis also presents with dystonia, it has no relation with feeding in particular. In infantile spasm, a form of epilepsy, abnormal movements occur in clusters each lasting 5–10 s most commonly just after a baby wakes up. It is associated with developmental impairment and characteristic EEG changes of hypsarrhythmia. In kernicterus, the baby is icteric with abnormal neurological examination. 2. Gastric juice pH of newborns is: 1.4 2.1 5.0 7.0. Answer: C-7.0. Explanation At birth, due to ingestion of amniotic fluid, which has a neutral pH, irrespective of gestational age (preterm or term), the pH is alkaline and is maintained at 7.05.[2] 3. A 6 days old is being examined, while checking reflexes, a brisk Moro reflex is noted. Which of the following may be a cause? Kernicterus Stage 3 HIE Hypoglycemia Erb’s Palsy. Answer: C-Hypoglycemia. Brisk Moro reflex is usually associated with neonatal hypoglycemia: other rare causes being neonatal withdrawal syndrome, microcephaly, and hydranencephaly.[3] In kernicterus and HIE 3, Moro reflex is absent whereas Erb’s palsy results in asymmetrical Moro with inhibition of the reflex on the affected side. 4. A 4 weeks old exclusively breastfed infant came with complaints of persistent jaundice. On evaluation, the baby is icteric up to legs, alert, afebrile, and gaining weight with total serum bilirubin of 12.8 mg/dL (direct-0.6). Most appropriate management for this child Start phototherapy and stop breastfeeding Reassure mother and continue breastfeeding Perform liver function test and ultrasound of abdomen HIDA scan. Answer: B-reassure mother and continue breast feeding. This is a case of breast milk jaundice. It is a type of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia seen in well-growing term infants which usually begins after the first 3–5 postnatal days, peaks by 2–3 weeks, and gradually resolves by 4–12 weeks. It does not cause kernicterus. It is thought to have a genetic predisposition and/or also related to b-glucuronidase present in breast milk that deconjugates intestinal bilirubin and promotes its absorption. The benefits of breast milk outweigh the risk of hyperbilirubinemia and cessation of breastfeeding is not recommended.[4] 5. Enzyme replacement is done for: Niemann pick’s Gangliosidosis Gaucher’s disease Phenylketonuria. Answer: C–Gaucher’s disease. Explanation Gaucher’s disease is due to an inborn error of metabolism due to enzyme betaglucosidase deficiency leading to failure of degradation of glucocerebrosides. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) balances low levels of glucocerebrosidase (GCase) enzyme with a recombinant enzyme imiglucerase. However, it is effective against Type-I Gaucher’s disease and reverses the hematologic and visceral manifestations. Skeletal disease is slow to respond and pulmonary involvement is relatively resistant. This enzyme breaks down glucocerebroside, the fatty chemical that accumulates in the body of patients with Gaucher’s disease. (This compensates for the missing enzyme, which is why the therapy is called enzyme replacement.). Patients receive ERT through intravenous infusion, which usually takes 1–2 h. The U. S. Food and Drug Administration approved the first ERT in 1991.[5] 6. A term newborn with clear airways[11] [Figure 1], correctly positioned, and heart rate (HR) above 100/min is having labored breathing. Next step in management is:Figure 1: Courtesy: Department of Pediatrics, KIMS, KIIT, DU Start positive pressure ventilation Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) Start chest compression Deep pharyngeal suction. Answer: B-Continuous positive airway pressure. Explanation As per recent NRP guidelines for babies with no apnea/gasping and HR >100/min with labored breathing suctioning of the airways with the attachment of a pulse oximeter is needed. Either oxygen through prong or CPAP can be then administered.[6] Deep pharyngeal suctioning is not advocated as it can damage tissue and stimulate a vagal response leading to apnea and bradycardia. Positive pressure ventilation (PPV) is recommended if after the initial steps, the baby is apneic/gasping or has HR <100/min. Even after the 30s of effective PPV when HR remains below 60/min, it warrants for bag and tube ventilation with chest compression. 7. A full term lower segment cesarean section (LSCS) born, previously healthy, 2-week-old female patient was brought to our outpatient department with bilateral breast enlargement and redness since birth and a history of some clear, nonbloody, and milk-like discharge from both the nipples. There was no history of maternal infections during the pregnancy. The neonate was afebrile with stable vitals. Bilateral breast examination showed a palpable, nontender mass with mild redness of the overlying skin with no nipple discharge. Sepsis screen was negative. What is the most appropriate next step in management? Milking of the enlarged breast Surgical intervention Hormonal estimation in neonate Re-assure parents and observe. Answer: D-Re-assure parents and observe. Neonatal mastauxe[12] is the benign proliferation of glandular tissue of the breast [Figure 2]. The crossing of maternal estrogen across the placenta into the fetal circulation or a normal response to dropping estrogen levels in the maternal circulation towards the end of pregnancy, which may trigger the secretion of prolactin from the neonate’s pituitary gland, is considered the etiological factor. It is asymptomatic or physiological in 60%–90% of cases and can be unilateral or bilateral, more frequently bilateral. It usually presents in the 1st week of life and resolves spontaneously within 6 months of age but may take longer in some babies. Less often, there can be some liquid secretion from an enlarged breast, called the witch’s milk, which may disappear with time without treatment. This nipple discharge can be bloody at times due to mammary duct ectasia. Management mainly involves simple observation and reassurance to the parents as the breast tissue involutes and resolves by its own.[7] As it is a self-limiting condition, hormonal estimation or surgical estimation is usually not done. Milking of the breast can lead to further worsening and hence to be avoided.Figure 2: Courtesy: Department of Pediatrics, KIMS, KIIT, DU8. In C-reactive protein (CRP), the C stands for: Canavallin A Cellular Chondoitin Sulfate C polysaccharide of Streptococcus. Answer: D–C polysaccharide of Streptococcus. Explanation CRP is an acute protein released in the early phase of inflammation against a wide range of acute and chronic inflammatory conditions. CRP binds to phosphocholine expressed on capsular polysaccharide (C-polysaccharide) from Streptococcus pneumoniae. It activates the complement system and increases the release of interleukin-6 and cytokines.[8] 9. A 2-day-old term appropriate for gestational age baby presented with severe respiratory distress and cyanosis. On examination, SpO2 is 60%–70% with wide split S2 and chest X-ray as shown. What is the most probable diagnosis? Obstructed Total anomalous pulmonary venous connection (TAPVC) Ventricular septal defect (VSD) Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) Large atrial septal defect (ASD). Answer: A–Obstructed TAPVC. Explanation Obstructed TAPVC is a surgical emergency that presents in the early neonatal period with severe respiratory distress, cyanosis, pulmonary hypertension, and low cardiac output. Prostaglandin E1 is typically contraindicated in this critical congenital heart defect and immediate surgical repair is needed.[9] VSD and ASD are acyanotic heart diseases which are usually present at 4–6 weeks of life. TOF is a cyanotic congenital heart disease which usually presents in late infancy and has oligemic lung fields in chest X-ray. 10. A newborn term male infant is found to have bruising and petechiae on his limbs on the 4th day of life. He is not dysmorphic and his liver and spleen are not enlarged. The newborn infant is well. His complete blood count shows a hemoglobin level of 15 g/dL, total WBC of 8000/mm3 and platelet count of 5000/mm3. A blood smear confirms a very low platelet count and is otherwise normal. His mother had a history of chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) that required splenectomy when she was a teenager. Her platelet count is 250,000/mm3. What is the likely diagnosis in this case? Neonatal autoimmune thrombocytopenia Neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) Kasabach–Merritt syndrome. Answer: A–Neonatal autoimmune thrombocytopenia. Infants of mothers with ITP who have been splenectomized may have transient neonatal ITP even though the maternal count is normal. This reflects the passage of circulating platelet autoantibodies from the mother to the infant during pregnancy. The platelet count in such infants is often at its lowest level a few days following birth. Infants with neonatal ITP generally respond well to high-dose immunoglobulin-G therapy with or without concomitant corticosteroids. The response to random donor platelets in such a case would likely be poor, and exchange transfusions to remove platelet autoantibodies are an invasive procedure in the newborn.[10] In neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia, there is no maternal history of thrombocytopenia. Kasabach–Merritt syndrome is a rare but life-threatening coagulopathy of infancy which presents with thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and consumptive coagulopathy in the setting of a rapidly enlarging vascular tumor. In DIC, the baby is very sick with uncontrolled bleeding, simultaneous with uncontrolled clotting, set into motion by an inappropriate activation, and consumption of clotting factors resulting in a hemorrhagic state due to inadequate hemostasis.

The DSM-V defines insomnia disorder as one or more of: difficulty initiating sleep, maintaining sleep, or early morning wakening with an inability to fall back asleep. These problems occur despite adequate time allowed for sleep (7 hours), cause dysfunction, and are not attributed to another disorder. The DSM-V then classifies insomnia as either episodic (at least 1 month but less than 3 months), persistent (lasting 3 months or more) and recurrent (2 or more episodes within a year), and considers potential contributing comorbidities. According to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD-3) classification system, symptoms must occur at least 3 times per week, and insomnia is categorized as either short term or chronic. Short-term insomnia disorder in this paradigm (ICSD-3) occurs when the sleep problems have lasted more than 1 but less than 3 months, while chronic insomnia disorder occurs when symptoms persist for more than 3 months.",

      "abstract": "Abstract: Hypothalamic amenorrhea (HA) is a secondary amenorrhea with no evidence of endocrine/systemic causal factors, mainly related to various stressors affecting neuroendocrine control of the reproductive axis. In clinical practice, HA is mainly associated with metabolic, physical, or psychological stress. Stress is the adaptive response of our body through all its homeostatic systems, to external and/or internal stimuli that activate specific and nonspecific physiological pathways. HA occurs generally after severe stressant conditions/situations such as dieting, heavy training, or intense emotional events, all situations that can induce amenorrhea with or without body weight loss and HA is a secondary amenorrhea with a diagnosis of exclusion. In fact, the diagnosis is essentially based on a good anamnestic investigation. It has to be investigated using the clinical history of the patient: occurrence of menarche, menstrual cyclicity, time and modality of amenorrhea, and it has to be exclude any endocrine disease or any metabolic (i.e., diabetes) and systemic disorders. It is necessary to identify any stressant situation induced by loss, family or working problems, weight loss or eating disorders, or physical training or agonist activity. Peculiar, though not specific, endocrine investigations might be proposed but no absolute parameter can be proposed since HA is greatly dependent from individual response to stressors and/or the adaptive response to stress. This article tries to give insights into diagnosis and putative therapeutic strategies.",

It is characterized by self-induced weight loss; various psychological disturbances including distorted body image, fear of obesity, active pursuit of thinness and loss of recognition of a number of body enteroreceptive sensations; and secondary physiological abnormalities. The treatment of AN includes individual psychotherapy, family therapy, and nutritional rehabilitation. Hospital treatment is required when the patient's medical condition is in danger due to hypovolemia or hypotension. If cardiac arrhythmias occur without electrolyte disturbances or if oral therapy fails, nutrition should be repleted by the safest method available. This can be done by nasogastric tube or intravenous hyperalimentation. The management of AN is challenging, because the treatment process and anticipated outcome is in direct conflict with the sufferer's own wishes. A comprehensive treatment plan including both psychiatric and medical approaches is necessary. We report a severe AN case, who has refeeding problems after a three months' hospitalisation period. She was admitted to the child intensive care unit due to deterioration of her vital signs. We tried to solve her problems as a team, and believe that AN has a number of crucial problems thus requiring a multi-faceted treatment approach.",

      "title": "A boy with dissociative symptoms who benefited from biopsychosocial assessment",
      "abstract": "Dissociative disorder is defined in the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) as “a partial or complete loss of the normal integration between memories of the past, awareness of identity and immediate sensations, and control of bodily movements,” and its prevalence in children is as low as 1.30 per 100,000 population.1 We report a case of dissociative disorder secondary to a combination of psychosocial factors in addition to the developmental characteristics of the patient, both of which have been overlooked. A 9-year-old boy suddenly lost consciousness during class one day and received a diagnosis of suspected epilepsy at another hospital. One month later, during another class, he lost consciousness again after experiencing a tremor in his hands. A close examination revealed no abnormality, and the patient was thought to have suspected psychogenic nonepileptic seizures (PNES). Various short-lived involuntary movements with impaired consciousness were often observed and gradually increased in frequency, and odd behavior was observed: When the subject of school or home came up, the child would suddenly become “spaced out,” scratch his face with his hands “like an animal,” and mimic “meow” for several tens of seconds, unable to communicate with staff. The neurologist re-examined the patient for neurological diseases including encephalitis, temporal lobe epilepsy as differential diagnoses. However, various laboratory tests and imaging studies were negative for organic diseases. The fact that positive symptoms appeared only during stress was also suggestive of nonorganic disease. Outpatient treatment was initiated in our department but the patient was admitted to the liaison department for biopsychosocial assessment because of frequent school absences and his mother's increasing fatigue due to difficulties in raising her child at home. During his hospitalization, we conducted a psychosocial assessment by interviewing his mother about his upbringing and developmental history, observing his behavior, and conducting psychological tests. The interviews revealed his rigid thought patterns and sensory sensitivity from early childhood, and the observations of his behavior revealed a lack of nonverbal communication, so we diagnosed him with autism spectrum disorder. The case formulation based on the assessment results is shown in Table 1. In terms of biology, predisposing factors included cognitive bias—the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children®-Fourth Edition (WISC®-IV) at age 7 years: total IQ, 90; verbal comprehension, 119; perceptual reasoning, 76; working memory, 79; processing speed, 86—and developmental characteristics, such as obsessiveness, sensory sensitivity, and poor communication skills. As psychological factors, the initial seizures and loss of consciousness were considered to have been induced by stress with classmates, such as feelings of inferiority. Because both seizures occurred during group work, when he was being helped by group members with a task he was having difficulty with. As a social factor, there was domestic discord between parents and between siblings. The school was also unaware of the cognitive characteristics and did not take them into consideration in his daily life and learning. The stressors that he experienced therefore included changes in learning difficulty and interpersonal relationships due to his promotion to the next grade. As a therapeutic intervention, risperidone was administered as a biological treatment for the irritability in autism spectrum disorder, and psychotherapy was conducted to explain the disease to the parents and the patient, and to encourage the patient to verbalize the disease. As social treatment, we provided parents with disease education and parent training according to their son's developmental characteristics. We also shared information with the school regarding the school's understanding of the child and reasonable accommodation, including symptoms caused by the child's developmental characteristics, necessary environmental adjustments, and involvement in school situations that would encourage verbalization. After explaining the findings to the patient and his family, the dissociative symptoms gradually resolved during the 2-week hospitalization, and the patient was discharged. Fortunately, his relationship with his family has improved, and he has been transferred to a special-needs class. In this case, “personality switching,” “detachment,” “loss of sense of reality,” and “dissociative convulsions” were present as dissociative symptoms. There have been few case reports of children with dissociative disorders secondary to autism spectrum disorders.2 It is possible that the prevalence of dissociative disorders is low and that many cases, such as the present case, go undiagnosed without adequate evaluation of developmental characteristics as background. The psychosocial factors of pediatric patients with PNES are numerous and complex3 and now that biopsychosocial assessment is mandatory. “Consultation liaison psychiatry” that links psychiatry and physical medicine and provides comprehensive medical care to patients is necessary.4 Although the clinical course and symptoms of this case were atypical and difficult to diagnose, a case formulation5 from a biopsychosocial perspective in collaboration with the liaison department and the neurology department clarified each of the complex overlapping factors, leading to the planning and implementation of an effective comprehensive treatment. Further development of pediatric consultation liaison psychiatry to enhance biopsychosocial assessment would be of great benefit. The authors declare no conflict of interest.

Discontinuation symptoms are those that are followed by the suspension or reduction of a medication measure. They are high limitated, reversible by the drug’s reintroduction and they cannot be explained by recurrence of the disruption to which the medication was prescribed. These symptoms do not imply the dependence in medicines. Antidepressants, especially tricyclics, are known for being associated to a group of common symptoms during the discontinuation. These symptoms includes: gastric intestinal disruption and/or general factors(nauseas, vomits, abdominal pain, diarrhea, anorexia, shiverrings, malaise, weakness, tiredness, myalgias, cephalea) initial or avarege insomnia, frequently followed by dreams and/or vivid nightmares pain attacks and delirious abnormal movements(acathisia, Parkinson’s disease). The discontinuation symptoms of ive serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are several, and the most commons are generalized malaise, nauseas, cephalea, lethargy, anxiety, paresthesias, confusion, tremors, sudorese, insomnia, irritability and memory disorders. The objective of this thesis is to effect a revision of the medical literature with regard to the discontinued syndrome of antidepressants, its prevalence and main symptoms. As a result, it was found a large prevalence of discontinuation symptoms, such of TCAs as of SSRIs. Among them, the ones of shorter middle life, such as paroxetine, have more probability to cause discontinuation symptoms. The employed method consists in a survey carried out by MEDLINE in indexed medical magazines. Through this revision, it is conclude that the discontinuation symptoms of antidepressants are frequent and it can lead to a refusal of the medical treatment.

      "abstract": "Any systemic or neurological condition can cause sleep disruption. Diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) in particular may profoundly affect sleep initiation and maintenance by disrupting the structural and neurochemical substrates that regulate sleep. Medical conditions can lead to chronic insomnia in several ways. They may cause unpleasant stimuli, which in turn disrupt sleep continuity. They may produce changes in systemic physiology that are vital to sleep continuity (as with disorders of ventilation), or they may produce humoral changes that favor awakening (as in thyroid or adrenal disease). The incidence of insomnia increases with age as medical problems increasingly occur (1), and patients with chronic insomnia are more likely to develop adverse health outcomes due to medical disease(2). The effects of acute and subacute sleep disruption can lead to psycho-physiological insomnia by creating the anticipation of disturbed sleep and altering circadian rhythms, further accentuating the disruptive effects of the underlying medical condition. Difficulties with insomnia may persist long after the causative medical condition has been effectively managed.",

      "abstract": "Delirium Delirium is a disturbance of consciousness (awareness of the person' s environment) characterized by altered or shifting mental status and inattention (reduced ability to focus, sustain, or shift attention).There are also changes in cognition (basic mental functions) such as memory impairment, disorientation to time or place, and language disturbance.There also may be disturbances of perception (accurate appreciation of the environment) such as hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that are not actually there), abnormal speech, abnormal movements (including tremors or picking at clothing), disruptive or violent behavior, and sudden shifts in emotions.To qualify for a diagnosis of delirium, the signs and symptoms must have a short onset (over a period of hours or days) and change over the course of the day.It is important to make a clear distinction between delirium and dementia (such as Alzheimer disease).Dementia is a disturbance in intellectual (thinking) functions that is usually gradually progressive over a long period.Having delirium along with another medical illness can significantly increase a person' s chance of dying from that illness.It is important for doctors to identify delirium so that it can be treated to improve the person' s overall prognosis.The December 24/31, 2008, issue of JAMA includes an article about agitation and delirium at the end of life.This Patient Page is based on one previously published in the April 14, 2004, issue of JAMA.",

      "title": "185 Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders",
      "abstract": "While gastrointestinal symptoms of abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, bloating, diarrhea, and constipation due to organic causes can be identified by various investigations, functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID), on the other hand, are multi-symptomatic conditions that have no underlying mucosal or structural abnormalities. They are diagnosed based on a collection of symptom complexes. Functional Gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) are quite common in children. The exact cause remains unknown; however, it has usually been referred to as multifactorial. Noninfectious causes affecting the gastrointestinal tract early in life, such as cow’s milk allergy (CMA), can predispose to the development of FGID later in childhood. There are three common concepts for FGID: (1) no known structural cause, (2) no symptoms due to stress disorders, or (3) due to a motility disorder. Although FGID have a great impact on patient morbidity and time off work, some physicians deny or belittle their existence, while other physicians exhibit negative attitude toward such patients. Over the past 2 decades, researchers have started to unravel the underlying mechanisms behind these conditions. For example, impaired gastrointestinal motility and intestinal secretion, along with enhanced visceral sensitivity, have been shown to be key abnormalities associated with the characteristic symptoms of abdominal pain and altered bowel habits as experienced by patients with irritable bowel syndrome. Gastrointestinal motility disorders that are due to altered physiological factors lead to altered physiological function. In recent years, these factors stem from the brain-gut axis interaction and dysfunction. Gastrointestinal motility can be measured and abnormal patterns can be identified using tests for different part of the gastrointestinal tract which provide information to help with diagnosis and treatment. Psychosocial factors, through the brain-gut axis, affect the physiologic function of the gut, which in turn alters motility and sensation, modulating inflammation, which may be caused by or associated with altered bacterial flora.",

Funktionelle gastrointestinale Störungen lassen sich durch eine angemessene organmedizinische Diagnostik und eine ausführliche Anamnese hinreichend verlässlich diagnostizieren. Die Rom-III-Klassifikation liefert eine umfangreiche Beschreibung funktioneller gastrointestinaler Störungen; in der psychosozialen Medizin wird die Diagnose einer somatoformen Störung vergeben. Patienten mit funktionellen gastrointestinalen Beschwerden haben ein erhöhtes Risiko für komorbide psychische Belastungen und Beeinträchtigungen. Patienten im psychosomatischen oder psychiatrischen Versorgungsbereich leiden ebenfalls häufig unter komorbiden funktionellen gastrointestinalen Syndromen. Führen medikamentöse Behandlungsversuche nicht zum Erfolg oder besteht eine psychische Komorbidität, sollte eine psychosomatische oder psychotherapeutische Behandlung initiiert werden. Ebenso kann eine psychopharmakologische Behandlung hilfreich sein. Die therapeutische Interaktion wird oft als anstrengend und frustrierend erlebt. Daher sollte die therapeutische Beziehung aktiv gestaltet werden; eine psychosoziale Perspektive kann schrittweise in die therapeutische Arbeit eingeführt werden.",

      "title": "Lower dyspeptic syndrome. Recommended diagnostic and therapeutic procedures for general practitioners 2006",
      "abstract": "Lower dyspeptic syndrome is a bowel disease manifesting namely with pain or sensation of abdominal discomfort and bowel movement problems (changes in the frequency and stool consistency). Symptoms include sensation of intraabdominal pressure and fullness, diarrhoea (with or without pain), sensation of incomplete defecation, constipation or bowel movement problems (with or without pain), irregular stool, collywobbles and bowel content flow (borborygia with spasms), meteorism, flatulency. Prevalence of the Irritable Bowel Syndrome in the European population is estimated to be 5 to 25 %. In the Czech Republic the total prevalence of dyspepsias is about 13 %. To the pathogenesis of the lower dyspeptic syndrome contribute: 1. abnormal motility, 2. abnormal visceral perception, 3. psychosocial factors, 4. luminal factors, 5. imbalance of neurotransmitters and/or intestinal bacteria and 6. possible inflammatory changes of the intestinal mucosa. Infectious diarrhoea is one of the causes. Functional bowel defects represent various combinations of chronic and recurrent symptoms from the digestive tract which cannot be explained by structural or biochemical abnormalities. Irritable bowel syndrome is a functional defect manifesting with abdominal pain, intestinal dyspepsia and compulsive defecations. Subtypes with typical symptomatology are characterized by circumstances which bring about pain and compulsive defecations (morning fractional defecation, postprandial defecation, debacles). Functional diarrhoea manifests with diarrhoea without intensive pain. Spastic obstipation manifests by abdominal pain, obstipation, compulsive defecations are absent, stool is cloddish, fragmented by spastic haustration, or it has a ribbon-form. Changes in the intestinal chemism include fermentative and putrefactive dyspepsia. Among the incomplete and atypical forms the isolated meteorism, irregular defecation, flatulency, abdominal pain--syndrome of the left or right epigastium or the syndrome of the right hypogastrium can be included. In patients with typical set of symptoms the working diagnose of the lower dyspeptic syndrome can be done by general practitioner. Complete history of the disease can reveal possible extra abdominal cause of dyspepsia, recognise alarming symptoms and consider circumstances elevating or lowering the probability of functional problems. Functional bowel problems have usually long-term character and represent clinically demanding challenge. Only few therapeutic regimens are successful and the therapy aimed at the abolishment of one symptom need not bring general improvement. For the clinical studies of the therapy of functional bowel problems significant placebo effect is typical. Quoad vitam prognosis is good, quoad sanationem it is rather doubtful.",

Disrupted sleep is among the diagnostic criteria for narcolepsy. The complaint of insomnia can also accompany parasomnias, and is listed among the diagnostic criteria for sleep starts and nightmares (1).

      "abstract": "Premature survivors are at increased risk for impaired neurodevelopmental outcome compared to full terms. These sequelae include cognitive abnormalities, mild fine or gross motor delay, cerebral palsy, vision and hearing losses, impairment increases with decreasing gestational age. Persistence of multiple abnormal neurologic signs in the first 12 to 18 months is ominous. Emergence of other findings (vision impairments, seizures, feeding issues delay of head growth) is associated with poor outcome. MRI is useful in predicting neurodevelopmental outcome at the equivalent of term gestation. Other neonatal complications as; bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotizing enterocolitis, retinopathy of prematurity, intraventricular hemorrhage, poor growth, presence of congenital anomalies are associated with an increased risk of poor neurodevelopmental outcome. Premature survivors are more likely to have specific psychological and behavioral problems including attention deficit hyperactivity syndrome, general anxiety, and depression. Individuals with birth weights below 1500 g are at greater risk for poor academic performance than those born with normal birthweight because of their impaired cognition, neurosensory defects, and behavioral and psychological problems. Neurodevelopmental outcome is assessed more accurately at school age than in early childhood due to the cognitive recovery over time and lack of accurate predictive assessment tools in early childhood. Survivors of prematures need to be assessed for neurodevelopmental impairment and, if impairment is present, be referred to educational programs and subspecialty care in order to provide the best possible outcome. ELBW infants without evidence of significant neonatal brain injury can recover when exposed to a nurturing home environment and comprehensive early intervention services.",

      "abstract": "Children with cerebral palsy (CP) frequently grow poorly, compared with their typically-developing peers. Moreover, as children with CP age, their growth diverges further and further from that of typical children. The reasons for poor growth are multi-factorial and include nutritional, hormonal, physical, and neurological causes. Nevertheless, it appears that much of the poor growth is related to acute and chronic malnutrition at various points across the lifespan. The malnutrition is largely due to inefficient and dysfunctional feeding. While remediable to some extent, this dysfunctional feeding often cannot be overcome. Consequently, in children with (usually severe) CP, malnutrition is often treated by bypassing the dysfunctional oral feeding through the use of a gastrostomy.",

      "title": "Practical Recommendations for Hypnotic Switching in Insomnia Management: A Canadian Expert Clinical Framework",
      "abstract": "Insomnia disorder is a complex condition in which patients experience difficulties with sleep initiation, sleep maintenance, or early morning awakening. Chronic insomnia is defined as dissatisfying sleep quality or quantity, occurring at least three times per week, that has persisted for at least three months. Insomnia is common, with a higher incidence in certain subpopulations, including older adults (≥65 years of age) and patients with psychiatric and physical comorbidities, such as depression, anxiety, dementia, restless leg syndrome, obstructive sleep apnea, chronic pain, and alcohol or substance use disorders. Individuals experiencing insomnia often have disrupted sleep architecture, with polysomnography showing reduced time spent in the rejuvenating slow wave and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep stages. As such, insomnia can seriously impair daytime functioning, cognition, and quality of life. Further, insomnia may result in a higher risk of various conditions, including cardiovascular disease, obesity, and diabetes, though the association between insomnia and these comorbidities is likely bi-directional. Unfortunately, for a variety of reasons, the diagnosis is often missed or trivialized in medical practice. Given the profound impact of chronic insomnia, a proactive diagnosis and successful treatment is essential. The primary non-pharmacologic treatment option available for insomnia is cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I), which focuses on sleep hygiene techniques, sleep restriction, circadian rhythm therapy, and cognitive therapy. Although CBT-I is the first-line treatment for insomnia and should always be recommended, it may not always be available in a timely manner, it can be costly and not every patient can afford it, some patients choose to opt out, and may not be sufficient as a single therapy approach. Thus, in many cases, pharmacotherapy may be needed in addition to or instead of CBT-I to treat insomnia and improve daytime functioning and associated cardiovascular and metabolic risks. Of note, patients also often self-medicate with over-the-counter medications, including cannabis products. Currently, commonly prescribed medications for insomnia include benzodiazepine receptor agonists (BZDs; e.g., lorazepam, clonazepam) and Z-drugs (e.g., zolpidem, zopiclone, eszopiclone).10 In addition, despite their risks, antidepressants (e.g., trazodone, mirtazapine), and antipsychotics (e.g., quetiapine) have also been used to treat insomnia despite being off-label and promoting sleep indirectly.",

      "title": "Chronic pelvic pain",
      "abstract": "Chronic Pelvic Pain (CPP) is defined as intermittent or constant pain in the lower abdomen or pelvis of at least six months duration, not occurring exclusively with menstruation or intercourse and not associated with pregnancy1. Chronic Pelvic Pain is a symptom, not a disease, and can result from many different entities. As there is a significant socio-economic impact, it is important to triage, diagnose and manage these patients efficiently and accurately1. Chronic Pelvic Pain is a common ailment affecting up to one in six of the adult female population2,3. Over 10% of all referrals to gynaecologists are for pelvic pain3. The aetiology of chronic pelvic pain is complex and often multifactorial. The most common gynaecological causes of CPP are endometriosis and chronic pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). The non-gynaecological causes include musculoskeletal, urinary and gastrointestinal disorders. Patients with CPP may have sexual, bladder or bowel dysfunction as well as generalised symptoms. The history should include checking for any coexistent anxiety, depression, somatoform disorders and/or drug addiction. There is often a combined psychological and physical contribution to the reduced quality of life4–7. A multidisciplinary approach to this clinical challenge is the best way forward and if the clinical presentation suggests a non-gynaecological component to CPP, referral to the relevant healthcare professional should be organised1,5,6. The management team may include (depending on the symptoms and examination findings) a gastroenterologist, urologist, genitourinary medicine physician, physiotherapist, psychologist, social worker and a psychosexual counsellor1,4. Endometriosis Adhesions (chronic pelvic inflammatory disease/previous pelvic surgery) Uterine fibroids Ovarian cysts/dermoids Pelvic congestion syndrome Adenomyosis Malignancy. Irritable bowel syndrome/diverticular disease Bladder hypersensitivity Nerve entrapment Musculoskeletal basis. This non-invasive diagnostic tool has a significant place in the investigation of patients with chronic pelvic pain. It is commonly used to help identify pelvic masses or cysts and their origin, uterine adenomyosis, prominent pelvic varicosities, and hernias (spigelian hernias). We have reviewed four cases which highlight different presentations of CPP. This was a 26-year-old primiparous woman who presented with a ten-month history of right pelvic pain. She was considering pregnancy in the near future. The pelvic ultrasound revealed a normal sized uterus and right ovary. The left ovary however was expanded by a thin walled cystic structure measuring about 10 mL in volume and filled with homogeneous low-level echoes with minimal peripheral vascularity (see Fig. 1). These are typical ultrasound features of an endometrioma. Homogeneous low-level echoes with minimal peripheral vascularity. The classic unilocular ground glass appearance of an endometrioma results from multiple bleeding episodes and tiny reorganising clots of low/medium echo. The cyst tends to become thick walled over time representing a fibrotic wall containing both new and old blood in the lumen. They are often bilateral. Endometriomas have other less common ultrasonographic presentations. These include a complex cyst with septations containing both solid and cystic components. Nodularity may occur, typically associated with normal impedance blood flow on spectral Doppler interrogation8,9. The cyst can also appear as a haemorrhagic cyst, the latter usually having internal echoes in reticular pattern8.12. The definitive diagnosis of an endometrioma is made on histopathological grounds. Up to 50 per cent of women with endometriosis develop endometriomas. This was a 41-year-old nulliparous woman with past history of symptomatic endometriosis (dyschezia/dyspareunia) involving a rectosigmoid bowel which was adherent to the posterior aspect of the uterus. She subsequently had extensive surgery with bowel re-anastomosis three years prior to presentation. She was medicated (norethisterone) to improve her symptoms, which had improved post operatively but persisted to a milder degree. The pelvic ultrasound findings included hypoechoic structures contiguous with the postero/fundal aspect of the uterus (Figs. 2 and 3) which were distinctly tender to transducer pressure which favoured them to be endometrial deposits rather than fibroids. Postero/fundal aspect of the uterus. Postero/fundal aspect of the uterus. There was also exquisite tenderness to transducer pressure on palpation of both ovaries. Both ovaries and the uterus demonstrated minimal mobility. The findings were suggestive of active disease and periovarian adhesions secondary to the endometriosis and/or surgery. Diffuse endometriosis can be difficult to pick on ultrasound and needs a high index of clinical suspicion to diagnose this condition. There may be tiny deposits along the posterior aspect of the uterus with hypoechoic centers which can mimic the bowel. The former are, however, fixed in position, do not change shape, do not demonstrate acoustic streaming and are usually tender to transducer pressure8,12. The assessment of mobility and tenderness including location of the tenderness is of utmost importance to the diagnosis however may be overlooked11. A retroverted uterus with frozen non-mobile ovaries (Fig. 4) due to pelvic adhesions on transducer palpation are all clues towards the likely diagnosis. A retroverted uterus with frozen non-mobile ovaries. As the bladder fills up with a small amount of urine it is easy to assess bladder wall at the conclusion of a transvaginal study for endometriomas8,12. This was a 50-year-old G6 P4 lady who presented with painful, heavy periods. She had been hormonally medicated to minimise the bleeding. The pelvic ultrasound demonstrated typical features of adenomyosis including the bulky globular uterus with het-erogenous appearance of the myometrium (Fig. 5). There was asymmetrical enlargement of the posterior myometrium with shadowing in Venetian blind pattern (Figs. 5 and 6). The endometrial/myometrial interface was difficult to define. The uterus was generally tender to transducer pressure with increased vascularity (Fig. 7). The myometrium. The myometrium. The uterus was generally tender to transducer pressure with increased vascularity. Adenomyosis is the presence of endometrial glands and stroma within the uterine musculature. Symptoms typically occur in women between 40 and 50 years of age, this pathology is more common among multiparous than in nulliparous women. The ectopic endometrial tissue causes myometrial hypertrophy producing a diffusely enlarged and globular uterus with posterior shadowing in a venetian blind pattern on ultrasound. Tiny intramyometrial cysts may be visible. These ultrasound features have high sensitivity and specificity for adenomyosis although tissue analysis is the diagnostic gold standard7,11. This was a 61-year-old P0 woman who presented with worsening lower abdominal discomfort for six months on a background of active diverticular disease. Pelvic ultrasound demonstrated multiple intramural fibroids. The anterofundal fibroid displaced the endometrium posteriorly. It was difficult to exclude a submucosal component. Two right solid appearing, ovoid, heterogeneous masses were also demonstrated, the larger of which appeared to be attached to the uterine fundus with a broad vascular pedicle (Figs. 8, 9, 10). Right lateral/fundal pedunculated fibroid. Doppler trace of vascular pedicle. Pulse Doppler interrogation of pedicle. The left ovary was separate to the adnexal mass and inferior to it. The findings were suggestive of pedunculated and broad ligament fibroids. This was a patient with gynaecological and non gynaecological aetiologies for her CPP, managed by her GP, gynaecologist and physician. The case also highlighted that unless a clear pedicle is seen arising from the uterus it can be difficult to distinguish between a malignant mass and vascular fibroids in a post-menopausal woman8,10. The patient elected to have a hysterectomy and leiomyomata were confirmed on histopathology. Pelvic venous syndromes are disorders of the pelvic venous circulations, and include vulvovaginal varicosities (VVV) and pelvic congestion syndrome (PCS). They represent a controversial topic of uncertain aetiology compounded by the current lack of definitive diagnostic criteria. Tuboovarian varicoceles are considered the female equivalent of testicular varicocele13–18. VVV occur often in pregnancy and the tendency is for the varices to resolve spontaneously after delivery. They are thought to be secondary to raised venous pressure and venous insufficiency. The patient may have VVV as a separate entity or may have lower limb varices in addition. VVV may also occur as a component of PCS. Pelvic congestion syndrome is typically characterised by chronic pelvic discomfort or pain in women of minimum six months duration, with periovarian varicosities on imaging studies. The CPP or discomfort is usually described as an awareness of unilateral pelvic heaviness or a dull pain worsened premenstrually, or by standing for long periods and/or sexual intercourse. Accordingly, the diagnosis of PCS is based on a history of such symptoms, tenderness on internal examination, and pelvic vein dilatation or incompetence on imaging/laparoscopy. Other causes for these non specific findings need to be excluded15,17,18. It is postulated that hormonal or gravitation/anatomic factors can cause venous insufficiency of the ovarian veins and/or internal iliac veins, leading to periovarian pelvic varicosities. On the other hand, ovarian vein dilatation and reflux on pelvic venography are common findings in asymptomatic multiparous premenopausal women. Ultrasonography is the first line imaging study and is used in the diagnosis of PCS. This is basically to exclude pelvic neoplasms and uterine pathology as potential causes of pain. Dilatation of the left ovarian vein with reversed caudal flow Tortuous and dilated pelvic venous plexuses Polycystic changes of the ovary Dilated arcuate veins crossing the uterine myometrium Variable duplex waveform in varicoceles during the Valsalva manoeuvre17,18,19. Although the lack of pelvic venous changes aids in excluding PCS, the presence of these abnormalities is not diagnostic, as dilated and incompetent ovarian veins are common, nonspecific findings. There is a lack of agreement on the exact cut-off for ovarian vein diameter in PCS, and no validated measure for venous congestion or tortuosity16–18. Sensitivity is higher if the ultrasonographic study is performed with the patient upright/doing valsalva manoeuvres. Even with these procedures the correlation between ultrasound findings and venography for the presence or absence of pelvic varices is poor13,18. In general, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging may offer better detail of tortuous, dilated pelvic and ovarian veins, broad ligament vascular congestion and ovarian varicoceles.",

      "abstract": "Refusal to eat is a common presentation in many psychiatric disorders including obsessive compulsive disorder and schizophrenia. In the acute situation it may be a medical emergency; when it becomes chronic it can become an ingrained behavior that is difficult to change. The diagnosis of individuals who refuse to eat may be difficult, particularly in persons with comorbid medical problems, impaired intelligence, or lack of insight into their condition. Tube-feeding is an effective short-term intervention that can be discontinued when the patient re-starts oral intake. However, in some situations patients may become dependent on the use of tube-feeding. We present a case report of a patient with schizophrenia, obsessive compulsive disorder, borderline intelligence, and seizure disorder who was tube-fed by his family members for more than three years because he refused to eat orally. 在许多精神障碍中（包括强迫症和精神分裂症），拒食是常见的表现。当突然出现拒食时，这可能需要急诊处理；一旦变成慢性，它就成为一种难以改变的根深蒂固的行为。对拒食患者的诊断可能有难度，尤其是对有共病问题、智力受损或对自身状况缺乏自知力的患者。鼻饲是一种有效的短期干预方法，当患者重新进食时即可中止这一干预。然而，在某些情况下，患者可能变得依赖于鼻饲。我们介绍一个病例，报告一名患有精神分裂症、强迫症、边缘智力以及癫痫的患者由于拒绝进食而由其家庭成员用鼻饲管喂食超过三年。.本文全文中文版从2015年10月26日起在http://dx.doi.org/ htp://dx.doi.org/10.11919/j.issn.1002-0829.215013可供免费阅览下载.",

      "title": "Challenges in the treatment of colonic motility disorders",
      "abstract": "The pathophysiology and treatment of colonic motility disorders are reviewed. Colonic dysfunction is a common reason for patients to seek medical care, although patients’ perceptions may not reflect abnormal function. Abnormalities in colonic function can result from a primary disorder of the large intestine or from metabolic, neurologic, collagen vascular, neoplastic, or infectious diseases. Irritable bowel syndrome, a common disorder of colonic motility, can be caused by alterations in colonic neuromuscular functions, afferent neural function, or psychosocial factors. Colonic dysmotility can also result from malabsorption of carbohydrates. The most severe form of altered colonic motility is acute colonic pseudo-obstruction. Diagnostic studies should be limited to tests appropriate for the patient’s symptoms and apparent severity of disease. Most motility disorders are functional disorders and do not result in abnormal studies. Pharmacotherapy should be directed by objective measures, the most useful of which are measurement of whole gut transit time and quantification of the water content of stools. Treatment should be determined by the nature of the disorder and the symptoms involved. For constipation, treatment should begin with changes in diet, fluid and fiber intake, and concurrent medications. Irritant laxatives can have damaging effects and should not be used habitually; however, polyethylene glycol-based purgatives can be helpful. Newer prokinetic agents, such as cisapride, have been shown to promote colonic motility. For selected patients with intractable constipation, surgery has a good success rate. For patients with functional diarrhea, opioid analogues can increase fluid absorption and delay transit.",

      "abstract": "Eating disorders are characterized by a severe disorder in eating behavior. They have been removed from the category of disorders first diagnosed in infancy, childhood and adolescence, where they were included in the previous versions of the DSM-IV (American Pyschiatric Association, 1994), and are now included in a specific diagnostic category. Anorexia nervosa (AN) is characterized by a refusal to mantain the body weight, associated with an extreme fear of becoming fat. Bulimia nervosa (BN) is characterized by repeated episodes of binge eating followed by compensatory behaviors such as self-induced vomiting, or the use of laxatives and diuretics, or excessive exercise. Binge-eating disorder (BED), previously included in the eating disorders not otherwise specified (NOS), has more recently been considered a specific psychiatric diagnosis. It is characterized by uncontrolled binge eating without compensatory behaviors, both in obese and, more rarely, in non-obese individuals. When an eating disorder fails to meet diagnostic criteria for AN, BN, or BED, an eating disorder NOS is diagnosed. Among the clinical situations included in this category are anorexic behavior without amenorrhea or severe weight loss, with the current weight still in the normal range, bulimic behavior, with a low frequency of episodes (fewer than two per week for at least 3 months), and the compensatory behaviors (vomiting, exercise, laxatives) after a small amount of food has been eaten.",

The clinical presentation includes vertigo which is episodic, sensorineural hearing loss which fluctuates, tinnitus and sensation of fullness of ear (aural fullness). Associated complaints includes headache, nausea, drop attacks (otolith crisis of Tumarkin). Meniere’s disease is relapsing in nature which greatly affects patient’s daily activities. The highest prevalent age group is 30-60 years of age. The main pathology occurs as the result of endolymphatic sac distension caused by excessive production or faulty absorption of endolymph or both. The cause is not known clearly. But few factors may contribute in the pathophysiology of Meniere’s disease like excessive retention of water and sodium, allergic reactions, vasomotor disorders, auto immune disorders like rheumatoid fever, middle ear infections etc. Acharya Sushruta has explained Karnarogas like Karnanaada, Karnakshweda, Badhirya which are nearer to Meniere’s disease when studied along with Bhrama. 22 subjects diagnosed with Meniere’s Disease fulfilling the inclusion criteria were selected for the study. Amapachana was done with Shunthi churna. Nasya with Bhringaraja taila followed by Karnapoorana with Bilva Taila and Sarivadi vati along with Dhanwayasa Kashaya and Satwavajaya chikitsa was given.

Dabei ist weiterhin ein abwärtsgerichteter Alterstrend zu verzeichnen, sodass sich beide Erkrankungen in immer früherem Alter manifestieren. Dadurch steigt die Bedeutung dieser beiden Störungen enorm - auch in den Hausarztpraxen. Für eine adäquate Behandlung und zur Verhinderung von Folgeerkrankungen ist eine genaue Diagnostik und differenzialdiagnostische Abklärung notwendig. Dazu gehört auch eine psychosoziale Anamnese, zum Beispiel im Rahmen der psychosomatischen Grundversorgung, wobei hier das ärztliche Gespräch im Mittelpunkt steht. Zu beachten ist, dass bei essgestörten Patienten starke Dissimulations- und Verleugnungstendenzen sowie Motivations- und Complianceprobleme häufig sind. Insbesondere wenn es um die Behandlung der Komorbidität geht, sollte ein fachärztlicher oder psychotherapeutischer Kollege bzw. eine fachärztliche oder psychotherapeutische Kollegin zu Rate gezogen werden. Die Hausärztin bzw. der Hausarzt ist aber meist die erste Anlaufstelle für den Patienten oder dessen Angehörige, sie oder er muss die Probleme erkennen und gegebenenfalls rechtzeitig überweisen.",

      "abstract": "Ayurveda means wisdom or knowledge of life, is the natural holistic system of medicine. The disease Grahani is signified by its nomenclature i.e., incomplete digestion, malabsorption and mal formation of stool. In Ayurveda, Grahani Roga (malabsorption syndrome) is a chronic disease of Annavaha srota (GI tract) vividly explained in our classics. Above the umbilical region Grahani is located, is the seat of Agni (digestive enzyme). Main function of Grahani is to hold undigested food and after digestion it releases the food through the sides of its lumen. But the main cause behind Grahani roga is poor digestive fire and Amadosa (products of impaired digestion and metabolism) as per Caraka Samhita. It is important symptoms are Sukta pakam (fermentation), Muhu baddha muhu dravam (alternate pass of hard and loose stool), Adhman (flatulence), Manasa sadanama (mental frustration) etc. In modern it is correlated to Mal-Absorption Syndrome (MAS). In Grahani Roga the Pittadhara kala fails to recognize the digested and undigested food, often release the undigested food towards small intestine. The insufficient digested food is unable to yield the required Poshak Rasa (plasma) for transformation of Rakta (blood). The person suffers from diminished blood in the system. Hence Grahani patients suffer from Pandu (anaemia). In this present study 60 cases of Grahani roga along with symptoms of Pandu were divided into two groups. Group A (30 patients) were treated with Bhunimba churna. Group B (30 patients) were treated with Pippali churna. The statistical analysis reveals that Bhunimba churna statistically more significant than Pippali churna in the management of Grahani roga and Pandu.",

Pudendal nerve entrapment (PNE) often causes pelvic discomfort in addition to constipation and painful bowel movements. Current literature on ARFID is sparse and focuses on the pediatric and adolescent population. No association between PNE and ARFID has been described. We present a case of ARFID in an adult male with PNE resulting from subsequent scarring from testicular cancer surgery. The patient's gastrointestinal symptoms due to PNE caused significant food avoidance and restriction subsequently leading to severe malnourishment. Clinicians should be aware that distressing gastrointestinal symptoms arising from a secondary disease process such as PNE might lead to dietary restriction and food aversion. More research is needed for proper screening, detection, and treatment of ARFID. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. (Int J Eat Disord 2017; 50:84–87)",

      "abstract": "This case concerns a 16 days old neonate with massive milk aspiration resulting in sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).The syndrome is defined as an unexplained death seen in an apparently healthy baby of less than one year and it usually happens while the baby is sleeping.In past this situation was also recognized as \"aborted crib death\" or \"near miss SIDS\", but in present time these terminologies are not being used.Instead, acute life-threatening event (ALTE) is the terminology used which is defined as \"an episode that is characterized by combination of central or obstructive apnea, colour change (usually cyanosis, but occasionally erythematous or plethoric), marked hypotonia (limpness), choking or gagging\" [1].Although the cause is unknown, it appears that SIDS might be associated with defects in the portion of an infant's brain that controls breathing and arousal from sleep.Besides brain defects, respiratory infection and low birth weight are also the physical factors associated with SIDS.Milk aspiration happens when either food or liquid is inhaled into the lungs.It is commonly observed in babies with weak sucking, choking or chronic coughing while feeding, which often leads to respiratory symptoms.The most common cause is Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), swallowing dysfunction, and neurological dysfunction called cerebral palsy.Aspiration may cause aspiration pneumonia which is an inflammatory condition occur due to irritative gastric contents.",

Food disorders are characterized by different constellations of symptoms, and their onset can be the result of a multitude of personal histories. As with any other childhood disorder, parents' reactions to their children's eating behaviours play a primary role in influencing their future behaviours. Low attunement in parental responses, including, for example, poor structuring of meal times, or providing food that is not age-appropriate, or offering the child's favourite foods as a means to avoid food rejection, serve to reinforce the problems manifested by the child. The mindfulness-based approach is increasingly used in the treatment of a wide variety of pathologies. Mindfulness-based interventions are based on the ability to focus on the present moment, adopting a non-judgemental attitude.",

      "title": "Evaluation of constipation and fecal incontinence",
      "abstract": "Constipation and fecal incontinence (FI) are common worldwide problems and should be considered major public health issues in the pediatric population. Beyond the neonatal period, only in a minority of children, constipation is secondary to a known organic disorder, such as Hirschsprung's disease, anorectal malformations, neurological abnormalities, or an endocrine or metabolic disorder. In over 90% of children with constipation, no obvious organic cause is found and a diagnosis of functional constipation is made. FI is the most common symptom accompanying functional constipation. In less than 15% of children with a functional defecation disorder, FI without any other symptom of constipation is found. According to the Rome III criteria, this is labeled as functional nonretentive fecal incontinence (FNRFI). Functional constipation and FNRFI rarely lead to life-threatening complications but can cause emotional and physical distress and concerns for children and their caregivers, ultimately impairing health-related quality of life. A thorough medical history and complete physical examination in combination with a bowel diary are usually sufficient to rule out most organic causes of constipation and FI. In general, it is not necessary to perform any testing before initiating treatment. Only in atypical cases with warning features or when there is no improvement with conventional therapy, further testing is indicated. This chapter provides an up-to-date review on the role of diagnostic tests in the evaluation of constipation and FI in infants and children.",

      "abstract": "Various clinical situations can influence energy intake and sensing and signalling of satiety. Increased energy intake and diminished satiety signalling can be seen in the case of overweight and obesity. On the other hand, decreased energy intake and increased satiety can be seen in the ageing population, also known as anorexia of ageing. Furthermore, abnormal sensations such as recurring pain, stress, and anxiety can influence energy intake and satiety signalling. This in turn can result in food intake disorders such as avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder. Administering tastants, especially bitter tastants, in the gastrointestinal tract can result in decreased energy intake. Intragastric administration of lidocaine did not result in increased energy intake. A novel tool was developed in order to provide more insight in the disrupted sensing and signalling of satiety seen in the disorder functional dyspepsia.",

Diagnostic procedure for insomnia should include evaluation of sleep–wake behaviour and sleep history, as well as questions about somatic and mental disorders, anamnesis of medication and other substances used, physical examination, sleep questionnaires and sleep diaries, and additional measures. Sleep diaries or actigraphy can be used to evaluate sleep–wake schedules or circadian rhythm disorders. Polysomnography is recommended when other sleep disorders (periodic limb movement disorder, sleep apnea or narcolepsy) are suspected, also for treatment-resistant insomnia. Cognitive behavioural therapy is recommended as the first-line treatment for chronic insomnia in adults of any age. A pharmacological intervention can be offered if cognitive behavioural therapy is not effective or not available. Benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine receptor agonists are effective for short-term treatment of insomnia. Long-term treatment of insomnia with benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine receptor agonists is not recommended. Sedating antidepressants are effective for short-term insomnia treatment. Antihistaminics and antipsychotics are not recommended for insomnia treatment because of insufficient evidence. Melatonin is not recommended for the treatment of insomnia because of low efficacy. Phytotherapeutics are not recommended for the treatment of insomnia because of poor evidence. Light therapy and exercise regimes may be useful as adjunct therapies. Acupuncture, aromatherapy, foot reflexology, homeopathy, meditative movement, moxibustion, and yoga are not recommended for the treatment of insomnia because of poor evidence.",

      "title": "Transtorno Alimentar e Relações familiares: estudo de caso",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCAO. Os disturbios alimentares, mais conhecidos como Anorexia Nervosa e Bulimia, sao caracterizados por uma disfuncao no processo alimenticio do sujeito sendo consideradas duas patologias que podem ter consequencias graves, inclusive a morte. A Anorexia Nervosa atinge ambos os sexos, sendo uma distorcao da imagem corporal que o individuo tem sobre si mesmo, onde apresenta uma perda de peso exacerbada e rapida que pode alterar alguns processos orgânicos. Os pacientes que apresentam esse transtorno alimentar tendem a manter o peso abaixo do esperado para sua faixa etaria e apresentam um grande medo de engordar, mesmo abaixo do peso. O tratamento deste transtorno vem sendo feito com trabalho multidisciplinar, tendo como objetivo principal a recuperacao da saude fisica e psicologica do paciente, levando-o a uma melhora nos quadros fisicos e cognitivos, tendo como consequencia a recuperacao do peso ideal do paciente. Um vies importante para os casos de transtorno alimentar e a relacao com a familia, podendo aparecer sentimentos de culpa, raiva, hostilidade. OBJETIVO . compreender as relacoes familiares em dois casos de transtornos alimentares, especificamente, anorexia nervosa, a partir de uma perspectiva Junguiana. METODO . Trata-se de um estudo de dois casos retirados do livro “Anorexia Nervosa e Bulimia: Ameacas a Autonomia” (HERSCOVICI & BAY, 1997). A analise foi feita segundo a perspectiva Jungiana. RESULTADO E DISCUSSAO . Na primeira analise temos o caso de uma menina de onze anos, inserida em um contexto de conflito familiar em que presenciou uma briga entre seus pais, onde ele foi uma figura agressiva. Ela apresenta um quadro de Anorexia Nervosa severa, tendo um historico de internacao por nove meses com alimentacao parenteral, com isso o animus que internalizado pela menina pode ter sido negativo, tendo dificuldades com o corpo e em se relacionar com o sexo oposto por causa do conflito com o pai. O segundo caso e de uma jovem de vinte anos, orfa de pai e filha mais nova da familia. No seu historico tem episodios de anorexia. E relatada uma idealizacao da mae em relacao ao corpo perfeito das filhas, as levando a tratamentos rigorosos para manter a forma, podendo ser explicada pela teoria de compensacao, onde as energias sao focalizadas em um unico ponto, tornando o corpo um objeto idealizado. Apos anos, ela apresenta grandes variacoes de peso, se internando em clinicas especializadas para perda de peso e seguindo dieta influenciada pela familia, com isso evoluiu para um quadro de bulimia e entao para evitar o ganho de peso e aconselhada pela irma a induzir o vomito, o que, por causa da frequencia, lhe causou danos orgânicos como dores abdominais e sono. CONSIDERACOES FINAIS. Nota-se, a partir dos casos estudados, vemos a importância e influencia que a familia sobre as pacientes e, com a necessidade de tratamento, a familia deve ser inserida no contexto. Criancas que vivem em meio a conflitos familiares ou sao objetos de idealizacao dos pais acabam por nao ter uma transicao para a adolescencia de forma tranquila, podendo descontar suas angustias em seu corpo, na tentativa de ser perfeita, ou para chamar a atencao. O trabalho exposto nos revelou que, para abordar este transtorno, a opcao por tratamentos multidisciplinares tem sido mais eficientes.

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics 3q29 recurrent deletion is characterized by global developmental delay and/or intellectual disability, and commonly, speech delay, and increased risk for neuropsychiatric disorders (including autism spectrum disorder, anxiety disorder, psychosis, and/or schizophrenia). Other common findings are failure to thrive and feeding problems in infancy that persist into childhood, heart defects (especially patent ductus arteriosus), gastrointestinal disorders (including gastroesophageal reflux disease), and dental abnormalities. To date findings in fewer than 50 affected individuals have been reported. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of the 3q29 recurrent deletion is established by detection of the 1.6-Mb heterozygous deletion by chromosomal microarray at the approximate position of chr3:195998129-197623129 in the reference genome (NCBI Build 38). Management Treatment of manifestations: Early speech and language therapy to address speech delays; physical therapy as needed to address fine and gross motor delays; individualized education program (IEP) for school-age children; care by a child psychiatrist/psychologist as needed for neuropsychiatric disorders; feeding therapy and consideration of gastrostomy tube as needed; routine management of dental caries, congenital heart defects, recurrent ear infections. Surveillance: Continued assessment of feeding and nutrition, developmental milestones, cognitive development, and possible neuropsychiatric manifestations. Evaluation of relatives at risk: Parents and older and younger sibs of a proband should be tested for the 3q29 recurrent deletion to encourage close assessment/monitoring of developmental milestones (in children) and monitoring for neuropsychiatric manifestations (in children and adults). Genetic counseling The 3q29 recurrent deletion is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Although most deletions are de novo, inherited deletions have been reported. If the 3q29 recurrent deletion identified in the proband is not identified in one of the parents, the risk to sibs is low (",

      "title": "Gastrointestinal symptoms and autism spectrum disorder: links and risks &amp;ndash; a possible new overlap syndrome",
      "abstract": "Abstract: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a genetically determined neurodevelopmental brain disorder presenting with restricted, repetitive patterns of behaviors, interests, and activities, or persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction. ASD is characterized by many different clinical endophenotypes and is potentially linked with certain comorbidities. According to current recommendations, children with ASD are at risk of having alimentary tract disorders – mainly, they are at a greater risk of general gastrointestinal (GI) concerns, constipation, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. GI symptoms may overlap with ASD core symptoms through different mechanisms. These mechanisms include multilevel pathways in the gut–brain axis contributing to alterations in behavior and cognition. Shared pathogenetic factors and pathophysiological mechanisms possibly linking ASD and GI disturbances, as shown by most recent studies, include intestinal inflammation with or without autoimmunity, immunoglobulin E-mediated and/or cell-mediated GI food allergies as well as gluten-related disorders (celiac disease, wheat allergy, non-celiac gluten sensitivity), visceral hypersensitivity linked with functional abdominal pain, and dysautonomia linked with GI dysmotility and gastroesophageal reflux. Dysregulation of the gut microbiome has also been shown to be involved in modulating GI functions with the ability to affect intestinal permeability, mucosal immune function, and intestinal motility and sensitivity. Metabolic activity of the microbiome and dietary components are currently suspected to be associated with alterations in behavior and cognition also in patients with other neurodegenerative diseases. All the above-listed GI factors may contribute to brain dysfunction and neuroinflammation depending upon an individual patient's genetic vulnerability. Due to a possible clinical endophenotype presenting as comorbidity of ASD and GI disorders, we propose treating this situation as an \"overlap syndrome\". Practical use of the concept of an overlap syndrome of ASD and GI disorders may help in identifying those children with ASD who suffer from an alimentary tract disease. Unexplained worsening of nonverbal behaviors (agitation, anxiety, aggression, self-injury, sleep deprivation) should alert professionals about this possibility. This may shorten the time to diagnosis and treatment commencement, and thereby alleviate both GI and ASD symptoms through reducing pain, stress, or discomfort. Furthermore, this may also protect children against unnecessary dietary experiments and restrictions that have no medical indications. A personalized approach to each patient is necessary. Our understanding of ASDs has come a long way, but further studies and more systematic research are warranted.

      "abstract": "1. Although nighttime awakenings are common in the second half year and beyond, this is not a developmental necessity; rather, most normal infants gain the capacity to \"sleep through the night\" by 6 months of age. 2. There is not a single cause of (or a single treatment for) nighttime awakenings and crying; many factors may be responsible, and these must be identified and individually treated if there is to be resolution. 3. What are often perceived as abnormal awakenings are really only the normal awakenings associated with normal sleep stage cycling, and, parents' \"treatment\" of these awakenings with interventions, such as rocking or feeding, only make it more difficult for the child to go back to sleep without them after subsequent awakenings. 4. No evaluation of a sleepless child is complete without a thorough understanding of the child's daily schedule. The child's sleep schedule may be consistent and his sleep normal, and only the timing may be shifted from that desired by the parents. The bedtime difficulties or early morning awakenings generated in this setting may be handled inappropriately by the family, creating even more complicated problems. Or, the schedule may be irregular, sleep/wake rhythms may not adjust, and any of a variety of apparent sleep disorders may appear.",

      "abstract": "The intronic heterozygous c.1909 + 22G>A POLR3A mutation in combination with a null allele cause adolescent-onset spastic ataxia with action tremor, sensory disturbances, and dental problems [1]. About 59% of published cases present with tremor, mostly of upper limb (72%, see Data S1). Here, we report sustained tremor improvement after deep brain stimulation (DBS) over a five-year-follow-up period in one of these patients included in [1] (Case F3-1). The 71-year-old male, offspring of German non-consanguineous parents, reported progressive gait disturbances since age 15 (wheelchair-bound since age 46), dysarthria, impaired fine motor coordination, restless legs syndrome, and occasionally urinary urge incontinence. At age 60, he developed a progressively disabling action tremor, preventing writing or using a computer and requiring feeding during meals. He presented with pronounced spastic paraplegia, reduced deep tendon reflexes, extensor plantar response, and ankle contractures. Cerebellar signs included saccadic smooth pursuit, hypometric saccades, impaired suppression of the oculocephalic reflex and cerebellar dysarthria. The complex motor phenotype encompassed bilateral upper and lower limb ataxia/dysmetria with an irregular, coarse(3-4 Hz) action tremor with intention tremor-component of the proximal upper limbs, trunk, and head (\"yes\"-tremor). In the Scale for the Assessment and Rating of Ataxia (SARA [2]) he reached 33/40 points. Both legs had distal hypesthesia and diminished vibration sense. Somatosensory and motor-evoked potentials were abnormal. Nerve conduction studies revealed sensory-motor neuropathy (see Supplementary Material). MRI revealed mild generalized, but no specific cerebellar atrophy (Fig. 1D), and bilateral T2-hyperintensities along the superior cerebellar peduncles (SCPs) with a T1-hypointense correlate (Fig. 1A–C), indicating secondary myelin degradation, as described for other patients with hypomorphic POLR3A mutations [1]. Since medication showed no benefit or was contraindicated (see Data S1), the patient underwent DBS of the thalamic ventral intermediate nucleus (VIM) using directional leads (Abbott SJM Infinity, Abbott, Texas, USA). Standard directional monopolar high-frequency stimulation (2A−/C+, 2.8 mA, 60 μs, 150 Hz) was chosen for the left, and omnidirectional modality (10ABC−/C+, 2.4 mA, 60 μs, 130 Hz) for the right VIM. The DBS led to clear improvement (Video S1) relevant to the patient's everyday life: The tremor of the upper limbs, head and trunk were markedly reduced (see Data S1). The patient could again eat independently with a spoon, spread bread with a knife, and use the computer. Adaptation of the stimulation parameters were required over time (left: 3 AC−/C+, 3.8 mA, 90 μs, 160 Hz; right: 11 BC−/C+, 3.5 mA, 60 μs, 150 Hz; Fig. 1E–G), but the DBS-benefit still persisted at a five-year-follow-up, also reflected in the SARA [2] (DBS-OFF/ON 38 vs. 34.5/40 points), and the Essential Tremor Rating Assessment Scale ([3], DBS-OFF/ON: 96 vs. 80.5/99.5 points). This benefit is remarkable since the T2-hyperintense SCPs belong to the dentato-rubro thalamic-tract, important for tremor control by VIM-DBS [4]. However, the cause of tremor in POLR3A patients appears complex, as not all patients with SCP-T2-hyperintensity present with tremor [1]. Thus, the functional impact of the T2-hyperintense (demyelinated) SCPs for the dentato-rubro-thalamic-tract and its role in the occurrence of tremor in these patients is unclear and requires further investigations. DBS in patients suffering from POLR3A-related disorders has currently only been described for one adult patient with cognitive decline and parkinsonism, successfully treated with pallidal DBS [5]. Due to the profound and long-lasting benefit relevant to everyday life our case illustrates, that patients with action tremor due to POLR3A mutations should be considered suitable candidates for DBS.

A differentiation is made between neuroglucopenic symptoms (e.g., confusion, somnolence) on the one hand, and those that arise as a result of the counterregulatory response of the sympathetic nervous system (e.g., tremor, sweating), on the other. The diagnosis of hypoglycemia can cause considerable problems, in particular when only isolated single symptoms present (e.g., confusion, psychosis, seizures, coma). For the elective clarification of recurrent hypoglycemia, further diagnostic examinations (e.g., fasting with determination of hormones, measurement of insulin) are employed in addition to the patient's history. For differential diagnostic considerations not only organic causes, but also adverse drug reactions and a factitious genesis must be excluded. In the event of an emergency (e.g., hypoglycemic coma) the usual form of treatment is the administration of glucoses or glucagon.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Objective Medical problems that arise due to severe restricting and/or purging may be misdiagnosed or suboptimally treated, from outpatient clinics to top medical hospitals. A symptom may be presumed to be a psychological manifestation of the eating disorder and inappropriately dismissed for further medical evaluation. Alternatively, a detailed medical workup may be performed, overlooking a classic relationship between starvation and a physical finding, which delays referral to eating disorder care. This review article focuses on rare medical issues (also called “zebras” in medical training), diagnoses that may be missed in patients with eating disorders, and best practices for management, organized by organ system. Method A PubMed search was performed, using search terms “eating disorder,” “anorexia nervosa,” and “bulimia nervosa” in combination with different words for each organ system and known medical manifestations of severe eating disorders, with high quality and relevant studies from the past 20 years cited. Discussion Adults with eating disorders may present with extreme organ dysfunction and atypical signs and symptoms of typical medical problems. Timely diagnosis, risk awareness, appropriate treatment, and avoidance of harm are all vital. With judicious management and nutritional rehabilitation, most of these complications will significantly improve or resolve. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. (Int J Eat Disord 2016; 49:331–344).",

      "abstract": "The formulation of a diagnosis in a child who has neurologic impairment should not (except in extreme circumstances) be made on the basis of a single finding. For example, the presence of delayed milestones, primitive or exaggerated reflexes, abnormal muscle tone, abnormal posture, abnormal neurologic examination, and temporal course should all be used to make the diagnosis of cerebral palsy. Furthermore, because each condition has a spectrum of disabilities from mild to severe involvement, determination of the child's abilities and impairments should be part of the diagnostic process. Because the child lives in a number of different environments, assessment of the child's functional abilities and evaluation of the environments should be made. Finally, evaluations by specialists in physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, psychology, special education, and nutrition may be necessary to complete the child's diagnosis. The ability to examine the child over a period of time (i.e., continuity of care) allows the practitioner to provide a more accurate prognosis for future development. It also enables easier diagnosis of the child when he or she is acutely ill. This also allows a more trusting relationship to develop with the parent and enhances the ability to influence the psychosocial conditions that affect outcomes. Finally, all these children should have care coordination (case management) (i.e., someone who can ensure that they receive the care they need, without duplication) across all settings, including home, school, hospitals, and ambulatory facilities.",

Bowel dysfunction, faecal incontinence, and constipation have a prevalence of around 70% in people with central neurological disease such as Parkinson’s disease, stroke, multiple sclerosis, or spinal cord injury. Tools such as the Bristol Stool Chart have been developed to aid conversation about bowel dysfunction (fig 1). Constipation may lead to difficult evacuation, abdominal pain and bloating, haemorrhoids, anal fissures, rectal bleeding, prolapse, and autonomic dysreflexia. Hospital admission for impaction occurs more than twice as frequently as in healthy people. Management to ameliorate either incontinence or constipation risks precipitating the other.

      "abstract": "This is the first attempt at defining criteria for functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) in infancy, childhood, and adolescence. The decision-making process was as for adults and consisted of arriving at consensus, based on clinical experience. This paper is intended to be a quick reference. The classification system selected differs from the one used in the adult population in that it is organized according to main complaints instead of being organ-targeted. Because the child is still developing, some disorders such as toddler's diarrhea (or functional diarrhea) are linked to certain physiologic stages; others may result from behavioral responses to sphincter function acquisition such as fecal retention; others will only be recognizable after the child is cognitively mature enough to report the symptoms (e.g., dyspepsia). Infant regurgitation, rumination, and cyclic vomiting constitute the vomiting disorders. Abdominal pain disorders are classified as: functional dyspepsia, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), functional abdominal pain, abdominal migraine, and aerophagia. Disorders of defecation include: infant dyschezia, functional constipation, functional fecal retention, and functional non-retentive fecal soiling. Some disorders, such as IBS and dyspepsia and functional abdominal pain, are exact replications of the adult criteria because there are enough data to confirm that they represent specific and similar disorders in pediatrics. Other disorders not included in the pediatric classification, such as functional biliary disorders, do occur in children; however, existing data are insufficient to warrant including them at the present time. For these disorders, it is suggested that, for the time being, clinicians refer to the criteria established for the adult population.",

Dalam istilah medis enuresis adalah istilah untuk anak yang mengompol minimal dua kali dalam seminggu dalam periode paling sedikit 3 bulan pada anak usia 5 tahun atau lebih, yang tidak disebabkan oleh efek obat-obatan. Dari beberapa penelitian didapatkan kondisi enuresis terjadi pada usia 5 tahun, pada usia tersebut didapatkan angka enuresis sekitar 10-15% dimana anak masih mengompol paling tidak satu kali dalam seminggu. Kondisi enuresis pada anak tersebut dapat dipengaruhi oleh beberapa faktor diantaranya peningkatan volume urin, ketidakmampuan untuk bangun dan menahan berkemih saat kandung kemih penuh. Kondisi Enuresis dapat memberikan dampak terhadap perkembangan anak secara fisik maupun psikis, diantaranya akibat dari enuresis ini anak akan mengalami gangguan perilaku baik dari sisi internal ataupun eksternal. Adapun penanganan kondisi enuresis didasarkan pada 4 prinsip diantaranya adalah peningkatan motivasi dari anak, pengaturan perilaku dari anak, penggunaan enuresis alarm, dan farmakoterapi jika semua kondisi non farmakoterapi sudah dilakukan.

Delirium with pronounced psychomotor and sympathetic hyperactivity is more often seen in younger patients with alcohol or substance intoxication/withdrawal (delirium tremens), but no cause is specific to a clinical subtype. Delirium is distinguished from dementia (with which it may coexist, as dementia is a major risk factor for delirium) by its speed of onset (over hours or days) and reversibility with correction of the underlying cause.

Often they seem to peter out or, at least, the family becomes able to cope with the symptom at a domestic level, once the doctor has guessed or established the family’s specific fear, and has been able to reassure them that the pains are not, for example, appendicitis, leukaemia or a brain tumour. Other family members may have dysmenorrhoea, indigestion, or migraine. The abdomen and head and limbs seem to be the most common sites for recurrent pains in children; chest pains or chronic backache are rarer. Although, in most patients, there is no physical cause to account for the pain, careful assessment is necessary. Chronic backache, unlike the others, is more usually a symptom of some underlying organic pathology in a child. It, and limb pains are discussed in Chapter 21.",

      "title": "Sleep and the Athlete",
      "abstract": "Adequate sleep hygiene is increasingly recognized as a crucial part of athlete recovery, avoidance of overtraining or burnout, and optimization of health. Sleep impacts metabolic regulation and homeostasis and serves a vital restorative function (1). Sleep regulation occurs through an intrinsic sleep-wake cycle of optimal duration, coupled with a circadian rhythm that is influenced by environmental exposures, such as light and darkness. Other factors that affect sleep include exercise, diet/nutrition, supplements/stimulants, medications, travel, social/electronic media, and mental/physical health (2–4). In general, exercise favorably affects sleep quality and quantity (5). High-performance athletes, particularly adolescent and young adult athletes, are routinely exposed to greater physical, psychological, and neuromuscular stressors that require a delicate balance of recovery, including appropriate sleep (5). Athletes are at higher risk for sleep impairment for several reasons. Sleep deprivation is the most common sleep disorder, in general (6,7), and the frequency of both early morning and/or evening training sessions can decrease sleep duration, resulting in acute and cumulative sleep deprivation. A minimum of 7 h of sleep per day is ideal for optimal health in adults; adolescents require a minimum of 8 h of sleep per day (6,7) (Table). Traveling across time zones for competitions can have negative effects on circadian rhythms, particularly west to east travel. In general, it is prudent to allow at least 1 d for each time zone crossed for full resolution of jet lag symptoms (8,9). Additional studies have shown that between 50% and 80% of all athletes experience poor sleep quality during periods of heavy training and particularly on the nights before and after competition (5,10–12). Poor sleep quality and quantity can negatively affect cognitive and physical performance, perceived exertion, injury risk, and mental health (2–4). All of the above, along with increased pain, decreased task execution tolerance, and decreased cognitive and motor function (e.g., increased reaction times), are consistently correlated with increased injury risk in athletes (13–16). Daytime restorative napping, a common strategy that can reduce sleep debt, can improve short-term memory, alertness, and accuracy during reaction-time tests and should be incorporated, when necessary. Other sleep hygiene recommendations include maintaining consistent bedtimes, avoiding evening light exposure from technology and electronic devices, limiting caffeine intake, maintaining adequate hydration, and having a relaxation-focused bedtime routine (17,18).Table: National Sleep Foundation Sleep Duration Recommendations byAge (23).Athletes with mental health disorders and sport-related concussion (SRC) often display symptoms of disordered sleep. Sleep disturbance is a common complaint in concussed athletes with up to 50% reporting sleep-related issues, including insomnia, difficulty falling asleep, and impaired sleep quality. Sleep disturbance may hinder concussion recovery and can worsen psychiatric illness, memory, and social functioning (19). Unfortunately, inadequate sleep the night before neurocognitive concussion testing can lead to increased symptom scores, impeding return to play (20). Sleep quality and mental health impact each other (21). Sleep impairment can lead to increased stress, negative mood, and exacerbation of mental illnesses, such as anxiety or depression. Conversely, the presence of mental illness can cause sleep disturbances. Optimizing sleep appears to improve overall mental health (21,22). Compensatory strategies, restorative approaches, and cognitive rehabilitation should be incorporated into comprehensive treatment plans for SRC patients and athletes with mental health disorders. Good sleep hygiene that includes adequate sleep duration, quality, and timing appears to be a crucial factor in athlete health, performance, adaptation, recovery, and injury prevention. Athletes must increase their awareness of sleep importance and develop strategies to maintain proper sleep regulation throughout training and competition.",

In addition, among the life event categories assessed, insomniacs reported a greater number of undesirable events, particularly events related to losses and to ill health. They also had lifelong histories of more illnesses and somatic complaints, beginning with more childhood illnesses and more childhood problems related to eating and sleeping. During childhood, insomniacs reported more frequent discontent with their families, and prior to the onset of insomnia, they had less satisfying relationships with their parents as well as problems in other interpersonal relations and in their self-concepts. Currently, insomniacs felt considerably less satisfied with their lives, had lower self-concepts, and had greater difficulty with interpersonal relationships. Thus, stressful life events, mediated by certain predisposing factors of personal vulnerability, were found to be closely related to the onset of chronic insomnia.",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics PAFAH1B1-related lissencephaly/subcortical band heterotopia (SBH) comprises a spectrum of severity. Affected newborns typically have mild-to-moderate hypotonia, feeding difficulties, and poor head control. During the first years, neurologic examination typically demonstrates poor visual tracking and response to sounds, axial hypotonia, and mild distal spasticity that can transition over time to more severe spasticity. Seizures occur in more than 90% of individuals with lissencephaly and often include infantile spasms. Seizures are often drug resistant, but even with good seizure control, the best developmental level achieved (excluding the few individuals with partial lissencephaly) is the equivalent of about age three to five months. In individuals with PAFAH1B1-related SBH, developmental delay ranges from mild to severe. Other findings in PAFAH1B1-related lissencephaly/SBH include feeding issues and aspiration (which may result in need for gastrostomy tube placement), progressive microcephaly, and occasional developmental regression. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of PAFAH1B1-related lissencephaly/SBH is established in a proband with a heterozygous pathogenic variant in PAFAH1B1 identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Standard treatment with antiepileptic drugs based on the specific seizure type and frequency; polytherapy with valproic acid and lamotrigine appears most effective in reducing drug-resistant seizures; placement of a gastrostomy tube for those with failure to thrive, dysphagia, and/or recurrent aspiration pneumonia; treatment with stool softeners, prokinetics, osmotic agents, or laxatives for constipation; standard treatment for developmental delay/intellectual disability, spasticity, visual impairment, and hearing loss. Surveillance: At each visit: measure growth parameters and evaluate nutrition status and safety of oral intake; monitor for signs and symptoms of constipation, aspiration, and respiratory insufficiency; monitor those with seizures as clinically indicated; assess for new manifestations, such as unusual spells or developmental regression; assessment of developmental progress and educational needs; assessment of mobility and self-help skills. Annually or as clinically indicated: ophthalmologic and audiologic evaluations. Genetic counseling Individuals diagnosed with isolated PAFAH1B1-related lissencephaly/SBH typically have the disorder as the result of a de novo genetic alteration (an intragenic PAFAH1B1 pathogenic variant or, rarely, a chromosome rearrangement that disrupts PAFAH1B1). In rare families, an individual with PAFAH1B1-related lissencephaly/SBH has the disorder as the result of autosomal dominant inheritance of a PAFAH1B1 pathogenic variant from a parent. If the intragenic PAFAH1B1 pathogenic variant identified in the proband is not identified in either parent, the recurrence risk for a future pregnancy is slightly greater than that of the general population because of the possibility of parental germline mosaicism. If a parent of a proband is known to have the intragenic PAFAH1B1 pathogenic variant or a balanced translocation that disrupts PAFAH1B1, the recurrence risk is 50% with each future pregnancy. Once the causative genetic alteration has been identified in the proband, prenatal testing may be offered to parents of an affected child because of the recurrence risk associated with the possibility of parental mosaicism or a balanced chromosome rearrangement.",

      "abstract": "Summary An disorder is marked by extremes. It is present when a person experiences severe disturbances in behavior, such as extreme reduction of food intake or extreme overeating, or feelings of extreme distress or concern about body weight or shape. A person with an disorder may have started out just smaller or larger amounts of food than usual, but at some point, the urge to eat less or more spirals out of control. Eating disorders are very complex, and despite scientific research to understand them, the biological, behavioral and social underpinnings of these illnesses remain elusive. The two main types of disorders are anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa. A third category is eating disorders not otherwise specified (EDNOS), which includes several variations of disorders. Eating disorders frequently appear during adolescence or young adulthood, but some reports indicate that they can develop during childhood or later in adulthood. Women and girls are much more likely than males to develop an disorder. Men and boys account for an estimated 5 to 15 percent of patients with anorexia or bulimia and an estimated 35 percent of those with binge-eating disorder. Eating disorders are real, treatable medical illnesses with complex underlying psychological and biological causes. They frequently co-exit with other psychiatric disorders such as depression, substance abuse, or anxiety disorders. People with disorders also can suffer from numerous other physical health complications, such as heart conditions or kidney failure, which can lead to death.",

Symptoms must have persisted for at least 1 year, although they could wax and wane in frequency, and onset of symptoms must be prior to age 18. It is very important to distinguish interference due to tics from distress due to other comorbid problems such as Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) or Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). If only motor tics or vocal tics are present and they occurred many times a day, for less than 1 year, the interviewer should consider a diagnosis of Provisional Tic Disorder.",

      "abstract": "Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is a gastrointestinal condition marked by irregular bowel movements and abdominal discomfort, with no identifiable structural abnormalities. The exact cause of IBS remains unclear, though it is believed that factors such as abnormal gut motility and sensory functions, central nervous system disturbances, psychological issues, stress, and luminal influences may contribute. Approximately 10-15% of the population experiences IBS at some point, yet only about 10% seek medical attention for their symptoms. In Ayurveda, IBS can be linked to Grahani Roga due to the similarities in their clinical manifestations. In this case, an effort was made to treat a 48-year-old male patient presenting with symptoms of muhurbaddha muhurdravama (alternating constipation and diarrhoea), apakwa malapravritti (mucous in the stool), udar gaurava (abdominal heaviness), and amlakatuudgara (sour and bitter belching). The patient was treated with various shamana aushadhi (pacifying oral medications). After 42 days of treatment, the patient showed significant improvement. The episodes of muhurbaddha muhurdravama (alternating constipation and diarrhoea) and mucus in the stool decreased from grade 3 to grade 0, reflecting a 100% improvement. The condition of udargaurava (abdominal distension) improved from grade 3 to grade 1, indicating an 80% reduction in severity. The symptom of loss of appetite dropped from grade 2 to grade 0, showing a complete recovery. These results highlight the substantial progress the patient made during the treatment.",

      "abstract": "Constipation is a frequent complaint among patients with different neurological diseases. This review provides a brief account of the numerous conditions affecting the central, peripheral and intrinsic (enteric) nervous systems in which constipation can be the only clinical manifestation or a component of a complex syndrome. Recent neuropathophysiological acquisitions show that any structural or functional impairment of the intrinsic innervation of the gut, including both developmental (i.e., Hirschsprung's disease and intestinal neuronal dysplasia) and acquired (i.e., either degenerative or inflammatory neuropathies) disorders, can be associated with constipation. Constipation may also arise from derangements of the peripheral nervous system, including diabetes and primary chronic autonomic failure (pandysautonomias). Finally, in the central nervous system, a wide array of disorders (post-traumatic, degenerative, ischaemic or neoplastic) are recognized to determine bowel dysfunction, ultimately leading to constipation. Further understanding of the fine pathophysiological mechanisms through which the intrinsic and extrinsic nerve supplies to the digestive system are involved in idiopathic constipation or in diseases generating this symptom will hopefully lead to a better treatment of this frequent pathological condition.",

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title> Background: Reflex epilepsies are characterized by seizures triggered by specific stimuli such as light, stress, or eating. Recent research suggests a continuum between reflex and spontaneous seizures. Eating epilepsy, where eating triggers seizures, is a complex condition often seen in individuals with other types of epilepsy. This case report is novel as it describes transient epileptic amnesia (TEA) induced by eating, a previously unreported phenomenon. This report adds to the sparse literature on reflex eating epilepsy and TEA by detailing the patient’s seizure semiology and electroencephalographic findings. Case Presentation: A 25-year-old left-handed female with a family history of epilepsy began experiencing seizures in January 2023. Her seizures, mostly triggered by eating, are preceded by a change in taste and an indescribable aura. During seizures, she becomes forgetful and confused, giving inappropriate responses without losing consciousness or showing motor manifestations. The seizures, lasting less than a minute, occur weekly despite treatment with levetiracetam and lamotrigine. Her brain MRI was normal, and a routine EEG showed frequent left temporal sharp waves without ictal events. During an EMU admission, interictal EEG showed frequent sharp waves over the left temporal region. She had four clinical seizures with left temporal onset, all provoked by eating. She experienced parageusia at seizure onset, followed by an inability to name food or objects, but could speak and follow commands, excluding ictal aphasia. Postictally, she recalled all events. All seizures were recorded off antiseizure medications. Conclusions This case highlights the novel presentation of TEA induced by eating, expanding the understanding of reflex epilepsies. The detailed seizure semiology and EEG findings contribute to the sparse literature on this condition, emphasizing the need for further research into the mechanisms and management of reflex eating epilepsy and TEA.",

Bulimia nervosa (BN) is an eating disorder manifested by binge eating attacks followed by recurrent inappropriate compensatory behaviours, such as self-induced vomiting and excessive exercise. Dysphagia, regurgitation, vomiting, retrosternal pain, heartburn, weight loss, avoidance of eating, consumption of large amount of liquids and aberrant eating behaviours are symptoms of both achalasia and BN. Owing to these common signs and symptoms, oesophageal achalasia can be misdiagnosed as an eating disorder. In addition, oesophageal achalasia can occur as a complication of BN. It is often difficult to distinguish organic and psychological vomiting or comorbidity because of overlapping of the symptoms.Case report: We report the case of a patient who developed oesophageal achalasia following severe, repetitive vomiting as a complication of BN.Conclusion: We want to raise awareness regarding the development of a medical illness in the presence of a psychiatric disorder. Importantly, physicians should have a fundamental knowledge of these two diseases regarding their clinical patterns to differentially diagnose one or both disorders as quickly as possible.",

      "abstract": "Bipolar disorder is an episodic, potentially life-long, disabling disorder that can be difficult to diagnose. Need to improve recognition, reduce sub-optimal care and improve long-term outcomes. There is variation in management of care across healthcare settings. Characteristics of a Manic Episode: A distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive or irritable mood. During the period of mood disturbance, at least three of the following symptoms have persisted (four if the mood is only irritable) and have been persistent to a significant degree.1. Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity. 2. Decreased need for sleep. 3. More talkative than usual or pressure to keep talking. 4. Flight of ideas or subjective experience that thoughts are racing. 5. Distractability, i.e. attention too easily drawn to unimportant or irrelevant external stimuli. 6. Increase in goal-directed activity or psychomotor agitation. 7. Excessive involvement in pleasurable activities which have a high potential for painful consequences, e.g. unrestrained buying sprees, sexual indiscretions, or foolish business investments. Mood disturbance sufficiently severe to cause marked impairment in occupational functioning or in usual social activities or relations with others, or to necessitate hospitalization to prevent harm to self or others. At no time during the disturbance have there been delusions or hallucinations for as long as two weeks in the absence of prominent mood symptoms. Not superimposed on schizophrenia, schizophrenic form disorder, or delusional disorder or psychotic disorder. The disturbance is not due to the physiologic effects of a substance or general medical disorder.",

      "abstract": "Disgust with ‘fatness' and a consequent preoccupation with body weight, coupled with an inability to reduce it to or sustain it at the desired low level, characterizes the abnormal normal weight control syndrome. Individuals remain sexually active in a biological sense and often also socially. Indeed their sexual behaviour may be as impulse ridden as is their eating behaviour, which often comprises phases of massive bingeing coupled with vomiting and/or purgation. The syndrome is unlike frank anorexia nervosa in that the latter involves a regression to a position of phobic avoidance of normal body weight and consequent low body weight control with inhibition of both biological and social sexual activity. In abnormal normal weight control there is a strong and sometimes desperate hedonistic and extrovert element that will often not be denied so long as body weight does not get too low. Individuals nevertheless feel desperately ‘out of control’ and insecure beneath their bravura. The syndrome is much more common in females than in males. There is a clinical overlap with anorexia nervosa and obesity in many cases as the disorder evolves. Depression, stealing, drug dependence (including alcohol) and acute self-poisoning and self-mutilation are common complications. Clinic cases probably only represent the tip of the iceberg of a much more widespread morbidity within the general population. Like anorexia nervosa and for the same reasons the disorder is probably more common than it used to be.",

Urgent assessment is required to identify and, where possible, correct the pathological cause, and protect the brain from the development of irreversible damage. Specific treatment (if any) will depend upon the particular cause of coma, but—whatever the cause—long-term attention is required to the patient’s respiration, skin, circulation, and bladder and bowel function, seizures must be controlled, and the level of consciousness should be regularly assessed and monitored.",

Additional predisposing factors should be noted. Eating disorders are often accompanied by specific psychic and somatic symptoms in terms of comorbidity.

      "abstract": "Since the late 1800s there are reports of post-traumatic anosmia [1], but few studies investigated post-traumatic gustatory deficit and adopted validated evaluation tests [2,3,4,5,6,7]. Post-traumatic ageusia is rare, occurring in ~ 0.5% of head traumas, while a gustatory deficit is more frequently referred (5-7%) when olfaction is impaired [2,4]. Unlike olfaction, gustatory sensation is mediated by several cranial nerves (VII, IX, X) and taste receptors are widely spread in the oral cavity, so that taste is considered a “robust” sense. Peripheral and/or central mechanisms may be involved in the genesis of post-traumatic gustatory dysfunction. Beyond a reduction/loss of gustatory function following a trauma, taste changes (dysgeusia) may occur, even if they are reported to be rare [7,8,9]. Gustatory disorders might not be immediately reported because patient often pays attention to other post-traumatic sequelae. Especially when persistent, taste deficits might be particularly relevant for patients’ quality of life. Physicians are often not well-informed on the possible implications or treatment strategies. Fifty-three consecutive patients with previous head trauma and chemosensory disorders were recruited by the olfactory and taste research group of the University of Verona. Every patient underwent a careful clinical examination, olfactory and gustatory testing by Sniffin’Sticks Extended test, Whole Mouth taste test and Taste Strips Test respectively (Burghart, Germany). Among them, we found 10 cases with hyposmia, 43 with functional anosmia, while 10 cases showed taste deficits (dysgeusia: n = 3, dysgeusia with hypogeusia: n = 1, hypogeusia: n = 5, ageusia: n = 1). Here we report anatomical, clinical correlations and detailed description of three cases representing central and peripheral injury patterns.",

      "abstract": "The esophageal primary motor disorders like achalasia, diffuse esophageal spasm or the nutcracker can involve the upper esophageal sphincter, the esophageal body, the lower esophageal sphincter or a combination of them. This article will focus on the esophageal body and abnormal peristalsis. A normal esophageal peristaltic contraction occurs after a latency period following a swallow and requires a minimum amplitude to be propulsive. Abnormal latencies may generate simultaneous contractions whereas low amplitude contractions may be inefficient i.e. GERD and high amplitude contractions my provoke chest pain or dysfagia i.e. diffuse spasm. The latency period between deglutition and contraction is due to a muscle inhibition immediately after the swallow. This inhibition is due to release of NO by an inhibitory neurone located in the myenteric plexus. At the end of the inhibition, the contraction occurs due to release of acetyl choline by an excitatory cholinergic neurone. The exact interplay between these two neurones will determine the <<timing>> or propagation velocity and the amplitude of esophageal contractions. Patients with achalasia have a predominant loss of inhibitory neurones (VIP and NOS) with a relative preservation of excitatory cholinergic neurones. The histophatologic and immunohistochemical status in patients with esophageal primary motor disorders other than achalasia is poorly characterised Examples of deglutitive inhibition in the esophagus can be observed during the relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter or when a subject swallows very frequently. In order to quantify deglutitive inhibition we developed a method that induces an artificial high pressure zone in the mid esophageal body. During the latency period after a swallow, the high pressure zone relaxes (is inhibited). With this method, we could measure the magnitude and duration of the inhibitory phenomenon. There is a very good correlation between the degree of deglutitive inhibition and propagation velocity of esophageal contractions. The less inhibition, the faster the propagation velocity of contractions. Simultaneous contractions are the consequence of absent inhibition. Patients with esophageal primary motor disorders may have very fast propagating contractions and a small percentage of simultaneous contractions or up to 100% of simultaneous contractions. The correlation between the degree of inhibition and propagation velocity of contractions suggests that the different primary motor disorders are the expression of a progressive failure in esophageal inhibition.",

      "abstract": "Asphyxia describes any condition that results in oxygen deprivation and, in the unborn or soon-to-be-born infant, may occur prenatally in utero, during delivery or postnatally [1]. In cases of intrapartum asphyxia, the duration of oxygen deprivation may vary and is critical to the ensuing insult to the infant’s vital organs and, especially, to the brain. Oxygen deficiency at tissue level (hypoxia, see Box 60.1) is often accompanied by glucose and nutrient deprivation, and is further compounded by pre-existing or complicating factors in the mother, especially pyrexia, and in the infant such as sepsis or congenital anomalies, the concomitant degree of metabolic derangement (e.g. extent of hypoglycaemia or metabolic acidosis), and the time to delivery and effective resuscitation. All of these factors will potentially compound any hypoxic injury and the extent of any ensuing brain damage, described as hypoxic ischaemic encephalopathy (HIE, Box 60.1). Attempts to assign an HIE ‘grade’ may help to correlate early symptoms and signs with the degree and likelihood of long-term sequelae [2], although accurate prognostication of asphyxial brain damage remains difficult.",

      "abstract": "The primary pathophysiology of acute pancreatitis is due to a low flow state mediated through the neurohumoral mechanisms. Ischemia of the microcirculation, combined with hormonal and other biochemical factors, produces destruction of cellular elements of the pancreas. These changes can be triggered by one or more stressors, including the psychic factor. Emotional stress may not only be responsible for an initial attack of pancreatitis (idiopathic) but must be considered, like any other stressor, to be responsible for exacerbations, relapses or chronicity of pancreatic disease.",

Fragmentation and repetitive arousals/awakenings characterize the sleep of persons with dementia. Confusion, agitation, and wandering can occur at night (“sun downing”), further contributing to sleep disruption (Box 10–1). Sleep complaints may be due primarily to the underlying dementia or to related sleep-disordered breathing, periodic limb movements of sleep, or secondary depression. Reversal of the sleep-wake rhythms can be seen with patients complaining of nocturnal insomnia and excessive daytime sleepiness. Polysomnography may demonstrate decreases in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep time and REM density. Sleep efficiency is reduced. Management includes proper sleep hygiene practices (eg, avoiding caffeine, maintaining a regular sleep schedule, and eliminating daytime naps), and treatment of concurrent depression and medical disorders, including pain syndromes, that might contribute to sleep disturbance. Short-term use of hypnotics, such as zolpidem, zaleplon, or eszopiclone, may be tried for insomnia.",

Cerebral palsy (CP) is a condition where there may be abnormal brain development or brain injury during development. Down's syndrome (also called Trisomy 21) is the most common genetic cause of learning disabilities. Congenital neuromuscular disorders in children include spinal muscular atrophy and muscle disorders such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy and congenital muscular dystrophies. Progressive neurological disorders are extremely rare conditions where deterioration advances over time. Multidisciplinary and multi-agency working is vital in supporting and safeguarding children with complex needs. Gastro-oesophageal reflux (GOR) is the passage of stomach contents into the oesophagus. The transition of children to adult care normally takes place when the child leaves full time education and this could be up to 19 years of age.",

Three patients developed RBD after acute inflammatory encephalitis, which lasted for 3 months to 1 year. They talked, moved and walked nightly while asleep. During night polysomnography, there were REM sleep without atonia and abnormally increased REM sleep as 37â87% of total sleep.

      "title": "Evaluación de la Disfagia en Niños",
      "abstract": "La deglucion constituye un proceso extremadamente complejo cuya seguridad y eficacia dependen de factores anatomicos, sensoriales, neuromotores y funcionales. La alta complejidad del mecanismo deglutorio lo hace al mismo tiempo altamente sensible y vulnerable. Se describen al menos tres fases para la deglucion normal: 1) Fase oral: incluye masticacion, formacion del bolo, sello palato-gloso, propulsion del alimento y sello naso-palatino; 2) Fase faringea: comienza con el cierre o sello naso-palatino e incluye ademas contraccion faringea y cierre de la epiglotis, y; 3) Fase esofagica: es tal vez la fase de la deglucion con la cual esta mas familiarizado el Gastroenterologo. Se inicia con la apertura del esfinter esofagico superior. Cualquier alteracion en las diferentes fases o de algunos de los multiples factores involucrados puede derivar en un cuadro de disfagia, el cual dependiendo de la fase afectada podria clasificarse como oro-faringea, esofagica o mixta. Tal y como establecen los autores del articulo Experiencia en la evaluacion diagnostica y terapeutica de la disfagia oro-faringeaa y esofagica en ninos publicado en el presente numero, la evaluacion de estos pacientes se inicia con la identificacion de factores de riesgo tales como presencia de anomalias anatomicas congenitas, antecedentes de prematuridad, ventilacion mecanica, intubacion endotraqueal, nutricion con sonda naso-enteral, enfermedades sistemicas degenerativas o de caracter autoinmune, traumatismo craneoencefalico, neoplasias, tratamiento con quimioterapia, trastornos neurologicos tipo paralisis cerebral o trastorno neuromotor central no progresivo (mas del 60% de estos pacientes presentan algun tipo de trastorno deglutorio), trastornos del espectro autista y otros. Cualquier individuo con antecedentes similares a los mencionados constituye un paciente de riesgo para el desarrollo de trastornos deglutorios y por lo tanto debe ser vigilado ante la posible aparicion de sintomas sutiles o inespecificos de disfagia. Otro aspecto muy importante a precisar es el riesgo aspirativo. La aspiracion recurrente y sus consecuencias sobre la funcion respiratoria comprometen la calidad de vida y la evolucion a largo plazo de estos pacientes. Diferentes sistemas clinicos de puntuacion o scores han sido disenados para la evaluacion del riesgo aspirativo. Algunos manejan variables que sugieren alto riesgo aspirativo tales como presencia de neumopatia recurrente asociada con aspiracion o penetracion, cianosis o desaturacion durante la alimentacion, etc., y variables que sugieren un riesgo aspirativo moderado tales como esfuerzo respiratorio aumentado durante la alimentacion, presencia de sintomas respiratorios inespecificos intermitentes, etc. La higiene dental adecuada constituye un aspecto fundamental en la prevencion de infecciones respiratorias en el paciente con disfagia y alto riesgo aspirativo. Ahora bien, ?cuales son los sintomas que pueden hacer sospechar un posible trastorno deglutorio en ninos con factores de riesgo o sin ellos?. Los sintomas mas frecuentes son: sialorrea importante y persistente, formacion inadecuada del bolo alimentario, regurgitacion naso-faringea, imposibilidad o retardo en el inicio del proceso deglutorio con retencion del alimento en boca (sugiere posible trastorno sensorial), sintomas de deglucion atipica (posturas anomalas durante la deglucion), tos, carraspeo y ahogos frecuentes, disfonia, tiempo de ingesta prologando, sintomatologia respiratoria recurrente (sugiere aspiracion recurrente) e impactacion de alimentos. La evaluacion del paciente con disfagia constituye un reto para el Gastroenterologo y especialmente para el Gastroenterologo Pediatra. Como parte del protocolo de estudio, particularmente cuando se sospecha por clinica disfagia oro-faringea, se sugiere realizar algunos de los siguientes procedimientos: 1) Observacion de la alimentacion espontanea preferiblemente con saturometria para evaluar posible evento aspirativo: permite determinar en muchos casos la fase de la deglucion afectada y tipificar la disfagia; 2) Test de volumen/ viscosidad: test clinico en el cual se administran en secuencia volumenes crecientes de viscosidades nectar, liquido y pudin permitiendo evaluar el proceso deglutorio y detectar posibles alteraciones de la seguridad o eficacia del mismo; 3) Auscultacion cervical: es un metodo no invasivo muy util que permite la deteccion de patrones sonoros sugestivos de disfagia o aspiracion. 4) Videofl uoroscopia y videodeglutoscopia: considerados los gold standard en la evaluacion del paciente con disfagia. Permiten evaluar el proceso deglutorio e identificar posibles alteraciones tales como refl ujo laringo-faringeo, penetracion, aspiracion, etc. En el paciente con sospecha de disfagia esofagica es necesario descartar trastornos motores primarios o secundarios y obstruccion mecanica secundaria a estenosis, anilllos, membranas u otros. La endoscopia juega un rol importante en el descarte de esofagitis infecciosa, peptica (ERGE) o eosinofilica (EEo). Esta ultima representa hoy por hoy una de las principales causas de disfagia esofagica en el adolescente y adulto joven y debe ser ser considerada en cualquier paciente que consulte por disfagia o impactacion de alimentos. La intervencion en el paciente con disfagia debe siempre y en primer lugar ser de caracter multidisciplinario. Se requiere de especialistas en gastroenterologia, neurologia, foniatria, terapia de lenguaje, nutricion, genetica entre otros para el manejo de estos casos. Entre los objetivos principales del tratamiento se encuentran: 1) Mejorar el manejo de solidos y semi-solidos a mediano y largo plazo; 2) Preservar el estado nutricional y, 3) Reducir el riesgo aspirativo. Cuando por clinica se observan retencion del alimento en boca, preferencia por sabores fuertes y sintomas de aspiracion silente se debe sospechar un posible trastorno sensorial y la terapeutica debe ir orientada entonces a mejorar este aspecto del proceso deglutorio. Las estrategias terapeuticas para el manejo de la disfagia oro-faringea en ninos incluyen terapia de modificacion de conducta, rehabilitacion postural, modificaciones dieteticas, biofeedback, ejercicios de reforzamiento motor-oral, estimulacion sensorial y otros. El aspecto nutricional es fundamental especialmente en el paciente neurologico con disfagia o trastorno deglutorio. Es necesario valorar en cada caso el estado nutricional y realizar encuesta nutricional y estimacion de requerimientos. La terapia de suplementacion nutricional se inicia evaluando en base a las caracteristicas de cada caso la factibilidad de la ingesta por via oral y la capacidad del paciente de satisfacer sus necesidades caloricas. Cuando el compromiso nutricional es muy importante y la ingesta calorica por via oral esta muy comprometida la gastrostomia endoscopica percutanea (GEP) realizada por un Gastroenterologo Pediatra entrenado es una opcion segura, valida y muy efectiva. En el caso del paciente con disfagia esofagica el tratamiento medico-endoscopico dependera de la etiologia del cuadro.",

      "abstract": "Patients with insomnia complain of problems with sleep onset or sleep maintenance or early morning awakenings, or a combination of these, despite adequate opportunity and circumstances for sleep. In addition, to fulfill the diagnostic criteria for insomnia the complaints need to be associated with negative daytime consequences. For chronic insomnia, the symptoms are required to be present at least 3 days per week for a duration of at least 3 months. Lastly, for insomnia to be defined as a disorder, the sleep complaints and daytime symptoms should not be better explained by another sleep disorder. This criterion represents a diagnostic challenge, since patients suffering from other sleep disorders often complain of insomnia symptoms. For instance, insomnia symptoms are common in e.g., obstructive sleep apnea and circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders. It may sometimes be difficult to disentangle whether the patient suffers from insomnia disorder or whether the insomnia symptoms are purely due to another sleep disorder. Furthermore, insomnia disorder may be comorbid with other sleep disorders in some patients, e.g., comorbid insomnia and sleep apnea (COMISA). In addition, insomnia disorder is often comorbid with psychological or somatic disorders and diseases. Thus, a thorough assessment is necessary for correct diagnostics. For chronic insomnia disorder, treatment-of-choice is cognitive behavioral therapy, and such treatment is also effective when the insomnia disorder appears comorbid with other diagnoses. Furthermore, studies suggest that insomnia is a heterogenic disorder with many different phenotypes or subtypes. Different insomnia subtypes may respond differently to treatment, but more research on this issue is warranted. Also, the role of comorbidity on treatment outcome is understudied. This review is part of a Research Topic on insomnia launched by Frontiers and focuses on diagnostic and treatment challenges of the disorder. The review aims to stimulate to more research into the bidirectional associations and interactions between insomnia disorder and other sleep, psychological, and somatic disorders/diseases.",

Se presenta el caso clinico de una paciente de 22 anos con PC, sin retraso mental y con anorexia nerviosa (AN), sin alteracion de la conducta alimentaria previa (criterios diagnosticos segun la CIE-10, 1992). Existen similitudes importantes entre el comportamiento alimentario de los ninos con PC y el comportamiento adoptado por los pacientes con AN, en particular. Ademas de estas comorbilidades, esta presente inclusivamente abuso sexual repetido y un episodio depresivo mayor (CIE-10). El abuso sexual ademas de ser mas frecuente en pacientes con discapacidad (incluyendo PC) tambien parece estar, segun la literatura, relacionado con el trastorno del comportamiento alimentario. El trastorno depresivo mayor aparece aqui favorecido por un terreno fertil en factores de riesgo. Se trata de un caso clinico atipico y desafiante en terminos de diagnostico, pero sobre todo terapeutico, necesitando una intervencion multidisciplinaria que involucre a profesionales de varias areas, en particular psiquiatria, psicologia, terapia del habla, nutricion, psicomotricidad y terapia ocupacional.

There are important similarities between the eating behavior of children with CP and the behavior adopted by patients with AN, in particular. In addition to these comorbidities, repeated sexual abuse and a major depressive episode are also presents (ICD-10). Sexual abuse in addition to being more frequent in patients with disabilities (PC included) also seems to be, according to the literature, related to eating behavior disorder. Major depressive disorder appears here favored by a fertile ground in risk factors It is an atypical and challenging clinical case in terms of diagnosis but above all therapeutic, needing a multidisciplinary intervention that involves professionals from various areas, in particular: psychiatrist, psychologist, speech therapy, nutrition, psychomotor and occupational therapy.",

      "abstract": "Purging disorder is an eating disorder subtype characterized by purging behaviors to control weight (i.e., self-induced vomiting or misuse of laxatives, diuretics, and/or other medications). It was recognized for the first time in the DSM-5 (2013) within the other specified feeding or eating disorder category. The lifetime prevalence of purging disorder is comparable to both anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, placing it as a significant eating disorder phenotype. Purging disorder is symptomatologically similar to bulimia nervosa, except for the absence of binge eating episodes. However, despite the common features with other eating disorders, purging disorder appears as a clinically significant and potentially distinctive disorder. Therefore, the present chapter reviews and discusses the clinical and distinctiveness features of this disorder, as well as the treatments of first choice (i.e., cognitive-behavioral therapy). This chapter also highlights that studies on PD treatment outcomes are currently limited, available results are inconsistent, and evidence-based treatments are lacking.",

      "abstract": "inal symptoms at the same intensity as before treatment, entailing a return of the same episode and a new episode of illness, respectively [6, 9] . When treatment with a CNS drug is discontinued, patients can experience classic new withdrawal symptoms, rebound and/or persistent postwithdrawal disorders, or relapse/recurrence of the original illness [6, 9, 14] . New and rebound symptoms can occur for up to 6 weeks after drug withdrawal, depending on the drug elimination half-life [2, 3] , while persistent postwithdrawal or tardive disorders associated with longlasting receptor changes may persist for more than 6 weeks after drug discontinuation. Initial withdrawal symptoms from CNS drugs have been reported to be more frequent and severe when high-potency drugs and drugs with a short elimination half-life have been used [9, 10] . CNS drugs with a shorter elimination half-life and rapid onset of action also carry a higher risk of dependency and high-dose use [9, 10] . Withdrawal symptoms can be relatively short-lasting, lasting for a few hours to a few weeks with complete recovery, while others may persist and last for several months [1, 15, 16] . Fava et al. [1] have proposed using the terminology ‘withdrawal syndrome’ to replace the term ‘discontinuation syndrome’, which has been most often used to describe SSRI withdrawal. They have recommended the Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are widely used in clinical practice, and have advanced the treatment of depression and other mental disorders. However, more studies are needed on the effects of decreasing and discontinuing these medications after their long-term use [1] . Withdrawal symptoms may occur with all SSRIs and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) [1] , similarly to other CNS drugs, including benzodiazepines [2–4] and antipsychotics [5, 6] . Withdrawal from SSRIs and other CNS drugs produces psychiatric symptoms that can be confounded with true relapse or recurrence of the original illness [1, 2, 7] . When discontinuing or decreasing SSRIs, withdrawal symptoms must be identified to avoid prolonging treatment or giving unnecessarily high doses [6, 8] . Different types of syndromes have been described with the withdrawal from SSRIs and other CNS drug classes, including benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, antidepressants, opiates, barbiturates, and alcohol: (1) new withdrawal symptoms (classic withdrawal symptoms from CNS drugs) [1, 4–6, 9–12] , (2) rebound [2, 6, 9, 13–16] , and (3) persistent postwithdrawal disorders [7, 17, 18] ( table 1 ). These types of withdrawal need to be differentiated from relapse and recurrence of the original illness.

Back pain is sorted into three categories, differentiated by the duration of symptoms. Acute back pain, which is the focus of this article, is classified as pain lasting 6 weeks or less, subacute back pain is pain that has been present between 6 and 12 weeks, and chronic back pain is pain that persists longer than 12 weeks. Etiologies of low back pain include (but are certainly not limited to) mechanical injury (e.g., muscle sprain or spasm, ligament strain, facet joint disruption), arthritis, sciatica (lumbar radiculopathy), spinal fracture, malignancy, connective tissue disease, infection (e.g., vertebral osteomyelitis, epidural abscess), cauda equina syndrome, metabolic causes (e.g., hyperparathyroidism), abdominal or retroperitoneal visceral or vascular processes, psychogenic pain, and malingering. Careful history-taking and physical examination are crucial to diagnosing the etiology of back pain.

Essential features offunctionaldyspepsia include persistent pain or discomfort above the umbilicus, not associated with or relieved by a change of stool frequency or form, as well as a lack of evidence for inflammatory, anatomic, metabolic, or neoplastic conditions. In about 50 % of adults and greater than 70 % of children, the pathophysiology of symptoms of functional dyspepsia is related to abnormalities in the upper gastrointestinal motor function, such as delayed gastric and small intestinal transit, decreased gastric accommodation, and gastric dysrhythmia. Diagnostic evaluation should be driven by an index of clinical suspicion based on pertinent red flags in the history and physical examination. A comprehensive treatment approach uses the biopsychosocial model, which involves a combination of educational, pharmacological, psychological, as well as complementary therapies. Determining the patient's most distressing symptom may also help to target particular treatment options and individualize therapy. Follow-up of dyspeptic patients at 6 months to 2 years revealed that 70 % of subjects were either asymptomatic or much improved regardless of the cause; however, the remainder had neither improvement nor worsening of their symptoms despite aggressive medical management.",

      "abstract": "Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic disease of the digestive tract that is characterised by decades-long chronicity. At the same time, it is particularly challenging to treat since successful treatment often requires a combination of pharmacological and non-pharmacological measures. The pathomechanisms of IBS have only just started to be elucidated, meaning that causally effective treatments are largely lacking. In contrast to earlier notions of a \"psychosomatic disorder\", IBS is an organic disease in the vast majority of cases. The predominant symptoms are usually intestinal cramps or abdominal pain, meteorism/flatulence, constipation, and diarrhea. The patient should be fully included in a joint treatment concept from the outset. Given the lack of causal treatment methods, each treatment approach is initially by way of trial; if there is no effect, treatment should be discontinued after 3 months at the latest. Effective treatments can be continued, adapted, and/or combined with other procedures as an on-demand or permanent treatment. Supplementing the targeted drug treatment of the dominant individual symptoms with somewhat unspecific but often relevantly effective basic or accompanying treatments has proven useful. Such a multimodal treatment strategy, in which general measures as well as nutritional, psychological, and pharmacotherapies are individually combined, is significantly superior to drug monotherapy. This article describes first- and second-line drug treatments in addition to options for refractory symptoms. The choice of drug therapy is primarily determined by the dominant symptoms. Depending on the symptom constellation, it may be beneficial to combine different drugs.",

Moreover, such children are at great risk for retardation of mental development; metabolic, cardiovascular, and malignant diseases; and many other health problems at a later age. Early and late complications of preterm birth depend significantly on the gestational age at birth and the intrauterine development conditions of the fetus. Due to the more severe and complicated course of perinatal pathologies, premature babies with fetal growth retardation syndrome constitute a larger risk group. Approximately 50–70% of these children receive long-term treatment in the neonatal intensive care unit after birth. Furthermore, 70% of them face behavioral and memory problems in later life. While the pathologies of the neonatal period in children born prematurely are mainly related to respiratory, gastrointestinal, neurological, and nutritional problems, the complications of premature birth are manifested in children’s early age, preschool, school, adolescence, and other developmental periods.",

      "abstract": "Eating disorders, especially bulimia, are considered to be the most sensitive barometer of the process of Westernisation and (partly for this reason) cultural, family and psychological factors seem to play a key role in their aetiology. The increase in their frequency can be linked with the significance that is ascribed to the body and eating in Western culture. Viewed from the psychodynamic perspective, eating disorders are treated as a formed by a culture symptomatic manifestation of dysfunction of very varied personality, neurotic and prepsychotic mechanisms. They are expressed through a person's attitude to their own body and eating. The relation between the body and food may be treated as a metaphor of the relation of the female patient with various aspects of herself and significant persons in her life. The mechanisms of arising of psychological bulimia and anorexia are convergent in this model. Differences in the clinical picture are linked with the strength of mechanisms of control. In the case of anorexia nervosa restrictive type, we are dealing with complete control over the body and eating as an expression of denial of various desires and impulses. In the case of bulimia nervosa and bulimic symptoms in anorexia nervosa, we observe the occurrence of alternate yielding to desires and impulses in the act of eating and a denial of yielding to them in vomiting and other compensatory behaviours. An attempt to understand the links between the individual bulimic psychopathology of the patient and functioning of the family system constitutes an important supplement to the above theories. Many authors draw attention to the similarity of functioning of families with anorexia and bulimia. Open and stormy expression of tension is typical for bulimic families, as are various traumas concerning children. The conceptions presented above should be considered to have practical significance in the course of therapy rather than as exhaustive descriptions of all determinants of eating disorders.",

Insomnia can be primary, in which the sleep disturbance exists in the absence of co-existing medical or psychiatric disorders, or comorbid, when it is accompanied by one of these disorders. Although a diagnosis of insomnia requires difficulty with sleep, insomnia is a 24-hour disorder. Individuals with insomnia describe difficulties with concentration, fatigue, and mood, which both influence, and are influenced by, the sleep disturbance. In addition, insomnia is associated with a substantially elevated risk of incident major depressive disorder (MDD), panic disorder, and substance abuse disorders.

      "abstract": "Eating disorders affect about 5% of adolescent girls and young adult women. They are much less common among men. They typically begin in adolescence and may run a chronic course, interfering with psychological, physical, and social functioning. Three eating disorders are distinguished: (1) anorexia nervosa; (2) bulimia nervosa; and (3) a residual diagnostic category—the most common seen in routine clinical practice— termed ‘eating disorder not otherwise specified’ (eating disorder NOS). They all share a distinctive ‘core psychopathology’, the overevaluation of shape and weight, and patients frequently move between the categories, hence a case may be made for adopting a ‘transdiagnostic’ perspective....",

      "title": "Anorexia in Exercise and Sport",
      "abstract": "Introduction: Mental disorders that are associated with severe disturbances in eating behavior are called “eating disorders.” According to the American Psychiatric Association1, a mental disorder consists of “a clinically significant behavioral or psychological syndrome or pattern that occurs in an individual and that is associated with present distress (e.g., a painful symptom) or disability (i.e., impairment in one or more important areas of functioning) or with a significantly increased risk of suffering death, pain, disability, or an important loss of freedom.” Of particular attention here is the eating disorder of anorexia nervosa. This disorder amounts to a refusal to maintain a normal body weight. In the fourth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric Association (DSM-IV, pp. 544–545), the diagnostic criteria for anorexia nervosa (See Table 1) are associated with physical symptoms (abnormal body weight, amenorrhea) and psychological symptoms (fear in gaining weight and body image disturbances).Table 1: A. Diagnostic Criteria for Anorexia NervosaDiscussion: Although the incidence of clinically diagnosed anorexia nervosa is only about 1% in the U.S. population, its prevalence among athletes in sports that emphasize leanness has been estimated to be much higher. Part of this confusion comes from misinterpreting scores on questionnaires such as the Eating Disorders Inventory (EDI) or the Eating Attitudes Test (EAT). These standardized instruments are not designed to determine psychopathology since it takes a clinical interview to determine if the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria are met. Instead, the EDI and EAT are useful in determining who might be at risk for meeting the diagnostic criteria of anorexia nervosa. Athletes in sports that emphasize leanness will often have elevated scores on the drive for thinness scale of the EDI2. However, when athletes are subjected to a clinical interview, most of those classified as “at risk,” are not found to have a true clinical relevant “eating disorder.” Higher scores on the EDI, for instance, may be only be a rationale response on the part of the athlete and may not represent a clinical eating disorder. As O'Connor and Smith3 have pointed out, a higher drive for thinness score may merely represent a desire to perform well, especially in light of the time the athlete has devoted to the sport. Evidence from several sources suggests that athletes are more apt to have “subclinical or disordered eating patterns,” particularly when their sports are in-season. However, the disordered eating patterns seen in most athletes are not of the severity that would qualify as a clinically diagnosed eating disorder.",

      "title": "Η σχέση υποκειμενικής γνωστικής έκπτωσης και διατροφής στον ελληνικό πληθυσμό τρίτης ηλικίας",
      "abstract": "Τα τελευταία χρόνια κερδίζει έδαφος η ιδέα της υποκειμενικής γνωστικής έκπτωσης (ΥΓΕ) ως υποψηφίου ισοδυνάμου του προκλινικού σταδίου της νόσου Alzheimer. Ως υποκειμενική γνωστική έκπτωση (subjective cognitive decline) ορίζουμε την (αυθόρμητη ή μη) αναφορά από ένα άτομο παραπόνων για εμμένουσα έκπτωση της μνήμης ή άλλων γνωστικών λειτουργιών σε σχέση με το προηγούμενο επίπεδο, χωρίς από την αντικειμενική εξέταση να προκύπτει νευρογνωστική διαταραχή (ήπια γνωστική διαταραχή ή κλινική άνοια), λαμβανομένων υπόψη της ηλικίας, του φύλου και του μορφωτικού επιπέδου. Η έκπτωση πρέπει επίσης να μη σχετίζεται με κάποιο οξύ συμβάν και να μην μπορεί να εξηγηθεί από άλλη νευρολογική, ψυχιατρική ή παθολογική νόσο, λήψη φαρμάκων ή ουσιών. Τα δεδομένα υποδηλώνουν ότι τα άτομα αυτά έχουν αυξημένο κίνδυνο νόσησης από άνοια στο μέλλον και συνιστούν ελκυστικό ερευνητικό στόχο, τόσο για επιδημιολογικές, όσο και παρεμβατικές μελέτες.Εφόσον η ΥΓΕ είναι παράγοντας κινδύνου για τη μετέπειτα εγκατάσταση κλινικής άνοιας, είναι ιδιαίτερα ενδιαφέρον να μελετηθούν οι παράμετροι που θα μπορούσαν να επηρεάσουν αυτήν την εξέλιξη. Ένας από τους πιο ενδιαφέροντες παράγοντες που σχετίζονται με τον τρόπο ζωής είναι η διατροφή, η οποία προσφέρεται ως στόχος για την υιοθέτηση ευρείας κλίμακας στρατηγικών πρόληψης της γνωστικής έκπτωσης με καλή σχέση κόστους-αποτελεσματικότητας. Καθώς η διεθνής βιβλιογραφία παρουσιάζει σημαντικές ελλείψεις στη μελέτη της σχέσης ΥΓΕ και διατροφής, η παρούσα διδακτορική διατριβή φιλοδοξεί να συνεισφέρει στην κάλυψη αυτού του κενού. Για το σκοπό αυτό, η εργασία στηρίχθηκε στα δεδομένα της μελέτης HELIAD [Hellenic Epidemiological Longitudinal Investigation of Aging and Diet (Νευροεκφυλιστικές και άλλες νευρολογικές νόσοι στον ελληνικό πληθυσμό – συχνότητες και παράγοντες κινδύνου)] και κινήθηκε σε δύο παράλληλους σχεδιασμούς:1.Συγχρονική μελέτη (cross-sectional), με στόχο τη διερεύνηση του επιπολασμού συγκεκριμένων ειδών ΥΓΕ και της σχέσης τους με ποικίλους παράγοντες, μεταξύ των οποίων και τη διατροφή·2.Προοπτική μελέτη (prospective cohort), με στόχο τη διερεύνηση της επίδρασης της διατροφής στην εξέλιξη της ΥΓΕ στο χρόνο.Τα παράπονα που σχετίζονται με ΥΓΕ αναδείχθηκαν με τη βοήθεια ενός δομημένου καταλόγου ερωτήσεων/θεμάτων για συζήτηση με το συμμετέχοντα. Η ΥΓΕ ταξινομήθηκε ανάλογα με το γνωστικό πεδίο στο οποίο ο συμμετέχων εντοπίζει προβλήματα, δηλαδή τη μνήμη, το λόγο, την οπτική-αντιληπτική και την επιτελική λειτουργία. Οι συμμετέχοντες θεωρήθηκαν θετικοί για ένα είδος ΥΓΕ σε περίπτωση τουλάχιστον μίας θετικής απάντησης στις ερωτήσεις του συγκεκριμένου γνωστικού πεδίου. Η συνολική βαθμολογία ΥΓΕ ορίστηκε ως ο αριθμός των αναφερόμενων γνωστικών πεδίων με ΥΓΕ και συνεπώς κυμαίνεται από 0 ως 4.Με βάση τα ευρήματα από το συγχρονικό σκέλος της μελέτης, η ΥΓΕ στον ελληνικό πληθυσμό ≥65 ετών είναι πολύ συχνή (84,6%) και εστιάζεται κυρίως στη μνήμη. Τα συμπτώματα άγχους και η ύπαρξη αγγειακού εγκεφαλικού κινδύνου σχετίζονται με αυξημένη πιθανότητα ΥΓΕ, ενώ προστατευτικό ρόλο φαίνεται να έχει η εκπαίδευση. Όσον αφορά τα είδη ΥΓΕ, σημειώνεται η επιβαρυντική δράση του γυναικείου φύλου, της γενετικής προδιάθεσης για γνωστική έκπτωση και της αυξημένης ενεργειακής πρόσληψης στην εμφάνιση υποκειμενικής έκπτωσης στη μνήμη. Η παρουσία συμπτωμάτων κατάθλιψης ή/και άγχους και η πρόοδος της ηλικίας συνδέονται επίσης με τα περισσότερα είδη ΥΓΕ.Αναλύοντας τα δεδομένα από την προοπτική παρακολούθηση του δείγματός μας, υπολογίσαμε ότι αρχική συμμόρφωση με το διατροφικό πρότυπο της μεσογειακής δίαιτας υψηλότερη κατά 10 μονάδες στην κλίμακα MDS (Mediterranean Diet Score) σχετίζεται με μείωση κατά 7% στην εξέλιξη της ΥΓΕ ανά έτος, και ότι κάθε επιπλέον μερίδα λαχανικών καθημερινά σχετίζεται με περιορισμό κατά 2,2% της προόδου της ΥΓΕ ανά έτος. Τα αποτελέσματά μας ενισχύουν την άποψη ότι η μεσογειακή δίαιτα δρα προστατευτικά έναντι ολόκληρου του συνεχούς της γνωστικής έκπτωσης, ξεκινώντας από τα πρώτα γνωστικά παράπονα. Η επιβεβαίωση των ευρημάτων αυτών και από άλλες μελέτες, ιδίως για συγκεκριμένες ομάδες τροφίμων, και η αποσαφήνιση των υποκείμενων μηχανισμών μπορεί να ενδυναμώσει το ρόλο της μεσογειακής δίαιτας ως εύκολα εφαρμόσιμης, χαμηλού κόστους και υψηλής αποτελεσματικότητας στρατηγικής πρόληψης που στοχεύει τους τροποποιήσιμους παράγοντες κινδύνου για γνωστική έκπτωση.",

Ama initiate the disease process of Grahani causing vitiation of doshas. These very much resembles the Irritable Bowel Syndrome. IBS is a chronic relapsing disorder of gastrointestinal function; the main features are abdominal pain associated with an altered bowel habit (may present with diarrhoea or constipation or intermittently both). In Charaka Bhunimbadya churna mentioned in Grahani Chikitsa is highly effective, promote appetite, digestion and remove Ama Dosha from the system by increasing the power of Agni. Hence it is the need of the hour to establish a firm clinical research based scientific data for classical treatments. It is presumed that Bhunimbadya churna is effective in case of Grahani & effectively control the clinical condition associated with this disease. Total 20 patients of Grahani were registered for clinical trial of 45days. Result of the study revealed that Bhunimbadya churna produced significant results in almost all cases barring a few patients who were suffering from longer period.",

For up to 10% of the general population, difficulty falling and/or maintaining sleep occurs several times a week (i.e., chronic insomnia). Some of these problems may be due to existences of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, a condition that affects over 10% of the population, or due to restless leg syndrome (RLS)/periodic leg movement syndrome (PLMS), sleep-related involuntary leg movements often associated with an abnormal sensation in legs. Excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), parasomnia, and sleep problems associated with medical/psychiatric conditions are also common. Narcolepsy is a primary EDS disorder affecting about 0.05% of the population. EDS is also often secondary to a severe insomnia associated with obstructive sleep apnea.",

It is defined as the persistent intake of non-nutritional substances for at least one month, in an inappropriate way from an evolutionary perspective, and provided that its practice is not culturally banned. Many animal species, including primates, have this behavior. Documented from antiquity, in most cases it has been considered a symptom of another related disorder rather than as independent condition. Its prevalence is unknown. It is mainly described in mentally disabled people, pregnant women, autism, mentally ill patients, children, and others. The ingestion of earth, ice, starch, ropes, wood, and other products has been observed, although some authors also include the obsessive and reiterative consumption of eatable substances. Geophagia is considered a cultural phenomenon, although sometimes may lead to disease, and an form of paleomedicine or paleonutrition. The etiology of pica is unknown and it has no markers. Sensitive, digestive, nutritional, psychological, and psychiatric factors have been implicated in its origin and maintenance. Although the morbimortality is unknown and difficult to study, we may highlight intoxications, parasitic diseases, and surgical abdomen with serious complications. Finally, as in other eating behavior disorders, the global management of this entity requires a coordinated intervention of different health care professionals.",

Behavioral, psychological, environmental, physiologic, metabolic, and genetic explanations are just some of the possibilities identified as contributing to or causing obesity; yet, each explanation encounters controversy and no one explanation has gained unanimous consensus. Ideally, once a patient has had weight loss surgery (WLS), he or she loses excess weight in a controlled, healthy manner and complies with all the components of the recommended bariatric treatment program; sometimes, however, patients \"modify\" their post-surgical instructions. The ability to identify program modifications may be initially camouflaged if patients continue to lose weight and their laboratory values and other medical tests indicate that their weight loss status is smoothly progressing. On the surface it may seem that all is well, but appearances may be deceiving. A dysfunctional relationship with food and other substances of abuse, such as alcohol, may be lurking underneath the surface of what passes as treatment success, and this condition, left untreated, may persist or evolve to a cross-addiction, also known as an addiction transfer or a substitute addiction. A cross-addiction occurs when an individual exchanges one compulsive behavior for another compulsive behavior, such as when a weight loss surgery patient is no longer overeating or bingeing, but instead is abusing alcohol. An incisive and comprehensive nursing assessment that includes how, why, and in what manner the WLS patient is losing weight needs to be conducted to uncover established or developing cross-addictive behaviors. Clearly, assuming that any weight loss is better than no weight loss is a dangerous proposition when the mechanisms of how this weight loss occurred are not identified.",

The mainstay of current treatment is adapting a conservative approach towards reversing the systemic effects and optimizing the mechanics of defecation through the use of laxatives and irrigation approaches. When successful, this approach improves both evacuation and incontinence symptoms, with associated improvements in quality of life and independence. Future therapies may be directed at modulating pelvic innervation through electrical stimulation. Stoma formation remains an option for patients refractory to other approaches.",

They include several, usually distinct, clinical syndromes-e.g., Kearns-Sayre syndrome, Leigh disease, mitochondrial neurogastrointestinal encephalomyopathy (MNGIE), myoclonus epilepsy with ragged red fibers (MERRF), and mitochondrial encephalopathy with lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes (MELAS)(3,4). Some patients with mitochondrial encephalopathy have symptoms of gastrointestinal involvement. Episodic vomiting is one of the well-known symptoms in MELAS, Leigh disease, and MNGIE(3,5). No previous reports of SMA syndrome associated with severe weight loss related to mitochondrial encephalopathy have been published. We present the first such case and discuss the predisposition to this syndrome in children with metabolic diseases, characterized by recurrent vomiting and severe weight loss. CASE REPORT The patient, a 15-year-old boy, was referred to our hospital because of severe vomiting and weight loss. His early medical history was uneventful. He had been born at term and weighed 3,200 g. There were no perinatal abnormalities. Mental and physical development were normal in early childhood. However, at age 7, he began to have unilateral seizures with ocular deviation, for which he received anticonvulsant drugs. His development had been retarded since then. Computed tomographic scan of the brain, performed when he was 8 years old, revealed bilateral calcification of the basal ganglia. Abnormal Q waves were observed on the electrocardiogram, and there was dilated cardiomyopathy. Funduscopic examinations showed generalized pigmentary retinopathy without ophthalmoplegia. At the age of 8, the patient's blood concentration of lactate was 2.01 mmol/l (normal, 1.00-1.78 mmol/l), and the level of pyruvate was 0.102 mmol/l(normal, 0.034-0.068 mmol/l). The cerebrospinal fluid level of lactate was elevated to 4.74 mmol/l (upper limit, 2.22 mmol/l); that of pyruvate was 0.181 mmol/l (upper limit, 0.227 mmol/l). The lactate-pyruvate ratio was 19.7 in peripheral blood (upper limit, 20) and 26.9 in cerebrospinal fluid (upper limit, 25), respectively. An open muscle biopsy sample was obtained from the left rectus femoris. Modified Gomori's trichrome staining showed ragged red fibers with no other abnormalities. Enzyme activities of rotenone-sensitive NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex I), succinate-ubiquinone oxidoreductase (complex II), ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase (complex III), cytochrome c oxidase (complex IV), and oligomycin-sensitive ATPase(complex V) were measured in accordance with previously reported methods(6). The enzyme activity of complex I of the patient's mitochondria was within normal range, whereas the enzyme activities of complexes II, III, IV, and V of the mitochondria were several times higher than normal values. These high levels of enzyme activities are attributable to the increased number of mitochondria in the tissue, appearing as ragged red fibers. Because all subunits of complex II are encoded by nuclear genes, whereas some of the subunits of complexes I, III, IV, and V are encoded by mitochondrial genes, it seems reasonable to compare the ratios of the activities of other complexes with those of the activity of complex II. Complex I activity, relative to complex II activity in the mitochondria, was markedly lower (19%) than that in normal control subjects(Table). Subunits of complex I, III, IV, and V were analyzed by Western blotting with specific antibodies, according to the method of Tanaka et al(7). Results of immunoblot analysis of the subunits are shown in Figure 1. The amounts of subunits of complex III, IV, and V in the mitochondria markedly increased. However, the amounts of complex I subunits were almost normal. Similar disproportionate deficiency of respiratory enzymes has been reported in other patients with mitochondrial diseases (8-10). These laboratory values established the diagnosis of a relatively deficient complex I. Mitochondrial DNA analysis (11) was performed to detect point mutations that have been described in association with MELAS, MERRF, and Leigh disease. Results of the analysis were normal at the following nucleotide positions: nt 3243, nt 3252, and nt 3271 in tRNA for leucine in MELAS; nt 8344 and nt 8356 in tRNA for lysine in MERRF; nt 8993 in the gene for subunit 6 of ATPase in Leigh disease. Episodic attacks of vomiting occurred, with and without overexertion and stress, and the patient required fluid supplementation for dehydration. When he was 15 years old, he consulted a local physician for recurrent vomiting, weight loss, and symptoms of ileus. His condition deteriorated, and he was referred to our hospital for complete examination and treatment. On admission, he was 142.7 cm tall and weighed 27.4 kg, approximately 68% of his ideal weight for height. His skin was dry, with a decrease in turgor. There was severe abdominal distension with a decrease in bowel sounds. Neurologic examination showed bilateral pyramidal signs. An abdominal radiograph showed a double-bubble sign, with diminished gas shadows in the lower part of the gastrointestinal tract. An upper gastrointestinal series was performed, using barium introduced through a nasogastric tube. We observed an abrupt termination of the contrast-filled column in the horizontal portion of the duodenum, with dilatation of the first and second portions of the duodenum and antiperistaltic flow of the contrast medium (Fig. 2). These results led to a definitive diagnosis of SMA syndrome. The patient was treated conservatively. After the gastric contents were aspirated, a nasoduodenal tube was passed beyond the site of the obstruction into the paroximal jejunum, which led to a cessation of vomiting. Initial enteral feeding of 720 kcal/day by nasoduodenal tube, which was increased gradually to 1,500 kcal/day, resulted in significant improvement in his nutritional status. After 3 months, his weight increased from 27.4 to 35 kg, or 87% of his ideal body weight. All nutritional parameters were improved: serum transferrin was increased from 1,880 to 3,070 mg/l, prealbumin was increased from 132 to 287 mg/l, and retinol binding protein was increased from 22 to 57 mg/l. An upper gastrointestinal series performed 3 months later revealed no duodenal obstruction. Therefore, the patient was allowed oral intake of the enteral preparation. After 1 month of oral feeding, the duodenal tube was removed. The patient was able to eat a normal diet, and his weight gradually increased to 40 kg. At 12-month follow-up, he had not experienced a recurrence of SMA syndrome. DISCUSSION We have described SMA syndrome in a child with mitochondrial encephalopathy. Disorders of the mitochondrial respiratory chain are heterogeneous in clinical phenotype and biochemical abnormalities. Biochemical and immunoblot analysis in this patient showed relative complex I deficiency. Complex I deficiency is known to be present in such conditions as MERRF, MELAS, MNGIE, and Leigh disease. Episodic vomiting is common in MELAS. However, our patient could not be classified clinically as having MELAS, because he had not had stroke-like episodes. Mitochondrial DNA analysis was performed to detect point mutations that have been described in association with MELAS. The common point mutations at nt 3243, nt 3255, and nt 3271 were not seen in his lymphocytes. Calcification of bilateral basal ganglia suggest a possibility of Leigh disease; however, ragged red fibers usually do not appear in Leigh disease. The point mutation reported in Leigh disease was not detected. Ophthalmoplegia, peripheral neuropathy, gastrointestinal symptoms, and leukoencephalopathy are clinical characteristics of MNGIE. Our patient had no peripheral neuropathy or ophthalmoplegia. Improvement of gastrointestinal symptoms, including vomiting, by short-term conservative enteral nutrition showed that episodic vomiting is not attributable to mitochondrial dysfunction in itself. What would cause SMA syndrome in a patient with mitochondrial encephalopathy? The horizontal portion of the duodenum passes in front of the abdominal aorta and behind the superior mesenteric artery, at the level of the first lumbar vertebra (i.e., the SMA may compress the relatively immobile third portion of the duodenum to produce a “nutcracker” effect[12]). Precipitating factors of SMA syndrome include a prolonged supine position, visceroptosis, exaggerated lumbar lordosis, abnormally high fixation of the duodenal fixture of the ligament of Treitz, an unusually low origin of the SMA, loss of muscle tone in the duodenum, and a marked loss of weight with an associated loss of mesenteric and retroperitoneal fat (13). Severe weight loss and malnutrition, caused by repeated episodes of vomiting associated with mitochondrial encephalopathy, were the apparent precipitating factors in our patient. Radiographs of the upper gastrointestinal tract with use of contrast medium is the standard method for diagnosing the SMA syndrome. Hines et al. cited the following roentgenographic criteria for this syndrome: dilatation of the first and second portions of the duodenum, abrupt vertical and oblique compression of the mucosal folds, antiperistaltic flow of barium proximal to the obstruction producing to-and-fro movements, a 4- to 6-hour delay in transit through the gastroduodenal region, and relief of obstruction when the patient is placed in a position that diminishes the drag of the small bowel mesentery(2). Our patient met most of these criteria. There is a danger of missing a diagnosis of duodenal obstruction in mitochondrial encephalopathy because this disorder is also characterized by episodic vomiting. Therefore, SMA syndrome should be considered when making the diagnosis of duodenal obstruction. To our knowledge, this is the first report of SMA syndrome in a patient with mitochondrial encephalopathy. The syndrome may thus be associated with such metabolic disorders as mitochondrial encephalopathy that are characterized by recurrent vomiting.Fig. 1: .

      "title": "Stay Awake! Understanding, Diagnosing, and Successfully Managing Narcolepsy",
      "abstract": "Sleep is a physiologic state that performs an essential restorative function and facilitates learning and memory consolidation. (1) When sleep is disrupted for more than a short time, normal daily functions decline. Mood, attention, and behavior deteriorate. Sleepiness and disrupted sleep can result from a large number of pathological disorders. Currently, 88 sleep disorders are listed in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, as established by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, and sleep disorders adversely affect more than an estimated 70 million Americans. (2) Most of these disorders can be classified as causing insomnia and/or hypersomnia. Insomnia results from disorders that cause difficulty with falling asleep and staying asleep; examples are hyperarousal, circadian dysrhythmia, and homeostatic dysregulation. (3,4) In contrast, hypersomnia refers to difficulty in staying awake and is characterized by recurrent episodes of excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) or prolonged nighttime sleep. Hypersomnia can result from several primary sleep disorders, including narcolepsy, sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, idiopathic hypersomnia, and periodic limb movement disorder. (5) The effects of some of these sleep disorders and other chronic illnesses on daytime sleepiness are measured using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS; TABLE 1). (6,7) Narcolepsy was found to cause some of the highest measures of excessive sleepiness (FIGURE 1). This supplement uses a case-based approach to describe the underlying pathology and symptoms of narcolepsy. Differential diagnosis of narcolepsy and current treatment options will be discussed. Overview of narcolepsy Narcolepsy is a chronic, neurologic sleep disorder that results from the dysregulation of sleep-wake cycles. (8,9) Its 4 classic symptoms are EDS, cataplexy (a sudden drop in muscle tone that is triggered by emotional factors), sleep paralysis (a generalized flaccid paralysis that happens slightly before or at the time of falling asleep or on awakening), and hypnagogic hallucinations (hallucinations that occur while falling asleep). (8,10,11) EDS is the symptom that is experienced by almost all patients with narcolepsy. (10) Cataplexy is present in about 70% of patients with narcolepsy, whereas sleep paralysis (30% to 50%) and hypnagogic hallucinations (20% to 40%) are experienced less often; all 4 symptoms are present in an estimated 11% to 14% of patients with narcolepsy. (11) Although the origins of narcolepsy are still not well known, clinical understanding of the neurologic dysfunction that underlies narcolepsy as well as treatment options have increased markedly in the last decade. Prevalence and risk factors According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, narcolepsy is the third most frequently diagnosed primary sleep disorder found in patients who seek treatment at sleep clinics, after obstructive sleep apnea and restless legs syndrome. (8) Narcolepsy appears throughout the world in every racial and ethnic group, but prevalence rates vary. (8,12) Reports in the United States estimate a prevalence of 1 per 2000 population, whereas the prevalence in Japan is considerably higher (about 1 per 600 population) and in Israel it is much lower (about 1 per 500,000 population). (8,9,11,12) Its incidence has been estimated to be about 0.74 per 100,000 person-years for narcolepsy with cataplexy, and 1.37 per 100,000 person-years for narcolepsy with or without cataplexy. (13) Although narcolepsy is about as common as multiple sclerosis, it is underdiagnosed and undertreated (8,12); the delay between the emergence of the initial symptoms and diagnosis is usually more than 10 years. (14) [FIGURE 1 OMITTED] The initiating event for narcolepsy is not well understood, but infection, immune system dysfunction, trauma, hormonal changes, or stress may be present before narcoleptic symptoms become manifest. …",

Emotional abuse is being threatened, terrorized, severely rejected, isolated, ignored, or verbally attacked. Physical abuse is any form of violence against one’s body, such as being hit, kicked, restrained, or deprived of food or water. Sexual abuse is being forced, threatened, or deceived into sexual activities ranging from looking or touching to intercourse or rape.",

      "abstract": "We present diagnostic criteria for mal de débarquement syndrome (MdDS) for inclusion into the International Classification of Vestibular Disorders. The criteria include the following: 1] Non-spinning vertigo characterized by an oscillatory perception (‘rocking,’ ‘bobbing,’ or ‘swaying’) present continuously or for most of the day; 2] Onset occurs within 48 hours after the end of exposure to passive motion, 3] Symptoms temporarily reduce with exposure to passive motion (e.g. driving), and 4] Symptoms persist for &gt;48 hours. MdDS may be designated as “in evolution,” if symptoms are ongoing but the observation period has been less than 1 month; “transient,” if symptoms resolve at or before 1 month and the observation period extends at least to the resolution point; or “persistent” if symptoms last for more than 1 month. Individuals with MdDS may develop co-existing symptoms of spatial disorientation, visual motion intolerance, fatigue, and exacerbation of headaches or anxiety. Features that distinguish MdDS from vestibular migraine, motion sickness, and persistent postural perceptual dizziness (PPPD) are reviewed. Motion-moderated oscillatory vertigo can also occur without a motion trigger, typically following another vestibular disorder, a medical illness, heightened psychological stress, or metabolic disturbance. Terminology for this non-motion triggered presentation has been varied as it has features of both MdDS and PPPD. Further research is needed into its phenomenological and biological relationship to MdDS, PPPD, and other vestibular disorders.",

      "abstract": "Laxative abuse syndrome (LAS) is a type of Münchausen syndrome characterized by surreptitious abuse of purgatives. Clinical findings are often perplexing and may mimic inflammatory bowel disease or malabsorption syndromes. Patients frequently complain of diarrhea alternating with constipation and may have nausea, vomiting and weight loss. Psychiatric disturbances are common and may include anorexia nervosa. Melanosis coli and cathartic colon, acid-base disturbances (usually metabolic alkalosis), sodium, potassium and water depletion, hyperuricemia, hyperaldosteronism and other electrolyte changes are possible complications. Diagnosis may be extremely difficult and may require special chemical analysis of urine and feces and search of the patient's possessions. Treatment is frustrating because the patient is rarely willing to admit to laxative abuse let alone cooperate in attempting to stop it. Physicians must be aware of the LAS in order to avoid harming the patient with extensive, expensive and often invasive (including laparotomy) procedures.",

      "abstract": "Although patients with non-ulcer dyspepsia (NUD) and peptic ulcer disease present similar symptoms, the two diseases are pathophysiologically completely different and should be treated accordingly. The diagnosis of NUD is still based on negative criteria, i.e., organic diseases must be excluded. The majority of the patients with NUD have a functional disorder possibly as a consequence of psychological stress which, by activating processes within the central nervous system, may evoke a sequence of reactions; By suppressing the vagal tone, fundic adaptation to ingested food may be impaired and the gastric antrum abnormally filled. The latter may contribute to largely unrecognized cause of epigastric discomfort. Increased responsiveness or hypersensitivity to visceral (gastric distention) and psychological (mental stress) stimuli may constitute important factors contributing to perception of discomfort, possibly as abnormal perception of normal events. The treatment of such a complex condition is difficult and may not be solved by medical intervention solely. Patients presenting with dyspepsia of unknown origin, should primarily be treated with antacids. Treatment with prokinetics (cisapride) is rational and worth trying. Antacids and H2-receptor antagonists may help in NUD patients with acid reflux. In patients with Helicobacter pylori-induced gastritis Al-Mg-antacids suppress, but alone do not eradicate the bacteria. Antacids in combination with oxytetracycline and metronidazole eradicate H. pylori in about one half of the infected patients.",

Terms such as hyperacute or fulminant hepatic necrosis have been used to emphasize the rapidity and severity of the condition. The onset of acute liver failure is heralded by an altered mental state, often with agitation and confusion that may proceed to coma, and by evidence of coagulopathy [1–4]. The diagnosis of acute liver failure requires that these symptoms develop in a patient without preexisting chronic liver disease. Although not all observers agree on precise definitions, it is generally accepted that onset of liver-related illness (usually, but not always, accompanied by jaundice) less than 8 weeks before patient presentation with altered mentation and coagulopathy fits the designation of acute liver failure. Development of these signs within a week of onset of liver disease and as much as 6 months from the first sign of illness is sometimes referred to as hyperacute and subacute liver failure, respectively.",

Of note, two key changes in DSM-5 pertinent to older adults are elimination of minor depression from the appendix and elimination of the bereavement exclusion criterion for major depression. In a helpful addition, the DSM-5 major depression criteria now include a \"note\" on the relationship between depressive symptoms and response to significant loss. Depressive symptoms are likewise present in other DSM-5 disorders, such as adjustment disorder with depressed mood and mood disorder due to a general medical condition (see Table 5–1 ). Subtypes of depression and bipolar disorder in later life Depressive disorders Major depression, single episode or recurrent episode Psychotic depression Persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia) Adjustment disorder with depressed mood Substance/medication-induced depressive disorder Depressive disorder due to another medical condition Other specified depressive disorder Unspecified depressive disorder Bipolar and related disorders Bipolar I disorder Bipolar II disorder Cyclothymic disorder Substance/medication-induced bipolar and related disorder Bipolar and related disorder due to another medical condition Other specified bipolar and related disorder Unspecified bipolar and related disorder A bipolar I disorder diagnosis describes a condition in which a patient has experienced at least one manic episode with or without history of a depressive episode. A manic episode is defined as an alteration in mood that is euphoric, expansive, or irritable; lasts for at least 1 week; and occurs with three other associated symptoms (e.g., decreased need for sleep, increased energy, racing thoughts, pressured speech, increased behaviors that may have high likelihood for bad outcome). Manic episodes in later life also may present with a mixture of manic, dysphoric, and cognitive symptoms, with euphoria being less common (Post 1978). When mania is associated with significant changes in cognitive function—so-called manic delirium—it may be difficult to distinguish from organic conditions or schizophrenia (Shulman 1986). A diagnosis of bipolar II disorder can be made when a patient has experienced one or more depressive episodes accompanied by at least one hypomanic episode. A hypomanic episode is defined as at least 4 days of altered mood (expansive, euphoric, irritable) occurring with at least three other associated symptoms (see above). Bipolar disorder not otherwise specified is defined as disorders with bipolar features that do not meet the criteria for specific bipolar disorders.",

A diagnosis of childhood abdominal epilepsy seems proper when recurrent abdominalgia lasts seconds or minutes and is accompanied by disturbance of awareness or responsiveness or by grand or petit mal seizures and electroencephalographic changes. These usually are controlled by treatment with diphenylhydantoin. Otherwise, some included cases differ. Febrile episodes lasted several days and recurred about weekly, biweekly, monthly, or irregularly for decades. Combinations of abdominalgia, stethalgia, or arthralgia with leukocytosis occurred. Electroencephalographic changes occasionally were abnormal; there were no epileptiform seizures and therapy had no effect. Such features characterize periodic polyserositis (known also as familial Mediterranean fever). It affects chiefly Jews, Armenians, and Arabs.<sup>1</sup>Correct diagnosis would clarify nosology, obviate unnecessary therapy, and avoid",

Sie sind charakterisiert durch Symptome wie Oberbauchschmerzen, Vollegefuhl etc. sowie durch das Fehlen struktureller Lasionen oder biochemischer Abnormalitaten, die diese Symptome erklaren. Die funktionelle Dyspepsie mit auf den Oberbauch bezogenen chronischen oder chronisch rezidivierenden Symptomen ist dabei eine der wichtigsten Erkrankungen, die in der Klinik Anlass gibt fur endoskopische Untersuchungen.\r\nHinsichtlich der Pathogenese der Symptome wird heute angenommen, dass neben Motilitatsstorungen vor allem Veranderungen der gastrointestinalen Sensorik eine zentrale Rolle einnehmen. So sind bei Patienten im Vergleich zu gesunden Probanden die Schwellen fur die Wahrnehmung und das Auftreten von Beschwerden bei mechanischer Distension des Magens signifikant niedriger als bei gesunden Probanden . Neben Unterschieden hinsichtlich der Wahrnehmungsschwellen sind Patienten gekennzeichnet durch gestorte adaptive Veranderungen der Wahrnehmungsschwellen nach repetitiver mechanischer Stimulation oder einer mukosalen Schleimhautschadigung durch nicht-steroidale Antirheumatika (NSAR). Ziel der vorliegenden Untersuchung war es, den Einfluss opioiderger Bahnen fur die Modulation viszeraler Wahrnehmungsschwellen zu erfassen und die Effekte bei Patienten mit funktioneller Dyspepsie und gesunden Probanden zu vergleichen. In Ubereinstimmung mit anderen fruheren Arbeiten findet sich bei Gesunden ein Anstieg viszeraler Wahrnehmungsschwellen nach repetitiver mechanischer Stimulation und Behandlung mit NSAR, wahrend die Schwellen bei Patienten mit funktioneller Dyspepsie abnehmen. Die Gabe von Naloxon, einem unspezifischen Opioidantagonisten, bewirkt bei Gesunden einen signifikant starker ausgepragten Abfall viszeraler Wahrnehmungsschwellen als bei Patienten. Die Daten lassen insofern den Schluss zu, dass \r\na) bei Patienten offensichtlich antinozizeptive Bahnen nur eingeschrankt funktionstuchtig sind; \r\nb) b) dies auf eine Storung opioiderg vermittelter antinozizeptiver Effekte zuruckzufuhren ist, was die verminderte Antwort auf intravenos appliziertes Naloxon bei Patienten nahe legt.",

Symptoms that may indicate hearing loss are buzzing or tinnitus, dizziness, balance problems, ear pain, or a feeling of a foreign object. It is important to check the hearing in newborns in order to react in time to possible irregularities. Symptoms of deafness in a child occur in the form of non-response to sounds and lack of interest in musical toys.

      "abstract": "Fatty acids are a major fuel for the body and fatty acid oxidation is particularly important during fasting, sustained aerobic exercise & stress. The myocardium and resting skeletal muscle utilise long-chain fatty acids as a major source of energy. Inherited disorders of fatty acid oxidation seriously compromise the function of muscle and other highly energy-dependent tissues such as brain, nerve, heart, kidney & liver. Defects of fatty acid oxidation lead to a range of neuromyopathic disease in both adults and children. Such defects encompass a wide spectrum of clinical disease, presenting in the neonatal period or infancy with recurrent hypoketotic hypoglycaemic encephalopathy, liver dysfunction and hyperammonaemia with neurosensory deficits secondary to the acute onset. In addition, there may be cardiac arrhythmias and/or progressive cardiomyopathy, which may give rise to secondary hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy. In older children, adolescence or adults there is often exercise intolerance with episodic myalgia or rhabdomyolysis in association with prolonged aerobic exercise or other exacerbating factors. Some disorders are particularly associated with toxic metabolites that may contribute to encephalopathy, polyneuropathy, axonopathy and pigmentary retinopathy. Diagnosis is through clinical suspicion with appropriate investigations in blood and urine taken during crisis. Definitive diagnosis is usually by fibroblast assay. Treatment is generally through avoidance of fasting, frequent carbohydrate rich feeds and in long-chain defects MCT supplementation. Novel treatments include the use of D,L-3-hydroxybutyrate and the potential use of fibrates to increase mutant protein levels in mild disorders.",

      "abstract": "Although psychosis is not one of the most commonly recognized psychiatric comorbidities of Eating Disorders (ED), there is an increasing empirical evidence of associations between these psychopathological conditions. Indeed, ED as well as early manifestations of schizophrenic psychosis emerge during developmental years and might present some affinities in the presentation at onset. For example, adolescents with anorexia nervosa (AN) may report psychotic-like eating-related symptoms such as delusional-like body image distortions and/or \"anorexic voice\". Conversely, early expressions of schizophrenia spectrum vulnerability might involve altered bodily experiences, delusional ideation on food and eating as well as pseudo-anorectic behaviors. From a phenomenological perspective, this partial symptomatic overlap may lie on common features of disturbed corporeality in terms of disembodiment, although these alterations of embodiment are presumably rooted in distinct pathogenetic pathways (e.g., primary childhood ontogenetic pathway in schizophrenia vs. a secondary adolescent ontogenetic pathway in AN). A clinical-phenomenological attitude could be important not only to better discern potential overlaps and affinities between the two conditions, but also to better conceptualize and treat those background alterations of the embodied self. In particular, a phenomenological exploration of the experiential side of eating-related behaviors could be a decisive step to support early differential diagnosis and treatment appropriateness.",

      "abstract": "The word frailty comes from the Latin term fragilitas, which refers to something weak, something that can be easily broken, ruined or destroyed.Frailty may vary depending on whether you are referring to an object or material, meaning little flexibility in its concrete form or inability to change its shape, or to the symbolic meaning, in this case, in relation to abstract concepts, such as emotional, psychological or social weakness.At present, in the field of medicine, frailty may be defined as a complex biological disorder with decreased endurance and functional reserve, resulting in a greater vulnerability to adverse health conditions.Frailty is not necessarily a disability disorder, but they are not exclusive.This concept has been widely studied in the elderly population as an apparent state of frailty under stress, mainly associated with aging, which affects homeostasis. 1 In order to understand the starting points of this disorder, it is critical to identify the individuals at risk in advance so that intervention efforts are targeted at the most affected components.This concept can be clearly implemented in adults and also in children with chronic conditions, as is the case of children with liver disease, whose severe alterations may involve their nutrition, endocrine system, immune status, and cognitive development.",

      "title": "Diagnostic Tools for Insomnia",
      "abstract": "In a general sense, insomnia suggests inadequate sleep quality or quantity when one has an adequate opportunity to sleep. When defined as a sleep disorder, insomnia is characterized by difficulty falling asleep or remaining asleep, which may represent problems with sleep maintenance or early morning awakening despite attempts to be sleeping. Sleep disorder nosologies also may include a complaint of nonrefreshing sleep as an insomnia complaint. For a diagnosis of an insomnia disorder to be made, daytime consequences or functional impairment also should be present. These may include fatigue, inability to concentrate, or irritability. Insomnia may be characterized as primary or comorbid (1). Primary insomnia occurs independently while comorbid insomnia presumably is associated with a sleep disturbance related to another disorder. Insomnia affects approximately 30% of the general population at least occasionally and is a severe or chronic problem for about 10% of the population. Patients with co-occurring conditions have significantly increased risk for insomnia (2). People suffering with insomnia have increased healthcare costs and utilize health resources to a greater extent. They also have worse scores on quality-of-life measures. Persistent insomnia has been identified as a risk factor for the development or exacerbation of certain psychiatric and medical conditions. Overall, insomnia represents a significant socioeconomic burden both for individuals and for society. This chapter will provide an overview of current perspectives on the causes, consequences, and associations of insomnia.ETIOLOGY, PATHOPHYSIOLOGY, AND PATHOGENESIS",

IBS could be corelated with Grahani, a condition caused by the dysfunction of the digestive system due to an imbalance of Agni (digestive fire) based on the homology of symptoms of both. Grahani, the seat of digestion and assimilation, becomes impaired by factors such as stress, improper diet, irregular eating habits, and lifestyle disturbances, leading to improper digestion, irregular bowel movements, and systemic manifestations. The vitiation of Vata and Pitta doshas plays a crucial role in the pathophysiology of this condition.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Individuals who complain of insomnia report repeated difficulty with either initially falling asleep (sleep onset insomnia) or remaining asleep (sleep maintenance insomnia) despite adequate opportunity, condition, and time for sleep. Their sleep is described as short and inadequate, light and easily disrupted, of poor quality, unrefreshing, unsatisfactory, or nonrestorative. Frequent extended periods of wakefulness or persistent early morning awakenings may be reported. In children, insomnia may present as bedtime resistance or lack of ability to sleep independently. This sleep disturbance is associated with impairment of daytime function. Most investigators define insomnia as a sleep latency of 30 minutes or more; wake time after sleep onset of 30 minutes or more; sleep efficiency of less than 85%; or total sleep time less than 6 to 6.5 hours, occurring at least 3 nights a week. Patients with insomnia often report greater subjective sleep disturbance compared to objective polysomnographic parameters. The discrepancy between subjective estimates and objective measures of sleep is believed to be due to persistent sensory processing during non–rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, which decreases the ability of patients with insomnia to distinguish sleep from wakefulness. Perception of sleep appears to be altered. Persons with insomnia may have a greater tendency to describe, when awakened from sleep, of being awake all along, compared with those without insomnia. In addition, they may overestimate the duration of their sleep latencies.",

Identification of treatable aetiologies, such as biochemical/metabolic disturbance (e.g. electrolyte imbalance, acid–base disturbance), dehydration and benign upper gastrointestinal tract disease (e.g. ulcers), can prove very effective. For those problems without obvious solutions, optimization of symptom control is paramount: analgesia anti-emetics (Chapter 14), anti-diarrhoeals, laxatives, chlorpromazine (for hiccoughs) and rationalization of drug therapy, where possible, are a brief list of areas that may need to be addressed. There are also some treatment options for appetite stimulation and cancer cachexia (see Part 3), and psychological help is often required, which most oncology centres can access.",

      "abstract": "A variety of disorders—including infectious, inflammatory, hereditary, and metabolic diseases—may affect both the brain and abdominal cavity, and the findings in one region may help establish the diagnosis or limit the differential diagnosis. Establishing an accurate early diagnosis enables clinicians to adequately manage these unusual diseases and potentially avert life-threatening complications. For example, an early diagnosis of Gardner syndrome enables annual sigmoid- or colonoscopy and ultrasonography. In many conditions, abdominal manifestations precede neurologic manifestations and may have prognostic significance. Patients with celiac disease more often present with abdominal manifestations such as duodenitis, slow transit time, reversal of the jejunal-ileal fold pattern, and transient small bowel intussusception than with intracranial manifestations. In other conditions, the neurologic manifestations may be the same as the presenting symptoms. For example, patients with Gardner syndrome may initially present with multiple mandibular or sinonasal osteomas. In addition, sarcoidosis may manifest with multifocal enhancing dural masses. Abdominal and neurologic manifestations may even occur simultaneously, as in several of the phakomatoses such as neurofibromatosis type 1, tuberous sclerosis complex, and von Hippel–Lindau syndrome. Ultimately, familiarity with the appearances of these conditions allows radiologists to pinpoint a diagnosis, even when imaging findings in either location are nonspecific.",

      "abstract": "La menopausia es la interrupción definitiva de las menstruaciones resultado de la pérdida de la actividad folicular del ovario. El periodo inmediatamente antes de la menopausia y el primer año después de la misma se conoce como perimenopausia. La posmenopausia se define como el periodo que transcurre desde un año a partir de la fecha de última menstruación, sin importar si la menopausia fue inducida o espontánea. Debido al incremento de la esperanza de vida en la mujer mexicana, mayor número de ellas alcanzan la edad promedio de la menopausia (45-59 años) y pasan una parte significativa de su vida en la posmenopausia. Se ha observado que los trastornos psiquiátricos son más frecuentes en mujeres que en hombres, y que la perimenopausia es una etapa en la cual se incrementan los síntomas psicológicos, así como el riesgo de sufrir depresión mayor y trastornos de ansiedad. Se debe diferenciar cuando la ansiedad es un síntoma normal ante determinadas situaciones cotidianas de estrés y cuando comienza a tener una presentación irracional por un estímulo ausente, por una intensidad excesiva con relación al estímulo, o cuando la duración es prolongada y presenta recidivas sin motivo, ocasionando grave disfuncionalidad en el paciente. En esta revisión presentamos datos acerca de los síntomas de ansiedad durante la transición a la menopausia y hacemos alusión al trastorno de ansiedad generalizada y trastorno de pánico, ya que se ha observado una mayor prevalencia de estas patologías durante la transición a la menopausia, probablemente debido a los cambios hormonales que se viven durante esta etapa. Menopause is the cessation of menses as a result of loss of ovarian follicular activity. The period before menopause and the first year after menopause is known as peri-menopause. Post-menopause is defined as the years after menopause, regardless of whether it was induced or spontaneous. Due to increased life expectancy in Mexican women, as many reach the average age of menopause at 45-59 years, they spend a significant part of their lives in post-menopause. It has been observed that psychiatric disorders are more common in women than in men, and that peri-menopause is a stage when the risk of psychological symptoms increases, as well as the risk of major depression and anxiety disorders. It must be determined when anxiety arises as a normal state in response to specific daily stress provoking situations, or whether anxiety starts to present itself irrationally as part of a psychiatric disorder. In this review we present data on anxiety during menopausal transition. Reference is also made to general anxiety disorder and panic disorder, due to their high prevalence in women during menopausal transition, probably attributed to hormonal changes during this stage.",

      "abstract": "Constipation in children is currently one of the major complaints that parents present at a pediatrician's appointment. The article discusses the issues of diagnosis and treatment of functional constipation in children based on the international and Russian clinical guidelines. The following are some major causes of constipation in young children. Constipation is most often caused by colon dyskinesia (hypo- and hypermotor disorders), impaired and painful bowel movement (spasm of the rectal sphincters, weakened smooth muscle tone, etc.) or a combination of these factors. In rare cases, the cause of constipation is organic disorders. Also, low parental socio-economic status, low educational level, depression, neuroticism, attitude of parents towards their children's upbringing such as being overprotective, and attitudes that promote high or low levels of autonomy, increase the risk of functional constipation. In addition, the article sets detailed factors leading to constipation in older children and adolescents. The pathogenesis of functional constipation is given, and the problem of psychological constipation is described. The outlined therapeutic approach includes dietary intervention, compliance with drinking water treatment, behavioural and drug therapy. The author presents its own experience of using sodium picosulfate to treat constipation in children. Constipation in children is a common problem, functional constipation accounts for 95% of cases, therefore in most cases they do not require clarifying diagnostic methods. Besides, you shouldn't forget about the possibility of organic pathology, malformations in young children. Constipation in children requires the timely administration of complex treatment.",

      "abstract": "Nausea and vomiting are common symptoms that can reduce quality of life and indicate life-threatening illness. Acute nausea and vomiting last up to 7 days. In the absence of alarm symptoms, they are typically treated symptomatically and without an extensive evaluation. Typical causes include gastroenteritis or other viral syndromes, foodborne illness, acute migraine headaches, vestibular disturbances, early pregnancy, and adverse effects of medication. Chronic nausea and vomiting last 4 weeks or longer and have a broad differential diagnosis. Causes can be gastrointestinal, infectious, metabolic, neurologic, psychiatric, or related to medications and toxins. A careful history of related factors is essential to guide the initial evaluation and narrow the differential diagnosis. These factors include associated symptoms, timing of onset and duration of symptoms, exacerbating or relieving factors, alarm symptoms, medication and substance use, relationship with recent food ingestion, and comorbidities. Nonpharmacologic management options include fluid and electrolyte replacement; small, frequent meals; and avoidance of trigger foods. Antiemetic drugs effectively reduce symptoms of acute nausea and vomiting, but chronic symptoms are often more challenging to treat. When a specific etiology is not identified, a serotonin antagonist or dopamine antagonist can be used. However, medications may also target the suspected cause of symptoms and the neurotransmitters involved in central and peripheral pathways of nausea and vomiting. Pharmacologic therapy should be used for the shortest time necessary to control symptoms.",

      "title": "177 The Esophagus",
      "abstract": "Achalasia is a motor disorder of the esophagus character- ized by functional obstruction, aperistalsis, and incom- plete relaxation of the lower esophageal sphincter in response to swallowing and increased lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure. The disease manifests itself usu- ally in late childhood and early adult life. However, acha- lasia has been recognized in all ages including infancy. Esophageal achalasia is a well-known pathology described in families with more than one affected siblings. The exact cause of achalasia remains unknown. Genetic factors were suggested to play a role in the pathogenesis, and some authors considered it an autosomal recessive character. Other report suggested that the defect could be neurogenic, myogenic, or hormonal in origin. Clinical Features Difficulty in swallowing, dysphagia, and regurgitation of retained food inthe esophagusduring orafter mealarethe main complaints. Achalasia is usually presented with dys- phagia (usually to solids) and vomiting. Affected patients are therefore slow eaters and slow swallowers. Vomiting of foodremnantswithinability toeatandfailuretothriveare other well-recognized findings. Aspiration pneumonia, regurgitation, respiratory difficulties, choking, and sud- den death have also been reported in achalasia. The onset is insidious with fluctuation of symptoms especially during the early stages of the disease. At a later age, the child may complain of a choking sensation of food sticking in the region of the lower sternum. The child will at a later stage get the habits of drinking water or adopting certain maneuvers to facilitate the passage of food bolus and ease his symptoms. Vomiting which may occur hours after meal is usually associated with the presence of undigested food eaten several hours ago. Aspiration pneumonia and repeated chest infections may complicate recurrent episodes of vomiting. Later recognized complications include malnutrition and failure to thrive. Diagnosis Clinical history contributes greatly to the suspicion of achalasia in an index case. Plain chest radiograph may show dilated food-filled esophagus with an air-fluid level. Radiologic signs of recurrent aspiration pneumonia further support the diagnosis, which is usually confirmed on barium swallow and fluoroscopy. The esophagus is dilated and sometimes tortuous, with absence of stripping waves, uncoordinated contraction, and obstruction at the gastroesophageal junctionwith prolonged retention of the barium inthe esophagus(>Fig. 177.1).The classicrat-tail deformity of funneling and narrowing of the distal esoph- agus is a result of failure of relaxation of the lower esoph- ageal sphincter (LES). Manometric intraluminal pressure studies, when available, should be performed to confirm the diagnosis. Esophagoscopy is performed to exclude any other associated anomalies.",

      "title": "Male urinary incontinence.",
      "abstract": "This article will describe the diagnosis and management of different causes of male urinary incontinence, with a focus on the most common type of male incontinence, post-prostatectomy incontinence. Urinary incontinence can be broadly divided into stress urinary incontinence (SUI), urge incontinence (UI) and overflow incontinence. SUI is loss of urine during physical exertion that increases intra-abdominal pressure, overcoming urethral sphincteric resistance. UI is associated with an overactive bladder, in which an urge to void or involuntary bladder contraction occurs at a volume less than capacity. UI is simply involuntary loss of urine associated with this urge to urinate (sensory UI) or involuntary bladder contraction (motor UI). Motor UI is seen in detrusor instability (caused by bladder outlet obstruction, bladder mucosal inflammation or tumor, or pelvic nerve injury) or detrusor hyperreflexia (caused by an upper motor neuron lesion, such as a brain lesion or spinal cord injury). Sensory UI is associated with increased bladder sensation but no actual detrusor contraction and can be seen in all types of overactive bladder, especially intersititial cystitis. Overflow incontinence is associated with urinary retention secondary to bladder outlet obstruction or detrusor failure and occurs when bladder capacity is exceeded. Mixed incontinence, usually a combination of SUI and UI is a common clinical finding. Most often, significant male urinary incontinence is iatrogenic SUI directly related to surgery of the prostate and is known as post-prostatectomy incontinence (PPI). By far, the most common surgical procedure associated with PPI is radical removal of a cancerous prostate (radical retropubic prostatectomy or RRP). Much less commonly, PPI can occur following surgical relief of prostatic obstruction, such as transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) or open prostatectomy. Non-iatrogenic causes of male incontinence include UI or overflow incontinence as described above. In elderly males, the most common causes of UI include detrusor instability secondary to chronic bladder outlet obstruction, and less commonly detrusor hyperreflexia secondary to stroke or Parkinsonis disease.",

      "abstract": "Velopharyngeal dysfunction (VPD) refers to any situation in which an individual is unable to completely close the nasal airway during speech.The velopharyngeal mechanism is comprised of a complex group of structures that act in unison to control airflow through the nose and mouth by elevation of the soft palate and constriction of both the lateral and posterior pharyngeal walls (►Fig. 1).Any disruption in this mechanism may result in abnormal, poorly intelligible speech.VPD can manifest as hypernasality, nasal emission, decreased vocal intensity, and/or facial grimacing. 1Moreover, patients who suffer from VPD will frequently develop maladaptive articulations to compensate for their speech difficulties. 2umerous etiologies can be responsible for this failure of normal speech production.Myoneurogenic problems can impair muscle control or affect muscle programming.Anatomic irregularities can present as a tissue deficit, structural problems that affect function, or even mechanical interference preventing normal closure.Mislearning comprises a host of etiologies whereby the patient has developed abnormal usage of the velopharyngeal mechanism despite the absence of other pathology. 3elopharyngeal dysfunction is a carefully chosen term that simply denotes the presence of incomplete velopharyngeal closure without making suggestions as to its cause.Use of this nomenclature has gained increasing favor by experts, replacing the previous designation, velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI).This helps to avoid confusion, as VPI has been differentially interpreted as denoting insufficiency, incompetence, and inadequacy-terms that may be similar, but are not synonymous and potentially implicate the cause of the dysfunction rather than describe the clinical finding.VPD is seen in roughly 20 to 30% of individuals who have undergone cleft palate repair, 4,5 and 5 to 10% of patients with a submucous cleft palate (SMCP). 6",

      "abstract": "Dyspepsia, defined as pain or discomfort centered in the upper abdomen, affects an estimated 25% of the U.S. population each year; accounts for up to 5% of all visits to primary care physicians, and generates over $1.3 billion in prescription drug costs annually. In the majority of patients evaluated, no clear cause of symptoms can be identified, and the condition is termed functional or nonulcer dyspepsia (NUD). The pathophysiology of NUD remains unclear, but disturbances in gastrointestinal motility or sensation are often found. Clinically, NUD can be subdivided into dysmotility-like (in which discomfort, fullness, bloating, early satiety, or nausea [but not pain] predominate) or ulcer-like (in which epigastric pain is predominant). In ulcer-like NUD, antisecretory therapy is useful, but in dysmotility-like NUD, acid suppression is not superior to placebo. Cisapride accelerates gastric emptying and enhances gastric accommodation but probably does not blunt perception. Although cisapride relieves symptoms of dyspepsia without the adverse central nervous system effects often associated with metoclopramide, its cardiac toxicity has led to disuse. Antidepressants are of uncertain efficacy but are widely used. New prokinetics and other enteric neuromodulating agents are being tested in NUD and are likely to find an important place in clinical practice in the future.",

      "title": "Urology",
      "abstract": "The topics in this chapter are as follows: Bedwetting (Nocturnal enuresis = NE), Frequent urination, Dysuria and Polyuria. Bedwetting Misdiagnosis is due to failing to differentiate between monosymptomatic and complicated NE, and failing to recognize other causes of nocturnal enuresis, blood in urine, dysuria, and polyuria. Bedwetting presents either in isolation (monosymptomatic enuresis = MSE) or in association with urinary tract infection (UTI), vulvovaginitis, daytime incontinence, urge, hesitancy, straining symptoms of urination, postvoid dribbling or dysfunctional voiding (non-monosymptomatic enuresis = NMSE). NE is divided into primary nocturnal enuresis (PNE) and secondary nocturnal enuresis (SNE) (restarting bedwetting after a previous dry period >6 months) in 20% of children. The chapter discusses diagnostic criteria of monosymptomatic NE and differentiating it from other conditions causing nocturnal enuresis including compulsive drinking, type 1 diabetes and diabetes insipidus. Blood in urine Misdiagnosis is due to failing to differentiate blood from other blood-appearing substances in the urine, failing to recognize pathologies causing blood in urine in neonates, and in older children. When a child presents with blood in urine, doctors should determine that it is actually haematuria? Red staining of the nappy can be due to either true blood with RBCs or urates. Haemorrhagic disease of the newborn should be excluded. Nephrocalcinosis is not uncommon in premature babies and it can be seen in up to 40 days of life. The detection of proteinuria in association with haematuria is very suggestive of renal origin of the haematuria such as glomerulonephritis. Pathologies causing haematuria in older children include post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis, which is the most common cause of gross haematuria worldwide. Other topics discussed include urinary tract infection; renal stones, Henoch–Schönlein purpura, renal tumour. Nephroblastoma is the most common urological malignancy in children. Schistosomiasis occurs in many countries, e.g. Egypt. Frequent urination Misdiagnosis is due to failing to establish characteristics of frequent urination and differentiating it from continuous urination and polyuria. The term indicates frequent urination more than 7–8 times a day in older children, The condition needs to be differentiated from continuous dribbling due to posterior urethral valve obstruction in boys, and ectopic ureter in girls. Diagnostic criteria of both conditions are discussed. Dysuria Misdiagnosis is due to failing to recognize that dysuria can exist in infancy, failing to establish common underlying causes of painful urination Dysuria in infancy: Painful urination may occur due to urethritis caused by infection, as idiopathic urethritis, hypercalciuria, or part of Reiter's syndrome (associated with conjunctivitis, polyarthritis), or due to nappy dermatitis affecting the foreskin of the penis. Underlying causes of dysuria in older children are discussed. Urinary incontinence Misdiagnosis is due to failing to consider basic knowledge on urinary incontinence, and failing to establish important secondary causes of urinary incontinence. Basic knowledge of urinary incontinence and their underlying causes of urinary are discussed. Labial fusion is another cause and is common affecting about 3% of pre-pubertal girls Polyuria Misdiagnosis is due to failing to define the diagnosis of polyuria, to differentiate the main causes of polyuria, including diabetes, compulsive drinking, diabetes insipidus, renal tubular acidosis and hypercalcaemia. Polyuria in children results from either a water or solute diuresis. Polydipsia indicates excessive water intake, which is defined in this section. Diagnostic criteria of diabetes type 1 and diabetes insipidus (DI) are discussed. The most important differential diagnosis is between compulsive drinking and DI. Diagnostic criteria of compulsive drinking and renal tubular acidosis are provided. Urinary Retention/inability to pass urine Misdiagnosis is due to failing to distinguish oliguria and anuria from urine retention, and not differentiating the main causes of urine retention. Urine retention indicates an inability to empty the bladder for >12 h with a normal or increased urine volume, or a palpable distended bladder. Causes include bladder neck or urethral obstruction. Oliguria in infants is a urine output of <0.5 mL/kg/h per 24 h. In older children and adults oliguria is <400/day. This quantity (usually resulting from dehydration in children) is insufficient to excrete the daily osmolar load. Causes of reduced urine output or retention in neonates and in older children are discussed.",

A report by the Institute of Medicine1 identified medication nonadherence as a notable source of medical errors.\r\n\r\nPoor adherence has been shown to decrease the effects of prescribed medications or other treatments and to increase the likelihood of poor outcomes.2 Adherence has been related to intermediate clinical outcomes in several diseases. An increased incidence of adverse events has been linked to nonadherence in the elderly.3\r\n\r\nElders' adherence to prescribed medications is a complex phenomenon that depends on an interaction of medical, medication, personal, and economic factors.\r\n\r\n\r\nMedical factors that affect adherence include cognitive abilities, as well as overall health status (eg, number of chronic conditions).\r\n\r\n\r\nMedication factors related to adherence include the characteristics of the medication (eg, dosing frequency or presence of side effects).\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonal factors that affect adherence include: \r\n\r\npersonal beliefs about the condition for which the medication is prescribed (eg, how serious the condition is and how likely the medication is to have a positive effect).\r\n\r\n\r\nindividual cognitive abilities, including memory, overall intellectual ability, organization skills, and health literacy.

      "title": "72 Velopharyngeal Dysfunction",
      "abstract": "Velopharyngeal dysfunction (VPD) refers to any situation in which an individual is unable to completely close the nasal airway during speech.The velopharyngeal mechanism is comprised of a complex group of structures that act in unison to control airflow through the nose and mouth by elevation of the soft palate and constriction of both the lateral and posterior pharyngeal walls (►Fig. 1).Any disruption in this mechanism may result in abnormal, poorly intelligible speech.VPD can manifest as hypernasality, nasal emission, decreased vocal intensity, and/or facial grimacing. 1Moreover, patients who suffer from VPD will frequently develop maladaptive articulations to compensate for their speech difficulties. 2umerous etiologies can be responsible for this failure of normal speech production.Myoneurogenic problems can impair muscle control or affect muscle programming.Anatomic irregularities can present as a tissue deficit, structural problems that affect function, or even mechanical interference preventing normal closure.Mislearning comprises a host of etiologies whereby the patient has developed abnormal usage of the velopharyngeal mechanism despite the absence of other pathology. 3elopharyngeal dysfunction is a carefully chosen term that simply denotes the presence of incomplete velopharyngeal closure without making suggestions as to its cause.Use of this nomenclature has gained increasing favor by experts, replacing the previous designation, velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI).This helps to avoid confusion, as VPI has been differentially interpreted as denoting insufficiency, incompetence, and inadequacy-terms that may be similar, but are not synonymous and potentially implicate the cause of the dysfunction rather than describe the clinical finding.VPD is seen in roughly 20 to 30% of individuals who have undergone cleft palate repair, 4,5 and 5 to 10% of patients with a submucous cleft palate (SMCP). 6",

Chronic constipation may accompany or be a symptom of some general organic or functional morbid process, or it may exist as an independent affection. Inability of the bowel to empty itself depends of course on a disturbance of some part of the mechanism involved in defecation. The essential physiology of the impulse to defecation and the factors on which it depends are but imperfectly understood.

      "abstract": "The hallucinogens are a class of psychoactive drugs, either synthetic or plant products, that produce auditory and/or visual hallucinations as well as thought, mood, and perceptual changes. Depending on dosage, expectation (set), and environment (setting), they also can induce euphoria and a state similar to a transcendental experience. These hallucinations can be present as part of a delirium (e.g., from jimsonweed [ Datura stramonium ]) when accompanied by disturbances in judgment, orientation, intellect, memory, and emotion. Delirium also can result from drug withdrawal (e.g., associated with sedative-hypnotic and/or alcohol withdrawal). When used in the context of substance abuse, the term hallucinogen generally refers to a compound that alters consciousness without producing delirium, sedation, excessive stimulation, or impairment of intellect or memory. Hallucinogens that are abused include the prototype hallucinogen d -lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD); other indolealkylamines such as psilocybin (\"magic mushrooms\") and dimethyltryptamine (DMT, also contained in the South American beverage ayahuasca); and the phenalkylamines, including mescaline and dimethoxymethylamphetamine (DOM, also called STP). LSD, DMT, DOM, psilocybin, and mescaline are sometimes characterized as serotonergic hallucinogens on account of their predominant effect on that receptor system. Other plant products with hallucinogenic activity that are abused include the seeds of the morning glory ( Ipomoea ), which contain lysergic acid derivatives, and seeds of the Hawaiian baby woodrose ( Argyreia nervosa ), which contain lysergic acid amide. Cannabinoid agonists; ≡ agonists; antimuscarinic agents; dissociative anesthetics such as phencyclidine (PCP); and designer drugs such as methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or ecstasy), which are sometimes classified as hallucinogens, are covered elsewhere in this volume.",

Bei dieser sehr haufigen Diagnose in der Gastroenterologie ist das Zusammenwirken somatischer, psychischer und sozialer Komponenten bei der Entstehung und im Verlauf des Beschwerdebildes besonders zu beachten. Typisch fur das RDS sind abdominelle Beschwerden, Stuhlunregelmasigkeiten, sowie das Fehlen von organpathologischen Befunden, die die Beschwerden ausreichend erklaren konnten. Viele Betroffene suchen wiederholt Hilfe bei gastroenterologischen Spezialisten oder Institutionen. Da dieses Beschwerdebild sehr beeintrachtigend und fur einen Teil der Betroffenen auch sehr beangstigend ist, weisen diese auch haufiger (in Spezialzentren uber 60 %) psychische Storungen auf. Der Anteil von PatientInnen mit irgendeiner Form von psychischer Stressbelastung oder Traumatisierung (psychisch, physisch oder sexuell) in der Anamnese ist groser als bei anderen „organischen“ Erkrankungen. Wenn die Beschwerden nicht ausreichend erklart und behandelt werden, fuhrt dies haufig zur Erhohung des Leidensdrucks und zu einer weiteren „Hilfesuche“ bei den Betroffenen. Dies hat auch gesundheitsokonomische Konsequenzen mit Kostensteigerungen. Die Integration psychosozialer Faktoren im diagnostischen Prozess und eine psychosomatische Betreuung der RDS-PatientInnen sind daher besonders wichtig. Stichworter: Reizdarmsyndrom, viszerale Hypersensitivitat, Psychosomatik, Hirn-Darm-Achse, bauchgerichtete Hypnosetherapie. The Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is part of the functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID), which were studied intensively within the last decades. In this very frequent diagnosis in Gastroenterology the interaction of somatic, psychic and social components in aetiology and the course of the illness should be especially considered. Typical symptoms in IBS are abdominal complaints, irregular bowel movements and lack of pathological findings, which could explain sufficiently the symptoms. Many patients seek repeatedly help from gastroenterological specialists and institutions. Since the illness is very impairing, and for some also terrifying, these patients show more frequent psychological disturbances (in tertiary centres more than 60 %). The proportion of patients with any kind of stress or abuse (psychological, physical or sexual) in their history is greater in IBS than in other “organic” diseases. If the symptoms are not sufficiently explained and / or treated, the suffering and health care seeking of IBS patients leads to health-economic consequences with increasing costs. Therefore the integration of psychosocial factors in the diagnostic process and the psychosomatic care of patients with IBS are very important.",

      "abstract": "![][1]</img> This article is part of a new initiative in Evidence-based Mental Health, namely the serialisation of chapters of Clinical Evidence (a summary of the best available evidence on common clinical interventions updated regularly by the BMJ Publishing Group). This article is based on material presented in: Kumar S, Oakley-Browne M. Panic disorder. Clinical Evidence 2002; 8: 1003–9. For this review, Clinical Evidence searched and appraised material published until May 2002. Studies with follow up periods of less than 6 months were excluded. A panic attack is a period in which there is sudden onset of intense apprehension, fearfulness or terror, often associated with feelings of impending doom. Panic disorder occurs when there are recurrent, unpredictable attacks followed by at least 1 month of persistent concern about having another panic attack; worry about the possible implications or consequences of the panic attacks, or a significant behavioural change related to the attacks.1 The term “panic disorder” excludes panic attacks attributable to the direct physiological effects of a general medical condition, substance or another mental disorder. Panic disorder is sometimes categorised as “with” or “without agoraphobia.”1 Alternative categorisations focus on phobic anxiety disorders and specify agoraphobia with or without panic disorder.2 Panic disorder often starts around 20 years of age (between late adolescence and the mid-30s).3 Lifetime prevalence is 1–3%, and panic disorder is more common in women than in men.4 An Australian community study found 1 month prevalence rates for panic disorder (with or without agoraphobia) of 0.4% using International Classification of … [1]: /embed/graphic-1.gif",

      "title": "Nocturnal Enuresis: Current Concepts",
      "abstract": "Objectives After completing this article, readers should be able to: Nocturnal enuresis affects approximately 5 to 7 million children in the United States, making it the most common pediatric urologic complaint encountered by primary care physicians. Despite its prevalence, nocturnal enuresis remains incompletely understood, which can frustrate patients, family members, and physicians. Appropriate intervention is justified for the affected child because of the potential consequences of family stress, social withdrawal, and poor self-esteem.Enuresis refers to the persistence of inappropriate voiding of urine beyond the age of anticipated bladder control (age 4 to 5 y at the latest). The development of bladder control is a multidimensional process that requires sensory awareness of bladder fullness by the child, capacity for storage of urine, voluntary control of the bladder sphincter, psychological desire for control, and a positive training experience. Diurnal enuresis is involuntary leaking of urine during waking hours. Nocturnal enuresis refers to involuntary passage of urine during sleep and is classified as primary (no prior period of sustained dryness) or secondary (recurrence of nighttime wetting after 6 mo or longer of dryness). Recent urology literature describes another classification of nocturnal enuresis based on the presence or absence of other bladder symptoms. Monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis (MNE) is defined as a normal void occurring at night in bed in the absence of any other symptoms referable to the urogenital tract, and it precludes any daytime symptomatology. It is the focus of this article. Polysymptomatic nocturnal enuresis (PNE) is bed-wetting associated with other bladder symptoms such as urgency, frequency,instability, or voiding dysfunction. Investigations of patients who have MNE reveal that they are clearly different from patients who have PNE.The spontaneous resolution rate of nocturnal enuresis is approximately 15% per year, with 1% of teenagers at 15 years of age still wetting the bed (Fig. 1). Parents may become concerned about nocturnal enuresis when their child reaches 5 to 6 years of age and is preparing to enter school. Most children are not concerned until 7 to 8 years of age. Approximately 80% to 85% of children who have nocturnal enuresis have MNE. Another 5% to 10% of cases meet the definition of PNE, with daytime wetting or other bladder symptoms. Organic causes are responsible for nocturnal enuresis in fewer than 5% of cases. Such organic causes must be searched for and ruled out if the history suggests their presence. There is a slight male predominance (about 60% overall) for nocturnal enuresis. Etiologic factors contributing to MNE include genetics, sleep arousal dysfunction,urodynamics, nocturnal polyuria, psychological components, and maturational delay. That the condition probably is multifactorial, with various contributing factors in any one patient, confounds attempts to base therapeutic approaches on etiology.A hereditary basis for nocturnal enuresis has been suspected for years. Studies of twins show a concordance rate of 43% to 68% for monozygotic and 19% to 36% for dizygotic twins. Seventy percent of children who have enuresis have a parent who has a history of the disorder. Studies indicate that if one parent had enuresis, the probability of a child having it is approximately 40% to 45%. If both parents were affected, the probability of a child having the condition increases to 70% to 77%. If neither parent had enuresis, only 15% of offspring will have enuresis. Chromosomes 12q, 13q, and 22 all have been named as possible locations of a gene(s) resulting in enuresis, but a specific mechanism for enuresis related to a gene locus is not known.The association between the presence of a full bladder and the sensation in the brain of a full bladder occurs in most children by the age of 5 years,which correlates with the normative standard in the United States for nocturnal dryness in 85% of 5-year-olds. Concurrently, by this age the child's pattern of several sleep/wake cycles daily, known as multiphasic sleep, has changed to a single period of sleep daily, known as monophasic sleep. Daytime urination control usually occurs first,followed by learning to arouse during sleep to the sensation of a full bladder. Many parents report that a child who has enuresis is more difficult to arouse from sleep than are other children in the home, but sleep studies have not documented a convincing association between a child's sound sleep and a nocturnal wetting episode.The relationship of sleep patterns with enuresis is an area of active research. In some studies, the enuretic event seemed to occur during nonREM sleep and could occur during any part of the night. In others,enuresis reportedly was caused by a mild disturbance in arousal, based on the finding that activation of the arousal center proceeded correctly, but the transition from light sleep to complete awakening was not achieved properly. In a subset of patients, the arousal center in the brain failed to activate, despite proper full bladder sensation. There is conflicting evidence that children who have enuresis may exhibit other parasomnias, such as sleepwalking and night terrors. A recurrent theme in sleep research is the child's inability to recognize the sensation of a full bladder during sleep and failure to awaken from sleep to urinate in an appropriate place. There appears to be a maturational pattern of progressive central nervous system \"recognition\" of bladder fullness and control over the micturition reflex.Some children who have enuresis may have a small bladder capacity. Functional bladder capacity in children may be estimated by the formula: age in years plus 2, which gives bladder capacity in ounces. By adolescence, this no longer applies; adult bladder capacity is approximately 10 to 15 oz. Children who have small bladder capacities probably represent a subgroup of patients who have MNE and presumably cannot hold the normal amount of urine produced at night. They are more likely to report frequent daytime voiding,some nights with multiple episodes of enuresis per night, and no history of attaining dryness.In some children who have normal bladder capacities,urgency may play a role in nocturnal enuresis. These children exhibit daytime urgency, but they can maintain bladder control during the day. They have a pattern of partial emptying of the bladder that results in frequent daytime urination to maintain continence and enuresis occurring at night when they cannot void as often. No evidence supports abnormal urodynamics in children who have MNE. Involuntary nighttime voiding in those who have MNE occurs with a urodynamically normal bladder at functional capacity. Because most patients who have abnormal urodynamics as an underlying cause for their nighttime enuresis also have daytime symptoms, asking patients about daytime voiding patterns in the initial history is important.Polyuria is defined as excessive urine production. It may be associated with chronic illnesses such as diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus. Caffeine,alcohol, and medications also may cause it. Factors such as irregular food and drink intake and staying up late also may contribute. It seems reasonable to limit fluid intake several hours prior to bedtime because the most common cause of polyuria is habit polydipsia.Since first described in 1985, the theory that MNE is due to nocturnal polyuria with relative nocturnal deficiency of pituitary-produced antidiuretic hormone(ADH) has been controversial. Early studies reported that the plasma level of ADH did not increase during sleep in those who had enuresis compared with a rise in ADH among unaffected children, resulting in relative nocturnal polyuria as a factor in enuresis. Studies documenting the percentage of children who have enuresis and lack a nocturnal surge in ADH ranges from 25% to 100%, suggesting the presence of other factors. New research about polyuria and enuresis theorizes that a full bladder might communicate with the kidneys to reduce urine production. Some recent investigations also suggest abnormal osmoregulatory function in the kidney, with higher solute excretion among those who have enuresis.Most children who have enuresis have no psychological disorder. The dated concept that enuresis frequently is due to anxiety or stress is unproven. On the contrary, enuresis creates psychosocial problems for the bed-wetting child, including poor self-esteem,family stress, and social isolation. Secondary enuresis commonly has been attributed to psychological factors. Recent studies show no major psychological differences between children who have secondary enuresis and children who have no enuresis. If a child reverts to bed-wetting during treatment for enuresis or has increased episodes of bed-wetting during times of stress, it is more likely due to poor compliance with treatment. Children who have enuresis not only have lower self-esteem than unaffected children, but they have lower self-esteem than children who have chronic,debilitating illnesses. These study results both emphasize the profound impact that enuresis may have and justify a careful evaluation of psychosocial symptoms in the family and the patient.The fact that most children who have enuresis become dry in time with or without intervention supports maturational delay as a factor in MNE. At age 5 years,15% of children occasionally wet the bed compared with only 10% at 6 years of age. Perhaps development of central nervous system recognition of and response to the sensation of a full bladder is delayed, a concept that correlates strongly with the arousal dysfunction theory. Proposed abnormal urodynamic factors also may normalize as the child becomes older. A similar process of maturation over time is seen in other milestones of normal development,such as the age range of 9 to 15 months at which a child begins to walk. Maturational delay may be the most plausible and unifying concept among proposed etiologic factors in MNE.In addition to a detailed toilet training history, a family history of enuresis should be sought because it rarely is volunteered, even when known by a parent. Other pertinent details of a history include the onset and pattern of wetting, voiding behavior, sleep pattern, parasomnias, medical conditions, daytime urinary symptoms, bowel habits, and psychosocial factors. It also is important to assess both the family's and the patient's attitude toward the bed-wetting and their readiness to initiate and continue treatment. Questions about voiding patterns may reveal urgency or a history of small, frequent voids that suggests bladder instability or small bladder capacity. Organic causes of enuresis may be apparent by a history of dysuria (urinary tract infection),polyuria and polydipsia (diabetes insipidus or mellitus), encopresis (constipation), abnormal urine stream (lower obstructive lesions), gait disturbances(spinal cord pathology), or nighttime snoring(adenoidal hypertrophy). A thorough and thoughtful history is the means by which the infrequent organic causes of enuresis are separated from the majority of cases that have no organic etiology (TableT1). Most children who have nocturnal enuresis will have normal findings on physical examination. In addition to assessing the child's height, weight, and blood pressure, perform a complete examination, paying careful attention to the urogenital, neurologic, and gastrointestinal systems. A palpable bladder or palpable stool may be present on abdominal examination, ectopic ureter or signs of sexual abuse on urogenital examination, or abnormal gait apparent during neurologic examination. Cremasteric, anal, abdominal,and deep tendon reflexes that reflect spinal cord function all should be tested. The skin of the lower back should be inspected for the presence of a sacral dimple, hair patches, or vascular birthmarks, which can be clues to spinal dysraphism. Mouth breathing may suggest sleep apnea with associated enuresis due to adenoidal hypertrophy. Direct observation of the urinary stream in the office is important, especially if findings on the history suggest an abnormality. The family can measure bladder capacity at home prior to the initial evaluation or it can be measured in the office by having the child drink 12 oz of fluid on arrival, then voiding into a calibrated cup.All children who have enuresis should have urinalysis of a clean-catch midstream urine specimen (Fig 2). The ability to concentrate urine to 1.015 or greater rules out diabetes insipidus and the absence of glucose rules out diabetes mellitus as causes of nocturnal enuresis. Further laboratory testing is unnecessary for MNE. A urine culture should be obtained for symptoms suggestive of urinary tract infection on history or findings on urinalysis. Routine radiologic or ultrasonographic imaging studies of the urinary tract or cystoscopy are not recommended for children who have MNE. PNE may require further evaluation with voiding cystourethrography (VCUG), renal and bladder ultrasonography, or urodynamic testing. When enuresis is resistant to treatment and the history suggests a sleep disorder, a sleep study may be useful to look for sleep apnea or parasomnias.An important factor in any pediatric treatment is the child's motivation and acceptance. Parents also must support the child and the treatment program for maximal effectiveness. The child's age is a critical factor when formulating a treatment plan. Consideration of treatment is guided by the clinician's understanding of the changing prevalence of enuresis in school-age children and the effect of enuresis on the child's self-esteem and family function. Timing of the intervention should be tailored to the individual child and family.Although a child's self-esteem can be harmed by MNE, even at early school age, the effects are variable. Some school-age children and their parents are not bothered by the child's enuresis; others experience anxiety and stress. It is reasonable to discuss MNE during a health supervision visit and provide facts for families of patients at 6 or 7 years of age. The maturational aspects of nighttime awakening to void should be explained to parents and likened to other familiar developmental milestones that occur over a range of time rather than at a specific age. Providing plausible medical explanations, identifying a family history of enuresis, and defining its age-specific prevalence may lessen the burden on the child. Parents should understand that punishment or negative reinforcement is counterproductive, both in resolving the enuresis and in protecting the child's self-esteem. For children and families who are bothered by the child's enuresis,targeted intervention is recommended by age 8 years at the latest. In general, MNE should be thoroughly explained, selectively treated, and never ignored.This approach begins with educating parents and the child about enuresis, a process that usually allays guilt. Handouts with printed instructions can teach the parents and the child to manage the condition. Positive reinforcement can be initiated by setting up a diary or chart to monitor progress and establishing a system to reward the child for each night that he or she is dry. The child should be taken out of diapers or training pants and encouraged to empty the bladder completely prior to going to bed. The child should participate in morning cleanup as a natural, nonpunitive consequence of wetting. The risk of secondary psychological injury to the child's self-esteem is minimized by discouraging ridicule from siblings and by avoiding a critical, demoralizing approach.Because excessive fluid intake before bedtime can cause increased nocturnal urine production, as can caffeinated beverages and certain foods (eg, dairy products, citrus juices, chocolate), restricting fluids for 2 hours prior to bedtime is reasonable. The child should agree to fluid restriction, however, rather than having it imposed. The rate of complete resolution of enuresis with motivational therapy alone is estimated to be only 25%, but up to 70% of children who have MNE have some reduction in the number of wet nights. Once consistently dry nights are achieved, the reported relapse rate is low. Motivational therapy is a reasonable first-line approach, especially with the younger child. If unsuccessful after a trial of 3 to 6 months, a different treatment program should be considered.This approach includes dry-bed training and classic conditioning therapy using an enuresis alarm system. Hypnotherapy also may be part of a comprehensive program to treat enuresis. This therapy involves an age-appropriate explanation of how the brain and bladder communicate, taking the mystery out of enuresis by educating the patient and family, teaching relaxation techniques, and having the child practice imagery of awakening to urinate in the toilet or staying dry all night. It can be combined with an alarm system. Frequent office visits are required initially until the physician is certain that the child can practice imagery at home; then, visits may be monthly. Referral to a behavioral pediatrician or clinic may be necessary if the primary care physician does not have the necessary training or time for this approach.Dry-bed training (as described by Azrin and Thienes in 1978) involves waking the child on a progressive schedule at decreasing intervals over several nights,having the child change pajamas and bedding if wet or walk to the toilet when voiding is needed. As in the use of alarm therapy, the eventual goal is to have the child self-awaken to void. Although a high cure rate is reported with this technique by the authors, it is a more time- and labor-intensive process than most families are willing to undertake.Enuresis alarms have the highest overall cure rate of any available treatment. They also represent the best-researched behavioral intervention. Alarm systems can be used in combination with motivational and other behavioral therapy techniques or in combination with pharmacotherapy. Several different alarm devices range in cost from $50 to $75. Insurance companies may cover an enuresis alarm with a prescription from the physician describing it as a medical device. In contrast to the older bell-and-pad type of alarms, the new devices are portable, small,and worn directly on the child's clothing. They emit a transistorized audio or vibratory alarm when urine is sensed in the underpants.Alarms are most effective when combined with other behavioral or pharmacologic therapy. The alarm wakes the child or parent from sleep, who then implements the appropriate component of the behavioral program. The alarm allows the parent and child to intervene and monitors bed-wetting as the program proceeds. Parents and child should be told that this treatment requires a long-term commitment and may take several months to achieve a cure. The device can be discontinued when the child has had three consecutive weeks of dry nights. The cure rate may be as high as 70% long-term. Among the 10% to 15% of children who relapse,most can be treated successfully with a repeat of the original alarm program.Methods to reduce alarm failure include pretesting the child for his or her ability to awaken to the alarm and encouraging parents and child to continue using the alarm. Failure also can be reduced by enabling the child who is afraid of the dark to walk to the toilet using a flashlight or night light in the room or by offering other options to the child who is reluctant to try an enuresis alarm. If a child does not awaken to the alarm during pretesting, dry-bed training or parent awakening should precede the use of the alarm. One study showed that an ordinary alarm clock used with dry-bed training was as effective as an enuresis alarm. This may be an attractive alternative to families who cannot afford an alarm or whose insurance will not cover it.(See the 1997 Pediatrics in Review article by Schmitt for practical tips on successful use of the enuresis alarm.)Medication is an attractive treatment modality for parents who hope for relatively effortless success. However, medication alone for initial treatment of nocturnal enuresis is never preferred and seldom should be considered before 8 years of age, even in combination therapy. Three drugs are used most commonly for the treatment of enuresis: imipramine, desmopressin(DDAVP), and oxybutynin. Imipramine and DDAVP have been evaluated in the treatment of MNE; oxybutynin is used primarily in polysymptomatic enuresis.Imipramine is a tricyclic antidepressant that has been used for more than 3 decades to treat nocturnal enuresis. It appears to increase bladder capacity through a weak anticholinergic effect and also may decrease detrusor muscle contractions via noradrenergic effects. The starting dose is 25 mg taken 1 hour before bedtime for children ages 6 to 8 years and 50 to 75 mg for older children and adolescents. The duration of action is 8 to 12 hours. The dose may be increased in 25-mg increments weekly up to 75 mg. Therapy may continue from 3 to 9 months, with a slow tapering of medication recommended over 3 to 4 weeks in 25-mg decrements. Imipramine is relatively inexpensive,and the clinical response is usually apparent during the first week of treatment. The initial success rate(dry at 6 months posttreatment) is reported to be 15% to 50%, but the relapse rate is high following drug discontinuation.When used at the recommended dosage, mild side effects include irritability, dry mouth, decreased appetite, headaches, and sleep disturbances. An accidental or intentional overdose, however, can have serious and potentially lethal effects, including ventricular dysrhythmias, seizures, and coma. Because of its narrow toxic/therapeutic ratio, some clinicians are understandably reluctant to use imipramine to treat a relatively benign, self-limiting condition such as nocturnal enuresis. If imipramine therapy is selected,the physician must counsel the family carefully about the dangerous potential of its accidental ingestion,safe storage of the drug, and supervision of the child taking the medication.DDAVP is a synthetic analog of arginine vasopressin (ADH). Acting on the distal tubules of the kidney, it increases water reabsorption in the collecting ducts, producing a more concentrated, lower volume of urine. The use of DDAVP to treat nocturnal enuresis is based on the observation that some children who have enuresis do not have the normal nocturnal rise in ADH production, potentially leading to polyuria. DDAVP theoretically reduces urine volume at night in such children, who thereby can avoid a full bladder at night.DDAVP is available in an oral form and a nasal spray. The bioavailability is only 1% for the tablet and 10% for the nasal spray. Its duration of action is extended (approximately 10 to 12 h), and it is rapidly absorbed from the nasal mucosa. The initial dose of DDAVP is 20 mcg or one 10-mcg puff in each nostril within 2 hours of bedtime, regardless of the patient's age. The dose may be increased in increments of 10 mcg every 1 or 2 weeks up to a maximum dose of 40 mcg. The response to DDAVP usually can be evaluated within a few days of starting therapy. Patients may remain on medication for 3 to 6 months,then should begin a slow decrease of the dose by 10 mcg/mo. If a child remains enuretic after 6 months of therapy, combination therapy may be considered. If oral medication is preferred, the starting dose is 0.2 mg(one tablet) administered 1 hour before bedtime. If there is no response within 1 week, the dose can be titrated by 0.2 mg up to a maximum of 0.6 mg nightly.Side effects of DDAVP are rare and include abdominal discomfort, nausea, headache, and epistaxis. Symptomatic hyponatremia with seizures has been reported very rarely, usually in the context of exceeding the recommended dosage. Nonetheless,nighttime fluid restriction is a reasonable recommendation for those receiving DDAVP. Contraindications include habit polydipsia,hypertension, and heart disease. There are few data on long-term use of DDAVP. In a Swedish study that monitored children who had MNE, 22% became dry with DDAVP, a response not significantly different from the spontaneous cure rate of 15% per year. All patients, however, had a marked reduction in the number of enuretic events per month. More patients remained dry after slow tapering of the DDAVP dose than following abrupt discontinuation of the medicine. Various studies show immediate response rates as high as 70% and relapse rates as high as 95%. Moffat et al reviewed 18 controlled studies of DDAVP and found overall that only 25% of children were completely dry on the medicine, with a relapse rate similar to that noted previously.DDAVP's high initial response rate is attractive for episodic use to treat enuresis, alone or in combination with other treatments. It can be very useful for summer camp and sleepovers to prevent enuresis. DDAVP also may be useful to bridge the gap between enuresis and dryness during other treatments. Using DDAVP episodically also reduces its rather significant cost, which may be $150 to$250 for 1 month of nightly use.Oxybutynin chloride is an anticholinergic and antispasmodic drug that has a role in reducing uninhibited bladder contractions. It is used primarily to treat children who have symptoms of daytime urgency or frequency in addition to nighttime enuresis. It appears to be no better than placebo in treating children who have MNE. Side effects are related to the anticholinergic action of the drug and include flushing, blurred vision, constipation, tremor, and decreased ability to sweat. The recommended starting dose is 5 to 10 mg/d (or 0.1 mg/kg) for most children. This drug is not approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration to treat enuresis in children younger than 5 years of age. Hyoscyamine is another anticholinergic agent used to treat bladder instability that recently has received attention in clinical studies on enuresis. These medications may play a role in the treatment of PNE.As a condition that has no single etiology and various causal factors in any one patient, it is not surprising that a single method of treating nocturnal enuresis is often of limited success. Age-related strategies that combine more than one treatment may improve response rates.For young children and their parents, reassurance and education about enuresis are of utmost importance. They must understand that nocturnal wetting is not the child's fault. There is no place for ridicule or a punitive approach to the problem by parents, siblings,or peers. Previously described motivational and behavioral methods that assist the child in waking to void and that praise successful dryness suit this age group best.For children who still have nocturnal enuresis at this age and for whom the child and family request an intervention, the enuresis alarm gives the best results in terms of response rate and low relapse rate. This also is the age at which intermittent use of medication such as DDAVP can be useful for special events such as an overnight at a friend's home or a camping trip.Because of the emotional impact of persistent bed-wetting in adolescence, aggressive intervention is indicated. If use of an enuresis alarm does not stop or greatly reduce the wetting episodes, continuous use of medication is justified as additional treatment. When 2 months of dryness using the combination of alarm and medication are achieved, the medication should be tapered gradually while continuing to use the enuresis alarm.Assessments of treatment results of enuresis must consider the rate of initial response, the duration of response, and the relapse rate. In general, studies comparing an alarm system with placebo or drug therapy show the alarm system to have the most favorable combination of initial response rate (60% to 70%) and relapse rate (10% to 30%), especially when dryness is assessed at 12 months after initiating treatment. The success rate with alarms, of course, depends on continued use of the alarm. A significant number of families (30% to 50%) discontinue use of the alarm within only 2 to 3 weeks. Studies evaluating medication alone compared with placebo show favorable initial response(10% to 60%), but a significant relapse rate (80% to 90%) when the child is off medication. Two studies documented identical rates of 56% of children maintaining dryness after 12 months' use of an alarm system. In both studies,the rate of dryness after 12 months when using medication alone, either imipramine or DDAVP, was no better than the expected improvement rate of about 15% with no treatment.Nocturnal enuresis is a common problem seen by the primary care physician. It remains a source of considerable anxiety for the child, parents, and sometimes the pediatrician. In spite of several decades of research, no single explanation or classification of enuresis is sufficient. The nocturnal wetting episode occurs when the child does not awaken during sleep at a time when urine volume exceeds functional bladder capacity, due either to excess urine production, small bladder capacity, or both. This perspective requires the practitioner to take a careful history for polyuria, sleep dysfunction, and daytime bladder symptoms to devise the best treatment for each child. Once organic causes are ruled out by careful history and physical examination, no laboratory or radiographic evaluation is necessary beyond a simple urinalysis. Although a spontaneous cure rate of 15% per year can be expected, intervention may benefit some children through earlier attained dryness and improved self-esteem. Behavior therapies, including alarm systems, have the best long-term results, but they require strong family commitment and do not offer immediate results. Medication has a better short-term cure rate than motivational/behavioral therapy, but relapse rates are high when drugs are discontinued. A combination of behavioral therapy and pharmacotherapy is reasonable if monotherapy fails. The ultimate goal is for the child to maintain nighttime dryness or to self-awaken to void at night.",

This may be indistinguishable clinically from mechanical or organic obstruction due to inflammation or neoplasia. As in the small intestine, this group of disorders may be neuropathic or myopathic in origin. The most prevalent mechanical disorder of the large intestine is diverticular disease, although irritable bowel syndrome is the most common so-called 'functional' disorder. In this chapter, the pathology of these diseases is described in detail, along with an up-to-date classification and recent advances in our understanding of their pathogenesis.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN) are disorders characterized by aberrant patterns of feeding behavior and weight regulation, and disturbances in attitudes and perceptions toward body weight and shape. In AN, there is an inexplicable fear of weight gain and unrelenting obsession with fatness even in the face of increasing cachexia. Bulimia nervosa usually emerges after a period of dieting, which may or may not have been associated with weight loss. Binge eating is followed by either self-induced vomiting or some other means of compensation for the excess of food ingested. Most people with BN have irregular feeding patterns and satiety may be impaired. Although abnormally low body weight is an exclusion for the diagnosis of BN, some 25% to 30% of bulimics presenting to treatment centers have a prior history of AN; however, all bulimics have pathological concern with weight and shape. Common to individuals with AN or BN are low selfesteem, depression, and anxiety.",

Prolonged delirium can also affect patients with multiple predisposing and/or precipitating factors. In clinical practice, prolonged delirium is often unrecognized, and can be misdiagnosed as other psychiatric disorders. We describe a case of a 59-year-old male presenting with behavioral and cognitive symptoms that was first misdiagnosed as a mood disorder in a general hospital setting. After prolonged delirium due to multiple factors was confirmed, the patient was treated accordingly with symptomatic management. He evolved with progressive improvement of his clinical status. Early diagnosis and management of prolonged delirium are important to improve patient prognosis and avoid iatrogenic measures.Delirium pode ser conceituado como o declínio agudo na função cognitiva que geralmente dura de horas a dias. O delírio prolongado também pode afetar pacientes com múltiplos fatores predisponentes e/ou precipitantes.

Aqui, descrevemos o caso de um homem de 59 anos apresentando sintomas comportamentais e cognitivos que foi diagnosticado inicialmente com transtorno de humor em um hospital geral. Após ser diagnosticado delirium prolongado devido a múltiplos fatores, o paciente foi tratado de acordo, evoluindo com melhora progressiva do seu estado clínico. O diagnóstico e o manejo precoces do delirium prolongado são importantes para melhorar o prognóstico do paciente e evitar medidas iatrogênicas.",

Different pathophysiological mechanisms lead to constipation. Its assessment and diagnosis should refer to the Rome-III criteria, taking into account a stool free interval of more than 72 hours, the assessment of the subjective „feeling of being constipated”, and the consistence of the stool. The use of laxatives should adapt to these pathophysiological causes according to a step scheme, both for prophylaxis and therapy. The combinational use of osmotic and stimulant laxatives is most effective. Recent approaches include opioid antagonists for the management of an opioid-induced constipation.",

Esta entidad esta asociada a coomorbilidad psiquiatrica, por lo que las caracteristicas clinicas se hacen mas complejas con el paso del tiempo. El manejo fundamental se basa en la suspension del medicamento sobre el que se centra el abuso (analgesicos, ergotamina, triptanes y opioides). Sin embargo, es necesario tomar en consideracion que la suspension de estos medicamentos puede asociarse a otros problemas como “cefalea de rebote”, sindrome de abstinencia o convulsiones epilepticas; incrementando las tasas de recaida en estos pacientes.

SUMMARY The medication overuse headache (MOH) is define as daily or almost daily headache (15 days or more) in patients with history of primary headache who takes excessive medications. This pathology is associated with psychiatric conditions, reason why with the time the clinical characteristics become more complex. The basic treatment is stopping the medication (analgesic, ergotamine, triptans or opioids), but this could bring us another problem called “rebound headache”, withdrawal sindrome or epileptic convulsions. These symptoms could increase the relapsing rate on this patients.",

The disease is characterized by discrete periods of binge eating during which, large amounts of food are consumed and a sense of control over eating is absent, followed by differing types of purging behaviour to prevent weight gain. Since the first descriptions of the diagnosis, little is known about the aetiological background of the disease. BN is accompanied by, or due to, alterations of serotonin and/or norepinephrine activity.

Nausea is the unpleasant feeling of needing to vomit, and may be accompanied by symptoms such as feeling sweaty and clammy, and the patient may have no desire to do anything except lie quiet and still. Vomiting is the forceful expulsion of the gastric contents through the mouth. Nausea is under the physiological control of the vomiting centre in the medulla. Oral medication may be adequate to control nausea, but the rectal or subcutaneous route may be better for persistent nausea. The patient's nausea may be caused by more than one stimulus activating more than one site in the brain. Corticosteroids are not anti-emetics as such, but sometimes have a non-specific action in reducing nausea and vomiting and, of course, have a role in reducing raised intracranial pressure or reducing the size of an enlarging liver pressing on the stomach.",

The effects of Bulimia Nervosa (BN) and Binge eating disorder on immunity are less well studied. Patients with BN do not become as emaciated as patients with AN, but their weight often fluctuates >5 kg, due to the alternating binge eating and fasting or purging behaviour. Functional gastrointestinal disorders are common in eating disorder patients, and in the majority of patients these persist even after the recovery from eating disorders, particularly in psychologically distressed patients. Neuropeptides may well have a significant part to play in the pathogenesis of eating disorders.",

      "title": "Electrogastrography for Evaluating Neurologically Impaired Children with Recurrent Vomiting",
      "abstract": "Author's Reply To the Editor: We very much appreciate Dr. Bustorff-Silva's observations. As Dr. Bustorff-Silva implies, the major issue regarding vomiting in neurologically impaired children is the pathogenesis of vomiting itself. It is clear that primary gastroesophageal reflux can be particularly severe in these children because of several concurrent and aggravating factors (e.g., scoliosis, prolonged supine positioning, poor swallowing) that have been recalled in our report. It also seems clear that a central nervous system disorder involving the brainstem nuclei of cranial nerves or areas next to the area postrema and the \"vomiting centers\" may result in a severe and widespread disturbance of gastrointestinal motility or a persistent activation of the emetic reflex, thereby causing what should more appropriately be defined as \"secondary\" gastroesophageal reflux. Because disturbances of gastric motility, such as gastric dysrhythmia and delayed gastric emptying may occur in both cases (i.e., widespread motility disorder and activation of the emetic reflex), a distinction between the two mechanisms is not easy to draw. The simple clinical observation may provide some clues-for instance, the presence of retching and other autonomic manifestations, such as sweating, pallor, and tachycardia, would support the\"reflex\" rather than the \"reflux\" mechanism (1). Whether we are facing a motility disorder involving the gastrointestinal tract well beyond the lower esophageal sphincter or a persistent activation of the emetic reflex (or both), it seems clear that the Nissen fundoplication may not solve the problem, and in fact it may even make it worse. Dr. Bustorff-Silva rightly suggests that preoperative and postoperative electrogastrography should help clarify the issue of which patients would benefit from fundoplication. Indeed, we recently showed some preliminary evidence that patients in whom gastric electrical activity is normal before fundoplication tend to do well, whereas those who have gastric dysrhythmias beforehand tend to experience retching and severe postprandial discomfort after the fundoplication (2). Electrogastrography may thus contribute to the clinical and pathophysiological information that should be gathered and carefully evaluated in neurologically impaired children with \"refractory\" gastroesophageal reflux, so that the pharmacologic, nutritional, or surgical therapeutic interventions can be more successfully tailored to the individual patient.

      "abstract": "Сочетание дисфагии с нарушениями речи и других высших психических функций у лиц с последствиями инсульта делает их зависимыми от окружающих. Обезвоживание и недоедание достаточно распространены у этой категории пациентов, что требует применения методик модификация диеты. Данная категория больных находится в группе риска летального исхода вследствие развития аспирационной пневмонии, обусловленной дисфагией, а невозможность или недостатки общения не позволяют им сообщить о потребностях в питье и еде, что приводит к снижению потребления пищи, активизации катаболических процессов, обезвоживанию, появлению постинсультной усталости, депрессии и снижению качества жизни. Сочетание дисфагии и афазии у пациентов в постинсультном периоде является осложняющим фактором реабилитации функции глотания из-за нарушения речи. Без специальных логопедических занятий восстановление нарушенных речевых функций, как и глотания, затруднено или невозможно. Пациентам с дисфагией и афазией с целью стимулирования понимания речи в процессе выполнения ими инструкций по преодолению дисфагии, с одной стороны, и восстановления речи – с другой, необходим персонифицированный подход к подбору коммуникативных моделей. Соблюдение рекомендаций логопеда по восстановлению речевых функций пациента с использованием методик нутритивной поддержки (загустителей пищи и продуктов специализированного питания) позволяет минимизировать осложнения дисфагии, уменьшить выраженность речевых нарушений и повысить реабилитационный потенциал больных. В статье описан опыт применения персонифицированных коммуникативных моделей у 128 пациентов с постинсультной афазией и дисфагией. Учет структуры и выраженности речевого дефекта, правильная организация ухода за пациентами и использование коммуникативных моделей во время кормления позволили перевести больных на пероральное питание. Таким образом, использование персонифицированных видов коммуникативных моделей для пациентов с сочетанием афазии и дисфагии позволяет уменьшить или полностью нивелировать нарушения глотания, значительно улучшить состояние речи, сократить сроки реабилитации и повысить качество жизни больных. The combination of dysphagia with speech disorders and other higher mental functions in people with the consequences of a stroke makes them dependent on others. Dehydration and malnutrition are quite common in this category of patients, which requires the use of diet modification techniques. This category of patients are at risk of death due to the development of aspiration pneumonia caused by dysphagia, and the impossibility or lack of communication does not allow them to report their needs for drinking and eating, which leads to a decrease in food intake, activation of catabolic processes, dehydration, and the appearance of «post-stroke fatigue», depression and a decrease in the quality of life. The combination of dysphagia and aphasia in patients in the post-stroke period is a complicating factor in the rehabilitation of swallowing function due to the presence of speech impairment. Without special speech therapy classes, the restoration of impaired speech functions, as well as swallowing, is difficult or impossible. For patients with dysphagia and aphasia, in order to stimulate speech understanding in the process of fulfilling instructions for overcoming dysphagia, on the one hand, and restoring speech, on the other hand, a personalized approach to the selection of communication models is needed. Compliance with the recommendations of a speech therapist can minimize the complications of dysphagia, reduce the severity of speech disorders. The use of thickeners and specialized food products when feeding patients can minimize the complications of dysphagia and increase the rehabilitation potential of patients. The article describes the experience of using personalized communication models for 128 patients with post-stroke aphasia and dysphagia. Taking into account the structure and severity of the speech defect, the correct organization of patient care and the use of communication models during feeding made it possible to transfer patients to oral nutrition. Thus, the use of personalized types of communication models for patients with a combination of aphasia and dysphagia can reduce or completely eliminate swallowing disorders, significantly improve the state of speech, shorten the rehabilitation period and improve the quality of life of patients.",

      "title": "Case Report: Mental Confusion, Diplopia, and Inability to Stand in an 82‐Year‐Old‐Man",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: Wernicke's encephalopathy (WE) is a neurological disease caused by a deficiency of thiamine. Alcoholics account for most of the cases, but patients with malnutrition due to hyperemesis, vomiting, starvation, renal dialysis, parenteral nutrition, and cancer are also at risk; in this group of patients WE is often underrecognized.1, 2 In a recent retrospective study based on autopsy, alcoholism was present only in 50% of cases, and nonalcoholic subjects had a clinical history of malnutrition, gastroplasty, and neoplasia.3 The characteristic clinical triad is that of ophthalmoplegia, ataxia, and global confusion, and the diagnosis is based on anamnesis, clinical examination, laboratory tests (dosage of pyruvate and transketolase), and on neuroimaging.4 WE is usually associated with other manifestations of nutritional disease, such as polyneuropathy, or with manifestations related to the coexistence of cardiovascular (wet) beriberi, such as tachycardia, postural hypotension, and edema of the legs. Rarely do amblyopia or spinal spastic ataxia occur. WE is a medical emergency, and mortality in the acute phase is about 17%. Response to treatment with thiamine is dramatic, but a syndrome characterized by gaps in memory, confabulation, and disordered temporal sequencing is frequently persistent (e.g., Korsakoff's psychosis). An 82-year-old man was referred to us because of mental confusion, diplopia, and his inability to stand for 2 days. The patient's medical history included ankylopoietic spondylosis treated with sulfasalazine, hypertension, and some recent transient ischemic attacks. The patient was not an alcoholic and during the prior week had suffered from hyperemesis and vomiting. The clinical examination showed inability to stand, convergent strabismus due to deficit of the sixth left cranial nerve, horizontal nystagmus on lateral gaze, ataxia, absence of patellar reflexes, edema of the legs, tachycardia, and hypotension (85/60 mmHg). The blood gas analysis showed lactic acidosis.5 Suspecting an acute stroke of the brainstem,6 a cerebral computed tomography (showing vascular encephalopathy and periventricular rarefaction of the white matter) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were performed. This latter examination showed lesions of the mamillary bodies, the periaqueductal thalamic regions, and the cerebellar vermis, indicative of WE. An electromyography showed the presence of polyneuropathy. On this basis, a thiamine dose of 100 mg was administrated intramuscularly, with dramatic improvement; vigilance normalized, strabismus and diplopia recovered, and arterial pressure and heart rate normalized. During the following days, there was continuous improvement in clinical conditions, even though the patient remained mildly confused and confabulating. The ataxia disappeared, but inability to stand and walk still persisted. The MRI scan showed a reduction in the number and extension of the lesions of the brainstem.7 The patient began physical therapy with poor results; he was alert but could not stand without help and walk, probably because of the associated irreversible polyneuropathy. In conclusion, WE should always be suspected in the elderly with malnutrition, disorders of ocular motility, and alteration of consciousness, even without a clinical history of alcoholism. The coexistence of cardiovascular symptoms or signs of lactic acidosis may be of help in the diagnosis of the disease. Administration of thiamine dramatically improves the clinical condition,8 confirming the diagnostic hypothesis. Thus it should be of utmost importance, in cases of patients with inexplicable stupor or coma, to immediately start treatment with thiamine, while waiting for the results of laboratory tests and neuroimaging.",

For several reasons, renal transplantation is not\r\nA easily available option. Patient may not be able to procure a stuitable\r\nKidney, age and other medical conditions may debar the patient from\r\nThat treatment option leaving him with the only option of regular\r\nDialysis.\r\nDialysis as a procedure, either hemodialysis or peritoneal\r\nDialysis or other ambulatory dialysis methods involves several physical\r\nAs well as psychological trauma that will lead to various psychiatric\r\nIllness which in turn imapairs the quality of life of these patients. The\r\nPatient will have to tolerate the loss of independence, dependence on\r\nThe dialysis machines, rigorous drug regimens involving drugs like\r\nMultiviatamins, phosphate binders, calcium supplements, iorn\r\nSupplements, errthropoietin injections…etc, and not to forget the\r\nFinancial burden.

The “X” factor in most of these situations has been\r\nIdentified as psychological impairments.

Old\r\nAge, pain, comorbid medical or surgical conditions, financial stresses,\r\nPoor social support, have been identified as few important factors that\r\nPredispose the patients to depression and other other psychological\r\nImpairments.

      "abstract": "A common neurological condition known as epilepsy is characterized by recurrent bouts of uncontrollable body movements that affect only a portion of the body (partial) or the full body (generalized), occasionally accompanied by loss of consciousness and control over bowel or bladder function. Uncontrolled seizures are linked to medical and psychological illness, dependent behavior, a low quality of life, and a higher risk of untimely death. Epilepsy affects people of all ages, ethnicities, sexes, levels of education, socioeconomic status, and social classes worldwide. The prodrome phase is a pre-epileptic feeling or experience that might start hours, days, or even weeks in advance of the actual seizure. The most prevalent prodromal phase symptoms include difficulties maintaining focus, tension, exhaustion, sleep disruptions, behavioral changes (differently smelling, tasting, having ringing in the ears, feeling queasy, etc.), restlessness, and others. The ictal phase defined as spans the interval between the start of a seizure and its conclusion. The phrase \"interictal\" refers to a phase that occurs between seizures or headaches. \"Postictal\" refers to the period following a seizure. The duration of postictalphase varies from minutes to hours depending on the type of seizure, the frequency and intensity of seizures, and the length of the seizure.",

      "abstract": "Unsettled behaviour in the first few months of life is a common clinical problem, with the associated risks of postnatal depression, premature cessation of breastfeeding, long-term psychological disturbance, and child abuse. Parents of new babies complain of difficulty accessing appropriate care and receiving conflicting advice. Although organic disturbance is implicated in only 5% of cases, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease, food allergies and lactose intolerance are often mistakenly diagnosed in unsettled babies. There is no evidence that acid-suppressive medications help in treating unsettled behaviour and, until the hypothesis that proton-pump inhibitors may predispose to food allergies has been properly investigated, treatment with acid-suppressive medications should be avoided in this population. Although unsettled behaviour in infants is commonly a transient neurodevelopmental phenomenon that peaks at 6 weeks of age, failure to diagnose other correctable problems, including breastfeeding difficulty and cows milk allergy, risks entrenching anxiety and disrupted mother–infant interactions in the long term. In the current climate of health system reform, the design and evaluation of an integrated, evidence-based, multidisciplinary primary care approach to management of unsettled babies and their mothers is a priority.",

Its more significant characteristic is its invariable association with other serious illnesses. In more than half of the cases it is seen in chronic alcoholic patients or in chronic illnesses accompanied by malnutrition or hydroelectrolytic disturbances. It is not related to sex or the age group. The most frequent cause is the treatment of hyponatremia, when there is a too rapid increase of the sodium levels. The basic lesion is the destruction of the myelin sheaths, with relatively unharmed axon; and it affects part or the whole base of the protuberance in a symmetrical form (pontine demyelination). The patients suffering from this illness usually present subacute progressive tetraparesis accompanied by pseudobulbar paralysis with dysarthria and the impossibility of protruding the tongue, together with partial or total paralysis of the ocular horizontal movements. Some patients present mutism and a state of paralysis with preservation of understanding and the sensory ways (pseudocoma or locked-in syndrome). The diagnosis of certainty of this entity is anatomopathologic. Nevertheless, the capacity of the computerized axial tomography (CAT), and especially that of the nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), to visualize the pontine lesions have largely increased the frequency of the pre-mortem diagnosis. There is not a specific treatment for this illness. It should be prevented avoiding the sharp changes in plasma sodium level in patients with hyponatremia.

      "abstract": "La restriction alimentaire chronique correspond a un des troubles du comportement alimentaire observe en particulier dans l’anorexie mentale (AN) de type restrictif, pathologie qui touche essentiellement les adolescentes et les jeunes femmes. En plus de ce comportement restrictif, une activite physique importante est observee chez un grand nombre de patientes (40 a 80% des cas). Cette maladie se traduit par de nombreuses alterations physiologiques comme des perturbations neuroendocrines, metaboliques, osseuses (osteopenie, osteoporose) et ce quelle que soit la cause psychiatrique qui a conduit au developpement de ce comportement. De plus, de nombreux arguments suggerent que l’AN pourrait etre consideree comme un trouble « addictif » qui se manifesterait par une addiction a la perte de poids et/ou a la restriction alimentaire ou encore a l’activite physique suggerant une alteration du systeme dopaminergique de recompense. Ainsi, quelles que soient les origines de la maladie, l’AN entraine des perturbations peripheriques et centrales susceptibles d’etre impliquees dans une premiere phase dite « d’adaptation » permettant aux malades de survivre a ces conditions drastiques. Les patients peuvent par la suite tomber dans une seconde phase de « chronicisation » dans laquelle ces memes facteurs pourraient etre responsables de la degradation de l’etat des malades et conduire, dans les cas les plus graves d’epuisement, a la mort.Notre etude a comme pivot la ghreline, hormone orexigene, dont les concentrations plasmatiques sont augmentees significativement chez les patients anorexiques. Secretee principalement en peripherie par les cellules de l’estomac, elle va cibler plusieurs organes aussi bien peripheriques que centraux. En particulier, au niveau peripherique, cette hormone agit au niveau du foie dont la principale fonction connue est le maintien de l’homeostasie glucidique. Elle agit egalement au niveau du tissu adipeux qui est alors stimule, favorisant ainsi sa croissance avec un stockage des reserves et au niveau musculaire en entrainant entre autre une diminution des reserves de triglycerides. Au niveau du systeme nerveux central, parmi les sites d’action de la ghreline, on trouve les structures impliquees aussi bien dans le controle, qualifie d’homeostatique, de la prise alimentaire represente par l’hypothalamus, que dans le controle, dit hedonique (motivation/recompense), de ce meme comportement correspondant au circuit meso-limbique. Pour etudier son implication dans les mecanismes adaptatifs, et eventuellement, dans l’aggravation de la maladie, nous avons mis au point un modele animal de restriction alimentaire chronique mimant les symptomes physiologiques de l’AN. Notre premier objectif a ete de caracteriser (« phenotypage ») ce modele sur le plan physiologique (metabolique, endocrinien) afin de l’utiliser pour notre deuxieme objectif : evaluation du role de la ghreline comme potentiel facteur predictif de l’evolution de la maladie.Les donnees obtenues valident notre modele comme un modele pertinent pour etudier sur le long terme les alterations physiologiques et centrales decrites dans l’AN de type restrictif. Nous montrons que l’exercice physique modere associe a la restriction alimentaire a des effets stabilisateurs sur de nombreux parametres metaboliques limitant ainsi un epuisement premature des ressources energetiques. En ce qui concerne la ghreline, les concentrations plasmatiques elevees observees dans notre modele pourraient contribuer egalement a une regulation adaptative du metabolisme energetique.",

The first type is characterized by superficial mucous disorders with constant or increased secretory function and motility of the stomach. It has relapsing course with moderate decrease of patient's life quality. The abdominal pains and dyspepsia are observed only at periods of exacerbation. Anxiety-phobic and anxiety-depressive tendencies prevail in the mental status. The attitude to illness differs mainly by emotional-willed disorders. Insomnia is manifested by a slight delay in awakening. Focal atrophic gastritis with moderate decrease in secretory and motor functions of the stomach is typical for the second type. It develops as relapsing or monotonous suffering with insignificant decrease in patient's life quality. The pains and dyspepsia in residual state persist after exacerbation reduction. The changes in the mental status are rare. The patient's attitude to the illness is basically adequate. Slight disturbances of falling asleep prevail among sleep disorders. Diffuse atrophic gastritis with secretory failure reaching the degree of an achlorhydria and hypokinesis of stomach are observed in the third type. The course of the disease is basically monotonous with pronounced decrease in patient's life quality, with the obstinate abdominal pains and dyspepsia irrespective of the exacerbation phases of chronic gastritis. A combination of asthenic and neurotic complaints and combined sleep disorders are typical. Emotional disorders with disharmonization of personality accompanied by signs of their social and mental disadaptation are observed in the patient's mental status.",

      "abstract": "A colonic pseudo-obstruction is a disorder that causes abdominal distension and abdominal pain similar to a mechanical obstruction, but there are no structural lesions that can obstruct the gastrointestinal tract. This condition can be acute or chronic. An acute colonic pseudo-obstruction, also called Ogilvie's syndrome, is believed to be a condition induced by other causes that are different from a chronic colonic pseudo-obstruction. The pathogenesis involves abnormalities in the autonomic nervous system induced by systemic diseases or medications, and it often improves when the primary causes are treated. On the other hand, a chronic colonic pseudo-obstruction can occur repeatedly without a particular cause. The authors encountered neuroleptic malignant syndrome that caused acute colonic pseudo-obstruction. This paper reports a case with a review of the relevant literature. This is the first case reported in Korea. This case shows that physicians should consider neuroleptic malignant syndrome as a cause of an acute colonic pseudo-obstruction.",

      "abstract": "Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is defined as a condition which develops when the reflux of gastric contents causes troublesome symptoms, impairs quality of life, or leads to mucosal damage or complications. There are two main phenotypic presentations of GERD, the erosive (ERD) and non-erosive reflux disease (NERD), with the latter one representing up to 70% of GERD spectrum. Moreover, patients with GERD can be clinically subdivided into two distinct syndromes: patients with esophageal and extraesophageal symptoms. The diagnosis of NERD should be supported by the evidence that symptoms are due to reflux episodes on the basis of an excess of acid into the esophagus or a positive correlation between symptoms and acid and/or weakly acidic reflux episodes as evidenced by 24-hour impedance-pH monitoring. Patients with normal esophageal acid exposure and no correlation between heartburn and any kind of chemical reflux are considered affected by functional heartburn and do not pertain to the realm of NERD. They do not usually respond to PPI therapy as further empirical criterion and are included in the large group of functional digestive disorders with the expression of altered generation or perception of symptoms at the esophageal level and can often overlap with functional dyspepsia and irritable bowel syndrome.",

Sometimes it does present with typical symptoms like bloating, flatulence and altered bowel habits. At times there is mental illness like severe depression that comes in the way which is real challenge for the physicians to treat as mere reassurance doesn’t suffice. The longer the history of symptoms, more complicated it gets. There are multiple obstacles before making in rows in treatment.2 The most frustrating point is when the patient fails to show any improvement after months of treatment. They have symptoms in relapsing and remitting manner. Post infectious IBS is more agonizing as the patient need antibiotics in an era of increasing resistance .3Failure of one antibiotic to resolve symptoms leads to usage of multiple ones at the same time .The cramping abdominal pain and the sleepless nights leading to daytime fatigue do have an enormous and disastrous impact on the activities of daily living. After the decades of research, optimization of treatment for irritable bowel syndrome is still a daunting task even for experienced gastroenterologists.4 The emergence of alarm symptoms like bleeding per rectum,uninetentional weight loss and feeling of abdominal mass in individuals who have altered bowel for years do ring the bell for physicians to act vigilantly who were otherwise complacent. 4They were relying on traditional treatment regimens like giving laxatives,anti spasmodic and medications for depression. Some of them do consider expeditious referral to psychiatrist without getting to the bottom of the situation.

Metabolic seizures can be caused by various amino acids metabolic disorders, disorders of energy metabolism, cofactor-related metabolic diseases, purine and pyrimidine metabolic diseases, congenital disorders of glycosylation, and lysosomal and peroxisomal disorders. Diagnosing metabolic seizures without delay is essential because the immediate initiation of appropriate therapy for many metabolic diseases can prevent or minimize complications.",

      "title": "The Depressed Patient",
      "abstract": "DEPRESSION IS A PHENOMENON that most of us experience to a greater or lesser degree at some time in our lives. It is a psychophysiological state, manifested psychologically by feelings of sadness, worthlessness, hopelessness, of emptiness. There is a lack of interest in the events of the outside world. Activities that are usually enjoyed become flat, dull, meaningless. Physically, there is a slowing down of bodily functions. The respiratory rate is slow. The gastrointestinal slowdown results in retarded emptying of the stomach and intestines, leading to a loss of appetite, a feeling of fullness in the stomach, burping, and constipation. Muscle tension decreases, leading to drooping facies, the slumped posture, the slow, dragging gait. Eyeballs tend to be sunken and the eyes lacking in luster. Sleep disturbance is common. There may be difficulty in going to sleep, in staying asleep, or, on the other hand, there may be an increased desire for sleep. Along with a lessened interest in external events, there is a loss of interest in grooming and personal hygiene. The same dark, dull clothes may be worn day after day. These manifestations seem to reflect the depressed person's general lack of selfesteem and self-confidence, and his lack of belief that life can be worth living. The cognitive functions are slowed down. Questions are answered hesitantly, often after a pause. Conversation is seldom initiated and often confined to monosyllables and to reminiscing about past events, frequently of an unhappy nature. Cryng is frequent. Thinking requires conscious effort. Concentration is difficult. The attention span is short for topics unrelated to the feelings of the depression. The depressed person's attitude toward life itself varies from a feeling that this world is unfit to live in to a belief that one is not fit to live and that the world would be a better place if one were not in it, that is, if one were dead. The former set of attitudes is frequently an unspoken plea for succor and support. The latter, which usually occurs only in pathological states of deep depression, indicates a suicidal danger. The old adage that one who talks of suicide will not kill himself is unfounded. Anyone who talks of suicide should be regarded with concern and the matter investigated by someone skilled in dealing with psychiatric illness. Nursing care must be provided to protect the person against his self-destructive tendencies and to reduce the environmental hazards, although this latter is difficult in ordinary life situations. Constant supportive nursing care is probably more fruitful and much more comforting to the person involved. Mrs. Neylan (Brandon General Hospital School of Nursing, Manitoba, Canada; B.N., McGill University) is senior lecturer at the University of British Columbia School of Nursing in Vancouver, B.C., Canada.",

The authors submit two case-histories of middle aged women (30 and 37 years old) without disturbances of the day-time eating behaviour, without obvious psychopathology where the symptomatology of NES developed slowly from the age of 14 and 25 years resp. Both patients ate at night small amounts of easily consumed foods which they went to fetch in the kitchen as often as five times per night. Their behaviour was calm and aimed. Usually they did not remember the nocturnal eating. Polysomnographic examination in both patients revealed poor sleep with frequent changes of the sleep stages, with frequent awakenings, in both patients incl. even awakening from deep NREM sleep.

      "abstract": "Recent advances in the investigation of brain-gut interaction in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) were reviewed. Brain is suggested to play an important role in the pathophysiology of IBS on the basis of the following evidence. (1) Stress often induces major symptoms of IBS patients (Drossman et al., 1982), simultaneously with colonic hypermotility (Fukudo et al., 1987) or dysmotility of the small intestine (Kumar et al., 1985). (2) IBS patients rarely express symptoms or small intestinal dysmotility during sleep (Kellow et al., 1990). (3) IBS patients complain of more pain with balloon distension of the colon or rectum than normal controls; visceral perception is enhanced in IBS (Whitehead et al., 1990). (4) IBS patients often show psychoneurotic symptoms and extra-colonic somatic symptoms (Young et al., 1976). (5) There are some animal (Williams et al, 1987) or human (Dinan et al, 1990) experiments which indicate the possible involvement of brain peptide or brain monoamine in IBS. (6) Dysrhythmia or increased beta power in electroencephalogram is observed more often in IBS patients than in the normal controls (Fukudo et al, 1991) in addition to abnormal REM sleep in IBS patients (Kumar et al., 1992). These observations support our hypothesis that not only the gut but also the brain show dysfunction and exaggerated responsivity to the stimuli in IBS. Further research on brain-gut interaction in IBS is warranted.",

One month old infants are normally awake during one-third of the nocturnal sleeping time. Gradually, sleep moves into night and wakefulness into daytime. At 3 years, 25 to 38% of children wake up during the night, but after 5 years this proportion becomes negligible. Apart from acute or chronic diseases which may produce sleep disorders, most of these are due to environmental factors. Two syndrome are worthy of special mention: deficiency of slow wave and deep sleep in psychosocial dwarfism, and insomnia due to intolerance to cow's milk. Treatment of insomniac children rests on behavioural techniques: parents must be helped to understand and observe the sleep-wake rhythm of their children and teach them to acquire regular sleeping habits.",

      "abstract": "Drowsiness is common in those with DLB and PDD, and can interfere with thinking and memory, as well as quality of life. There are a variety of potential reasons for this, many treatable. Getting a little sleepy during a boring task or napping after lunch on the weekend is not a sign of a medical problem. However, daytime drowsiness should draw attention in certain circumstances: 1. More than one nap most days, or near-daily naps that span 2 to 3 hours 2. Falling asleep during conversations or eating 3. Frequently falling asleep during reading, watching TV, doing computer work or other vigilant tasks 4. Returning to sleep after breakfast These are signs that could indicate that nighttime sleep was not adequate (nonrestorative) but could have other explanations. Daytime drowsiness has limited causes: 1. Insomnia at bedtime 2. Awakening during the night 3. Insufficient time spent in bed at night 4. Poor quality sleep at night (despite adequate time in bed) 5. Daytime medications inducing drowsiness 6. A primary sleep disorder directly causing drowsiness (which may be DLB or PDD related) We will explore each of these possible causes and how they might be diagnosed and treated. If a person with DLB or PDD is excessively drowsy, at least one of these could be the problem. Inability to get to sleep at bedtime can translate into sleepiness during the daytime. Many people with DLB or PDD who experience insomnia benefit from nighttime carbidopa/levodopa doses. The benefits of carbidopa/levodopa dosing at bedtime for Lewy-related insomnia were addressed in Chapter 9. Various other factors, however, may contribute to insomnia. Sometimes medications taken in the evening are alerting. Such drugs include duloxetine (Cymbalta) or venlafaxine (Effexor), used for depression and often dosed twice daily. Elimination of all but the morning dose may allow sleep in such cases. Other drugs for depression from the Prozac class (SSRIs; see the list in Chapter 18) may also cause insomnia if taken at bedtime. A simple strategy is to simply switch to morning dosing on a trial basis. The tricyclic antidepressants, such as nortriptyline, amitriptyline, or protriptyline, should not cause insomnia; they may induce sleep. Occasionally, sleepy people are prescribed stimulants with long-acting properties, such as extended-release methylphenidate (Concerta), modafinil (Provigil), or armodafinil (Nuvigil).",

      "title": "An overview of drug therapies used in the treatment of dystonia and spasticity in children",
      "abstract": "Spasticity is defined clinically as ‘a motor disorder characterised by a velocity-dependent increase in tonic stretch reflexes (muscle tone) with exaggerated tendon acts resulting from hyperexcitability of the stretch reflex, as one component of the upper motor neuron syndrome’.1 Spasticity is a common feature of cerebral palsy (CP) as well as spinal cord and traumatic brain injury.\n\nThe most common cause of spasticity in childhood is CP which affects between 2 and 3 of every 1000 live births in industrialised countries.2 Other causes of spasticity include traumatic brain injury, spinal cord injury, central nervous system tumour or infarct, metabolic disorders and hydrocephalus.\n\nDystonia is defined as ‘a movement disorder in which involuntary sustained or intermittent muscle contractions cause twisting and repetitive movements, abnormal postures or both’.3 Dystonia may be either acute (eg, an oculogyric crisis secondary to drug administration) or chronic. Chronic dystonia can occur either locally (eg, writer's cramp, blepharospasm) or systemically as part of CP or other neurological syndromes.\n\nThe management of spasticity and chronic dystonia in children requires multidisciplinary management including neurologists, paediatricians, surgeons, GPs, physiotherapists, occupational therapists and pharmacists. Pharmacotherapy forms one aspect of this management and will be the focus of this review article, but other interventions, such as physical therapy, orthopaedic surgery and procedures, such as selective dorsal rhizotomy, play a major role too. Fundamental knowledge of pharmacologic properties and toxicities of these medications is required for safe and appropriate use, and should be part of an integrated therapeutic approach in which patients, carers, therapists, physicians and surgeons have open and clear communication about the overall rehabilitation process of the patient.\n\n### Oral/enteral drugs\n\nOral, or enteral medication, can provide systemic treatment for the relief of generalised spasticity via different pharmacological mechanisms. These agents can be combined in cases difficult to treat, although the …",

      "title": "THE EFFECT ON THE STOMACH OF STIMULATION OF THE PERIPHERAL END OF THE VAGUS NERVE",
      "abstract": "Stimulation of the peripheral cut end of either vagus by means of the faradic current will, if the organ be in a state of “hypotonus,” either initiate movements in the quiescent stomach, or, if movements are present, augment and sometimes accelerate them. A rise of entogastric pressure may accompany these movements. The contractions produced are indistinguishable from accentuated normal movements‐they are an exaggeration of the normal‐unless the stimulus be exceptionally strong, when a tonic contraction may result : from this, however, “escape” shortly occurs. The motor effect is preceded by a brief interval or latent period of some three seconds, and should the viscus be initially in a condition of “hypertonus,” this is followed by a period during which movements, if present, cease, and relaxation occurs. Augmented or initial contractions ensue later, but may be delayed until after the cessation of stimulus : there is not necessarily a restoration of entogastric pressure. The pre‐existing state of the peripheral mechanism governs the response to stimulation, the most marked results being obtained with the active organ, the least with the passive. The X‐ray picture on vagal stimulation shows that the effects on function are augmentor and accelerator: food in the cesophagus passes through the cardia, the waves of contraction are deeper than normal, and the pylorus functions rapidly, food leaving through the sphincter before every antral contraction. A brief preliminary relaxation may be observed. These effects remain unchanged by alterations of anæsthetics, decerebration, or splanchnic section. A vaso‐constrictor effect may be obtained on stimulation of the peripheral cut end of the vagus. The first part of the duodenum functions with the stomach and is controlled by the vagus in a similar manner. Stimulation of the intact nerve, the other being undivided, gives variable results, depending on the preexisting state, and on whether the centripetal or centrifugal influences predominate. We desire to make clear that our use of the entogastric pressure is only as an index of the activity or inactivity of the organ, and that by it we are endeavounrng to gauge the condition of the peripheral mechanism. We use the digesting or quiescent viscus in order to obtain variations in this state of the peripheral mechanism, and these are demonstrable by the entogastric pressure, latent period, and “response.” The majority of our findings may be summarised as follows:— 1. The primary effect of stimulation of the peripheral cut end of either vagus on the stomach is dependent on the existing condition of the peripheral mechanism (“tonus”), and may be inhibitor or augmentor. 2. The inhibitor or augmentor effect may involve both “tonus” and movement. 3. The final effect of stimulation is to bring about the augmentation of existing movement or to initiate movement. 4. “Tonus” and contraction may vary inversely or directly.",

Common sleep complaints during pregnancy include hypersomnia due to hormonal changes, as well as insomnia, often due to mechanical sleep disruption, particularly in the last trimester. RLS is also commonly seen in pregnancy, and typically resolves after delivery. During menopause, sleep disruption may be due to hormonal fluctuations or secondary to other menopausal complaints (such as hot flashes at night or sleep apnea).

In this article, we focus on the neurological complications of gastrointestinal, hepatic and pancreatic disease in adult patients.\n\nPancreatic function is essential for the maintenance of digestive functioning and hormonal balance. The neurological consequences of diabetes are well known and will be discussed in another review in this series. Hypoglycaemia due to insulinoma may present with a changed conscious level, epilepsy, stroke-like episodes, dementia or psychosis, or neuropathy. Shaw and colleagues1 described a 27-year-old woman with dystonic choreoathetosis. Symptoms and signs may be focal, mimicking structural lesions.\n\nAcute pancreatitis can lead to an encephalopathy, characterised by focal signs, cognitive impairment, seizures and hallucinations.2 Cerebral imaging is usually normal. Sudden blindness has also been reported secondary to a retinopathy (Purtscher’s syndrome)3 or optic neuritis.4 Acute pancreatitis may also lead to renal failure and an associated thrombotic microangiopathy characterised by confusion and seizures, and responsiveness to plasma exchange.5 Gross and coworkers6 reported four patients with pancreatitis complicated by severe axonal neuropathy. All these patients, however, required intensive care treatment and had been treated with metronidazole. Vallat and Vital7 reported on a single patient with encephalopathy and axonal neuropathy complicating a severe pancreatitis.\n\n### Malabsorption\n\nMalabsorption may occur as a consequence of primary gastrointestinal pathology (eg, coeliac disease) or iatrogenically after extensive resection of the small bowel.

With the updated concepts according to the latest meeting of experts in Rome 2016, our goal is to raise awareness about irritable bowel syndrome, by reviewing the literature regarding definition, classification, pathophysiology, clinical aspects, treatment, prognosis and the future. IBS is a chronic pathology, characterized by abdominal pain, at least 1 day per week in the last 3 months, associated with the alteration of the intestinal bowel habits. With a classification based on the alteration of intestinal bowel movements and in addition to constipation induced by opioids or narcotics, the etiology and pathophysiology are not well explained or well-known so far. The clinical aspects are based on the Rome IV criteria. A good doctor-patient relationship is key to reassuring the patient's doubts about his illness, which increases the chances of adherence to individualized treatment from patient to patient depending on the sing and symptoms that may manifest in those that include: dietary advice, psychological support, in some cases pharmacological prescription, suspension of medications or change medications, minimize the dose of drugs or suspend, according to the needs of the patient as is the case of opioids.

Se presenta el resultado de dos investigaciones. En la primera de ellas, un estudio caso-control, se analizo de forma comparativa como recuerdan el comportamiento de sus hijos durante los primeros 12 meses de vida los padres de 50 ninos diagnosticados de TDAH. Se separo la sintomatologia en 3 perfiles clinicos (irritabilidad diurna, trastornos en las conductas alimentarias y disfunciones del sueno). Hasta el 33% de las familias referia antecedentes de alguno de ellos. El 41% de los ninos fueron descritos como excesivamente inquietos, llorones o irritables, y muy sensibles a los ruidos y sobresaltos, y el 42,7% tuvo dificultad para dormirse o manifesto sueno intermitente y despertares con llanto. Para el segundo proyecto de investigacion, complementario al anterior, se diseno una encuesta anamnesica que respondieron los padres de 78 pacientes diagnosticados de TDAH. El cuestionario recogia la informacion sobre los primeros 5 anos de la vida en 4 apartados (28 items): las conductas durante el primer ano de la vida, el desarrollo psicomotor, el desarrollo del juego, y la percepcion general de los padres sobre su hijo (despistado-inatento, impulsivo, destructor, inmaduro, negativista, oposicional, otro).

      "title": "Consultation with the Specialist: Management of Status Epilepticus in Children",
      "abstract": "The definition of status epilepticus (SE) is a simple, prolonged seizure or recurrent seizures associated with impaired consciousness for 30 minutes or longer. There are two types of SE: convulsive and nonconvulsive. The latter consists of prolonged absence or complex partial seizures.SE occurs most frequently in patients younger than 1 year of age and those between 60 and 80 years. Determining the underlying cause of SE is of utmost importance and is directed by the clinical presentation. The differential diagnosis is similar in all age groups, although the frequencies change in the various diagnostic categories. Table 1 delineates some of the leading causes of SE in various age groups.The differential diagnosis in any age group should include both systemic and central nervous system (CNS)infections; trauma; hypoxia; CNS malformations; ischemic events, including stroke or hemorrhage; and toxic or metabolic causes, including electrolyte imbalance, alcohol use, illicit drug use, and inborn errors of metabolism. External and internal antiepileptic drug withdrawal also is a significant factor.The incidence of SE due to infection and congenital anomalies is higher in the pediatric age group. If a child is younger than 3 years of age,infection, hypoxia, or metabolic disturbances are the most likely causes. In the child older than 3 years, idiopathic epilepsy, congenital anomalies, or chronic encephalopathies are the more likely precipitants. Although usually benign, febrile seizures can progress to SE.Neonatal SE is challenging to diagnose and treat because seizures in neonates are usually subtle and not dramatic in appearance. Clinical manifestations include rhythmic eye movements, rowing or pedaling motions of the legs, tonic posture, or less commonly focal or multifocal generalized tonic, clonic, or tonic-clonic seizures. It often is difficult to correlate clinical seizures with electrocerebral epileptiform activity on electroencephalography (EEG). The decision to treat needs to be based on the underlying etiology of the seizures, background and ictal activity of the EEG, and consideration of the consequences of chronic antiepileptic drug administration.SE is associated with a poorer prognosis in adults than in children. Average mortality rates in one study were 25% for adults versus 2.5% in children. Alcohol and drug abuse account for a large percentage of cases of SE.Table 2 lists a classification scheme for SE. Convulsive,either generalized or partial, is the most easily recognizable form of SE. Nonconvulsive often is difficult to identify and to differentiate from confusional migraine and psychiatric fugue states. Cascino reported that 25%of persons experiencing SE have absence or complex partial SE.Important differential diagnoses in patients who have nonconvulsive SE (absence or complex partial), depending in part upon their age, include confusional states or unresponsiveness associated with transient ischemic attacks,transient global amnesia, stroke, or migraine. Toxic and metabolic causes should be sought early in the evaluation. One must always consider psychiatric disorders, such as various forms of psychosis, fugue states, and",

F. M. Russell. The clinical features of the eating disorders comprise features specific to these disorders and features more generally associated with psychological disturbance. The term \"anorexia\" is a misnomer because, except in long-standing cases, appetite for food persists. There is often an obsessional component to these patients' eating habits: they may eat exactly the same food every day, cut up their food into very small pieces, or engage in other ritualistic practices surrounding eating. The principal complaint of patients with bulimia nervosa is that they have lost control of their eating. A central feature of the eating disorders is certain overvalued ideas concerning the importance of shape and weight. A family history of affective disorder is common among patients with eating disorders.",

Epilepsy can cause many consequences, such as using long-term antiepileptic drugs.It is important to know when drug administration starts and the right drug selection. The choice of type of drug is mainly based on the type of seizure. Other factors to consider are the age of the patient and the existing comorbidities. In the course of efforts to achieve seizure free, sometimes the addition of drugs or drug substitution is needed. Absolute drug substitution is done if serious side effects occur to the patient. The other indication of drug substitution is if there is no improvement in the frequency and severity of the seizure.After a seizure-free period is reached, the next problem is when to stop the drug. Discontinuation of the drug has the consequence of the risk of recurrent seizures. But on the other hand, the cessation of AED in some cases corrects the side effects that arise from the drug. Some literatures suggest the termination of OAE begins after 3 years of seizure free. But when referring to the definition of epilepsy issued by ILAE in 2014, that epilepsy is considered to be resolved for individuals who have remained seizure-free for the last 10 years, with no seizure medicines for the last 5 years, then the cessation of the drug is carried out after 5 years of seizure-free period.",

      "title": "Bulimia Nervosa: A Psychological Eating Disorder",
      "abstract": "Eating disorders are multifaceted mental health problems which require medical treatments and counseling from a psychological expert.In extreme condition,these eating disorders can cause serious health problems and may be lethal if these are not diagnosed and treated timely.Eating Disorder Hope organization has conducted a survey which revealed thatalmost 40% of teen age girls were suffering from at least one kind of eating disorder while91% of young females do dieting to reduce their weight. It has been estimated that about one million males and ten million females suffer from various types of eating disorders. &#x0D; Bulimia nervosa is one of the eating disorders. It oftens develops in teenage or early adulthood.It is common in women than men. In bulimia nervosa, a person usually eats a lot in a short period of time. It seems that the personcannot control himself fromeating food. It happens until they are painfully full and then they will purge to end their discomfort and to compensate their calories. They will purge by forced vomitinglaxatives,diuretics or excessive exercise.Frequent self-induced vomiting can contribute to inflammation of parotidgland and can result in hand calluses. It is more common in families appearing in generations.There are many risk factors for this disease like being overweight/obesity, socio-cultural pressures to have a well tonned body, psychological impacts resulting in stress and poor self-esteem. Dieting has become a part of our culture. There are manysymptoms of bulimia. For example, patients live in a fear of gaining weight, they go through the repeated episodes of abnormal eating large amounts of food in single sitting. There is a feeling which develops in patients that they cannot control what they eat and what type of food they eat, and after bingering they are forcing themselves to vomit and do more exercise to stop weight gain.&#x0D; If we leave bulimia untreated it will cause kidney problems, irregular heart rhythms, digestive issues and dental problems etc. In time treatment and diagnosis of bulimia helps the person to recover well and quick and the person can get rid of this disorder completely otherwise it can be life threatening. A person experiences bulimia to manage the emotional pain he is undergoing but it only worsens the condition and the response may be to ramp up obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors. Nearly half of bulimia patients have a co-occuring mood disorder and more than half of bulimia patients have co-occuring anxiety disorders. Self-harm is a common condition affecting 34% of those with bulimia. Recent studies on bulimia show that in 10-15% of male members of our society who are living with this disorder, risk of suicide has increased. Statistics show that relapse of this disorder isvery common.Relapse is occurring in about30-50% of the cases, and it isleading to common cause of death in suicide.For treatment of bulimia nervosa, you may need to go for several types. Bulimia can be reduced by taking anti-depressants or psychotherapy, but using both in combination is more fruitful to overcome this disorder. Psychotherapy is very important for patients, in which the person goes to the psychiatrist to discuss the issues related to bulimia. Educating the patient on nutrition also helps in this regard. Anutritionist can prescribe the food by which a person will feel the cravings for food to a lesser extent. In severe conditions,the patient can be admitted to a hospital because sometimes there is a need fortreatment in a hospital. In many cases it is not possible to eradicate it completely.But before the situation goes wrong, we can guide a person to lead a healthier life with the help of professionally used treatments. Since we are living in an era where everyone is busy, it is important to guide and educate the children about a healthy lifestyle. There is a need to give them confidence about their physical appearance, no matter what their weight, size and shape is. Enjoyable family meals should be arranged on daily basis or regularly. Talks on physical appearances, body weight and dieting should be discouraged at home. Exercise, walk, activities like sports and swimming can help young generation to adopt a healthy lifestyle and streamline their daily life. If you observe that someone in your friends or relatives is having issues related to food which is indicating thathe or she can possibly has an eating disorder, you should talk to the person supportively and discuss the issue and help them in any way you can before the situation gets worse.",

      "abstract": "Anorexia nervosa is a syndrome with multifactorial etiology in which several genetic, biologic, psychological and social factors are involved. Patients affected by anorexia nervosa (AN) may develop multiple endocrine abnormalities, e.g. amenorrhea, hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis hyperactivity, low T3 syndrome and peculiar changes of somatotroph axis function. These endocrine abnormalities are also found after prolonged starvation and may represent an adaptive response developed in order to save energy and proteins. It is still a matter of debate whether these endocrine changes are etiologic or secondary. In fact, several evidences suggest the existence in AN of hypothalamus functional alterations, which may be involved in the development and maintenance of the food intake disorder; on the other hand, the increased CRH secretion seems to be secondary to malnutrition as well as GH hypersecretion coupled to low IGF-I levels; the latter is a common finding in AN, as well as in other undernutrition and malabsorption conditions, type 1 diabetes mellitus, liver cirrhosis and catabolic states. Hypothalamic amenorrhea, which is one of the diagnostic criteria for AN, is not linked only to the reduction of body weight but reflects also deep alterations of gonadotropin secretory pattern. Low T3 syndrome is frequently found in AN; on the other hand, an iodide-induced hypothyroidism is quite uncommon. T3 reduction in AN seems to be an adaptive response to prolonged starvation; however the presence of a simultaneous central dysregulation cannot be excluded. Finally, AN patients frequently show defects in urinary concentration or dilution with inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone, which may be due to intrinsic defects in the neurohypophysis or to abnormalities of its regulatory afferent neurons.",

Eine Obstipation findet sich häufig auch bei psychiatrischen Erkrankungen im Rahmen von Somatisierungsstörungen oder als Medikamentennebenwirkung. Weitere seltene sekundäre Obstipationsformen können im Rahmen von neurogenen oder myogenen Systemerkrankungen auftreten. <b><i>Schlussfolgerung: </i></b>Die Therapie sollte primär immer die Therapie der Grundkrankheit sein bzw. es sollte bei der medikamentös induzierten Obstipation ein Medikamentenwechsel so weit möglich sein. Symptomatisch können alle medikamentösen Verfahren wie bei der primären Obstipation eingesetzt werden. Konservative Verfahren, die je nach Grunderkrankung und Obstipationstyp angewendet werden können, sind Kolonmassage, Biofeedback, Irrigationstherapie sowie spezielle Stimulationsverfahren.",

      "abstract": "Parasomnias are physical, behavioral and experiental phenomena ocurring during entry or along the sleep or on arousal/awakening. The behavior includes movements, emotional, perceptual or dreaming experience, frequently containing manifestations of autonomic nervous system. Parasomnias are devided into primary (ocurring etiher in NREM or REM sleep) and secondary (following organic system disease manifested during sleep). Primary parasomnias are further devided into those that appear during NREM, REM or states of consciousnes that do not respect boundaries between wake and sleep. Parasomnias represent an example of \"dissocitaion of sleep stages\" with the overlaping of wakefulness and NREM sleep (confusional arousals, somnambulism and night terrors) or wake and REM sleep (REM sleep behavior disorder parasomnia). NREM parasomnias are a significant clinical problem that appears with functional reorganization of the brain as it transits throuh different states of consciousness. Aside from the above dissociation there are other physiological phenomena that render behavior more complex during sleep such as 1) activation of locomotor centers during sleep, 2) sleep intertia (confusion and desorientation during transition from sleep to wakefulness) and 3) instability of sleep stages (rapid oscilation(s) between seleep and wake).",

Neurogenic gastrointestinal dysfunction can manifest with symptoms of upper gastrointestinal dysmotility, resulting in esophageal dysphagia or impaired gastric emptying (gastroparesis), or lower gastrointestinal dysmotility, including constipation, defecatory dysfunction, and occasionally diarrhea. Upper gastrointestinal symptoms reflect involvement of the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMV), enteric nervous system (ENS), or both, whereas lower gastrointestinal dysmotility primarily reflects ENS involvement. The evaluation of these patients requires first excluding the adverse effects of drugs, and then excluding obstructive or inflammatory causes. The management includes maintenance of adequate hydration and nutrition, use of prokinetic drugs, treatment of superimposed bacterial infections, and, in rare cases, surgery.",

Achalasia is seen in the gastroesophageal sphincter. Partial or complete failure of contraction occurs most commonly in the esophagus. In dyskinesia, the progressive sequence of the contraction is lost, and the entire organ or a part of it contracts simultaneously. Too much contraction for too long a period causes diffuse spasm. Refinements in technics of detection should result in better definition of esophageal motor disorders and better management of patients.",

      "title": "Disorders of gastrointestinal hypomotility",
      "abstract": "<ns4:p>Ingestion and digestion of food as well as expulsion of residual material from our gastrointestinal tract requires normal propulsive, i.e. motor, function. Hypomotility refers to inherited or acquired changes that come with decreased contractile forces or slower transit. It not only often causes symptoms but also may compromise nutritional status or lead to other complications. While severe forms, such as pseudo-obstruction or ileus, may have a tremendous functional impact, the less severe forms of hypomotility may well be more relevant, as they contribute to common disorders, such as functional dyspepsia, gastroparesis, chronic constipation, and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Clinical testing can identify changes in contractile activity, defined by lower amplitudes or abnormal patterns, and the related effects on transit. However, such biomarkers show a limited correlation with overall symptom severity as experienced by patients. Similarly, targeting hypomotility with pharmacological interventions often alters gut motor function but does not consistently improve symptoms. Novel diagnostic approaches may change this apparent paradox and enable us to obtain more comprehensive information by integrating data on electrical activity, mechanical forces, patterns, wall stiffness, and motions with information of the flow of luminal contents. New drugs with more selective effects or more specific delivery may improve benefits and limit adverse effects. Lastly, the complex regulation of gastrointestinal motility involves the brain-gut axis as a reciprocal pathway for afferent and efferent signaling. Considering the role of visceral input in emotion and the effects of emotion on visceral activity, understanding and managing hypomotility disorders requires an integrative approach based on the mind-body continuum or biopsychosocial model of diseases.</ns4:p>",

      "abstract": "Similar to the adult patient, a child or adolescent may actively feign or produce artificial symptoms (synonymous: Munchausen syndrome). The more frequent case is that the child suffers from being an object of symptom fabrication induced by a close person caring for the child, regularly the mother (Munchausen syndrome by proxy). This review focuses on psychopathological aspects of the clinically more relevant factitious disorder by proxy. Typical behaviour and personality characteristics are presented that can be taken as clinical warning signs. Doctor-mother-interaction is affectively challenging due to conflicting tasks imposed on the physician. Complementary to pediatric exclusion of genuine disease, psychopathological assessment is required to exclude other sources of deviant illness behaviour. Factious disorder shares particular features (active violation of the child, false report of history, aggravated symptom presentation and increased doctor-hopping, difficulties in conforming maternal report in biomedical data) with other psychopathological entities (child abuse, simulation, dissociative disorders, somatoform disorders including hypochondria, variants of maternal overprotection and infantilization, psychosis or delusion in the mother). Criteria for differentiation are presented. Three concepts on the psychopathological etiology of factitious disorder by proxy are relevant: In some cases, it may be conceived as secondary manifestation of a primary psychopathological entity or personality disorder. Learning theory emphasises operant rewards received from vicarious sick role. Attachment theory provides possible explanations concerning the traumatic impact on the child, early sources of psychopathology in the fabricating mother and risks for intergenerational transmission of factitious disorders.",

Depression is more typically thought of as strictly biochemical-based or emotionally-rooted. On the contrary, nutrition can play a key role in the onset as well as severity and duration of depression. Many of the easily noticeable food patterns that precede depression are the same as those that occur during depression. These may include poor appetite, skipping meals, and a dominant desire for sweat foods. Nutritional neuroscience is an emerging discipline shedding light on the fact that nutritional factors are intertwined with human cognition, behavior, and emotions”.",

Metoda: Baza Medline została przeszukana w kierunku artykułów dotyczących niespecyficznych zaburzeń odżywiania się. Opisane zostały następujące zaburzenia: napady objadania się (BED); pica; zespół przeżuwania; unikanie / ograniczanie przyjmowania pokarmów; zespół jedzenia nocnego (NES); zaburzenia odżywiania się związane ze snem (SRED); bigoreksja; ortoreksja. Szczególny nacisk postawiono na diagnozowanie, objawy, współchorobowość, powikłania oraz leczenie. Wyniki: Wszystkie uwzględnione zaburzenia odżywiania się mogą mieć niebezpieczne konsekwencje, zarówno somatyczne, jak i psychiatryczne. Często również współwystępują z innymi zaburzeniami psychicznymi. Każde z wymienionych zaburzeń można zdiagnozować u kilku procent populacji ogólnej, od 0,5 – 4,7% (SRED) do ok. 7% (ortoreksja). W związku z rosnącą ilością danych z piśmiennictwa oraz zmianami w klasyfikacji DSM-5, klinicyści rozpoznają i leczą te zaburzenia coraz częściej.

Moreover, we can consider in this group those patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) who show a reduction of rectal compliance and those who produce \"inappropriate stools\".

      "abstract": "Non-pharmacological management refers to the management without the use of medications. Gastrointestinal disorders, especially Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders (FGIDs), are common disorders characterized by persistent and recurrent gastrointestinal symptoms due to abnormal functioning of the enteric nervous system where no structural or organic pathology is identified. FGIDs are associated with motility disturbances, visceral hypersensitivity, altered mucosal and immune function, gut microbiota, etc. To fully understand the pathophysiology of FGIDs, it is important to comprehend the biopsychosocial behaviour, which focuses on understanding and treatment of the illness and the subjective sense of the patient's suffering. Globally, the most common FGIDs (irritable bowel syndrome and functional dyspepsia) alone affect 16–26% of the population. The non-pharmacological management includes reassurance, lifestyle modifications including observance of dinacharya (daily regimen), gut hygiene, ritucharya (seasonal regimen), psychotherapy, dietary interventions like intake of pathyaahara, implementing sadvritta, the ideal code of conduct, performing yoga, etc. Since gastrointestinal disorders are highly prevalent and pharmacological modalities are limited in contemporary medicine. Thus, a non-pharmacological approach can be preferred in today’s era for sustainable results. Ayurveda follows a holistic approach and has never considered an individual's physical, physiological, and psychological aspects as separate entities. Hence, the management of different diseases has been given under three modalities: daivavyapashraya, yuktivyapashraya, and satvavajaya chikitsa. Thus, in the non-pharmacological management of FGIDs, Ayurveda played a magnificent role.",

Patients find it hard to trust professionals (as they find it hard to trust themselves) and present their situation in provocative terms (eg, \"I know what I need to eat; the only problem is that my parents are giving me a hard time.\") that ignore the cultural, familial, developmental, and physiological roots of the disorders and minimize the patient's own confusion. The impression projected by the patient that she is \"in control\" can make it hard to view her sympathetically. Being \"in control\" of an emaciated body or of chaotic eating is part of the problem. Unpleasant feelings, such as shame, blame, frustration, inadequacy, rage, and guilt, are felt routinely by patients, parents, and professionals. The risk of serious injury or death is great. The differential diagnosis includes many other serious disorders first presenting in adolescence. For all these reasons, the eating disorders are an important part of pediatric practice, and the pediatrician monitoring the patient's physical well-being and overall development is an indispensable part of the team. The eating disorders are \"model\" disorders, whose management requires understanding the physical, physiological, psychological, familial, and cultural dimensions of a teenager's life.",

New suggestions on its etiology include recent weight gain, weak abdominal muscles, and retained fluid in loops of small intestine. No treatment is of proven benefit, but treatment by weight loss, exercise, and prokinetics should be studied.",

We studied the eating habits of 105 hospitalized female patients within the context of a prospective treatment study on anorexia nervosa: 53% had achieved weight loss by consistently fasting, whereas 47% periodically resorted to bulimia. The two groups were contrasted with regard to their developmental and psychosocial history, clinical characteristics, and psychiatric symptomatology. Fasting patients were more introverted, more often denied hunger, and displayed little overt psychic distress. In contrast, bulimic patients were more extroverted, admitted more frequently to a strong appetite and tended to be older. Vomiting was frequent, and kleptomania almost exclusively present in bulimic patients, who manifested greater anxiety, depression, guilt, interpersonal sensitivity, and had more somatic complaints. This association of bulimia with certain personality features and a distinct psychiatric symptomatology suggests that patients with bulimia form a subgroup among patients with anorexia nervosa.",

From an anatomical standpoint dysphagia may result from oropharyngeal or esophageal dysfunction and from other structure-related or functional causes from a pathophysiological viewpoint. The prevalence of oropharyngeal functional dysphagia is very high in patients with neurological disease: it includes more than 30% of patients having had a CVA; its prevalence in Parkinson’s disease is 52-82%; it is the first symptom for 60% of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS); it affects 40% of patients with myasthenia gravis, up to 44% of patients with multiple sclerosis; up to 84% of patients with Alzheimer’s disease, and more than 60% of elderly institutionalized patients (1-5). The severity of oropharyngeal dysphagia may vary from moderate difficulty to complete inability to swallow. Oropharyngeal dysphagia may give rise to two groups of clinically relevant complications: 1. When a decrease in deglutition efficacy occurs, patients present with malnutrition and/or dehydration. 2. When a decrease in deglutition safety occurs, choking and airway obstruction develop, most commonly as a tracheobronchial aspiration that may result in pneumonia in 50% of cases, with an associated mortality up to 50% (1).",

It represents one of the most common causes of functional abdominal pain in the pediatric population. Various theses with little evidence tried to explain the pathophysiology of the disease. Neurological origin was one of the theories explaining the disease, either by the disturbance of neurotransmitters like dopamine, noradrenaline, and serotonin, which have some evidence of their relation to GI tract functions. Other factors like bio-psycho-social factors that affect the pediatric population are represented in bullying, unrealistic academic expectations from the parents, continuous educational stress, and difficult relationships with peers. Other factors may be genetic abnormalities of the receptors or visceral hypersensitivity. Treatment strategies for the disease varied from physical activity like yoga to a diet like a low-FODMAP diet. Pharmacological treatment of the disease targets the presenting symptoms, represented by antispasmodic drugs treating abdominal pain/discomfort, antipsychotics that regulate the disturbance in the brain-gut axis, and other drugs targeting diarrhea or constipation that present with the patient according to the type of IBS and the condition of the patient.",

Postnatal acquired microcephaly with a reduction of the circumference up to two standard deviations can occur by the first year of life. Infants can also have gut motility disorders and movement disorders including dystonia leading to scoliosis, choreoathetosis, and acute dyskinesia. While seizures decrease in frequency with age, patients rarely become seizure free. During seizure-free periods, patients may advance in developmental milestones but may decline during periods of increased seizure frequency. Infants may have normal to mildly abnormal development at birth but exhibit psychomotor plateau/decline following seizure onset, manifesting as hypotonia, spasticity, intellectual disability, and postnatal acquired microcephaly.",

Developmental defects of the neural tube, such an various form of myelomeningocele, which manifest themselves during the early stages of the intrauterine life, have an impact on the individuals further development. Its intensity depends on the extend of the defect itself, the feasibility of its correction (usually by surgical means) and a number of external, environmental factors which have an indirect influence on a child's development. The psychological consequences of such defects take the form of various disturbances in the development of cognitive processes: mainly the perception of the outside world and the formation of the cognitive structures involved in self-image formation. At every stage of his and her development, an individual of with a neural-tube defects is subject to many forms of social influence. These may either stimulate or hamper development. It is possible that mental development deficiencies observed in some individuals at a later stage result not so much from the defect itself as from the lack of appropriate social stimuli. The specific problems of children and adolescents (aged 13 to 17) with sacro-lumbar myelomeningocele have been discussed on the basic of a pilot study conducted at the hospital in Radziszów in the years 1996-1998.",

The pathophysiology of NVP is most likely multifactorial. Hypotheses include psychological factors, evolutionary adaptation, hormone alterations, genetic inheritance, infection, and gastrointestinal dysfunction. Differential diagnosis depends on the time of onset. Typically, NVP abates by 9–10 weeks' gestation. NVP is a clinical diagnosis of exclusion after other gastrointestinal, medical, drug-induced, or surgical conditions have been ruled out. Treatment begins with prevention which includes multivitamins and dietary and lifestyle changes. Acupressure at the Nei Guan acupoint has been proposed to alleviate symptoms of NVP. The combination of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) and doxylamine is the recommended first-line treatment for NVP. Persistent nausea and vomiting for three weeks or longer may result in a deficiency of vitamin B1 (thiamine) leading to Wernicke encephalopathy.",

Epidemiological data (frequency, sex, age) are examined so as the family histories of gastroenterological disorders. We take in account several pathogenic hypotheses, especially with reference to the alterations of gastrointestinal motility, which could be caused by several factors (psychological, prostaglandins, bile acids, etc.). The clinical picture is very variable, variations depending on the age of children and on the time of onset of IBS. The colic of neonate, caused by retention of air, is the main symptom in the first months of life, followed by chronic diarrhoea, also defined as toddler's diarrhoea, sometime alternating with constipation. In later childhood, recurrent abdominal pain represents a common complaint, in association with diarrhoea or constipation. The principal steps for a proper diagnosis so as the main differential diagnosis are defined. We explain the most important features of management (reassuring parents, free diet), excluding prescription of drugs, that produce only a transitory and symptomatic relief, so as elimination diets, that cause only a failure to thrive without any improvement of symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (AD/HD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder present from childhood and often following individuals into adulthood. It is the most frequent reason for referring children to mental health services. Core symptoms of AD/HD (inattention, impulsivity, hyperactivity) present behaviors that parents may rate in standardized questionnaires (e.g., does not study, memory problems, cannot concentrate, cannot stay still, has no motives, etc.), are also present in other developmental or psychiatric disorders (e.g., specific learning difficulties, sensory modulation disorder, mood or anxiety disorders, autistic spectrum disorders). This may cause errors in the differential diagnosis if clinicians do not add objective measures of cognitive deficits associated with each disorder. AD/HD presents neuropsychological deficits (compared to non-clinical populations) that are also present in other disorders, like deficient working memory, whereas other neuropsychological deficits are unique characteristics of AD/HD, such as sustained attention, response inhibition, and variability of response time. Likewise, anxiety disorders present neuropsychological deficits in autobiographical memory, mood disorders present neuropsychological deficits in processing speed and verbal memory. Neuropsychological tests such as the Continuous Performance Test, tests of reading phonetic decoding, and others, may improve the accuracy of differential diagnosis, differentiating AD/HD from other disorders, or revealing the comorbidity of AD/HD with other disorders.",

      "title": "Prodromal stage of disease (dementia) with Lewy bodies, how to diagnose in practice?",
      "abstract": "Disease with Lewy bodies or dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), particularly at the prodromal stage, is a complex disease to diagnose because of different clinical beginnings and variable paths in terms of clinical expression. Thus DLB can be entcountered in different input modes: mild cognitive impairment, depression, acute behavioral disorders, confusion and delirium, or sleep disorders. In the aim to better diagnose the disease, should be sought obviously to search for the key symptoms: fluctuations, hallucinations, extra-pyramidal syndrome, and REM sleep behavior disorder. These symptoms are more subtle at the prodromal stage (mild neurocognitive disorder) than at the major stage. Thus fluctuations can be cognitive, simply as attentionnal fluctuations, or of alertness, such as sleepiness or more frequent nap; the visual phenomena can begin by sensation of passage, sensation of presence, or illusions; the extra-pyramidal syndrome can be really subtle such as isolated amimia or rigidity detected only with Froment's manœuvre. The frequent accompagnying symptoms are autonomic symptoms such as rhinorrhea or constipation, or sensorial symptoms such as olfactory impairment. The clinician has to be aware of the frequent presence of geriatric syndroms, also at the prodromal stage and including: falls, orthostatic hypotension, syncopa, urinary troubles, depression, delirium (after surgery, during infection...). On neuropsychological tests, sub-cortical frontal syndrome is frequent, visual memory impairment, visuospatial impairment and visuo-constructive difficulties are also characteristics. On brain MRI, isolated diminished insula is to look for. CSF analysis is usually normal but sometimes with low Abeta-42. Dat-Scan and MIBG scintigraphy were not enough explored in this context. Thus, with every patient presenting a compatible input mode, the search for symptoms of DLB has to be systematic, in the aim to have an etiological diagnosis of prodromal DLB, to avoid adverse drug events (neuroleptics) and to optimize care for patients.",

      "abstract": "Schedule-dependent sleep problems tend to increase as the youngster moves from middle childhood through preadolescence and into adolescence. This is partly because the youngster becomes more independent and parental control over both the selection of particular sleep schedules and the consistent maintenance of these schedules across weekends diminishes. Even accurate descriptions of the existing problem may become difficult to obtain. Nevertheless, specific syndromes are common and may be identified and treated. There may be increased demands at both ends of the sleep period leading to later bedtimes, earlier wakings, insufficient sleep, and daytime sleepiness. Periods of wakefulness confined to one portion of the night (beginning, middle, or end) may occur if sleep requirements are overestimated. Insomnia coupled with trouble waking may imply a circadian phase shift abnormality or a 'school-refusal' variant. And, variable sleep difficulties may be seen in a youngster with irregular schedules and poor sleep hygiene. Guidelines to the understanding, evaluation, and treatment of these syndromes are presented.",

Many etiologies have been proposed, including enteric fluid and electrolyte imbalance, autonomic nervous system stimulation, ischemia and mechanical trauma. The evaluation should include a review of the athlete's training program and diet, as well as a review of any preexisting gastrointestinal disease. A stool examination for occult blood should be performed in the athlete who complains of diarrhea. Treatment begins with a reduction in the intensity of workouts, followed by a gradual return to the previous level of training after the symptoms resolve. In most cases, symptoms do not recur. Dietary manipulation or antimotility agents may be helpful in some athletes. Bloody diarrhea, usually related to hemorrhagic gastritis, can be effectively treated with histamine H2-receptor antagonists.",

Na skutek głodzenia dochodzi do zaburzeń funkcjonowania praktycznie wszystkich układów i narządów, jednak najczęściej pacjenci z AN uskarżają się na dolegliwości ze strony przewodu pokarmowego, takie jak uczucie poposiłkowej pełności, ból w okolicy nadbrzusza, dysfagia, nudności, wzdęcia i zaparcia. Mogą one mieć zarówno łagodny – czynnościowy charakter, ale również stanowić objawy poważniejszych powikłań, w tym schorzeń wymagających pilnej interwencji chirurgicznej. Ponadto dolegliwości gastryczne mogą utrudniać prowadzenie leczenia żywieniowego w AN. Opieka nad chorymi na AN wymaga współpracy wielu specjalistów z dziedziny psychiatrii, psychologii, pediatrii, chorób wewnętrznych, i dietetyki, niemniej jednak często z powodów organizacyjnych stworzenie takiego zespołu jest trudne.

Psychotherapy has been the mainstay of treatment and often has been unsuccessful. The similarity of bulimia to major depression has led to evaluation of antidepressant drugs for treatment of the disease. Imipramine has proven effective in reducing binging episodes, and further evaluation of antidepressants seems warranted. Phenytoin also has been effective in some cases, suggesting that bulimia may be a neurologic disorder analogous to epilepsy. Optimal treatment may be antidepressants combined with a nutrition/psychotherapy program.",

La demencia Alzheimer es la mas comun y sobre la que mas estudios se han realizado, pero tambien hay otros tipos como la demencia vascular, demencia frontotemporal y la demencia de cuerpos de Lewy. En el mundo hay unos 47,5 millones de personas con demencia y cada ano se registran 7,7 millones de nuevos casos. Existe evidencia que demuestra el problema de desnutricion que padecen muchas de las personas con demencia. Sus problemas de alimentacion son derivados del deterioro de las habilidades motoras y cognitivas antes mencionadas: se les olvida comer, no reconocen los alimentos, sufren disfagia... Una de las opciones para hacer frente a la desnutricion en estos pacientes consiste en iniciar una alimentacion enteral por sonda nasograstrica (SN) o gastrostomia endoscopica percutanea (PEG), especialmente en casos graves; pero su utilizacion es controvertida y presenta muchas cuestiones eticas. Cuando la alimentacion por sonda esta contraindicada o es inapropiada se deben encontrar estrategias para fomentar la ingesta de alimentos.

In those patients where a cause of poor appetite is not clear, common causes such as dehydration, pain and nausea should be addressed before instituting appetite stimulants or tube feeding.",

      "abstract": "The causes of dysphagia may be classified into neuromuscular and obstructive categories. Disruption of the neuromuscular control of swallowing may occur at the level of the central nervous system, the peripheral nerves or the pharyngeal and oesophageal muscles. Patients with neuromuscular dysphagia may be at risk of aspiration if they are allowed unrestricted oral intake. Examination of the mouth and pharynx should not be performed without anaesthetic support and full resuscitation facilities if airway compromise is a possibility, as it may precipitate complete airway occlusion. Hemiparesis, hemisensory loss, dysphasia, dyspraxia, visual neglect or homonymous hemianopia suggest a cerebral lesion. Abnormal, uncoordinated or involuntary movement may occur with degenerative, demyelinating or inherited disorders of the central nervous system. Bulbar palsy is characterised by nasal speech, tongue wasting and fasciculation, and an absent gag reflex. Pseudobulbar palsy is char-acterised by spastic dysarthria, a brisk gag reflex and jaw jerk, and emotional lability.",

Patients with REM sleep behavior disorder may kick and flail, scream, fall out of bed, or engage in complex behavior that emerges from the content of their vivid, fearful dreams. Patients usually seek help only after they have injured themselves or their bed partners during sleep. Serious physical injury is possible. Often REM sleep behavior disorder is associated with the use of psychotropic medication or with a definable underlying neurological disorder. In an acute form of REM sleep behavior disorder, there is a more sudden onset of symptoms as a consequence of a toxic or abnormal metabolic state, including alcohol withdrawal, or in association with the use or discontinuation of psychotropic medications.",

      "title": "Concussion in Sport",
      "abstract": "Concussions affect millions of athletes of all ages each year in a variety of sports. Athletes in certain sports such as American football, ice hockey, rugby, soccer, and combative sports like boxing are at higher risk for concussion. Direct or indirect mechanical forces acting on the skull and brain cause a concussion, which is a milder form of brain injury. Conventional neuroimaging (e.g., computerized tomography [CT], magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) for concussion is typically negative. Concussions involve both neurometabolic and subtle structural damage to the brain that results in signs (e.g., loss of consciousness [LOC], amnesia, confusion), symptoms (e.g., headache, dizziness, nausea), and functional impairment (e.g., cognitive, balance, vestibular, oculomotor). Symptoms, impairment, and recovery time following concussion can last from a few days to weeks or months, based on a variety of risk factors, including younger age, female sex, history of concussion, and history of migraine. Following a concussion, athletes may experience one or more clinical profiles, including cognitive fatigue, vestibular, oculomotor, post-traumatic migraine (PTM), mood/anxiety, and/or cervical. The heterogeneous nature of concussion warrants a comprehensive approach to assessment, including a thorough clinical examination and interview; symptom inventories; and cognitive, balance, vestibular, oculomotor, and exertion-based evaluations. Targeted treatment and rehabilitation strategies including behavior management, vestibular, vision, and exertion therapies, and in some cases medication can be effective in treating the various concussion clinical profiles. Some athletes experience persistent post-concussion symptoms (PCS) and/or psychological issues (e.g., depression, anxiety) following concussion. Following appropriate treatment and rehabilitation strategies, determination of safe return to play is predicated on being symptom-free and back to normal levels of function at rest and following exertion. Certain populations, including youth athletes, may be at a higher risk for worse impairment and prolonged recovery following concussion. It has been suggested that some athletes experience long-term effects associated with concussion including chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). However, additional empirical studies on the role of concussion on CTE are needed, as CTE may have multiple causes that are unrelated to sport participation and concussion.",

      "title": "EVALUATION AND MANAGEMENT OF A CHILD WITH FEBRILE SEIZURE",
      "abstract": "Febrile seizures (FS) are self-limiting and benign convulsions associated with fever, affecting children from 6 months to 5 years of age, most commonly in children between 12-18 months of age and last only few minutes. The international League Against Epilepsy (ILAE) defines FS as “a seizure in association with a febrile illness in the absence of a central nervous system infection or acute electrolyte imbalance in children older than a month of age without prior afebrile seizures”. There are simple and complex FS. A simple FS is a generalized clonic or tonic-clonic seizure, lasts less than 15 minutes and is not caused by brain infection or any other brain disease. While a complex FS is a focal or prolonged seizure and lasts more than 15 minutes. The child, either with a simple or complex FS is neurologically healthy. Evaluation of a child with febrile seizure includes medical history, family history of FS or epilepsy, physical examination, recent antibiotic therapy, recent immunization and day care attendance. Physical examination reveals normal neurological status as well as normal development of the child. In addition, signs for meningitis or encephalitis should be excluded during physical examination (e.g. stiff neck, altered consciousness). The prevalence of meningitis in children with FS is reported to be 1-2%. Management of a child with a febrile seizure includes maneuvers for cessation of seizure used as an acute phase treatment and evaluating the child for the etiology of the fever. Acute phase treatment includes appropriate lateral posturing with head extension, keeping airways open and administration of rectal diazepam. Intravenous diazepam is administrated while the child in the emergency room with a complex FS or febrile status epilepticus. When administration of intravenous diazepam is not possible, buccal midazolam is reported to be more useful than rectal diazepam. For a child with FS specific laboratory studies are not indicated except laboratory studies indicated by the underlying illness. For example in a child with diarrhea and vomiting laboratory studies for electrolytes are indicated and beneficial. Lumbar puncture (LP) is considered in children younger than 18 months because meningeal signs may be absent or subtle in this age group, while in children older than 18 months LP is considered only when there is a suspicion of meningitis. Brain MRI or CT is indicated in a child with FS if there is an increased intracranial pressure and history of trauma or a possible neurologic abnormality. Studies have not found electroencephalography (EEG) to be helpful in predicting the development of later afebrile seizure or epilepsy and that majority of these children have a normal EEG. For a child with a simple febrile seizure consultation with a neuropediatrician is rarely needed. In healthy children the consequences of FS are rare. As a first line therapy in a febrile child, antipyretics may be used as a symptomatic treatment after FS. However there is no reported evidence for prevention or decrease of FS when using antipyretics at the onset of fever. The use of neuroleptics or benzodiazepines after a simple FS currently is not recommended because of associated adverse effects, even though their use is reported to be effective in reducing the FS. However, if prevention of FS were essential oral diazepam would be used, because it is intermittent and has less adverse effects.",

      "abstract": "Definitions Developmental dyslexia, also known as specific reading disability, is an unexpected difficulty in learning to read that occurs in the otherwise normal child. Rudel1 suggests it be defined by both exclusionary and inclusionary criteria. Her strict definition requires that five criteria be met: 1) The child must have no major neurologic abnormalities, such as overt cerebral palsy. Affected children may and often do have \"soft\" signs on neurologic examination, however. 2) The major sensory functions must be normal; the child cannot be blind or deaf. Practically speaking, children who are blind or deaf or who have cerebral palsy may be dyslexic if they have reading difficulties disproportionate to their other academic and intellectual abilities. 3) The child should have no major psychiatric problems. Problems with self-esteem are often, however, a reactive secondary issue in the child who has a learning disability. 4) Normal intelligence is required, using either a verbal or nonverbal measure. Children who have dyslexia often also have language problems. Hence, verbal intelligence scores may not reflect overall intellectual abilities accurately. 5) Finally, the dyslexic child must have been in a social and educational environment conducive to learning to read. Several studies of inner-city school children have demonstrated that enrichment programs help some nonreaders become readers, demonstrating the importance of teaching techniques.",

Describe the role of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatment of apnea.\n\n3. Characterize the findings of long-term follow-up of infants who have apnea.\n\nAlthough apnea typically results from immaturity of the respiratory control system (see accompanying article in this issue), it also may be the presenting sign of other diseases or pathophysiologic states that frequently affect preterm infants. A thorough consideration of possible causes is always warranted, especially when there is an unexpected increase in the frequency of episodes of apnea or bradycardia (Fig. 1).\n\n\n\nFigure 1. \nMultiple etiologic factors that may contribute to apnea in preterm infants. IVH=intraventricular hemorrhage.\n\n\n\nCentral nervous system problems, particularly intracranial hemorrhage, can precipitate apnea in the preterm infant. Asphyxia, including transient birth depression, may cause either episodic or prolonged apnea. Malformations of the brain or less likely, the spinal cord, should be considered in an otherwise healthy infant who presents with apnea at birth. Infections (bacteremia possibly accompanied by meningitis) may cause unstable breathing patterns and should prompt the appropriate evaluation and possibly antibiotic therapy. In the older infant, the onset of a viral illness such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection sometimes is heralded by apnea, although the precise mechanism whereby RSV presents with apnea is unclear. Anemia, another frequent problem in preterm infants, whether iatrogenic or due to bleeding, is a potential precipitating factor. Blood transfusions have been demonstrated to improve irregular breathing patterns in preterm infants, although the risk of blood transfusion has limited its use as treatment for apnea. It has been assumed, although unproven, that enhanced oxygen-carrying capacity, as with red blood cell transfusion, may decrease the likelihood of hypoxia-induced respiratory depression. Other disease states that may precipitate apnea include metabolic disorders such as …",

Fatigue frequently presents early in PD, and its prevalence increases with disease progression, affecting up to 60% of patients. Fatigue has a negative impact on quality of life. Fatigue is often associated with other nonmotor symptoms, including sleep disturbance, excessive daytime sleepiness, and depression. Only a few reports have been published on the treatment of fatigue in PD (methylphenidate, levodopa, and pramipexole). Further well-designed studies, including physiotherapy, are necessary to develop more effective treatments for PD-associated fatigue. A number of patients with PD lose weight because of loss of fat. However, the evolution and determinants of weight loss are not well established. Possible determinants of weight loss in PD include loss of appetite, impaired hand-mouth coordination, difficulty in chewing and dysphagia, nausea, intestinal hypomotility, and increased energy requirements because of muscular rigidity and involuntary movements. Noticeable weight gain has repeatedly been reported after subthalamic or pallidal deep brain stimulation. Because low body weight is associated with negative health effects and a poor prognosis, monitoring weight and nutritional status should be part of PD management.",

OBJETIVO: contribuir para um maior conhecimento do profissional fonoaudiólogo sobre as causas, consequências, diagnóstico e formas de tratamento da apneia obstrutiva do sono (AOS), a fim de favorecer a definição da conduta por este profissional, seja ela, encaminhar para um diagnóstico, tratar (por meio de fonoterapia) essa patologia ou indicar o tratamento médico, seja ele, cirúrgico ou conservador. CONCLUSÃO: as possíveis alterações fonoaudiológicas encontradas nestes pacientes são: língua alargada apresentando hipotonia, palato mole com volume aumentado, dificuldade na alimentação devido ao aporte insuficiente de ar e ao bruxismo, possivelmente causado pela tensão e ansiedade decorrentes das noites mal dormidas. Outras alterações podem ser encontradas decorrentes do tratamento cirúrgico empregado em alguns casos, como a disfagia ou até mesmo alterações na fala e na ressonância da fala decorrente de uma uvulopalatoplastia. O enfoque do tratamento fonoaudiológico é a mioterapia dos músculos envolvidos, priorizando a musculatura palatal. Percebe-se que o fonoaudiólogo pode contribuir para amenizar os sintomas encontrados nestas patologias, proporcionando uma qualidade de vida melhor aos seus portadores.",

This is particularly true in my particular area of interest, irritable bowel syndrome, where patients′ symptoms are often not at all explained or only somewhat explained. This has sparked a research interest in medically unexplained recurrent abdominal pain in young adults. Contrary to lay opinion, physical symptoms such as recurrent abdominal pain are found to be unexplained by disease, even after extensive medical assessment. There is now increasing evidence that medically unexplained physical symptoms are a major cause of disability and place a very substantial burden on both the NHS and the economy in general. Recurrent abdominal pain affects between 10−15% of school children in the UK. In many cases, the underlying cause of the abdominal pain is unexplained. Stress and anxiety are commonly associated with this condition which has been termed ‵abdominal migraine′. These medically unexplained physical symptoms are sometimes linked to somatoform disorders or psychosomatic disorders.",

      "abstract": "Obesity is a risk factor for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), and typically results from caloric intake in excess of energy expenditure. Sleep-related eating disorder, a parasomnia associated with binge eating during the sleep period, typically with minimal recollection or conscious control, is also associated with weight gain. In some instances, sleep eating episodes may be induced by arousals related to untreated OSA that occur during sleep. A 41-year old male veteran with a medical history of obesity, post-traumatic stress disorder, alcohol use disorder in remission, vitamin D deficiency, hypothyroidism and chronic pain, who was prescribed gabapentin, aripiprazole, prazosin, escitalopram, levothyroxine, cholecalciferol, meloxicam, methocarbamol and nicotine supplements for these difficulties, presented with complaints of snoring, nightly sleep eating behaviors, excessive daytime sleepiness, fatigue, non-restorative sleep and 40 pounds weight gain over 8 months. The patient’s main concern was sleep eating which had been occurring nightly, for at least two years. Behaviors were characterized by getting up, going to the kitchen and eating whatever was easily available, without preferences for certain types of foods. The patient did not have recollection for these events in the morning. Nocturnal polysomnography demonstrated severe OSA with an overall apnea/hypopnea index (AHI) of 108.3/hour. Titration of positive airway pressure (PAP) was tolerated well, and the patient was prescribed AutoCPAP 8–14 cmH2O. There was no sleep eating behavior or other parasomnia noted during the polysomnogram. This case highlights the possible associations between sleep eating behaviors and sleep disordered breathing. When these sleep disorders co-occur, it is often difficult to identify which disorder is causal. Longitudinal assessment is required to clarify the effects of positive airway pressure therapy on sleep eating, and whether such treatment has a direct impact on body habitus.",

Certains d’entre eux comme les apnées du sommeil peuvent engendrer des syndromes tels la dépression, la fatigue, l’impuissance ou des déclins cognitifs allant jusqu’à la démence ou en constituer des facteurs de résistance au traitement ; de la même façon, le dépistage du syndrome des mouvements périodiques des membres inférieurs au cours du sommeil souvent associé au syndrome des jambes sans repos pendant l’éveil, peut permettre une meilleure approche de certaines formes de fatigue chronique, de dépression, de syndromes de glissement. D’autres perturbations au cours du sommeil constituent les symptômes clefs d’un syndrome psychiatrique comme par exemple l’hypersomnie dans la dépression saisonnière ou la dépression atypique. Enfin, certains troubles du sommeil chroniques telle l’insomnie au cours de la troisième décennie de la vie sont souvent les signes précurseurs d’une dépression qui surviendra vingt ans plus tard comme s’il existait un facteur commun à l’origine des deux entités pathologiques. De la même manière, une période d’insomnie même brève s’avère un prédicteur d’une rechute maniaque ou d’un épisode psychotique aigu. Apprendre à les reconnaître, les évaluer, s’en servir comme guides cliniques s’avère essentiel dans la prise en charge des patients de notre spécialité : dans quels cas faut-il systématiquement ou éventuellement demander un enregistrement polygraphique de sommeil ? Existent-t-ils et quelle est la valeur des outils diagnostiques moins contraignants comme par exemple l’agenda de sommeil, l’actimétrie ? Comment prendre en charge une insomnie dans un cadre psychiatrique ? Quel est le « bon usage » des hypnotiques ?

A report of a 59-year-old patient with SRPE is described. Turgid painful erections (five to seven episodes of tumescence) during the sleep hours caused pain together with burning and tingling sensations in the penis and perineal zone during the daytime hours. Swelling of the pubic and perineal area was recurrent. Sleep loss, chronic fatigue, mild anxiety, lack of concentration and decreased work occurred along with this condition. Polysomnographic findings indicated REM sleep fragmentation. Attempts to treat this condition with muscle relaxants or anxiolytics did not prompt an improvement of this disorder, but a single daily dose of gabapentin 300 mg in combination with 1 mg clonazepam at bedtime improved total sleep time and reduced full sleep erections.",

But as its features become more widely known it is likely to be increasingly recognized. It occurs in children of Jewish parentage, the majority of cases being reported from the U.S.A., with one from South America (Tyndel, 1955), and some from Montreal (Riley, 1955). The constant symptoms comprise: defective lachrymation (“crying without tears”); symmetrical, blotchy erythema following emotional disturbances or eating; excessive sweating; sialorrhoea; emotional lability; poor motor coordination; relative indifference to pain; and hypo- or areflexia. Inconstant symptoms are: intermittent hypertension; periodic vomiting which may threaten life; liability to respiratory diseases; frequent unexplained bouts of pyrexia; attacks of apnoea during the first year of life; corneal ulceration; orthopaedic changes (scoliosis, pes cavus); and epileptiform convulsions (Riley, 1952). The condition is familial, apparently being inherited as a simple recessive trait (Riley et al. , 1954), though an irregular dominant is a possibility (St. Martin, 1953).",

      "title": "Ajirna: An Ayurvedic perspective on Indigestion",
      "abstract": "Ayurveda emphasizes the central role of Agni (digestive fire) in maintaining overall health and well-being. Ajirna (indigestion) is a pathological state arising due to the impairment of Agni, leading to the formation of Ama (undigested metabolic toxins), which serves as a precursor to various systemic diseases. The primary etiological factors of Ajirna include improper dietary habits (Ahara), an unhealthy lifestyle (Vihara), and psychological disturbances (Manasika Bhava). Classical Ayurvedic texts, including the Charaka Samhita, Sushruta Samhita, and Ashtanga Hridaya, classify Ajirna into different types based on Dosha predominance, namely Amajirna (Kapha-dominant), Vidagdhajirna (Pitta-dominant), and Vishtabdhajirna (Vata-dominant), along with other forms such as Rasasheshajirna, Dinapaki Ajirna, and Vilambika Ajirna. The dysfunction of Agni results in three pathological states: Mandagni (weakened digestion), Tikshnagni (hyperactive digestion), and Vishamagni (irregular digestion), all of which contribute to digestive disorders. The management of Ajirna in Ayurveda focuses on restoring Agni, eliminating Ama, and correcting underlying lifestyle and dietary imbalances. Therapeutic approaches include Langhana (fasting), Deepana (appetite-stimulating), Pachana (digestive aids), and Vatanulomana (regulation of Vata movement), along with Panchakarma therapies and Pathya-Apathya (dietary and lifestyle modifications). This paper aims to comprehensively explore Ajirna from an Ayurvedic perspective by integrating classical textual references with evidence-based therapeutic interventions for sustainable digestive health.",

Insomnia or Nidranasha, is not just about being not getting proper sleep but it means that the nervous system has been weakened and reduces our ability to cope up with daily sleep. Insomnia is named as Nidranasha, happens due to vitiation of Kapha, Pitta and Vata dosha. Proper and deep sleep helps the person keep Energetic, Enthusiastic, does Brumhana, increases the Bala, increases vigour and vitality and most it keeps the Mind in stable state for gaining knowledge. Insomnia means inability to get sleep at night or inability to have a restful and sound sleep. Insomnia is typically followed by daytime sleepiness, low energy, irritability, and a depressed mood. Insomnia can be short term, lasting for days or weeks, or long term, lasting more than a month. Insomnia can occur independently or as a result of another problem. Conditions that can result in insomnia include psychological stress, chronic pain, heart failure, hyperthyroidism, heartburn, Alzheimerâ€™s disease and Parkinsonâ€™s disease, Arthritis, menopause, and certain medications, and drugs such as caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol. Treatment of Insomnia:- Panchakarma â€“ Taila dhara a type of Shirodhara is very much useful in combacting the Insomnia caused due to various above said disorders. So its a demand of time to know about the real sleep and the disturbed sleep according to Ayurveda and Mordern medicines also and effect of Taila Dhara Brahmi,Jatamamsi siddha) in treating Insomnia.",

      "abstract": "Abdominal bloating with or without excessive gas production and with or without abdominal distention is common, very bothersome for patients, and is poorly understood. Bloating can be associated with gastrointestinal disorders, nutrient malabsorption, and systemic illnesses. The origin of abdominal bloating is often unclear, though it is usually associated with food intake and bowel motility dysfunction. Often, food allergies, food intolerance, or food poisoning are considered by the patient or physician as potential causes for bloating. A common concern in the patient’s mind is that healthcare professionals will dismiss or misdiagnose their complaint. The limited understanding of the pathophysiology of bloating leads to current empirical management, and bloating is often characterized as a “functional” disorder. Bloating carries a heavy clinical, psychological, and economic burden. Proper diagnosis will provide the patient with peace of mind and lead to effective treatment. This review focuses on the mechanisms and management of abdominal bloating associated with different small intestinal disorders identified by non-invasive hydrogen and methane breath tests.",

      "abstract": "The treatment of the highly disabling disorder has been primarily symptomatic rather than curative. The likelihood of a lifelong course is terribly depressing to both family and child; many of the same dynamics develop that one sees in other disabling chronic illnesses such as diabetes, juvenile arthritis, and serious injuries. Treatment for the disorder is essentially the same as that for Tourette's, in that it is considered part of a continuum of all tic disorders that last over one year. In addition to medication to suppress the tics, behavioral programming and supportive psychotherapy are recommended to deal with the impact the disease has on the school, social, and family life of the child. Treatment for this disorder is generally aimed at the reduction of stress in the child's environment. The disorder should be monitored carefully for development of Tourette's Disorder or Chronic Motor or Vocal Tic Disorder.",

      "abstract": "The syndrome of delirium is one of the most common manifestations of acute illness or drug toxicity in older patients. Controversy surrounds the definition of delirium, because its manifestations are pleomorphic and its mechanisms poorly understood. The American Psychiatric Association, in its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, fourth edition (DSM-IV), emphasizes four key features (Table 60.1). The first of these is disturbance of consciousness. Patients with delirium characteristically are less aware of their surroundings and have difficulty focusing, sustaining, or shifting attention. They become easily distracted and have difficulty following commands or maintaining a conversation. Accompanying delirium is an impairment of cognition and perception not attributable to prior or progressing dementia. This is manifested by memory problems, disorientation, misperceptions, hallucinations, and language problems (e.g., dysnomia, dysgraphia). The course of delirium is acute (defined as hours to days) and fluctuating (patients may be lucid during morning rounds yet combative or confused at night). Finally, delirium in an individual patient has one or more underlying medical etiologies.1 KeywordsFemoral Neck FractureNeuroleptic Malignant SyndromeAcute Confusional StateDelirious PatientElderly Medical PatientThese keywords were added by machine and not by the authors.

      "abstract": "The digestive tract starts from the mouth and ends up in the rectum and anal canal. Digestive signs can range from simple temporary conditions to chronic, enervating diseases. Persistent digestive complaints or severe symptoms warrant medical attention. Homeopathy has a very important role to play in the treatment of Gastrointestinal (GI) conditions. Anorexia, Nausea, vomiting, biliousness, hiccough, gastritis, heartburn, indigestion, constipation, Piles, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), nervous disorders and many more conditions are treated successfully with homeopathy. Modern and deskbound lifestyle, tensions, nervousness, stress and strain, irregular sleep pattern, eating habits, smoking and alcohol, and so many other factors are responsible to exacerbate the GI condition. (a) A brilliant student preparing for exams turns up to the doctor with anxiety and diarrhea. b) Held up in a traffic jam trying to reach in time, but couldn't, ends up his day with a bad stomach and abdominal distress. There are so many individual instances in the day to day affairs and the good news is that homeopathy has the cure. It goes deep into the system and treats the cause. It cures by raising the body's immunity, so it can resume its natural functions. Every case of GI condition calls for study of the patients individual symptoms, emotional and physical aspects. Ten patients suffering from IBS will receive ten different remedies. Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) Irritable Bowel Syndrome also called colitis refers to a functional disorder of the colon or large intestine. It is an inflammatory disease, of unknown origin, characterised clinically by recurrent attacks of diarrhea with blood and mucus, left sided abdominal pain, heart burn, spasms and cramps and sense of abdominal distention, usually associated with constipation. It is more common in females between the ages 20 -40 years. Various factors like food intolerance, acute stress, anxiety may trigger the disease. Some people experience only mild symptoms of IBS. Others have intermittent episodes, where the symptoms come and go. Some of the patients may have severe and debilitating forms of the condition. Most of the symptoms of the IBS result from increased sensitivity of the intestines and movements of materials through the intestine either too quickly or too slowly. You may have one or more symptoms at any time. Possible aggravators of IBS may include stresses such as travel, social events, stressful events good or bad, certain foods and beverages including alcohol, carbonated drinks, high fat and greasy foods, change in work schedule, fructose(natural sugar in fruit), lactose(natural sugar in milk). The symptoms of IBS differ from person to person. Detail medical history is given by the patient which helps the doctor to analyse symptoms and decide treatment. Fortunately long and protracted history of bowel symptoms without significant deterioration in general health is highly suggestive of IBS. Abdominal pain and diarrhea with mucus is one of the recognized manifestations of this disease.",

We present a patient treated for Parkinson's disease in whom during the period of levodopa wearing off we observed a paroxysmal abdominalgia apart from other features of a typical movement disorders like: increasing rigidity, gait disturbances and tremor. Abdominalgia consisted of stomach cramps, with variable localization in epi-, meso- and hypogastrium. Rectal tenesmus was also present. The patient was treated with analgesics, spasmolytics and carminative drugs with no effect. Abdominal pains regressed after an intake of the next levodopa dose. The patient presented with other features of a gastrointestinal tract autonomic system dysfunction like: chronic constipation, preterm satiety resulting in food intake reduction and a decrease in body weight. There was no organic lesions of the gastrointestinal system that could explain such disturbances.

Contributing to the constipation are an intestinal musculature weakened by starvation, the centrally mediated physiologic \"slow-down\" of body metabolism in starvation, and the patient's voluntary fluid restriction.

      "abstract": "Las convulsiones son causadas por un ataque de actividad excesiva en el cerebro. Un niño que tiene una convulsión puede perder el conocimiento (desmayarse) durante un período breve, temblar violentamente con todo su cuerpo, tener movimientos corporales reiterados y poco comunes, sufrir crisis atónicas (episodios de caída), tener convulsiones mientras duerme o tener la mirada perdida.La epilepsia se define como 2 o más convulsiones en las que el niño no tiene fiebre ni ningún otro motivo médico para sufrir una convulsión.Alrededor de 1 de cada 4 niños con trastornos del espectro autista o TEA (ASD, por sus siglas en inglés) tiene convulsiones. Las convulsiones suelen comenzar en la primera infancia o en los primeros años de la adolescencia. Los niños con TEA que tienen un coeficiente intelectual más bajo o que no pueden hablar son los que corren mayor riesgo de tener convulsiones.Con frecuencia los niños con TEA tienen movimientos reiterativos y episodios en los que se quedan mirando el vacío. A menudo un médico puede detectar qué comportamientos reiterativos podrían ser convulsiones. Una prueba llamada electroencefalograma (EEG) puede registrar la actividad eléctrica del cerebro y ayudar a un médico a verificar la presencia de convulsiones. El electroencefalograma puede registrar la ocurrencia de una convulsión solo cuando el equipo de EEG está conectado al niño. No es posible detectar con un EEG las convulsiones que ocurran en otros momentos. A veces es necesario hacer un EEG durante un tiempo prolongado para ver si los movimientos o desmayos son convulsiones.La mayoría de los niños con TEA no necesitan un EEG. Es probable que el médico solicite un EEG si un niño tiene desmayos que el médico crea que son convulsiones o si el niño perdió recientemente destrezas de habla o de otro tipo. El electroencefalograma se hace generalmente cuando el niño está despierto y luego dormido. Hay distintos tipos de EEG; algunos se completan durante una visita más corta al hospital y otros se realizan durante toda la noche en el hospital o en el hogar. El médico decidirá qué tipo de EEG es adecuado para cada niño.En la mayoría de los casos, los medicamentos llamados anticonvulsivos pueden ayudar a controlar las convulsiones. Por lo general estos medicamentos reducen la cantidad de convulsiones, pero no siempre pueden eliminarlas. Algunos niños obtienen resultados anormales en sus EEG, pero no tienen convulsiones evidentes. Aún no está claro si los anticonvulsivos pueden ser útiles en esas situaciones.Uno de 2 tipos específicos de aceite de cannabidiol (conocido como aceite CBD) está actualmente aprobado por la Administración de Alimentos y Medicamentos de los Estados Unidos (US Food and Drug Administration) para el tratamiento de convulsiones en niños con 2 tipos de epilepsia grave (los síndromes de Lennox-Gastaut y de Dravet). El aceite de cannabidiol no está aprobado para el manejo del TEA en niños que no padezcan las afecciones específicas que se mencionaron anteriormente.Para obtener más información sobre las convulsiones, comuníquese con la Epilepsy Foundation (www.epilepsyfoundation.org).La información incluida en este recurso no debería reemplazar la atención médica ni el consejo de su pediatra.

The ostrich with its head in the sand is the proverbial symbol of denial. Since the denial mechanism stems from a very early developmental stage, it is perhaps not surprising that when frank denial is seen to any appreciable degree in adults, it is in association with serious mental illness.

      "abstract": "Summary Although delayed gastric emptying has been described in several functional gastrointestinal disorders, and appears to be especially common in functional dyspepsia, the relationship of this finding to symptoms and basic pathophysiology is difficult to define. The delineation of the interactions between delayed gastric emptying, on the one hand, and symptom pathogenesis, on the other, has been hampered by several factors. These include the limitations of the methodology itself, the extent of overlap between the various functional disorders and the sensitivity of gastric emptying to factors external to the stomach, be they elsewhere within the gastrointestinal tract, in the central nervous system or in the environment. In many instances, delayed gastric emptying is an epiphenomenon, reflecting the overlap between inadequately defined functional syndromes, shared pathophysiology or the activation of physiological interactions between the various organs of the gut. In others, it may imply a truly diffuse motor disorder. The disappointments attendant on attempts to alleviate symptoms through approaches designed to accelerate gastric emptying should therefore not come as a surprise. Pending the definition of the true significance of delayed gastric emptying in all functional gastrointestinal disorders, caution should be exerted in the interpretation of this finding in a patient with functional symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Irritable bowel syndrome is a functional bowel disorder with gastrointestinal symptoms (e.g. abdominal pain, straining, urgency, incomplete evacuation, nausea, and bloating) that occur alongside bowel function alterations (i.e. constipation, diarrhea, or both). Patients with irritable bowel syndrome may also experience comorbid anxiety and depression. Irritable bowel syndrome is common, with a prevalence estimated between 3% and 28%, affecting patient health and quality of life. Patients with moderate or severe irritable bowel syndrome generally seek medical care, whereas those with milder symptoms may choose self-management. Most patients with irritable bowel syndrome receive outpatient care, but irritable bowel syndrome-related hospitalizations do occur. The pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome is multifactorial (i.e. genetics, immune components, changes in the gut microbiota, disturbances in physiologic stress response systems, and psychosocial factors). Management of irritable bowel syndrome can include lifestyle changes, dietary interventions, counseling, psychologic medication, and agents that affect gastrointestinal motility. A number of therapies have emerged in recent years with clinical trial data demonstrating efficacy and safety for patients with irritable bowel syndrome, including agents that target gastrointestinal motility (i.e. linaclotide), gastrointestinal opioid receptors (i.e. asimadoline, eluxadoline), and gut microbiota (i.e. rifaximin). Linaclotide has been shown to significantly improve stool frequency and abdominal pain compared with placebo in constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (number needed to treat, 5.1). Asimadoline shows efficacy in patients with moderate-to-severe irritable bowel syndrome-related pain. Rifaximin provided adequate relief of global irritable bowel syndrome symptoms versus placebo for a significantly greater percentage of patients with diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome ( p &lt; 0.001). Management that encompasses all aspects of irritable bowel syndrome (gastrointestinal symptoms) and comorbid psychologic symptoms (e.g. anxiety or depression) is important for improving overall patient health and well-being.",

In addition, persons with insomnia are at higher risk of developing a new psychiatric disorder, particularly major depression, within a year of the onset of insomnia. Psychiatric disorders can give rise to insomnia, excessive sleepiness, or parasomnias (eg, nightmares or sleep terrors) (Boxes 11–1 and 11–2).. It has been estimated that a third to a half of cases of chronic insomnia are associated with a psychiatric condition. Changes in sleep architecture include a decrease in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep latency that is seen with depressive episodes, schizophrenia, and borderline personality disorder. Schizophrenia (psychosis) is a chronic psychiatric disorder characterized by both “positive symptoms” (eg, hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized speech and behavior) and “negative symptoms” (eg, affective flattening, avolition [limited goal-directed behavior], and alogia [restricted thought and speech production]). This disabling condition has a median age of onset between 15 and 25 years of age. Course is chronic with significant impairments in self-care, interpersonal interactions, and work performance.",

      "abstract": "Success at school increases self-esteem. Any difficulty will have consequential effects on the psychological health of the subject. The conditions now prevailing in the educational institutions (mass schooling without any individual orientation before the end of college) oblige the teenager to submit to teaching methods and to the school system. School can reveal the subject's personal problems (anxiety, phobia or depression), but may equally create pathology by not recognising the heterogeneity of individual development and differences in cognitive functioning. In adolescence, the ego is particularly vulnerable. Anything that may induce its instability can create behavioural problems (instability, aggressiveness, inhibition) or problems of thought (anxiety links, difficulties in abstraction). In order to cope with such a haemorrhage of the ego, the adolescent may have recourse to certain behaviours (e.g. use of drugs leading to dependence). So it is important the know well the links between school failure and behavioural problems or drug consumption because, in one way or another, by their sanction or by lack of motivation, these situations will lead very quickly to school disengagement, which in turn leads to the breakdown of the ego.",

The main sleep disorder that these patients may present is Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS), which is characterized by repetitive airway obstruction during sleep with complete or partial cessation of airflow. This alteration can have effects on the circadian rhythm of the sleep-wake cycle, such as a desynchronization of the light-dark cycle or endogenously desynchronized, resulting in: insomnia, fatigue, and poor performance in daily activities and symptoms such as insomnia or hypersomnia, common in patients with circadian sleep disorders, although there are other causes to which they can be attributed and that must be excluded before making the diagnosis of a circadian sleep disorder. In a patient without another sleep pathology, a daily record of activities, meals, exercise, naps, and bedtime is an essential tool to evaluate circadian sleep disorders.",

      "title": "Emotional Deprivation in Children: Growth Faltering and Reversible Hypopituitarism",
      "abstract": "Emotional deprivation can lead to growth faltering of infants and children. The mechanism(s) involved differ in that for infants the major metabolic problem is inadequate energy intake for growth. In young children it is likely that the emotional deprivation causes a syndrome not only of growth faltering, but with bizarre behaviors, especially with regard to food: hoarding, gorging and vomiting, hyperphagia, drinking from the toilet, and eating from garbage pails.. Other disturbed behaviors include, poor sleep, night wanderings and pain agnosia. The pathophysiology appears to be reversible hypopituitarism, at least for the growth hormone and hypothalamic-pituitary- adrenal axes. The review begins with an historical perspective concerning stress, children and growth and then moves to the issue of hospitalism, where young infants failed to thrive (and died) due to inadequate stimulation and energy intake. Refeeding programs at the end of World Wars I and II noted that some children did not thrive despite an adequate energy intake. It appeared that in addition taking care of their emotional needs permitted super-physiologic (catch-up) growth. Next came the first notions from clinical investigation that hypopituitarism might be the mechanism of growth faltering. Studies that address this mechanism from a number of observational and clinical research studies are reviewed in depth to show that the hypopituitarism was relieved upon removal from the deprivational environment and occurred much too quickly to be due to adequate energy alone. These findings are then compared to those from malnourished children and adoptees from emerging countries, especially those from orphanages where their psychosocial needs were unmet despite adequate caloric intake. Together these various conditions define one aspect of the field of psychoneuroendocrinology.",

One group of eating disorder sufferers in which the skew towards females is less is that of the youngest sufferers.

      "title": "Severe Functional Constipation in Child: What Is the Solution?",
      "abstract": "Functional gastrointestinal disorders such as constipation are very common in the general population, particularly the pediatric one. The incidence of constipation in pediatric patients ranges from 0.3% to 8% and from 10% to 25% among pediatric gastroenterological patients. The etiology usually (90%–95%) is functional, and only a few cases are diagnosed as having an organic pathology (Hirschsprung disease, neurologic and medullar pathologies, anorectal malformation, etc.), which allows for a specific surgical or medical approach. Most pediatric patients with functional constipation are successfully managed with more or less aggressive medical treatment (e.g., dietary improvement, behavioural training, laxatives), but a minority remain resistant to medical approaches and are prone to recurrent hospital admittances for manual evacuation, abdominal pain, and soiling. Persistence of symptoms in the older child or in adolescents can have devastating psychologic consequences on family and social life. Functional constipation is now well recognized to significantly impair quality of life (1,2). Frequently, when the medical treatment of constipation fails, the question of an etiological check-up reappears. We would test only for organic etiologies of constipation, which, when identified, would change management. For example, nuclear transit studies would divide patients in two groups: patients with slow-transit constipation and the others with functional faecal retention. Even when clinical signs are nearly the same, the results of medical management seem to be different, with better success seen with medication or diet in children with faecal retention than in patients with slow transit (3). A rectal manometry may be proposed to search for a blunted rectal sensation and to distinguish between functional and behavioural causes for constipation and colonic neuromuscular disease. It seems that rectal hyposensitivity is common in children with constipation, even if the clinical relevance of this problem remains unclear (4). Its presence will have implications regarding medical or surgical management and may be helpful as a predictor of surgical outcome (5). If we look at the results of surgical experience as reported by Woodward et al., the presence of rectal hyposensitivity could explain positive results to colostomy formation. Similarly, other authors report improvement in colonic motility after temporary diversion in the pediatric patient with severe constipation and rectal and sigmoid distension (6). Rectal biopsy is necessary to eliminate the diagnosis of Hirschsprung disease, but overall in functional diseases, rectal biopsy allows the identification of abnormalities in colonic histology and in particular in the myenteric plexus. It also contributes to the understanding of functional disoder, throughout difficult treatments, including surgical treatment in some cases. Generally, the main problems with functional patients remain abdominal pain, frequent hospital admittances, and psychologic consequences. In the first instance, treatment should always be medical. One cannot report all the medications proposed for treatment, and medications must always be associated with adequate dietary changes. Recently, neurotrophin-3, a neurotrophic factor acting on the development of the enteric nervous system has been reported to be effective in treatment of functional constipation (7). When first-line treatment fails, other approaches, such as psychologic ones or biofeedback, are appropriate. The use of biofeedback in continence acquisition in children with anorectal malformation is now recognised. Good results have been reported in the treatment of patients with slow-transit constipation (8,9), and it is probable that this option should be offered more often. It would be interesting to compare the results of biofeedback with the data from manometry to select the best candidates for the treatment. Psychologic therapy seems to be as important as medical treatment in severe constipation. In particular, a multidisciplinary approach shows therapeutic results from making rules and equalizing family roles, especially in functional constipation which relapse and devastating psychologic consequences are common (10,11). Finally, in a few pediatric patients, medical approaches fail and surgery is offered as an alternative (5% of patients with severe chronic constipation) (12). In adults, radical surgical approaches have been used including total or subtotal colectomy and ileorectal anastomosis. The results are satisfactory for stool frequency and quality of life, but postoperative incontinence or diarrhea has been reported (13). Similar results have been reported, always in adults, with segmental colonic resection (14). Such an approach has not been used in pediatric patients because of the nutritional consequences and the risk to growth. As reported for patients with spina bifida (15), antegrade colonic enema using a Malone procedure (cecostomy) has been safely used, with safe and satisfactory results (16). In the current issue of JPGN, Woodward et al. (J Pediatr Gastroenterol Nutr 2004;38:75–78) report an original and interesting preliminary study using left colostomy in such patients. The main interest remains in the originality of the pediatric population, with a “mini-invasive” surgery, simple colostomy, Malone or colectomy procedure. This article has to be considered a preliminary report, and research must continue to understand the results and to improve the response to reversal surgery by addressing the questions of when and how such surgery should be performed. In light of another experience previously reported (6), it would be interesting to study rectal manometry before and after colonic diversion. Intuitively, we suspect that colostomy will improve the quality of life for patients with rectal hyposensitivity. Overall, particular interest should be focused on the histologic findings of the colostomy site using specific antibodies with analysis to understand why these patients with normal histologic colon findings do so well with a colostomy: is it a partial form of chronic pseudo-obstruction? For example, recent publications have shown abnormalities in Cajal cells in some patients with chronic bowel disorders (17). Other authors have reported a deficiency of substance P immunoreactivity in the colonic nerve fibres of children with intractable constipation (18). In conclusion, severe functional constipation in paediatric patients remains an area requiring great investigation to aid in the understanding and care of these patients. Perhaps, in the future this condition, always considered as functional, will develop a histologic and organic support network.",

Following a recent stricter definition and classification, constipation and solitary encopresis are now recognised to be two separate entities. Constipation is characterised by infrequent defecation, often in combination with involuntary loss of faeces. Solitary encopresis most often occurs once a day after school hours. When there is no defecation, the frequency of encopresis increases, the abdominal pain becomes more severe and the appetite becomes less, until a large quantity of faeces is produced (often once per week). The physiology of the defecation and continence mechanism is complex and has only been unravelled in part. The multiple physiological mechanisms involved have a complementary and compensatory effect on each other. This makes it difficult to determine the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of these functional disorders.",

Several diagnostic criteria exist that evaluate symptoms and their duration, for example, the Manning and Rome criteria, but they are not always helpful in practice because of complex interactions between IBS and chronic pain syndromes. The condition is extremely common, especially in young adults, but symptoms can occur at any age. Emotion and stress are aggravating factors. Lifetime prevalence is estimated to be approximately 20%, but most patients never consult a medical practitioner. Treatment should be tailored to individual symptoms with dietary changes, exercise, psychotherapy and medication (e.g. bulk-forming laxatives, antispasmodics, antibiotics, probiotics and/or agents active at serotonin receptors).

      "abstract": "Abstract The irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a very common disorder of intestinal function characterized by variable symptoms of abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation and bloating. The spectrum of severity ranges from mild symptoms, not worthy of clinical attention, to intense and continuous symptoms associated with impaired health‐related quality of life and high health care use. Psychosocial disturbance is commonly found among patients with irritable bowel, but until recently, its precise role in the disorder was uncertain. The data now suggest that irritable bowel is not a psychiatric disorder per se , but psychosocial factors including life stress, psychiatric comorbidity and abnormal illness behavior, among others, influence how the illness is experienced and acted upon. Patients with mild symptoms usually respond to education, reassurance, dietary modification and, when needed, antimotility agents. However, patients with more severe symptoms, who usually have greater psychosocial disturbance, will also require behavioral interventions, and possibly psychopharmacological agents. In sum, a graduated, multicomponent plan of care that includes dietary, behavioral and pharmacological treatments is recommended.",

      "abstract": "Several Classical Ayurvedic texts describe Amlapitta, a common gastrointestinal system illness of Annavaha Srotasa. Amlapitta has been mentioned in several Ayurvedic writings since the time of the Samhita. Textbooks including the Kashyapa Samhita, Yoga Ratnakara, and Bhaishajya Ratnavali give detailed descriptions of this situation. Amlapitta is classified as a predominant sickness, or Pitta Pradhana Vyadhi. Amla pitta is character-ised by indigestion (Avipaka), a burning feeling in the throat and heart (Hritkantha Daha), sour and bitter belch-ing (tikta-amlodgara), gurgling sounds in the intestines (Antra Kujana), chest pain, and diarrhoea. The Vata Pitta Dosha is vitiated by overindulging in etiological elements, such as unhealthy lifestyles. When Pitta, Vata, or Kapha cooperate, the Jatharagni factor, which controls digestion, or Jatharagnimandya (diminu-tion of digestion), is weakened. Undigested food, or Vidagdha, is consumed during this stage. It eventually be-comes Shukta (acidified) and stays in the stomach for a long time. At this point, the premonitory sign of Am-lapitta sickness, indigestion from acidified chyle, or Vidagdhajirna, appears. Furthermore, Pitta Amavisha Sammurchana, a mixture of undigested food and unmetabolised Rasa, is the out-come of vitiated Pitta and Shukta. We call this condition Amlapitta.",

      "title": "Some Psychosomatic Aspects of Food Allergy",
      "abstract": "Summary Some patients experience untoward idiosyncratic reactions when they eat certain wholesome foods. Such illness may be caused by psychogenic or allergenic mechanisms, or by both. The relative importance of psychogenic and allergenic factors in the production and continuance of food-induced illness must be estimated correctly in order to plan a correct program of therapy. This paper reports some of my experiences with the treatment of about 600 patients (seen in the past ten years) who had certain food-induced syndromes, with or without associated primary neuropsychiatric disturbances. Foods become endowed with various dynamic emotional meanings according to the person's upbringing, cultural and religious training, and personal life experiences. Psychogenic food reactions may include anger, anxiety, anorexia, depression, euphoria, feelings of security, guilt, hostility, passive-dependent attitudes, pleasure, syncope, and relaxation. The most common untoward idiosyncratic psychosomatic reactions to food include nausea, vomiting, epigastric discomfort or pain, intestinal cramps, aerophagia, belching, and rarely diarrhea--all being part of the riddance reaction. The symbolic supportive values of certain foods are such that a person may overeat these foods when he is subjected to unusual emotional stresses. Such categories of foods include the \"security,\" \"reward,\" and \"pleasurable association\", foods. An individual may eat excessive amounts of these foods during times of emotional stress, even though they may be the very ones which produce his allergic illness. The fixed food allergy is very well known, but relatively uncommon. The variable food allergy is very common, but not very well known. In the variable food allergy, tolerance for a given food may vary so that at some times small amounts of the offending food will cause an allergic reaction. But at other times the amount of this food which must be ingested to cause an allergic reaction may be very much greater than any amount that the patient would ordinarily eat. Allergic reactions following the ingestion of offending foods have certain characteristics: there is a latent period between ingestion of the food and the appearance of signs and symptoms; the allergic syndrome has a certain pattern of development and regression of signs and symptoms; it has intensity and duration. These properties in part determine the nature of allergic reactions to repeated ingestion of subthreshold and threshold doses of offending foods. With brief postcibal allergic reactions, each ingestion of a threshold dose of offending food is followed by a discrete reaction. Usually there is no summation of subclinical effects produced by ingestion of repeated subthreshold doses. Repeated daily ingestion of threshold doses of foods which give prolonged postcibal allergic reactions will cause a clinical pattern of allergic reaction resulting from summation, fusion, and adaptation to each individual allergic insult, until finally many patients may develop a steady state of allergic reaction. The daily ingestion of subthreshold doses of such foods is capable of causing a clinically obvious allergic reaction through virtual summation of clinically inapparent allergic reactions caused by ingestion of each subthreshold dose. Each primary allergic reaction set off by ingestion of an unknown allergenic food actuates a secondary postnoxious pattern of behavior which becomes an important part of the patient's reaction to the offending food. But if a patient knows he is eating an allergenic food which will make him sick in a specific way, he does not develop the secondary postnoxious behavior pattern. Recurrent episodes of spontaneous food-induced allergic illness occurring at unpredictable intervals cause certain patterns of conditioned responses in humans. Not knowing when he will be well or sick acts as a frustrating cue, in response to which a patient develops the human counterpart of the non-problem-solving behavior described by Maier for frustrated rats. These secondary reaction patterns of behavior often become so prominent and extensive a part of the patient's complaints to the doctor that even an astute allergist at first glance may consider mistakenly that the patient's problems are purely psychiatric. But further careful clinical study of such a patient will show that he is experiencing a primary allergic reaction to an offending food, which in turn sets off a chain of behavior patterns which are the patient's unconscious response to his allergic illness. Sometimes the secondary behavior patterns engendered by intermittent allergic episodes may become so incapacitating to the patient that they constitute his chief health problem. The food-induced allergic mental, fatigue, and pain syndromes are described. These may occur singly or in any combination, and may be associated with any other allergic syndromes. The patient's response to combined allergic and psychological therapy is illustrated by three case reports. As a result of psychotherapy alone, a patient may unconsciously modify his diet so that he includes less of the security, reward, and pleasurable association foods. If he is also allergic to these foods, he will have a remission in his illness as an indirect consequence of psychotherapy. Many patients are relieved of allergic ill health when they abstain from known offending foods. However, some of these patients will have conscious or unconscious needs at certain times to eat allergenic foods which they know will make them sick. The subtle nature of food-induced self-injury readily escapes the attention of the patient's family and friends--and even, sometimes, of his unsuspecting physician. Self-inflicted, food-induced allergic illness can become a recurrent problem until the physician can understand the basic psychodynamics of such self-injurious behavior, and can then help the patient to make better adjustments to life problems. The best management of all patients with food allergies requires both expert allergic therapy and expert psychotherapy.",

      "abstract": "About 1 in 4 infants comes forward with prolonged crying, agitation, or infant colic (IC) during the first three months of life and is referred for medical evaluation. The pathogenesis remains poorly understood, as do its implications for future health. The aim of this narrative review was to critically examine and discuss the available literature on long-term consequences of excessive crying and/or colic. Most studies display an association between IC and the onset of functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) years later, probably related to the presence of common etiopathogenetic factors (environmental, dietary, intestinal dysmotility, visceral hypersensitivity). Although allergic disease in first-degree relatives may be a risk factor for IC, the latter does not appear to be a risk factor for subsequent atopic disease in the individual. Overall, there seems to be a relationship between IC and subsequent headaches, of the migraine type. Similarly, behavioral problems in children with a history of IC appear to be associated with higher parental stress scores. However, the current evidence is based on associations, and currently, a causal relationship between excessive crying and IC and long-term consequences remains not documented.",

Early spontaneous remissions have been well described but most such remissions occurred within the first few months following neuroleptic withdrawal, and no published studies have followed patients for more than 2 years to evaluate permanence of remission. Over the last 12 years, we studied six patients with TD who, on prolonged follow-up, were found to have complete remission of their abnormal movements after a neuroleptic-free period of more than 2 years (2-5 years). All six patients were 61 years old or younger when their TD was diagnosed and their neuroleptics withdrawn. In five of the patients, remission occurred while the patients were not taking medication for the movements, while one patient had been on long-term, high-dose (2 mg/day) reserpine therapy for more than 3 years. The incidence of late remission of TD is not known and cannot be estimated from these selected patients, but these cases demonstrate that persistence of abnormal movements of TD for 2 or more years following neuroleptic withdrawal does not imply permanence in all patients. We suggest that TD be considered a persistent rather than an invariably permanent disorder.",

Faintness was induced by alimentary hypoglycemia related to gastrectomy performed 5 years previously. Lightheadedness and syncope were accounted for by autonomic nervous failure combined with an impairment of α1-adrenoceptor in vasoconstriction and the carotid sinus hypersensitivity which accompanied preceding events such as abdominal pain, defecation and micturition, which could enhance the vagally-mediated baroreceptor reflex.

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Individuals with TANGO2-related metabolic encephalopathy and arrhythmias can present in acute metabolic crisis (hypoglycemia, elevated lactate, mild hyperammonemia) or with developmental delay, regression, and/or seizures. The acute presentation varies from profound muscle weakness, ataxia, and/or disorientation to a comatose state. Individuals can present with intermittent acute episodes of rhabdomyolysis. The first episode of myoglobinuria has been known to occur as early as age five months. Acute renal tubular damage due to myoglobinuria can result in acute kidney injury and renal failure. During acute illness, transient electrocardiogram changes can be seen; the most common is QT prolongation. Life-threatening recurrent ventricular tachycardia or torsade de pointes occurs primarily during times of acute illness. Individuals who do not present in metabolic crises may present with gait incoordination, progressively unsteady gait, difficulty with speech, or clumsiness. Intellectual disability of variable severity is observed in almost all individuals. Seizures are observed outside the periods of crises in more than 75% of individuals. Hypothyroidism has been reported in more than one third of individuals. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of TANGO2-related metabolic encephalopathy and arrhythmias is established in a proband by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in TANGO2 on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Prevention of primary manifestations: Avoidance of triggers for acute metabolic crisis (e.g., prolonged fasting, dehydration, ketogenic diet). Infusion of intravenous glucose during significant acute periods of systemic metabolic stress caused by infection or general anesthesia may be required to prevent significant catabolism. Prevention of secondary complications: Provide hydration and alkalinization of the urine during an attack of rhabdomyolysis and myoglobinuria to prevent renal failure. An emergency plan should be in place to initiate steps to suppress acute catabolism and promote hydration in order to minimize the risk of life-threatening rhabdomyolysis and cardiac arrhythmias. Prior to determining the rate and amount of fluid administration, an echocardiogram to assess cardiac function should be considered. Surveillance: Regular cardiology evaluation for management of cardiac arrhythmias; annual TSH and free T4; neurology follow up to manage epilepsy. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Fasting; dehydration; ketogenic diet, which can precipitate severe metabolic crises. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of apparently asymptomatic older and younger sibs of an affected individual by molecular genetic testing to allow prompt initiation of treatment and preventive measures. Genetic counseling TANGO2-related metabolic encephalopathy and arrhythmias is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Once the TANGO2 pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

Achalasia is the best characterized motility disorder, yet the etiological agent behind the disorder is unknown. Diffuse esophageal spasm (DES) is a motility disorder characterized by simultaneous esophageal contractions intermixed with more normal sequences. High pressure or \"nutcracker\" esophagus is characterized by normally transmitted peristaltic waves with higher than expected amplitudes. Treatment of these disorders focuses on lowering the LES pressure and may include medications (nitrates and calcium blockers), injectables (Botox), endoscopic dilation and surgical myotomy. There is another set of disorders characterized by absent or weak (ineffective) motility. Scleroderma is the classic disorder in this category, but more patients have GERD and other conditions affecting esophageal muscles or nerves. GERD is perhaps the most common etiology of a \"weak\" esophagus. There are no specific treatment for ineffective peristalsis, but since many of these patients have coexisting GERD, acid suppression is reasonable.",

      "abstract": "Background and Summary: Traditionally, functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID), including functional dyspepsia or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), are defined by more or less specific symptoms and the absence of structural or biochemical abnormalities that cause these symptoms. This concept is now considered to be outdated; if appropriate tests are applied, structural or biochemical abnormalities that explain or cause the symptoms may be found in many patients. Another feature of FGID are the highly prevalent psychiatric comorbidities, such as depression and anxiety. It is implied that mood disorders \"cause\" gastrointestinal symptoms. In fact, epidemiological data now provide strong evidence that in subsets of cases, gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms arise first and mood disorders occur later, while in other patients the reverse appears to happen. Possible mechanisms for gut-brain dysfunction have been identified, with systemic minimal inflammation as a causal factor in at least some subjects. Other mechanisms that play a role in FGID include chronic infections, intestinal microbiota, low-grade mucosal inflammation including the increase of eosinophils, systemic immune activation, altered intestinal permeability, in diarrhea predominant IBS altered bile salt metabolism, abnormalities in the serotonin metabolism and genetic factors. All these factors might be modulated by environmental factors such as diet. Key Messages: While a number of factors can be linked to specific symptoms (e.g., pain or diarrhea), it is evident that the symptom-based categorization of patients will not allow targeted treatments that specifically address the underlying pathophysiology.",

Up to 60% of these patients is also suffering from psychosocial problems. Therefore it is important to define the patient's complaints in terms of a biopsychosocial disorder, to acknowledge the relevance of the psychosocial aspects and to provide an integrated psychosomatic treatment or a psychotherapy if indicated. Most of the research on psychotherapy in FGID to date has focused on the irritable bowel syndrome and different methods of treatments were studied (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy, dynamic psychotherapy, hypnotherapy, and relaxation). Randomised controlled studies have shown that psychotherapy is superior to conventional medical therapy. Hypnotherapy is successful not only for irritable bowel syndrome but also for functional dyspepsia. Predictors of a positive response to psychological treatment generally are: (1) awareness that stress exacerbates their bowel symptoms, (2) at least mild anxiety or depression, (3) the predominant bowel symptom is abdominal pain or diarrhea and not constipation, (4) the abdominal pain waxes and wanes in response to eating, defecation, or stress rather than being constant pain, and 5) the symptoms are of relatively short duration. Benefits persist over years, and in the long run, clinic visits and health care costs can be reduced.",

Lijecenje takvih bolesnika je dugotrajno i\npredstavlja multidisciplinaran pristup. Bulimija je poremecaj vezan uz\nhranjenje koji je, kao i anoreksija nervoza, psiholoskog podrijetla, a može\nimati strasne tjelesne posljedice. Dok se anoreksicari jednostavno\nizgladnjuju, bulimicari se „ciste“ povracanjem koje su sami izazvali.

      "title": "STRESS COMBINED WITH EXTINCTION PREVENTS COCAINE RELAPSE BY DISRUPTING MEMORY",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Drug addiction is a chronic and recurrent brain disease. Addictive substances can cause changes in brain circuits and may be integrated into the memory system. Drug addiction consists of different phases, beginning when recreational use escalates to compulsive use and then cycles through withdrawal, and relapse. A relapse is a return to drinking or drug use after attempts have previously been made to stop. The prevention of relapses is perhaps the most fundamental task in addiction recovery. Repeated retrieval by the cue without reward stimulant reduces the behavioral response through a process called extinction. This learning is the fundamental principle underlying many cognitive- behavioral psychotherapeutic treatments. Yet behavioral change may be difficult to sustain, and relapse is not uncommon, even after successful treatment. Memory updating was applied to substance use problems by weakening the ability of drug-associated triggers to elicit substance use[1]. Stress can potentially affect all cognitive phases involved in memory function such as the process of memory storage, retrieval or/and consolidation. Stress prior to extinction might not only enhance the consolidation of extinction memory, like post-extinction stress does, but also make it less context- dependent[2]. Aims &amp; Objectives 1) Whether stress combined with extinction learning disrupts consolidated memory to suppress cocaine relapse. 2) What is the mechanism of stress combined with extinction learning suppressing drug seeking behavior. Method The self-administration of cocaine was used as an animal model for addictive memory. A combination of techniques, including immunofluorescence, fiber optic recording, brain slice patch-clamp recordings, and Golgi staining, was employed to explore the mechanism of stress combined with extinction in addictive memory. Results (1) The drug-priming test following self-administration extinction training suggested that rats exposed to footshock before extinction training (FE group) had a lower number of active nosepokes compared to extinction group (E group). Interestingly, in conditioned place avoidance test, footshock did not elicit an aversive response. (2) Fiber optic recording results showed excitatory neuron in LHb were more active in FE group during drug-priming test. Electrophysiological in vitro results suggested a significant increase in action potential firing and reduction of the threshold of the injected current to trigger the action potential in LHb. (3) Chemogenetic activation of neuron activity in LHb combined with extinction training effectively facilitated the elimination of cocaine addiction memory and reduced psychological craving. (4) Chemogenetic activation of neuron activity in LHb increased cfos expression in RMTg. Activation of LHb-RMTg also facilitated extinction and inhibited relapse. Activation of LHb-RMTg circuit could mimic the effect of stress combined with extinction in inhibiting relapse. Discussion &amp; Conclusion This study demonstrateed that stress combination with extinction training may promote the extinction of addictive memory and inhibit relapse by reshaping activity of neurons in the LHb-RMTg circuit.

These disorders can be linked to difficulties in managing emotions and require comprehensive treatment for successful recovery. Teenagers often struggle with emotional regulation, worsening symptoms and affecting their mental health. Intense emotions like anxiety, sadness, or frustration may lead to problematic eating behaviors as a coping mechanism. Moreover, individuals with an eating disorder tend to ruminate on emotions and avoid emotional experiences, contributing to the disorder’s persistence. Therapies focusing on emotional regulation have shown promising results in treating eating disorders.",

Bulimia nervosa (BN) is an eating disorder manifested by binge eating attacks followed by recurrent inappropriate compensatory behaviours, such as self-induced vomiting and excessive exercise. Dysphagia, regurgitation, vomiting, retrosternal pain, heartburn, weight loss, avoidance of eating, consumption of large amount of liquids and aberrant eating behaviours are symptoms of both achalasia and BN. Owing to these common signs and symptoms, oesophageal achalasia can be misdiagnosed as an eating disorder. In addition, oesophageal achalasia can occur as a complication of BN. It is often difficult to distinguish organic and psychological vomiting or comorbidity because of overlapping of the symptoms.We report the case of a patient who developed oesophageal achalasia following severe, repetitive vomiting as a complication of BN.We want to raise awareness regarding the development of a medical illness in the presence of a psychiatric disorder. Importantly, physicians should have a fundamental knowledge of these two diseases regarding their clinical patterns to differentially diagnose one or both disorders as quickly as possible.",

      "title": "Posttraumatic Stress Disorder",
      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an intense and disabling response to a traumatic event. Acute PTSD occurs 1 to <3 months following the event, whereas chronic PTSD persists for 3 months or longer. The symptoms fall primarily into three clusters. The first includes reexperiencing the event. This reaction manifests clinically as distressing memories, nightmares, or the more extreme \"flashbacks\" to the event itself. During reexposure (either from internal cues such as reexperiencing in the mind, or external, such as visiting the scene of the accident), the person suffers from intense anxiety and distress. The second cluster can, to some extent, be seen as a reaction to the first. This response is characterized by avoidance of reexposure to the trauma and numbing to the psychological responses the exposure creates, including a more generalized emotional numbing. The third symptom cluster involves a constant hyperalert state. The person may have difficulty falling or staying asleep, may have an increased startle response, may have more trouble concentrating, and may be more generally irritable or angry.Approximately 70% of children have had exposure to a traumatic event before age 16 years; however, despite the large amount of exposure, the 6-month prevalence of PTSD in these patients is ∼3.7% for boys and 6.3% for girls. Protective factors against PTSD include, in descending order of importance, connections to positive caretakers, feelings of self-worth, feelings of hope, importance to others, talents valued by others, religious faith, and socioeconomic advantage.Specific risk factors for developing PTSD also exist. These factors primarily fall into four categories, the first of which includes lack of resilience or negative prior life experiences, which would include a history of other traumatic exposures, preexisting psychological problems, and substance abuse. The second main risk factor is the type of traumatic event. Nearly 100% of children who see a parent being killed or sexually assaulted acquire PTSD. This observation is important because it appears that in children, threat to a parent is equivalent to threat to self. Additionally, PTSD develops in 90% of sexually abused children, 77% of children who see a school shooting, and 35% who witness violence around their home.The effects of exposure to trauma through media are less clear. Many researchers have found that children resonate with media via reexposure if they were personally affected by the original trauma, but not if the trauma was more distant.A third area of risk concerns the child's reaction to the trauma. Dissociation, a psychological mechanism whereby a person attempts to protect him- or herself by separating from reality, was found to be strongly predictive of posttraumatic symptoms. Finally, the resources available to a child after a traumatic exposure can be critical. The most important of these is an attentive parent or guardian; thus, attending to parents' mental health can actually be the most effective intervention in aiding the child's recovery.Screening for and identifying PTSD can be difficult. Standardized assessments, such as the Traumatic Events Screening Inventory (see Suggested Reading) can be useful to evaluate exposure. Even after exposure is assessed, diagnosing PTSD itself can be complex, and may best be left to a child mental health provider. If a referral seems difficult, scheduling frequent appointments (monthly) to address any continued disability from the reaction to a trauma can be helpful.Treatment for PTSD is complicated and multifactorial. Regarding medications, there is some evidence that selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have some utility. In adults, these agents have been shown to reduce symptoms in all three of the symptom clusters described previously, but in children, only two small studies (24 and 26 children, respectively) support their effectiveness. Additionally, SSRIs can lead to activation (irritability, poor attention, and sleep disturbance), which can mimic the hyperarousal cluster of PTSD symptoms.In two child-specific studies, clonidine was found to decrease basal heart rate, anxiety, impulsivity, and PTSD hyperarousal. Propranolol also was found to decrease reexperiencing and hyperarousal. Opiates may be beneficial, but should be used with caution. Even controlling for subjective pain, one study found that there was a significant linear association between morphine dosage and 6-month reduction in PTSD symptoms. Neuroleptic agents, such as risperidone, have shown mixed results. Benzodiazepines have not been found to be beneficial in treating PTSD-specific symptoms, and may worsen some symptoms characterized primarily by disinhibition (aggression, acting out).In children, the strongest empiricalevidence to date supports Trauma-Focused Cognitive Behavior Therapy (TF-CBT). In fact, a study comparing TF-CBT and placebo to TF-CBT and an SSRI showed no significant differences in response rates. TF-CBT begins with the child directly discussing the traumatic event, and then proceeds to anxiety-management techniques, such as relaxation and correction of distorted trauma-related thoughts. Through this procedure, the children learn that they do not have to be afraid of their memories. CBT often is accompanied by psychological education and parental involvement. Research shows that the better parents cope with the trauma and the more they support their children, the better their children will function. Therefore, it is important for parents to seek treatment for themselves so as to develop the necessary coping skills that will help their children.Comments: After September 11th and, more recently, the devastating earthquake and tsunami in Japan, there has been more focused national and international attention on PTSD in children and adolescents. These experiences provide important examples of how communitywide interventions are essential and needed; however, Dr Kelly's In Brief reminded me of how important this topic is to patients whom I serve. I have worked most of my career with low-income patients who live in an urban area and I have been continually inspired by the resilience of these families. This In Brief reminded me of the heightened risk of these children and adolescents to PTSD because of their chance of witnessing or being involved with traumatic events, such as homicide, domestic violence, child abuse, house fires, or even dog attacks. I worry that parents may minimize some of these experiences because, unfortunately, they occur more frequently in urban communities. It is important that parents know that we as pediatric health-care providers have an interest in these experiences and to ensure that diagnosis and treatment is initiated.",

It may occur without retching or vomiting and as a result of various stimuli. Although the neural pathways that mediate nausea are not known, evidence suggests that they are the same pathways that mediate vomiting. Different neurologic diseases may produce a disturbance in central control of gut motility, resulting in gastrointestinal syndromes such as vomiting or intestinal pseudo-obstruction with or without gastric stasis. There are no accepted treatment guidelines. The pharmacologic treatment of nausea and vomiting usually involves established drugs chosen and rotated as necessary on a trial basis. Many classes of medications have been employed as antiemetics.",

      "abstract": "Chronic diarrhea is a common problem affecting up to 5% of the population at a given time. Patients vary in their definition of diarrhea, citing loose stool consistency, increased frequency, urgency of bowel movements, or incontinence as key symptoms. Physicians have used increased frequency of defecation or increased stool weight as major criteria and distinguish acute diarrhea, often due to self-limited, acute infections, from chronic diarrhea, which has a broader differential diagnosis, by duration of symptoms; 4 weeks is a frequently used cutoff.Symptom clusters and settings can be used to assess the likelihood of particular causes of diarrhea. Irritable bowel syndrome can be distinguished from some other causes of chronic diarrhea by the presence of pain that peaks before defecation, is relieved by defecation, and is associated with changes in stool form or frequency (Rome criteria).Patients with chronic diarrhea usually need some evaluation, but history and physical examination may be sufficient to direct therapy in some. For example, diet, medications, and surgery or radiation therapy can be important causes of chronic diarrhea that can be suspected on the basis of history alone. Testing is indicated when alarm features are present, when there is no obvious cause evident, or the differential diagnosis needs further delineation. Testing of blood and stool, endoscopy, imaging studies, histology, and physiological testing all have roles to play but are not all needed in every patient. Categorizing patients after limited testing may allow more directed testing and more rapid diagnosis.Empiric antidiarrheal therapy can be used to mitigate symptoms in most patients for whom a specific treatment is not available.",

A diagnosis is based on identifying the consistent symptoms with the exclusion of other organic or functional disorders having similar clinical presentations in a cost-effective manner. A physical examination should be performed on the first visit and on subsequent visits as needed. Two algorithms for the evaluation of patients seen in primary care settings and two other algorithms for patients presenting to gastroenterologists are presented. In general, if Rome II criteria are fulfilled, alarm features are not present, and screening studies from the referring physician are negative, further testing is not needed. Screening studies are recommended when certain historical information is present. In many cases, the therapeutic trial can be undertaken before further diagnostic studies are done and will depend on the symptom subtype and its severity. It needs to be emphasized that patients presenting with typical symptoms and no alarm signs are rarely found to have another diagnosis, supporting the benefit of ongoing care and symptomatic management rather than continued diagnostic evaluation. If initial treatment fails, or certain clinical features emerge requiring further evaluation, studies may be performed by gastroenterologists in specialty centers.",

Establishment of the diagnosis, information about the disorder, elimination of foods and other factors that provoke the symptoms, and a change in life-style are sufficient in most cases. Treatment is hampered by the lack of effective treatment and the psychological aspects. The therapeutic gain of drug administration is modest and the rate of response to placebo is high.

A clear definition has, however, recently been agreed.1 The Rome consensus states that symptoms should be chronic and recurring and consist of abdominal pain that is clearly related to bowel function, being either relieved by defecation or associated with a change in frequency or consistency of stool with or without disturbed defecation, which is defined as two or more of the following: altered stool frequency, altered stool form (hard, loose, or watery), altered stool passage (straining, urgency, or feeling of incomplete defecation), and passage of mucus. The above symptoms are usually associated with bloating or a sense of abdominal distension. The syndrome excludes painless constipation and diarrhoea and also chronic abdominal pain that is unrelated to bowel movement in which psychiatric features predominate.\n\nIrritable bowel symptoms are experienced by 8-22% of the population,2 but most learn to cope with their symptoms and less than one third actually consult a doctor.

      "title": "States of consciousness: new insights and further questions",
      "abstract": "In the immediate aftermath of a severe brain injury survivors are usually in coma, which is characterised as a state of unresponsiveness without any understanding or purposeful functions, although reflex responses can still be elicited. If the injury is severe enough but not fatal, the coma can persist for days or weeks, but it is nonetheless recognised to be a transient condition which evolves into other defined conscious states. Consciousness may be regained, but if not signs of a persistent vegetative state (also called unresponsive wakefulness syndrome) or a minimally conscious state develop. Both the latter are characterised by spontaneous or induced eye opening and sleep wake cycles, with additional responses such as apparent crying, laughing, or smiling. In the minimally conscious state there are also reproducible if inconsistent visual, verbal, or gestural responses to particular stimuli. In both these states, signs depend on relatively intact brain stem function, contrasting with the locked-in syndrome, a condition in which brain stem dysfunction prevents a conscious person from demonstrating their awareness.1, 2 Recognition of the two states of reduced consciousness has informed treatment and management decisions. Families and others who can see obvious signs of improvement, in that a person is no longer completely unresponsive or comatose, often expect further recovery. Standard advice is that in adults and children the potential for recovery from the persistent vegetative state, and the time to allow, depends on the cause: significant improvement can still occur up to 12 months after traumatic injury, but only up to 3 months after a non-traumatic injury, such as near-drowning. The potential for recovery from a minimally responsive state may be better, but it is not clear by how much, or if the time scales differ. One group reported that in the first 3 months there is a good chance of reasonable recovery but this falls sharply with longer durations, especially after non-traumatic injuries. In the latter groups survivors may continue to improve in terms of responsiveness but most remain severely disabled.1, 3, 4 However, problems remain. Detailed definitions of the clinical features of the two states differ.3 Distinguishing the two states is clinically difficult, although specific scales increase diagnostic precision.2 It seems logical to expect that in some patients with additional brain stem damage a state of reduced consciousness might co-exist with a degree of locked-in syndrome. In addition, from personal experience some patients do not show spontaneous eye opening or sleep-wake cycles despite other responses suggestive of a minimally conscious state. Such cases are not defined or studied in the medical literature. Finally over the last few years functional neuroimaging studies, mostly in adults, have shown that some patients have much more cortical responsiveness than clinically suspected, meaning that some thought to be in a persistent vegetative state may be at least minimally conscious.5 In one study 13 out of 41 patients classified by a standard scale as being in the vegetative state showed activity compatible with a minimally conscious state on neuroimaging between 3 weeks and 8 years after the injury. Twelve months later some clinical improvement in consciousness had occurred in most, usually to a minimally conscious state. One, assessed approximately 5 weeks after a traumatic injury, had recovered fully but the other survivors were still severely disabled.5 Ideally perhaps patients should now all be assessed by functional neuroimaging, but that may be impractical. The predictive value of more accessible modalities such as EEG and transcranial magnetic stimulation are still being explored. For all these, it would be clinically helpful if outcome studies followed a standard format to report the state and how it was assessed at fixed times after the injury, such as 3 months and 6 months, and the prognosis at 12 months or thereafter, subdivided into traumatic and non-traumatic groups. In the meantime all patients in such states should be assumed to have some awareness some of the time, which means for example that there must be adequate analgesia for painful conditions or procedures, and that further discussion is needed on the relationship between responsiveness and awareness. In children these difficulties are even more marked. There is limited data on both the accuracy of clinical diagnosis and outcome, especially in the very young age groups.1 Clinical scales have not been validated in children. Some studies of functional imaging have included children or young people but do not always report their data separately. Patient and medical groups should lobby for standardized outcome studies in children, which should be large enough to provide useful data for smaller subgroups.",

      "title": "Treating Primary Nocturnal Enuresis: The Counselor's Role",
      "abstract": "Each morning, five to seven million children wake up in a wet bed because of primary nocturnal enuresis, i.e., nighttime bedwetting. Because of the intense embarrassment and inconvenience associated with this behavior, many parents are highly motivated to seek help for the problem by consulting with counselors and other practitioners. This article provides the counselor background information and treatment approaches to effectively help such children and parents. Each morning in the United States five to seven million children wake up in a wet bed due to nighttime bedwetting (Warzak, 1993; Nemours Foundation, 1997). Untreated, this condition can lead to serious social and psychological problems. The medical community labels this behavior as primary nocturnal enuresis (PNE) or nocturnal urinary incontinence. To qualify for a diagnoses of PNE, the voiding of urine must occur at least twice a week for at least three months, or else must cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, academic (occupational), or other important areas of functioning (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). Medical authorities agree that urinary control begins around age three in the average child and that bedwetting is not considered to be a behavioral or medical problem unless it persists after the age of five (for females) or six (for males) (Warzak, 1993). Approximately 15% of children are so affected (National Enuresis Society, 1995). It should be noted that bedwetting is not considered to be a problem if it occurs only occasionally after the age three or when the child is ill. Interestingly, enuresis tends to run in families; 85% of children seen at one major enuresis clinic had a relative with enuresis and 57% had a parent or sibling with enuresis (Nemours Foundation, 1997). Two-thirds of enuretic children are male (Mikkelsen, 1988) and the problem is more common in lower socio-economic groups and among families with low educational levels (Miller, 1993). To better comprehend PNE, it is helpful to understand the normal development of bladder control. Babies normally void 12 to 16 times per day. By ages 1 to 2 they develop an awareness of a full bladder. By ages 2 to 4 the average child recognizes the sensation of voiding and develops the ability to hold-on. By ages 4 to 5 the child can initiate voiding voluntarily even before the bladder is full. Finally, the average 6 to 7 year old child can hold as necessary and void at any degree of filling (Pediatric Database, 1993). Bedwetting is then diagnosed as primary enuresis if the child is over 5 years and has never stopped bedwetting, and is referred to as secondary enuresis if the child had stopped for at least 6 months and then started again. Diurnal enuresis is the term given to bedwetting during waking hours. Primary enuresis is by far the most common type (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). Research also suggests that most bedwetting stops on its own by adolescence but may persist into adulthood unless treated. (Mikkelsen, 1988). Early treatment is recommended because it can prevent the social and psychological problems that can arise if parents elect to just let him or her outgrow it. Causes of the Problem Experts disagree as to the cause of enuresis (Miller, 1993; National Enuresis Society, 1995). Medical theories, behavioral theories and psychological theories are proposed. The medical community views primary nocturnal enuresis as a problem of maturation and/or physiology (Vogel, Young and Primack, 1996). Small bladders or especially deep sleep have been blamed but research has shown that many children with PNE have normal-sized bladders and have sleep patterns that are no different from those of non-bed-wetting children (National Enuresis Society, 1995). The counseling and psychology communities treat the problem as a deficiency in self-control skills, whether caused by physiological, behavioral or cognitive components (Ronen, Rahav and Wozner, 1995) and one which is often aggravated by social reactions toward the child (Mala, 1995). …",

      "title": "Neonatal Lethargy, Seizures, and Asphyxiation",
      "abstract": "Neonatal lethargy and seizures in newborns are problems encountered in the NICU yet can also present once neonates have been discharged. Prompt recognition of the symptoms and understanding the possible differential diagnoses are essential to guide early evaluation and therapy. A lethargic infant typically presents with feeding difficulty, a poor suck reflex, and hypotonia and may be difficult to arouse The differential diagnosis for lethargy includes hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE), infection/sepsis, asphyxiation, inborn errors of metabolism (IEMs), intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), and hyperbilirubinemia. Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy occurs when there is diminished blood supply and hypoxemia to the brain and may be due to antepartum, intrapartum, or postnatal factors, although intrapartum events seem to be the most common cause. Sepsis occurs in approximately 1 to 5 per 1,000 live births, with a higher incidence in low birthweight infants. Poor feeding and lethargy are the earliest signs, requiring prompt physical examination and laboratory evaluation, even if fever is not present. Intrapartum asphyxiation presents with lethargy soon after birth if the ischemic insult is significant. Milder hypoxic events may initially show lethargy that can progress to jitteriness and/or seizures. In contrast, lethargy secondary to an IEM will usually follow a period of normal neurologic function. Associated laboratory abnormalities such as hyperammonemia, hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia, and lactic acidosis may be present. Severe IVH can present early with signs of hypotonia and lethargy. As with asphyxiation, infant presentation can vary widely depending on the degree of bleeding. Finally, significant hyperbilirubinemia can cause an encephalopathy, with the infant presenting with lethargy and feeding difficulty.Neonatal seizures occur in 1% of all neonates. As with lethargy, prompt physical examination, laboratory evaluation, and neurologic evaluation guide treatment. The differential diagnosis for neonatal seizures is similar to that for neonatal lethargy and includes HIE, infection, intracranial hemorrhage, stroke, IEM, and familial epilepsy syndromes. Hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy is the most common cause of neonatal seizures; approximately 65% of seizures can be attributed to some degree of hypoxic injury. Seizures caused by HIE generally present in the first day after birth and can be difficult to control. The presentation can vary from mild tremors to generalized tonic-clonic seizures, depending on the degree of encephalopathy. Contrasting this, seizures caused by infection may occur later in the neonatal period. Both bacterial and viral meningitis (especially herpes simplex virus) can cause seizures and lead to significant morbidity and mortality. It is, therefore, important to review the maternal infectious history to guide prompt antibiotic and antiviral drug therapy, although lack of risk factors would not rule out infectious causes. Prompt treatment with antibiotic agents and acyclovir may be lifesaving if bacterial or herpes simplex virus meningitis is present. Intracranial hemorrhage, including subarachnoid, intraventricular, and intraparenchymal bleeding, also causes seizures in the early neonatal period. Intraventricular hemorrhage is generally more common in preterm infants. In contrast, subarachnoid hemorrhage is more common in term infants and may be secondary to birth trauma or nonaccidental trauma once the infant goes home. Focal seizures in neonates are often caused by stroke, with the distribution of the middle cerebral artery being most commonly affected. Other important causes of seizures to recognize early are homeostatic disturbances (hypoglycemia, hypocalcemia, and hyponatremia) and IEMs (aminoacidopathies and urea cycle defects). Finally, if findings from initial laboratory and neurologic evaluations are normal, there are some familial epilepsy syndromes that can present in the neonatal period. Initial evaluation for neonatal seizures should always include serum electrolytes and a complete blood cell count. In addition, if infection is suspected, blood, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid should be cultured. Electroencephalography as well as neuroimaging with ultrasound or magnetic resonance imaging should also be performed.Cases of HIE with seizures from fetal asphyxiation (umbilical cord prolapse, placental abruption, traumatic delivery, or fetal heart decelerations) can affect other organ systems. Kidney injury may be seen with only a mild insult, resulting in the inability to concentrate urine, but in more severe cases, acute tubular necrosis with complete loss of function can be seen. Measurement of serum creatinine levels, serum electrolytes, and urine output can help diagnose the initial injury and monitor kidney recovery. Myocardium may also become ischemic, which may result in impaired function and heart failure in some patients. Functional echocardiography has been used at the bedside to measure cardiac impairment secondary to hypoxic injury in real time. Regarding the pulmonary system, the injury may be primary or secondary due to cardiac failure. With coexisting heart failure, pulmonary edema may develop secondary to poor right-sided heart function. Persistent pulmonary hypertension and acute respiratory distress syndrome can also develop secondary to hypoxic injury with no discernible myocardial injury. Finally, feeding intolerance can develop secondary to underperfusion of the gastrointestinal tract. This can progress to necrotizing enterocolitis if the hypoxic injury is severe. Ischemic liver injury can also result in poor hepatic function, and if the synthesis of clotting factors is disrupted, bleeding disorders such as disseminated intravascular coagulation may develop.COMMENT: The problems of neonatal lethargy, seizures, and asphyxia can be subtle in the newborn period but present with an incredibly broad differential diagnosis. The vigilant observations of the NICU staff and the parents are critical for rapid diagnosis. Physical examination findings may be subtle, but examination of the infant's level of consciousness, breathing pattern, pupillary response, and tone may provide additional cues. Although I feel that those of us in developed countries are fortunate to have at our disposal all the laboratory and neuroimaging modalities needed to make the correct diagnosis, I marvel at practitioners in developing countries where these modalities may not be available. These providers often need to treat based on clinical suspicions, enhancing the importance of reliance on observation and physical examination skills.",

      "abstract": "Excessive Daytime Sleepiness (EDS) is a common condition with a significant impact on quality of life and general health. A mild form of sleepiness can be associated with reduced reactivity and modest distractibility symptoms, but more severe symptomatic forms are characterized by an overwhelming and uncontrollable need to sleep, causing sudden sleep attacks, amnesia and automatic behaviors. The prevalence in the general population is between 10 and 25%. Furthermore, EDS has been considered a core symptom of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), as well as being the main symptom of primary hypersomnias such as narcolepsy types 1 and 2, and idiopathic hypersomnia. Moreover, it can be considered secondary to other sleep disorders (Restless Legs Syndrome, Chronic insomnia, Periodic Limb Movements), psychiatric conditions (Depression, Bipolar Disorder) or a consequence of the intake/abuse of drugs and/or substances. An accurate medical history cannot be sufficient for the differential diagnosis, therefore instrumental recordings by means of polysomnography and the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) are mandatory for a correct diagnosis and treatment of the underlying cause of EDS.",

Estas alteraciones psicologicas deben ser estudiadas en detalle para incluirlas como objetivo terapeutico (Espina, 2003).

Por otro lado, las relaciones familiares pueden tener unas caracteristicas, especialmente la dificultad de autonomizacion de sus miembros y las alteraciones de la comunicacion, que son terreno abonado para la aparicion de trastornos alimentarios en personas susceptibles.

Concepts of health and illness are influenced by, among other things, physical, psychological, and social processes, and are dynamic and subject to change. Mental health problems arise from diverse sets of circumstances and from widely varying contexts. Often a problem can be detected through changes in a child’s emotional state (increasing anxiety or distress) or through changes in behaviour towards other people or property. Features of a problem that facilitate the assessment and understanding of what is happening include the intensity and seriousness of the problem, its frequency of occurrence, its duration over time, and its effects on the child and those close to the child. When mental health problems become severe, persistent, or associated with other problems, they may be referred to as a ‘disorder’. A mental disorder is, therefore, a mental health problem that has become severe or persistent, and seriously disrupts normal functioning.",

      "abstract": "Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, or LGS, is a rare form of childhood-onset epilepsy which usually appears between the 2nd and 6th year of life. The syndrome is characterized by frequent seizures and multiple seizure types, behaviour issues, mental retardation, regression, and a resistance to medications or therapies. The high frequency of seizures can take affect a patient's quality of life. Children are often required to wear a helmet due to the frequency of atonic seizures. Behaviour problems are a typical characteristic of LGS and can take a toll on the entire family. Individuals with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome are restricted from participating in certain activities such as some physical sports, driving, and various forms of employment. Changes in living quarters to accommodate the needs of a person with LGS are common. If an individual is wheelchair bound, an entire house or apartment may need to be remodelled for better accessibility. Shower bars and other equipment are often added in bathrooms to assist the individual. These improvements may be expensive, often leading to additional financial stress for a family. The side effects of many anti-epileptic drugs can also reduce the quality of life for a person with LGS. There is usually no single antiepileptic medication that will control seizures. Treatment for Lennox-Gastaut syndrome includes antiepileptic medications such as valproate, lamotrigine, felbamate, or topiramate. Children who improve initially may later show tolerance to a drug or have uncontrollable seizures. In the present article, we have concentrated on characteristics, incidence, prevalence, mortality, causes, diagnosis, epidemiology, evolution and pharmacological treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. This article presents a brief review of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome with an emphasis on its possible pharmacological treatment.",

Individual patients may weight differently the impact of bloating and distension on their well-being. Complaints may range from chronic highly distressing pain to simply annoying and unfashionable protrusion of the abdomen. To avoid mishaps, organic bloating, and distension should always be considered first and appropriated assessed. Functional bloating and distension often present in association with other manifestations of irritable bowel syndrome or functional dyspepsia and in that context patients tend to regard them as most troublesome. A mechanism-based management bloating and distension should be ideal but elucidating key operational mechanisms in individual patients is not always feasible. Some clues may be gathered through a detailed dietary history, by assessing bowel movement frequency and stool consistency and special imaging technique to measure abdominal shape during episodes of distension. In severe, protracted cases it may be appropriate to refer the patient to a specialized center where motility, visceral sensitivity, and abdominal muscle activity in response to intraluminal stimuli may be measured. Therapeutic resources focussed upon presumed or demonstrated pathogenetic mechanism include dietary modification, microbiome modulation, promoting gas evacuation, attenuating visceral perception, and controlling abdominal wall muscle activity via biofeedback.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Infusions of home parenteral nutrition (HPN) are often cycled at night coinciding with sleep episodes. Adult consumers of HPN are known to experience poor sleep attributed to frequent awakenings and long durations of wakefulness after falling asleep. Consequently, most consumers do not meet recommendations for sleep duration and quality or daytime napping. The primary underlying pathophysiology resulting in sleep problems is nocturia; however, other factors also exist, including disruptions caused by medical equipment (ie, pump alarms), comorbid conditions, dysglycemia, and medication use. Early guidance on sleep is imperative because of the central role of sleep in physical health and wellbeing, including mitigating complications, such as infection risk, gastrointestinal problems, pain sensitivity, and fatigue. Clinicians should routinely inquire about the sleep of their patients and address factors known to perturb sleep. Nonpharmacologic opportunities to mitigate sleep problems include education on healthy sleep practices (ie, sleep hygiene); changes in infusion schedules, volumes, rates, and equipment; and, possibly, behavioral interventions, which have yet to be examined in this population. Addressing comorbid conditions, such as mood disorders, and nutrition deficiencies may also help. Pharmacologic interventions and technological advancement in HPN delivery are also needed. Research on sleep in this population is considered a priority, yet it remains limited at this time.",

      "abstract": "Gastric function is finely modulated by a series of neurological mechanisms, so that gastric digestion is normally not perceived. Alteration of these control mechanisms may lead to different situations, which are frequently associated with symptoms. An impaired tonic contraction of the proximal stomach, that is, an impaired gastric tone, results in gastroparesis. Patients with functional dyspepsia, and also patients with achalasia, have impaired meal accommodation of the stomach. Interestingly, patients with functional dyspepsia may also have a sensory dysfunction, and both dysfunctions could play a synergistic role. However, the sensory dysfunction in dyspepsia, particularly the types of afferent fibres affected, and the mechanisms of impaired accommodation, still remain to be characterized. Evaluation of gastric function has been approached using the barostat. However, the barostat has limitations and potential technical pitfalls that require proper attention. Meal ingestion induces a variety of reflexes and the net result is a relaxation of the stomach. However, gastric reflexes can be best evaluated with the stomach empty, when the stimuli are applied at a different site. Nevertheless, altered reflex responses may be difficult to interpret. For instance, absent or decreased relaxatory responses may equally correspond to a gastroparetic stomach without tone or to a dyspeptic stomach unable to relax. In this context, it may be important to measure basal tone. Distension of the stomach by means of the barostat has been also used to test gastric sensitivity. However, recent studies have shown that perception of gastric distension relays on stimulation of tension receptors; since wall tension depends on both pressure and volume, distension with the barostat may be difficult to standardize. Hopefully, a battery of tests may become available in the near future for a complete neuromuscular evaluation of the gut.",

This case study examines the presentation, diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes of a 23-yearold male medical student diagnosed with bulimia nervosa. The patient reported a one-year history of binge eating, self-induced vomiting, and excessive exercise, driven by body dissatisfaction and low self-esteem. He also had a history of substance abuse and a prior diagnosis of bipolar disorder. A comprehensive assessment revealed psychological comorbidities, including anxiety and depressive symptoms, alongside physical complications such as electrolyte imbalances.",

A diversity of pathogenic mechanisms, operating at various levels along the brain–gut axis, are involved but symptoms are not specifically linked to pathophysiology. Significant gut motility disorders are present in a subset of IBS patients and their correct identification may have a positive impact on management. In some instances these gut motor disturbances are due to structural damage of the gut enteric nervous system or/and muscular layers. Effective treatment may be applied in some of these cases, that is inflammatory myenteritis and others. Rapidly improving diagnostic technology already exists at specialized centres for identification of intestinal neuromuscular disorders. Thus, IBS patients with longstanding severe symptoms deserve investigation of gastrointestinal motility and neural regulatory integrity.",

RLS can be idiopathic or secondary, when it occurs with iron deficiency, renal failure, medications, and neurological or rheumatological disease. Periodic limb movements are frequent but not specific to RLS. Identifying the frequency of symptoms can guide management. Treatment is with iron supplementation if deficient and with low-dose dopamine agonists or gabapentin used as first-line medications. Augmentation can occur with long-term treatment with dopamine agonists. Treatment during pregnancy differs from routine guidelines due to the risk of teratogenicity.",

Insomnia is associated with many other medical problems ranging from depression to any issue that causes physical discomfort or pain. Insomnia may be associated with a specific set of environmental conditions or a chronic and unremitting problem that is either primary or associated with another medical problem. Treatment of an associated medical problem like pain improves sleep in some but not all cases. Conversely, treatment for insomnia may improve other medical outcomes. Primary insomnia seems to be related to inability to down regulate arousal and is frequently characterized by increased metabolic rate, heart rate, or other physiological markers. Some research has shown that insomnia may therefore be related to the development of hypertension and other disorders related to physiological arousal. Relatively little work has linked nutrition with insomnia. Beyond associations between caffeine or stimulant use and poor sleep, there is limited work linking poor nutrition with poor sleep and improved nutrition with better sleep.",

Here we report a case of an illiterate tribal woman who developed pica as the sole manifestation of obsessive compulsive disorder, with onset during pregnancy. The patient had compulsions of eating uncooked rice or wheat, which resulted in toothache and abdominal discomfort. She had this habit in three pregnancies, consecutively. In the first two pregnancies it resolved spontaneously after puerperium, but persisted in the last one. Probably physical stress of limb edema during the third pregnancy was reason for the persistence. She responded to fluoxetine 40 mg / day after three months of treatment, without behavioral therapy. We conclude that pica may either be only a manifestation of obsessive compulsive disorder during pregnancy or it is an obsessive compulsive spectrum disorder.",

There are treatment algorithms, depending on the severity of obesity, and a multi-component approach, including attention to psychological issues, is recommended regardless of the level of obesity. Cognitive-behavioral therapy is beneficial in assisting with stimulus control, self-monitoring of lifestyle changes, goal-setting, and restructuring negative and self-defeating thoughts, and psychodynamic (insight-oriented) psychotherapy is useful in assisting with conflicts regarding excessive weight, body image, relationship to food and disordered patterns of eating, and dealing with the prejudice and overt discrimination obese patients may experience. Neither therapy is particularly effective alone and either and/or both may need to be continued indefinitely to avoid inevitable weight regain. Psychological intervention before and during the difficult process of dieting, as well as before and after bariatric surgery, is essential for some vulnerable patients. Since psychological factors are neither primarily etiological nor even necessarily predominant in obesity, the mental health professional plays an important, though adjunctive--\"psychotherapy-lite\" role--in treating obese patients.",

      "abstract": "A much discussed and worrisome topic today is growing ratio of eating disorders among people especially youth. Eating disorders are characteristic behavioral disorders which present persistent disturbances in eating behavior with body weight, body image and body shape continuously preoccupying an individual’s mind. These behavioral disorders affect a person’s social life along with affecting physical and psychological health. Excessive food intake, compulsive strenuous exercise, food restriction, starvation, use of laxatives, vomiting immediately after eating, binging and purging are some behaviors which depict the presence of an eating disorder. Collectively, up to 5% population, mostly adolescents and young adults suffer from eating disorders. Usually both male and female of any age and ethnicity are at equal risk of having an eating disorder but generally women suffer more as compared to men. Of eating disorders, anorexia and bulimia nervosa are common among females but can also occur in males. Psychiatric problems also occur hand in hand with eating disorders such as disproportionate mood swings, OCD, anxiety and panic attacks and different drugs abuse. Treatment of eating disorders involves treating psychological as well as physical complications along with addressing malnutrition, GERD and other gastrointestinal problems.&#x0D; Out of other eating disorders bulimia nervosa has shown increasing trends among youth. Binge eating or Bulimia nervosa is eating larger quantity of foods in shorter time span. A binge eater firstly binges on food, feels ashamed of his/her action and weight, purges secretly and also feels guilty for eating too much. While binging is done with consuming large quantity of food or filling up to the throat within short time, associated discomfort, nausea and vomiting source the purging phase. Occurrence of bulimia nervosa among young females and adolescents is high but statistics also indicate increasing ratios in young adolescent males. Although bulimia is common among youth, it can affect individuals of all ages and gender having low, normal or high weight.&#x0D; Adolescents and young adults suffering from bulimia nervosa are often those who are mentally preoccupied with weight issues, fear to gain weight, have a dreadful urge to lose weight, are super conscious and discontented with their body image, size and shape.&#x0D; An emblematic case of an individual with bulimia nervosa is often an adolescent to young adult female or male having an enthusiastic, goal oriented, perfectionist, and diligent, introverted and stubborn personality. Such individuals are also awful self-critics and tend to have low self-esteem based on body image distortion. Regardless of the physical parameters, binging on large quantities of food and then purging them out gives the person a sense of satisfaction by eating the desired type of food in hefty amounts along with a sense of control and relief by throwing up or excreting it out as an attempt to maintain weight. Generally the affected individuals do this to eat whatever they want while maintaining or losing weight upon wish. This mechanism also relieves stress, anxiety and reduces negative moods for them, keeping them calm and composed by giving the person a sense of control in at least one aspect of his/her life, which largely explains reason for the increased ratios of bulimia among youth who are constantly subjected to body shaming, peer pressure, fear of being left out, sky rocketing pressure from social media to be and look perfect and to be up to the mark with the societal beauty standards.",

      "abstract": "Meniere’s disease (also called primary Meniere’s disease or idiopathic endolymphatic hydrops) is characterized by an excess of fluid in the inner ear, which produces disturbances of balance and hearing. Symptoms of Meniere’s disease include recurring episodes of hearing loss, tinnitus, and vertigo and a feeling of pressure or fullness in the ear. Remissions occur for varying periods of time between attacks, but recurrences can progressively damage the hearing apparatus and eventually lead to permanent hearing loss. The cause of Meniere’s disease is unknown. When the condition occurs secondary to known causes such as infection, trauma, or an autoimmune disease, it is called Meniere’s syndrome or secondary EH. Patients with Meniere’s disease are typically advised to avoid caffeine, nicotine, and alcohol because these substances aggravate symptoms in some cases. Conventional treatment may also include measures to reduce fluid levels in the body (ie, a low-sodium diet [≤1.5 g/day] and diuretics), drugs that suppress the vestibular system (eg, meclizine, prochlorperazine, or diazepam), and glucocorticoids. Various surgical procedures may be recommended when medical treatment is ineffective. A number of natural remedies have shown promise in the treatment of Meniere’s disease, but most of these treatments are based on clinical observations or uncontrolled trials.",

It refers to a change in cognitive function that is severe enough to compromise an individual's daily function. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV) defines dementia as an acquired impairment of cognitive function that includes a decline in memory beyond what would be expected for age and at least one other cognitive function, such as attention, visuospatial skills or language, or a decline in executive functioning such as planning, organization, sequencing, or abstracting. The decline cannot only affect emotional abilities, but must also interfere with work or social activities. The deficits should not be accompanied by an impairment of arousal (delirium) or be accounted for by another psychiatric condition, such as depression or schizophrenia. Dementia can further be defined by a possible, probable, or definite etiologic diagnosis. A degenerative dementia implies disease progression over time.",

Non-specific and atypical presentations make the diagnosis even more difficult and a low threshold for obtaining laboratory testing is advised. Thyrotoxicosis may present with only anorexia, weight loss, and cardiac dysfunction. Hyperglycemia often remains undetected; long-term sequelae, however, may impair function and result in problems such as neuropathy, postural instability, and nephropathy--conditions often dismissed as consequences of old age. Hypercalcemia may not present with the classic findings of renal colic, GI pathology, and skeletal disease.

      "abstract": "Purpose of review In the central nervous system there are many regulatory processes controlling the lower urinary tract. This review considers the possibility that urinary dysfunction may precede diagnosis of neurological disease. Recent findings Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) occur early in multiple system atrophy, Parkinson's disease and normal pressure hydrocephalus, and may present before neurological diagnosis. Some people present with LUTS and subsequently are diagnosed with multiple sclerosis or a spinal condition. In male LUTS, the symptoms could reflect early stages of a neurological disease, which has not yet been diagnosed (‘occult neurology’). Key symptoms include erectile dysfunction, retrograde ejaculation, enuresis, loss of filling sensation or unexplained stress urinary incontinence. Directed questioning should enquire about visual symptoms, back pain, anosmia, bowel dysfunction and incontinence, or memory loss. Examination features can include resting tremor, ‘croaky’ speech, abnormal gait, orthostatic hypotension, ataxia, or altered perineal sensation. Imaging, such as MRI scan, should only be requested after expert neurological examination, to ensure the correct parts of the central nervous system are scanned with appropriate radiological protocols. Summary Urologists should consider an undiagnosed neurological condition can be present in a few cases. Any finding should be further evaluated by colleagues with relevant expertise.",

The interview not only is diagnostic, but it can also be therapeutic. Use open-ended questions, such as, “Tell me about your headaches,” “Tell me in your own words how headaches affect your life,” or “What else can you tell me about your headaches?” After presenting the patient with a list of therapeutic options described here, always ask, “What do you think about these options? Do you have any questions about them? And which ones do you want to pursue?” Establishing the correct diagnosis is not a one-time event but rather an ongoing process. Not having a biological marker or a test for primary headaches and relying on the clinical picture for diagnosis require constant vigilance and reappraisal, particularly when headaches change in character or worsen in severity or frequency. A migraine sufferer may develop other conditions, such as hypothyroidism, brain tumor, cervicogenic headaches, or magnesium deficiency, which in the beginning may only worsen the typical migraines without any additional signs and symptoms. Typical migraine, tension, or cluster headaches have been reported to occur with the majority of intracranial pathologies, such as vascular abnormalities, tumors, and infections.",

Neonatal or infantile feeding difficulties including poor suck, impaired bottle feeding, and failure to thrive are common and are often the presenting finding. Other findings can include microcephaly, variable hand and dental abnormalities, and suggestive facial features. Only ten of the 20 individuals with a TRIO pathogenic variant reported to date had sufficient information to make preliminary generalizations about clinical manifestations; it is anticipated that the phenotype of this newly described disorder will continue to evolve. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of TRIO-related ID is established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous TRIO pathogenic variant on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is symptomatic and includes routine management of developmental delays / ID, social and behavior problems, feeding difficulty, and dental abnormalities. Surveillance: Regular dietary evaluation in infancy to ensure optimal nutritional status; monitoring of developmental progress and educational needs; behavioral assessment for attention, aggression, and/or social communication difficulties; regular dental evaluations. Genetic counseling TRIO-related ID is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. The majority of affected individuals have the disorder as the result of a de novo pathogenic variant; between 20% and 40% have inherited the TRIO pathogenic variant from a similarly affected parent. Each child of an individual with TRIO-related ID has a 50% chance of inheriting the TRIO pathogenic variant. Once the TRIO pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

A neurological syndrome associated with a liver disease may be a complication of the disease, it may be induced by a factor that also contributes to the disease—for example, alcohol—or it may have no relation to the presence of the liver disease. Neurological deficits associated with liver disease may affect the CNS, the peripheral nervous system, or both. This review focuses on syndromes characterised by altered CNS function associated with structural liver diseases. Space does not permit consideration of peripheral neuropathies associated with liver disease (for example, xanthomatous peripheral neuropathy), diseases of childhood that affect the liver and CNS (for example, Reye’s syndrome), or neurological consequences of hepatic lesions characterised by specific enzyme deficiencies (for example, congenital hyperammonaemias, the porphyrias, kernicterus, galactosaemia, and Zellweger’s syndrome (cerebrohepatorenal syndrome)).\n\nThat there is a relationship between the functional status of the liver and that of the brain has been known for centuries.1 The most widely recognised aspect of this relation is that hepatocellular failure may be complicated by the behavioural syndrome of hepatic encephalopathy, in which neurotransmission in the brain is altered.2 3 Recently, it has been suggested that two other behavioural complications of liver disease, scratching due to pruritus in cholestatic patients4 5 and profound fatigue in patients with chronic cholestasis,6 7 may also be associated with altered neurotransmission in the brain.\n\n### DEFINITIONS AND CLASSIFICATION\n\nThe term hepatic encephalopathy refers to the syndrome of neuropsychiatric disturbances that may arise as a complication of acute, subacute, or chronic hepatocellular failure.

      "title": "Complementary, Holistic, and Integrative Medicine: Recurrent Abdominal Pain",
      "abstract": "Recurrent or chronic abdominal pain is a common and often perplexing condition, affecting between 15% and 35% of the pediatric population worldwide. Apley (1) first defined recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) in 1958 as at least three episodes of abdominal pain sufficient to disrupt a child's daily activities over the previous 3 months.At the time of Apley's study, only 5% of cases were found to have an organic cause. With newer diagnostic methods, up to one third of cases of RAP may be found to have organic causes. “Red flags” that might indicate specific organic diseases are: a family history of inflammatory bowel disease, fever, weight loss, night awakening, anemia, bloody stools, and localized tenderness.Most children who do not have specific organic disorders have functional RAP. The causes of functional abdominal pain still are poorly understood but are believed to be due to autonomic dysfunction or visceral hypersensitivity to stimuli such as intestinal bowel gas, an acute trigger such as a viral gastroenteritis, an increased central perception of pain, and altered bowel habits such as constipation. Perception of pain is mediated by temperamental, cultural, and psychological factors, such as anxiety or depression, and social stressors, such as learning difficulties and family stress.Functional abdominal pain may be categorized into four specific disorders, as described by the Rome III criteria for functional gastrointestinal (GI) disorders: functional dyspepsia, functional abdominal pain, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and abdominal migraine. Postprandial abdominal pain, with feelings of bloating, gas, or heartburn, is classified as dyspepsia and may be associated with gastroesophageal reflux. IBS is characterized by cramping pain with alteration in bowel movements. Episodic abdominal pain associated with headache and pallor may be an abdominal migraine.As with other illnesses, especially chronic conditions such as RAP, patients and families increasingly are turning to complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). In a group of 749 children visiting pediatric gastroenterology clinics in the Netherlands, 60% were found to have used CAM therapies. (2) Lack of effectiveness and incidence of adverse effects with standard medical therapy, along with school absenteeism, were the major reasons given for the use of such therapies. This article reviews the evidence-based CAM treatments for recurrent functional abdominal pain in children.Not surprisingly for a condition that involves the mind-body connection to such an extent, biobehavioral methods are the most effective evidence-based treatments for functional abdominal pain. It is important that families and children are educated about the importance of the mind-body connection. Parents and caregivers should be reassured that the pain is real, but it should be reframed in the context of a heightened sensitivity to normal stomach and bowel functions. Parents should not question children about their pain and should give them extra attention for nonpain behavior. It is important not to undertake unnecessary laboratory tests, procedures, and surgery. It is vital that children be taught to continue school and other normal activities, even before they are “cured.”In 2003, Weydert and associates (3) systematically reviewed 57 studies of children who had functional abdominal pain and found that psychological interventions such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and hypnosis had the greatest efficacy. Since then, others have found that although few good controlled trials have been performed, the best evidence supports behavioral treatment. (4)(5)(6)A number of randomized, controlled studies have shown the effectiveness of CBT for RAP. In these studies, children and caregivers were taught to reframe the perception of pain; establish contingency plans for management of pain; reward well behavior and ignore pain behavior; and use positive self-talk, relaxation, and imagination skills.Sanders and colleagues (7) found that 56% of children who received CBT were pain-free according to a pain diary, and 70% were pain-free 6 months after intervention, based on parental observation. By comparison, only 24% and 38%, respectively, were pain-free in the control group. Humphreys and Gevirtz (8) found that in groups of children taught biofeedback or CBT, 72% were pain-free after intervention. Robins and coworkers (9) found a decrease of 25% in abdominal pain index scores immediately and 6 and 12 months after intervention with CBT and a 30% decrease in school absences compared with controls. Duarte and associates (10) found that the median number of pain episodes per month decreased from 15 to 2 in the CBT group after the fourth monthly session and decreased from 12 to 8 in the control group in the same period of time.Hypnosis and biofeedback have been found to be very effective for the amelioration of suffering and pain in headaches and a variety of chronic pain syndromes. Hypnosis has been found to alter functional magnetic resonance imaging signal densities in the anterior cingulate gyrus and other regions of the brain, where abdominal pain is perceived and modulated. Hypnotherapy includes many of the same principles and techniques used in CBT: an explanation of the physiology of pain, an emphasis on nonpain behavior (favorite activities), relaxation, and mental imagery. However, hypnosis also includes specific suggestions for the relief of pain and continuation of normal activities.Ball and associates (11) taught relaxation mental imagery techniques to a small group of children, who experienced a 67% overall decrease in dyspepsia-like pain, as measured by the Faces scale. Others adapted the “gut-directed” hypnotherapy developed in England (12) and in North Carolina (13) for adults who had IBS. Vlieger and colleagues (14) found that developmentally appropriate gut-directed hypnotherapy, used in six 50-minute sessions with children ages 8 to 18 years, resulted in 85% remission of symptoms at 1 year compared with 25% remission in symptoms for those in a control group receiving standard medical therapy.In an intriguing recent study, van Tilburg and coworkers (15) employed home-based guided imagery recordings regularly in a group of children ages 6 to 15 years who had functional abdominal pain. A total of 63% in the treatment group responded favorably to this therapy compared with only 27% in a control group receiving medicine only. When the control group practiced home-based guided imagery, 62% were treatment responders.Biofeedback combines relaxation and mental imagery with visual or auditory feedback of somatic changes (skin temperature, skin resistance, or heart rate variability). Biofeedback may be especially useful in modulating the autonomic reactivity found in many patients experiencing functional abdominal pain, as measured by rectal manometry. Humphreys and Gevirtz (8) used simple thermal regulation techniques, in which patients are taught to alter the skin temperature in their fingertips.Interventions involving dietary manipulations, including increased fiber, lactose elimination, and supplements such as peppermint oil, have met with variable success.Although lactose intolerance is common among adults of specific ethnic groups and nationalities, it is fairly rare among children. In a 1981 study, researchers found that a lactose-free diet did not result in significant change in abdominal pain symptoms, even among children who were shown to be lactose-intolerant on breath hydrogen testing. (16)In 2001, Kline and associates (17) published their findings of a randomized, controlled study of 50 children who had RAP. The children in the treatment group received one to two enteric-coated capsules containing 187 mg of peppermint oil three times a day for 2 weeks. Results showed that 76% of treated children had a decrease in severity of symptoms compared with 19% receiving a placebo. Enteric-coated peppermint is believed to inhibit smooth muscle contractions in the gut. It also has a mild topical anesthetic effect.The salutary effects of dietary fiber on the gut are well known. The highly refined and processed foods that make up much of the American diet contribute to the increase in constipation and obesity in American children. Caffeine, fatty or spicy foods, or carbonated beverages may trigger abdominal pain. However, the therapeutic effect of increased fiber alone on amelioration of pain symptoms is questionable.Feldman and colleagues (18) reported a 50% reduction in abdominal pain among children receiving 10 g of insoluble fiber in cookie form compared with a 27% reduction in the placebo group. However, these results did not achieve statistical significance. In a similar controlled study that used larger amounts of fiber, Christensen (19) found no difference between treatment and control groups. Humphreys and Gevirtz (8) used a group that received fiber supplementation as a control in comparison with their “active intervention” groups who received behavioral treatments. Only 7% of children who received fiber alone were pain-free after treatment.Because patients who have IBS, which encompasses a large percentage of children who experience RAP, have been shown to have decreased heterogeneity of their fecal flora compared with healthy individuals, probiotics such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium have been used to alter the ecosystem of the gut therapeutically. These bacteria help to maintain a healthy intestinal mucosal barrier and prevent bacterial overgrowth. Probiotics also may decrease visceral hypersensitivity through an anti-inflammatory effect. Probiotics have been found to be useful in adults who have traveler's diarrhea and children who have acute gastroenteritis. Whorwell and associates (20) found that the probiotic Bifidobacterium infantis 35624, administered in encapsulated form, in a specific dose of 1×108 colony-forming units, significantly reduced symptoms in a large group of adult patients who had IBS.The effectiveness of probiotics in the treatment of RAP in children is mixed. Bausserman and Michail, (21) in a randomized, controlled study, found no difference in severity of pain or symptoms of bowel irregularity in a group of children receiving a Lactobacillus GG capsule compared with a placebo group, although the treatment group did have slightly reduced feelings of abdominal distention.A smaller observational study involving children who had abdominal pain caused by constipation and were given a capsule containing Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium found an increase of bowel movement frequency from 2 each week to 4.2 each week and a 50% decrease in pain. (22) However, these children also had encopresis and received enemas for 3 days as part of their treatment. Gawronska and coworkers (23) reported no overall differences in improvement of pain between placebo and Lactobacillus treatment groups in a study of 48 children, although 25% in the treatment group reported “no pain” at the end of the study, compared with 10% in the placebo control group.Part of the reason for the mixed results of the effectiveness of probiotics in the literature may be the relationship of effectiveness with the specific strain of bacteria, the precise dose, and the vehicle that delivers the probiotic. Whorwell's group found that the Bifidobacterium administered at either smaller (1×106) or larger (1×1010) doses than the therapeutic dose (1×108) were no more effective than placebo. (20)Seventy-five studies of Chinese herbs or Ayurvedic remedies for IBS in adults are reported in the literature, three of which are double-blind randomized, controlled trials, (24) but no studies report the use of these herbs in children who have RAP. Some studies show the efficacy of chamomile and fennel in infants who demonstrate symptoms of colic. These herbs, along with ginger, have long been used to help with GI disorders in many cultures.One observational study (25) compared a homeopathic remedy, spascupreel, to the antispasmodic hyoscine butyl bromide, a medication commonly used to treat functional abdominal pain. Both medications had similar effects on scores of a symptom scale.Six randomized, controlled trials have shown variable results for acupuncture as a treatment for IBS in adults, (26) but the literature contains no studies of acupuncture or any other physical treatment on children who have RAP.",

      "abstract": "Epileptic seizure is symptom of acute diseases (provoked seizure with known cause) or epilepsy (unprovoked epileptic seizure with no irritated factor). For establishment of seizure type a precise anamnesis is necessary and an EEG (video-polygraphy when awake, during sleep, after deprivation, with photostimulation, hyperventilation). Normal EEG, as well as an abnormal EEG with a positive family history of epilepsy does not confirm epileptic seizure. With clinical evaluation of the first unprovoked or repeated epileptic seizure, the exact classification of seizure, epilepsy or syndrome will be established. A non-provoked epileptic seizure will be repeated in 14-65% children in one year. In children with idiopathic/cryptogenic seizures the risk for repetition is 30-50% and in children with symptomatic cause the risk is higher than 50% in a 2 year period from the unprovoked seizure. About 46% of children followed-up over 10yrs had one or more epileptic seizures after the first unprovoked seizure. According to the literature data, even prolonged seizures rarely cause brain damage in children, except in connection with acute neurological disturbances. One of the reasons for starting antiepileptic therapy (AET) is the fear of injury or death during the next seizure. To lessen the cause of injury, it is necessary to reduce all possible risks during the daytime. Sudden death in children with epilepsy is a rarity and is connected to some kind of neurological damage. There is no study with a description of a lesser risk of injury or sudden death in children with AET introduced after the first unprovoked seizure. According to two studies of class II and four studies of class III according to EB criteria, there is no difference in terms of the chance of repeated seizure in children with AET and those without AET. The decision about introducing AET or not, in children or adolescents after the first unprovoked epileptic seizure should be based on the possibility of repeated epileptic seizures and the danger of permanent AET that can influence the child’s cognitive development, behaviour, physical and psychosocial development. The decision should be evaluated individually for each child taking into account the medical reasons together with the decisions of the patients and family. Recommendations after the first unprovoked epileptic seizure: AET is not indicated for prevention of development of epilepsy (level B); 2. Treatment with AET should be considered as a possibility of preventing the next seizure and the risk of pharmacological and psychosocial side-effects (level B). At first, in a child with the first epileptic seizure, all gathered data, clinical features and findings should be considered together with a detailed clinical evaluation, instead of immediate initiation of AET treatment.",

Getting sober from alcohol or other drugs is one of your first recovery tasks. If you can’t quit on your own, or if you relapse after short periods of abstinence, you may need to be detoxified or attend a structured substance abuse or dual-diagnosis treatment program to break the cycle of addiction. Abstinence is recommended because continued substance use can have a negative effect on your mood disorder and your motivation and can give an “incorrect” reading of the level of some antidepressant medications in your bloodstream. You also have to stabilize the acute symptoms of your mood disorder, such as mania, depression, or suicidality. Otherwise, it will be harder to stop using substances.",

Some have psychological problems or orthopaedic complaints and simple obesity is also more common in children with mild nonspecific mental retardation. Over time, children with simple obesity also develop the health consequences of severe obesity, but their lack of problems in early childhood is often remarkable. By contrast, children with ‘pathological’, secondary or endogenous obesity have obesity in association with a wide variety of other problems. Obesity is rarely their presenting problem. True secondary obesity currently accounts for only a small proportion (<5%) of cases of obesity. However developments in understanding of the genetics of obesity may change this in the future as specific diagnoses become possible for increasing numbers of previously ‘simple’ obesity cases (Farooqi & O'Rahilly, 2000).",

The size of the dining area, lighting, background music or noise, décor of the room, number of customers, variety of the items on the menu, number of plates and cutlery on the table, in addition to flowers, candles, and other decorations on the table are all potent distractors. There are so many stimuli; the patient can be overwhelmed with information overload and not able to focus on the main purpose of the event: have dinner and especially enjoy the other person's company. In this case scenario, we present a 62-year-old man diagnosed with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD). His daughter \"invited\" him to have dinner with her at a very fancy restaurant to celebrate her promotion at work. Unfortunately, whereas the evening started very well, it had a catastrophic ending. We discuss what went wrong in the patient/daughter interaction and how the catastrophic ending could have been avoided or averted.",

      "abstract": "Cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS) is a disorder noted for its unique intensity of vomiting, repeated emergency department visits and hospitalizations, and reduced quality of life. It is often misdiagnosed due to the unappreciated pattern of recurrence and lack of confirmatory testing. Because no accepted approach to management has been established, the task force was charged to develop a report on diagnosis and treatment of CVS based upon a review of the medical literature and expert opinion. The key issues addressed were the diagnostic criteria, the appropriate evaluation, the prophylactic therapy, and the therapy of acute attacks. The recommended diagnostic approach is to avoid \"shotgun\" testing and instead to use a strategy of targeted testing that varies with the presence of 4 red flags: abdominal signs (eg, bilious vomiting, tenderness), triggering events (eg, fasting, high protein meal), abnormal neurological examination (eg, altered mental status, papilledema), and progressive worsening or a changing pattern of vomiting episodes. Therapeutic recommendations include lifestyle changes, prophylactic therapy (eg, cyproheptadine in children 5 years or younger and amitriptyline for those older than 5), and acute therapy (eg, 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor agonists, termed triptans herein, as abortive therapy, and 10% dextrose and ondansetron for those requiring intravenous hydration). This document represents the official recommendations of the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition for the diagnosis and treatment of CVS in children and adolescents.",

Objetivos: Revisar as características e pontos principais da migrânea. Materiais e Métodos: revisão narrativa realizada em bases de dados digitais, livros e informações de organizações de referência mundial. Resultados: A migrânea é um tipo de cefaleia primária de alta prevalência, sendo mais comum em mulheres. Pode ser com ou sem aura – sintomas neurológicos focais que precedem a dor – ou crônica. Caracteriza-se por cefaleia pulsátil, unilateral, de intensidade de moderada a grave, associada a náusea, vomito, foto ou fonofobia e que se agrava com atividades físicas rotineiras. Deve ser diferenciada de outras cefaleias primarias e, quando na presença de sinais de alarme, também das secundárias, em especial se na terceira idade. Fatores como odores e luzes fortes, consumo de bebida alcoólica, certos alimentos, jejum prolongado, distúrbios do sono e ciclo menstrual podem desencadear uma crise. Seu tratamento pode ser farmacológico ou não, além de envolver medidas gerais; e pode ser sintomático ou profilático – mais indicado em casos mais graves ou refratários. Dentre os medicamentos utilizados durante as crises há os específicos (triptanos e derivados da ergotamina) e não específicos (analgésicos e anti-inflamatórios não esteroidais). Conclusão: Conclui-se que a migrânea deve ser reconhecida e diagnosticada correta e precocemente, objetivando uma terapêutica adequada e individualizada para que se alcance uma melhora na qualidade de vida do paciente.",

Su evolucion natural sin tratamiento puede derivar en serias repercusiones negativas en el funcionamiento academico, social y familiar de los ninos, interfiriendo de forma importante en el desarrollo. Su identificacion puede ser dificil pues, en ocasiones, son expresiones exageradas o temporalmente inadecuadas de lo que se consideran reacciones normales y adaptativas: el miedo y la ansiedad. Los TA incluyen trastornos de inicio especifico en la infancia y adolescencia (ej. el trastorno de separacion) y otros cuya expresion sindromica es semejante a los TA del adulto (ej. trastorno de panico). Las manifestaciones de los TA son polimorfas y desconcertantes en ocasiones (quejas fisicas variadas, rechazo a ir al colegio, comportamientos de apego excesivo a los padres o a los principales cuidadores, resistencia a ir a dormir, hiperactividad y oposicionismo, etc.). La consulta del pediatra es el lugar idoneo para establecer un diagnostico de presuncion y proceder a la indagacion y posterior confirmacion de aquel. El pediatra debe estar familiarizado con el diagnostico, las herramientas basicas de tratamiento y los procedimientos de derivacion a salud mental. Las principales modalidades de tratamiento en la practica clinica son la terapia cognitivo-comportamental (TCC), las intervenciones informativas para familiares y el tratamiento farmacologico. Aunque se han producido importantes avances en el desarrollo y aplicacion de tratamientos para los TA, aun existe un numero limitado de estudios que prueben la eficacia de los mismos.",

Terapi farmakologi seperti pemberian Antidepresan dan Antipsikotik atau disebut juga dengan neuroleptik untuk menurunkan frekuensi dan tingkat keparahan simtom-simtom psikotik pada penderita skizofrenia. Pengobatan dengan antipsikotik sering menimbulkan efek samping seperti mulut kering (xerostomia). Xerostomia sekunder untuk hiposalivasi juga dapat mengakibatkan karies gigi rampan, infeksi jamur mulut seperti kandidiasis, perubahan rasa, mulut berbau, atau mulut terbakar. Karies gigi merupakan penyebab utama kehilangan gigi di kalangan kelompok muda.

Pharmacological therapies such as antidepressants and antipsychotics or also called neuroleptics are intend to reduce the frequency and severity of psychotic symptoms in schizophrenics. Treatment with antipsychotics which oftenly cause some side effects such as dry mouth (xerostomia). Secondary xerostomia to hyposalivation can also result in dental caries, oral fungal infections such as candidiasis, changes in taste, bad breath or burning mouth sensation. Dental caries is a major cause of tooth loss among young group. The loss of one or several teeth can cause functional of mastication, speech and aesthetic disorders that can affect a person's quality of life. This study aims to determine the correlation of paranoid schizophrenic psychotic disorders to partial tooth loss in patients at Banda Aceh Mental Hospital. The method of acquiring the data were delivered by Non-Probability Sampling that use Purposive Sampling method obtained by 24 subjects. Data which obtained from the study were analyzed by the Chi-Square Test to see the correlation of partial tooth loss in paranoid schizophrenic patients with the effect of duration in medication treatment , gender and medication consumed. The results indicate that the gender variable did not provide significant results because of the p = 1.000. Nevertheless the variable of duration in medication treatment indicate a significant results because of the p = 0.041 and also the variable of the drugs consumed also indicate a significant results of the p = 0.027. The results of the study reveal a significant correlation between psychotic disorders of paranoid schizophrenia to partial loss of teeth in patients at the Banda Aceh Mental Hospital with a significant duration of treatment and type of drugs consumed by the patient, but there is no significant correlation to gender.\r Keywords: Paranoid Schizophrenia, Antidepressant Drugs, Antipsychotic Drugs, Xerostomia, Dental Caries, Partial Tooth Loss.",

Parasomnias Parasomnias are defined as an intrusion into sleep without a reduction in sleep length. In the preschool age group these will usually be night terrors or variants of somnambulism (sleepwalking). The main differential diagnosis of parasomnias are the nocturnal epilepsies, which may require video electroencephalogram (EEG) assessment if suspected. Night terrors The child will appear afraid, inconsolable, and often moaning or whimpering repetitively. They will usually be either unresponsive or only partially responsive to attempts to intervene or communicate. Characteristically, the child will remember nothing of the event in the morning. Night terrors usually occur in the first few hours after going to bed [a non-rapid eye movement (REM) parasomnia]",

Epidemiology PrevalenceThe prevalence of delirium varies with the population that is being studied (Fong et al., 2009).Delirium is a relatively common disorder, especially in older people with physical illness (Saxena & Lawley, 2009).Community rates of delirium are reported to vary from 0.4% to 2% (Saxena & Lawley, 2009, Fong et al., 2009).In general hospital setting prevalence of delirium has been reported to range from 11% to 33% on admission (Lindesay et al.,",

The incidence of GP is not well described; however, the number of individuals affected by symptoms of GP in the United States is estimated to be over 4 million. The etiology of GP is diverse. Approximately 25% of cases are associated with diabetes, whereas nearly 50% are classified as idiopathic; many of these latter cases likely represent a postinfectious process. Connective tissue disorders, autoimmune disorders, prior gastric surgery, ischemia, and medications make up the vast majority of the remaining cases. The pathophysiology of GP is also diverse. Abnormalities in fundic tone, antroduodenal dyscoordination, a weak antral pump, gastric dysrhythmias, and abnormal duodenal feedback all contribute to delays in gastric emptying and symptom expression. Characteristic symptoms of GP include nausea, vomiting, epigastric pain, early satiety, and weight loss. The diagnosis of GP is made using a combination of characteristic symptoms in conjunction with objective evidence of delayed gastric emptying in the absence of mechanical obstruction. Once the diagnosis is made, treatment options include dietary modification, medications to accelerate gastric emptying, antiemetic agents, gastric electrical stimulation, and surgery. In the following sections we will provide an overview of the health care impact of GP, describe the underlying pathophysiology, and review treatment options using an evidence-based approach.",

      "title": "Severe and enduring anorexia nervosa (SE-AN): in search of a new paradigm",
      "abstract": "Anorexia nervosa is one of the earliest psychiatric illnesses to be described in the medical literature with well documented accounts made in the 19th century by both Gull [1] and Lasegue [2]. They both expressed optimism about the eventual outcome of treatment. Since then, there have been many claims about successful outcomes, but all too often only reversal of the undernourished state is achieved [3]. Treatment may have minimal impact on the persistent and unrelenting ruminations pertaining to food, shape and weight which are so characteristic of those with SE-AN. Good progress has been made in treating younger patients with a shorter duration of illness using family-based approaches [4, 5] but it is those who either fail to respond, or go on to develop a severe and enduring form of the disorder (SE-AN), that have received little or no attention to date [6].\r\n\r\nThose living with a chronic illness, especially one as debilitating as SE-AN, are entitled to dream of a better tomorrow and to feel understood not only by the medical profession but by the world at large [7]. Almost every day, we are reminded about the extra-ordinary breakthroughs being made in the fight against cancer, whilst we continue to battle over the vexed issues of the imposition of involuntary treatment and the ethics of palliative care. Patients with SE-AN can no longer be ignored for they have suffered for far too long, having to contend with an abysmal quality of life devoid of any hope of an effective treatment on the horizon. This situation is in urgent need of address especially since there has only been one randomised controlled trial to date [8] that has specifically focussed upon those with the severe and enduring form of the illness. Much more needs to be done.\r\n\r\nThe time has now arrived to take the bold step in reconceptualising illness severity in anorexia nervosa especially since there is a growing recognition that the factors that may contribute towards its onset are not necessarily the same as the ones that may perpetuate it [9]. Our current classification system (DSM-5), although an improvement over its predecessors, remains limited in its clinical utility especially when identifying the onset of illness (when treatment is most likely to be effective) and giving special recognition to those when it becomes persistent [10, 11]. We have provided a cogent argument that a clinical staging model, that is so widespread in the conceptualisation and treatment of somatic illness, be adopted in anorexia nervosa. Such a model has been applied in malignancies, cardiac failure, auto-immune disease and burns where both prognosis and treatment are informed by stage [12]. Anorexia nervosa is ideally suited for the adoption of a staging model, because unlike any other psychiatric disorder, it has clearly delineated physical biomarkers of disease progression, for example bradycardia and raised liver enzymes [13] Like so many illnesses, anorexia nervosa exists on a spectrum. Just as there is no single treatment advocated for all cancers, there should not only be one treatment for all patients with anorexia nervosa. It is clear that a 14 year old adolescent with a 3 month history of anorexia nervosa would present differently to a 40 year old woman who has battled the illness for 25 years with multiple hospital admissions and has attempted cognitive behaviour therapy several times. Those with SE-AN are more likely to have high levels of disability, to be under- or unemployed, to be receiving welfare, supported by health benefit plans and become a significant burden to family, carers and health fund providers. In fact on measures such as quality of life, those with SE-AN have been found to be equal in impairment to those with severe depressive disorder as well as schizophrenia [14]. Such factors provide a compelling argument as to why a rehabilitation model of care, not too dissimilar to the ones advocated for those with schizophrenia, needs to be considered for those with a persistent eating disorder including highly specialised acute care when the need arises.\r\n\r\nIt goes without saying that such patients with SE-AN are amongst the most challenging found in mental health care [15]. They have a markedly reduced life expectancy with the highest mortality rate of any mental illness (at 20 years the mortality rate is 20 %). Because the onset of anorexia nervosa occurs at a young age, it is unfortunately not uncommon for death to occur in young adults in their thirties with a further 5-10 % every decade thereafter [16]. They suffer from a myriad of medical complications and are frequent but often reluctant visitors to general and specialist medical facilities as well as primary care services [6].\r\n\r\nMost patients with SE-AN are unlikely to fully recover. Some do but they are in the minority. It is therefore extremely important not to focus solely upon symptom reduction, but to also take into account a more holistic model of care. Such a’ recovery model’ needs to take cognisance of the person as a whole by improving not only quality of life, but overall general functioning, employment and access to suitable housing as well [17]. This requires that our more traditional approaches to treatment, developed for earlier stages of severity, undergo a metamorphosis to better fit the needs of those with a chronic and often unrelenting illness [18].\r\n\r\nIn a recent randomised controlled trial we attempted to capitalise on those principles advocated by the ‘recovery model’ by comparing two psychological treatments which were specifically adapted for those with a more chronic disorder (Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT-SE) and Specialist Supportive Clinical Management (SSCM-SE)) [8]. The hallmark and defining feature of this study, was that for the first time symptom reduction was not designated as a primary outcome measure. Weight gain was actively promoted but the primary goal was an enhanced quality of life. Both treatment arms were successful in promoting change and by the 12th month follow-up period, those patients receiving CBT-SE had lower Eating Disorders Examination global scores as well as a higher readiness to recover than those receiving SSCM-SE. However, the standout feature was the remarkably low treatment attrition rate of 13 % [19] which to our knowledge is one of the lowest ever reported. We need to rethink our treatment strategies by drawing upon the patient’s strengths and competencies rather than merely paying attention to what is ‘wrong’ with them. Undertaking treatment with a poorly motivated, chronically ill patient where loneliness, despair and an empty sense of self prevail, poses unique challenges for clinicians. As Strober [15] has cautioned, such a therapeutic endeavour requires a temperament capable of enduring hours of “…sameness, respect for solitude, the ability to face frailty and profound sickness with relative ease and the ability and willingness to explore the wounds and deprivation of a life passed by”. It is also so important to never lose the sense of hope as some (albeit few) go on to make a complete recovery.\r\n\r\nBecause of the plight of those afflicted with SE-AN [20], researchers and clinicians are now pushing the frontiers of science by exploring new and bold avenues of investigation such as deep brain stimulation [18, 21] and transcranial magnetic stimulation [18, 22]. As we delve into this brave new world, it is important not lose sight of the first rule of medicine - primum non nocere. Some people with SE-AN are so desperate to seek relief for their untold misery that they will agree to almost anything that promises relief from their suffering and despair. The ethical debate has already begun as to whether interventions such as deep brain stimulation is in fact offering hope to the hopeless or merely exploiting the vulnerable [23].\r\n\r\nThere is now more than ever before a compelling need to bring such new ideas and emerging data to the fore in a timely fashion so that replication of the most promising new data can occur and the ethical considerations widely debated. The wheel may have already started to turn with a plenary session debating this issue at the next Eating Disorder Research Society Meeting [24] in Sicily in September. Furthermore, this journal (Journal of Eating Disorders) plans to publish a special issue entirely dedicated to those patients not only with anorexia nervosa (SE-AN), but those falling within the broader spectrum of eating disorders as well. It is hoped that such a special issue focussing entirely upon those with a persistent eating disorder will not only draw attention to this long-suffering group, but also generate new avenues of exploration as well.",

      "abstract": "Bowel dysfunction is common in patients with neurological diseases. Its prevalence ranges from 30% to 60% in patients with cerebrovascular diseases and new-onset constipation occurs in 55% of patients after a stroke (Su et al., 2009; Harari et al., 2004; Robain et al., 2002; Bracci et al., 2007). In Multiple Sclerosis (MS) constipation is a frequent bowel symptom and it has been observed in up to 73% of patients (Crayton et al., 2004; Gulick et al., 2011; Wiesel et al., 2000). In Parkinson’s disease (PD) constipation is one of the most frequent non-motor features, believed to occur in over 50% of patients (Wood et al., 2010; Pfeiffer et al., 2003; Wolters et al., 2009). Disorders of the anorectal sphincters consist of incontinence or difficulty in expelling faeces. Constipation is almost always associated with slowed bowel transit. It may be due to sphincter incoordination in relation to the detrusor mechanism or to detrusor weakness causing loss of propulsive force (Swash et al., 2001). Constipation may have a significant impact on quality of life and would restrict patient’s social activities, increasing levels of anxiety and depression, so that symptoms’ management is critically important (Ng et al., 2005). This review describes the possible pathogenesis of constipation in neurological disorders, pharmacological therapies available for constipation and management approaches that may increase the likelihood of satisfactory treatment outcomes.",

Hunger does not increase reward sensitivity in AN, suggesting a deficit in translating physiological signals to motivated behavior, and explaining why individuals with AN can restrict food despite starvation. Altered reward processing may be why we see low motivation for recovery and anhedonia. Decreased brain response to reward in the cognitive circuitry in AN is associated with elevated anxiety, suggesting a brain basis for coding food as risky.",

      "title": "Abdominal Pain: Is It in the Gut Or in the Head?",
      "abstract": "It is in both. Many years have gone by since physicians used the naive dichotomy of mind versus body to differentiate \"real\" from \"imaginary\" diseases. Of course, the \"real\" ones were those that the physician could touch, see, photograph, or analyze under the microscope and the \"ones in your mind\" were those associated with disorders of function or with emotional distress. The implication was that the conditions the physician could not see were either feigned or not as important. Now we know that the gastrointestinal tract functions as a sensory and motor organ and that in each individual brain and gut have a constant exchange of information. Rare are the conditions that affect solely one domain and not the other. Even conditions, such as inflammatory bowel disease, in which the presence of bleeding and inflammatory changes provide legitimacy of real disease, are associated with high levels of mental disorders and treatment of the psychologic co-morbidities is often associated with significant improvement in quality of life (1). In other conditions, classically considered purely psychiatric, such as depression, there is a high prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms and evidence of abnormal gastrointestinal function (2). The recent observation that some functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGID) may be associated with subtle inflammatory changes (3) is blurring even further the distinction between organic diseases and functional disorders. An example of the complex interaction between mind and the gastrointestinal tract is the observation that patients who develop an intercurrent bacterial colitis are more likely to develop irritable bowel syndrome if the infection occurs at a time when there are more stressful events in the individual's life (4). Also, animal models of neonatal maternal separation (a stressful event perceived by the mind) have suggested that physical or emotional distress early in life may prime the gastrointestinal tract to develop visceral hyperalgesia (a gut dysfunction often found in FGID) (5). An observational study in Sweden has even suggested that gastric intubation in healthy newborns may be associated with late development of FGID (6). There is increasing evidence that corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) modifies gastrointestinal function and new therapeutic strategies for FGID are beginning to target its function (7). In the context of such observations, the classic diatribe between diseases primarily coming from the head or from the gut seems futile and obsolete. Unfortunately, the bias against symptoms associated with disorders of function and with psychologic distress is still present in many health care providers (8) and patients and sabotages the development of ideal treatment strategies. There continues to be a hierarchy of stigma with health care providers and patients often feeling more comfortable dealing with organic diseases that with functional disorders and even less at ease with psychiatric illnesses. The Table summarizes some of the abnormalities in gut and brain function described in children with FGID.TABLE 1: Abnormalities in gut and brain function described in children with FGIDMost of the gastrointestinal dysfunctions refer to the areas of motility and sensation. Heterogeneous abnormalities in antroduodenal motility have been described in small groups of children with severe abdominal pain. More recently doubts have arisen about the etiologic role of motility in causing symptoms in FGID. There is often little correlation between abnormal contraction patterns and symptoms. It is now believed that patients with FGID are more likely to manifest an abnormal response to a physiological stimulus, such ingestion of food or release of gastrointestinal hormones, rather than have baseline dysmotility. Perturbance of gut motor reflexes may contribute to abnormal transit and onset of symptoms. Hypersensitivity has been demonstrated in all areas of the gut in response to balloon or gas distension in adults with a variety of FGID. It has recently been shown by using PET and functional MRI technology that adults with irritable bowel syndrome show an aberrant brain activation pattern both during noxious rectal distension and during the anticipation of rectal pain (28). Psychological factors, such as degree of parental anxiety, may be important in determining how a child and his caretakers react to a symptom and in health care seeking behavior. THERAPEUTIC IMPLICATIONS In view of the interaction between gut and psychologic factors in generating symptoms in FGID it is clear that one cannot strive to cure the patient or treat the illness, until it becomes clear that there is only one health; the individual's health. Despite the fact that for years FGID were synonymous with \"motility disorders\", drugs that have targeted gut motility, such as antispasmodics or prokinetics have traditionally provided disappointing results (29). Treatment might be most effective if all aspects of the physiology of pain are addressed at once, within a bio-psycho-social model of care (30). Such an approach aims at treating peripheral and central neurologic sources of pain, as well as promoting behavioral changes for better coping with pain. Establishing a \"strong\" patient-physician alliance may be as effective as any other pharmacological or behavioral intervention to improve the patient's symptoms. Serotonin is found both in the enteric and the central nervous system and has recently emerged as a key mediator in modulating visceral sensitivity and motility. Interestingly, it has been reported that some of the medications who bind to serotonin receptors may exert their effects by modulating both gut and brain function (31). Low doses anti-depressant drugs, which inhibit serotonin uptake, facilitate endogenous endorphin release and have action the descending inhibitory pain control system, may benefit children with pain predominant FGIDs (32). Biofeedback, hypnosis, and other cognitive behavioral treatments have been beneficial in many conditions associated with chronic pain, including childhood FGIDs. \"Alternative\" treatments focusing on the \"MindBodySpirit\" connection have also great potential to impact functional disorders by modulating belief system and behaviors (33).",

The diagnosis of a chronic and recurrent mental disorder influences a person’s self-image and has a strong impact on all members of the family. In the adjustment to the diagnosis, each individual usually undergoes a process in which a variety of beliefs and emotions may arise that will have to be dealt with, in parallel to education about and acceptance of the disorder. It is common for denial to appear first, attributing what has happened to external factors. There is also a tendency for the patient to deny the chronic nature of the disorder, refusing the possibility that another episode may occur. The onset of the disease can often be accompanied by a marked sense of loss, experienced both by the person receiving the diagnosis and by his or her relatives: the loss of the healthy self together with an increase in the feeling of vulnerability, real losses as a consequence of the episodes (work is impaired, social difficulties arise, ruptures occur, family are affected, financial problems ensue, etc.) or perceived loss, sometimes erroneously, of expectations about the person him- or herself or about the future.",

Some genetic disorders are more common in children with ASD such as Fragile X syndrome, Down syndrome, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, neurofibromatosis type I, and tuberous sclerosis complex. Children with autism are also more prone to a variety of neurological disorders, including epilepsy, macrocephaly, hydrocephalus, cerebral palsy, migraine/headaches, and congenital abnormalities of the nervous system. Besides, sleep disorders are a significant problem in individuals with autism, occurring in about 80% of them. Gastrointestinal (GI) disorders are significantly more common in children with ASD; they occur in 46% to 84% of them. The most common GI problems observed in children with ASD are chronic constipation, chronic diarrhoea, gastroesophageal reflux and/or disease, nausea and/or vomiting, flatulence, chronic bloating, abdominal discomfort, ulcers, colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, food intolerance, and/or failure to thrive. Several categories of inborn-errors of metabolism have been observed in some patients with autism including mitochondrial disorders, disorders of creatine metabolism, selected amino acid disorders, disorders of folate or B12 metabolism, and selected lysosomal storage disorders. A significant proportion of children with ASD have evidence of persistent neuroinflammation, altered inflammatory responses, and immune abnormalities. Anti-brain antibodies may play an important pathoplastic mechanism in autism. Allergic disorders are significantly more common in individuals with ASD from all age groups. They influence the development and severity of symptoms. They could cause problematic behaviours in at least a significant subset of affected children. Therefore, it is important to consider the child with autism as a whole and not overlook possible symptoms as part of autism. The physician should rule out the presence of a medical condition before moving on to other interventions or therapies. Children who enjoy good health have a better chance of learning. This can apply to all children including those with autism.",

      "title": "Micturition reflex epilepsy with tonic seizures – A rare semiology with insights from magnetoencephalography",
      "abstract": "Reflex epilepsy is a condition, wherein epileptic seizures are triggered by specific stimuli such as flashing lights, music, reading etc. Stimuli may be exogenous (sensory) or endogenous (e.g.: praxis induced, solving calculations). Very rarely, the act of urination can set off seizures and this may often be confused with micturition syncope, when loss of consciousness occurs early. Our patient is a 5-year-old boy who was born to non-consanguineous parents by normal delivery. He had a smooth perinatal transit and an unremarkable first year of life. He had delay in acquisition of language milestones and began to speak bi-syllables by 2.5 years of life. Development in other domains was relatively normal. At the age of 4 years, he was noticed to have brief episodes of posturing of his upper limbs with up-rolling of eyes during sleep. These events lasted for a few seconds and occurred 5–6 times during the night. The child was treated with sodium valproate (SVA) and levetiracetam (LEV) at weight appropriate doses elsewhere. Despite good compliance, he continued to suffer from daily nocturnal brief tonic seizures. About 4 months into the illness, he developed another symptom. When the child commences to urinate, he loses consciousness and slumps to the floor. His mother reported that his limbs appeared to be tightly held in extension and his eyes looked to the right. This phenomenon occurred when child urinated in both sitting and standing position. The possibilities considered were micturition induced reflex seizures vs. micturition syncope. In view of pre-existing developmental delay and co-existing nocturnal seizures, the former differential diagnosis appeared to be more likely. His scalp EEG showed a posterior dominant rhythm of 4−5 Hz. He had frequent spikes in the right temporal (F8, T4) and frontocentral (FC) regions (F4,C4) and rare spikes in the left FC leads (F3,C3). To precisely characterize the nature of his symptoms, he underwent video-EEG telemetry. A total of 6 stereotyped events were recorded, all during micturition. Within a few seconds of starting to urinate, the child had slow neck flexion, looked to the right side with eye version to the right and had posturing of his upper limbs (right in extension and left in flexion). Its counterpart ictal EEG showed low amplitude fast activity in the midline centroparietal leads which increased in amplitude and culminated into bilateral centroparietal slowing towards the end of the attack. He regained consciousness 10 s after the cessation of ictal activity (Fig. 2). EKG recording during the ictus did not show any alteration in rhythm. It is likely that these seizures were originating from near the midline, possibly from the left hemisphere. Given that the micturition centers are also in the mesial frontal regions, this finding is not surprising. MRI done with a 3 T scanner was normal and PET-MRI did not show any areas of focal hypometabolism (Fig. 1a, ). Interictal MEG showed equivalent current dipoles clustered in the left midline posterior parietal region just above the corpus callosum (Fig. 1b). Though this is an interictal finding, it appears to be concordant with the hypothesis generated from VEEG. LEV was tapered and was prescribed lamotrigine (3 mg/kg) along with SVA (25 mg/kg). There was complete cessation of both reflex and non-reflex nocturnal seizures for the past 9 months.Fig. 2Clinical semiology and ictal EEG.Show full captiona. Clinical semiology b.

Micturition is a complex physiological process which is controlled by the spinal cord, brainstem and the cortex. The higher centers for micturition lie in the pons, periaqueductal grey, mesial frontal, anterior cingulate and insular cortex. Though the exact mechanism of reflex seizures during urination has not been elucidated, one might intuitively assume that mesial frontal activation could set off seizures in susceptible individuals. An ictal EEG and ictal PET study from Japan [[1]Okumura A. Kondo Y. Tsuji T. Ikuta T. Negoro T. Kato K. et al.Micturition induced seizures: ictal EEG and subtraction ictal SPECT findings.Epilepsy Res. 2007; 73: 119-121https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eplepsyres.2006.09.002Crossref PubMed Scopus (15) Google Scholar] observed changes in the mesial frontal region in the ictal PET scan. Clinical semiology was also suggestive of ictal onset from the left supplementary motor area. Only a handful of cases have been reported in literature, whose clinical features have been reviewed [[2]Jang H.-J. Kwon M.J. Cho K.-O. Central Regulation of Micturition and Its Association With Epilepsy.Int Neurourol J. 2018; 22: 2-8https://doi.org/10.5213/inj.1836040.020Crossref PubMed Scopus (13) Google Scholar]. Interestingly most patients have co-existing neuro-developmental issues. Seizure onset though commonly is seen in the midline in EEGs, case reports have mentioned other areas of EEG changes namely frontotemporal and occipital regions. Semiology and ictal EEG similar to our patient has been reported from another center in southern India [[3]Rathore C. Teaching Video NeuroImage: Electroclinical characteristics of micturition-induced reflex epilepsy.Neurology. 2008; 70: 20https://doi.org/10.1212/01.wnl.0000312283.88683.0dCrossref Scopus (8) Google Scholar]. In another study, urodynamic testing during the ictus identified detrusor over activity [[4]Seth J.H. McLaughlin C. Eriksson S. Fowler C.J. Walker M.C. Panicker J.N. Blackouts in the toilet: a case of micturition-induced reflex epilepsy.Pract Neurol. 2014; 14: 261-263https://doi.org/10.1136/practneurol-2013-000733Crossref PubMed Scopus (5) Google Scholar]. To the best of our knowledge, no MEG data in this type of reflex epilepsy is currently available in literature. The MEG cluster has localized to the midline left parietal region, which is posterior to the 'known micturition center' in the frontal region. The interictal MEG corresponds fairly to the region ictal EEG onset. It may only be hypothesized that this region is closely networked with the frontal micturition center. This case highlights an unusual semiology of asymmetric tonic seizures during micturition in a child with mild developmental delay and normal imaging. Overall, VEEG and MEG has suggested the role of midline structures possibly in the left parietal region. The importance of video-telemetry is emphasized, as it can help differentiate between epileptic seizures vs non-epileptic conditions. Lamotrigine and valproate combination resulted in sustained seizure freedom for 9 months. Further studies are required to elucidate treatment algorithms for these patients, but may be cumbersome as this condition is exceedingly rare.",

      "title": "Overreaching/Overtraining",
      "abstract": "Are you struggling with your exercise/conditioning routine or feeling a bit washed out, stale, and drained? Perhaps your muscles are persistently feeling heavy, stiff, a bit sore, and your exercise program has ceased to be enjoyable. If so, you may be suffering from a condition referred to as \"overreaching\" or, in more severe cases, \"overtraining syndrome.\" Overreaching is broken into functional and nonfunctional states, both of which respond to extra rest. Nonfunctional overreaching leads to a more extended period of decreased performance than functional overreaching and is accompanied by neuroendocrine and/or psychological symptoms. Overtraining is considered severe nonfunctional overreaching that results in a prolonged performance decrement (>2 months) and more severe symptoms. Effective conditioning requires a balance between intense training sessions and periods of rest/recovery. Too much overload and/or not enough recovery can result in both physiological and psychological symptoms that limit performance and may cause one to cease participation in a previously enjoyable activity. In many noncompetitive exercisers, the condition is often the result of inadequate rest/recovery because of busy work lives, family, work and health stressors, meal skipping, and poor sleep. Exercise can become addictive because of the effects of endorphins, dopamine, and other exercise-generated factors on the brain. This addiction can easily result in frequent intense training sessions that are not interspersed with adequate recovery periods. This phenomenon, especially when combined with the increasing popularity of intense multievent endurance competitions and intense group training programs, places individuals at increased risk for developing a nonfunctional state and, in more severe cases, overtraining syndrome. SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS More than 125 signs and symptoms have been identified in published literature, making a definitive diagnosis challenging. The most common symptoms include: • Persistent heavy, stiff, and sore muscles • Persistent fatigue, washed-out feeling • Decreased performance and ability to maintain the training regimen • Increased susceptibility to infections, colds, headaches • Nagging and somewhat chronic injuries • Sleep disturbances • Decreased mental concentration and restlessness • Increased irritability • Depression • Tachycardia and, in some cases, bradycardia • Loss of appetite and weight loss • Bowel movement changes • Absence of menstruation TREATMENT AND PREVENTION The primary treatment is rest and, with more severe cases, an extended break from training. Improved quality of sleep, appropriate nutrition and hydration, and addressing nonexercise stressors are essential for full recovery. In some cases, your physician may choose to rule out other potential organic causes related to a variety of illnesses and health conditions. Prevention of nonfunctional overreaching and overtraining is critical to continued enjoyment of and benefit from your exercise training program. Following are a few key tips: • Listen to your body and take extra recovery time as indicated. • Follow the 10% rule; don't increase training volume and/or intensity by more than 10% at a time. • Follow a periodization format; intersperse periods of intense/high-volume training with extended periods of rest/recovery and/or cross-training. • Recovery/rest between intense workouts is critical because this is when muscle tissue repair and growth occur; usually 24 to 72 hours depending on the intensity and volume of the session. • You shouldn't feel wiped out following a hard workout; you should feel like you could do more; if not, you are doing too much. • Proper nutrition and hydration are important; consulting a sports dietician may be helpful. • Quality sleep is essential. • Variety in your training is healthy; don't do the same thing all the time. Maintaining a training log can be helpful in identifying periods of overreaching and the need for extra recovery. Include variables such as your resting heart rate, sleep, weight (for weight loss), mood, workout intensity/duration, and how muscles and joints respond. With appropriate recovery and using a periodization plan for your long-term training, you will be able to minimize the risk of overtraining and keep your exercise and competitions fun and enjoyable.",

The symptoms of neurogenic dysphagia include drooling, difficulty initiating swallowing, nasal regurgitation, difficulty managing secretions, choke/cough episodes while feeding, and food sticking in the throat. If unrecognized and untreated, neurogenic dysphagia can lead to dehydration, malnutrition, and respiratory complications. The symptoms of neurogenic dysphagia may be relatively inapparent on account of both compensation for swallowing impairment and diminution of the laryngeal cough reflex due to a variety of factors. Patients with symptoms of oropharyngeal dysphagia should undergo videofluoroscopy of swallowing, which in the case of neurogenic dysphagia typically reveals impairment of oropharyngeal motor performance and/or laryngeal protection. The many causes of neurogenic dysphagia include stroke, head trauma, Parkinson's disease, motor neuron disease and myopathy. Evaluation of the cause of unexplained neurogenic dysphagia should include consultation by a neurologist, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, blood tests (routine studies plus muscle enzymes, thyroid screening, vitamin B12 and anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies), electromyography/nerve conduction studies, and, in certain cases, muscle biopsy or cerebrospinal fluid examination. Treatment of neurogenic dysphagia involves treatment of the underlying neurologic disorder (if possible), swallowing therapy (if oral feeding is reasonably safe to attempt) and gastrostomy (if oral feeding is unsafe or inadequate).",

      "title": "Isaac's Sign: Handkerchief Holding by Older Inpatients",
      "abstract": "“Beware a handkerchief in the hand, a handbag on the arm, food in the mouth, teeth in the jar, the hearing aid in the drawer and the artificial limb under the bed; all betoken a poor prognosis.” To the Editor: The persistent holding of a handkerchief or other object by older people is a common sight on hospital wards and in geriatric medicine outpatient clinics. Despite it apparently being a common observation, little has been documented about this phenomenon. The late Bernard Isaacs's observation that such behavior was associated with poor rehabilitative outcome1 is not proven but could, if true, point to physical or cognitive frailties as the underlying etiologies. Why many older people clutch handkerchiefs and other items is unclear. It may simply be due to physical symptoms such as rhinorrhea, drooling, or cough. There may be a psychological component—an association with insecurity, anxiety, or acute or chronic cognitive impairment. Handkerchief holding has a “mirror behavior” in childhood and could be considered regressive behavior in an older adult, analogous to a child with a security blanket or other attachment agent. One patient told us “I've always done it since I was a child. I had a rag then.” Local use of the term “andrexia nervosa” illustrates the possible association with anxiety or other emotional distress. (Andrex is a popular brand of toilet tissue in the United Kingdom. The late Independent UK newspaper witticist Miles Kington may have originally coined the term “andrexia nervosa.”) The prevalence and patient explanations of this behavior were studied. A point prevalence survey and single-question interview was conducted on all inpatient geriatric medical wards in the Leeds Teaching Hospitals National Health Services Trust (LTHT). The number of patients holding a handkerchief or other object and their age, sex, and handedness were recorded. Patients holding an object were asked one question: “May I ask why you hold a handkerchief [or tissue, etc.]?” Objective evidence of patients' physical explanations was sought from direct observation and case notes. Data are presented descriptively and analyzed using chi-square tests. Three hundred seventy-five of 420 beds in four hospital sites were occupied at the time of the survey. Thirty-three patients were excluded as unable to hold an item because of disability or severe illness; 332 patients were eligible to participate, of whom 11% were observed to be clutching a handkerchief or tissue (in 79% cases) or other object (mainly paper or toy). Patients ages ranged from 66 to 104; 84% were female. There was no difference between patients in beds or chairs; equal numbers were holding the item in their dominant and nondominant hand. More patients were found holding a tissue in acute wards (18%) than rehabilitation wards (7%). Of the explanations given by patients, 50% related to physical symptoms, objective evidence of which existed in only 28% cases (Table 1). Several patients gave a physical and a nonphysical explanation. Nonphysical explanations included “habit” or “for comfort.” Some patients were unable to explain their behavior. Most replies indicated that this behavior was long-standing; 55% using words such as “a long time,”“years,” or “always.” Fewer (2%) indicated that his behavior was recent, since being in the hospital. Some suggested that onset of handkerchief-holding behavior started in later life. We have often observed older patients holding handkerchiefs. This study, the first to explore this observation, found that it is common, with a prevalence of 11% of older inpatients, 84% of whom were female. Isaacs hypothesized that handkerchief holding may be associated with a poor rehabilitative outcome. Functional outcomes were not studied in this study, although patients gave several explanations for this behavior. Half of these were nonphysical, raising the possibility of a psychological association with handkerchief holding. In addition, objective evidence of physical explanations was found in only 28%, suggesting that some patients might be rationalizing the behavior. Tissue holding was more common on acute wards than postacute or rehabilitation wards (18% vs 7%). Greater anxiety in patients who are sicker or in a rapidly changing acute hospital environment may explain this. Use of attachment agents by children is associated with separation anxiety and is also frequently observed as a coping strategy in unfamiliar circumstances irrespective of children's maternal attachment status.2 There are obvious limitations to point prevalence studies; Isaac's sign may be intermittent and therefore underestimated, and short-term observation may inappropriately invalidate patient explanations. Further study is planned to investigate potential psychological and functional associations with handkerchief holding. Isaacs's original observation may prove a useful clinical eponymous sign.

Now a day, majority of population is suffering from digestive disorders such as anorexia, reflux , bloating, stomach pain, constipation, and acidity. These digestive disorders are mainly due to bad dietary habits like junk foods, lack of balanced diet etc and also due lack of proper sleep, stress etc. Stress shows both long term  and short term effect on gut functions like gastric secretions, gut motility, mucosal permeability etc. Our Acharas were well aware about this factor for digestive disorders, as they included Shoka, Bhaya, Krodha etc. as Nidana (cause) of digestive disorders. These various Nidana of digestive disorders causes Agnidushti which is cause of Annvaha srotodushti and Mandagni. It is very important to understand the relationship between gut and mental health to know aetio-pathogenesis of disorders, which will help to develop holistic approach for better treatment of Annavaha Srotas Disorders.",

      "abstract": "Intellectual dysfunction, usually involving short-term memory, abstract reasoning, visuomotor coordination, intellectual flexibility, and spatial reasoning, is a well-documented finding among alcohol imbibers of various drinking styles. Despite the diversity of groups examined and the attempted control of variables other than alcohol consumption, little concensus has been reached with regard to the chronology of dysfunction (as related to lifetime drinking style, duration of alcoholism, quantity consumed per session, or type of potable). In many instances, diet, age, and even sex have outweighed the relative influence of alcohol in the degree of intellectual dysfunction. Morphologically, brain changes tend to be in the anterior/basal areas and may involve the third ventricle, diencephalic areas, and other focal variations. Cerebellar changes also are not uncommon yet may reflect a subgroup of alcoholics rather than a generalised trend. Generally, many intellectual deficits partially rebound rapidly within the first two or three weeks after cessation of drinking, with perhaps modest further improvement if sobriety is sustained for several months. Because of the extreme heterogeneity of the alcoholic population and the potent effect of ancillary variables upon measures of intellectual functioning, control and matching of demographic factors is a paramount consideration. Demographic variables of primary concern include age, sex, socio-economic status, education, duration of alcoholism, quantity of alcohol consumed per session, diet, psychotropic medications, secondary psychiatric diagnoses, secondary medical diagnoses, exact duration of abstinence, and prior exposure to psychometric instruments.",

      "abstract": "Childhood Cerebral Palsy – the group of diseases concerned with motor disorders as the result of brain damage or dysfunction of certain brain centers – is usually acquired during the first years of life, at the time when the system of primary movement patterns is developing. Primary movements are genetically programmed for protection and survival, and also for the development of the conscious movement system. Developmentally their role is to support: - maturation of the nervous system (synaptogenesis, myelination, and brain plasticity) - brain function (cognitive development, emotional maturation) - sensory-motor integration. Dysfunctions of motor development and sensory-motor integration in the child with CP are a reflection of the type of neurological insult and the developmental stage of the infant/child when the neurological insult occurred. The developmental stages can be divided into prenatal (in utero); natal (during the birth process); or postnatal (after birth but during the first years of life). Each developmental stage is vulnerable to specific neurological insults. Prenatal palsy can be caused by infection, toxicity in the fetus, or compromised health in the pregnant mother. Some primary motor patterns and reflexes, such as Trunk Extension, Automatic Gait, Grasp, Swallowing and Sucking develop in utero. Prenatal brain damage will cause poor expression of these reflexes and adversely impact the next stage of development. Natal palsy is generally caused by neurological insult during birth: a consequence of premature birth, sudden deliveries, narrow pelvis of the mother, use of forceps during birth, etc. Natal trauma can negatively affect the activation of primary motor patterns and reflexes characteristic of a normal successful birth. In such cases the expression of these genetic programs will be abnormal. The primary movements and reflexes of childbirth, such as Head Righting, Perez, Tonic Labyrinthine (TLR) in extension, Bauer Crawling, Sequential Side Rotation, Spinning, and Sucking may be dysfunctional. Postnatal palsy is often caused by an infection with encephalitic symptoms. Other causes include childhood cranial injury, central nervous system injury, and poor systemic health. Infant motor patterns and reflexes will be stressed by postnatal CP, and may develop dysfunctionally or pathologically. Dynamic reflexes (e.g., Grasp, Hands Pulling, Automatic Gait, Sequential Side Rotation, Spinning); positional reflexes (e.g., Asymmetrical Tonic Neck Reflex [ATNR] Symmetrical Tonic Neck Reflex [STNR], Babkin Palmomental, Tonic Labyrinthine Reflex",

      "abstract": "Definitions Developmental dyslexia, also known as specific reading disability, is an unexpected difficulty in learning to read that occurs in the otherwise normal child. Rudel1 suggests it be defined by both exclusionary and inclusionary criteria. Her strict definition requires that five criteria be met: 1) The child must have no major neurologic abnormalities, such as overt cerebral palsy. Affected children may and often do have soft signs on neurologic examination, however. 2) The major sensory functions must be normal; the child cannot be blind or deaf. Practically speaking, children who are blind or deaf or who have cerebral palsy may be dyslexic if they have reading difficulties disproportionate to their other academic and intellectual abilities. 3) The child should have no major psychiatric problems. Problems with self-esteem are often, however, a reactive secondary issue in the child who has a learning disability. 4) Normal intelligence is required, using either a verbal or nonverbal measure. Children who have dyslexia often also have language problems. Hence, verbal intelligence scores may not reflect overall intellectual abilities accurately. 5) Finally, the dyslexic child must have been in a social and educational environment conducive to learning to read. Several studies of inner-city school children have demonstrated that enrichment programs help some nonreaders become readers, demonstrating the importance of teaching techniques.",

The polyphasic sleep is one of the typical sleep patterns found in the elderly. Comparing the sleep of the elderly with that of young adults by the method of polysomnography, the characteristics of the sleep of the elderly are in the prolongation of sleep latency, shortening of total sleep time, increase of Stage W and Stage 1, decrease of Stage 3 and 4, and also decrease of Stage REM and the advance of REM phase. Insomnia is a frequently observed symptom in the elderly. The so-called psychophysiological insomnia due to transient psychological or situational stress is common in the elderly.

In addition, other secondary symptoms may also occur, such as headache, dry mouth orblurred vision, among others. It is a problem that has a clear impact on the quality of life of those who sufferit and that can lead them to significantly reduce their social activity and negatively condition their work.Overactive bladder (OAB) is defined as urinary urgency with or without urgency urinary incontinence,nocturia, and/or frequency in the absence of UTI or other obvious pathology. Sacral neuromodulation is anewer surgical therapy for refractory OAB.Aim of Study: Is to assess the sacral neuromodulation (SN) safety and efficacy in refractory overactivebladder patients.Patients and Methods: In the period from November 2015 to May 2017. the unit of neurogenic bladderand neuromodulation in (Gazi Al_Harriry) surgical specialty hospital, medical city complex 27 patient agedfrom (17—55) year old were complaining from refractory overactive bladder. All the 27 patients underwentstage1 &amp; stage2 SNS devices implantation.Results: Patients of urgency incontinence (group1) demonstrated that the number of leak was significantlyreduced (p=0.01) after implantation of SN, (11.6_2.7) leak/day pre&amp; post SN, numbers of pads (6.9 _ 0.8)pad/day pre&amp;post SN. Patients with urgency frequency (group 2), numbers of voids/day pre &amp; post SNimplantation decreased significantly (p=0.01) (14.7 _ 6) voids /day. The voided volume increased significantly(p=0.02) from (136.4 _ 371.8) ml/void. The urgency episodes were decreased significantly (p=0.01) from(6.4 _ 2.1) episode/day.

      "abstract": "The following comments and critical remarks on Rome criteria are submitted on the basis of 50 years' experience: Rome criteria do not distinguish between non-organic disturbances which are truly digestive and those which are neuropathic or psychopathic. Yet the distinction is important both theoretically and practically. Dyspepsia is defined as pain or discomfort in the epigastrium but distinction of both terms is important for identification of subgroups and for therapy. An alternative and useful basis for definitions of functional digestive disorders is the sensations accompanying eating and defecation. Rome criteria disregard the fact that the distinction of functional from organic is not in the symptoms themselves but rather in the circumstances in which they appear or disappear. In Rome criteria some conditions are incorrectly interpreted (globus, aerophagia) and some typical syndromes are not mentioned namely fermentative enteropathy (carbohydrate dyspepsia) and pain arising in the abdominal nervous plexus - solar (celiac plexus) syndrome.",

The obvious, prolonged, dramatic events are most likelyto raise concerns of patients, relatives, and clinicians, prompting medical eval-uation (1).

The diagnostic work-up should be completed if the condition does not resolve after five years of age or in older children who experience a recurrence of nocturnal enuresis. This case report presents a 12-year-old boy with nocturnal enuresis secondary to hyperthyroidism. In many cases, nocturnal enuresis is linked to emotional disorders (like school or family problems), but increasingly the condition is rather a consequence than the reason. Currently, nocturnal polyuria, inadequate capacity of the urinary bladder and functional urinary tract disorders are considered to be the most common causes of nocturnal enuresis. It happens, however, that the background of bedwetting is more complex and the diagnosis is not so obvious.",

      "abstract": "Epilepsy is without a doubt one of the most ancient and enigmatic conditions in the history of medicine, as it was already described in remote times. From the ancestral obscure understanding of epilepsy to the present, there have been important scientific advances in the knowledge of its diagnosis and treatment. The management of a child with epilepsy requires following a protocol that includes a detailed clinical and laboratory evaluation. All chronic diseases, and also epilepsy, are felt as a double aggression: 1) Internal, related to the changes that the disease causes, and 2) external, related to the tests, medications, excessive protection, and all the rules and prohibitions that are applied. The doctor (pediatrician, pediatric neurologist or epileptologist), when initiating a relationship with the child with epilepsy, is going to propose \"a new code\", often hard to accept. He is going to intervene far away from the crisis, or soon after it happened, in an environment characterized by significant anguish for the family. There is no question that the disease is difficult for the child, as it is also for the parents, who become responsible for a different type of care, are preoccupied daily about their son taking the medication regularly, and suffer awaiting for another crisis to happen. Epilepsy, more than other conditions, creates a high level of restlessness because of the spectacular, dramatic nature of its presentation and for the ancestral myths still attributed to it. For all these reasons, the diagnosis of epilepsy is frequently accompanied by three relevant reactions in the family: anxiety, guilt and aggressiveness. The intervention of the doctor in the treatment of childhood epilepsy must be \"global\". With mystic devotion, the doctor must embrace the true Hippocratic concept of patient care.",

These individuals binge eat and purge by vomiting or other means, and often have depression, anxiety, substance abuse and extremes of impulse control. It is thought that binge eating and purging behaviors are, at least in part, a means of coping with dysphoric mood states and interpersonal stress. Bulimic symptoms are not likely to abate without development of new coping skills and behaviors. In the past 25 years, considerable progress has been made in developing specific psychotherapies and medication for the treatment of bulimia nervosa. Despite this progress, many individuals have partial responses to therapy and may remain chronically ill. This complex illness often requires a multidisciplinary team of professionals for effective management and, despite significant advances in treatment, bulimia nervosa continues to present major challenges for providers of care.",

Patients with chronic kidney disease are medically very complex, and many factors may contribute to alterations in their mental status. The presentation of uremia depends in large part on how rapidly the kidney failure develops. Acute or rapidly evolving uremia is accompanied by severe alterations in mental status such as a toxic psychosis, while slowly developing, chronic kidney failure more often presents as mild depression, dysphoria, or mild dementia. Mental status abnormalities improve with treatment, although renal dialysis may not completely restore normal mental functioning. Dialysis disequilibrium syndrome may develop in patients who are first beginning dialysis. Patients with this syndrome exhibit irritability, agitation, headache, nausea, muscle cramps, and the waxing and waning clouding of consciousness that is characteristic of delirium.",

A tic is a non-voluntary movement of the body or a vocal sound that can occur suddenly and is repeated, often rapidly. With appropriate sensitivity, the interviewer should physically demonstrate these tics when inquiring about their presence. If duration of motor tics is less than one year, the interviewer should consider a diagnosis of Other Specified Tic Disorder or Unspecified Tic Disorder and skip to Vocal Tics. Symptoms must have persisted for at least one year, although they could wax and wane in frequency, and onset of symptoms must be prior to age 18. It is very important to distinguish interference due to tics from distress due to other comorbid problems such as Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) or Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD). If only motor tics or vocal tics are present and they occurred many times a day, for less than one year, the interviewer should consider a diagnosis of Provisional Tic Disorder.",

Taste distortion or loss involves an impairment of this interaction and may be defined as dysgeusia (taste distortion), hypogeusia (reduced ability to taste), or ageusia (complete inability to taste). Medications have been reported to induce reversible and persistent taste disturbance in many patients. The mechanism by which medications alter taste is unknown, but there are many hypotheses. Patients may react to taste disturbances with decreased appetite, decreased dietary and nutrient intake, and/or increased use of salt or sugar. Management of taste disorders often includes discontinuation of the suspected offending agent. Clinicians should be proactive in identifying patients with taste alterations and in responding with appropriate interventions.",

      "abstract": "Enuresis is defined as the repeated voiding of urine into clothes or bed at least twice a week for at least 3 consecutive months in a child who is at least 5 years of age. The behavior is not due exclusively to the direct physiologic effect of a substance or a general medical condition. Diurnal enuresis defines wetting, whereas awake and nocturnal enuresis refers to voiding during sleep. Primary enuresis occurs in children who have never been consistently dry through the night, whereas secondary enuresis refers the resumption of wetting after at least 6 months of dryness. Monosymptomatic enuresis has no associated daytime symptoms, and nonmonosymptomatic enuresis, which is more common, often has at least one subtle daytime symptom. Monosymptomatic enuresis is rarely associated with significant organic underlying abnormalities. Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic disabling illness characterized by repetitive, ritualistic behaviors over which the patients have little or no control. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between OCD and nonmonosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis (NMNE).In this case-control study, we evaluated 186 children aged 6-17 years old who were visited in the pediatric clinics of Amir Kabir Hospital, Arak, Iran. The control group included 93 healthy children, and the case group included 93 age- and sex-matched children with stage 1-3 chronic kidney disease (CKD). Then, the children's behavioral status was evaluated using the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale.The difference in compulsion was significant (P = 0.021), whereas the difference in obsession was significant between the two groups (P = 0.013). The most common symptom in CKD children with compulsion was silent repetition of words.Compulsive and obsessive are more common in NMNE versus healthy children. The observed correlation between compulsive-obsessive and NMNE makes psychological counseling mandatory in children with NMNE.",

Here, the basic structure and function of the central auditory system will be highlighted as relevant to cases of permanent hearing loss where assistive devices (hearing aids) are called for. The parts of the brain used for hearing are altered in two basic ways in instances of hearing loss: (1) Damage to the ear can reduce the number and nature of input channels that the brainstem receives from the ear, causing plasticity of the central auditory system. This plasticity may partially compensate for the peripheral loss, or add new abnormalities such as distorted speech processing or tinnitus. (2) In some situations, damage to the brain can occur independently of the ear, as may occur in cases of head trauma, tumors or aging. Implications of deficits to the central auditory system for speech perception in noise, hearing aid use and future innovative circuit designs will be provided to set the stage for subsequent presentations in this special educational session.

      "abstract": "Somnipathy can be categorized in to insomnia disorders, sleep-related breathing disorders, central disorders of hyper somnolence, circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders, sleep-related movement disorders, parasomnias, and others. It can be primary or secondary, signs and symptoms of which include exorbitant daytime sleepiness, irregular breathing or increased movement during sleep and difficulty falling asleep. A few outcomes of sleep loss are obesity in adults and children, diabetes and impaired glucose tolerance, cardiovascular disease and hypertension, anxiety symptoms, depressed mood and alcohol use. Sleep disorders are frequently associated with psychiatric issues particularly depression. Studies have demonstrated that individuals with a sleeping disorder have a ten times risk of having depression in contrast to individuals who rest soundly. OSA is also linked with depression. SSRIs which increase 5-HT function increase REM sleep latency, and reduce REM sleep. Some individuals show significant improvements in depressive symptoms following a night of incomplete or complete lack of sleep, leading physicians to consider using sleep deprivation as an intervention. Antidepressants and other treatments for depression can have a beneficial effect on sleep. There is a need to evaluate for primary somnipathies, any medications being taken and underlying medical, psychiatric or substance use disorder.",

Other forms of reading retardation may be due to defects of vision, or hearing or to brain damage. Some children have specific difficulties in learning to read without any other abnormalities of intellect, though it is debatable whether dyslexia (a ‘specific syndrome wherein particular difficulty exists in learning the conventional meaning of verbal symbols, and of associating the sound with symbol in appropriate fashion’ 1 ) should be separated from other reading difficulties that may present similarly. 2 Unless treated it may persist throughout childhood and is often familial. 3 It is more common in boys than girls. It is occasionally associated with general clumsiness, but quite often with confusion in right-left differentiation in copying shapes and in spelling. Emotional disturbances, slow comprehension, lack of motivation, social deprivation and poor or interrupted schooling may also result in backwardness in reading.",

      "title": "Editorial Comment to <scp>S</scp>pina bifida occulta: Not to be overlooked in children with nocturnal enuresis",
      "abstract": "The majority of children achieve urinary control by the age of 3–4 years. However 5–10% of children have nocturnal enuresis, which is divided into monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis (MNE) and non-monosymptomatic nocturnal enuresis (NMNE). Monosymptomatic enuresis is defined as enuresis in children without any other lower urinary tract symptoms and without a history of bladder dysfunction.1 A variety of diverse conditions, such as nocturnal polyuria, sleep disturbances, reduced bladder capacity, detrusor instability and urinary tract infections, have been proposed as causative factors for primary MNE (PMNE).2 It also has been reported that nearly 15% of these patients spontaneously achieve control each year, so that by the age of 15 years only 1% of the children have enuresis.3 Enuresis is a stressful condition for both affected children and their families. Treatment improves the self-esteem of these children. Various treatment modalities, such as an alarm system, desmopressin, a tricyclic antidepressant and behavioral therapy, have been used with variable success rates in these children. Combination therapy; that is, an alarm system along with bladder training, motivational therapy and pelvic floor muscle training, is more effective than each component individually. Although pharmacotherapy, such as desmopressin and a tricyclic antidepressant, are effective while on treatment, there is a high relapse rate after stopping the treatment. In a recent published review, it was suggested that combination therapy with anticholinergic therapy increases the efficacy of other established therapies, such as imipramine, desmopressin and enuresis alarms, by reducing the relapse rates by approximately 20%. However, it was not possible to identify the characteristics of children who would benefit from combination therapy.4 Why some children do not have spontaneous improvement or respond poorly to treatment is an important research question. Spina bifida occulta (SBO), which occurs as a result of failure of fusion of the posterior arches of the lumbar spine, has been linked with a wide spectrum of urodynamic abnormalities. Several earlier studies have reported a higher incidence of SBO in these children. However, it is not very clear whether the presence of SBO has an adverse effect on the clinical outcome. In one of the studies being published in this issue of the journal, Shin et al. studied 160 children with enuresis and found SBO in 26.9% of the cases.5 In this study, the authors also reported a higher response in the group without SBO compared with the group with SBO if managed with desmopressin. The authors have rightly mentioned that it is not clear why SBO should affect the response to treatment of nocturnal enuresis. Until researchers are able to establish the mechanism of this association, there will be a question mark on this association. Also, there is a need to follow these children after stopping treatment to see if there is a lasting effect in the group with and without SBO. Identification of children with reduced functional residual bladder capacity is another factor that has been observed in several studies. Increased bladder wall thickness and higher detrusor overactivity have been reported in PMNE as compared with NMNE.6 None declared.",

      "abstract": "Nausea and vomiting are relatively common in advanced cancer and is dreaded more than pain by patients. The history, pattern of nausea and vomiting, associated symptoms, and physical examination provides clues as to etiology and may guide therapy. Continuous severe nausea unrelieved by vomiting is usually caused by medications or metabolic abnormalities, while nausea relieved by vomiting or induced by eating is usually due to gastroparesis, gastric outlet obstruction, or small bowel obstruction. Drug choices are empiric or based on etiology. Metoclopramide has the greatest evidence for efficacy followed by phenothiazines and tropisetron. Corticosteroids have not been effective in randomized trials except in the case of bowel obstruction. Treatment of nausea unresponsive to first-line medications involves rotation to medications which bind to multiple receptors (broad-spectrum antiemetics), the addition of another antiemetic to a narrow-spectrum antiemetic (a serotonin receptor antagonist such as tropisetron to a phenothiazine), rotation to a different class of antiemetic (tropisetron for a phenothiazine), or in-class drug rotation. Venting gastrostomy, octreotide, and corticosteroids will reduce nausea and vomiting associated with malignant bowel obstruction.",

      "abstract": "To the Editor: Psychogenic polydipsia is a rare disorder of which the primary clinical feature is excessive drinking of water or other fluids in the absence of a physiologic stimulus to drink.1 Excessive water intake can worsen psychiatric symptoms; can produce nausea, vomiting, delirium, ataxia, seizures, and coma; and can be fatal.1 The diagnosis of psychogenic polydipsia is one of exclusion and requires special investigation and management; the most useful test is the water deprivation test, which should be considered carefully.2 In this condition, the patient’s chronic desire to drink water diminishes the response of the kidneys to antidiuretic hormone so that they are not able to concentrate urine to maximal levels.1 Patients with psychogenic polydipsia can easily tolerate excessive water drinking unless hyponatremia (low sodium in the blood) supervenes.1 It is important for clinicians to keep in mind that psychogenic polydipsia, similar to schizophrenia, has a relapsing course and warrants vigilance and appropriate management.2 Working toward resolving the main cause of the disorder will help in improving management of the excessive fluid intake.2\r\n\r\nIt is also a challenge for psychiatrists to recognize both the potentially severe complications of this disorder in patients with comorbid mental illness and the necessity of including management of the dysregulation of fluid intake when treating these patients. We report a novel finding in the treatment of psychogenic polydipsia, which is the value of spousal involvement in the management of the disorder, perhaps above the value of pharmaceutical interventions. We have not found any literature considering the value of spousal involvement in the treatment of psychogenic polydipsia. It is our hope that this case report will promote future studies comparing the treatment of psychogenic polydipsia with spousal involvement in the treatment plan prior to initiation of medication. A psychogenic polydipsia model requires a milieu that balances maximizing the patients’ treatment with their safety.2",

However, few studies are found in the medical literature on taste disorders, including authoritative textbooks of neurology and internal medicine. 1 One reason for this may be that gustatory functions are tied to the sense of smell, the somatosensory system, and the perception of pain (eg, when spicy food is eaten), which makes it difficult to examine sensations mediated through an individual system. In addition, gustatory dysfunction is rare, eg, compared with olfactory disorders. 2,3 Therefore, the scope of this review from a neurological viewpoint is to alert physicians to the problem of taste disorders and to help in the diagnosis.",

      "title": "Sialorrhea: a review of a vexing, often unrecognized sign of oropharyngeal and esophageal disease.",
      "abstract": "Saliva is produced by the major salivary glands (parotid, submandibular, and sublingual), as well as several smaller glands. Salivary flow can be altered by multiple entities. There is much written regarding xerostomia (\"dry mouth\"), the condition related to inhibited or decreased salivary flow. This condition is widely recognized in certain systemic diseases, particularly Sjögren syndrome, diabetes mellitus, after anticholinergic, antihistamine, and decongestant medications, as well as states of enhanced sympathetic drive, such as anxiety or emotional disturbances and various other psychosocial conditions. On the other hand, sialorrhea or ptyalism, the condition of increased salivary flow, is rarely discussed in the clinical literature. Sialorrhea can occur with various neurologic disorders, infections, the secretory phase of the menstrual cycle, heavy metal poisoning, Wilson disease, Angelman syndrome, as well as a relatively unknown condition called idiopathic paroxysmal sialorrhea. Normal salivation may be altered by drugs (such as clozapine, risperidone, nitrazepam, lithium, and bethanecol) that have a cholinergic effect that induces sialorrhea. This report focuses on sialorrhea as it relates to disorders of the oropharynx and esophagus. The patient typically recognizes a problem with excessive \"foamy mucus\" but does not understand its origin. Infections and obstruction are the most common oropharyngeal causes. Increased salivary flow occurs as a typically subtle manifestation of gastroesophageal reflux disease. This occurrence is referred to as water brash. Idiopathic achalasia and megaesophagus due to the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi are regularly associated with sialorrhea. Esophageal obstruction (foreign body, cancer, or stricture formation), infection, and nasogastric intubation are the more common conditions associated with the symptomatic sequelae of sialorrhea. Sialorrhea-related respiratory and pulmonary complications are greatest in those with a diminished sensation of salivary flow and hypopharyngeal retention. Extremes of age, the chronically debilitated, or those in chronic care facilities, especially associated with cerebrovascular accidents and esophageal cancer, typically comprise this population. For the patient with an intact awareness of saliva, sialorrhea can present with significant social stigmas. Occult drooling or regular oral evacuation into a tissue or \"spit cup\" is socially incapacitating. This report provides a review of the physiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and therapeutic options for sialorrhea. Physicians and other healthcare professionals should recognize the importance of sialorrhea as a possible indicator or complication of a variety of disease states of the oropharynx and esophagus as well as its impact on the patient's physical and social quality of life.",

      "abstract": "Functional pain syndromes, including such common disorders as irritable bowel syndrome (within the field of gastroenterology); chronic pelvic pain (in gynecology); interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome (in urology); fibromyalgia (in rheumatology) and others cross multiple disciplines affecting more than 20% of the population worldwide and are more common in women. Inflammation is not a common pathophysiological pathway for a number of chronic (including functional) diseases. One of the possible explanations for this phenomenon is the neuronal reorganization associated with pain transmission (nociception), but the mechanisms of the crosstalk are unclear. Moreover, clinical presentations of functional syndromes often lack a specific pathology in the affected organ but may respond to a visceral cross-sensitization in which increased nociceptive input from an inflamed organ (i.e., uterus) sensitizes neurons that receive convergent input from an unaffected organ (i.e., colon or bladder). This mini-review focuses on the novel mechanisms for possible therapeutic interventions associated with the visceral pain primarily focusing on visceral nociceptors located within primary afferent neurons of dorsal root ganglia. Since there are observed gender differences in prevalence of functional diseases, it is proposed that estrogen may modulate nociceptor sensitization. Understanding these gender differences and neuronal reorganization associated with visceral pain will be the basis of translational efforts to modulate viscerally mediated mechanisms or functional disorders with ultimate goal to develop new therapies to treat functional disorders.",

      "title": "Unpacking agitation in practice: a call for greater precision",
      "abstract": "Agitation is a term often used by health professionals to describe patient behaviour that is regarded as problematic or disruptive. What constitutes agitation has been a topic of debate, and no unified conceptualisation prevails. Rather like terms such as ‘indigestion’, agitation may refer to completely different things when used by different clinicians. Or as famously said by Humpty Dumpty in Lewis Carroll’s Through the Looking Glass: ‘When I use a word it means just what I choose it to mean—neither more nor less’.\nA consensus statement by the International Psychogeriatric Association (IPA) [1] proposes that specific behaviours (excessive motor activity, verbal aggression, physical aggression) associated with ‘emotional distress’ have to be present for at least 2 weeks before a ‘diagnosis’ of agitation is made. This definition of agitation is limited to patients with mild-to-severe cognitive impairment, in particular dementia. Disruptive patient behaviours that are attributable to other ‘psychiatric disorders’ (e.g. psychosis), medical conditions or inadequate care do not fall under this definition of agitation. Remarkably delirium, commonly associated with agitation, is not mentioned in that statement. Perhaps this is not all that surprising as delirium is a somewhat invisible condition at bedside and organisational levels [2].",

Often these patients say they become ill when exposed to various odors, often in response to cacosmia (Ryan et al., 1988) or dysosmia (Miller, 1996). For example, they may describe everyday exposures to fragrances, diesel exhaust, new plastic car interiors, household cleaners, etc. (Table 1), as being overpowering, \"stronger than ever before,\" or \"extremely irritating\" and triggering symptoms such as headaches, fatigue, memory difficulties, mental confusion, anxiety, irritability, depression, myalgias, arrhythmias, dyspnea, and every sort of gastrointestinal problem (Table 2). This clinical presentation has come to be known as multiple chemical sensitivity (MCS) or multiple chemical intolerance. Patients presenting with this peculiar combination of subjective hyperosmia, multisystem symptoms, and multiple intolerances appear to be on the increase (AOEC, 1992; NIEHS, 1997; NRC, 1992).

The incidence is 1.5 (95% CI 1.3 to 1.7) but it ranges from 1-8 and 25 out of every 1000 born in developed and developing countries, respectively. The most frequent causes are detachment of the placenta, prolapse of the umbilical cord and uterine rupture. The diagnostic criteria include partial or total incapacity for the newborn to cry and breath at birth even when stimulated, requiring assisted ventilation in the delivery room, Apgar < 5 in 5 and 10 minutes, acidemia (pH ≤ 7 and / or bases deficit ≥ 12 mmol/l), alterations of the conscience and the reflexes of Moro, grasping and suction, muscular stretching and muscle tone. The clinical forms are mild, moderate and severe. In the mild forms, the recovery is total in three days without, or with minimal, neurodevelopmental alterations. The moderate and severe forms cause permanent neurological deficits and neurodevelopmental alterations (48%) or death (27%). The regular or amplitude integrated EEG and the magnetic and spectroscopic magnetic resonance imaging performed between 24 and 96 hours and 7 and 21 days after birth, respectively, have a high diagnostic and prognostic value. Induced hypothermia (33.5° C for 72 hours) is recommended before 6 hours old. The result is a decrease in mortality (from 35% to 27%) and morbidity (from 48% to 27%).",

A manic episode is characterised by an elevated, expansive or irritable mood which can be accompanied by a high self-esteem, decreased need of sleep, flight of ideas or racing thoughts, increased speech, distractibility, psychomotor agitation and excessive involvement in activities with painful consequences. A hypomanic episode meets the criteria for mania but is not associated with social or occupational impairment as is the case with a manic episode. A patient with a depressed episode has a depressed mood together with the possible following symptoms: sleep disturbances, psychomotor retardation or agitation, fatigue, feelings of worthlessness or guilt, impaired thinking or concentration, change of appetite or weight and suicidal thoughts.2, 3 With its manic episodes bipolar disorder differs from (unipolar) depression, which is characterized by one or more depressive episodes, but never a manic (or hypomanic) episode.",

There is usually only one correct answer for the presence or absence of these. On the other hand, there may be no single correct answer for the causes of anorexia, weight loss, or sarcopenia, and analytical reasoning is required. In this case, diagnostic reasoning involves hypotheses. Simply using nutritional supplements without performing diagnostic reasoning about these causes is like prescribing antipyretic analgesics to a patient with a headache without diagnosing the cause of the headache. To maximize function and quality of life in rehabilitation nutrition, it is necessary to suspect the common causes of anorexia, weight loss, and sarcopenia in all cases.",

      "title": "Neonatal Seizures",
      "abstract": "Definitions and Epidemiology A seizure is a sudden, paroxysmal discharge of a population of neurons that causes a transient alteration in neurologic function. This alteration may involve abnormal motor activity, sensory symptoms, a change in the level of alertness, alteration in autonomic function, or any combination of these. When a seizure occurs in the neonatal period, several special considerations arise (Table 1). A seizure in a newborn almost always reflects significant nervous system pathology, and recognizing and treating seizures properly may prevent subsequent chronic neurologic impairment. It is important not to confuse seizures with epilepsy. A seizure is a single event and may be due to a transient abnormality that will not recur (eg, hypoglycemia). Epilepsy is the condition of unprovoked recurrent seizures. Many neonatal seizures are transient events that will not progress to epilepsy. Ictal refers to clinical (based on visual observation) or electrical (based on the electroencephalogram [EEG]) activity occurring during a seizure (Table 2). Seizures occur in about 0.2% to 1.4% of all newborns. However, the incidence is much higher among certain high-risk groups. About 20% of newborns whose birthweight is less than 2500 g have seizures, with a higher incidence among sicker preterm infants. Incidence also depends on etiology; as many as 50% of newborns who have severe hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) develop neonatal seizures.",

      "abstract": "Anorexia nervosa is a disorder that is characterized by excessive preoccupation with body weight and shape, and conscious attempts to stay in low weight due to fear of weight gain. Vomiting, one of the METHODS used by anorexia nervosa patients to stay in low weight, is one of the most important causes of hypokalemia. Diuretics and diarrhea are other common causes of hypokalemia. If hypokalemia is chronic and resistant to treatment, eating disorders and other metabolic conditions should be investigated. One of the rare causes of hypokalemia, an electrolyte imbalance that can cause fatal outcomes, is Gitelman syndrome. Gitelman Syndrome is a genetically inherited disease of the distal tubules which causes hypokalemia, metabolic alkalosis, hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia and vomiting. It is a syndrome usually diagnosed during adolescence, however it sometimes remains asymptomatic throughout life. Severe symptoms such as tetanus, rhabdomyolysis, and paralysis can also be seen. A case of Gitelman syndrome which was diagnosed as anorexia nervosa due to physical appearance of the patient, low body mass index (BMI), and frequent vomiting and in which the other medical pathologies have not been adequately investigated is presented in this article. Assessments to exclude the medical conditions that may be associated with symptoms are necessary before a diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder is made.",

Most are of obscure nature while some illustrate features of syncope that deserve further scrutiny. The cases are divided into six groups: 1) Resembling cardiac syncope (30 cases); 2) vasovagal syncope (22 cases); 3) features of both cardiac and vasovagal syncope (12 cases); 4) orthostatic hypotensive (29 cases); 5) akinetic seizure? (12 cases); and 6) miscellaneous (5 cases). Some groups are subdivided according to the circumstances surrounding the spells, for example, seated eating, nocturnal, associated with bowel movement, response to anticonvulsant therapy, etc. The following conclusions seem warranted: 1) The evidence favors the existence of a type of akinetic seizure resembling cardiac syncope; 2) loss of consciousness while seated eating (prandial syncope) may comprise a syndrome; 3) syncope related to bowel movement or abdominal pain is a striking association; 4)sporadic nocturnal syncope due to temporary hyp or e activity ofbaroreceptors is not sufficiently recognized; 5) alcohol ingestion may precipitate orthostatic hy-poreactivity of baroreceptors is not sufficiently recognized; 5) alcohol ingestion may precipitate orthostatic hypotension.

      "title": "Inflammation: Depression Fans the Flames and Feasts on the Heat",
      "abstract": "Depression and inflammation fuel one another. Inflammation plays a key role in depression's pathogenesis for a subset of depressed individuals; depression also primes larger cytokine responses to stressors and pathogens that do not appear to habituate. Accordingly, treatment decisions may be informed by attention to questions of how (pathways) and for whom (predispositions) these links exist, which are the focus of this article. When combined with predisposing factors (moderators such as childhood adversity and obesity), stressors and pathogens can lead to exaggerated or prolonged inflammatory responses. The resulting sickness behaviors (e.g., pain, disturbed sleep), depressive symptoms, and negative health behaviors (e.g., poor diet, a sedentary lifestyle) may act as mediating pathways that lead to further, unrestrained inflammation and depression. Depression, childhood adversity, stressors, and diet can all influence the gut microbiome and promote intestinal permeability, another pathway to enhanced inflammatory responses. Larger, more frequent, or more prolonged inflammatory responses could have negative mental and physical health consequences. In clinical practice, inflammation provides a guide to potential targets for symptom management by signaling responsiveness to certain therapeutic strategies. For example, a theme across research with cytokine antagonists, omega-3 fatty acids, celecoxib, and exercise is that anti-inflammatory interventions have a substantially greater impact on mood in individuals with heightened inflammation. Thus, when inflammation and depression co-occur, treating them in tandem may enhance recovery and reduce the risk of recurrence. The bidirectional links between depression, inflammation, and disease suggest that effective depression treatments could have a far-reaching impact on mood, inflammation, and health.",

Insomnia can be due to primary or secondary causes. Primary insomnia refers to insomnia that appears to be unrelated to any identifiable underlying medical or psychiatric disorder.6,7 Secondary causes of insomnia include conditions where another disorder contributing to or aggravating the insomnia can be diagnosed (Table1). The diagnosis of sleep disorders is often based on obtaining a detailed sleep history, a neuropsychiatric evaluation, a physical examination looking for medical and other disorders, mental status examination and relevant investigations. A sleep diary that the patient maintains in which sleep-relevant behaviours such as bedtime and waking times, awakenings, total sleep time, napping, medications, alcohol and mood on waking often provides valuable information for the patient and physician.

Immediate postinjury objective signs of concussion are a person being dazed, confused, and disoriented, new onset of feeling nauseous or throwing up, or a period of loss of consciousness. Other postconcussion signs may include brief neurological impairments such as not being able to stand, walk, or converse sensibly immediately afterward. Acute subjective symptoms of concussion include feeling lightheaded, “seeing stars,” having blurred vision, headaches, or experiencing ringing in the ears. Postconcussion syndrome (PCS), as the name suggests, is a characteristic complex of subjective symptoms that occurs subsequent to a concussion. In the vast majority of individuals these symptoms resolve within a time period ranging from minutes to 24–72 hours. Although some symptoms may last for days, approximately 90 percent or more of individuals who sustain a concussion are asymptomatic within a couple of weeks.",

      "abstract": "The functional esophageal disorders include globus, rumination syndrome, and symptoms that typify esophageal diseases (chest pain, heartburn, and dysphagia). Factors responsible for symptom production are poorly understood. The criteria for diagnosis rest not only on compatible symptoms but also on exclusion of structural and metabolic disorders that might mimic the functional disorders. Additionally, a functional diagnosis is precluded by the presence of a pathology-based motor disorder or pathological reflux, defined by evidence of reflux esophagitis or abnormal acid exposure time during ambulatory esophageal pH monitoring. Management is largely empirical, although efficacy of psychopharmacological agents and psychological or behavioral approaches has been established for serveral of the functional esophageal disorders. As gastroesophageal reflux disease overlaps in presentation with most of these disorders and because symptoms are at least partially provoked by acid reflux events in many patients, antireflux therapy also plays an important role both in diagnosis and management. Further understanding of the fundamental mechanisms responsible for symptoms is a priority for future research efforts, as is the consideration of treatment outcome in a broader sense than reduction in esophageal symptoms alone. Likewise, the value of inclusive rather than restrictive diagnostic criteria that encompass other gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal symptoms should be examined to improve the accuracy of symptom-based criteria and reduce the dependence on objective testing.",

The symptoms must persist for at least one month. Many children with SM also have excessive shyness, poor eye contact, and fear of embarrassment. Despite the failure to speak, the child’s nonverbal communication ability is typically age appropriate and prosocial nonverbal communication such as nodding or giggling is often observed. Since SM frequently co-occurs with other communication disorders, the assessment should include a hearing and speech and language evaluation.

The symptoms of depression can be experienced differently among men, women, and children differently. Men may experience symptoms: mood, such as anger, aggressiveness, irritability, anxiousness, restlessness, behavior, such as loss of interest, no longer finding pleasure in favorite activities, feeling tired easily, thoughts of suicide, drinking excessively, using drugs, engaging in high-risk activities Women may experience symptoms: emotional well-being, such as feeling sad or empty, anxious or hopelessness, behavior, such as loss of interest in activities, withdrawing from social engagements, thoughts of suicide and irritability, cognitive abilities, such as thinking or talking more slowly. Children may experience symptoms: emotional well-being, such as feelings of incompetence (e.g. “I can’t do anything right”) or despair, crying, intense sadness, behavior, such as getting into trouble at school or refusing to go to school, avoiding friends or siblings, thoughts of death or suicide, cognitive abilities, such as difficulty concentrating, decline in school performance, changes in grades.",

      "title": "Dysphagia",
      "abstract": "Dysphagia can be defined as a disruption of normal swallowing mechanisms that can lead the patients to be unable to pass solids and/or liquids through their upper digestive tract. Dysphagia is thought to affect up to 20% of people older than 50, greater numbers of patients admitted to hospitals and even greater numbers admitted to nursing homes. Impairment of swallowing decreases quality of life and can cause significant morbidity and mortality. Dysphagia may arise from the oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx or along the length of the oesophagus. It is not to be confused with other associated symptoms such as odynophagia (pain on swallowing) or globus sensation (a sensation in the throat, commonly of a 'lump'). Dysphonia is a disorder of voice, dysarthria a disorder of speech and dysphasia one of language. It is important to understand these definitions to tease out a collection of frequently overlapping presenting symptoms, of which dysphagia is commonly the most important to the patient. Moreover, the association of dysphagia with other symptoms can aid in the identification of its cause (e.g. association of dysphagia, odynophagia and ipsilateral reflected otalgia is suspicious of an underlying pharyngeal carcinoma).",

      "title": "Psychological factors in the irritable bowel syndrome.",
      "abstract": "This paper reviews recent psychological studies of patients with the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) or 'functional abdominal pain'. Many studies have used unreliable or invalid methods of assessment and some have confused personality with treatable psychiatric illness. Reliable and valid measures have indicated that 40-50% of patients with recently diagnosed functional abdominal pain have demonstrable psychiatric illness; these patients have a worse prognosis than those who are psychologically normal. When psychiatric disorder is diagnosed in a patient with IBS there are three possibilities: (1) The patient may have developed abdominal and psychiatric symptoms simultaneously in which case treatment of the latter may relieve the bowel symptoms. (2) Psychiatric disorder may precipitate increased concern about bowel symptoms, and consequent attendance at the gastroenterology clinic, of those with chronic mild symptoms. In this case it is illness behaviour, rather than abdominal symptoms, that is caused by the anxiety/depression. (3) Those with chronic neurotic symptoms as part of their personality must be screened for organic disease if they have a fresh onset of bowel symptoms; but they are at high risk of becoming persistent clinic attenders. Further research is needed to clarify when psychological abnormalities play a role in the aetiology of IBS and when they are coincidental, but lead to illness behaviour. The role of psychological factors in the aetiology of the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is far from clear, but a review of the literature suggests that some consistent patterns are emerging in spite of methodological problems. There have been three major defects with studies that have linked IBS with neurotic symptomatology. First, the measurement of psychological factors has generally been imprecise. Second, most studies have considered IBS patients as a single group, without making allowance for differing symptom patterns. Third, conclusions have been drawn about hospital samples and extrapolated to all IBS subjects, without taking account of factors which affect consulting behaviour. Most studies have been concerned with psychological factors so these will be considered in most detail.",

In settings associated with litigation/disability evaluation, the rate of malingering may be as high as 30%, but its frequency in clinical practice is not known. We describe the main characteristics of deliberate deception (factitious disorders and malingering) and ways that neurologists might detect symptom exaggeration. The key to establishing that the extent or severity of reported symptoms does not truly represent their severity is to elicit inconsistencies in different domains, but it is not possible to determine whether the reports are intentionally inaccurate. Neurological disorders where difficulty in determining the degree of willed exaggeration is most likely include functional weakness and movement disorders, post-concussional syndrome (or mild traumatic brain injury), psychogenic non-epileptic attacks and complex regional pain syndrome type 1 (especially when there is an associated functional movement disorder). Symptom amplification or even fabrication are more likely if the patient might gain benefit of some sort, not necessarily financial. Techniques to detect deception in medicolegal settings include covert surveillance and review of social media accounts. We also briefly describe specialised psychological tests designed to elicit effort from the patient.",

It is secondary to conditions such as maternal diabetes mellitus or intra-uterine growth retardation. Other rare causes of TNHI are perinatal asphyxia and gestational diabetes. Hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (HI) is also observed in association with rare metabolic or genetic conditions. It can also occur in newborns without risk factors. TNHI is usually a transient phenomenon. However, some newborns can have prolonged HI that requires treatment with diazoxide, persists for several months and then resolves spontaneously. Neonatal hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia must be promptly and correctly diagnosed and treated in order to avoid neurological consequences. We describe a case of transient neonatal hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia in a full-term born without perinatal complications and appropriate for gestational age with an unfavourable neurological outcome.",

      "abstract": "Binge eating disorder (BED) is the most common eating disorder, with an estimated lifetime prevalence of 2.6% among U.S. adults, yet often goes unrecognized. In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), BED is defined by recurrent episodes of binge eating (eating in a discrete period of time an amount of food larger than most people would eat in a similar amount of time under similar circumstances and a sense of lack of control over eating during the episode), occurring on average at least once a week for 3 months, and associated with marked distress. It can affect both men and women, regardless if they are at normal weight, overweight, or obese, and regardless of their ethnic or racial group. Psychiatric comorbidities are very common, with 79% of adults with BED also experiencing anxiety disorders, mood disorders, impulse control disorders, or substance use disorders; almost 50% of persons with BED have ≥ 3 psychiatric comorbidities. Multiple neurobiological explanations have been proffered for BED, including dysregulation in reward center and impulse control circuitry, with potentially related disturbances in dopamine neurotransmission and endogenous μ-opioid signaling. Additionally, there is interplay between genetic influences and environmental stressors. Psychological treatments such as cognitive behavioral interventions have been recommended as first line and are supported by meta-analytic reviews. Unfortunately, routine medication treatments for anxiety and depression do not necessarily ameliorate the symptoms of BED; however, at present, there is one approved agent for the treatment of moderate to severe BED-lisdexamfetamine, a stimulant that was originally approved for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.",

      "abstract": "Narcolepsy is one among the disorders of central hypersomnolence characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness not related to disturbances in nocturnal sleep or misalignment in circadian rhythms. The cardinal symptom of this group of disorders is disabling daytime sleepiness, characterized by the repeated episodes of irresistible daytime sleepiness or lapses into sleep in monotonous situations, but also under unusual conditions such as eating. Narcolepsy is defined as type 1 and type 2 on the basis of the presence of cataplexy. The most pathognomonic feature of narcolepsy type 1 is cataplexy, which is characterized by sudden episodes of brief loss of muscle tone-sparing consciousness, usually triggered by strong emotions. Other nonspecific symptoms associated with rapid eye movement sleep dissociation include fragmentation of nocturnal sleep, hypnagogic or hypnopompic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis. The pathophysiology of narcolepsy type 1 is well established as the deficiency of hypocretin (orexin) signaling in the lateral hypothalamus. In narcolepsy type 2, on the other hand, hypocretin levels are not decreased, and it has been suggested that there is probably a partial deficiency in hypocretin signaling system to cause excessive daytime sleepiness but not severe enough to cause cataplexy. Instead of types 1 and 2, primary (idiopathic) narcolepsy, familial narcolepsy, secondary (symptomatic) narcolepsy, and narcolepsy plus (hereditary forms with additional neurological symptoms) forms were suggested to better classify the clinical entities. In this paper, the diagnosis of symptomatic or secondary narcolepsy is reviewed and classified based on the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms.",

Parental alienation may affect men's mental health: a) parental alienation negatively influences mental health of male children and adolescents who are victims of parental alienation. Alienated children/adolescents display guilt, sadness, and depressed mood; low self-esteem and lack of self-confidence; distress and frustration; lack of impulse control, substance abuse and delinquent behavior; separation anxiety, fears and phobias; hypochondria and increased tendency to develop psychosomatic illness; suicidal ideation and suicide attempt; sleep and eating disorders; educational problems; enuresis and encopresis; b) parental alienation negatively affects the mental health of adult men who were victims of parental alienation when they were children and/or adolescents. Long-term effects of parental alienation include low self-esteem, depression, drug/alcohol abuse, lack of trust, alienation from own children, divorce, problems with identity and not having a sense of belonging or roots, choosing not to have children to avoid being rejected by them, low achievement, anger and bitterness over the time lost with the alienated parent; c) parental alienation negatively influences mental health of men who are alienated from their children.

It is said to be cost effective also but efficacy of\r\nthis medicine is not yet scientifically validated Hence, I have selected Seenthilkudineer for\r\nmy clinical trial.\r\nAIMS AND OBJECTIVES:\r\nPrimary Aim and Objectives:\r\nTo evaluate the efficacy of seenthil kudineer for the management kattu mantham in Children\r\nunder the following preclinical and clinical parameters\r\n Physico – chemical Analysis, , Carminative studies, Chemical analysis of trial\r\ndrug\r\n Clinical studies\r\nSecondary objectives:\r\n To collect and review the ideas mentioned in the ancient Siddha literature\r\nabout the disease kattu mantham.\r\n To explore Definition, Etiology, Clinical features, Diagnosis, Investigations\r\nand treatment of kattu mantham as laid down from various siddha literature.\r\n To make the correlative study of the siddha and modern aspect of this diseases.\r\nCONCLUSION :\r\nThe Siddha system of medicines has certainity with safer medications to treat\r\nchildren.\r\nThe present study indicates the purity and stability of the Seenthil kudineer .The\r\nresult of In –vitro Carminative Activity of Seenthil kudineer possess promising\r\nCarminative property.\r\nThe trial drug Seenthilkudineer is treated to the children of age group,1-3 years who are\r\nall diagnosed to have kattu mantham.The ingredients of Seenthilkudineer are feasible and\r\nthese compounds may serve as potentially useful drug at lower cost since most of them had\r\ncarminative, laxative activity which controls kattu mantham.\r\nClinical results were found to be significant. Good improvement was found in 65% of\r\ncases .\r\nThe present clinical study has established that Seenthilkudineer is having good result in\r\nreducing the majority of the symptoms of kattumantham..This has in turn provided a further\r\nresearch and opportunity for new drug established in the management of Kattu Mantham.\r\nBecause of the encouraging result of above study, the drug Seenthil kudineer may be taken\r\nfor larger study in treatment of Kattumantham.",

      "title": "A geometric model of anorexia and its treatment",
      "abstract": "Anorexia is a severe psychological disorder in which a person's dieting turns into compulsive fasting. Some victims develop, after a time, a bulimic phase; their fasting is interrupted at intervals by bouts of indiscriminate gorging. One successful treatment makes use of a naturally occurring trance state, in which the anorexic's obsession with food recedes temporarily, to offer reassurance and rebuild a personality free of the obsession. The proposed model is catastrophe-theoretic. It assumes (a) that the bifurcation of eating attitudes typical of anorexia can be modeled by a cusp whose controls are hunger and eating regimen; and (b) that the normal cycle of falling asleep and waking up can be modeled by a hysteresis loop controlled by alertness. Catastrophe theory predicts two additional controls, and a larger model organized by the E6 singularity. The new controls are identified with loss of self-control and insecurity, and anorexia is correlated with high insecurity. The model makes the following predictions. First, under moderate levels of self-control and eating regimen, an anorexic has access to balanced, nonobsessive attitudes toward food at a reduced level of wakefulness. This is the trance state. Second, a healthy individual has two distinct sleep modes, dominated by cerebral and somatic elements, respectively. Third, with increasing insecurity the distinct modes fuse together, so that an anorexic's sleep patterns are abnormal. The model is geometric because the connection between behavior and controlling factors is made by graphs of certain standard form.",

The present case discusses the speech and swallowing issues in a 61-year-old male with progressive supranuclear palsy at early stage. Speech and swallowing observations revealed aspiration, hypophonia, difficulty swallowing, regurgitation episodes, and slurred speech. Followed by speech and swallowing assessment, the patient was diagnosed with Dysarthria with oropharyngeal dysphagia. T Syndopa Plus (1mg 1-1-1/day) was recommended by a neurologist. Diet modification and safe swallow strategies were suggested by speech language pathologist. Follow up after one month showed a significant improvement in swallowing skills and speech intelligibility. The patient with progressive supranuclear palsy responds well to the T Syndopa- Plus (1mg 1-1-1/day) medication, diet modification and safe swallow strategies at an early stage of the disorder. The present case stresses on the importance of swallow related intervention at early stage.",

      "abstract": "Allergic rhinitis is underestimated as a cause of suffering and diminished quality of life in children and adolescents. If nasal symptoms such as itching, sneezing, rhinorrhea, and congestion are not well controlled during the day, they may contribute to learning problems during school hours. If these symptoms are not well controlled during the night, they may contribute to nocturnal sleep loss, secondary daytime fatigue and learning impairment. Even uncomplicated seasonal allergic rhinitis may be associated with reduced ability to learn, and the likelihood of learning problems may increase in severe perennial rhinitis or in rhinitis associated with complications such as sinusitis or eustachian tube dysfunction and conductive hearing loss. Also, many of the medications used to treat allergic rhinitis may cause central nervous system adverse effects and contribute to learning impairment. For some medications, such as inhaled glucocorticoids and decongestants, the potential effect on central nervous system function and learning has not been tested. For others such as H1-receptor antagonists (antihistamines), well-designed, prospective studies have been performed. The newer relatively nonsedating medications such as terfenadine, astemizole, loratadine, cetirizine, and fexofenadine have less potential to impair central nervous system function and learning than their predecessors.",

      "abstract": "by evidence of early histological damage, functional alterations, and signs and symptoms such as anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea, which are prominent features of the radiation syndrome. In considering the nature of the altered physiology of the gastrointestinal tract produced by radiation, one is dealing with a very complicated system of the body. Digestion and absorption of food are complex and poorly understood. Symptoms related to the gastrointestinal tract are reflected via a complex system of nervous control through the autonomic sympathetics and parasympathetics. To complicate matters further, the gut has an enteric nervous system of its own which allows for autonomous movements. Gastrointestinal symptoms may stem from diseases of the gastrointestinal tract itself, from diseases of other parts of the body via complex nerve pathways, from impulses arising in the central nervous system, or from a combination of these sources. Gastrointestinal symptoms of central origin are frequent and complex in character. Such complexity is exemplified in the phenomenon of vomiting which may be produced by the sight of blood, extreme fear, or a shocking experience. Other gastrointestinal functional disturbances of a more chronic nature may result from psychic imbalance. It is often difficult to distinguish between organic disease of the gastrointestinal tract and functional disturbances which are purely psychic in origin. In addition, disturbances of central origin are said to be produced by toxins affecting the vomiting and other higher centers. Many acute infectious diseases are ushered in with gastrointestinal symptoms which are believed to be due to central toxic as well as local effects. Disease or trauma of other viscera or parts of the body may produce gastrointestinal symptoms by reflex mechanisms through the central nervous system. Very little is yet known about the part the afferent and efferent nervous elements play in the symptomatology related to radiation injury of the gastrointestinal tract.",

      "abstract": "Multiple Sklerose (MS) ist die häufigste degenerative Erkrankung des zentralen Nervensystems bei jungen Erwachsenen in den Industrienationen, einhergehend mit chronischen Entzündungen in Gehirn und Rückenmark und sukzessiver Demyelinisierung bzw. Zerstörung von Axonen. MS wird den Autoimmunerkrankungen zugeordnet, mit chronischem und meist schubförmigem Verlauf. Im Schub treten Ausfallerscheinungen wie Lähmungen, Erblinden oder kognitive Beeinträchtigungen auf. Die Ursachen sind ungeklärt. Zur pharmakologischen Therapie stehen u. a. Glukokortikoide und immunmodulierende Therapeutika zur Verfügung. Viele der körperlichen und psychosozialen Beeinträchtigungen wie Kau- und Schluckstörungen wirken sich direkt auf den Ernährungsstatus aus. Zusätzliche Beschwerden entstehen infolge unerwünschter Arzneimittelwirkungen, z. B. durch Glukokortikoide. Lähmung und psychosoziale Belastung tragen zur Adipositasentstehung bei. Im Resultat ist je nach Verlauf, das Risiko für Fehl-, Über- und/oder Unterernährung gegeben. Befragungen zeigten, dass ein hoher Anteil Betroffener unkontrolliert Nahrungssupplemente einnimmt bzw. einseitige Wunderdiäten durchführt, wodurch sich diese Risiken umso gravierender darstellen. Alle angeführten Punkte illustrieren den dringenden (Be-)Handlungsbedarf seitens Ernährungsmedizin und Ernährungsberatung, deren Vorteile unbestritten sind. Eine professionelle Anleitung kann der risikoreichen Eigenbehandlung entgegensteuern, bzw. zu Eigenständigkeit und Lebensqualität von MS-Kranken beitragen. Aktuell nehmen diese noch selten ernährungstherapeutische Beratung in Anspruch. Die ernährungsmedizinische Forschung konzentriert sich auf die Einflussnahme auf das Krankheitsgeschehen. Hinweise gibt es z. B. für die Zufuhr von n-3- und n-6-Fettsäuren oder Vitamin D. Die Literatur hierzu ist umfangreich, erlaubt aber keine generalisierbare Aussage über wirksame Ernährungsstrategien oder Supplementation explizit für MS-Kranke. Unabhängig von dieser Zielsetzung, besteht aber auch Bedarf, MS-Kranke bezüglich ihrer reellen Ernährungsrisiken adäquat zu beraten bzw. zu behandeln. Ein in der Zielgruppe noch zu evaluierendes Konzept erarbeiteten Adam et al. mit der „Anti Entzündlichen Diät“ (AED). Originär für rheumatische Erkrankungen entwickelt, lag aufgrund pathologischer Parallelen die Adaptation für MS nahe. Das Wirkprinzip beruht u. a. auf Modifikation der alimentären Fettzufuhr, basierend auf den generellen Empfehlungen für eine ausgewogene Ernährung und einer flexiblen, nichtrestriktiven Umsetzung.",

Compulsive behaviour is concerned most with hygiene, orderliness, checking, grooming, and hoarding, whereas obsessive thoughts (rumination) focus on harm avoidance and cultural taboos. Compulsive behaviours resemble stereotypic movements seen in animals or cultural rituals. Cognitively, anticipating potential future risk scenarios may help in minimising threat, suggesting that obsessivecompulsive disorder may be a by-product of foresight. Obsessive-compulsive disorder is often linked to life events that require heightened vigilance for threat, including sexual maturation (puberty), pregnancy, and childbirth. While most individuals with obsessive-compulsive disorder follow a ‘slow’ life-history strategy, cases with increased impulsivity and reduced inhibitory control seem to pursue a ‘fast’ life-history strategy.",

      "abstract": "Restless legs syndrome (RLS), also known as Ekbom's syndrome, is a fairly common complaint which is not widely recognised by medical professionals, although it seems to affect 1-10% of the population. Despite recent attempts to better characterize RLS, this neurologic disorder remains poorly understood. Idiopathic RLS frequently follows an autosomal dominant inheritance with a variable clinical expressivity of symptoms. Secondary RLS is usually associated with neuropathy of chronic disorders (uremia, cryoglobulinemia, diabetes mellitus, infections, etc). RLS gives the sufferer an unpleasant sensation in the legs at rest, causing an irresistible desire to move which alleviates the discomfort. Other features that characterize RLS include sleep disturbance, involuntary movements in sleep or wakefulness, a normal neurologic examination, a chronic clinical course (waxing and waning over the time), and, in some cases, a positive family history. Periodic limb movements during sleep, which also may occur as an isolated finding, may or may not cause frequent arousals or awakenings. Clinical diagnosis of idiopathic or symptomatic forms of RLS can be supported with polysomnography. Full understanding of the features of RLS will provide the clinician with the strongest tool for recognizing the disorder. Many different treatments have been tried for RLS. Since the cause is unclear, therapy of RLS and PLMS remains symptomatic except for some secondary forms. Treatment of first choice consists of dopaminergic drugs or dopamine agonist, opioids and benzodiazepines.",

There are many reasons why the symptom \"anorexia\" has been neglected. A child's appetite is normally good, and when it is depleted it becomes a secondarily subjective symptom through the objective observation of the mother. There are few dependable objective signs that will infallibly confirm or deny the subjective complaint of loss of appetite in children. As far as this report is concerned, anorexia is considered unimportant unless it is severe and chronic enough to produce objective signs of malnutrition.

The overriding complex neurological control is also important. A disorder of any of these may lead to faecal incontinence. This can affect over 10% of adults and at least 1–2% of patents will report these as major symptoms. In itself, faecal incontinence is not a disease but a symptom and it is necessary to take a full history and examine a patient to identify any underlying diseases or pathology that may need treatment before focusing on managing incontinence. The aim of any treatment for faecal incontinence is to improve the patient’s quality of life and give them some control back over their bowel function. Constipation is an increasing problem in the Western world and it is widely accepted that approximately 50% of adults are constipated at any point in time. Constipation encompasses a multitude of symptoms; the general mental health and social functioning of people with constipation is impaired when compared to health controls. The symptoms of constipation occur in a large percentage of the general population. The impact on quality of life when they occur for a long period of time is large. However, patients often have many coexisting other pelvic floor disorders.

      "abstract": "Tourette syndrome is a chronic disorder with involuntary motor and vocal tics. Sleep problems are common due to increased tics and comorbid conditions like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and anxiety. Medications to treat tics or insomnia can cause daytime sleepiness. A 14-year-old male presents with the complaint of excessive daytime sleepiness of more than 1-year onset. He has a past medical history of Tourette syndrome, ADHD, anxiety, depression, and adenotonsillectomy due to recurrent pharyngitis. He is homeschooled, and sleeps between 10 pm to 6 – 10 am every day. Naps >2 h every day. Snoring, gasping and sleep talking are reported. His Epworth sleepiness score was 24. He denied hallucinations or cataplexy. He denied alcohol/drug abuse, trauma, hospitalization or family history of narcolepsy. Physical exam was unremarkable except BMI 35.29 kg/m2. His differential included obstructive sleep apnea vs. narcolepsy. His extended release guanfacine to treat tics was stopped, and Neurology held off starting an antidepressant for the sleep studies. The in-lab polysomnography showed an Apnea-Hypopnea Index = 0.6/h, Total Sleep Time = 7.8 h, Sleep Latency = 1 min, REM Latency = 47.5 min, Sleep Efficiency = 85%, and Periodic Limb Movement Index = 0/h. The Multiple Sleep Latency Test showed a Mean Sleep Latency in 5 naps = 7 min and Sleep-onset REMs = 3, meeting criteria for narcolepsy. Anti-streptolysin O was less than 200 IU/mL. Guanfacine was switched to nights to reduce daytime sleepiness. Amphetamine-dextroamphetamine was started at 5 mg BID due to palpitations and slowly increased to 20 mg extended release in the morning and 10 mg immediate release in the afternoon. Modafinil has also been added, and both sleepiness and tics are under control. This case reminds us that among other sleep related problems, narcolepsy can coexist in Tourette syndrome. It’s interesting that both conditions share an impaired hypothalamus‐hypophysis axis but are not commonly linked together. Management is a concern as stimulants can cause tics. We consider medically appropriate to assess and study their sleep problems and treating with stimulants when necessary to improve quality of life.",

      "title": "1171 Hypersomnia Secondary to Long Covid",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Recognition of Long Covid is increasing. In a recent meta-analysis in youth with Long Covid, the most prevalent clinical symptoms were mood (16.50%), fatigue (9.66%), and sleep disorders (8.42%). However, there is a paucity of data in the management of these symptoms. Report of case(s) We present a case of severe hypersomnolence after a mild Covid-19 infection in a 13 year-old female with no significant history, an acceptable age-appropriate sleep-wake schedule without nighttime awakenings or sleepiness prior to infection. Post-infection, she developed a one year history of sleep onset and maintenance insomnia, significant circadian delays, sleep inertia, brain fog and headaches. She was referred to sleep medicine and responded to treatment for a circadian rhythm disorder with sleep-wake restructuring, melatonin, and strict sleep hygiene. Sleep fragmentation, unrefreshing sleep, and hypersomnolence persisted; ESS=15/24. Sleep duration was often ≥12 hours in a 24 hour period. The patient could not wake easily, and often missed school or left early for sleepiness and headaches. A trial of gabapentin 200mg at bedtime failed. Sleep diagnostics were performed. Polysomnography showed no sleep disruptors, 8 hours of sleep, and some delayed slow wave sleep periods. Mean sleep latency testing (MSLT) showed MSL of 15.4min; 1 SOREM (nap #1). With a working diagnosis of hypersomnia due to medical condition vs. idiopathic hypersomnia, methylphenidate up to 36mg ER was trialed with some improvement. A recent adult case with Long Covid and ADHD-like syndrome also responded to stimulant use, though no guidelines are established for Long Covid. Oxybate was later added up to 2g once nightly which helped resolve sleep inertia, improve sleep quality and reduce sleepiness(ESS=4/24). She was able to return to school full time and reached normal functioning. Conclusion While the pathophysiology of Long Covid is still under investigation, symptom management of sleepiness can impact functioning. This case demonstrates a successful treatment of a patient with Long Covid and hypersomnolence with resolution of excessive sleepiness, morning inertia, and sleep fragmentation with a treatment approach similar to that of idiopathic hypersomnia, using an oxybate along with daytime stimulant use.

      "title": "Mood Changes in Bulimia Nervosa",
      "abstract": "Daily measurement of mood, and the occurrence of specific eating behaviours, were assessed concurrently over an eight-week period in a sample of 50 patients meeting diagnostic criteria for bulimia nervosa. Results of observer-rated scales of mood showed a significant reduction of scores, whereas self-assessment of mood showed no change over the study period. Negative mood states, although not severe, were more marked when the specific behavioural symptoms of binge-eating, vomiting, or purging occurred, and they increased as abnormal eating behaviours accumulated. It is suggested that the accompanying dysphoric mood states of bulimia nervosa are likely to be a secondary manifestation related to the presence of abnormal eating symptoms, and that they do no constitute a primary depressive illness.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Eating epilepsy (EE) is a rare form of reflex epilepsy precipitated by food. Ictal semiology may vary depending on the etiology, age at onset, and cerebral areas involved in the epileptogenic network. In childhood, EE could manifest as tonic head drop seizures, generalized seizures, or late-onset epileptic spasms. However, in teenagers or adults, seizures are often preceded by aura and commonly manifest as focal seizures with or without impaired awareness. Brain magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities are seen in less than half of the reported cases. Posterior or multifocal interictal discharges can be seen in patients with EE. No randomized data about treatment are available. Structural epilepsies or coexistent unprovoked seizures other than eating seizures are poor prognostic factors for pharmacological outcome.",

      "abstract": "DISPERSIBLE TABLETS: AN OVERVIEW Naveen Kumar*, Sonia Pahuja Swami Vivekanand College of Pharmacy, Banur, Punjab, India ABSTRACT The new drug delivery system helps to achieve better patient compliance. Rapid dispersible tablets are one of these. Dispersible Tablets has benefits such as accurate dosing, easy transportability and fabrication, good physical and chemical stability and an ideal alternative for pediatric and geriatric patients. The oral route of drug administration remains the most ideal route because of its various advantages, including ease of ingestion, pain evasion, versatility and, above all, patient compliance. The tablets and capsules are the most common solid dosage forms. On the other hand, many elderly people will have struggles to take the conventional solid dosage forms (tablets and capsules), due to dysphasia. Swallowing complications are also common in children’s because of their underdeveloped mucosal system. Other groups that may have trouble swallowing a solid dosage form are the psychologically ill, the developmentally disabled, and the non-cooperative patients. In certain circumstances, such as motion sickness, the sudden episode of an allergic attack or cough and the lack of water availability, the ingestion of tablets can be difficult. To meet these medicinal requirements, the pharmaceutical scientist has devoted significant effort to the development of a new type of dosage form for oral administration, the fast dispersible/ rapid dispersible tablets, and a tablet that disintegrates and dissolves rapidly in saliva without the requirement of water.

      "title": "A Study of Experimental Methods for Teaching Emotionally Disturbed, Brain Damaged, Retarded Readers",
      "abstract": "IN RECENT YEARS there has been a growing awareness that there is a distinct syndrome f r e quently associated with children who are slow learners, especially retarded readers, which has been characterized under such headings as hyper kinetic disorder (Laufer, Denhoff and Solomons, 1957), minimally brain damaged (Burks, 1957), visual-motor impairment (Strauss and Lehtinen, 1947), and primary reading disturb ance (Rabinovitch et al., 1956). Generally, these children are thought to have some central nervous system abnormality of function, subcortical or cor tical or both, which has interfered with their abil ity to receive or retain and reproduce visual, audi tory or motor cues, as well as inducing the behav ioral syndrome. Behaviorally, these children can often be identified in that they have a short atten tion span, are hyperactive, easily distracted, and readily overwhelmed by anything new or different. They reveal tendencies to perseverate, with con siderable difficulty in shifting, and poor ability to abstract and to generalize. In reading they often reverse words (such as saw for was), are unable to pronounce words and fail to develop effi cient techniques in reading new words. Their spell ing is usually quite poor because they have no un derstanding of letter sounds and have a poor con cept of phonics; there may be mirror writing with out awareness and their handwriting is often hard ly legible. These symptoms have been given de tailed attention by Strauss and Lehtinen (1947) and Strauss and Kephart (1955), and descriptions of these children can be found in recent artic les by Laufer et al., (1957) and Rabinovitch et al., (1956). The purpose of the present paper is to describe a remedial educational approach that has been found useful with children who evidence such diffi culties. This experimentation has been conducted at the Emma Pendleton Bradley Hospital, which is a residential treatment center for emotionally dis turbed children who have the potential of at 1 e a s t normal intelligence.",

      "abstract": "Assessment of motor development is an important part of the study of the neuropsychic development of children, which is carried out by a pediatrician during preventive examinations. To identify the causes of motor disorders, in addition to studying the anamnesis, it is necessary to conduct a physical examination of the child with the appointment of additional research methods. It is important to remember that developmental delay does not always indicate the presence of any disease but requires dynamic monitoring. However, if they progress, then these patients are more likely to be diagnosed with specific neuromuscular disorders. In this case, the pediatrician should pay attention to the neurological status of the child, assess visual acuity and hearing. At the same time, one should not forget that motor disorders are often combined with a general developmental delay (mental retardation) of the child. Fasciculation of the tongue, loss of motor skills, organomegaly, coarsening of facial features, increased levels of creatine phosphokinase (more than 3 times higher than normal), respiratory failure, in the presence of general weakness, a sharp deterioration in the child’s condition, accompanied by lethargy, vomiting, development of convulsive syndrome, disorders detected on MRI of the brain, are alarming symptoms that require urgent intervention by specialists (neurologist, genetics). Also, some hereditary (chromosomal and monogenic) diseases are often combined with the development of motor disorders. The best results are achieved if the early diagnosis of diseases accompanied by movement disorders is carried out using an interdisciplinary approach.",

Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder is a common comorbidity. Low academic performance must not be attributable to a more general condition such as intellectual disability, lack of educational opportunity, or low language proficiency. The learning difficulties are present from the early school years. The diagnostic assessment includes standardized academic achievement testing, review of academic records, and cognitive testing to rule out intellectual disability. Treatment includes specialized multimodal educational interventions in conjunction with academic accommodations. Pharmacologic treatment of comorbid psychiatric disorders may provide indirect benefit by helping the child better access educational interventions.",

      "title": "Central ocular motor disorders, including gaze palsy and nystagmus",
      "abstract": "An impairment of eye movements, or nystagmus, is seen in many diseases of the central nervous system, in particular those affecting the brainstem and cerebellum, as well as in those of the vestibular system. The key to diagnosis is a systematic clinical examination of the different types of eye movements, including: eye position, range of eye movements, smooth pursuit, saccades, gaze-holding function and optokinetic nystagmus, as well as testing for the different types of nystagmus (e.g., central fixation nystagmus or peripheral vestibular nystagmus). Depending on the time course of the signs and symptoms, eye movements often indicate a specific underlying cause (e.g., stroke or neurodegenerative or metabolic disorders). A detailed knowledge of the anatomy and physiology of eye movements enables the physician to localize the disturbance to a specific area in the brainstem (midbrain, pons or medulla) or cerebellum (in particular the flocculus). For example, isolated dysfunction of vertical eye movements is due to a midbrain lesion affecting the rostral interstitial nucleus of the medial longitudinal fascicle, with impaired vertical saccades only, the interstitial nucleus of Cajal or the posterior commissure; common causes with an acute onset are an infarction or bleeding in the upper midbrain or in patients with chronic progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and Niemann-Pick type C (NP-C). Isolated dysfunction of horizontal saccades is due to a pontine lesion affecting the paramedian pontine reticular formation due, for instance, to brainstem bleeding, glioma or Gaucher disease type 3; an impairment of horizontal and vertical saccades is found in later stages of PSP, NP-C and Gaucher disease type 3. Gaze-evoked nystagmus (GEN) in all directions indicates a cerebellar dysfunction and can have multiple causes such as drugs, in particular antiepileptics, chronic alcohol abuse, neurodegenerative cerebellar disorders or cerebellar ataxias; purely vertical GEN is due to a midbrain lesion, while purely horizontal GEN is due to a pontomedullary lesion. The pathognomonic clinical sign of internuclear ophthalmoplegia is an impaired adduction while testing horizontal saccades on the side of the lesion in the ipsilateral medial longitudinal fascicule. The most common pathological types of central nystagmus are downbeat nystagmus (DBN) and upbeat nystagmus (UBN). DBN is generally due to cerebellar dysfunction affecting the flocculus bilaterally (e.g., due to a neurodegenerative disease). Treatment options exist for a few disorders: miglustat for NP-C and aminopyridines for DBN and UBN. It is therefore particularly important to identify treatable cases with these conditions.",

      "abstract": "Parasomnias are defined as undesirable physical events or experiences that occur during entry to sleep, within sleep, or during arousals from sleep. The non REM (NREM) parasomnias include confusional arousals, sleepwalking, and sleep terrors. In children, NREM parasomnias occur out of stage N3 (first part of the night) but in adults can occur out of stages N1 or N2 during any part of the night. We describe a case of NREM parasomnia with atypical clinical presentation. A 21-year-old female with history of depression and anxiety was evaluated for sleep terrors, sleep walking and sleep eating since age 5. Over the period of past 4 years, her sleepwalking subsided, and was substituted with hallucinations. Patient woke up with loud screams and hallucinations, “living the dream” and was able to explain it to her parents with her eyes open, who eventually “woke her up out of the episode”. Dreams were violent with “death” as the usual theme, approximately 2 hours after sleep onset with complete recollection after waking up. She also endorsed excessive daytime sleepiness with adequate sleep time on actigraphy. Patient denied history of head trauma, encephalitis, epilepsy or family history of sleep disorders. She was treated with Alprazolam and Sertraline in the past 3 years without improvement. She underwent a carefully conducted PSG and MSLT, which was negative for sleep disordered breathing or hypersomnia disorders. Extended Video EEG monitoring captured multiple stage 2 screaming and looking under the bed episodes with patient describing, “dead dogs around and under her bed”. No epileptiform activity was seen. Patient was started on Protriptyline HCL 10 MG twice daily, which resolved her symptoms. Sleep hallucinations are relatively common in teens and young adults, usually visual and reduce with aging. This case highlights an unusual presentation of hypnopompic hallucinations in stage 2, patient opening her eyes and being able to describe her hallucinations before she is “woken out of her sleep”. Differential diagnosis includes disorders of NREM sleep arousals vs. epileptiform activity. Latter was ruled out with an extended video EEG monitoring. It’s also interesting to note that her symptoms resolved with tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), which was used due to failure of SSRI and benzodiazepine therapy in the past. TCA use has been described to control sleep hallucinations in narcolepsy, our case delineates their possible use in NREM hallucinations.",

Classically, it is defined as continuous or recurrent seizure activity lasting for longer than 30 min in which the patient does not regain baseline mental status.1 Commonly, intervention is recommended after only 5 min of seizure activity2 as neuronal damage may begin to occur after this period, and the longer a seizure continues, the less likely it is to stop spontaneously.3 It seems likely, however, that mortality and morbidity after prolonged seizures should often be dependent upon underlying aetiology rather than duration of seizure activity.4 Repetitive serial seizures (ie, seizure clusters with return to baseline between events, but occurring frequently enough to be highly disruptive) and non-convulsive status epilepticus are also relatively common in children with epilepsy and are associated with significant morbidity.5\n\nDiazepam, lorazepam and midazolam, the drugs most widely used to stop prolonged seizures, are members of the benzodiazepine family, a class of psychoactive drugs with varying hypnotic, sedative, anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant and amnesic properties.6 Differences in their affinity for receptor subtypes account for different pharmacological effects, in combination with widely varying pharmacokinetic profiles. These pharmacokinetic differences often impose specific routes of administration and specific formulations for individual members of the benzodiazepine family. The aim of this review is to detail their clinical pharmacology as it relates to their use in the management of prolonged seizures in children.\n\nBenzodiazepines produce their range of effects by modulation of the γ-aminobutyric acid receptor subtype A (GABAA). The GABAA receptor comprises five subunits; each receptor is assembled from a combination of polypeptides, most commonly two αs, two βs and one γ, although several other subunits exist (eg, δ, e, π, θ and ρ).7 The combination of different subunits governs the …",

      "title": "Functional bowel disorders and functional abdominal pain",
      "abstract": "The Rome diagnostic criteria for the functional bowel disorders and functional abdominal pain are used widely in research and practice. A committee consensus approach, including criticism from multinational expert reviewers, was used to revise the diagnostic criteria and update diagnosis and treatment recommendations, based on research results. The terminology was clarified and the diagnostic criteria and management recommendations were revised. A functional bowel disorder (FBD) is diagnosed by characteristic symptoms for at least 12 weeks during the preceding 12 months in the absence of a structural or biochemical explanation. The irritable bowel syndrome, functional abdominal bloating, functional constipation, and functional diarrhea are distinguished by symptom-based diagnostic criteria. Unspecified FBD lacks criteria for the other FBDs. Diagnostic testing is individualized, depending on patient age, primary symptom characteristics, and other clinical and laboratory features. Functional abdominal pain (FAP) is defined as either the FAP syndrome, which requires at least six months of pain with poor relation to gut function and loss of daily activities, or unspecified FAP, which lacks criteria for the FAP syndrome. An organic cause for the pain must be excluded, but aspects of the patient’s pain behavior are of primary importance. Treatment of the FBDs relies upon confident diagnosis, explanation, and reassurance. Diet alteration, drug treatment, and psychotherapy may be beneficial, depending on the symptoms and psychological features.",

      "abstract": "Eating disorders are mental illnesses that can have a significant and persistent physical impact, especially for those who are not treated early in their disease trajectory. Although many persons with eating disorders may make a full recovery, some may not; this is especially the case when it comes to persons with severe and enduring anorexia nervosa (SEAN), namely, those who have had anorexia for between 6 and 12 years or more. Given that persons with SEAN are less likely to make a full recovery, a different treatment philosophy might be ethically warranted. One potential yet scarcely considered way to treat persons with SEAN is that of a harm reduction approach. A harm reduction philosophy is deemed widely defensible in certain contexts (e.g. in the substance use and addictions domain), and in this paper we argue that it may be similarly ethically defensible for treating persons with SEAN in some circumstances.",

It is well recognized that a number of patients present with a feeding or eating disturbance that is difficult to classify and diagnose using DSM-IV criteria. 1 The frequent use of the diagnosis Eating Disorder Not Otherwise Specified 2 has been widely discussed. 3 In addition, there are a number of presentations familiar to clinicians working in this field that simply do not fit current diagnostic placeholders. This is particularly the case in presentations characterized by restricted or otherwise inadequate eating, most commonly seen in child and adolescent populations, 4 but also in adults. 5 Examples include individuals who eat only a very narrow range of foods, and those who restrict their food intake to cope with difficult feelings, an emotional crisis, or an unpleasant experience. Such individuals do not fit the existing DSM-IV feeding and eating disorder diagnoses; yet they can experience clinically significant levels of impairment in development or functioning, as well as potentially severe medical complications.",

      "abstract": "Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is associated with a range of symptoms (typically heartburn, acid regurgitation and dysphagia), which may or may not be accompanied by endoscopically evident esophagitis. A number of studies have demonstrated that health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in reflux disease patients is significantly impaired in comparison to the general population, regardless of the endoscopic findings. Furthermore, this impairment is comparable to or greater than that observed in other chronic conditions, such as diabetes, arthritis or congestive heart failure. Impaired HRQoL in GERD patients is a result of features such as disturbed sleep, reduced vitality, generalized body pain, an impaired sex life and anxiety about the underlying cause of the symptoms. Nocturnal symptoms of reflux disease appear to have a particularly marked impact on HRQoL. The burden of illness imposed by reflux disease on HRQoL also has an impact on productivity, both at and outside work. The impact of reflux disease on productivity is significant and comparable to that caused by headache or back pain. Effective treatment is available for reflux disease, and there is evidence that this can quickly restore HRQoL to levels observed in the general population. However, poor communication between physicians and patients is contributing to unacceptable levels of patient dissatisfaction. Understanding patients’ experience of GERD and its treatment through the study of HRQoL is one way to address this problem.",

It is usually attributed to a functional gastrointestinal disorder rather than an organic disease. In most cases, a comprehensive history and physical examination should enable one to make a positive diagnosis of functional disorder. The presence of alarm symptoms and signs, such as weight loss, gastrointestinal bleeding and chronic severe diarrhoea, warrants further investigations and referral to a paediatric gastrointestinal specialist. The mainstay of therapy in functional abdominal pain is education, reassurance and avoidance of triggering factors. While symptom-based pharmacological therapy may be helpful in patients who do not respond to simple management, it is best used on a time-limited basis due to the lack of good evidence of its efficacy. The primary goal of therapy is a return to normal daily activities rather than complete elimination of pain. In recalcitrant cases, psychological interventions such as cognitive behaviour therapy and relaxation training have proven to be efficacious.",

Three logical alternatives include: (1) the underlying disorder affects the autonomic and gastrointestinal systems independently; (2) autonomic dysfunction alters gastrointestinal processing directly; (3) gastrointestinal manifestations arise as a delayed, indirect consequence of autonomic dysfunction. The major gastrointestinal manifestations of dysautonomia include esophageal dysmotility such as achalasia, gastroparesis, and small bowel bacterial overgrowth in the upper tract. Lower tract disorders include diarrhea, fecal incontinence, and constipation. Sorting through the varied causes of these disorders requires a careful history and examination in each patient. Supportive diagnostic studies may include radionuclide imaging, motility examination, and electrogastrography. Autonomic studies can (1) distinguish a purely enteric from a more generalized dysautonomia; (2) provide surrogate information about motility; (3) differentiate primary (e.g., multiple system atrophy) from secondary (e.g., irritable bowel syndrome) dysautonomias as the etiology of gastrointestinal symptoms. Several new strategies are available for the treatment of gastroparesis, constipation, irritable bowel, and sphincteric incontinence.",

Generally, when consulted, the professional either doesn't have enough time or lacks the convincing arguments to solve the problem. In this article, a global vision of the infant anorexia is offered, with a particular reference on the frequent educational anorexia. A psycho-physiopathological circuit which can be usefull for its comprehension is proposed. A series of behaviour rules are indicated both for infants and young children; their purpose is to avoid further anorexia.",

      "abstract": "Chronic liver disease (CLD) is a progressive deterioration of liver functions for more than six months, whichincludes synthesis of clotting factors, other proteins, detoxification of harmful products of metabolism andexcretion of bile. The chronic liver disease represents a continuous and progressive process of hepaticfibrosis, liver tissue architectural distortion, and regeneration nodule formation. While fibrosis is usuallyirreversible, but it can be reversible in the initial stage of development. The transition time point of reversiblefibrosis to irreversible fibrosis is still not completely understood.1 Sleep disturbances, particularly daytimesleepiness and insomnia, are common problems reported by patients suffering from liver cirrhosis. Poorsleep negatively impacts patients’ quality of life and cognitive functions and increases mortality. Althoughsleep disturbances can be an early sign of hepatic encephalopathy (HE), many patients without HE stillcomplain of poor quality sleep.2 Progressive muscle relaxation is based upon the simple practice of tensing, ortightening, one muscle group at a time followed by a relaxation phase with release of the tension and improvessleep quality among patients with CLD.",

Therefore, the development and testing of drugs for epilepsy poses problems peculiar to the condition. Existing antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) are recognised to have effects on the central nervous system beyond seizure control. Awareness is growing, in particular, about effects on cognition and behavior. To achieve acceptance as a drug for chronic therapy, it is desirable for a new compound to have a sufficiently long elimination half-life (t12,el) such that once- or twice-daily dosing is all that is required; a half-life in the range of 15–30h is ideal. The chronic administration of AEDs capable of inducing liver enzymes may affect the new compound in one of two ways. Drugs with a high first-pass metabolism may have a reduced bioavailability.",

This occurs despite adequate opportunity, condition, and time for sleep to occur and is associated with impairment of daytime function. Patients with insomnia may describe frequent extended periods of wakefulness during the sleep period or persistent morning awakenings that are earlier than desired (terminal insomnia). Insomnia can be divided on the basis of its duration into transient or short-term (lasting only a few days to three to four weeks) or chronic (persisting for more than one to three months). This chapter on pharmacologic therapy of sleep disturbance will be limited to the treatment of chronic insomnia.",

They wax and wane spontaneously over time and look like fragments of normal movements. Their frequency may increase in situations of stress or challenge and during emotional excitement. The symptomatology is attenuated during sleep and by goal-oriented behavior/concentration. Tics can be voluntarly suppressed for limited periods of time; the sensory-motor phenomena before a tic may be used as signal. Apart from simple movements and vocal impulses, more complex motor (e.g., slapping oneself, hopping, copropraxia = obscene gesturing, echopraxia = imitation of others) and linguistic discharges (such as coprolalia = use of obscene language, palilalia = repetition of the most recently spoken syllables or words and echolalia = repetition of words spoken by others) can also occur. The combination of chronic (lasting longer than a year) vocal and multiple motor tics is termed Tourette syndrome (TS). The indication and choices for pharmaco therapy (e.g., tiapride, risperidone, aripiprazole) within a broader therapeutic framework will be presented, including the pharmacological strategy with comorbid mental disorders like ADHD and OCD.",

      "abstract": "The prognosis for those suffering from frequent seizures will be closely linked to their etiology (1). If there is extensive brain damage, whether this results from trauma, disease, or brain tumors, there is likely to be a poor response to whatever treatment is given. The more diffuse the lesions the worse this will be: and localisation is also a factor, for example mesial temporal sclerosis causing complex partial seizures. For these reasons patients who are mentally handicapped often have the additional handicap of epilepsy (2). The best chance of controlling the fits lies in making an accurate diagnosis and applying appropriate treatment, whether this is surgery to remove a tumor or the identification of a metabolic disorder which can be controlled, such as pyridoxine dependency or biotinidase deficiency (3). It is important to identify epileptic syndromes, often genetically determined, so that at least an accurate prognosis can be given, even if this does not effect treatment. For example the prognosis for infantile spasms and the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome are well known (4). Tuberous sclerosis is another diagnosis to be viewed with concern. Even within the field of epilepsy there are important diagnostic issues; for instance differentiating minor seizures from reflex anoxic seizures, and absence epilepsy and pseudoseizures from complex partial seizures (5).

      "abstract": "Insomnia is a public health problem and one of the most common complaints in medical practice. Sleep disturbances may manifest as difficulty falling asleep (sleep-onset insomnia), maintaining sleep continuity (waking in the middle of the night and difficulty going back to sleep) or waking too early in the morning long before the desired time (early morning insomnia). Insomnia can significantly affect daytime functioning, leading to waking up in the morning tired, reduced productivity, a tendency to make mistakes and have accidents, inability to concentrate, frequent daytime sleep and a poor quality of life. The etiology and pathophysiology of insomnia include genetic, environmental, behavioural and physiological factors. Although insomnia can affect any gender and age group, women and the elderly are more vulnerable and are more likely to develop insomnia. A detailed sleep history is key to assessing insomnia. Clinicians must be able to recognise sleep disturbances and rule out other sleep-related disorders. The aim of treating insomnia is to improve sleep and alleviate the distress or dysfunction caused by this disorder. Psychological therapy methods, drug therapy, or combinations of these methods can be used to treat insomnia. Some behavioural interventions are feasible in primary care, but lack of training in these methods limits theiruse. Various natural and over-the-counter drugs, such as melatonin-based drugs, are used as sleeping pills. Melatonin has been evaluated as a sleeping pill in different doses, demonstrating a small but significant effect on sleep latency.",

      "abstract": "Nausea is defined as a subjectively unpleasant sensation associated with awareness of the urge to vomit, and vomiting refers to a forceful expulsion of gastric contents from the mouth, or labored, spasmodic, rhythmic contractions of the respiratory muscles without expulsion of gastric contents. The conditions may be caused by multiple factors including organ failure, central nervous system disease, drug therapy, radiation, and gastrointestinal obstruction and pathology. Nausea and vomiting are often associated with other symptoms such as pain, anxiety, depression, shortness of breath, drowsiness, loss of appetite, and tiredness that can negatively influence patients’ activities of daily living and significantly impact their quality of life., The management of nausea and vomiting involves treatment of the underlying cause(s), supportive care measures, and the use of anti-emetics.,Anti-emetics are medications prescribed for the prevention of nausea and vomiting or use as a rescue treatment once symptoms develop. There are many classes of anti-emetic drugs, including 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, NK-1 receptor antagonists, corticosteroids, butyrophenones, antihistamines, anticholinergics, and phenothiazines. Ondansetron is the most well-studied 5-HT3 receptor antagonist and is considered by some to be the gold standard to which other anti-emetics are compared. Ondansetron is commonly prescribed in the form of standard oral pills or tablets. However, there are patients, including those in the palliative setting, for whom such formulations may not be suitable due to difficulty with swallowing caused by co-morbidities such as dysphagia.This report aims to identify and summarize evidence on the comparative clinical effectiveness of oral versus injectable ondansetron formulations in adult patients requiring medication to control nausea or vomiting. An additional objective is to synthesize evidence on the comparative clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of ondansetron versus other anti-emetic agents for palliative patients, as well as evidence-based guidelines for the use of ondansetron to control nausea or vomiting in that population.",

      "abstract": "Symptom Control at the End of Life Abstract. Patients with advanced disease suffer from multiple physical and psychological symptoms. These include pain, weakness, lack of energy, weight loss, breathlessness, nausea and vomiting, constipation, and depression. In the dying phase, death rattle, delirium and terminal agitation may be additional problems. Palliative care focusses on alleviating these symptoms, taking into account the physical, psychological, social and spiritual dimension. Main principles of symptom control in palliative care are 1) considering differential diagnoses of the causes of the symptom to be able to treat potentially reversible causes, 2) using preventive measures and 3) symptomatic treatment - on its own or in combination with causal therapy. The following should be noted regarding pharmacological treatment: In case of permanent symptoms, the drugs have to be given at fixed times, in accordance with their duration of action, to achieve a constant blood level. In addition to this regular drug administration, prn medication should be prescribed, e. g., for pain, breathlessness, and nausea. If oral administration is not possible, drugs can be administered intravenously, subcutaneously or transdermally via patches. Non-pharmacological measures can be used additionally or primarily for symptom control. This paper presents important aspects of symptom control for pain, breathlessness, nausea and vomiting, constipation, and depression as well as for symptoms in the dying phase. It concludes by adding a few words on sedation in palliative care as a measure of last resort.Zusammenfassung. Patient_innen in fortgeschrittenen Krankheitsstadien leiden unter vielfältigen physischen und psychischen Beschwerden. Dazu gehören Schmerzen, Schwäche, Energielosigkeit, Gewichtsverlust, Atemnot, Übelkeit, Erbrechen, Verstopfung und Depression. In der Sterbephase können Rasselatmung, Delir und / oder terminale Unruhe hinzukommen. Der Fokus palliativmedizinischer Behandlung liegt auf der Linderung dieser belastenden Symptome unter Berücksichtigung der körperlichen, psychischen, sozialen und spirituellen Dimension. Zu den Grundsätzen der palliativmedizinischen Symptomkontrolle gehören 1) eine angemessene differentialdiagnostische Ursachenklärung des Symptoms zur Behandlung potenziell reversibler Ursachen, 2) der Einsatz von präventiven Massnahmen und 3) die Durchführung einer symptomatischen Therapie – allein oder parallel zu einer ursächlichen Therapie. Bezüglich der medikamentösen Therapiemassnahmen ist Folgendes zu beachten: Bei dauerhaft vorhandenen Symptomen müssen die Medikamente entsprechend ihrer Wirkdauer nach einem festen Zeitschema gegeben werden, um einen möglichst konstanten Wirkspiegel zu erreichen. Zusätzlich zu einer solchen Dauermedikation ist zum Beispiel für Schmerzen, Atemnot und Übelkeit Bedarfsmedikation zu verschreiben. Wenn die orale Gabe nicht möglich ist, können Medikamente intravenös, subkutan oder transdermal mittels Pflaster verabreicht werden. Nichtmedikamentöse Massnahmen können ergänzend oder auch primär zur Symptomlinderung eingesetzt werden. Dieser Beitrag stellt wichtige Aspekte der Symptomkontrolle bei Schmerzen, Atemnot, Übelkeit und Erbrechen, Obstipation, Depression sowie bei Symptomen in der Sterbephase vor und schliesst mit wenigen Worten zum Thema «Sedierung in der Palliativversorgung» als Ultima-Ratio-Massnahme.",

The finding of IBS isn't affirmed by a particular test or underlying irregularity. It is made utilizing rules dependent on clinical symptoms like Rome criteria, except if the symptoms are believed to be atypical. Today the Rome Criteria IV is the current gold standard for the determinations of IBS. Treatment of patients with IBS requires many approaches.

      "abstract": "The importance of bidirectional brain-gut interactions in gastrointestinal (GI) illness is increasingly recognized, most prominently in the area of functional GI syndromes such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), functional dyspepsia, and functional chest pain. The brain receives a constant stream of interoceptive input from the GI tract, integrates this information with other interoceptive information from the body and with contextual information from the environment, and sends an integrated response back to various target cells within the GI tract. This system is optimized to assure homeostasis of the GI tract during physiological perturbations and to adapt GI function to the overall state of the organism. In health, the great majority of interoceptive information reaching the brain is not consciously perceived but serves primarily as input to autonomic reflex pathways. In patients with functional abdominal pain syndromes, conscious perception of interoceptive information from the GI tract, or recall of interoceptive memories of such input, can occur in the form of constant or recurrent discomfort or pain. This is often associated with alterations in autonomic nervous system output and with emotional changes. A model is proposed that incorporates reported peripheral and central abnormalities in patients with IBS, extrapolates similar alterations in brain-gut interactions to patients with other chronic abdominal pain syndromes, and provides novel treatment targets.",

A 28-year-old woman underwent surgery for acute necrotizing hemorrhagic pancreatitis, leading to admission for post-acute intensive treatment due to prolonged bed rest syndrome. Clinical examinations revealed sensory–motor neuropathy, denervation in the active phase, mammillary body hyperintensity, and cognitive impairment. The patient exhibited poor orientation, lacked awareness of her clinical condition, and experienced impaired nonverbal memory, practical constructive issues, and planning difficulties—consistent with WKS. The patient received high-dose thiamine (300 mg TDS), coupled with daily physiokinesitherapy and occupational therapy. A final neuropsychological evaluation three months later showed substantial remission of executive and memory difficulties, improved spatial–temporal orientation, and enhanced awareness. The complex case required timely multidisciplinary intervention for accurate diagnosis and effective rehabilitation. The patient experienced rapid clinical improvement and cognitive recovery with high-dose thiamine and physiotherapy.",

Attention encompasses generalized activation of the cognitive processes of orienting, filtering, and selecting inputs; preparing for action; and maintaining thought on a stimulus, mental activity, or goal. Attention, a vital foundation for higher cognitive functions, maintains a coherent stream of thought. The ability to sustain attention, or vigilance, is necessary for complex behaviors, such as understanding and remembering a story. Therefore, attention must be tested first, before other cognitive functions. An inattentive patient’s failure to perform calculations sheds no light on arithmetic skills. Rather, attentional dysfunction is a central feature of syndromes due to diffuse cerebral dysfunction such as delirium, as well as syndromes due to focal cerebral damage such as the neglect syndrome. In addition, attentional dysfunction often accompanies other cognitive impairments in such common neurological.",

If that discrete and sustained discharge occurs in the temporal lobe or limbic region of the brain, the condition is referred to as nonconvulsive complex partial status epilepticus (discussed in Chapter 10). If the discharge is ongoing in systems that subserve language function, an aphasia may result (see Chapter 11). This chapter will deal with the disorders and conditions associated with FSE arising from other regions of the brain. This condition can be associated with a wide variety of neurologic disorders and have a multitude of signs and symptoms. These signs and symptoms vary according to the function of the brain area engaged by the discharge and can be as simple as a repetitive movement, as seen in epilepsia partialis continua (EPC), or as subtle as an inability to write to command (see case example).",

We report one patient with symptomatic hypophosphatemia during starvation in anorexia nervosa who improved with repletion of phosphate and two others retrospectively noted to be hypophosphatemic.

The relationship of senile encephalomyelosis to senile anorexia, primary cachexia, senile hypochromic achylic anemia and pernicious anemia can be established. 5. Hypervitaminization, particularly treatment with vitamin B1, liver extract and nicotinic acid, seems to give very good results. 6. Every case of so-called senile delirium or of the apparent confusional and hallucinatory type of senile dementia should be examined from this point of view and tentative hypervitaminization should be instituted. 7.

Enuresis is diagnosed when children repeatedly urinate in inappropriate places, such as clothing (during the day) or the bed (during the night). In most cases, the child’s urination problem is involuntary in nature, and is perceived by the child as an unavoidable loss of urinary control. This condition is most likely a symptom of psychological stress, although physiological causes, such as bladder infection, should not be ruled out. In general, the causes of bedwetting are related to anxiety, life stress, and possibly trauma, both inside and outside the home. Psychological factors such as a stressful life situation (death of a parent) or birth of a new sibling, disturbed family patterns, and delay toilet training, personality characteristics, parenting style, anxiety or presence of other emotional problems may predispose factors of enuresis. Many Children with enuresis experience significant distress or impairment in their social, academic, or everyday lives and the disorder can also drastically affect their families.

      "abstract": "Aim. A synthesis of scientific literature data on the association of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) with gastrointestinal dysfunction and disturbances of the intestinal microbiota. Key points. ASDs belong to a group of neurodevelopmental disorders associated with genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors, and include conditions that are heterogeneous in clinical presentation and severity of psychopathological symptoms. ASD is often comes with various symptoms of gastrointestinal tract dysfunction referred to impaired intestinal barrier permeability. The consequence is the pervasion of external agents (food antigens, toxins, bacterial metabolites) into the blood and initiation or maintenance of the inflammatory process, which is the most important pathophysiological link in ASD. Particular attention is paid to the analysis of the mechanisms of impaired intestinal barrier permeability. It is necessary to develop strategies aimed at reducing the level of inflammation in complex therapy of patients with ASD. Conclusion. Patients with ASD, in addition to psychoneurological symptoms, often present somatic problems, which, however, may not be timely recognized due to their nonspecificity and the difficulty of differentiating behavioral reactions either associated with the disorder or being just a reaction to somatic ill-being.Moreover, the whole complex of clinical manifestations is mediated by a single systemic dysregulation of immunological and metabolic reactions and is inherently a different reflection of one process, requiring profound multidisciplinary treatment and the use of various therapy approaches.

      "title": "Fluoxetine Treatment of Anorexia Nervosa",
      "abstract": "ANOREXIA NERVOSA IS A SEVERE,TREATMENT-RESISTANT illness primarily affecting women. It has one of the highest all-cause mortalities, and the highest suicide rate of any psychiatric illness. Restriction of food intake, refusal to maintain adequate body weight, and disturbed thinking about food, weight, and body image are hallmarks of this illness. A prominent associated feature is profoundambivalenceabout therapeuticefforts (whethernutritional, psychological, or pharmacological) aimed at weight restoration. In addition to the classic pattern of extreme food restriction, a subset of patients also report binge eating and purgingbehaviors (the“binge-purgesubtype”).Co-occurring psychopathologyiscommon,especiallydepression,obsessivecompulsive disorder, and other anxiety disorders. In severely malnourished patients with anorexia nervosa, nutritional rehabilitation with weight restoration is the cornerstone of treatment, and this intervention often requires hospitalization. Psychotherapy is also a regular part of treatment. Preliminary evidence supports use of a specific familybased psychotherapy in adolescents with anorexia nervosa who still reside at home; effective alternative psychotherapies for adolescents have not yet been determined. For adults with anorexia nervosa there is some evidence supporting the use of cognitive behavioral therapy, and other potential psychotherapies for adults are in development. Psychopharmacology is also a common treatment strategy, although the evidence base for psychopharmacologic approaches for anorexia nervosa is quite limited. The existing literature on pharmacotherapy for anorexia nervosa is modest in size and striking for the diversity of medications that have been studied. Agents as diverse as lithium, various antipsychotics, cyproheptadine, tricyclic antidepressants, and tetrahydrocannabinol have been examined with generally negative results in small trials. This wide diversity of agents is clearly an indication of the remarkable challenges inherent in treating individuals who have anorexia nervosa, and also reflects the generally negative results to date in pharmacotherapy trials for this illness. Recently, there has been much interest in the use of serotonin reuptake inhibitors for acute treatment and relapse prevention in anorexia nervosa. Trials of acute treatment (ie, while patients are still at low weight) with fluoxetine have failed to demonstrate clinical benefit. Modestsized studies of fluoxetine for anorexia nervosa relapse prevention (after an initial weight gain) have shown both positive (n=35) and negative (n=33) results. In this issue of JAMA, Walsh and colleagues report the results of a placebo-controlled trial of fluoxetine in the relapse prevention treatment of anorexia nervosa. Participants were 93 women aged 16 to 45 years who were completing multimodal inpatient or day hospital treatment and had weight restoration to a body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters) of at least 19.0. The patients were randomly assigned to either placebo or fluoxetine, with a dosage goal of 60 mg/d (with decreases permitted for adverse effects and an increase to 80 mg/d permitted for clinical deterioration). A total of 12 months of treatment was provided, during which time all patients also received cognitive behavioral therapy. Relapse was defined as weight loss to a body mass index less than 16.5 or development of medical complications or imminent suicide risk or the onset of another severe psychiatric disorder. The results of the trial by Walsh et al did not support efficacy for fluoxetine in relapse prevention for anorexia nervosa. Response to fluoxetine was not different from placebo, whether measured in time-to-relapse, percentage of patients maintaining a body mass index of 18.5 or higher, or the percentage of patients meeting modified Morgan-Russell criteria for at least fair outcome (Morgan-Russell criteria provide a slightly broader assessment of anorexia nervosa treatment outcome, extending beyond simple weight restoration). Responsebysubtypeofanorexianervosa(restrictingvsbingepurge) was also examined. The authors note that since a previous fluoxetine trial with positive findings enrolled only participantswith therestrictingsubtypeofanorexianervosa, perhaps this subtype would respond to fluoxetine. In addition, given the efficacy of fluoxetine for purging in bulimia nervosa, patients with the purging subtype of anorexia nervosamighthavebeenexpected tohave faredbetterwith fluoxetine. However, analyses by subtype did not affect the results. Premature study termination, mainly due to treatment failures and patient-initiated withdrawals, was common, but the rate of premature termination did not differ between fluoxetineand placebo-treated patients. A variety of secondary outcomes were examined, including measures of eat-",

Patients were divided into two groups depending on the form of alcohol abuse: 1) periodic (drunk), 2) permanent. Alcohol dependence with a drunken form of alcohol abuse was characterized by the presence of more than one spontaneous or socially conditioned remission (more than one month of sobriety) for a year, a short period of hard consumption of alcohol before the development of a psychotic disorder, a shorter period or no control period of consumption alcohol. On the contrary, in patients with permanent drinking, in some cases, up to the development of a psychotic episode, patients could independently stop drinking. Psychotic disorders were more often observed in patients with the periodic (drunk) form of alcohol abuse. A provoking factor in the development of psychotic disorders (the presence of somatoneurological) disease, was more often more signifi cant in the group of patients with permanent form of alcohol abuse. In the case of a drunken form of alcohol abuse, more expressive vegetative signs of withdrawal syndrome (tachycardia, arterial hypertension, hyperhidrosis) were noted in the structure of the of alcoholic delirium. These patients had more expressive aff ective (mostly anxiety) and psychomotor agitation. Productive psychotic symptomatology (delusion, hallucinations) had a more signifi cant eff ect on the behavior of patients with a drunken form of alcohol abuse. In patients with permanent alcohol abuse, visual hallucinations were more often associated with tactile hallucinations. In this group, a prolongation of the psychotic disorder occurred more frequently due to the exacerbation of somatoneurological diseases, which often had at these patients.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Although the requirements for sleep do not appear to decline with aging, the ability to sleep and achieve consolidated sleep may decrease in some older adults. Approximately 50% of older adults complain of sleep disturbance. Older adults often take longer to fall asleep, have lower sleep efficiencies, and have more nighttime awakenings. They are also sleepier during the day than younger adults. Compared to elderly men, women are better able to maintain satisfactory sleep with aging. Aging is associated with changes in sleep architecture (Box 14–1). Greater nighttime sleep disturbance may lead to daytime sleepiness and more frequent daytime napping. Significant disturbances may occur during sleep with aging (Table 14–1). Although some of the observed changes can be attributed to normal aging itself (eg, age-related alterations in circadian rhythms), most are due to comorbid medical, neurologic, psychiatric, and primary sleep disorders.",

      "title": "Agenda for specialty section in addiction medicine",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Addictive behavior is any activity or behavior that has become the major focus of a person's life to the exclusion of other activities, or that has begun to harm the individual or others physically, mentally, or socially. Addictive behavior increases the risk of disease and/or associated personal and social problems. They are often experienced subjectively as \"loss of control\", that is, the behavior continues to occur despite volitional attempts to abstain or moderate use. Addiction implies psychological dependence, physical dependence, and a set of withdrawal symptoms if the substance is unavailable.[1] There are many common characteristics among the various addictive behaviors. First, the individual becomes obsessed (constantly thinks) of the object, activity, or substance and will seek it out, often to the detriment of work or interpersonal relationships. The person will compulsively engage in the activity even if he does not want to. Upon cessation of the activity, withdrawal symptoms of irritability, craving, and restlessness will often occur. The person does not appear to have control as to when, how long, or how much he will continue the behavior. He often denies problems resulting from his engagement in the behavior even though others can see the negative effects of it. Further, individuals with addictive behaviors will usually have low self esteem.[2] BURDEN OF PROBLEM Substance-related disorders have become matters of global concern because of impact on individual health, familial and social consequences, criminal and legal problems, and the effects on national productivity and economy. All the problems from use to dependence and from the most innocuous substance like tea/coffee to the most hard substances, contribute to the cost that the human society or a particular nation has to bear. In India, although alcohol use in ancient times and cannabis/affim (opium) in more recent times have been known and reported for some time, substance use problems have been recognized to have a significant importance as a public health problem only very recently. They are of particular concern among slum dwellers, transport workers, and youth.[3] Tobacco is the substance most easily accessible worldwide as well as in India. About one-fifth of the Indian population abuse tobacco, about 70% of this in the smoking form.[4] Passive smoking is a significant health hazard. There are 700,000 deaths per year due to smoking and 800,000–900,000 deaths per year due to all forms of tobacco use in India. Many of the deaths (>50%) are occurring below 70 years.[5] An estimated 34–42% of adult Indian population reports having used alcohol in their lifetime; 5–7% has been estimated to be abuser of alcohol; and 10–20 million persons have been estimated to be in need of treatment for dependence. A survey in India revealed that medical professionals had a higher rate of use and heavy use than general population.[5] Nearly 20–30% of admissions and consultations are due to alcohol-related problems in different healthcare settings but are under-recognized by primary care physicians.[6] With respect to heroin, India has now changed from being a transit country to a user country. General population surveys in India show opioid abuse rate as high as 24.8%. Another great concern especially with injectable opioids is spread of AIDS. Further, cannabis abuse in general population in India is 33% and abuse of tranquilizers is as high as 54%.[3] Remediation at central level: 'The Drug Deaddiction Program' was started in 1987–88 with the establishment of five deaddiction centers in central institutions, viz. AIIMS, New Delhi; Dr. RML Hospital, New Delhi; Lady Harding Medical College and Hospital; New Delhi; JIPMER, Pondicherry; and PGI, Chandigarh. The center at NIMHANS, Bangalore was established later as the sixth center. More recently, in 1999, a separate deaddiction center with inpatient setup was started in Central Institute of Psychiatry, Ranchi. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare is mainly involved in providing treatment services to the addicts, whereas the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment deals with other aspects of the problem like awareness creation, counseling, and rehabilitation. From 1992–93, the scope of the scheme was enlarged to include assistance to State Governments/Union Territories for developing deaddiction centers in identified medical colleges/district-level hospitals. WHAT WORKS IN SUBSTANCE-USE DISORDERS? Treatment of substance-use disorders typically involves a combination of pharmacotherapy and psychosocial interventions. Techniques for medically assisted detoxification are widespread and effective. The following are the different strategies that are found useful in management of substance dependence.[7] i) Home versus inpatient detoxification Published reports have consistently failed to find any difference in outcome between long and short inpatient detoxification programs. Clients can usually complete home detoxification in 5–9 days. In ideal circumstances they are visited twice daily for the first three days and medication is supervised by a relative. Clients are breathalyzed and medication withheld if they have consumed significant amounts of alcohol. ii) Brief interventions Brief interventions are short, focused discussions (often of less than 15 minutes) that can reduce alcohol consumption in some individuals with hazardous drinking. They are designed to promote awareness of the negative effects of drinking and to motivate change. Brief interventions were shown to be moderately effective in the nontreatment-seeking groups, especially for those with less-severe alcohol problems. iii) Abstinence versus controlled use This is a great debate. The goal of controlled (moderate or nonproblem) drinking usually includes some limit on alcohol consumption (e.g., 4 units/day) provided that drinking does not lead to signs of dependence, intoxication, or social, legal and health problems. This runs contrary to the abstinence-based philosophy of Alcoholics Anonymous. Controlled drinking may be an option for young, socially stable drinkers with short, less-severe drinking histories. An individual's belief that controlled drinking is an achievable goal is also a good prognostic factor. Most authors agree that controlled drinking should not be recommended for people with heavy dependence. Controlled drinking is an attractive option for public health strategies aimed at nondependent problem drinking. This principle can also be tried for other substances. iv) Alcoholic Anonymous Based on Minnesota model, they involve the recognition that alcoholism is a relapsing illness that requires complete abstinence. Clients acknowledge the problems due to their alcoholism and are encouraged to attend 90 meetings in 90 days. Participants may engage the support of a sponsor who is an AA member who has been sober for at least one year. Similarly, there is narcotic anonymous for opioid addicts and nicotine anonymous for nicotine dependents. The evidence suggests that this twelve-step approach is at least as effective as most structured psychotherapies but not superior to any alternative treatments. v) Psychological therapies Motivational enhancement therapy Cognitive behavioral therapy Social skills training Community reinforcement approach Social behavior and network therapy Contingency management Cue exposure vi) Therapeutic community It requires prolonged residence (often 12–18 months) and it is extremely expensive. Most studies of therapeutic communities are conducted without control groups and the lack of randomization probably leads to selection bias in favor of more motivated patients. vii) Drug treatments Disulfiram, naltrexone, and acamprosate are currently the only treatments approved for the management of alcohol dependence. Other drugs which have been used for the same are topiramate, citrated calcium carbimide, SSRIs, tiapiride, nalmefene, metronidazole, and ondansetron. The oldest among these is disulfiram, being used from 1950s. Naltrexone was launched in India in 1998 and acamprosate in 2002. However, none has been proved to be significantly better than the other agents. In other words, all are equally effective.[5] Bupropion has been said to be the first line drug for nicotine craving. Another first line agent is nicotine itself, in the form of gum, inhaler, lozenge, patch, and nasal spray. Clonidine and nortriptyline are said to be the second line drugs. But the success rate with each of these drugs is marginal.[8] Sustained release bupropion is also considered to be effective as anticraving agent in cannabis dependence. Nefazodone also significantly reduces cannabis withdrawal related anxiety and muscle pain, while having no effect on dysphoria. The embryonic work on CB1 selective cannabinoid receptor antagonists such as SR141716 (rimonabant) has demonstrated that it successfully blocks the acute psychological and physiological effects of smoked cannabis in experienced human consumers and is well tolerated. There has been even less work on the use of cannabis agonists. However, this is a promising area for future research as a number of oral and inhaled THC preparations are being developed for medical cannabis trials.[9] Maintenance treatment is increasingly emphasized as the main therapy of opioid dependency. Abstinence-oriented therapy is nevertheless an important alternative, mainly psychological, and has considerable advantages for those benefitting from this strategy. Methadone or buprenorphine in tapering doses are used for detoxification along with α2 adrenergic agonists like clonidine or lofexidine. Time-limited agonist therapy is a specific approach using agonist stabilization as the basis for therapeutic interventions preceding tapering off of the maintenance therapy. The preventive effect of naltrexone and other antagonists is well known but the attrition rate is very high. It is also feasible for addicts to be introduced to naltrexone by detoxification under anesthesia or sedation.[10] ADDICTION MEDICINE AS A SPECIALTY As elaborated above, substance use is affecting a disproportionately large section of people of India. The prevalence is more than that of all severe mental disorders combined. When it comes to health problems, it should not be gauged merely by its prevalence, but by the health burden and social cost that it wreaks on the society. Psychiatric comorbidities like mood, anxiety, and psychotic disorders are also very commonly associated with substance dependence. Thus drug addiction is a titanic problem that needs special clinical attention. Today we are equipped with an arena of treatment strategies, both pharmacological and nonpharmacological. What we need is just an improvisation in its implementation. Treatment can be better systematized when addiction medicine is upgraded as a specialty. The specialty section on addiction medicine needs to fulfill the following aims and objectives.[6] Promote and advance the bio-psycho-social contributions to the science and practice of addiction medicine in all its different manifestations. Promote the improvement of the health of persons directly or indirectly impacted by substance-related problems. Promote prevention, control, treatment, and relief of all substance-related problems, as well as conditions which constitute high risk for potential drug-related problems. This involves encouraging and enabling the members of the society to explore and pursue 'evidence based' treatment strategies and prevention methods. This includes liaison with other stake holders, including but not limited to government agencies overseeing health, social justice and welfare, and finance and human development; nongovernmental agencies involved in direct care of persons with substance abuse. Promote other medical specialties and primary healthcare providers. This also requires sharing the expertise of members of the society and other professionals involved in diverse fields such as school mental health, community based rehabilitation, epidemiology, drug trials, maintaining disease registries, to mention a few. Actively engage in advocacy in order to influence policy making and legislation, keeping in mind that substance-use disorders and their consequences constitute a grave public health disorder which imposes an unacceptably severe burden on the health and well being of the people of India. Formulate and recommend standards of treatment and rehabilitation of persons or populations affected directly or indirectly by substance-use disorders. In addition, it will be necessary to obtain recommendations for syllabi and commission resources for the education and training of medical and nonmedical personnel involved in the field. Safeguard the interest of psychiatrists and fellow professionals engaged in the practice of addiction medicine in India. Promote research in the field of addiction science with a focus on translating the benefits of research to the bedside and propagate the use of evidence-based interventions in the daily delivery of mental healthcare. FUNCTIONING OF ADDICTION MEDICINE AS A SPECIALTY SECTION The following are some of the activities that are being suggested as functions of specialty section of addiction medicine:[6] A web portal, linked to the web page of the Indian Psychiatric Society, which will initially host information of relevance to the practice of addiction medicine in India, with direct and indirect links to published or unpublished scientific papers, databases, treatment protocols, available treatment agencies, online resources, etc; and later e-learning sites for online education and training. Coordinating Continuing Medical Education (CME) pertaining to the aspect of the science and practice of addiction medicine, with special emphasis on underserved areas like the northeastern states, Andaman and Nicobar Islands, etc. Enabling and commissioning position papers on the impact of substance abuse in India, with a view to influence public policy. Engaging with relevant organizations to promote demand-reduction strategies, such as the police to prevent drinking and driving, primary health providers, and emergency rooms for early detection and brief intervention Pursuing the aim of working to safeguard vulnerable populations, for example, inoculating children and adolescents through skills training and sensitizing physicians and pharmacists to prevent over the counter drug abuse. Examining the possibility of creating a national registry, using standardized data-entry protocols. CONCLUSION Substance-use disorders form more than 20% of the case load of psychiatric practitioners. However, practitioners have an attitude of therapeutic nihilism toward the addicted patient. This may be due to various reasons like lack of education about alcohol and substance abuse, attitude of hostility or aversion toward alcoholics, inability or discomfort to deal with the associated psychosocial issues, and learned pessimism about treatment – especially based on experience treating late stage alcoholics. However for effective outcome, early identification and treatment should be the goal. This is possible with more sophistication in the science of addiction medicine. Thus, evolving of a specialty section of addiction medicine is the need of the day.",

Symptomatic behaviors too quickly get entrenched and need to be urgently addressed. Particularly with the eating-disordered teen, treatment goals must include immediate intervention with eating behaviors while, at the same time, attempting to reach the disowned part of the patient, often hidden behind bingeing, purging, or other disordered behaviors. This work involves an expansion of the unwitting but often hierarchical structure of contemporary treatment. Understanding dissociation as an interpersonal enactment as opposed to developmental impairment allows patient and therapist to work in tandem to search for the parts of the patient hidden behind food and weight obsessions. The goal is not merely symptom reduction but also to find the part of the patient who is reluctant to enter the room.",

Cramps and contractures may be identical clinically. The former is more common in neurogenic disease, whereas in myopathies they are more likely to be contractures or myotonia. True cramps occur without provocation. If they are exercise induced (in which the pain has a quasistoichiometric relation to muscle work), they are more suggestive of contractures and suggest abnormal muscle metabolism. Other features of cramps are explosive onset, occurrence in parts of one muscle, occurrence at rest (especially in a muscle in a contracted position) or after triggering movement (either minor or forceful), and relief by passive stretch.",

      "abstract": "Belly dancer’s dyskinesia or syndrome is a rare condition characterized by involuntary, undulating, infrequent diaphragm movements. The etiologies for this disorder include nervous system disorders (peripheral or central), drug-induced, psychological, or idiopathic. This article describes a 10-year-old boy with an underlying psychological stressor who suddenly experienced involuntary abdominal wall movements after salbutamol nebulization. After a detailed history, physical examination, and abdominal ultrasound that revealed rapid rhythmic diaphragm movements, the child was diagnosed with salbutamol-induced belly dancer's dyskinesia with an underlying psychological problem. These movements subsided with medical and psychological therapy for two weeks. Belly dancer’s dyskinesia is a complex disorder that is difficult to diagnose but can be managed with medical treatment and psychological counseling alone in a few patients. In contrast, in other cases, surgical intervention may be required.",

Alterations in sleep patterns for these reasons should not be mistaken for difficult behaviour. If serious, they call for treatment not recriminations. There may be other, quite different, causes at this age, requiring special advice or treatment. Mayth: Many teenagers do not go to sleep until late and are difficult to get up in the morning, as well as lying in bed at weekends until very late, because of bad habits.This is not necessarily the case. Fact: This pattern may be an actual sleep disorder that is partly due to physiological changes at puberty and which requires treatment.",

      "abstract": "Swallowing disorders (or dysphagia) are common in the elderly and their prevalence is often underestimated. They may result in serious complications including dehydration, malnutrition, airway obstruction, aspiration pneumonia (infectious process) or pneumonitis (chemical injury caused by the inhalation of sterile gastric contents). Moreover the repercussions of dysphagia are not only physical but also emotional and social, leading to depression, altered quality of life, and social isolation. While some changes in swallowing may be a natural result of aging, dysphagia in the elderly is mainly due to central nervous system diseases such as stroke, parkinsonism, dementia, medications, local oral and oesophageal factors. To be effective, management requires a multidisciplinary team approach and a careful assessment of the patient's oropharyngeal anatomy and physiology, medical and nutritional status, cognition, language and behaviour. Clinical evaluation can be completed by a videofluoroscopic study which enables observation of bolus movement and movements of the oral cavity, pharynx and larynx throughout the swallow. The treatment depends on the underlying cause, extent of dysphagia and prognosis. Various categories of treatment are available, including compensatory strategies (postural changes and dietary modification), direct or indirect therapy techniques (swallow manoeuvres, medication and surgical procedures).",

      "abstract": "Smell and taste disorders can be challenging to diagnose because of the large number of potential etiologies. Patients are often unable to provide a clear history of symptoms, because they frequently cannot distinguish between difficulties with smell and taste. Standardized questionnaires may be helpful in diagnosis. Smell and taste dysfunction have been implicated in loss of appetite, unintended weight loss, malnutrition, and reduced quality of life. Taste dysfunction may be complete or partial, and affect one or more aspects of taste (sweetness, bitterness, sourness, saltiness, and umami [savory]). An estimated 95% of taste disorders are caused by impairment of smell rather than gustatory loss. The most common causes of olfactory dysfunction include allergic rhinitis, chronic rhinosinusitis (with or without sinonasal polyps), and upper respiratory infection. Other potential causes include head trauma, neurodegenerative diseases (including Parkinson disease and cognitive impairments), and medications. Examination of the nose, mouth, and oropharynx as well as neurologic examination (focusing on cranial nerves I, VII, IX, and X) is essential. Additional assessment such as cognitive testing, nasal endoscopy, computed tomography of the sinuses or nose, or brain magnetic resonance imaging may be indicated. Up to one-half of patients with olfactory dysfunction improve over time. Improvement in olfactory function is inversely correlated with severity and duration of loss, age, smoking, and male sex.",

      "title": "Let's Focus on Frailty",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Frailty may be a clinical condition during which a person's vulnerability to acquiring dependency and/or mortality increases after they are subjected to a stressor.[1] Frailty is most regularly characterized as an aging-related disorder of physiological decline, characterized by marked vulnerability to unfavorable health outcomes, such as comorbidities, polypharmacy, the loss of independence, increasing hospitalizations, and mortality, improving the care for the most vulnerable subset of patients by frailty awareness and associated risks for adverse health outcomes. The physical frailty is \"A medical syndrome with multiple causes and contributors that are characterized by diminished strength, endurance, and reduced physiologic function that increases an individual's vulnerability for developing increased dependency and/or death.\"[2] Frail people usually have three or more than five symptoms such as unintentional weight loss (10 or more pounds within the past year), muscle loss and weakness, fatigue, reduced walking speed, and reduced levels of physical activity. WHAT ARE CONSEQUENCES OF FRAILTY? Frailty is viewed as a geriatric disorder with various causes and contributors portrayed by reduced strength, perseverance and diminished physiologic capacity, and increasing a person's weakness for developing disability.[1] As one of the fundamental causes of functional decrease in the elderly, sarcopenia has a high clinical effect, influencing the status and recuperation of an individual's mobility, independence, and quality of life conveys an increased danger for chronic frailty which results in falls, disability, hospitalization, and mortality.[3] WHAT ARE the RISK FACTORS FOR FRAILTY? The elements related with frailty, especially sociodemographic factors such as age, gender, and educational level, just as actual factors, for example, body weight and activities of daily living.[4] Malnutrition, inactivity, and comorbidities have a high antagonistic effect in older people and are risk factors for sarcopenia and physical frailty. The loss of muscle mass, strength, and function, called sarcopenia, is a key factor in the development of physical frailty. WHAT IS ORAL FRAILTY? Oral frailty is characterized as a progression of phenomena and cycles that lead to changes in different oral conditions (number of teeth, oral cleanliness, oral capacities, and so forth) related with aging, and accompanied by diminished interest in oral health, decreased physical and mental reserve capacity, and an expansion in oral frailty prompting to eating dysfunction; the general impact is of deteriorating physical and mental capacity.[5] HOW TO ASSESS THE ORAL FRAILTY? Oral assessments comprised of 16 measures including five dental status, eight oral functions, and three subjective difficulties. The 16 measures were as follows: dental status – number of natural teeth and functioning teeth, community periodontal index, tongue thickness as a marker of oral nutrient status, and turbidity of mouth-rinsed water as a marker of oral hygiene. Oral functions – maximum occlusal force, chewing ability as a marker of general masticatory performance, maximum tongue pressure, repetitive saliva-swallowing test (RSST), articulatory oral motor skill for \"pa, ta, ka\" and experience of dry mouth measured-oral wettability. Subjective assessments – difficulties in eating and swallowing, and using the questionnaire chewing ability, RSST, xerostomia. Oral frailty – the accumulation of a slightly poor status of oral conditions and function, strongly predicts physical frailty, dysphagia, malnutrition, need for long-term care, and mortality. IS ORAL FRAILTY LINKED TO PHYSICAL FRAILTY? A hypothesis for the connection between poor oral health and frailty is that poor diet intervenes the impact of poor oral health (like loss of teeth, dental agony, or potentially biting issues), prompting to frailty.[6] Poor eating routine and nutritional risk have for some time been involved in the etiology and progression of frailty by affecting useful functional reserves and strength and leading to loss of energy, functional decline, morbidity, and subsequent frailty. Oral frailty was essentially connected with physical frailty by 66.6% and sarcopenia by 72.7%. Poor oral condition in hospitalized patients can be attributed to factors such as age, physical dependency, psychological decline, malnutrition, low skeletal muscle mass and strength, and multimorbidity.[7] WHAT ARE the POLICY IMPLICATIONS? The proof from frailty studies has not yet been completely converted into clinical practice and medical care strategy making. As of now, in any case, there is no viable treatment for frailty and the best intervention is not yet known. In view of presently available proof, the multicomponent exercise, which incorporates resistance training, appears to be promising.[8] The current challenges in frailty research incorporate the absence of a worldwide standard meaning of frailty, further comprehension of interventions to reverse frailty, the best planning for intervention, and education/training of health-care professionals. Population-based evaluation for frailty could be costly and resource intensive, and as of now, there is no obvious proof for expected advantage, cost-adequacy, or improved results. Research and development efforts aimed toward building up and spreading best practice in frailty should not lack strategic consideration regarding older people with early (pre-) frailty that passes up on a chance to address a few requests on health and social care services. Another significant space of delicacy research is schooling and preparing The medical services experts including doctors, attendants, and other medical workers need to comprehend essential standards of care for frail older adults and to have the option to distinguish frailty and give therapy/interventions. There is an increasing interest in frailty in other medical fields than the geriatrics One model is that frailty has recently been pursued as a potential risk assessment measure for older surgical patients and has demonstrated to be promising in anticipating postoperative intricacies, for example, mortality or length of emergency clinic stay. Finally, frailty research may have evolved without considering the patient perspective Frailty can be considered as a profoundly adverse term and being marked as frail may influence contrarily the weakest people differently. The individuals who were marked as \"old and fragile\" by others were bound to be related with a loss of interest in friendly and proactive tasks, poor physical health, and increased disparagement. The future innovative work endeavors need to recognize the risks of naming older individuals in defaming ways and stay away from turning into the new cloak of ageism and an instrument for segregation.[8] Financial support and sponsorship Nil.

We report on a 9 month-old infant with myoclonic attacks, which consisted of frequent clusters of up to 10 symmetric jerks affecting mainly the arms and the head occurring as reflex responses to unexpected auditory stimuli. There was no family history of epilepsy or febrile convulsions. Ictal EEG demonstrated a typical 3 Hz spike-wave pattern, while there were no abnormalities, either in wakefulness or during sleep. The neurodevelopmental examination was unremarkable and MRI of the brain was normal. The attacks disappeared 3 weeks after initiating sodium valproate, and have not reappeared since then (follow-up 3 years and 3 months); today, at 4 years of age, the patient has normal psycho-motor development.

      "title": "Enhancing Functional Capacity for Clients with Physical Limitations Associated with Multiple Sclerosis",
      "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a progressive neurological disease of the central nervous system, and it is most prevalent in the adult population. The central nervous system is made up of the brain and the spinal cord (Figure 1). When a person has a diagnosis of MS, their immune system attacks the protective coating of nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord. The protective coating is known as myelin. If myelin is missing on nerve fibers, a plaque will develop in its place, and communication along the nerves will be interrupted. The disruption of communication between the brain or spinal cord and the body can result in movement, sensory, and/or mental impairments. For example, when the brain is trying to communicate to the arm to move, the communication will be slowed or blocked (Lundy-Ekman, 2018), and as a result, the arm's movement will be limited or absent.Signs and symptoms that result from MS may include weakness, limited motor movement and coordination, impaired vision, double vision, limited sensory abilities, and impaired or slurred speech. In addition, one may have difficulty with memory, concentration, and attention (Lundy-Ekman, 2018). The signs and symptoms of MS may fluctuate, yet as the disease progresses, symptoms often become permanent. The visual, sensory, movement, and cognitive problems that may develop with MS can greatly impact functional abilities for adults in the areas of self-care, productivity, and leisure activities. This article will focus on strategies for improving function for individuals with visual and physical deficits that are associated with MS.The plaques that develop with MS can cause inflammation to the optic nerve, anywhere along the optic nerve's pathway, and/or in the visual cortex, which is found in the occipital lobe (Figure 2). Symptoms of visual impairment may include blurry vision, double vision, or visual field loss. Visual deficits may include a partial or complete loss of vision, depending upon the disease process. As with all symptoms from MS, vision impairment fluctuates, depending on whether or not the individual is in an exacerbation. An exacerbation is a period of time when the symptoms of MS flare, and therefore, vision can worsen.The plaques that develop with MS can also cause inflammation to the motor cortex, sensory cortex, or cerebellum in the brain or anywhere along the spinal cord (Figure 1 and Figure 2). As a result, a person may have weakness in the trunk, arms, or legs, an abnormal or loss of sensation, poor balance, and limited endurance for daily activities. Again, sensory, motor, balance, strength, and endurance will worsen when one is having an exacerbation. In addition, another symptom that is associated with MS is systemic fatigue, which can be commonly reported in periods of exacerbation. Fatigue may negatively impact one's ability to engage in important activities of daily living, such as self-care, productivity, and leisure. Furthermore, the persistent fatigue that is associated with MS can have psychosocial implications, such as depression and social isolation, and consequently, it can further affect a person's level of participation and involvement in various aspects of life.While symptoms associated with MS vary from client to client, there are strategies to support an individual's ability to continue to complete meaningful activities to some degree. These strategies include the incorporation of energy conservation techniques, including activity modification, environmental modification, ergonomic principles, adaptive equipment, and assistive technology.Energy conservation techniques (ECTs) involve the planned management of the client's energy levels by balancing activity with rest, particularly during episodes of fatigue or exacerbation. ECTs help maintain valued activities and can be integrated throughout a daily routine. Some examples of ECTs include activity modifications, environmental modifications, principles of ergonomics, and the use of adaptive equipment or assistive technology. Sensory limitations brought on by MS can be taxing for an individual, especially when weakness, a lack of sensation, and visual deficits coexist. The successful adoption of ECTs requires client education on ways to incorporate scheduled rest, simplification of activities, and planning of energy expenditure and may include training on the use of adaptive equipment.Activity modification is an example of an ECT that can help to minimize labor, increase efficiency, and prevent fatigue in activities or tasks. Examples of activity modification include sitting instead of standing while chopping vegetables in a meal preparation activity or planning a task ahead of time to avoid unwanted energy expenditure. An example of planning a task ahead of time is organizing transportation before going to a scheduled appointment. It can also include prioritizing specific tasks, such as doing laundry at a time of the day when energy levels are higher or eliminating tasks by delegating them to others in an effort to save energy.Environmental modifications create a safe and more efficient environment for the client in order to maximize function. Examples of environmental modifications may include proper lighting throughout the home, the provision of accessibility to equipment and tools in the bathroom or kitchen, the removal of hazards such as throw rugs, and the incorporation of contrast on appliances or to mark doorways or stairs. Proper lighting includes the placement, such as overhead lighting or task lighting, the direction of the light with blinds or lamp shades, and the use of an appropriate type of bulb, such as a dimmable or anti-glare LED. Simple environmental solutions can be easily implemented and can optimize a client's function and independence.Incorporating ergonomic principles to avoid improper posture or positioning may be another way to conserve energy. Techniques such as using pillows to help maintain an upright posture in a sitting task or positioning reading materials within the field of vision are examples of ergonomic principles.The use of adaptive devices may assist in energy conservation for daily tasks. Examples of adaptive devices include a reacher or long-handle shoehorn to facilitate putting shoes on without having to bend over, an electric can opener, or the use of a rolling cart to transport objects instead of carrying them. Lightweight plates and built-up utensils for eating may also facilitate feeding for an individual with weakness. Adaptive equipment can be tailored to each individual's unique needs and can serve to reduce energy expenditure in daily activities.Assistive technology (AT) consists of low-tech and high-tech devices that can be useful for clients who are suffering from visual deficits and physical limitations, such as grasping, manipulating, or reaching. Electronic aids to daily living (EADLs) are technologies that can make a home operable with the touch of a remote control, such as the remote control of lights and appliances. Other kinds of AT may include electronic alarms and timers, features for smart phone technology that allow for messages to be read or magnified for low vision, and low vison magnifiers for use in the community.While the symptoms associated with MS are progressive in nature, there are strategies that one can implement to curtail the physical, sensory, and psychosocial limitations associated with this illness. The strategies discussed above are ones that can easily be adopted to aid in maintaining function in everyday activities. In addition, the maintenance of functional abilities contributes to psychosocial factors. Psychosocial well-being is maintained by the client's engagement in meaningful activity. For example, a loss of function can greatly impact a client's ability to socialize and participate in the community. Optimizing function for MS clients by incorporating energy conservation techniques and other strategies contributes to overall wellness and quality of life.",

Warning signs of serious problems include constant pain in a child younger than 11 years of age that lasts for several weeks or occurs spontaneously at night, repeatedly interferes with school, play or sports, or is associated with marked stiffness and limitation of motion, fever or neurologic abnormalities. Pain at the lumbosacral junction may suggest spondylolysis or spondylolisthesis. Scheuermann disease is diagnosed by the observance of wedging, irregularity or growth disturbance of three successive vertebrae. Musculoligamentous pain may result from injury to or overuse of muscles or joints of the back.

According to DSM-IV, NE is defined as repeated voiding, accidental or on purpose, into clothing or into the bed, at least twice a week, for 3 consecutive months, in children older than 5 years, age in which the sfincterial control is acquired. The pathophysiology of NE is not fully understood. It has been suggested that NE is the result of a combination of osmoregulatory or urodynamic disturbances, disorders of arousal and genetic factors. The evaluation of a child with minctional disorders begins with a good history and a physical examination. Then laboratory analysis and instrumental investigations can be used. There are pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments for NE. The role of drugs is a short-term possibility that allows the child to recover confidence, or a temporary measure to tide him/her over nights spent away from home. For too long, NE has not been recognised as a severe condition, because there was no specific education at medical school and a poor involvement by the practitioners.

      "abstract": "Hepatic encephalopathy is a toxic delirium and may be chronic or acute in onset, and it may vary in severity along a spectrum. Subclinical hepatic encephalopathy may manifest only on neuropsychological testing, with minimal slowing of mental processes and mild cognitive impairment. Moderately severe hepatic encephalopathy is associated with lethargy, apathy, and subtle changes in personality. This chapter presents the possible mental signs and symptoms, possible physical signs and symptoms, and clinical course and prognosis. It also describes the case of a 69-year-old patient who displayed the symptoms of chronic hepatic encephalopathy along with an unusual, delusional misidentification syndrome. When very mild hepatic encephalopathy is suspected, neuropsychological testing maybe extremely useful. Patients who are at risk for hepatic encephalopathy include: those with hepatitis (especially hepatitis C), individuals who have abused alcohol, have malignancies spread to the liver, toxic exposure, toxic drug reactions, or chronic liver disease of any other kind (Wilson's disease).",

      "abstract": "Grahani, organ located between Amashaya and Pakwashaya,is an essential part of the digestive system, or Mahasrotas.This is a place of Agni, which supports and strengthens the metabolism and digestion of body. According to ancient Ayurvedic principles, Grahani controls intake, retention, digestion, absorption, and elimination of food. Vitiation in digestion can disrupt these activities, leading to the origin of Grahani dosha. In modern times, unhealthy lifestyles, irregular food intake, and excessive consumption of junk food have led to Grahani-related disorders and mental stress also, affecting digestion and absorption of food. Samhitas suggest that symptoms are mainly seen in Grahani dosha. Mandagni can lead to Grahanidosha, a condition caused by a chronic imbalance of PachakaPitta, Saman Vayu, and Kledaka Kapha. Symptoms include alternate bowel movements, stomach pain, foul-smelling stool, and mucus in feces. In modern science, above symptoms can be correlated with IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome). In IBS, the intestinal wall becomes sensitive to even small stimuli, resulting in excessive cramping in the abdomen and changes in the bowel movement and indigestion. In India, approximately 15% of adults suffer with IBS. The pathophysiology of GrahaniRoga, a disorder associated with compromised digestive function, is covered in this study along with a number of treatment options. such as, including herbs, Yoga, and lifestyle modifications.",

      "title": "G481(P) Prolonged sedation of an adolescent with intellectual disability: a multidisciplinary journey",
      "abstract": "<h3>Background</h3> This challenging case required balancing the best interests of an adolescent with severe rumination (with functional gut motility issues), severe intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder against invasive interventions to provide nutrition and hydration. <h3>Case presentation</h3> Severe rumination resulted in significant weight loss, putting this young person at high risk of harm. Relevant investigations revealed no organic cause for rumination, but he could not tolerate even small amounts of oral fluid. He wanted to eat and drink but would vomit immediately afterwards, despite behaviour interventions from play specialists, intellectual disability nurses and paediatric nurses. He was unable to tolerate intravenous cannulas or nasogastric tubes (NGT) due to sensory processing difficulties. Despite reinsertions under general anaesthesia, he would remove them as soon as he woke up. Due to potential metabolic risks, he was transferred to intensive care (PICU) to be managed under sedation for a period of time. Low dose antipsychotic medication was started, to manage procedure-related agitation that worsened rumination. He learnt to tolerate the NGT upon gradual weaning of sedation. The severity of rumination improved and his weight stabilised. He was transferred back to his local hospital on a weaning sedation plan. However, rumination recurred with discontinuation of his medications. He was readmitted to PICU and rumination was re-stabilised under IV sedation. Following multidisciplinary team discussion (involving liaison psychiatry, general paediatrics, intensive care, gastroenterology and surgery) a gastrostomy was placed to break the cycle. Eight weeks on parenteral nutrition and gastrostomy feeds gave his upper gastrointestinal tract time to recover. He is currently feeding orally with minimal rumination. The gastrostomy is being used for medications and fluids. He has returned to his premorbid level of functioning, and his weight is stable. <h3>Conclusion</h3> Gastrostomies have been used in children with intellectual disability and 'avoidant and restrictive food intake disorder' linked to autism. This case, however, presented additional challenges due to the severity of rumination with sensory processing difficulties, and tested the ethical limits of intensive care. Management in these cases must be multidisciplinary, with the adolescent's best interests at the centre of decision-making.",

      "title": "Leukodystrophy Overview – ARCHIVED CHAPTER, FOR HISTORICAL REFERENCE ONLY",
      "abstract": "NOTE: THIS PUBLICATION IS ARCHIVED. IT IS FOR HISTORICAL REFERENCE ONLY, AND THE INFORMATION MAY BE OUT OF DATE. Clinical characteristics Leukodystrophies are heritable myelin disorders affecting the white matter of the central nervous system with or without peripheral nervous system myelin involvement. Involvement of the white matter tracts almost universally leads to motor involvement that manifests as hypotonia in early childhood and progresses to spasticity over time. This may lead to variable motor impairment, from mild spastic diplegia to severe spastic quadriplegia that limits purposeful movement. In addition, motor dysfunction is likely to significantly impair vital functions including swallowing, chewing, and (in some cases) respiration. Other findings that vary by disorder include extrapyramidal movement disorders (e.g., dystonia and/or dyskinesias), ataxia, seizures, and delay in cognitive development or change in cognitive function over time. Diagnosis/testing Establishing the specific leukodystrophy present in a given individual usually involves: Genetic counseling Leukodystrophies with an identified genetic cause may be inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, an autosomal recessive manner, or an X-linked recessive manner. Genetic counseling regarding risk to family members depends on accurate diagnosis, determination of the mode of inheritance in each family, and results of molecular genetic testing. Prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk is possible for some types of leukodystrophy if the pathogenic variant(s) in the family are known. Many leukodystrophies are still without an identified genetic cause; once a genetic cause is identified, other inheritance patterns may emerge. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is symptomatic and ideally occurs in a multidisciplinary setting by specialists experienced in the care of persons with a leukodystrophy. Pharmacologic agents are used to manage muscle tone and block neuronal signaling to muscle (chemodenervation). Intensive physical therapy is used to improve mobility and function. Pharmacologic treatment of dystonia and dyskinesias may result in significant functional improvement. Treatment of ataxia, seizures, and cognitive issues is provided in the usual manner, depending on the needs of the individual. Prevention of primary manifestations: In a few leukodystrophies primary disease manifestations can be prevented by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or bone marrow transplantation (BMT) early in the disease course. Surveillance: Routine assessment of growth and nutritional status; physical examination and/or serial x-rays of the hips and spine to monitor for orthopedic complications; and routine history regarding signs and symptoms of seizures. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Mild head injuries and infection as these may exacerbate disease manifestations. Evaluation of relatives at risk: When primary prevention of a leukodystrophy is possible (e.g., by HSCT or BMT), it is appropriate to offer testing to asymptomatic at-risk relatives who would benefit from early diagnosis and consideration of early treatment.",

      "title": "Recurrent episodic vertigo secondary to hyponatremic encephalopathy from water intoxication.",
      "abstract": "Oral water intoxication is occasionally noted in infants, the elderly, psychotics, or even healthy adults. Patients with impaired free water excretion due to a systemic disease, or medications are also at risk for water intoxication. In some cases, hyponatremic encephalopathy can lead to neurologic morbidity and mortality. The signs and symptoms are primarily neurologic, including headache, anorexia, nausea, cramping, vomiting, personality changes, stupor, seizures, coma, respiratory arrest, and even death.1 The severity depends on the rapidity of onset and the extent of hyponatremia (serum sodium levels less than 130 mEq/L).2 However, frequent water intoxication related episodic vertigo is scarcely reported in the literature, and here we present such a case, and the subsequent treatment.\r\n\r\nOver a 4-year period (Table 1) an 80-year-old female presented to the emergency department 14 times with vertigo and hypo-osmolar hyponatremia due to water intoxication. The water intoxication developed after she developed xerostomia with associated polydipsia. She weighed 46.5 kg with a height of 152 cm, and a body mass index of 20.1 kg/m2. She had a 10 year history of type II diabetes mellitus, and hypertension for 10 years. Her medications included acarbose (Glucobay 50mg, Bayer Schering Pharma AG, Leverkusen, Germany), glimepiride (Amaryl 2mg, Handok Pharmaceuticals Co., Chungcheongbuk-do, Korea) and valsartan (Diovan 160mg, Novartis Farmaceutica S.A. Stein, Switzerland). She denied alcohol, cigarettes, coffee, or areca chewing. The vertigo with oscillopsia, nausea, and vomiting would develop after she consumed a pitcher of water (4 liters) in several hours. Changing position or head rotation increased the symptoms, and lying in supine position decreased the symptoms. Her vital signs, physical exam, mental status, and neurologic exam were always normal with the exception of a spontaneous leftward horizontal beating nystagmus. Electrocardiograms and blood chemistries were unremarkable with the exception of hyponatremia (Table 1). The vertigo always resolved following the correction of hyponatremia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 1\r\n\r\nSodium and osmolarity of each symptom attack in a patient with water related episodic vertigo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt presentation to the emergency department with her fourteenth symptomatic attack of water intoxication and vertigo, she did not have any somatosensory symptom. Judgment, orientation, memory, attention, and calculation were all intact. There was no headache, dysphonia, aphasia, dysarthria, dysphagia, blurred vision, diplopia, hypesthesia/thermanesthesia, dysmetria, hemiparesis, abasia, or astasia. Extraocular movements were intact. On straight ahead gaze, a spontaneous leftward horizontal beating nystagmus without a torsional component in the counter clockwise direction was observed, which was not suppressed by fixation and increased in leftward gaze in amplitude and frequency. Such a pure horizontal nystagmus is usually not found in a peripheral vestibular failure, and might indicate a central origin. After horizontal head shaking, the nystagmus was more pronounced. The clinical head-impulse test of the horizontal semicircular canals was pathological to the right but not the left. Testing horizontal and vertical saccades and smooth pursuit eye movements revealed no further deficits. The Romberg test showed a rightward deviation, the Fukuda stepping test could not be performed due to communication problems. She was able to ambulate with help, but had increased unsteadiness while ambulating with the eye closed. As in tandem gait, she had mild lateropulsion to the right side. There was no somatosensory or motor deficit. She did not have orthostatic hypotension. She did not submit to electronystagmogram or caloric test.\r\n\r\nAn MRI demonstrated brain atrophy instead of any old infarction on T1 and T2 images with fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and a hyperintense area in the right-sided upper medulla on the diffusion weighted image (DWI) (Figure 1). Time-of-flight magnetic resonance angiogram was unremarkable. Her serum sodium was 120 mmol/L with an osmolality of 249.1 mOSM/kg. Following treatment with a 100 mL 3% saline bolus intravenously over one hour, the vertigo and nystagmus subsided with serum sodium rechecked of 132 mmol/L, and an osmolality was 273.6 mOSM/kg. Following discharge, she was instructed to keep a water diary and to add a teaspoon of salt daily to a 600 ml bottle of sport drink. Over the following 2 years she was without further episodes of vertigo or water intoxication, but she eventually died of pneumonia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1\r\n\r\nDiffusion weighted MRI (repetition time/echo time/excitation: 9,212/144/1) demonstrated a hyperintense area in the right-sided upper medulla (filled arrow). The hyperintense area (dotted line circle) involved the right vestibular nucleus (v) and spinal ...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe presenting symptoms of hyponatremic encephalopathy are variable, including headache, nausea, vomiting, and lethargy. These symptoms can easily be overlooked as they occur in a variety of conditions. Also, the disease progression can be abrupt. Possible mechanisms for the symptoms of hyponatremic encephalopathy due to cytotoxic cerebral edema include: 1) diffuse brain parenchyma swelling compresses the supplying vessels and reduces cerebral blood flow, contributing to ischemia;3 2) an acute drop in serum sodium causes osmotic disequilibrium and a shift of water into brain cells despite the intact blood-brain barrier; 3) others include the energy failure of Na+/K+ ATPase pump, excessive increase of membrane ion permeability or excessive release of excitatory amino acids.4,5 A brain CT is not sensitive enough to detect mild cerebral cytotoxic edema of hyponatremic encephalopathy, which can be detected by DWI MRI.4,5 Her T1 weighted and T2 FLAIR MRI demonstrated brain atrophy rather than any old infarction, but DWI demonstrated a hyperintense area in the right-sided upper medulla (Figure 1).\r\n\r\nIn the present case, the patient suffered from 14 episodes of symptomatic hyponatremia over a 4 year period due to water intoxication to quell the thirst of xerostomia. She had no evidence of volume depletion or fluid overload and this appeared to be acute euvolemic hyponatremia (onset less than 48 hours) with an increase in total body water and no change in body sodium storage,1 and hence contributed to the hyponatremic encephalopathy of the right-sided upper medulla. As there was no old lacune left in her brain, the prior 13 vertigo episodes were not attributable to ischemia stroke; hence, cytotoxic brain edema was preferable to ischemia stroke in the fourteenth vertigo episode. According to her DWI MRI, the cytotoxic brain edema involved the right vestibular nucleus and spinal tract of the trigeminal nerve in the right-sided upper medulla (Figure 1). Although she did not have any ipsilateral trigeminal sensory defect, the impairment of the right vestibular nucleus contributed to 1) right vestibulopathy manifested as a pathologic head-impulse test during rightward head rotation, and 2) predominance of left vestibular function manifested as leftward horizontal beating gaze nystagmus, and rightward tilting Romberg test and tandem gait tests; furthermore, the leftward horizontal beating nystagmus could be aggravated by head shaking test.\r\n\r\nThe therapy for hyponatremic encephalopathy is the intravenous administration of 3% sodium chloride (513 mEq/L). Correction over 25 mEq/L in the first 24-48 hours would lead to cerebral osmotic demyelination, a safe correction of hyponatremia was suggested at 6-15 mEq/L in 24 hours or 20 mEq/L in 48 hours depending on the setting of hyponatremia; however, patients with acute symptomatic hyponatremia have a minimal risk of developing cerebral osmotic demyelization, and insufficient therapy rather than overcorrection has resulted in the majority of the associated morbidity.5 In the present case, the hyponatremia was corrected in a controlled setting in the emergency department. Following her final episode she was successfully managed by monitoring her fluid intake in conjunction with salt supplementation. She has been without further episodes of vertigo or water intoxication in the following 2 years before she died of pneumonia.\r\n\r\nRecurrent episodic vertigo might result from cervical origins, peripheral vertigo, vestibular migraine, vertebrobasilar artery insufficiency, intracranial hypotension, intracranial hypertension, or even drug side effects. Our patient was on regular acarbose, glimepiride, and valsartan for 10 years so side effects of these drugs were unlikely to be the cause of the symptoms of vertigo that began in the past 4 years.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, water intoxication with hyponatremic encephalopathy, although unusual, should be a differential diagnosis of recurrent episodic vertigo. The diagnosis depends on the high index of suspicion and immediate treatment is recommended to prevent further morbidity or mortality.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Eating disorders are often associated with neuropsychological traits of rigid and inflexible cognition and behavior. Cognitive flexibility refers to the ability to effectively adapt to changes in the environment and/or changing task demands by selectively altering one’s thoughts, responses and/or behaviors. It can be assessed using several different neurocognitive tasks, including those that measure set-shifting and task-switching. This chapter will summarize the state of the science of cognitive flexibility deficits in individuals with eating disorders. Cognitive flexibility deficits in neuropsychological tasks appear to be most pronounced among individuals with anorexia nervosa and may be less characteristic of other eating disorders. Implications for a discrepancy in findings between objective and subjective measures of cognitive flexibility are also provided, as well implications for therapeutic interventions.",

      "abstract": "Prevention of hypoglycemia is essential for preservation of brain metabolism and survival of the whole body. Normally, glucose is only substrate used by the brain to meet its metabolic requirements. When plasma glucose concentration decreases (e.g., during prolonged fasting or after administration of glucose-lowering drugs) several physiological responses are activated to prevent further decreases in blood glucose. The first response is known as counterregulation, a system that prevents and corrects hypoglycemia through the release of counterregulatory hormones. Ultimately traceable to neural glucose deprivation, symptoms of hypoglycemia include neurogenic (autonomic) and neuroglycopenic symptoms. Neurogenic symptoms (tremulousness, palpitations, anxiety, sweating, hunger, and paresthesias) are results of the perception of physiologic changes caused by the autonomic nervous system’s response to hypoglycemia. Neuroglycopenic symptoms (confusion, sensation of warmth, weakness or fatigue, severe cognitive failure, seizure, coma) are the results of brain glucose deprivation itself. Glycemic thresholds for symptoms of hypoglycemia shift to lower plasma glucose concentrations following recent episodes of hypoglycemia, leading to the syndrome of hypoglycemia unawareness-loss of warming symptoms of developing hypoglycemia. Thus, patients with recurrent hypoglycemia (e.g. those with tightly controlled diabetes or with an insulinoma) often tolerate abnormal low plasma glucose concentration without symptoms. Classification of symptoms of hypoglycemia, namely reactive versus fasting based on segregation by timing in relation to meals is no longer useful from a clinical point of view. Every patient with neuroglycopenic symptoms regardless of relation to food ingestion, requires comprehensive evaluation. Identification of the possible cause of hypoglycemia and selection of diagnostic modalities are facilitated by considering whether the patients appears to be healthy (with or without compensated coexistent disease) or ill (with a disease known to have a proclivity to develop hypoglycemia, or is hospitalized). Medications may mediate hypoglycemia in anybody, whether they appear healthy or ill. Optimal condition for confirming the presence and accurately diagnosing the type of hypoglycemic disorder occurs at the time of spontaneous spell. Otherwise, dynamic testing to generate conductive conditions should be conducted in any patients with a history of neuroglycopenic symptoms, regardless of relation to meal ingestion. Specific criteria regarding beta-cell polypeptide concentrations are required to establish hyperinsulinemia. Sulfonylureas in plasma should be measured with sensitive assays. Surgical management of insulinoma begins with simply considering the diagnosis then proceeding to establish absolutely the biochemical diagnosis.",

      "title": "Assessment of nocturia",
      "abstract": "Abstract Patients suffering from nocturia need a thorough medical and surgical history and a focused clinical examination. Baseline investigations required for patients suffering with nocturia include: height and weight to calculate the body mass index; bladder diary, e.g. the ICIQ-Bladder Diary; quality of life questionnaire, e.g. ICIQ-N and ICIQ-NQoL; urinalysis, e.g. ‘dipstick’; flow rate and post-void residual measurement; and biochemical tests, e.g. renal electrolytes. Further urological investigations, such as urodynamics, cystoscopy, or imaging, are not indicated, unless an abnormality is suspected on baseline investigations and after failure of conservative and medical therapy. Patients are usually referred to the urologist for nocturia. However, following a thorough investigation, patients may need to be referred to another specialty. For example, if there is 24-hour polyuria, then the patient should be referred to an endocrinologist; if they have sleep disorders, such sleep apnoea (snoring, respiratory arrests), nocturnal seizures, parasomnias (nocturnal motor and behavioural phenomena), or excessive daytime sleepiness (sleep episodes, imperative sleepiness), then they should be referred for sleep evaluation studies. Similarly, if there are psychological problems, then the patient will need to be referred to a psychologist or psychiatrist.",

Many individuals with SRED have coexisting sleep disorders that cause partial nighttime arousals. It is also common for patients with SREDs to have a co-incident daytime eating disorder, especially binge eating disorder and bulimia nervosa. Individuals with SRED may present with complaints of excessive daytime fatigue, multiple nighttime sleep disruptions, and/or weight gain. The onset of SRED is generally in adolescence or young adulthood but may be during childhood or midlife. Prognosis is dependent on identifying and effectively managing any coexisting primary sleep disorder and/or medical disorder. Medication for the treatment of SRED has led to considerable success. A variety of psychotropic medications are reported to precipitate SRED, especially zolpidem (Ambien).",

Initial treatment usually includes lifestyle interventions and behavioural modifications such as: reducing fluid intake at least 4 hours prior to bedtime, e.g. caffeine and/or alcohol, both of which are mild diuretics; limiting excessive food volume intake prior to bedtime, e.g. fruits, vegetables; in those with dependent oedema—adequate exercise, elevating the leg in the afternoon above the heart level, compression stockings; and emptying the bladder before going to bed. If conservative treatment fails to control the patient’s symptoms, then medical treatment is aimed at the primary cause of the nocturia. Combination therapy may be required in some cases. However, high-quality clinical trials looking at these combinations are lacking.",

Disorders of the nervous system affecting gastrointestinal tract function manifest primarily as abnormalities in motor (rather than secretory) functions. Common gastrointestinal symptoms in neurologic disorders include sialorrhea, dysphagia, gastroparesis, intestinal pseudo-obstruction, constipation, diarrhea, and fecal incontinence. Diseases of the entire neural axis ranging from the cerebral hemispheres to the peripheral autonomic nerves can result in gastrointestinal motility disorders. The most common neurologic diseases affecting gastrointestinal function are stroke, parkinsonism, multiple sclerosis, and diabetic neuropathy. Diagnosis involves identification of the neurologic disease and its distribution, and documentation of segmental gut dysfunction, typically using noninvasive imaging, transit measurements, or intraluminal measurements of pressure activity and coordination of motility. Apart from treatment of the underlying neurologic disease, management focuses on restoration of normal hydration and nutrition and pharmacologic treatment of the gut neuromuscular disorder.",

Deprescribing is recommended when there is loss of efficacy, major side effects, or use longer than four weeks. The withdrawal syndrome is due to physiologic dependence based on various receptor adaptations. Psychological, neurophysiologic, and somatic complaints can be misdiagnosed as psychiatric, psychosomatic, or substance use disorder. These symptoms may be severe and prolonged. The discontinuation process should include careful planning, support, and the use of cognitive behavioral therapy. Tapering, perhaps after substituting with a long-acting BzRA, should be patient-led and proceed slowly, anticipating completion over 12 to 18 months or even longer. In a proportion of patients, symptoms may continue months or years after complete BzRA cessation, requiring ongoing medical care.",

This condition is not always recognized by Western doctors, and Mexican Americans may seek the help of a curandero, or a sobador, a person who knows how to massage. A sobador may massage the abdomen or the back behind the stomach to dislodge the food that is stuck. Usually, family members know how to treat a condition like empacho, by either giving a laxative to clean out the stomach, giving an herb tea such as yerba buena (mint) or manzanilla (chamomile), or stroking the stomach with olive oil.",

      "abstract": "Introducción: En salud mental es frecuente observar comorbilidad entre trastornos mentales severos y trastornos por uso de sustancias. En estados donde destaca la desinhibición, como la manía en el Trastorno Bipolar, es posible que un paciente no consumidor realice consumos de sustancias adictivas que pueden influir en el curso de la enfermedad. En algunas ocasiones éste consumo puede limitarse únicamente al episodio, sin cristalizar en un trastorno adictivo o sin implicar una recaída. Bajo esta premisa presentamos el siguiente caso clínico. Descripción del Caso: Paciente mujer de 52 años con diagnóstico de Trastorno Esquizafectivo tipo Bipolar ingresada en Hospital de Día de Salud Mental de Mataró por episodio maníaco en remisión parcial. Durante el ingreso se objetiva un consumo de 3 paquetes diarios de tabaco en contexto de episodio maníaco, con abstinencia previa de 6 años de evolución. Una vez resuelto el cuadro la paciente detiene el consumo de forma brusca y sin craving objetivable. Pruebas complementarias: Se realiza analítica completa con hemograma, bioquímica, perfil hepatorenal, lipídico y tiroideo, vitamina B12 y folato sin alteraciones significativas. Tratamiento: Previamente la paciente había mantenido estabilidad con Palmitato de Paliperidona 150mg/mes en monoterapia. Durante el ingreso se añade Valproato sódico hasta 1000mg (valproemia 80.28) y Lormetazepam 1mg. Discusión: Las sustancias adictivas generan cambios neurológicos que predisponen al reinicio del consumo si se expone al paciente nuevamente al tóxico a pesar de haber mantenido una abstinencia prolongada. En este caso observamos como la paciente es capaz de detener el consumo de tabaco de forma abrupta y sin craving una vez resuelto el cuadro, a pesar de haber sido una consumidora importante en el pasado. Dada la gran prevalencia del tabaquismo en pacientes con patología mental grave, podría ser relevante conocer esta posibilidad para establecer un tratamiento más o menos enfocado a prevenir una recaída.",

That is, it is taken as part of a structural relationship with the other who offers food, with the desire at stake in this offer that the peoples receive, and with the enjoyment that it entails. One form is hysteric anorexia, which occurs in response to a certain difficulty that the subject encounters in the dialectic of the relationship with the desire of the other. Obesity frequently occurs since childhood, while anorexia and bulimia occur more at pubertal onset. The problem with obesity is that there is indeed a great silence around this syndrome. Clinical practice with the patients would then consist, in this perspective, of a treatment aimed at \"orthopedicising\" their disorder and restoring it to normal functioning, in the sense of a statistically given normality, such as the one on which the DSM is based.",

      "abstract": "Pre trial detention is a coercion measure where a suspect is incarcerated between the time he or she is being arrested until the trial. A pre trial detainee is considered innocent until proven guilty and thus it is important that the detention is not used as a punishment or rehabilitation. Whether a detainee is innocent or not he or she should be treated with respect for his or her human dignity. If there is a risk that a pre trial detainee will remove or effect evidence in the ongoing criminal investigation The court may allow the prosecutor to impose restrictions which limit the detainees contact with the outside world. Individual restrictions should be proportional to their means and used restrictively. \r\nExtensive use of such restrictions in combination with a long period of detention may lead to isolation of a detainee increasing the risk of anxiety, reduced cognitive abilities, sleeping difficulties and memory loss. Extended periods of isolation may even lead to serious mental illness such as personality changes and post traumatic stress disorder. Such isolation and its consequences has been compared to psychological torture. Another aspect of this matter is that a detainee who is experiencing mental illness may be disadvantaged when it comes to participating in interrogations, appearing in court or preparing his or her defence. \r\nThe Swedish pre trial detention system has been widely criticized due to an extensive use of restrictions, long detention times and the treatment of adolescents in custody. Nearly 50 % of all the detainees where subject to one or more types of restrictions and there are examples of detainees in Sweden that have been in pre trial detention with full restrictions up to three or four years. The European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT) and the United Nations Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (SPT) have visited Sweden eight times altogether since 1991. The purpose of the visits has been to evaluate the treatment of persons deprived of their liberty. The reports and recommendations following the visits have shown that there is a need for change for Sweden to better meet the mental health of detainees in pre trial detention.\r\nIn April 2015 the Swedish prosecutor general provided guidelines directed to Swedish prosecutors. The guidelines aim to change the procedure of imposing restrictions of detainees and to reduce the time they spend in pre trial detention. The subject of this thesis is the question of whether these guidelines will change the prevailing situation, or if they need to be supplemented by legislative measures. Among the proposals of what such legislative measures might look like are detailed regulation regarding the use of restrictions, established time limits for pre trial detention and isolation, and a procedure where the District Court Judge has a greater influence on the restrictions that are imposed. In my opinion, Swedish custody laws are in great need of change in order to make sure that the needs of the detainees and their mental health are respected.",

Mostly, that are not explained by an specifiable organic disease and that especially related to psychiatric underlying cause. Psychogenic gait disorders (PGDs) may be fluctuations during a physical exam-particularly an increase of movement following attention, and a decrease when the person is distracted. Useful clues suggesting psychogenic gait problems are acute onset, selective disability, false weakness, bizarre tremor, astasia-abasia (a lurching gait with repeated near falls). If one or more of these features were present, the diagnosis of psychogenic gait disturbance could be made on phenomenological grounds alone with over 90% certainty. But, as with other pseudoneurologic signs, normal underlying neurological function must be demonstrated. Here, we describe a 54-year-old case who had suffered from postural instability, unusual gait disturbance with excessive slowness for about 7 years before, following a stressful life event.",

The interviewer should make sure that any “yes” response is not simply caused by exposure to a certain situation or object (Specific Phobia), being the focus of attention (Social Anxiety Disorder/Social Phobia), being separated from parents (Separation Anxiety), and so on. If the child gives examples that are the result of another anxiety disorder, or elaboration of the response to Question 1b suggests that the child does not seem to understand Question 1a, then the interviewer may ask Question 1c to reassess presence of “unexpected” panic attacks. DSM-5 defines a panic attack as a discrete period of intense fear or discomfort, in which at least four of the symptoms listed develop abruptly and reach a peak within minutes of onset. To meet the criteria for Panic Disorder, the child must report recurrent, unexpected panic attacks, at least one of which has been followed for a month by one or more symptoms.",

Enuresis is a symptom believed to result from a variety of etiological factors, including genitourinary disease, neurological disturbances, delayed development, allergic reactions, deep sleep, and psychological factors. Although enuresis is frequently a self-limiting condition, every child presenting with this problem deserves a careful work-up and consideration of therapy based on the probable underlying cause. There are five major approaches to therapy of enuresis: psychological, psycho-physiological, medication (particularly imipramine HC1), conditioning therapy, and dietary restrictions. Effective therapy will often involve more than one approach and should be tailored on an individual basis to meet each child's particular needs.",

These symptoms are often associated with functional impairment and psychological distress among patients, and increase healthcare costs.2345 Observational studies in primary care report that women, especially those aged 35-45 years, more commonly present with these symptoms.25 Defining and categorising an unexplained symptom is tricky and disputed (see box 1).910 Sometimes symptoms fit criteria for somatoform or psychiatric disorders set out in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV (DSM IV)6 or functional somatic syndromes such as irritable bowel syndrome. In other cases there is no label to offer the patient. #### Box 1: Terminology used in this article",

      "title": "Developing family resilience in chronic psychiatric illnesses.",
      "abstract": "Caregiving for an ill family member can be both stressful and rewarding. Caring for a relative with a psychiatric illness adds the burden of social stigma, both for the patient and the family caregivers, especially in minority cultures. Families from minority cultures may have a different understanding of mental illness and have difficulties with language, discrimination, and accessing services. The appraisal of caregiving must be assessed separately from a caregiver’s coping style. For example, caregiving may be perceived as low stress but the caregiver’s coping skills may be poor, resulting in high caregiver burden. Low perceived stress with strong coping skills results in the most reward and the least burden. High levels of caregiver burden occur in caregivers of relatives with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and chronic or recurrent mood disorders. Caregiver burden tends to be worse and more persistent with relatives who suffer from depressive disorders compared to bipolar disorder. Children of caregivers may have difficult behavior, loss of appetite, sleeplessness, with less playing and less attention at school. Caregiver burden can be reduced and caregiver reward can be maximized by improving family resilience. The concept of family resilience explains why some families experience lower burden and greater reward. Family resilience includes the ability to develop adaptive interpersonal skills, such as differentiating the person from the illness, and positive family qualities, such as mutual acceptance and empathic involvement. These family strengths contribute to a sense of family wellnbeing and offset difficulties in other areas of family functioning. The wellbeing of the family unit ensures the best outcome for both patient and caregiver.",

Furthermore, psychiatric symptoms (PSs) in neurological disorders (NDs) among primary health care physicians and other specialties are often neglected. Anxiety and depression are most common, but hallucinations, delusions, obsessive-compulsive disorder and delirium or confusional state are also frequent comorbidity in many neurological conditions such as stroke, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson disease (PD). Depression and NDs also have a bidirectional relationship, as not only are patients, for example with stroke at greater risk of developing depression, but patients with depression have a two-fold greater risk of developing a stroke, even after controlling for other risk factors. Dementia or cognitive impairment are part of clinical picture of PD, stroke patients, patients with MS, Huntington disease etc. The prototype of dementia in PD and other NDs is a dysexecutive syndrome with impaired attention, executive functions and secondarily impaired memory. So-called \"functional\" (or psychogenic or hysterical/conversion) symptoms are relatively infrequent in \"neurological\" conditions, but very often unrecognized and not properly treated. Treatment of PSs in neurology, basically are not different then treatment of these symptoms in psychiatry and should be include pharmacotherapy and psychiatry. This presentation gives an overview of frequency and type of PSs underlying necessity to recognize these disorders in every day routine exam and properly treatment.",

According to the recent reports, 1 out of every 58 newly-born children is suffering from autism. The aetiology of the disorder is complex and poorly understood, hindering the adaptation of targeted and effective therapies. There are no well- established diagnostic biomarkers for autism. Hence the analysis of symptoms by the pediatricians plays a critical role in the early intervention.In the present report, we have emphasized 24 behavioral, psychological and clinical symptoms of autism.Impaired social interaction, restrictive and narrow interests, anxiety, depression; aggressive, repetitive, rigid and self-injurious behavior, lack of consistency, short attention span, fear, shyness and phobias, hypersensitivity and rapid mood alterations, high level of food and toy selectivity; inability to establish friendships or follow the instructions; fascination by round spinning objects and eating non-food materials are common psychological characteristics of autism. Speech or hearing impairments, poor cognitive function, gastrointestinal problems, weak immunity, disturbed sleep and circadian rhythms, weak motor neuromuscular interaction, lower level of serotonin and neurotransmitters, headache and body pain are common physiological symptoms.A variable qualitative and quantitative impact of this wide range of symptoms is perceived in each autistic individual, making him/her distinct, incomparable and exceptional. Selection and application of highly personalized medical and psychological therapies are therefore recommended for the management and treatment of autism.",

These abnormal events or experiences are not principally abnormalities of the states of sleep and wakefulness, and they are not generally associated with major complaints of excessive sleepiness or insomnia. Parasomnias can manifest as activation of skeletal muscles or the autonomic nervous system during sleep. They usually occur intermittently or episodically either within sleep or during its transition to and from wakefulness. Occasionally, parasomnias may give rise to violent and potentially injurious behavior. Parasomnias can be classified into three groups based on the American Academy of Sleep Medicine International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD; second edition; see References) (Box 7–1). 1. Disorders of arousal from non–rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, including confusional arousals, sleepwalking, and sleep terrors 2. Parasomnias usually associated with rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, including REM sleep behavior disorder (including parasomnia overlap disorder and status dissociatus), recurrent isolated sleep paralysis, and nightmare disorder 3.

      "abstract": "<italic>Life’s Rewards: Linking Dopamine, Incentive Learning, Schizophrenia, and the Mind</italic> explains how increased brain dopamine produces reward-related incentive learning, the acquisition by neutral stimuli of increased ability to elicit approach and other responses. Dopamine decreases may produce inverse incentive learning, the loss by stimuli of the ability to elicit approach and other responses. Incentive learning is gradually lost when dopamine receptors are blocked. The brain has multiple memory systems defined as “declarative” and “non-declarative;” incentive learning produces one form of non-declarative memory. People with schizophrenia have hyperdopaminergia, possibly producing excessive incentive learning. Delusions may rely on declarative memory to interpret the world as it appears with excessive incentive learning. Parkinson’s disease, associated with dopamine loss, may involve a loss of incentive learning and increased inverse incentive learning. Drugs of abuse activate dopaminergic neurotransmission, leading to incentive learning about drug-associated stimuli. After withdrawal symptoms have been alleviated by detoxification treatment, drug-associated conditioned incentive stimuli will retain their ability to elicit responses until they are repeatedly experienced in the absence of primary drug rewards. Incentive learning may involve the action of dopamine at dendritic spines of striatal medium spiny neurons that have recently had glutamatergic input from assemblies of cortical neurons activated by environmental and proprioceptive stimuli. Glutamate initiates a wave of phosphorylation normally followed by a wave of phosphatase activity. If dopaminergic neurons fire, stimulation of D1 receptors prolongs the wave of phosphorylation, allowing glutamate synaptic strengthening. Activity in dopaminergic neurons in humans appears to affect mental experience.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is deﬁned as difﬁculty with the initiation, maintenance, duration, or quality of sleep resulting in the impairment of daytime functioning despite adequate opportunity and circumstances for sleep (1,2). Although research studies sometimes require a speciﬁc quantitative deﬁnition, a patient’s subjective judgment that sleep is insufﬁcient, inadequate, or nonrestorative is the most important factor in clinical practice. Insomnia is the most common sleep complaint. Transient insomnia lasts less than one week, and short-term insomnia one to four weeks. Chronic insomnia, insomnia lasting more than one month, affects between 10% and 35% of the population in the western world (3,4). The number of chronic insomniacs rises with age, and women of all ages complain of insomnia more often thanmen (3,5). Insomnia is frequently associatedwith othermedical complaints and psychological symptoms, particularly anxiety, worry, and depression. Stressful life events (difﬁculties in interpersonal relationships, family discord, problems at work, and ﬁnancial troubles) may also generate a nonrestorative sleep complaint. Insomnia is not a speciﬁc illness or disease, but rather a symptom or consequence of other primary disorders. “Poor quality of sleep” is a common complaint in the family members of chronic insomniacs. However, it is difﬁcult to gauge the extent to which the emotional problems favouring the onset of a sleep disorder in adulthood are due to a genetic predisposition or the result of having lived in a family burdened by affective problems and/or interpersonal conﬂicts.",

      "title": "Peripheral opioid antagonism",
      "abstract": "Opioid induced bowel dysfunction may be associated with constipation, incomplete evacuation, bloating sensation and increased reflux of stomach contents. It may be unpredictable in onset, develop immediately after the first dose, persist throughout the analgesic period and, unlike the analgesia, exhibit lack of tolerance. This may follow both acute or chronic opioid intake. Acutely, it usually manifests as a part of a postoperative ileus that itself may be attributed to surgical stress, or to alterations in fluid and electrolyte balance [1]. In patients with chronic usage of opioids, the bowel dysfunction may manifest as a range of symptoms with more than half of patients experiencing constipation. While analgesia is predominantly attributed to centrally mediated opioid actions, these unwanted gastrointestinal side effects may be more peripherally related and have been associated with the enteric μ receptors [2]. This has led to the development of peripherally antagonist opioid drugs, two of which (methylnaltrexone and alvimopan) have been recently approved by the FDA (although not available in the UK yet) and release of a fixed-dose opioid agonist-antagonist combination (oxycodone and naloxone) in the UK and Europe. Methylnaltrexone (Fig. 1) is a charged, quarternary amine, a N-methyl derivative of the opioid antagonist naltrexone. Addition of the methyl group confers polarity to the molecule and reduces the lipid solubility, hence reducing its passage across the blood-brain barrier [3]. Methylnaltrexone has a high affinity to the μ receptor (IC50 = 70 nmol.l−1) with some affinity to the κ receptor (IC50 = 575 nmol.l−1) and virtually no affinity to the δ receptor [3]. Methylnaltrexone is approved by the European Medicines Agency for clinical use and is administered subcutaneously in a dose of 0.15 mg.kg−1 (12 mg.0.6 ml−1 solution in a single vial) for treatment of opioid induced constipation in patients with advanced illness when response to laxative therapy has not been sufficient. Methylnaltrexone. Clinically it has demonstrated a reduction in gastrointestinal time (93–110 min vs 140–163 min for placebo; 95% CI −73 to −32 min) [4]. It might be particularly beneficial for inpatients (both in postoperative and medical wards), many of whom are on long-term opioid therapy. These patients usually experience a good analgesic effect and response to opioids but have a poor compliance due to opioid induced bowel dysfunction. Methylnaltrexone has been used safely in patients on long-term methadone programmes administered both intravenously [5] and orally [6]. While it decreased oral-caecal transit time, no opioid withdrawal symptoms were reported in any of the groups. The side effects are predominantly associated with gut overactivity and may manifest as abdominal cramps and flatulence, although dose limiting orthostatic hypotension at high plasma concentrations (> 1400 ng.ml-1) has also been reported [4]. Alvimopan (Fig. 2) is a synthetic high molecular weight quarternary zwitterion (a molecule with both positive and negative regions of charge) that is a highly potent competitive antagonist at the human μ receptor. In contrast to methylnaltrexone, alvimopan has a higher affinity to the μ receptor and owes its action to its kinetics with a relatively slow dissociation from the receptors. Its oral bioavailability is only 6%, restricting its activity predominantly to the gut where it gets metabolised [7]. Although the molecule has been investigated for its efficacy in both opioid induced constipation and acute postoperative ileus, the focus in development has been primarily towards the latter. In patients who developed postoperative ileus after undergoing bowel resection and hysterectomy (Cochrane data, n = 2225) [4], alvimopan administration reduced the time to first bowel movement or flatus, or total time to pass flatus when compared with placebo [8–12]. Patients in the alvimopan group also showed a reduced requirement for postoperative X-ray and nasogastric tube insertion compared with placebo [4]. However, its use is currently limited to acute administration since, although alvimopan has demonstrated a reduction in time to first bowel movement and changes in spontaneous bowel movement frequency in patients on methadone programmes with opioid induced constipation, long-term efficacy studies have found an association between treatment with alvimopman and an increased risk of cardiovascular events (n = 7 (1.3%) vs n = 0) [13]. As these events were reported within the first 12 weeks of treatment, they may not be ultimately related to long-term duration of the dose, but there remains a need for concrete evidence with regards to the safety of the drug for its long-term usage. Alvimopan is licensed to prevent postoperative ileus in patients with a partial large or small bowel resection with primary anastomosis, and only approved for short-term use of no more than 15 doses. It is available as gelatin capsule, administered orally as 12 mg, 30 min to 5 h pre-operatively and 12 mg twice daily for 7 days postoperatively. Alvimopan. In contrast to the newer drugs, methylnaltrexone and alvimopan, naloxone (Fig. 3) is a non-specific opioid antagonist that has been commonly used intravenously to reverse opioid related effects for years. Structurally a tertiary amine, it is the N-alkyl derivative of oxymorphine with substitution of the allyl group for the methyl group conferring its antagonist properties. It has a high affinity for the μ receptor and a lesser affinity for κ and δ receptors. It can cross the blood-brain barrier and is well absorbed following oral administration, where it undergoes hepatic metabolism with a low oral bioavailability of < 2% [14] This poor oral bioavailability limits any beneficial effects when administered orally in standard preparation and dosages. In theory, orally administered high doses of naloxone should be devoid of ‘central’ CNS-type effects while exerting an inhibitor effect on the ‘peripheral’ gastrointestinal system at the myenteric plexus in the gut, where μ receptors are primarily located. Oral naloxone has been studied for some time with regards to its CNS sparing action for some time and the results have been equivocal. Liu et al., [15] successfully demonstrated that naloxone administration improved bowel frequency in patients on long-term morphine and oxycodone for malignant and non-malignant pain, with patients in the naloxone group also needing more analgesia. The study was, however, inadequately powered (n = 9) to draw firm conclusions. In contrast, in a placebo controlled study of patients undergoing subtotal gastrectomy (n = 43), naloxone administered epidurally alongside morphine improved constipation (p < 0.001) while there were no reported differences in pain scores between the two groups [16]. In patients who have received mechanical ventilation in the ICU on sedation/analgesia, naloxone administration via the nasogastric tube reduced both gastric reflux and pneumonia without reversing analgesia or triggering any increase in opioid requirement [17, 18]. A Cochrane review investigating the efficacy of naloxone on its own for opioid induced constipation failed to draw any positive conclusions due the variability of data and poor design of some of the studies [4]. One of the reasons may be that it is immediate release oral naloxone that has been primarily investigated in these studies; this might not outlast the longer acting opioid when used chronically. Naloxone. A new development has been the preparation of a fixed-dose of the oral prolonged-release opioid agonist, oxycodone, and prolonged-release naloxone, focussing mainly on opioid induced constipation. A placebo controlled, double-blind study, investigating the efficacy of oral prolonged-release naloxone in patients with mainly non-malignant chronic pain (n = 202) on stable prolonged-release oxycodone, reported an improvement in bowel function [19]. No loss of analgesic efficacy with naloxone was observed. In another phase-III, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy study in patients with chronic non-malignant back pain (n = 463), a fixed-dose combination of prolonged-release oxycodone and prolonged-release naloxone demonstrated a superior analgesic efficacy over placebo (p < 0.001) [20]. In this study, a subset analysis of 59 patients with a higher bowel function index, (a patient-reported quantitative measure of constipation) reported a decrease in scores (improving constipation) over a period of 12 weeks. A comparative study of oral prolonged-release oxycodone vs a combination of oral prolonged-release oxycodone and naloxone, in patients with moderate to severe non-malignant pain, reported a similar improvement in bowel function without reducing analgesic efficacy [21]. Available for use in Europe since 2006 and now available in UK in a fixed-dose preparation of prolonged-release oxycodone hydrochloride/naloxone combination (10 mg/5 mg and 20 mg/10 mg), it is currently licensed for treatment of severe pain that can only be managed with opioid analgesics. Managing opioid induced gastrointestinal side effects has always been a challenge. Development of the two new, exciting, peripherally acting μ receptor antagonists, methylnaltrexone and alvimopan, holds promise–especially in the acute peri-operative situation, while the unique fixed-dose combination of prolonged-release oxycodone and prolonged-release naloxone might confer therapeutic advantage in patients on chronic opioid therapy, where constipation remains the most common side effect of long-term opioid administration.",

      "abstract": "WSAS Work and Social Adjustment ScaleChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is, according to the CDC-1994 criteria, a disorder characterized by unexplained, persistent or relapsing fatigue of a new or definite onset, which is present for at least six months.The fatigue is not the result of exertion, is not alleviated by rest and leads to a significant reduction in previous levels of occupational, educational, social and personal activities.In addition, the fatigue has to be accompanied by at least four of the following symptoms, which have to be present for at least six months: impaired short-term memory or concentration, sore throat, tender cervical or axillary lymph nodes, muscles pain, pain in several joints, headache of a new type, pattern or severity, unrefreshing sleep or post-exertional malaise lasting more than 24 hours [6].Besides the CDC-1994 criteria [6], over 20 other case definitions have been developed with differences in main symptoms, inclusion and exclusion criteria [14,15].Consequently, these case definitions vary in sensitivity and specificity, but consensus on a uniform case definition has not been reached.Since the CDC-1994 case definition is the most frequently cited and most extensively validated [14], this case definition will be used throughout this thesis to define CFS.Estimates of prevalence rates vary in relation to case definitions and study designs [16,17], and range between 0.2% -2.2% for developed countries [16][17][18].The total prevalence of CFS in Europe is estimated around 2 million [19].CFS is 1.5 to 2 times more prevalent in women than men [16,17] and is most common in young adults with its peak at 20-40 years of age [16].Information on incidence rates is even more scarce and is estimated at 15/100.000adults per year in de United Kingdom [18].Limited attention has been given to the societal impact of CFS in Europe [19], but a significant economic burden has been identified due to both direct as indirect or hidden costs.Direct costs encompass mainly various medical costs, and indirect costs consist of occupational limitations (productivity loss, absenteeism, work incapacity) and nonmedical, often hidden costs such as informal care given by the patient's social context CFS can be considered a non-specific disorder characterized by chronic fatigue that may be accompanied by chronic pain.The aetiology of MO is clear and, consequently, MO can be classified as a specific disorder explaining the localized (nociceptive) pain due to the structural deformities.However, as with many chronic disorders, the pathophysiology of chronic fatigue and chronic pain remains not fully understood.The pathophysiology of chronic fatigue and chronic pain complaints is hypothesized to be multifactorial and can differ depending on the underlying disease [42][43][44].This thesis is particularly interested in the impact of chronic fatigue in patients who also experience chronic pain.environmental and personal factors can either be facilitating or restricting [49].As presented by the ICF (Figure 1), all concepts are inseparable and insight into the association between all concepts is necessary to clarify the impact of CFS and MO (health condition) on a person's physical activity level (PAL), activities, participation and HRQOL. Outline of this thesisPart 1: Assessment of (physical) limitations and restrictions in chronic fatigue syndrome In order to explore HRQOL and physical activity in patients with chronic fatigue, the first aim of the present thesis is to identify reliable and valid measurement instruments for measuring these constructs.A large number of measurement instruments for measuring HRQOL and physical activity are available.Even though research regarding HRQOL and physical activity has been performed in patients with chronic fatigue, and more specifically patients with CFS, consensus on the psychometric characteristics of these measurement instruments in patients with CFS is lacking.Consequently, it is unclear which measurement instruments are most suited to use in research, but also in clinical practice.In patients with MO, insufficient research regarding patients' HRQOL and no research on their PAL has been performed.The investigation and selection of appropriate and suitable measurement instruments was based on previous research results in patients with CFS, since the primary diagnostic criterium in CFS is chronic fatigue; this group is therefore a valid representation of patients with chronic fatigue.A systematic review of the literature and critical appraisal of the psychometric properties of identified measurement instruments measuring HRQOL and physical activity in patients with CFS was deemed necessary as a starting point to address the overall aim of the present thesis.The results of the systematic review on measurement instruments to assess activity limitations and participation restrictions in patients with CFS are described in chapter 2. The results of the systematic review on the psychometric assessment of measurement instruments to evaluate the physical activity level and pattern in patients with CFS are described in chapter 3.Both objective measures and self-report measures are often used to assess a person's PAL.Objective measures fairly accurately estimate patients' actual PAL in terms of activity intensity, but most currently used measures do not take environmental and contextual factors into account and they do not provide a detailed overview of the kind of activities patients perform.This information would provide more insight in patients' meaningful activities of daily living and would help to tailor activity management programs to each patient's individual needs.Self-report measures could provide this information, but previous studies have shown that current self-report measures are not capable of measuring patients' actual PAL [79][80][81].Therefore, a measurement instrument (activity diary) that addresses the limitations of previously used self-report measures was developed and it was investigated whether the activity diary could accurately estimate patients' actual PAL by comparing it to an objective measure.Chapter 4 evaluates the ability of the activity diary to estimate the actual PAL in patients with CFS and explores which factors explain the discrepancy between the objective and self-report measure of physical activity.

      "abstract": "Abstract Functional dyspepsia (FD) is characterized by upper gastrointestinal symptoms, which are frequently exacerbated by meal ingestion. While subgroups of FD patients exhibit a range of disturbances in upper gastrointestinal motor function, including delayed gastric emptying and abnormal intragastric meal distribution, which may reflect impaired proximal gastric relaxation and/or antral dysmotility, the association between symptoms and abnormalities in motor function appears to be relatively weak. More recently, the concept of visceral hypersensitivity to mechanical and chemical/nutrient stimuli has been promoted as important in the aetiology of dyspeptic symptoms. Somewhat surprisingly, the role of ‘dietary’ factors, that is, those factors, related directly to food ingestion, including patterns of nutrient intake, potential intolerance to specific foods or macronutrients, as well as cognitive factors, have been largely ignored. Moreover, presently available treatments fail to take into account the fact that symptoms are frequently induced by eating. This review focuses on the relevance of ‘dietary’ factors to FD.",

A kid with Cerebral palsy (CP) has trouble controlling the muscles of the body (hall mark of the condition is motor dysfunction, i.e. there is abnormal muscle tone, abnormal posture and movement) [1,2]. Normally, the brain tells the rest of the body exactly what to do and when to do it. But because CP affects the brain, depending on what part of the brain is affected, a kid might not be able to walk, talk, eat or play the way most kids do. It is a non-progressive but often changing motor impairment syndromes. It is usually secondary to an insult of limited duration or anomalies of the brain arising in the early stages of development.

      "abstract": "The clinical approach to evaluation and management of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) or premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) involves taking an accurate history, prospective daily symptom monitoring to establish the diagnosis, patient-specific initial medical or psychological therapy, and adequate follow-up with appropriate alterations in the treatment plan. A typical patient can present with premenstrual irritability, mood swings, anxiety and/or depression, and physical symptoms that may include breast tenderness, bloating, fatigue, appetite, and sleep alterations, or difficulty concentrating; these conditions result in significant overall interference with daily activities or social interactions. As the symptoms are not unique in their nature but only in their timing, the diagnosis should be made only after the patient completes daily recording of bothersome symptoms for 2-3 consecutive months. However, a detailed psychiatric interview by an appropriately trained professional may rule out underlying affective disorder. This may be a useful compromise when only retrospective information is available.1 Various medical and affective disorders included in the differential diagnosis must be excluded. Current management strategies include education and self-care, calcium supplementation, and the choice of a number of psychotropic agents that augment serotonin, administered either throughout the cycle or during the luteal phase alone. Pharmacological options include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), serotonergic tricyclic antidepressants, or hormonal approaches that prevent ovulation, such as some oral contraceptives, gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRH agonists), danazol, and highdose estrogen. Psychological approaches, including cognitive/behavioral and relaxation therapy, may alsobe effective. The treatment plan should be designed according to the patient's specific symptoms, past pharmacological treatment experiences, and other current and past health and contraceptive needs.",

These disorders have not been officially recognized so that they are not classified as independent entities. The term orthorexia comes from the Greek word orthos (straight, proper) and orexia (appetite). It is characterized by the pathological obsession for biologically pure food, which leads to important dietary restrictions. Orthorexic patients exclude foods from their diets that they consider to be impure because they have herbicides, pesticides or artificial substances and they worry in excess about the techniques and materials used in the food elaboration. This obsession leads to loss of social relationships and affective dissatisfactions which, in turn, favors obsessive concern about food. In orthorexia, that patient initially wants to improve his/her health, treat a disease or lose weight. Finally, the diet becomes the most important part of their lives. We present a clinical case that responds to the characteristics of orthorexia. The differential diagnosis with chronic delusional disorder, anorexia nervosa and obsessive-compulsive disorder is carried out.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Psychological factors are widely held to be important for the orderly function of the gastrointestinal tract as well as for the development and course of disorders affecting the gut. Evidence supporting these assumptions is scarce, although it has become clear that intestinal functions are influenced by the state of central nervous activation, i.e. by satiation, relaxation and sleep as well as hunger, tension and rage. Freud assumed that the accumulation of an unabreacted quota of affect induced defence or repression and a conversion of emotion into bodily symptoms. Subsequently, disorders such as globus sensation, diffuse oesophageal spasm and ‘cardiospasm’ were viewed as conversion symptoms. Other concepts claimed an aetiological role of specific conflicts, certain affective states and ‘inappropriate perpetuations of organ reactions adaptive to, or protective against, some stress in human life’. However, these and other psychosomatic concepts could not be verified. Conversely, an illness exacerbation may precipitate a disruption in a patient's adjustment to his/her environment and interfere with his/her ability to fight the disease. Psychotherapeutic interventions may help patients to cope with their illness and its consequences and possibly alter the course of disease. Psychosocial factors may determine a patient's reactions to, and handling of, a disease and thus should not escape the physician's attention.",

Hence, the proportion of cancer patients meeting diagnostic criteria for the insomnia syndrome is not well known. Recently the diagnosis of the insomnia syndrome has been redefined using a combination of criteria derived from the International Classification of Sleep Disorders and the DSM-IV. The criteria includes)difficulty in initiating and/or maintaining sleep, whereby sleep-onset latency and/or wake after sleep onset is greater than 30 minutes; sleep efficiency (ratio of total sleep time to total time spent in bed) lower than 85%; difficulties occurring at least 3 nights per week; difficulties occurring for at least 6 months; and difficulties causing marked distress or significant impairment in daytime functioning (eg, fatigue, disturbed mood, performance deficits). Methods: 100 consecutive oncology patients were surveyed using the above criteria for the insomnia syndrome. Symptom assessment was also included. Results: The incidence of the insomnia syndrome seems to correspond to previously reported incidences.Patient have more problems staying asleep than going to sleep. Patients may have dramatic inversions of their sleep/wake cycle yet feel that they do not have insomnia. Pain is the most commonly associated symptom associated with insomnia. Conclusions: There is a great need for better tools to asssess the symptom of insomnia. Focusing on specific characteristics of insomnia and distinguishing the insomnia syndrome versus the symptom of insomnia is an effective way establish if there is a need for specific therapy. The addition of symptom assessment further improves the characterisation insomnia. Characteristics of insomnia experienced by the patient may help direct specific treatment modalities. Pain is a frequently associated symptom with insomnia. No significant financial relationships to disclose.",

      "title": "Reducing eating disorders through experiential psychotherapy: a case study of anorexia nervosa",
      "abstract": "Over the last decades, the prevalence of eating disorders has increased dramatically. In the current psychiatric nomenclature of the DSM-5 [2], the eating disorders consist of three clearly defined syndromes, i.e. anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervos and binge-eating disorder. The onset of the most clinical cases occurs in adolescence or young adulthood. Data provided by psychiatric practice reveal that eating disorders occur more frequently in women, compared with men. These disorders appear to be multidetermined. Thus, the risk for (or protection against) the development of eating disorders resides in several factors, i.e. genetic, neurohormonal, family, psychological and sociocultural. Negative life events can also play a triggering role. Anorexia nervosa is a debilitating mental disorder with profound biological, psychological and social consequences. Although the overall incidence rate of anorexia nervosa is considerably stable over the past decades, the incidence among adolescents has increased. Different types of psychotherapeutic interventions (e.g., family-based therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy, dialectical behavior therapy, interpersonal therapy, etc.) are used to treat eating disorders. However, the benefits of experiential techniques (e.g., emotion-focused therapy or gestalt therapy) have been less explored. This paper focuses on a 19-yearold adolescent girl presenting with symptoms of anorexia nervosa. The complaints, results of the initial assessment, goals of the therapeutic sessions, working techniques as well as gains of the intervention based on experiential methods (e.g., the empty chair technique, metapositions, cognitive reframing, etc.) are reviewed. Practical implications are discussed considering the potential of experiential psychotherapy in assisting clients with eating disorders.",

      "abstract": "In contrast to other mental health disorders, eating disorders have a high prevalence of concomitant medical complications. Specifically, patients suffering from anorexia nervosa (AN) have a litany of medical complications which are commonly present as part of their eating disorders. Almost every body system can be adversely, affected by this state of progressive malnutrition. Moreover, some of the complications can have permanent adverse effects even after there is a successful program of nutritional rehabilitation and weight restoration. Within this article we will review all body systems affected by AN. There is also salient information about both, how to diagnose these medical complications and which are the likely ones to result in permanent sequelae if not diagnosed and addressed early in the course of AN. In a subsequent article, the definitive medical treatment for these complications will be presented in a clinically practical manner.",

      "abstract": "Almost all functions of the gastrointestinal tract have been shown to be under central nervous control and to respond to environmental factors such as stress. It is, therefore, not surprising that disturbed gastrointestinal functions may be altered through psychological therapy approaches. For motor dysfunctions of the esophagus and functional dyspepsia, there is a lack of behavioral therapy studies, while controlled studies utilizing relaxation techniques, stress management strategies and anxiety treatment have been shown to improve symptoms and prevent recurrence in reflux esophagitis and peptic ulcer disease despite the wide use of effective medication. Most studies have treated patients with symptoms of the irritable bowel syndrome: This approach usually combined conventional medical treatment with psychotherapy. Psychological management usually consisted of relaxation training, stress management and patient information. Additional behavioral modification, e.g. of eating and defecation behavior, is superior to pharmacological and dietary management alone. The role of biofeedback therapy in these patients remains to be clarified in the future. It is, however, therapy of choice in some patients with constipation due to spastic pelvic floor syndrome and in fecal incontinence, if the external anal sphincter is insufficient to maintain continence. There ist a systematic lack of treatment opportunities as compared to the number of patients seeking health care for functional bowel disorders.",

The delirium disappeared completely after prednisone was stopped. The delirium led to a long hospital stay of 36 days, weight loss of 10 kg due to undernourishment and extension of home care on discharge. Conclusion This case illustrates that delirium is always lurking around the corner in patients with multiple vulnerabilities. The provoking factor can be slight, for example 15 or 5 mg of prednisone.

      "abstract": "Bladder and bowel dysfunction (BBD) describes a spectrum of lower urinary symptoms (LUTS) accompanied by fecal elimination issues that manifest primarily by constipation and/or encopresis. This increasingly common entity is a potential cause of significant physical and psychosocial burden for children and families. BBD is commonly associated with vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and recurrent urinary tract infections (UTIs), which at its extreme may lead to renal scarring and kidney failure. Additionally, BBD is frequently seen in children diagnosed with behavioural and neuropsychiatric disorders such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Patients with concomitant BBD and neuropsychiatric disorders have less favourable treatment outcomes. Early diagnosis and treatment of BBD are critical to avoid secondary comorbidities that can adversely impact children’s kidney and bladder function, and psychosocial well-being. The majority of patients will improve with urotherapy, adequate fluid intake, and constipation treatment. Pharmacological treatment must only be considered if no improvement occurs after intensive adherence to at least six months of urotherapy ± biofeedback and constipation treatment. Anticholinergics remain the mainstay of medical treatment. Selective alpha-blockers appear to be effective for improving bladder emptying in children with non-neurogenic detrusor overactivity (DO), incontinence, recurrent UTIs, and increased post-void residual (PVR) urine volumes. Alpha-1 blockers can also be used in combination with anticholinergics when overactive bladder (OAB) coexists with functional bladder outlet obstruction. Minimally invasive treatment with onabotulinumtoxinA bladder injections, and recently neurostimulation, are promising alternatives for the management of BBD refractory to behavioural and pharmacological treatment.In this review, we discuss clinical presentation, diagnostic approach, and indications for behavioural, pharmacological, and surgical treatment of BBD in children based on a thorough literature review. Expert opinion will be used when scientific evidence is unavailable.",

      "title": "Etiology of Late Onset Seizures",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:\r\nA ‘seizure’ (meaning “to take possession of”) is a paroxysmal event due to abnormal, excessive, hyper synchronous discharges from an aggregate of central nervous system neurons. Depending on the distribution of discharges, this abnormal CNS activity’s manifestations\r\ncan range from dramatic convulsive activity to experiential phenomena unidentified by the observer. A seizure needs to be distinguished from epilepsy. Epilepsy is described as the condition in which the patient has\r\nrecurrent seizures due to a chronic, underlying process. This definition implies that a person with a single seizures, or recurrent seizure due to correctable or avoidable circumstances, does not necessarily have\r\nepilepsy. Epilepsy can be defined as 2 or more unprovoked seizures. Seizures are separable as convulsive and non convulsive, depending on the prominence of motor features. They are also distinguished as focal or non focal. Seizures with an immediate or proximate cause, such as an acute metabolic disturbance, infection, or\r\nhead trauma, are symptomatic or provoked. In other instances, seizures that may result from past brain injury can be described as remote symptomatic.\r\nIn large number of people, a cause is not identifiable. These seizures are classified to be either idiopathic or cryptogenic. The term idiopathic refers to disease from an unknown cause and is presumed to have a genetic basis. The term cryptogenic implies a symptomatic cause\r\nundiagnosable with current medical technology.\r\nAIM OF THE STUDY:\r\n• To study the clinical profile of patients with new onset seizures after 40 yrs of age.\r\n• To find the etiology of seizures in adult population using clinical methods, CT Scan and Electroencephalography.\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS:\r\n50 patients, above 40 yrs of age, admitted with new onset seizures in medical wards of Government Stanley Hospital during June 2009 to October 2009.\r\nPatients with history of seizures in childhood or any time in past were excluded from the study.\r\nPatients with episodes mimicking seizures like syncope, TIAs and pseudo seizures were identified and excluded from the study.\r\nA detailed history of presenting complaints, details of the seizures, relevant past and personal history were obtained from the patient and reliable attendees. Details of the seizures included:\r\n• First attack,\r\n• Last attack,\r\n• Type of seizures,\r\n• Part of body involved,\r\n• Duration,\r\n• Frequency,\r\n• Maximum period of freedom,\r\n• Time of attack,\r\n• Precipitating factors,\r\n• Aura,\r\n• Post-ictal symptoms,\r\n• Automatisms.\r\nPast history included\r\n• Hypertension, inc. PIH,\r\n• Diabetes mellitius,\r\n• Head injury,\r\n• Previous stroke,\r\n• Cardiovascular (RHD/ MVP/ IHD),\r\n• Respiratory illnesses( COPD/ PTB/ BA),\r\n• Renal transplant,\r\n• Psychiatric illnesses,\r\n• Jaundice,\r\nPersonal history included\r\n• Smoking,\r\n• Drugs,\r\n• Alcohol,\r\n• Snuff,\r\n• Other addictions,\r\n• Pork,\r\n• Sleep,\r\n• Sexual promiscuity.\r\nA detailed general examination, including vital signs recording, complete neurological examination and examination of other systems was done.\r\nNeurological examination included\r\n• Neurocutaneous markers,\r\n• Focal deficits,\r\n• Confusional state,\r\n• Fundus.\r\nInvestigations like Blood counts, Random blood sugar, Renal function tests, Electrolytes, Chest X Ray, ECG, CT Brain- Plain, and EEG were done for all patients.\r\nCT Scans were noted for any clearly abnormal focal lesions. If suspicious lesions were found, a contrast CT Scan/ MRI was obtained depending on the situations.\r\nIn case of acute febrile illness or signs of meningeal irritation associated with the seizures,\r\n• QBC- for malarial parasite and\r\n• Cerebrospinal fluid analysis was done.\r\nLumbar puncture for CSF analysis was done under aseptic\r\nprecautions. CSF was analysed for:\r\n• Biochemistry: Sugar, proteins,\r\n• Cell count: Total, differential,\r\n• Cytology,\r\n• Culture and sensitivity,\r\n• Ziehl-nielson staining,\r\n• When these showed abnormalities, anti HSV antibodies were done when relevant.\r\nIn suspicious patients, like those who had tuberculoma-brain, viral encephalitis, HIV-ELISA and VDRL were done.\r\nCardiac evaluation was done for patients with abnormal physical findings in cardiovascular system, abnormal ECG and for all patients with cerebrovascular etiology (cerebral infarction and intracerebral haemorrhage).\r\nEEG was done for all the patients irrespective of whether an underlying cause was found or not.\r\nThe clinical profile, brain imaging findings, EEG findings were all analysed to derive and etiological diagnosis for the seizures.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\n1. Though late onset seizures was most common in the age group of 50-60 yrs (38%), there was not any significant difference between the other age groups. 36% were seen in the age group 40-5o yrs and 26% in > 70yrs.\r\n2. Males were 1.6 times more in number than females in patients presenting with late onset seizures.\r\n3. Generalised tonic clonic seizures were the commonest (50%), then partial seizures with secondary generalisation (26%), complex partial seizures (20%) and the last being simple partial seizures (4%).\r\n4. Family history does not seem to be relevant in patients with late onset seizures.\r\n5. 28 patients (56%) of patients had significant imaging findings pointing towards the diagnosis. Imaging is the most important factors determining the etiology of seizures. So every patient with new onset of seizures should undergo some form of imaging, CT- Plain/contrast or MRI- Brain depending on the situation as a part of\r\nevaluation.\r\n6. EEG did not contribute much to the diagnosis of etiology of the seizures.\r\n7. The most common etiology for late onset seizures was\r\ncerebrovascular accidents, ischemic events more commonly causing seizures than haemorrhagic events.\r\n8. This was followed by alcoholic withdrawal state, then granulomas and brain tumours.\r\n9. From the study, it is clear that most of the seizures in late adulthood are symptomatic (86%). So every care must be taken to evaluate the cause of new onset seizures in adults.",

      "abstract": "Patients with acute neurological diseases (traumatic brain injury, hemorrhagic or ischemic stroke, spinal cord injury or tumour) may present with various systemic alterations such as changes in cardiovascular and respiratory response, gastrointestinal function disorders, metabolic and endocrinological abnormalities, coagulopathies, among others. Head injury increases the risk of malnutrition due to multiple factors related to nutrient intake, abnormalities in energy expenditure, eating behaviour disorders, gastrointestinal changes, and medication side effects. Gastrointestinal conditions include gastroparesis, which is defined as a delay in gastric emptying in the absence of mechanical obstruction. These patients often report nausea, vomiting, pain, postprandial fullness and abdominal swelling. Although the exact mechanism by which it occurs in traumatic brain injury is not known, it is related to complications such as intracranial hypertension, so it is most often seen in cases of severe trauma. Therefore, the objective of this review is to expose basic and practical concepts about gastroparesis and its approach.",

      "title": "The Landau Reaction (Reflex)",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY The Landau reaction is elicited by supporting the infant horizontally in the air in the prone position. The reaction is present if the infant raises his head and arches his back with the concavity upwards. A subsidiary part of the response is partial extension of the lower limbs at the hip‐joints. The reaction may be elicited in normal infants from the age of about 3 months onwards, is present in most infants in the second six months of life, and becomes increasingly difficult to evoke after the age of one year. Absence of the response in infants over the age of 3 months is seen in association with motor weakness, as in cerebral palsy, motor neurone disease and mental retardation. The Landau reaction represents the combined effects of labyrinthine, neck and visual reactions. RÉSUMÉ La réaction de Landau La réaction de Landau est provoqué lorsque le nourrisson, mis sur le ventre, est maintenu horizontalement en l'air. Il y a réflexe lorsque l'enfant lève la tête et cambre le dos selon une courbe concave vers le haut. Subsidiairement, il se manifeste dans l'extension partielle des membres inférieurs au niveau de l'articulation des hanches. La réaction peut être provoqué chez les nourrissons normaux à partir du troisième mois environ. Elle se trouve chez la plupart des nourrissons agés de six mois à un an, et devient de plus en plus difficile à obtenir au‐delà d'un an. L'absence de réponse chez les nourrissons agés de plus de trois mois se trouve associée à une faiblesse motrice, comme dans la maladie du neurone moteur dans l'infirmité motrice certbrale, et dans l'arriération mentale. La réaction de Landau est dûà l'effet combiné des réactions labyrinthiques, du cou et de la vision. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Die Landausche Reaktion Die Landausche Reaktion wird ausgelost, indem man den Saugling in Bauchlage horizontal in der Luft halt. Die Reaktion ist vorhanden, wenn das Kind den Kopf hebt und den Riicken, mit einer Hohlrundung nach oben, biegt. Ein subsidiarer Teil der Antwort besteht aus Ausstreckung der unteren Glieder in der Gegend des Hiiftengelenks. Die Reaktion kann bei normalen Sauglingen ungefahr vom dritten Monat ab ausgelost werden. Sie ist bei den meisten Sauglingen zwischen sechs Monaten und einem Jahr vorhanden und ist nach dem ersten Lebensjahr immer schwerer auszulosen. Fehlen der Antwort bei Sauglingen uber drei Monaten findet man in Verbindung mit motorischer Schwache wie z.B. inzerebrallahmung, der Krankheit des motorischen Neuronen und bei geistigen Defektzustanden. Die Landausche Reaktion kommt durch die Zusammenwirkung der Labyrinth‐Nackenund Augenreaktionen zustande.",

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title> Background : Miller Fisher Syndrome usually presents with complete ophthalmoplegia, areflexia and ataxia. We present an unusual case which presented with unilateral abducens nerve palsy. Case presentation : A 51 year old female patient presented with a history of difficulty in walking and double vision for 1 week which started 2 weeks following an episode of acute gastroenteritis. She didn’t have any bladder bowel incontinence or difficulty in breathing. On examination there was left side abducens nerve palsy and bilateral significant dysmetria. Upper limb and lower limb power was 4/5 with global areflexia. There was no fatigability or sensory deficit. Higher cortical functions were intact with Glasgow Coma Scale of 15/15. Brain stem cerebro vascular accident, alcohol, toxin or drug mediated disease, myasthenia gravis, Bickerstaff encephalitis and Miller-Fisher syndrome were considered as possible differential diagnosis. There was no history of alcohol consumption or any exposure to drugs or toxins. Her Non contrast brain and MRI brain were normal. Nerve conduction study showed asymmetrical sensory motor and F wave abnormalities consistent with a Guillen-Barre Sydrome variant. Cerebro Spinal Fluid analysis showed albumino-cytological dissociation. These findings suggested the diagnosis of Miller-Fisher Syndrome. She was started on plasmaphareis. Her vital parameters, vital capacity and neurological deficit were closely monitored. With 5 cycles of plasmapharesis she made a complete neurological recovery and she was discharged on 16th day of admission. Conclusion: Miller Fisher Syndrome can present as unilateral abducens nerve palsy and early diagnosis and treatment leads to excellent functional outcome.",

Most available information is based on case reports or series or retrospective clinical experience or patient surveys. Of special interest are pregnancy-induced changes in disease course or severity and likelihood for baseline recovery of function postpartum. Labor and delivery present special challenges in many conditions that affect skeletal but not smooth (uterine) muscle; so labor complications must be anticipated. Anesthesia for cesarean section surgery requires special precautions in many disorders. The types of conditions reviewed are broad and include examples of autoimmune, hereditary, and compressive/mechanical processes. Disorders include carpal tunnel syndrome and other focal neuropathies, Bell palsy, myasthenia gravis, and other neuromuscular junction disorders, acute and chronic inflammatory neuropathy, hereditary and acquired muscle diseases, spinal muscular atrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, channelopathies, autonomic neuropathy, and dysautonomia. Many commonly used therapies have fetal animal but no proven human toxicity concerns, complicating treatment and risk decisions. Weaning off effective therapeutic agents or preemptive aggressive treatment or surgery prior to planned pregnancy is an option in some conditions.",

      "abstract": "Anorexia nervosa is a chronic illness characterized by a severe loss of weight. It occurs in children and young adults and is seen more frequently in females. Some anorexic patients refuse to eat totally, while others may practice \"binge eating.\" Patients who binge eat and employ postprandial purging are referred to as \"bulimic.\" Anorexia nervosa and bulimia can produce multisystem abnormalities. Dysfunction of organ systems in anorexia is the result of self-induced vomiting, laxative abuse, and severe malnutrition. Diseases of the skeletal, gastrointestinal, pulmonary, endocrine, and cardiovascular systems may have an impact on the plan of anesthesia care. A thorough anesthetic interview and evaluation to assess the debilitation of each patient is essential so that appropriate preparation can be made for comprehensive anesthetic care. This paper focuses on the pathophysiology of anorexia nervosa, discusses a thorough preanesthetic assessment, and guides the appropriate anesthetic management of the anorexic patient. Anorexia bulimia is briefly mentioned, since it is an eating disorder with physiological derangements similar to anorexia nervosa.",

The literature concerning the typology of normal consumerism was also reviewed.The prevalence of the disorder in the general population is reported to be 1.1%. The main clinical features of uncontrolled buying are impulsivity and repetition of buying, the invasive need to buy, unsuccessful attempts to control spending, and the existence of tangible negative consequences of buying (marked distress, interference with social or occupational functioning, or financial problems). Uncontrolled buying may be related to obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, addiction, or impulsivity.In most cases, uncontrolled buying can be understood as \"compensatory buying\" that temporarily alleviates depressive symptoms and can thus be associated with the results of antidepressant treatment in cases in which uncontrolled buying is symptomatically associated with depression.",

The three categories of failure to thrive is based on anthropometric measurements of weight, length, and head circumference for age. Type 1 category, inadequate growth or loss of body weight with relatively normal height and head circumference, is the failure to gain weight due mainly to malnutrition. Most of time, the failure to gain weight is detected in a routine visit to the pediatrician. Many parents do not seem to notice the situation until it is brought to their attention. In most instances, the failure to gain weight is insidious and gradual. If malnutrition becomes severe and chronic during the first year of life, the child's neurologic development may be permanently affected, making early recognition and prompt intervention critical.

      "title": "Night eating syndrome: implications for severe obesity",
      "abstract": "Night eating syndrome (NES) was first identified in 1955 by Stunkard, a psychiatrist specialising in eating disorders (ED). Over the last 20 years considerable progress has been made in defining NES as a significant clinical entity in its own right and it has now been accepted for inclusion in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) due for publication in 2013. NES is considered a dysfunction of circadian rhythm with a disassociation between eating and sleeping. Core criteria include a daily pattern of eating with a significantly increased intake in the evening and/or night time, as manifested by one or both of the following: at least 25% of food intake is consumed after the evening meal or at least two episodes of nocturnal eating per week. An important recent addition to core criteria includes the presence of significant distress and/or impairment in functioning. Stunkard's team recommend further investigation on the pathogenesis of NES, in particular its relationship with traumatic life events, psychiatric comorbidity, the age of onset of NES and course of NES over time. The relationship between NES and other ED also requires further clarification as night-eaters exhibit some features of other ED; previous guidance to separate NES from other ED may have hindered earlier characterisation of NES. Evidence from European and American studies suggests NES features strongly in populations with severe obesity. The complex interplay between depression, impaired sleep and obesity-related comorbidity in severely obese individuals makes understanding NES in this context even more difficult. This review examines evidence to date on the characterisation of NES and concludes by examining the applicability of current NES criteria to individuals with severe obesity.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Developmental delay can be associated with epilepsy. Epilepsy might be either the cause of the delay of acquisitions (epileptogenic encephalopathy) or only one additional manifestation, the consequence of the underlying neurological pathology (encephalopathy with epilepsy); it is therefore not the only factor responsible for delay. Within the framework of encephalopathies with epilepsy a rigorous diagnosis is necessary with, in particular a cutaneous examination (neuro‐cutaneous syndromes), a precise clinical examination (anoxo‐ischaemic sequelae of the perinatal period), an EEG, a cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as well as the search for associated abnomalities (cardiac, renal…). There are also epileptogenic encephalopathies such as age‐related syndromes: Hemiconvulsions‐Hemiplegia‐Epilepsy syndrome; Rasmussen's syndrome; Dravet's syndrome; myoclono‐astatic epilepsy (Doose). Age at onset and type of seizures, as well as ictal and interictal EEG finding provide valuable hints for a specific diagnosis, while other investigation are usually not contributive. Developmental delay and epilepsy are frequently associated. One of the first steps to diagnosis consists in trying to establish the eventual causal role of the epilepsy. Answering this question may prove to be of primary importance for the choice of a therapeutic strategy and/or further etiological investigations.",

      "abstract": "Summary Since 1990, significant efforts have been made towards developing interventions to prevent depression. Depression is a serious medical illness that involves brain. Persons of any age-children or adults may develop depression symptoms. Symptoms such as intense sadness, loss of interest or pleasure in normal activities, sleep disturbances or oversleeping, change in appetite and deceased energy level; feeling of helplessness and thoughts of suicide are sequels to stress induced depression. The primary clinical manifestations of major depression are significant depression of mood and impairment of function. Mood and anxiety disorders are the most common mental illnesses. Clinical depression must be distinguished from normal grief, sadness, disappointment and the dysphoria or demoralization often associated with medical illness. Physical changes also occur, particularly in severe, vital, or melancholic depression. These include insomnia or hypersomnia; altered eating patterns, with anorexia and weight loss or sometimes overeating; decreased energy and libido; and disruption of the normal circadian and ultradian rhythms of activity, body temperature and many endocrine functions. Depressed patients usually respond to antidepressant drugs, or, in severe or treatment-resistant cases, to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). This review focuses on knowledge of depression, pharmacological and non-pharmacological measures for its treatment and future directions for the field of depression prevention.",

      "abstract": "Los trastornos de la alimentación son enfermedades mentales crónicas que afectan principalmente a mujeres adolescentes; la depresión, la ansiedad y los medios de comunicación conllevan a las pacientes a modificaciones del hábito alimenticio para conseguir una “figura idónea” y ser socialmente aceptadas. La clasificación según criterios del DSM-V para estos trastornos de la alimentación son anorexia nerviosa (tipo restrictiva y tipo compulsiva/purgativa) y bulimia nerviosa (subclasificada según determinantes de gravedad basados en los episodios bulímicos por semana). La incidencia de estas enfermedades es baja, tienen poco registro epidemiológico y son subdiagnosticadas. Los principales determinantes psicológicos y físicos son la extrema preocupación por la comida, el miedo a aumentar de peso, una imagen corporal distorsionada, la deshidratación y una pérdida anormal de peso, que finalmente llevan al padecimiento de diversas complicaciones orgánicas como alteraciones hidroelectrolíticas y la desnutrición. Hoy en día existen diversos instrumentos que facilitan una detección temprana de conductas de riesgo, y otros que determinan el funcionamiento familiar, la depresión y ansiedad en estas personas. Su tratamiento es interdisciplinario, basado en la psicoterapia, en un manejo médico para las complicaciones orgánicas y un tratamiento psicofarmacológico encaminado a la comorbilidad psiquiátrica teniendo en cuenta que la bulimia nerviosa ha respondido mejor a los fármacos antidepresivos, mientras que en la anorexia nerviosa no existe un tratamiento farmacológico definitivo.",

      "title": "Child and adolescent psychiatry: general aspects of care",
      "abstract": "Child and adolescent psychiatry is a broad dis­cipline relevant to any health professional who has regular contact with young people. Childhood emotional, behavioural, and developmental prob­lems are common, especially in children with other medical or social difficulties. This chapter aims to provide an approach to child mental health diffi­culties, while Chapter 32 deals with common and/ or important psychiatric disorders that are specific to childhood. You may find it helpful to revise some basic child development— this can be found in any general paediatrics text (see ‘Further reading’). An overview of the differences between child and adult psychiatry is shown in Box 17.1. As in adult psychiatry, diagnosis of psychiatric dis­orders often relies on the clinician being able to recog­nize variants of and the limits of normal behaviour and emotions. In children, problems should be classified as either a delay in, or a deviation from, the usual pattern of development. Sometimes problems are due to an excess of what is an inherently normal characteristic in young people (e.g. anger in oppositional defiance disorder), rather than a new phenomenon (e.g. hallu­cinations or self- harm) as is frequently seen in adults. There are four types of symptoms that typically pre­sent to child and adolescent psychiatry services: … 1 Emotional symptoms: anxiety, fears, obsessions, mood, sleep, appetite, somatization. 2 Behavioural disorders: defiant behaviour, aggression, antisocial behaviour, eating disorders. 3 Developmental delays: motor, speech, play, attention, bladder/ bowels, reading, writing and maths. 4 Relationship difficulties with other children or adults…. There will also be other presenting complaints which fit the usual presentation of an adult disorder (e.g. mania, psychosis), and these are classified as they would be in an adult. Occasionally, there will also be a situ­ation where the child is healthy, but the problem is ei­ther a parental illness, or abuse of the child by an adult. Learning disorders are covered in Chapter 19. Table 17.1 outlines specific psychiatric conditions diagnosed at less than 18 years, and Box 17.2 lists general psychiatric conditions that are also commonly found in children.",

Evidence for this linkage comes from a literature review, from patient interviews, from responses to an instrument we have developed (the Self‐Harm Behavior Survey), and from three instructive case reports. Even if the self‐mutilation in these patients is regarded as a Borderline Personality Disorder symptom, DSM‐IV should list it as an associated feature or a complication of Anorexia Nervosa/Bulimia Nervosa. In lieu of a dual diagnosis, we postulate that the combination of self‐mutilation, anorexia, bulimia, and other symptoms (such as episodic alcohol abuse and swallowing foreign objects) may be manifestations of an impulse control disorder known as the “deliberate self‐harm syndrome.”",

      "title": "Understanding vomiting from the perspective of traditional Chinese medicine.",
      "abstract": "Vomiting is a common clinical symptom in which the conditions associated with impaired homeostasis and qi flow ascend reversely within the stomach, resulting in the expulsion of the stomach's contents through the mouth. The stomach, located in the middle warmer (also known as Zhong Jiao), is primarily responsible for receiving and digesting food and liquid, and its qi typically flows downward. Various unfavorable conditions associated with the environment, food, mental health, or physiological stress can compromise the stomach, thereby leading to a loss of gastric homeostasis, which often triggers vomiting. However, regardless of external factors or internal weaknesses, the direct cause of vomiting is the loss of gastric homeostasis and the ascending qi flow. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) built its understanding of vomiting from the long-term accumulation of clinical observations and treatments, which were used to gradually improve and develop relevant theories, diagnoses, and treatments. This review paper presents vomiting from the nonaggressive perspective of TCM; specifically, we summarize TCM's unique insights with regard to vomiting across various aspects including its etiology, diagnosis, locations, relationships with other organs, dialectical treatment, and drug and medical characteristics. By revealing the abundance of TCM's theoretical and clinical knowledge concerning vomiting, we attempt to integrate Chinese and western medicines to treat it. In addition, the valuable knowledge that TCM provides with regard to vomiting certainly deserves better understanding to develop and improve modern medicine.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Dysphagia refers to the feeling of difficulty in passing food or liquid from the mouth to the stomach and requires rapid neuromuscular coordination not only of the esophagus but also structures in the oral cavity, pharynx, and larynx during a brief cessation of respiration. The swallowing mechanism can be separated into three stages: oral, pharyngeal, and esophageal. Disabilities resulting directly from dysphagia may arise secondary to aspiration, and the ongoing risk of aspiration has several consequences: limited oral intake of solid food and liquids, restriction of the diet (eg, to foods of a certain consistency), need for assistance when eating, and discomfort associated with eating. Evaluation usually includes assessment by a speech-language pathologist and often is supplemented by a modified barium swallow or a fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing. The AMA Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment describes the process for evaluating impairment for dysphagia in Chapter 4, The Nervous System, Chapter 9, Ear, Nose, Throat, and Related Structures, and Chapter 10, The Digestive System. Section 9.3b, Mastication and Deglutition, includes information about the relationship of dietary restrictions to permanent impairment. Impairment for dysphagia is determined by considering the underlying cause for the dysphagia, dietary restrictions, feeding requirements, and complications.",

Symptoms such as bloating are also often present. The complexity of the pathophysiology of IBS is attested by the range of mechanisms that have been proposed. These include abnormalities in motility, visceral sensation, brain–gut interactions and psychosocial distress. More recently, evidence has emerged for altered gut immune activation, intestinal permeability and intestinal microbiome. Carefully phenotyping and characterisation of large cohorts of IBS patients across multiple centres might help identification of mechanism-based patient stratification. The severity of abdominal pain varies between mild to severe, and is usually episodic and may be cramping in nature. The diagnosis of IBS is built on symptom criteria, but the gastrointestinal tract has a limited language and symptoms may overlap with many treatable organic conditions.",

The most common treatment for psychomotor delay in children consists in enforcing postural changes. Prolonged crying when children are changed to a new position can be a sign of a sensory processing disorder. Addressing sensory and motor aspects simultaneously may be an effective approach. Case report. A 13-month-old child with psychomotor delay was referred to our service for early intervention. On assessment, the child did not turn into any decubitus and was not able to move or crawl on its own. He was able to take small steps when held, but tiptoeing. He was able to uphold a sitting position and play, and he had a mature pincer grip. He had some primitive or tonic reflexes, such as the positive support, tonic labyrinthine, and symmetrical tonic cervical reflexes. Comments. After two months of treatment, the child did not longer cry when he was led into postural changes. He was able to move sequentially from a sitting position into an oblique sitting position, and then into a hands-and-knees crawling position. Family participation was essential in this process.",

For example, you might hear a voice that no one else in the room can hear or see an image that isn’t real. These symptoms may be caused by mental illnesses, the side effects of medications, or physical illnesses like epilepsy or alcohol use disorder. You may need to visit a psychiatrist, a neurologist, or a general practitioner depending on the cause of your hallucinations. Treatment may include taking medication to treat a health condition. Your doctor may also recommend adopting different behaviours like drinking less alcohol and getting more sleep to improve your hallucinations",

      "abstract": "It is recognized that patients with anorexia nervosa commonly have other psychiatric illnesses. No study, to our knowledge, has determined whether these other psychiatric disorders occur prior to the age of onset of anorexia nervosa. We obtained a retrospective history from 24 subjects who were long term (more than 1 year) recovered from anorexia nervosa. We found that 58% reported that they had the onset of one or more childhood anxiety disorder diagnoses at the age of 10 +/- 5 years old. This was 5 years before the mean age of onset of anorexia nervosa. The onset of depression was about 1 year before the onset of anorexia nervosa in about one half the subjects. Alcohol and substance abuse/dependency tended to occur after the onset of anorexia nervosa and only occurred in anorexic subjects who binged and/or purged. The early and common onset of childhood anxiety disorders in a substantial percentage of anorexics raises the possibility that childhood anxiety disorders herald the first behavioral expression of a biologic vulnerability in some subjects who develop anorexia nervosa.",

Depression is common and serious problem that often starts in childhood. Today is estimated that approximatly 10-15% of children in general population has syptoms of depression. It is associated with an increased risk of other psychiatric disorders, poor academic success, underdeveloped social skills and even suicidal thoughts. The primary symptoms of depression are continuous feelings of sadness and hopelessness and mood changes. Symptoms of depression in children also include irritability or anger, social withdrawal, changes in appetite (either increased or decreased), changes in sleep (sleeplessness or excessive sleep), difficulty concentrating, etc. Depressive disorders include Major depressive disorder, dysthymic disorder, depressive disorder, indeterminate and bipolar disorder. Depression in children can be caused by any combination of factors that relate to physical health, life events, family history, environment, genetic vulnerability and biochemical disturbance. Depression should be recognized and diagnosed as early as possible in children and adolescents in order to start treatment on time. The most efficient treatment is a treatment that is not focused on depressive symptoms only, but also on functioning on daily bases in children.",

The parasomnias comprise different entities such as nightmares, REM-sleep behavior disorder, sleep enuresis, and bruxism. Diagnosis and treatment often require a multidisciplinary approach. Virtually every psychiatric, neurologic, or medical disease, when of sufficient severity, leaves its specific fingerprint on sleep; some disorders, such as peptic ulcer disease, gastroesophageal reflux, or epilepsy, tend to be exacerbated during sleep. Fortunately, most sleep disorders are amenable to therapy, which can include counseling, sleep hygiene, withholding of an offending agent, behavioral therapy, light therapy, or cautious drug therapy.",

      "abstract": "Summary Purpose: To consider the definition of acute symptomatic seizures for epidemiological studies, and to refine the criteria used to distinguish these seizures from unprovoked seizures for specific etiologies. Methods: Systematic review of the literature and of epidemiologic studies. Results: An acute symptomatic seizure is defined as a clinical seizure occurring at the time of a systemic insult or in close temporal association with a documented brain insult. Suggestions are made to define acute symptomatic seizures as those events occurring within 1 week of stroke, traumatic brain injury, anoxic encephalopathy, or intracranial surgery; at first identification of subdural hematoma; at the presence of an active central nervous system (CNS) infection; or during an active phase of multiple sclerosis or other autoimmune diseases. In addition, a diagnosis of acute symptomatic seizure should be made in the presence of severe metabolic derangements (documented within 24 h by specific biochemical or hematologic abnormalities), drug or alcohol intoxication and withdrawal, or exposure to well‐defined epileptogenic drugs. Discussion: Acute symptomatic seizures must be distinguished from unprovoked seizures and separately categorized for epidemiologic purposes. These recommendations are based upon the best available data at the time of this report. Systematic studies should be undertaken to better define the associations in question, with special reference to metabolic and toxic insults, for which the time window for the occurrence of an acute symptomatic seizure and the absolute values for toxic and metabolic dysfunction still require a clear identification.",

      "abstract": "In clinical practice, patients can present with many different diseases, often both somatic and mental. Holistic medicine will try to see the diseases as a whole, as symptoms of a more fundamental imbalance in the state of being. The holistic physician must help the patient to recover existence and a good relationship with self. According to the life mission theory, theory of character, and holistic process theory of healing, recovering the purpose of life (the life mission) is essential for the patient to regain life, love, and trust in order to find happiness and realize the true purpose of life. We illustrate the power of the holistic medical approach with a case study of an invalidated female artist, aged 42 years, who suffered from multiple severe health problems, many of which had been chronic for years. She had a combination of neurological disturbances (tinnitus, migraine, minor hallucinations), immunological disturbances (recurrent herpes simplex, phlegm in the throat, fungal infection in the crotch), hormonal disturbances (14 days of menstruation in each cycle), muscle disturbances (neck tensions), mental disturbances (tendency to cry, inferiority feeling, mild depression, desolation, anxiety), abdominal complaints, hemorrhoids, and more. The treatment was a combined strategy of improving the general quality of life, recovering her human character and purpose of life (“renewing the patients life energy”, “balancing her global information system”), and processing the local blockages, thus healing most of her many different diseases in a treatment using 30 h of intense holistic therapy over a period of 18 months.",

      "abstract": "Neurological involvement is a typical feature of several inherited metabolic diseases. The onset of signs and/or symptoms may appear as early as the first days of life or after an interval of normal or near-normal growth and development. Metabolic decomposition usually presents with a severe clinical phenotype, which include poor feeding, vomiting, lethargy, seizures, and loss of consciousness. This spectrum of manifestations is often fatal; however, severe neurological sequelae and/or regression of neurodevelopmental milestones can be the prominent signs in those who survive. Overall, treatable inborn errors of metabolism can be divided in three groups, namely: (Group 1) inborn errors of intermediary metabolism giving rise to acute or chronic intoxication; (Group 2) inborn errors of intermediary metabolism affect in genergetic processes; and (Group 3) inborn errors involving cellular organelles, including lysosomal, peroxisomal, glycosylation, and cholesterol synthesis defects. The spectrum of neurological manifestations includes developmental delay, seizures and epilepsy, pyramidal and extrapyramidal signs, movement disorders, vision and hearing impairment, peripheral neuropathy, and psychiatric abnormalities. The main anatomical/imaging patterns reflects selective vulnerability of nervous system substance and include atrophy, (predominantly) symmetrical abnormalities, and dysmyelination, As several patients with neurometabolic diseases responds favorably to therapeutic trials, early detection and early intervention is of utmost importance to prevent catabolic-related damage and to revert to normal or near-normal parameters neurodevelopmental milestones.",

Alcoholic withdrawal, when complicated by acute hallucinations, disorientation, excitement, and hyperkinesia, is a difficult condition to manage in the average general hospital, unless the hospital is equipped with specific facilities for handling confused, disoriented, and perhaps belligerent patients. For this reason, or excuse, many general hospitals refuse admission to alcoholic patients; often physicians too may be guilty of shunning the alcoholic patient and refusing to accept him psychologically or realistically as a sick person in need of hospital care.

Acute organ failure results in an abrupt, but often reversible, lowering of seizure threshold, whereas chronic organ failure results in more pervasive and indolent cerebral compromise, often permanently altering both the seizure threshold and the physiologic responses to antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). Failure of an organ system is not typically a sudden, all-or-none phenomenon but occurs in stages with variable susceptibility to seizures as the condition worsens or remits. Although the principles of diagnosis and management of seizures in adult and pediatric patients with a specific organ dysfunction are similar, the underlying etiologies and influences of comorbid conditions differ between adults and children. Adult organ failure often involves multiple systems to different extents and is superimposed on other chronic diseases of adulthood. Pediatric organ failure is usually the result of inherited metabolic disorders, infections, and unique pediatric susceptibilities to metabolic effects of medications (Table 1).",

      "abstract": "Posttraumatic stress disorder or PTSD is an extreme psycho-physiological response disorder that may occur in individuals who are exposed to a potentially traumatic event that can involve the subjectively profound threat of loss... of life or limb. To receive a PTSD diagnosis, reactions to the catastrophic or traumatic stressor must involve profound fear, helplessness, or horror. Furthermore, such individuals have to experience symptoms from three separate yet co-occurring symptom clusters. These clusters or domains include: 1) intrusive recollections or the re-experiencing of the event with accompanied intense psychological distress or physiologic reactivity; 2) persistent avoidance of activities, thoughts as well as feelings associated with the traumatic event; and, 3) increased or extreme arousal that may include an exaggerated startle response, hypervigilance, or insomnia (American Psychiatric Association, 1994; Uddin et al., 2010) To justify a PTSD diagnosis, symptoms must be present for at least one month, and impair an individual’s interpersonal, occupational, or social functioning (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). PTSD has been described as a specific phenotype that develops as the result of a failure to contain the normal stress response (Yehuda & LeDoux, 2007), resulting in dysregulation of the hypothalamic– pituitary–adrenal or HPA axis, a major stress response system of the body that interacts with the immune system to maintain homeostasis (Wong, 2002). PTSD-affected and unaffected individuals have distinct expression patterns in genes involved in immune activation (Segman et al., 2005; Zieke et al., 2007), and in genes that encode neural and endocrine proteins (Segman et al., 2005; Yehuda et al., 2009). Above all, PTSD is both an external and internal experience; that is, PTSD is an external catastrophic or traumatic event and an internal psycho-physiological experience.",

The causes varied from benign such as postviral acute cerebellar ataxia and benign paroxysmal vertigo to potentially life-threatening such as intoxication with benzodiazepines and medulloblastoma. Treatment led to complete or partial recovery. (Sub)acute balance disorders in previously healthy children can be due to cerebellar ataxia, vestibular disorders and abnormal proprioception. Ancillary investigations are warranted in case of gradually developing ataxia, accompanying neurological deficits, suspicion of intoxication, recurrent or familial ataxia, no spontaneous remission or even progression. In children with an isolated cerebellar ataxia without these features, ancillary investigations may be avoided, although in such cases careful follow-up remains necessary.",

      "title": "Delayed speech development in children: Introduction to terminology",
      "abstract": "There has been recently an increase in the number of children diagnosed with delayed speech development. There is delay compensation with age, but mild deficiency often remains for life. Delayed speech development is more common in boys than in girls. Its etiology is unknown in most cases, so a child should be followed up to make an accurate diagnosis. Genetic predisposition or environmental factors frequently influence speech development. The course of its delays is various. In the history of a number of disorders (childhood disintegrative disorder, Landau–Kleffner syndrome), there is evidence for the normal development of speech to a certain period and then stops or even regresses. By way of comparison, there are generally speech developmental changes in autism even during the preverbal stage (a complex of revival fails to form; babbling is poor, low emotional, gibberish; at the same time, the baby recipes whole phrases without using them to communicate). These speech disorders are considered not only as a delay, but also as a developmental abnormality. Speech disorders in children should be diagnosed as early as possible in order to initiative corrective measures in time. In this case, a physician makes a diagnosis and a special education teacher does corrective work. The successful collaboration and mutual understanding of the specialists in these areas will determine quality of life for a child in the future. This paper focusses on the terminology and classification of delays, which are necessary for physicians and teachers to speak the same language.",

      "title": "Role of add on rTMS in management of insomnia",
      "abstract": "Sir, Insomnia is a major health concern. The interhemispheric connectivity is disrupted in specific brain areas (middle occipital, posterior middle temporal gyrus) without alterations in structural and local morphological changes in patients with chronic insomnia.[1] Studies have found cortical alterations as well as intracortical excitability in patients with insomnia and also among healthy controls with sleep deprivation, using single and paired pulse repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS).[23] These neurophysiological changes are amenable to be altered by neuromodulation techniques such as rTMS. We describe here a case of an adult male with predominant insomnia who improved with rTMS. A 49-years-old nondiabetic and nonhypertensive male sought psychiatric consultation for multiple, nonspecific pain symptoms (body ache and burning pain in the eyes) and gastric discomfort (fullness of the abdomen, acid reflux, and epigastric pain). These complaints were associated with anxiety. Premorbidly, he used to have 6–8 h of sleep, but during the course of his illness, the sleep duration had been reduced to <1 h/day. There was no past or family history of psychiatric illness. The patient had never used any psychoactive substance. The patient consulted several physicians and was investigated extensively with no noticeable abnormalities. He had been treated with various antidepressants and benzodiazepines in combination, in the past without much benefit. Due to little improvement in sleep, the patient had overmedicated himself several times in the past. He adopted several lifestyle modifications (regular aerobic exercise, dietary modifications, and practice of yoga), without any noticeable benefit. He was always preoccupied with the thought of having some major physical illness. He was hospitalized for his complaints of persistent sleep disturbance. His general physical examination and systemic examination did not reveal any abnormality. On mental status examination, his mood was anxious and he had illness preoccupation. He was diagnosed with somatoform disorder with chronic tension-type headache with chronic primary insomnia. At the time of hospitalization, the patient was on desvenlafaxine 100 mg/day, trazodone 100 mg/day, zolpidem 10 mg/day, and clonazepam 1 mg/day, with a sleep duration of 2–3 h/day. Due to inadequate response to pharmacotherapy, he was considered for rTMS. After informed consent, he was started with low-frequency rTMS (1 Hz) over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex at 80% of resting motor threshold. We adopted the protocol used in a previous study.[4] At baseline evaluation, his Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) score was 16 (poor sleep quality) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) score was 19 (clinical insomnia of moderate severity). He was given a total of 15 sessions of rTMS with 1800 pulses per se ssion along with ongoing pharmacotherapy. After 15 days of daily rTMS, he showed a significant improvement in his sleep. His sleep increased to 4–5 h per night and his PSQI and ISI scores became 11 and 10, respectively. His somatic complaints were also resolved completely. He was discharged on desvenlafaxine 100 mg/day, trazodone 100 mg/day, and zolpidem (sustained-release preparation) 12.5 mg/day. In 3-week follow-up, he was well-maintained. There was no medical cause that attributed to the symptoms in our case. The patient's insomnia was refractory to pharmacotherapy, psychological interventions, and lifestyle modification measures. As insomnia was of longer duration (>30 days), unrelated to the course of psychiatric illness and causing significant distress to the individual, the possibility of primary insomnia was more likely. Symptoms of somatoform disorder did not improve completely with conventional pharmacotherapy, which might be due to persisting insomnia. Behavioral interventions focusing on sleep hygiene are the mainstay treatment of chronic insomnia.[5] Pharmacological and psychological interventions are commonly recommended for the treatment of insomnia.[6] Jiang et al. had evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of rTMS in chronic primary insomnia and found that patients receiving rTMS had a significant improvement in Stage III and rapid eye movement sleep and sleep architecture as well as had fewer relapses and recurrence rates.[4] Considering the refractoriness of insomnia, we considered rTMS for our patient. The patient had shown noticeable benefits to add on rTMS, which remained stable over the next 3 months (till last follow-up). Recent evidence suggests that bilateral sequential low-frequency rTMS was useful in the management of primary insomnia. The therapeutic effect of bilateral sequential low-frequency rTMS is mediated through elevation of levels of neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid and brain-derived neurotrophic factor.[7] The uniqueness in our case was that the patient's somatic symptoms had also improved substantially after 15 sessions of rTMS. This shows the effect of rTMS as an augmenting therapy in nonorganic insomnia patients. Further research is needed to understand the efficacy of rTMS in insomnia management as a stand-alone treatment.

      "title": "Pediatric Phagophobia: A Systematic Review and a Case Report of Pharmacological Interventions",
      "abstract": "Background: Phagophobia is characterized by conditioned excessive fear of swallowing or choking that is usually triggered by an incident. It usually leads to avoidance of certain types of food or, in severe forms, a complete refusal to eat solid food and/or liquids. The condition is commonly associated with physical and psychological symptoms impacting the health condition of the individual due to deprivation of essential nutrients. Case Presentation: A 12-year-old boy developed acute onset fear of swallowing (Phagophobia) following a dream he had of someone choking. This was exacerbated by watching an online video of a person choking. This has led to an avoidance of solid food and dependence on soft food and liquids. Fear of swallowing along with food avoidance has led to malnutrition, weight loss, and several physical complaints for which the patient was admitted under pediatric care. A course of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) resulted in limited response and was augmented with fluoxetine. Full remission was achieved within six weeks. Methods: A systematic review of all peer-reviewed English literature was performed for articles related to the pharmacological treatment of pediatric phagophobia (0-18 years) following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Results: A total of 17 case reports were identified describing 17 children with phagophobia (females = 70 %). The mean age was 9.3 and the average was between 2 and 15 years who were diagnosed with choking phobia/ phagophobia or different but equivalent diagnoses like Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder or Post Traumatic Feeding Disorder. Different classes of medications were used in variable doses for different durations which were associated with significant improvement in eating patterns and reduction in fear and anxiety associated with eating. Conclusion: Phagophobia is a serious and potentially life-threatening illness that can cause physical complications and functional impairment in the psychosocial aspect. Pharmacological treatment can be a beneficial and safe option either alone or in combination with therapeutic interventions for children presenting with phagophobia.",

      "abstract": "The modern education system is characterized by the introduction of new, specialized, and author's programs, which are highly variable, accompanied by the intensification of the educational process, increasing the total workload, reducing physical activity, and deteriorating the structure of the daily routine of students. Such changes in the organization of the educational process lead to an increase in the level of pathological lesions, asthenoneurotic reactions, and symptoms of dysfunction of somatic systems. A particularly vulnerable category of students is gifted children, who on the one hand, experience discrimination at school due to the partial lack of differentiated learning, focus on the average student, and excessive unification of programs that do not take into account individual learning opportunities. On the other hand, intellectually gifted children showed a decrease in overall reactivity and tension of adaptation mechanisms, greater susceptibility to acute infectious diseases, the presence of autonomic disorders, hypotension and syncope, more often registered pathology of the gastrointestinal tract, musculoskeletal system, and allergies conditions than at the \"average intellectuals\". Therefore, this category of students needs a special approach and a deeper study of the impact of elements of the learning process on their health. Two separate areas of research have been formed by now. They are related to the study of psychological and pedagogical aspects of teaching children on innovative educational technologies, on the one hand, and the state of health of schoolchildren, on the other hand. However, only a few studies have been conducted where these two areas are combined and the direct impact of the educational process on new educational projects on disorders in morphofunctional, psychoemotional, and general health of students is determined, risk factors of the educational process are identified and recommendations for the prevention of school maladaptation are provided. Conclusion. Information analysis of scientific sources on current issues of education and medical care for gifted children and adolescents shows the interest of society in conducting further medical and pedagogical research to develop preventive measures to preserve their health. There is an urgent need for hygienic optimization of educational activities, proper regulation of innovative pedagogical technologies, development of appropriate guidelines for the prevention of school maladaptation",

Standard antiepileptic medication for seizure disorder; standard treatment for abnormal vision and/or strabismus, sleep disturbance, scoliosis, joint laxity, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), constipation, and developmental issues. Surveillance: Assessment of growth parameters, feeding difficulties, GERD, constipation, scoliosis, developmental progress, and behavior at each visit. Monitor seizures as clinically indicated. Assessment of vision and eye alignment as needed. Genetic counseling BCL11A-ID is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner; however, most affected individuals have the disorder as the result of a de novo BCL11A pathogenic variant.

Clinical evaluation of patients with possible gastric motility disorders may include gastric emptying tests and possibly tests of gastric accommodation. This chapter discusses normal gastric motility to gain a greater appreciation for the abnormalities found in symptomatic patients. A focus has also been on patients with symptoms suggestive of delayed gastric emptying but with normal gastric emptying. There is an overlap of symptoms of gastroparesis and functional dyspepsia. Proximal retention may be seen in gastroesophageal reflux disease, distal retention in functional dyspepsia, and global retention in gastroparesis. Gastroparesis occurs in many clinical settings; the most common are diabetes mellitus, sequelae of gastric surgery, and idiopathic. The chapter addresses abnormalities of gastric motility and sensation in functional dyspepsia. Refractory symptoms lead to a comprehensive evaluation, including gastric emptying scintigraphy and possibly tests of gastric accommodation or compliance.",

The sleep disturbance causes significant distress or impairment of functioning. There may be a feeling of having been awake all night even when getting some sleep.\n\nPeople with comorbid disorders of physical or mental health, such as depression, have higher rates of insomnia. Depression and sleep disturbance are the first and third most common psychological reasons for patient encounters in general practice.4 Untreated, insomnia increases the risk of development or exacerbation of anxiety, depression, hypertension, and diabetes.5 6 This article outlines current concepts in insomnia and provides up to date information on treatment.\n\nMost people will experience sleep disturbance or acute insomnia at some point in any given year. This often occurs around predictable times of stress or when sleep patterns are disrupted, such as with travel, busy periods at work, illness, or emotional upset. While people may be distressed about sleep loss during acute insomnia, once the trigger factors are removed, sleep usually returns to normal.\n\nInsomnia becomes chronic when someone has difficulty either getting to sleep or staying asleep for at least three nights a week (not necessarily every night) for at least three months and is distressed by their sleep symptoms. …",

The syndrome is characterized by hypersomnia (up to 20 hours a day), cognitive symptoms (mainly derealisation, but also confusion, delusions, and/or hallucinations, memory impairments), behavioral symptoms (sexual disinhibition, irritability/aggression, compulsive eating), and mental symptoms such as depression and anxiety [4,8-13]. There are also physical signs such as autonomic dysfunction, weight gain; and at the end of the episodes, amnesia, elation, and depression. It is important to underline that these symptoms and signs are generally not combined in a single patient. The average length of an episode is 8 to 10 days, and episodes lasting several months are relatively exceptional. They usually recover after a period of about 8 years.",

      "title": "Kleine-Levin Syndrome with Rapid Cycling - Case Report and Review of the Literature (P5.294)",
      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Describe a patient with Kleine-Levin Syndrome (KLS) with rapid cycling of hypersomnia episodes and autonomic changes.\nBACKGROUND: KLS exists in the borderland between psychiatry and neurology. It is often misdiagnosed as depression, bipolar disorder, psychosis or seizures. It is estimated to be a rare disorder (1.5 cases per million population), typically in adolescent males and preceded by a triggering event, such as infections or head trauma.\nDESIGN/METHODS: We describe the case of a 14 yo boy with a previous history of childhood absence epilepsy, off medications for 1 year at presentation. A few days after an upper airway infection, he developed hypersomnia, sleeping over 15h/day. When awake, he exhibited bradyphrenia and altered perception, stating “things are not right, I feel as if I am not here”. Family reported dishinhibition, alternating hypo/hyperphagia and speaking in “baby talk” in a regressed fashion.\nSymptoms improved without specific treatment but he relapsed every 2-3 weeks, with cycles lasting 10-14 days each. Investigation included two lumbar punctures, with non-inflammatory results and negative bacterial/viral studies. Serological studies were unrevealing. Imaging was unremarkable. Long-term EEG was normal. Toxicology, thyroid function, vasculitis, paraneoplastic panel and autoimmune panel were all negative. B12, thiamine and folate were normal. Psychiatric evaluation did not elicit diagnostic criteria for mood, somatic or other mental health conditions.\nRESULTS: A repeat EEG showed intermittent delta slowing. Heart rate monitoring displayed alternating periods of bradycardia with tachycardia. HLA typing was positive for DQB1*0201 which has been reported in patients with KLS patients and may support autoimmune etiology. Symptoms were suggestive of KLS and he was started on modafinil with improved hypersomnia. He was tried on valproic acid and lithium for treatment of the rapid cycling of symptoms without improvement.\nCONCLUSIONS: KLS has significant morbidity if unrecognized. We review and discuss updated diagnostic criteria, pathophysiology and management. This case exemplifies an unusual rapid cycling pattern of hypersomnia episodes associated with classic KLS symptoms. Disclosure: Dr. Maski has nothing to disclose. Dr. Urion has nothing to disclose.",

Mirtazapine is associated with few adverse events but potential for a discontinuation syndrome does exist. Here we describe a case of a 53-year-old man prescribed mirtazapine 15 mg/day for appetite stimulation who experienced anxiousness, nausea, tremor, loss of appetite, lack of desire for food, and an 8-pound weight loss after abrupt, inadvertent discontinuation. Symptom onset was acute and presented within 48-hours of stopping his medication. Mirtazapine was restarted at the same dose after 14 days of ongoing symptoms and his symptoms subsided immediately. Scant literature exists to highlight the potentially serious adverse events associated with abrupt mirtazapine discontinuation, even at low doses, and this case contributes to advocating for the need of mirtazapine taper when medication cessation is being considered.",

Diagnosis of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder requires the presence of persistent obsessions, compulsions, or both (more than 1 hour each day) that are repetitive and difficult to control. In addition, the symptoms must cause marked distress or cause significant interference in functioning.

      "abstract": "IntroductionInflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with an increased prevalence of depression when compared to the general population. Studies have suggested that depression may be more pronounced in the early period of diagnosis, with the strongest association occurring within one year of diagnosis. It has also been documented that depression can amplify symptoms, decrease medication compliance, alter self-perception and worsen individuals' adaptation to their disease. It is recommended that all IBD patients be screened for depression. We present 2 cases of patients with IBD who were hospitalized with suicidal ideation at the time or shortly following their IBD diagnosis. These cases emphasize the need to screen for depression with assessment for severity.Case 1: A 45 year old man was hospitalized with depression and suicidal ideation with a plan. His psychiatric interview revealed that he was profoundly depressed as a result of ‘years' of chronic, frequent (50-60 times daily) diarrhea with blood, urgency, nocturnal awakening and fecal incontinence which had worsened in recent months. He had no history of depression or psychiatric disorders and a previous history of cocaine dependency was not thought to contribute to his depression. Gastroenterology consult was obtained and following an evaluation he was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis. Treatment with 6-mercaptopurine, mesalamine, and tapering steroids (with discontinuation) resulted in clinical improvement of his gastrointestinal symptoms and resolution of his depression.Case 2: A 37 year old woman without significant past medical history transferred her care to our institution and presented to Gastroenterology clinic for a second opinion of rectal pain and bleeding following a hemorrrhoidectomy. Medical records revealed that she presented to an outside surgeon with complaints of hemorrhoids. Rectal fissures and a large hemorrhoid complex were noted and she underwent a fissurectomies and a hemorrhoidectomy which resulted in chronic fecal drainage and incontinence. A rectal exam under anesthesia revealed rectal ulcerations and a large nonhealing wound in the posterior midline which extended through her internal and part of her external sphincter. A colonoscopy revealed pancolitis with biopsies demonstrating chronic active colitis and noncaseating granulomas. She was diagnosed with Crohn's disease. Two weeks following the diagnosis she was hospitalized with depression and suicidal ideation. Psychiatric interview revealed that her depression was related to her gastrointestinal symptoms and new Crohn's diagnosis. Improvement of her symptoms with oral and topical mesalamine, 6-mercaptopurine and tapering steroids has resulted in improvement of her depression. The psychiatrists did not believe that her steroid therapy precipitated or exacerbated her depression. She is not maintained on antidepressants.",

      "title": "Children Who Starve Themselves: Anorexia Nervosa",
      "abstract": "Although the 15 children in this study fit into the classic picture of anorexia nervosa, the title of the report is a misnomer, since none of the patients experienced marked anorexia. The failure to eat resulted from fear of eating, rather than loss of appetite. Previous workers are in agreement that this disorder represents a syndrome rather than a disease entity and that it may occur in people with various types of personalities and various degrees of ego strength. While many bizarre fantasies are associated in the patients' minds with the eating disturbance, the literature does not contain information about why, in these patients, such fantasies become associated with enough anxiety and guilt to require the defense of not eating. Our patients denied that they were starving themselves to the point of emaciation, were greatly preoccupied with food during their illnesses, and often served food to the other children on the ward. Preconscious and conscious fantasies relating to food and eating included animistic ideas about food, delusions that certain kinds of food were poisonous, fear of oral impregnation and gastric pregnancy, ideas of anal birth, orally aggressive and sometimes cannibalistic impulses, and the equation of not eating with a lifelong childlike dependent status. We had expected to find more evidence of repression of the fantasies connected with eating. We now believe isolation of affect was the chief defense mechanism that permitted such bizarre ideas to remain accessible to awareness. Open conflict between the mothers and grandmothers of many of our patients was a prominent factor during the patients' infancies. The children often recreated this conflict, using food as the bone of contention, while they were ill. The anxiety-laden fantasies about food and eating, preoccupation with food, fear of adult sexuality, and reluctance to give up the child's dependent status that were present in our patients often paralleled identical fantasies and attitudes of their parents. Contrary to our expectations, we obtained a history of early feeding disturbances in only 8 patients and have discussed the possible significance of this finding. The events that precipitated anorexia nervosa in these children do not differ from those associated with other psychological disorders. The connection between the precipitating events and the specific symptom of not eating only becomes evident in the context of the child's fantasies or the family myths shared by the child. None of these girls menstruated during anorexia; starvation is not the major factor in producing the amenorrhea. Our patients showed a high degree of anxiety about the menses and other sexual functions. The link between menstrual function and anorexia appeared most typically as amenorrhea pregnancy, or amenorrhea and not eating equals regression to babyhood. Manifest depression, present in all but 2 patients, differs from classic clinical depression. This finding is consistent with previous observations that children, in general, do not show classic depression. Efforts to formulate the anorexia syndrome exclusively in terms of the dynamics of depression have failed. Regression is as characteristic of anorexia nervosa as is depression. While regression is characteristic of children with psychiatric disorders in general, and also of children with physical illnesses, our patients seemed more deeply regressed than children with any other psychological disorder (except psychosis) and also more deeply regressed than other physically ill children. We have discussed how the particularly severe ambivalence present in the parents of these children may foster a particularly deep regression in the child. Lastly, we have noted some factors that seem related to the outcome of this syndrome.",

      "title": "CLINICAL APPROACH TO THE MANAGEMENT OF INTRACTABLE EPILEPSY",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY Resistance of seizures to anti‐epileptic therapy may be due to patient error, or to physician diagnostic and/or treatment error, rather than being truly intractable epilepsy. Increased drug dosage, irrespective of blood levels, a change of drug, or the addition of a second drug, are variously indicated in truly resistant cases. The use of more than two drugs is better avoided, and in some cases reduction of treatment may improve seizure control while lessening side‐effects. Repeated assessment of patients with refractory epilepsy is important, as causative or provocative factors may remain latent for long periods. Surgical therapy probably should be used more often and earlier than it now is for epilepsies that are medically intractable. RÉSUMÉ Approche clinique de la prise en charge de I'épilepsie irréductible La résistance des crises au traitement épileptique peut étre dûe à des erreurs du patient (style de vie désordonné, manque de compliànce) ou à des erreurs des médecins dans le diagnostic ou le traitement plutol que de traduire une véritable épilepsie irréductible. Un accroissement des doses de médicament, négligeant les taux sériques, une modification de médication ou l'addition d'un second médicament sont indiqués de façon variable dans les cas authentiquement résistants. II est préférable d'éviter l'emploi de plus de deux médicaments et dans quelques cas, une réduction des doses de médication peut améliorer le contrôle des crises tout en atténuant les effets secondaires. Une évaluation répétée des patients avec épilepsie irréductible est importante, les facteurs étiologiques et favorisants pouvant rester latents durant de longues périodes. La chirurgie devrait probablement être utilisée plus souvent et plus précocément qu'actuellement pour les patients dont I'épilepsie est médicalement irréductible. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Ein klinischer Vorstoβ in der Behandlung den unbeein fluβbaren Epilepsie Die Therapieresistenz von Krampfänfallen auf Antiepileptika ist eher durch Fehler des Patienten (unausgeglichener Lebensstil, fehlende Compliance) oder durch Fehler in der Diagnose oder Therapie des Arztes bedingt, als daß es sich wirklich um eine unbeeinflußbare Epilepsie handelt. Bei wirklich resistenten Fällen ist eine Erhöhung der Dosis ohne Rücksicht auf die Blutspiegel, ein Wechsel des Medikamentes oder die Zugabe eines zweiten Präparates wahlweise indiziert. Die Gabe von mehr als zwei Medikamenten sollte besser vermieden werden und in einigen Fällen können reduzierte Medikamentenspiegel die Krampfkontrolle verbessern und gleichzeitig Nebenwirkungen verhindern. Patienten mit unbeeinflußbarer Epilepsie müssen häufig kontrolliert werden, da kausale und provokative Faktoren über lange Zeit verborgen bleiben können. Patienten mitmedikamentös unbeeinflußbarer Epilepsie sollten häufiger und früher operativ behandelt werden, als es zur Zeit geschieht. RESUMEN Aproximación clínica al tratamiento de la epilepsia intratable La resistencia de las crisis a la terapéutica antiepiléptica puede deberse a un fallo en el paciente (tipo de vida errático falta de complianza) o a errores del médico en el diagnóstico o el tratamiento, más bien que se trate realmente de una epilepsia intratable. El aumento en la dosificación del fármaco, independientemente de los dosajes en sangre, un cambio en la medicación o la adición de un segundo fármaco es lo que suele indicarse en los casos verdaderamente resistentes. Es mejor evitar el uso de dos fármacos y en ocasiones la reductión de los niveles de fármaco puede mejorar el control de las crisis disminuyéndose los efectos secundarios. La evaluación repetida de los pacientes con epilepsias intratables es importante, puesto que los factores causales y los desencadenantes pueden permanecer latentes durante mucho tiempo. Es probable que la cirugía debiera usarse con mayor frecuencia y más tempranamente de lo que lo es ahora en los pacientes cuya epilepsia es médicamente intratable.",

      "title": "Migraine in Children",
      "abstract": "Up to 1 in 10 children will develop migraines, and their symptoms may not resemble the migraines that their parents and other adults experience. Migraine is the most common recurring headache type that occurs in children. Children may be less able to describe the symptoms they are having in terms that adults understand. For example, children may be irritable, start vomiting, and hold their heads, without using the word “headache.” There may be frequent absences from school for stomach issues and not wanting to get up for school, without a clear description of pain. Abdominal pain is a common migraine symptom in children, not usually seen in adult migraineurs. Children with migraine often get complete relief of their migraine with sleep or by a single episode of vomiting. The criteria for migraine diagnosis, outlined by the most recent International Classification of Headache Disorders (3rd Ed. Beta version) states that children's migraines can have a duration of only 2 hours, unlike the adult migraine, which must last at least 4 hours. As with adult migraine, migraine attacks can last up to 3 days. Both children and adults need to have at least 5 attacks, meeting at least 2 of the following 4 criteria: one-sided (more often bilateral in children), pulsating or throbbing pain, moderate to severe intensity, and worsened by routine activity. In addition, migraines in both children and adults must have either light and sound sensitivity, or nausea or vomiting. In children, these symptoms may be inferred by their behavior. Treatment in children often starts with the mildest of interventions, and only when and if these are ineffective, prescription medications specific to migraine are started. It can be helpful to mark on a calendar the days each month that a child has migraine to help determine triggers for when they occur. For example, it might be seen that the headaches are triggered by lack of sleep, and setting up a structured bedtime with adequate rest can be useful. Regular meal times and stress management can be helpful. A headache diary identifying the frequency, severity, and factors that seem to trigger or relieve headaches in a child can make the visit to a headache treating provider more valuable. When medication is found to be necessary, typically acetaminophen 10-20 mg/kg is the first tried. If this appears ineffective, ibuprofen at 10 mg/kg is often the next step. This dose may be repeated in 4-6 hours if needed. If the child is vomiting, rectal promethazine at 0.25-0.5 mg/kg may be used. This can help the child sleep, as well as help with migraine-associated nausea and vomiting. Promethazine can also be given in pill form for nausea without vomiting. Often, as the child approaches adolescence, these over-the-counter medications become less effective, and a migraine-specific medication may be started. The onset of menstruation is a major risk factor for migraine onset or worsening, so adolescent migraine is common, and the headaches tend to be worse before and during the menstrual period. The class of migraine prescription treatment most commonly initiated after the over-the-counter options have failed resembles those frequently used in adult migraineurs. Triptans, specifically formulated for treatment of migraine, target the brain's pain receptors activated in migraine attacks. Rizatriptan is the only FDA approved triptan for all children ages 6-17. Smaller children weighing 20-39 kg are approved for lower dose rizatriptan at 5 mg. Almotriptan is FDA approved for children 12-17. Sumatriptan–naproxen is a single tablet that combines a triptan with naproxen sodium, an anti-inflammatory similar to ibuprofen, and it is FDA approved for 12-17 year olds. No form of sumatriptan other than the combination with naproxen sodium is FDA approved for children. Sumatriptan is often prescribed in children, however, starting with the oral 25 mg dose, and then increasing the dose as the child ages into adulthood, where the typical dose is 100 mg. Triptan nasal sprays may be particularly helpful for the child who is vomiting with their attacks, although many children will not agree to this formulation or tolerate it. Zolmitriptan nasal spray is FDA approved for children 12 and older. Sumatriptan nasal spray is approved for adolescents in the European Union, but is not US FDA approved in children. It is important to note that sumatriptan nasal spray is the only nasal spray rated with Class I Level A evidence for adolescents by the American Academy of Neurology Evidence-Based Guidelines. Zolmitriptan comes in tablet, melt form, and nasal spray, making it a versatile option for those who sometimes vomit with their migraines. However, as noted, only the nasal spray formulation is FDA approved for children 12 years and older. The 5 mg dose is generally used. The zolmitriptan nasal spray does not taste as bad as the sumatriptan nasal spray. The zolmitriptan tablet is only approved for adults 18 years and older. What happens when the headache calendar shows headaches occurring very frequently? First, identifying triggers and avoiding those if at all possible is recommended. Getting a good night's sleep, regular meals, and a healthy diet can go a long way toward helping. Behavioral and non-drug therapies are often very helpful in children and can be used before medications. If the headaches remain frequent, prevention with a medication may be recommended to avoid medication overuse or missing out on too many activities with school and friends. Medication overuse can occur in children as well as adults, and lead to more headaches that are harder to treat. A rule of thumb is that if as-needed medications are being used more than 2 days a week or 10 days per month, they can actually increase headache frequency. This is also when preventive medications may be considered. Low side-effect prevention medications are usually started first. Clear evidence that these are effective in children and adolescents has not yet been found, and therefore keeping a calendar of headache frequency before and while taking them is particularly important to see if they work for a child. It is important to state the there are no prescription medications that are FDA approved for pediatric migraine prevention other than topiramate, which is only approved in those 12-17 years old. A recent study in children and adolescents taking the standard migraine preventive medications, topiramate or amitriptyline, found them to be no more effective than taking placebo (not active) pill over a 6-month time period. However, there may have been problems with this study, and these medications are still widely used in children for migraine prevention. Before medications, or with medications, non-drug, or what is called an interdisciplinary approach of a structured schedule, sleep, and mealtimes, exercise, relaxation, and non-drug pain management strategies are often the first line preventive strategies. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) can be especially effective in children and adolescents. If preventive medications are needed, often low side effect supplements are considered, although the evidence for their effectiveness is not strong in children. Magnesium, riboflavin, and CoenzymeQ10 (CoQ10) are examples. If no benefit is seen with supplements, topiramate may be started. It is started at a low dose and slowly increased. Doses greater than 100 mg should be avoided for migraine prevention because of the increased risk of side effects. It is important to keep an eye out for problems with schoolwork, memory, appetite, and mood when taking this medication, as side effects are not uncommon. Other preventive medications commonly used in children but not FDA approved include blood pressure medications such as beta blockers (propranolol) and antidepressant medications such as amitriptyline and nortriptyline. Beta blockers can lead to a low blood pressure or difficulty with athletic stamina. The antidepressant medications can lead to undesirable mood changes, fatigue, and weight gain in some children. Cyproheptadine, an antihistamine, has also been used in children for migraine prevention. It can be helpful for sleep, but it too can lead to weight gain. Ultimately, the goals of migraine treatment are to normalize a child's life such that they do the activities typical for their age without migraines getting in the way. Medications should help, not hinder, this process. Using a minimum of medications, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle with excellent diet, exercise, and rest go a long way toward helping the child with migraine meet these goals. Deborah E.

Weight loss may result from decreased caloric intake, increased metabolism, or urinary or fecal loss of calories. A variety of general medical, gastrointestinal (GI), and behavioral illnesses produce unexplained weight loss. Depression is the most common behavioral disorder that decreases food intake and is characterized by mood changes, sleep disruption, anhedonia, and low self-esteem. Eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, are distinguished by the patient's desire to maintain thinness and an altered body image. Specific therapies are available for many organic diseases that cause weight loss. Medical and psychological management of behavioral disease should be initiated immediately along with any refeeding program. Therapies that have been efficacious for carefully selected patients with eating disorders include individual psychotherapy, interpersonal therapy, family therapy, and cognitive behavioral therapy.",

      "abstract": "Velopharyngeal dysfunction (VPD) refers to any situation in which an individual is unable to completely close the nasal airway during speech.The velopharyngeal mechanism is comprised of a complex group of structures that act in unison to control airflow through the nose and mouth by elevation of the soft palate and constriction of both the lateral and posterior pharyngeal walls (►Fig. 1).Any disruption in this mechanism may result in abnormal, poorly intelligible speech.VPD can manifest as hypernasality, nasal emission, decreased vocal intensity, and/or facial grimacing. 1Moreover, patients who suffer from VPD will frequently develop maladaptive articulations to compensate for their speech difficulties. 2umerous etiologies can be responsible for this failure of normal speech production.Myoneurogenic problems can impair muscle control or affect muscle programming.Anatomic irregularities can present as a tissue deficit, structural problems that affect function, or even mechanical interference preventing normal closure.Mislearning comprises a host of etiologies whereby the patient has developed abnormal usage of the velopharyngeal mechanism despite the absence of other pathology. 3elopharyngeal dysfunction is a carefully chosen term that simply denotes the presence of incomplete velopharyngeal closure without making suggestions as to its cause.Use of this nomenclature has gained increasing favor by experts, replacing the previous designation, velopharyngeal insufficiency (VPI).This helps to avoid confusion, as VPI has been differentially interpreted as denoting insufficiency, incompetence, and inadequacy-terms that may be similar, but are not synonymous and potentially implicate the cause of the dysfunction rather than describe the clinical finding.VPD is seen in roughly 20 to 30% of individuals who have undergone cleft palate repair, 4,5 and 5 to 10% of patients with a submucous cleft palate (SMCP). 6",

      "abstract": "Generalized anxiety disorder is one of the most common mental disorders. Up to 20% of adults are affected by anxiety disorders each year. Generalized anxiety disorder produces fear, worry, and a constant feeling of being overwhelmed. Generalized anxiety disorder is characterized by persistent, excessive, and unrealistic worry about everyday things. This worry could be multifocal such as finance, family, health, and the future. It is excessive, difficult to control, and is often accompanied by many non-specific psychological and physical symptoms. Excessive worry is the central feature of generalized anxiety disorder.Diagnostic criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM-V) include the following: Excessive anxiety and worry for at least six months Difficulty controlling the worrying. The anxiety is associated with three or more of the below symptoms for at least 6 months: Restlessness, feeling keyed up or on edge Being easily fatigued Difficulty in concentrating or mind going blank, irritability Muscle tension Sleep disturbance Irritability The anxiety results in significant distress or impairment in social and occupational areas The anxiety is not attributable to any physical cause",

Parasomnias are classified according to the type of sleep in which they occur, namely non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep parasomnias (1). The first includes disorders of arousals, namely confusional arousals (and their recently identified variants of sleep-related abnormal sexual behaviors), sleep terrors, and sleepwalking. REM sleep parasomnias include REM sleep behavior disorder, recurrent isolated sleep paralysis, and nightmare disorders. Other parasomnias include sleep enuresis, sleep-related groaning, exploding head syndrome, sleep-related hallucinations, and sleep-related eating disorder. The latter shares many features with the disorders of arousals, being frequently associated to sleepwalking. Hence, parasomnias comprise a variety of abnormal sleep-related movements, behaviors, emotions, dreaming, and autonomic phenomena that emerge from sleep as an expression of an anomalous central nervous system activation during sleep.",

      "title": "Zolpidem Extended-Release: A Single Insomnia Treatment Option for Sleep Induction and Sleep Maintenance Symptoms",
      "abstract": "It is imperative that primary care clinicians have a thorough understanding of insomnia, because they are often the first point of contact for patients who seek assistance when they have difficulty sleeping. Insomnia may appear with different presentations: sleep onset, sleep maintenances, sleep offset, nonrestorative sleep, or a combination of these symptoms. Untreated symptoms result in clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of following-day functionality. Physicians, pharmacists, and other clinicians should be aware of the conditions that contribute to, are antecedent to, and associated with insomnia. These pathophysiological conditions include advanced age; female gender; respiratory, gastrointestinal, vascular, and rheumatologic pain syndromes; and other conditions such as depression and/or anxiety. Additional health factors contributing to insomnia include chronic pain, stressors, grief reaction, pharmacotherapeutic side effects, lifestyle contributors such as social/recreational drugs, phytopharmaceuticals, and ethanol use. The pharmacotherapy focus in this article is a modified-release formulation of the BZ1 (omega1) receptor agonist zolpidem, zolpidem extended-release. Pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and safety studies that compare 12.5 mg zolpidem extended-release (Ambien CR™CIV) and 10 mg original zolpidem were initially conducted in healthy volunteers to assess the potential for an improved clinical profile. Zolpidem extended-release (12.5 mg and 6.25 mg extended-release dosage forms) is indicated for the treatment of insomnia characterized by difficulties with sleep onset and/or sleep maintenance. Zolpidem extended-release is devoid of any short-term use limitation and can be prescribed for the duration of medical necessity. The modified-release zolpidem is a two-layer tablet with a biphasic release profile, releasing the first layer immediately, whereas the second layer is released at a slower rate. Plasma concentrations are maintained for a longer period of time versus the immediate-release zolpidem formulation. Pharmacokinetic analysis has also demonstrated that the time to maximum concentration (tmax) and terminal elimination half-life (t1/2) of 12.5 mg zolpidem extended-release are similar to those of 10 mg zolpidem indicating a similar rapid onset of action and an elimination profile that reduced the risk of next-day decrements in performance. Zolpidem's CYP 450 hepatic metabolism uses as a substrate CYP3A4 (major) and 1A2, 2C9, 2C19, and 2D6 as minor pathways. Zolpidem extended-release dosage forms diminish sleep latency, number of awakenings, and wakefulness after sleep onset and augments total time asleep.",

Multiple studies have reported drug-induced RLS caused by antipsychotics, antidepressants and antiepileptic medications. Risk factors for drug-induced RLS include older age, gastrointestinal diseases, high medication dose, simultaneous use of ≥2 drugs. The mechanism of drug-induced RLS is most often associated with the effect of medications on various receptors and neurotransmitter systems, in particular, the dopamine system. Drug-induced RLS treatment includes identification and withdrawal of a drug that caused RLS or a decrease in its dosage. Prevention of drug-induced RLS is based on compliance with the principles of rational pharmacotherapy.Синдром беспокойных ног (СБН) — сенсомоторное расстройство, которое характеризуется движением ног во время периодов отдыха или бездействия, облегчается при движении и наиболее ярко проявляется вечером или ночью. Имеется много сообщений о лекарственно-индуцированном СБН (ЛИСБН), который наиболее часто вызывают антипсихотические средства, антидепрессанты и противоэпилептические препараты. К факторам риска развития ЛИСБН относят пожилой возраст, курение, злоупотребление кофеином и алкоголем, заболевания желудочно-кишечного тракта, высокие дозы препаратов, одновременное применение двух препаратов и более. Механизм развития ЛИСБН связывается с действием лекарственных средств на различные рецепторы и нейромедиаторные системы, особенно дофаминергические. Лечение ЛИСБН предполагает прежде всего отмену лекарственного средства или, если она невозможна, снижение его дозы.

The treatment of the child neurosis consists of 3 stages: 1. We must make clear to the child ( in the language of his age) and to the educator the dynamic connection between the symptoms and the empirically established play deficiency, in order to eliminate the inhibitory and misleading disease consciousness (liberation moment). 2. Next we have to organize systematically the life of the child according to his individual play urge, in order to get rid of the sickening play deficiency (\"scheduling the day\" moment). 3. Having effected the cure, it is necessary to supervise the child for some time by means of periodic checkups, in order to prevent possible relapse which might result from \"residual play sensitiveness\" (\"weaning\" moment).",

      "abstract": "Monosymptomatic enuresis(bed-wetting without other symptoms) is a common problem in children, affecting 15% of five-year-olds and occurring more frequently in boys than in girls. Because it is usually caused by a physiologic maturational delay, the prevalence decreases with age. Children with enuresis have a small bladder capacity. Failure to awake to the micturition urge is not necessarily related to being a \"deep sleeper\", and children with enuresis may pass urine involuntarily because of the immature central nervous pathways. As the CNS pathways matures with age, most children are more easily aroused from sleep. There is strong evidence of a genetic predisposition for enuresis. Children with enuresis must be evaluated to reveal any underlying physiologic conditions or disease states, such as urinary tract infection or structural abnormality. Once these are ruled out, the goal is to stop the bed-wetting while preserving the child's self-esteem. However, before treatment of enuresis, concurrent problems, such as daytime enuresis and urgency or chronic constipation, should be managed. For the treatment of enuresis, the child wears a moisture alarm-a small, portable, transistorized device-to bed. The alarm sounds or vibrates when wet, awakening the child. Drug therapy for enuresis includes desmopressin, which decreases the urine volume, and imipramine and oxybutynin, which inhibit bladder contraction. Both delayed urinary control and current enuresis are associated with a markedly increased risk of behavioral, emotional, and academic problems.",

      "abstract": "Sleep is a physiologic state that performs an essential restorative function and facilitates learning and memory consolidation. When sleep is disrupted for more than a short time, normal daily functions decline. Mood, attention, and behavior deteriorate. Sleepiness and disrupted sleep can result from a large number of pathological disorders. Currently, 88 sleep disorders are listed in the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, as established by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, and sleep disorders adversely affect more than an estimated 70 million Americans. Most of these disorders can be classified as causing insomnia and/or hypersomnia. Insomnia results from disorders that cause difficulty with falling asleep and staying asleep; examples are hyperarousal, circadian dysrhythmia, and homeostatic dysregulation. In contrast, hypersomnia refers to difficulty in staying awake and is characterized by recurrent episodes of excessive daytime sleepiness or prolonged nighttime sleep. Hypersomnia can result from several primary sleep disorders, including narcolepsy, sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, idiopathic hypersomnia, and periodic limb movement disorder. The effects of some of these sleep disorders and other chronic illnesses on daytime sleepiness are measured using the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. Narcolepsy was found to cause some of the highest measures of excessive sleepiness. This supplement uses a case-based approach to describe the underlying pathology and symptoms of narcolepsy. Differential diagnosis of narcolepsy and current treatment options will be discussed.",

      "abstract": "Saher (Insomnia) or sleeplessness is a sleep disorder in which there is an inability to fall asleep or to stay asleep or both, as long as desire. According to current researches, it has been noted that many people all over the world are suffering from one or more symptoms of insomnia. Depending on duration of problem, it may be classified as transient insomnia, short term insomnia and chronic insomnia. Insomnia is described as saher in ancient classical Unani literature. The causes of insomnia are stress, depression, anxiety, medical conditions, drugs, irregular schedule, caffeine, etc. According to Unani system of medicine, health is attributed to the equilibrium of Akhlat (Humors), beside this, there is Asbab sitta zarooriya (Six essential factors) there are air, food and drinks, bodily movement and repose (Harkat sukoon badni), mental activity and repose, (Harkat wa sukoon nafsani), sleep and wakefulness (Naumwayaqza) and retention and excretion (Ahtabas wa Istefrag); any imbalance any of the above factors is likely to cause the disease. Normal sleep is thought to be because of rutubat wa broodat i.e., wetness and cold in our body, and if there is derailment of balance in sleep and wakefulness, it implies the predominance of yaboosat wa hararat i.e. dryness and hotness extensive in the brain. Dalak (Massage) is a systematic manipulation of body tissues with the hand. Several varieties of dalak have been recommended in Unani system of medicine, e.g., Dalak e sulb (hard) Dalak e layyan (soft), etc. Keywords: Dalak, sahar, insomnia, regimental therapy Cite this Article Moteseem Ahemad, Patel Mohd.

      "abstract": "espanolEl trastorno bipolar es un trastorno mental grave y recurrente de caracter cronico que se caracteriza por oscilaciones del estado de animo con fases de mania, hipomania o mixtas alternadas con episodios depresivos. La prevalencia a lo largo de la vida se estima entre el 1 y 3%, siendo la edad media de debut entre los 18 y 20 anos. Los factores estresantes psicosociales influyen en el comienzo y en las posteriores recidivas dentro de un modelo de vulnerabilidad genetica. Entre los acontecimientos vitales que pueden influir notablemente en el curso de la enfermedad se situan el embarazo y el parto. Son periodos de vulnerabilidad en los que puede acontecer un empeoramiento de los sintomas o incluso una recaida a pesar de existir una buena adherencia terapeutica. El riesgo de recurrencias se incrementa cuando los psicofarmacos se retiran bruscamente. De hecho, hasta un 81-85’5% de gestantes con trastorno bipolar tienen el riesgo de recaer si dejan de tomar estabilizantes del animo. La exposicion al litio durante el primer trimestre se ha relacionado con malformaciones cardiacas en el feto, especialmente la anomalia de Ebstein. El acido valproico y la carbamazepina aumentan el riesgo de defectos en el tubo neural. En cambio, la lamotrigina en monoterapia ha demostrado menor riesgo de malformaciones que otros anticonvulsivantes. Por todo ello, es fundamental valorar el riesgo-beneficio del uso de psicofarmacos, siendo necesario el conocimiento de su uso y elaborar un plan de tratamiento individualizado en cada caso. EnglishBipolar disorder is a recurring and chronic severe mental disorder consisting of mood shifts between manic, hypomanic or mixed phases alternated with depressive episodes. Lifetime prevalence is estimated between 1 and 3%, mean age of debut being between 18 and 20 years of age. Psychosocial stressors influence the onset and subsequent relapses within a model of genetic vulnerability. Among the vital events that can significantly influence the course of the disorder are pregnancy and childbirth. They are periods of vulnerability in which there can be a worsening of symptoms or even a relapse despite having a good therapeutic adherence. The risk of recurrence is increased when psychoactive drugs are withdrawn abruptly; in fact up to 81-85.5% of pregnant women with bipolar disorder have the risk of relapse if they stop taking mood stabilizers. Exposure to lithium during the first trimester has been linked to cardiac malformations in the fetus, especially Ebstein’s anomaly. Valproic acid and carbamazepine increase the risk of neural tube defects. Lamotrigine monotherapy has shown a lower risk of malformations than other anticonvulsants. It is essential to assess the risks and benefits of the use of psychotropic drugs, the knowledge of their use is necessary as is the elaboration of an individualized treatment plan in each case",

      "abstract": "Pharmacological concerns need epidemiological elucidation\n\nPatients with depressive disorders could be more liable to accidents than others for several reasons. These include impaired attention and concentration (often due to preoccupation with morbid or worrying thoughts); anxiety, which usually accompanies depression; irritability; agitation or retardation; fatigue after sleepless nights; and weakness due to insufficient food intake. In addition, depressed patients may take risks with little regard to the consequences, make suicidal gestures or attempts that go wrong, and take alcohol or other substances that impair functioning to relieve distress. In keeping with these considerations are the reductions in performance in tests of cognitive and psychomotor function in depressed patients.1\n\nIf depression causes or contributes to accidents in these ways then therisk of accidents might be expected to fall as the disorder improves in response to treatment with antidepressant drugs (or other treatment). On the other hand, the unwanted effects of antidepressants may adversely affect cognitive and psychomotor function (especially in those with pre-existing cerebral impairment), thereby increasing the risk of accidents. This is particularly the case in patients who do not respond to treatment and thus are impaired by both the depression and the drug. Drug induced effects may be clinically obvious, with, for example, somnolence due to oversedation; mild effects may be evident only on formal psychometric testing.

      "title": "Food addiction: A perspective",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Food addiction (FA) refers to an excessive and dysregulated consumption of high-calorie foods that are hyperpalatable. Although it does not feature in the current classificatory systems of psychiatric disorders, it has gained prominence as a result of the obesity pandemic. It shares many features with addictive disorders and eating disorders such as binge eating disorder and bulimia nervosa. Changes in the brain–gut–microbiome interactions, genetic polymorphisms (dopamine, opioid, leptin, and melanocortin-4 receptor), and altered connectivity in various brain circuits are some of the etiological factors for the development of FA. Depression, anxiety, emotional dysregulation, impaired decision-making, high impulsivity and neuroticism, lower conscientiousness, and extraversion are some of the risk factors for FA. When confronted with excess stress or burnout, predisposed individuals consume food for comfort-seeking and to avoid unpleasant emotions placing them at a greater risk of FA. Lifestyle modification, cognitive behavior therapy, pharmacotherapy, cognitive training, psychobiotics, low carbohydrate ketogenic therapy, self-help groups, virtual reality, and neuromodulation techniques can be incorporated into the management of FA. Unless FA and its comorbidities are identified and managed appropriately, it will impede weight loss, and the results of interventions for the management of obesity will not be sustained. Preventive strategies include early identification and management of at-risk adolescents, incorporating programs promoting healthy food choices and eating habits, and more regulation of pleasurable foods in child and youth settings. The onus of taking responsibility to implement measures to curb FA lies with the food industry, governments through statutory regulations, and the society at large.",

      "title": "Substance Use Disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract Addiction occurs when repeated use of drugs changes how a person’s brain functions over time. The transition from voluntary to compulsive drug use reflects changes in the brain’s natural inhibition and reward centers that keep a person from exerting control over the impulse to use drugs even when there are negative consequences—the defining characteristic of addiction. Many adolescent risk factors, including genetic vulnerability, prenatal exposure to alcohol or other drugs, lack of parental supervision or monitoring, a history of physical and/or sexual abuse, and an association with drug-using peers are risk factors that contribute to a greater likelihood of being diagnosed with a substance use disorder. On average, adolescents tend to show a reduction in use following treatment, but post-treatment course is variable. Aftercare helps to maintain treatment gains, and more than one episode of treatment may be needed for some adolescents with more severe substance involvement.",

      "title": "Obstructive Sleep Apnea-Hypopnea Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) is characterized by recurrent episodes of partial or complete upper airway collapse during sleep that is highlighted by a reduction in, or complete cessation of, airflow despite documented on going inspiratory efforts. Due to the lack of adequate alveolar ventilation that results from the upper airway narrowing, oxygen saturation may drop and partial pressure of CO2 may occasionally increase. The events are mostly terminated by arousals. Clinical consequences are excessive daytime sleepiness related to the sleep disruption. Minimal diagnostic criteria have been defined for OSAHS. Patients should have excessive daytime sleepiness that can not be better explained by other factors, or experience two or more of the following symptoms, again that are not better explained by other factors: choking or gasping during sleep; recurrent awakenings from sleep; un-refreshing sleep; daytime fatigue; and impaired concentration. All patients should have more than five obstructed breathing events per hour during sleep. An obstructive apnea or hypopnoea can be defined as an event that lasts for ≥ 10 s and is characterized by an absence or a decrease from baseline in the amplitude of a valid measure of breathing during sleep that either reaches >50% with an oxygen desaturation of 3% or an arousal (alternatively a 30% reduction with 4% desaturation). The American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) recommends these definitions. The Task Force of the AASM also states that there are common pathogenic mechanisms for obstructive apnea syndrome, central apnea syndrome, sleep hypoventilation syndrome and Cheyne-Stokes breathing. It was more preferable to discuss each of these separately; although, they could be placed under the common denominator of \"sleep-disordered breathing syndrome\". The definition of OSAHS using two components, daytime symptoms and breathing pattern disturbances during sleep, may suggest that there is a tight correlation between the two. However, unfortunately this is not the case. The breathing pattern abnormalities, mostly described by an Apnea/Hypopnoea Index (AHI), only weakly correlate with quantified measures of sleepiness, such as the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). This probably means that interindividual sensitivity, with some individuals coping better with sleep fragmentation than others, does compromise the relationship between the AHI and daytime sleepiness scores. In addition, epidemiological studies show a broad range of sleepiness in the general population. Obviously, epidemiological studies investigating the prevalence of OSAHS are all biased by the lack of a uniform definition. The prevalence of an AHI of >5 events · h-1 in a general population (without taking into account symptoms of sleepiness) has previously been estimated to be 24% in a male population. When symptoms of sleepiness were also taken into account, the prevalence decreased to 4% in males and 2% in females.",

      "abstract": "In the older population, one of the serious health concerns that are associated with comorbidity, impaired functioning, excessive use of health care resources, and increased mortality (including suicide) is a depressive disorder. Depression that occurs among individuals greater than or equal to 65 years with no previous history of depression is known as late-life depression, which is characterized as the affective state of sadness that occurs as a response to various of human situations including loss of a loved one, failing to achieve goals, or disappointment in love relationships. Major depression differs only in the intensity and duration or quality of the emotional state. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) defines major depressive disorder by the presence of depressed mood or a marked loss of interest or pleasure in activities along with 5 or more of the following associated symptoms: changes in appetite or weight (5% of the total body weight), sleep, energy, concentration, and psychomotor activity, feelings of inappropriate guilt or worthlessness and recurrent thoughts of death or suicide. There should be an impairment in social, occupational, and other areas of functioning.The symptoms of depression should have been present during the last two weeks. Depression in late-life is underdiagnosed and inadequately treated. It is a serious and life-threatening disorder which affects every 1 in 5 individual in a lifetime. When it occurs in old age, it becomes challenging to distinguish it from dementia, as both these diagnoses have overlapping symptom profiles, especially when depression affects the cognition and is presented as ’pseudodementia.’",

This is non-progressive and is correlated in its severity with the frequency of seizures. Accompanying EEG discharges are often localized to rolandic areas that cortically represent oral movements and salivation. We report a 6-year-old male and a 6 1/2-year-old female with progressive bulbar dysfunction resulting from epilepsy. Ictal EEGs in patient 1 did not confirm a diagnosis of epilepsy. With no evidence of a cortical or brainstem focus from EEG or MRI, it is very difficult to explain the mechanism of bulbar dysfunction. The complete restoration of bulbar function after treatment with antiepileptic drugs demonstrates the need to consider epilepsy in similar clinical situations.",

The prevalence of LD in the general population has been found to be 2–10% and reading disorders are the most frequent subtype. Epilepsy is one of the commonest neurological disorders in childhood with an estimated prevalence in 4–5/1,000. Epilepsy is considered to be idiopathic or cryptogenic in approximately two‐thirds of cases. LD are more common in people with epilepsy than in the general population: about 25% of patients with epilepsy are said to have LD. Various psychosocial, medication‐related, and epilepsy‐related factors may be associated with LD in epilepsy. LD can be either permanent or state‐dependent. Permanent LD are caused by a brain lesion and/or a stable brain dysfunction. In contrast, state‐dependent LD are potentially reversible and treatable; they are caused by epilepsy‐related factors. If allowed to persist for a long period, a state‐dependent LD may become permanent.",

      "abstract": "In asthma, paralysis does not occur after a loading dose; if it did, it might be catastrophic!Why should the same dose paralyse the patient with convulsions?Basic pharmacokinetics suggest that it should not; a bolus of, for example, 8mmol of magnesium given over 5 min, will initially distribute over the serum volume of approximately 3 1, resulting in a maximal serum concentration of 2.7 mmol.1-'.Clinically significant inhibition at the neuromuscular junction, however, requireslevels above 5 mmol.1-'[3] (in the absence of other neuromuscular blockers).Noppen et al. [2] observed a magnesium level of 19.5 mmol.1-' after the administration of approximately 12 mmol over 20 min.Magnesium deficiency is known to lower the seizure threshold and, on occasion, can cause intractable seizures [4].The proconvulsive effect of magnesium depletion is so reliable that it has become a popular technique to generate animal and tissue models of seizure activity.Various clinical conditions are associated with magnesium depletion, for example the alcohol withdrawal syndrome, where a pre-existing deficit is complicated by a further decrease in the serum level.The magnitude of this reduction correlates with the severity of symptoms [5], which include grand ma1 seizures and status epilepticus.However, even without prior depletion, magnesium appears to exert a true anticonvulsant effect.Although some animal experiments, like the pentylenetetrazole model [6] quoted by Walker et al., did not show a therapeutic effect, there were others that did and were not mentioned by Dr Walker and colleagues.Recently, Cotton et al. [7] showed a reduction of the electroencephalographic amplitude and duration of seizures in rats given magnesium intraperitoneally.This anticonvulsant effect can, in part, be explained by the physiological interaction of magnesium with the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor: evidence is accumulating that the NMDA receptor contributes to epileptogenesis [%I, whilst it is well known that magnesium blocks the open channel of the NMDA receptor in a voltage dependent fashion [9].The NMDA receptor is also implicated in secondary neuronal damage after traumatic and hypoxic brain insults.Animal experiments suggest that in both conditions, magnesium may protect the brain against secondary damage mediated via the excitatory amino acids and the NMDA receptor [lo, 111.This, I suggest, could also be relevant to the neuronal loss occurring in human prolonged status epilepticus.My interpretation of the available data is that it would be worthwhile to explore magnesium's role in the treatment of status epilepticus in controlled trials, rather than to perpetuate prejudices that are not supported by evidence.",

      "abstract": "monitoring in patients with dysphagia, non-cardiac chest pain or heartburn in Japan, too. It is also important to perform the examination in the same way as occidentals do and to compare our results with theirs. As there is confusion about the criteria for the definition and name of these disorders in Japan, it may be necessary to define these relatively new clinical concepts as follows. Functional disorders of the esophagus are defined as the disorders of the esophagus that are not derived from organic diseases such as malignant or benign tumor, diverticulum or stricture. Since the function of the esophagus is to transport material from the mouth to the stomach, functional disorders are related to disturbance of motility. They are classified as primary or secondary. Primary functional disorders may be subdivided into the three anatomical regions: upper, middle, and lower esophagus. Neuromuscular diseases cause motility disorders in the pharyngeal region, diffuse esophageal spasm (DES), nutcracker esophagus (high amplitude peristalsis), which is a disorder of the esophageal body, and achalasia or hypercontracting sphincter, a dysfunction of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). Secondary functional disorders include motility disorders derived from gastroesophageal reflux (GER) or collagen vascular diseases. To make a precise diagnosis of functional esophageal disorders, specific diagnostic tests are required in addition to a detailed history and physical examination. In practice, these include video roentgenographic barium studies and endoscopy, esophageal manometry, 24-hour pH monitoring, and sometimes ambulatory esophageal motility. Manometry may be performed using a perfused multi-lumen catheter connected to a pneumohydraulic capillary infusion pump. The amplitude, duration, propagation, and efficiency of contractions in the esophageal body as well as the incidence of abnormal contractions may be recorded manually or by a computer. The location, length, pressure, and percentage relaxation of the LES are recorded. The purpose of manometry is twofold: first, to record esophageal motor",

Because any serious disease can cause growth failure, the term FTT has little diagnostic usefulness. Classically, the etiology of FTT has been divided into organic and nonorganic types, with nonorganic FTT defined as growth deficiency without a diagnosable medical etiology and organic FTT defined as growth failure caused by a specific medical illness. A number of authors have questioned the adequacy of this dichotomous view, suggesting the need for a third category: \"mixed\" etiology. In this group of children, chronic, mild problems, such as recurrent otitis media in concert with behavioral problems, result in aberrant behaviors, such as difficult temperament, sleep disorders, and altered eating behavior, which together impair growth. Even in cases in which the growth deficiency is primarily due to organic or nonorganic causes, the problems seen in the children are often multiple (eg, infants who have cardiac failure also have feeding disorders). Given the multiple contributory factors to FTT and the lack of diagnostic specificity of the term, we recommend that it be abandoned in favor of the term \"growth deficiency,\" which describes the presentation of this entity: An underweight, often stunted, undernourished child.",

      "title": "Irritable bowel syndrome and functional dyspepsia: different diseases or a single disorder with different manifestations?",
      "abstract": "Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) are common, chronic ailments that affect millions of adults on a daily basis. FGIDs are characterized by recurrent symptoms (ie, abdominal pain or discomfort, bloating, nausea, vomiting, early satiety, constipation, or diarrhea) that indicate a dysfunctional GI tract despite that an organic reason for the symptom generation is not identified on diagnostic studies.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that 40% of all gastroenterology clinic visits are for FGIDs,[1] and a recent survey of generalists and gastroenterologists found that nearly one third of their patient population had symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).[2] Many patients with IBS have dyspepsia; likewise, many patients with dyspepsia also have overlapping symptoms of IBS. These 2 groups of patients are similar in that symptoms are typically chronic in nature, may wax and wane, are aggravated by psychosocial stressors, and are often worsened by meals. In addition, both disorders are considered difficult to diagnose by many physicians and in the absence of warning signs or “red flags,” extensive testing is unlikely to be helpful. These similarities raise the issue of whether IBS and dyspepsia are just different manifestations of the same disorder or whether they represent distinct clinical entities. Elucidating this clinical dilemma is important because it may improve our ability to diagnose and treat these common disorders.\r\n\r\nAt present, the ROME II committee classifies IBS as a distinctly separate functional bowel disorder from dyspepsia.[3] IBS is characterized by lower abdominal pain or discomfort in association with disordered defecation (Table 1). Dyspepsia presents as recurrent upper abdominal pain or discomfort associated with symptoms of early satiety, fullness, bloating, and nausea (Table 2). Because upper GI function regularly affects lower GI tract function (ie, the gastro-colic reflex), and lower GI function routinely affects upper GI function (ie, constipation slows gastric emptying), it should not be surprising that these 2 areas are intimately linked.[4]\r\n\r\nTable 1\r\n\r\nRome II Criteria for Irritable Bowel Syndrome[3]",

      "title": "Seizure-like States",
      "abstract": "Seizure-like episodes resemble seizures, but are not true seizures. Breath-holding spells (BHS), tics, syncope, gastroesophageal reflux (GER), and sleep disturbances all may be mistaken for seizures, but important distinguishing features can help the clinician differentiate these entities from a true seizure.Like seizures, seizure-like states are paroxysmal events that have a discrete onset, ending, and return to baseline. The duration, frequency, and clinical characteristics are different for each entity and help the clinician distinguish among them, usually on the basis of history and physical examination, sometimes with the aid of additional diagnostic testing.Seizures are disturbances of the central nervous system characterized by phenomena that the patient cannot control, with or without a concurrent loss of consciousness. There may be major motor manifestations. The range of clinical seizures extends from subtle behavioral arrests (absence seizures) to the more obvious generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Generally, consciousness is lost, and the postictal period of drowsiness or decreased responsiveness following the episode often lasts 21/2 times the length of the actual paroxysm. If the paroxysm is momentary, a postictal period may not be identifiable.BHS are common, peaking in children between 2 and 3 years of age, although even infants may have them. Commonly, those who hold their breath outgrow their spells by 5 or 6 years of age. BHS are characterized by the child’s apparent inability to breathe, accompanied by a change in color, limpness, and collapse, followed briefly by a return to baseline. The duration usually is less than 1 minute. Generalized tonic movements from brief cerebral ischemia may accompany BHS, but do not imply any increased risk of epilepsy in the future. Clinically, BHS can be categorized as pallid or cyanotic. The parents often describe the child as becoming frustrated and crying prior to cyanotic episodes and having suffered minor trauma, sometimes without crying, prior to pallid episodes. The frequency varies, but usually the spells occur a few times in a month. Treatment often is behavioral modification of the parents’ response to such episodes; rarely, atropine-like agents or cardiac pacing may be necessary. Paroxysmal episodes usually are distinguished from seizures by the typical history, although epilepsy monitoring occasionally is used to verify the nonepileptic nature of the events.Syncope, which like many seizures, involves loss of consciousness, can occur with or without a warning. Children may describe a premonitory sensation, with their vision becoming gray or like the “snow” of static on a black and white television. Depending on the severity of the syncopal episode, the child may return to consciousness immediately or after a brief period of time. With longer periods of unconsciousness, abnormal clonic or tonic movements may be seen, making it more difficult to distinguish the episode from a seizure. Most syncopal episodes are either neurogenic or cardiogenic in origin. Neurogenic syncope occurs when activation of the autonomic nervous system causes reflex slowing of the heart, with sinus bradycardia and blood pressure changes. Common triggers of neurogenic syncope include micturition, coughing, swallowing, and vasovagal phenomena. The most common cause of cardiogenic syncope is a conduction defect, resulting in dysrhythmia or arrest. Usually a cardiogenic event occurs suddenly, without any warning. Exercise is one known precipitator of cardiogenic syncope.The duration of syncopal events usually is brief, with prolonged confusion being more likely after a cardiogenic episode. Evaluation includes a physical examination, with measurement of orthostatic blood pressures and 12-lead electrocardiography. The extent of further cardiac evaluation depends on the clinical history; the history most often distinguishes between a seizure and a syncopal event. Electroencephalography (EEG) rarely is revealing in these scenarios.Tics are episodes characterized by repetitive, stereotyped movements involving one or more muscle groups. Simple tics, which occur in as many as 20% of children, most commonly involve muscles of the face and neck, manifesting as eye blinking, facial twitching, shrugging, head turning, sniffing, grunting, or repetitive clearing of the throat. Tics often subside within weeks to months, although they can recur. Children described as having complex tics either have multiple types of tics or tics involving several muscle groups. If complex tics are associated with vocal tics, the child likely has Tourette syndrome, which has an autosomal dominant inheritance with variable penetrance and expression. Any child old enough to understand the question can be asked if he or she can “make them go away.” Both simple and complex tics can be suppressed by the child and often are “released” in a more relaxed, appropriate environment. The episodes, frequently precipitated by stress or excitement, typically are brief, but their frequency varies from several per minute to fairly rarely.Treatment of tics and Tourette syndrome depends on the degree to which the episodes interfere with normal functioning. Clonidine, haloperidol, or risperidone in small doses can reduce episodes, although they rarely abolish tics. Family support and education are crucial in the management of affected children. In most cases, tics and Tourette syndrome can be distinguished from seizures by the history. Usually, the level of consciousness is not altered, and when mild, the movements upset parents more than the child, who typically is oblivious to them unless they cause teasing by peers.GER can manifest, particularly in infants, with paroxysmal episodes that are difficult to distinguish from seizures. At their most severe, such episodes present as apparent life-threatening events, characterized by apnea, color change, and limpness or arching of the back. The paroxysmal episodes frequently are related temporally to feedings and spitting up or vomiting. When severe, the spells can occur with every feeding. The duration usually is brief, and the child returns to baseline. The physical findings are normal, although if the reflux is severe, there may be poor weight gain or other signs of nutritional problems. Seizures can be distinguished from these episodes by history. Thickening feeds, acid-suppressing therapy, and promotility drugs are used when treatment is necessary.Certain sleep disturbances in children can mimic seizures: benign neonatal myoclonus, rhythmic parasomnias, night terrors, and sleepwalking. These paroxysms involve either abnormal movements or abnormal behaviors during sleep. The spells mimic seizures because the level of consciousness is altered or behavior becomes abnormal, with or without abnormal involuntary movements. Benign sleep myoclonus occurs in infancy, beginning either in the first postnatal weeks and being outgrown by 3 to 4 months of age or beginning later in infancy and being outgrown around 2 years of age. Myoclonic jerking of various muscle groups occurs every few seconds during nonrapid eye movement sleep, usually lasting fewer than 3 minutes, but occasionally persisting as long as 30 minutes. If such movements are repetitive in the same muscle groups or are synchronous and repetitive on both sides of the body, they are more likely to be seizures. Rhythmic parasomnias can manifest as repetitive episodes of rhythmic movements of the neck and trunk or legs or may present as body rocking or head banging. There is no associated emotional disturbance. The episodes occur in early (stage 2) sleep. Night terrors typically are described as the child suddenly sitting up and screaming, seeming to be terrified while remaining unresponsive. The duration usually is about 10 minutes, after which the child returns to sleep. The frequency is variable. If awakened, the child is unaware of the event, which occurs in the first 3 hours of sleep during stage 3 or 4 (deep) sleep. There is a familial predisposition.With sleepwalking, a child gets up and walks around in a trance, with eyes open and possibly mumbling incoherently, and then returns to bed. The child can be put back to bed but may become agitated if restrained. On awakening, the child does not recall the event. Sleepwalking occurs in the first 3 hours after sleep onset; typically, episodes begin between 5 and 10 years of age and can persist into adulthood. The duration of an event varies, as does the frequency. Such sleep disturbances most often can be distinguished from seizures by history. Occasionally, epilepsy monitoring may be needed to clarify the diagnosis. None of these entities is associated with EEG changes. If treatment is required, small doses of clonazepam may be used.The recording by the parent (with a camcorder) of any unusual spell can provide valuable information to the clinician attempting to diagnose these puzzling occurrences.Seizures are paroxysmal episodes that need to be distinguished from other events that may mimic them, including BHS, syncope, tics, GER, and sleep disturbances. A clinical history defining the specific characteristics of the event, including duration and frequency, and sometimes a videotape, in conjunction with the physical examination often yield an accurate diagnosis, allowing for appropriate intervention. In rare cases, EEG and epilepsy monitoring can be used to help distinguish among these entities.Comment: Asked once why he robbed banks, Willie Sutton supposedly replied, “That’s where the money is.” Not everything that looks like a seizure is what it appears to be. Telling the difference depends, more than anything else, first on asking the right questions. More than scans and even EEGs, the history is the bank.",

      "title": "Association between chronic insomnia and depression in elderly adults",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is not just a common symptom of various psychiatric or physical disorders, but is itself categorized as a primary psychiatric disorder. Aside from the manifestations of difficulty initiating sleep, fragmented sleep, early-morning wakenings, and overall poor sleep efficiency, the subjective feeling of inadequate or non-restorative sleep the next morning, as well as psychosocial distress or dysfunction caused, are even more crucial in the diagnosis of insomnia.1,2 The duration of insomnia required for diagnosis as “chronic” has varied from as little as 1 month to as long as 6 months, depending upon the criteria used. The increased incidence of chronic insomnia has been related to concomitant medical and psychiatric disorders, which are frequently present among the elderly. When insomnia becomes chronic, it will invariably increase medical problems significantly, and impact a patient's quality of life, cognitive and psychosocial function adversely,1,2 while further exaggerating the already existing psychiatric or medical conditions. Somatic comorbidities associated with aging are known to be risk factors for insomnia and depression. Therefore, chronic insomnia will further aggravate the heavy burden of medically ill elderly patients and their caregivers.3,4 The prevalence of insomnia among the general adult population is approximately 6% to 30%.2,5 Furthermore, an estimated 50% to 70% of all people aged ≥65 years have reported at least one condition of chronic sleep disturbances.4 A study conducted in one district of metropolitan Taipei, Taiwan has shown that nearly half of the elderly reported suffering from insomnia and poor sleep quality, and 22% of elderly subjects used medication for sleep, numbers that are consistent with results of previous studies in other countries.6 In this study, 7% of the elderly have possible depression. The severity of depression has also been found to be a significant factor related to their insomnia and sleep quality.6 Major depressive disorder (MDD) and insomnia are closely and multifacetedly related, and they pose a bidirectional relationship.7 The interplay between these psychopathologies is not fully understood; however, their functional relationship has become a focus of recent investigation.8,9 By using self-rating scales, epidemiological surveys have demonstrated the significant association between chronic insomnia and depression in young adults, as well as in elderly populations.3,9 Insomnia is the major complaint among those patients with MDD, and about 40% to 80% of such patients complained of insomnia, or poor sleep quality. In addition to being a symptom of MDD, insomnia has also been suggested as a primary disorder comorbid with MDD.7 Conversely, depression has been found to be over-represented in individuals with chronic insomnia, and the severity of depression is significantly associated with nonrestorative sleep and decreased total sleep duration.8 The severity and duration of depression will be exaggerated if patient depression is combined with chronic insomnia. Several longitudinal studies have shown that insomnia can be a risk factor of, and a precursor to new-onset depression; it can also increase the likelihood of a recurrence or relapse of MDD episodes in the following years.7,10 The close relationship between insomnia and depression is also observed in the elderly. The insomnic elderly, by a factor of three to seven times, were more likely to develop depression during later years, compared to control subjects who did not suffer from insomnia. Sleep disturbance was also associated with more severe and later onset depression, where elderly patients with depression had longer nocturnal awakenings, poor sleep efficiency, and poor neuro-psychological functioning comparing to the control group.11 Therefore, patients with insomnia should be carefully evaluated for the presence of comorbid depression, which can facilitate the early detection and management of insomnia as a way to reduce the risk of MDD.11 When insomnia is comorbid with MDD, the relative improvement seen in both disorders can be enhanced if they are treated with a hypnotic along with an antidepressant. One survey revealed that a greater rate (21%) of patients with chronic insomnia received antidepressants, compared to those patients (8%) who did not suffer from chronic insomnia.3 Besides depression, sleep problems are also more prevalent in elderly dementia patients than in controls.4 In a cohort group of elderly patients suffering from dementia, about one-third suffered from insomnia, and roughly 20% to 25% reported being affected by sleep-related leg cramps, restless leg syndrome, or rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorders. More than 60% of hospitalized patients with dementia of the Alzheimer-type were observed suffering different sleep disorders.12 These sleep disorders, which occurred at a higher frequencies than in the general elderly population, suggest that neuro-degeneration probably play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of insomnia in the elderly. Among the elderly, sleep disorders were found to be closely associated with depression and anxiety.4 In a postal community survey of adult insomniacs, there has been a reported increase in healthcare use, with the primary reason given as “difficulty in falling asleep.” Correspondingly, “wakes up tired” is the reason often given by insomniacs if insomnia is combined with anxiety or depression.3 About 9% to 26% of those patients with insomnia used sleep medications, which included subjects in the Taiwan survey.5,6,13,14 At present, pharmacological intervention remains the treatment of choice, and the use of hypnotics is significantly associated with elderly female patients with depression-like symptoms, suffering from poor sleep quality and complaining of difficulty falling asleep.5,15 Elderly status and poor sleep control were the strongest predictors for the use of medication, and for subsequent difficulty in quitting sleep medications.15 Both benzodiazepine and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics have been the most frequently used drugs for treating insomnia in the elderly in Taiwan.14 Most of the clinical trials of hypnotics in insomnia are of short duration, and the long-term effects, tolerance, and abuse liability of hypnotics require further study. The potential for abuse liability from these benzodiazepine hypnotics appears to be minimal in the elderly, and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics also may have diminished abuse liability potential as well. In Taiwan, older individuals are less likely to receive a higher dosage benzodiazepine therapy, but more likely to receive more prolonged therapy.13 Furthermore, elderly patients with concomitant anxiety or depression consumed more hypnotics.13 Elderly patients are at risk for a variety of sleep disorders that are most often comorbid with other medical and psychiatric illnesses. Chronic insomnia has a complex relationship with depression, such that sleep disturbance, cognitive decline, and late-onset depression may share common neurobiological underpinnings. In elderly patients with chronic insomnia, the early detection and treatment of depression must be promoted. If insomnia coexists with depression, both symptoms or disorders may be highly associated with the constant use of hypnotics. Therefore, a combined use of antidepressants should be considered for achieving a more satisfactory improvement in elderly patients.

      "abstract": "We previously reported a case of delayed autonomic neuropathy in a patient with diethylene glycol (DEG) poisoning,1 and would like to emphasize two characteristic complications, sensorimotor neuropathy and renal failure, occurring in the same case, because of their severity and possible reversibility. Although once recovered from acute symptoms by day 3, the patient suffered from long-term ventilator dependence (days 11–54), unresponsiveness, and quadriparesis. Despite no remarkable finding on brain magnetic resonance imaging, electroencephalogram, or lumber puncture, a nerve conduction study showed reductions in the amplitudes and conduction velocities of compound muscle and sensory nerve action potentials in the limbs (Table 1). The patient recovered from all neurological symptoms within 2 years of exposure to DEG. Sensorimotor neuropathy from DEG poisoning can be delayed until at least 5–10 days post-ingestion and presents various symptoms including quadriparesis and unresponsiveness.2 The clinical course in severe cases is unpredictable, with long-term resolution in some patients and permanent neurological damage in others.2 In the management of such patients, subsequent close observation is required even after initial recovery. The patient received renal replacement therapy (RRT) for renal failure on day 1–30. Although RRT could be withdrawn in this case, one report showed 90.0% of dialysis-dependent patients from DEG poisoning remained so over time.3 Clinicians should recognize a possible necessity of long-term RRT for such cases. The report of this case was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Tohoku University Graduate School of Medicine (2015-1-668). Conflict of Interest: None declared.",

      "abstract": "The long term development of periodic syndromes among children is little known. Our research has revealed that about one third of periodic headaches, two thirds of cyclic vomiting and half the cases of recurring abdominal pain disappear either before puberty or during adolescence. Other Authors have shown that this also happens in most cases of early-onset vertigo. The remaining headache cases develop into migraines in adults. When there is persistent cyclic vomiting, the collateral neurologic phenomena (headaches, vertigo, pallor, hypotonia, drowsiness) become more intense. This also happens in some cases of abdominal pain and paroxysmal vertigo which start in late childhood. Other sufferers from acute abdominal pain develop ulcers, gastroduodenitis and colitis as adults. Altogether, some infantile periodic syndromes (in particular the multi-symptomatic ones) have a common outcome, i.e. develop into more or less typical migraine syndromes. In these cases one can presume a common pathogenetic mechanism. In those cases where the outcome is favorable the pathogenesis may be different. These cases may often be spotted in early childhood on account of the monosymptomatic nature of the complaint or the absence of collateral neurologic symptoms as well as of the infrequency of critical episodes.",

Seizures starting in the first year of life including the neonatal period might have a favorable course, such as in infants presenting with benign familial neonatal epilepsy, febrile seizures simplex or acute symptomatic seizures. However, in some cases, the onset of seizures at birth or in the first months of life have a dramatic evolution with severe cerebral impairment. Seizure disorders starting in early life include the \"epileptic encephalopathies\", a group of conditions characterized by drug resistant seizures, delayed developmental skills, and intellective disability. This group of disorders includes early infantile epileptic encephalopathy also known as Ohtahara syndrome, early myoclonic encephalopathy, epilepsy of infancy with migrating focal seizures, infantile spasms syndrome (also known as West syndrome), severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy (also known as Dravet syndrome) and, myoclonic encephalopathies in non-progressive disorder. Here we report on seizures manifesting in the first year of life including the neonatal period. Conditions with a benign course, and those with severe evolution are presented. At this early age, clinical identification of seizures, distinction of each of these disorders, type of treatment and prognosis is particularly challenging. The aim of this report is to present the clinical manifestations of each of these disorders and provide an updated review of the conditions associated with seizures in the first year of life.",

Comatose patients normally maintain their eyes closed without evidence of opening spontaneously or to external stimuli, do not follow instructions, do not show goal-directed or voluntary conduct, do not speak and cannot sustain looking or tracking movements of more than a 45˚ angle. Excluded are secondary neurobehavioral signs and symptoms in coma that have been treated pharmacologically with sedatives. The definition of coma in terms of cerebral functioning refers to a state of acute brain failure not strictly related to any particular cerebral substratum or specific anatomical level of lesion. Coma normally occurs when broad areas in the upper and lower brain stems, or cerebral hemispheres, or simultaneously in the cerebral hemispheres and brain stem are damaged. The most frequent causes of coma are diffuse axonal pathology, hypoxia and secondary lesions which affect the brainstem (Figures 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4).",

In FDEIA, both the food allergen/s and exercise are independently tolerated. FDEIA is an uncommon allergic condition in childhood, but nonetheless is an important differential diagnosis to be considered when faced by a child who has experienced exercise‐associated anaphylaxis. The diagnosis of FDEIA is heavily dependent on the clinical history. Allergy tests may need to be performed to a broad panel of food and food additives. Modified exercise challenges (performed with and without prior ingestion of food) are frequently required as allergy test results frequently return low‐positive results. A diagnosis of FDEIA facilitates the safe independent return to exercise and reintroduction of foods for patients who otherwise may unnecessarily avoid exercise and/or restrict their diet. The natural history of FDEIA is unknown; however, a safe return is usually achieved when the ingestion of the causal food allergen/s and exercise are separated.",

      "abstract": "Non‐specific illness includes a wide variety of symptoms: behavioural (e.g., reduced food and water intake), cognitive (e.g., memory and concentration problems) and physiological (e.g., fever). This paper reviews evidence suggesting that such symptoms can be explained more parsimoniously as a single symptom cluster than as a set of separate illnesses such as Gulf War Syndrome (GWS) and chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). This superordinate syndrome could have its biological basis in the activity of pro‐inflammatory cytokines (in particular interleukin‐1: IL‐1), that give rise to what has become known as the ‘sickness response’. It is further argued that the persistence of non‐specific illness in chronic conditions like GWS may be (in part) attributable to a bio‐associative mechanism (Ferguson and Cassaday, 1999). In the case of GWS, physiological challenges could have produced a non‐specific sickness response that became associated with smells (e.g., petrol), coincidentally experienced in the Persian Gulf. On returning to the home environment, these same smells would act as associative triggers for the maintenance of (conditioned) sickness responses. Such associative mechanisms could be mediated through the hypothalamus and limbic system via vagal nerve innervation and would provide an explanation for the persistence of a set of symptoms (e.g., fever) that should normally be short lived and self‐limiting. We also present evidence that the pattern of symptoms produced by the pro‐inflammatory cytokines reflects a shift in immune system functioning towards a (T‐helper‐1) Th1 profile. This position contrasts with other immunological accounts of GWS that suggest that the immune system demonstrates a shift to a Th2 (allergy) profile. Evidence pertaining to these two contrasting positions is reviewed.",

      "abstract": "The estuarine dinoflagellate Pfiesteria piscicida gen. et sp. nov. produces exotoxin(s) that can be absorbed from water or fine aerosols. Culture filtrate (0.22 microns porosity filters, > 250 toxic flagellated cells/ml) induces formation of open ulcerative sores, hemorrhaging, and death of finfish and shellfish. Human exposure to aerosols from ichthyotoxic cultures (> or = 2000 cells/ml) has been associated with narcosis, respiratory distress with asthma-like symptoms, severe stomach cramping, nausea, vomiting, and eye irritation with reddening and blurred vision (hours to days); autonomic nervous system dysfunction [localized sweating, erratic heart beat (weeks)]; central nervous system dysfunction [sudden rages and personality change (hours to days), and reversible cognitive impairment and short-term memory loss (weeks)]; and chronic effects including asthma-like symptoms, exercise fatigue, and sensory symptoms (tingling or numbness in lips, hands, and feet; months to years). Elevated hepatic enzyme levels and high phosphorus excretion in one human exposure suggested hepatic and renal dysfunction (weeks); easy infection and low counts of several T-cell types may indicate immune system suppression (months to years). Pfiesteria piscicida is euryhaline and eurythermal, and in bioassays a nontoxic flagellated stage has increased under P enrichment (> or = 100 micrograms SRP/L), suggesting a stimulatory role of nutrients. Pfiesteria-like dinoflagellates have been tracked to fish kill sites in eutrophic estuaries from Delaware Bay through the Gulf Coast. Our data point to a critical need to characterize their chronic effects on human health as well as fish recruitment, disease resistance, and survival.",

The major sleep disorders discussed in this chapter are insomnia (characterized by dissatisfaction with sleep quantity or quality), hypersomnia or hypersomnolence (characterized by excessive sleepiness), narcolepsy (caused by loss of orexin neurones in the central nervous system (CNS), mutations in orexin receptors or deficits in the synthesis of orexin and characterized by an urge to sleep) and cataplexy (typified by bilateral weakness of the skeletal muscles). Sleep disorders are divided into two general categories, dyssomnias and parasomnias. Dyssomnias are disorders where there are problems falling asleep, staying asleep or of excessive sleepiness; they are characterized by irregularities in the timing, quantity and quality of sleep. Parasomnias are disorders about sleep–wake transitions and are characterized by strange or abnormal behaviours, incidents or experiences that occur during sleep.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Although catatonia was conceptualized as a subtype of schizophrenia, it is now recognized to occur most commonly in the course of other psychiatric disorders, in drug-induced disorders [1] or neurologic conditions [2]. Catatonia is rarely seen together with OCD and there are a limited number of case reports in the literature [3,4]. Objective We describe the case of a 12 year boy who presented in our clinic with mutism, negativism, immobility, social withdrawn, rigid posture, refusal to eat. Method We performed a thorough psychiatric diagnostic assessment of the child as well as laboratory tests and MRI of the brain. Results The child's first symptoms appeared 2 years ago: initially the child became socially withdrawn, spent most of time at his room, and became preoccupied with rituals of hand washing, walking back and forth, preoccupations with food contamination, became aggressive if someone would interrupt what he was doing, stopped going at school, and stopped calling his parents “mother” or “father”. Brain MRI showed lateral ventricular asymmetry and suboccipital cyst. Conclusions The child was put on therapy with lorazepam and sertraline. His obsessive-compulsive symptoms improved, and the apparent catatonic like features resolved and did not return over follow-up. Discussion Catatonia is not uncommon among children and adolescents, and the relationship between OCD and catatonia is still misunderstood, but it may be an indicator of the severity of the OCD. Disclosure of interest The authors have not supplied their declaration of competing interest.",

These seizures can be convulsive or nonconvulsive, and may significantly affect the pathobiology of the patient's critical condition. The use of continuous electroencephalography has become very ­important in the identification and treatment of seizures in critically ill patients with hepatic or other metabolic disorders. Seizures arise either as a direct result of the organ failure, or as a result of a secondary metabolic disturbance. ­Correction of the underlying metabolic syndrome may result in the prevention and treatment of the seizures. Secondary organ failure and endocrine abnormalities are commonly seen in the neurocritically ill population, and these patients are more prone to seizures. Organ failure can influence the treatment of both new onset and preexisting seizure disorders by altering the pharmacokinetics of major anticonvulsants. Alternatively, anticonvulsants can precipitate organ failure. Therefore, pharmacotherapy of seizures in these settings should be undertaken cautiously.",

Furthermore, MMN can serve as a measure of recovery or neural reorganization in different neurological disorders. For example, the recovery from aphasic symptoms after stroke was associated with the enhancement of MMN. MMN has also been useful in determining neural plastic changes of the auditory system associated with cochlear implantation.",

Für die akute Schmerztherapie ist komplementär eine bitemporale Akupunktur an Ex-KH5 einen Versuch wert. Bei fehlendem Ansprechen sowie vier und mehr Attacken pro Monat, einer Migränedauer über zwei Tage und persistierender neurologischer Begleitsymptomatik ist eine Intervalltherapie angezeigt. Hierfür sollten bevorzugt nicht-medikamentöse Verfahren wie Entspannung, Ablenkung, Bewältigungstraining, Biofeedback und triggerarme Ernährung zum Einsatz kommen.

Functional abdominal pain is usually classified as either irritable bowel syndrome or nonulcer dyspepsia, but some patients have intermittent abdominal pain associated with headache or other migraine accompaniments and, in these, a diagnosis of abdominal migraine should be considered. It is possible that some patients with functional abdominal pain have migraine presenting with few or even no migraine accompaniments. There is no nonclinical objective standard for diagnosing migraine, and research in this area is therefore very difficult. Nevertheless, some patients with functional abdominal pain may respond to antimigraine medication and, if their symptoms are suggestive, a trial of therapy may be desirable.",

      "abstract": "Delayed awakening from anaesthesia remains one of the biggest challenges that involve anaesthesiologists. Most commonly, delayed awakening is due to drugs effects persistence. 1 The time taken to emerge to fully consciousness is affected by patient factors, anaesthetic factors, duration of surgery and painful stimulation. Non pharmacological causes may have serious sequel; thus recognising these organic conditions is important. 2 Unexpected delayed emergence after the use of general anaesthesia has a plethora of causes. 3 The most common cause for delayed awakening following anaesthesia is medications and anaesthetic agents used in the perioperative period. There may be an over dose of medications. Emergence from anaesthesia depends on the tissue uptake of the drug, average concentration used and the duration of exposure. Certain underlying metabolic disorders such as hypoglycaemia, severe hyperglycaemia, electrolyte imbalance especially hyponatremia, hypoxia, hypercapnia, central cholinergic syndrome, chronic hypertension, liver disease, hypoalbuminemia, uraemia and severe hypothyroidism may also be responsible for delayed recovery after anaesthesia. Preoperative medications such as opioids and sedatives and hypothermia can further interfere with postoperative recovery. Intraoperative cerebral hypoxia, haemorrhage, embolism or thrombosis also can manifest as delayed awakening from anaesthesia. The ultimate goal of treatment is to find the cause and treat the cause, but primary management is to maintain airway, breathing and circulation.",

      "title": "0998 Duloxetine as a Possible Effective Treatment of Klein-Levin Syndrome Case Report",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Kleine Levin Syndrome (KLS), or recurrent hypersomnia, is a rare sleep disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of severe hyper-somnolence lasting several days to several weeks. Because the etiology is unknown, treatment is mostly supportive. Some pharmacologic agents have been attempted to treat symptoms during episodes with limited success. Report of case(s) Patient is a 17 year-old with a history attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and generalized anxiety disorder who presented to the clinic due to recurrent episodes of severe hypersomnolence associated with derealization and cognitive dysfunction during all episodes, anxiety of being alone, and other symptoms in some episodes such as altered taste affecting appetite, and binge eating. The patient was diagnosed with KLS and tracked episodes which lasted 11-12 days (average) with recurrence every 10-17 days. Labs, 72 hour EEG, MRI and MRA were largely unremarkable. The family declined trial of Lithium. Pharmacogenetic testing showed significant gene-drug interaction with duloxetine requiring higher drug dosage for effects. After psychiatry started duloxetine, the patient experienced a 7 month period without episodes. Then episodes recurred for unclear reason while on duloxetine but with slightly less duration (6-12 days) and shorter time between episodes. Duloxetine was discontinued due to lack of mood effects. Clarithromycin was trialed next for use during episodes without changes. Episodes were tracked for several months with some predictability. Duloxetine was restarted a second time after several months, and the patient showed mild improvement in event duration down to 8-11 days for a few months. Time between episodes also shortened to 8-10 days. Anxiety was only slightly reduced between and during the episodes, though they still continued to struggle with derealization and ability to focus during episodes that effected school and work functioning. Interestingly, they also started to have more insomnia between episodes while on duloxetine. Conclusion KLS is a rare disorder with limited data on effective treatments. To date, this is the first report of a prolonged brief KLS remission with duloxetine. Norepinephrine and serotonin modulation may limit episode duration. More research is needed to determine whether duloxetine can modulate the effects of KLS. Support (if any) None",

      "abstract": "The brain and the gut are linked together with a complex, bi-path link known as the gut-brain axis through the central and enteric nervous systems. So, the brain directly affects and controls the gut through various neurocrine and endocrine processes, and the gut impacts the brain via different mechanisms. Epilepsy is a central nervous system (CNS) disorder with abnormal brain activity, causing repeated seizures due to a transient excessive or synchronous alteration in the brain's electrical activity. Due to the strong relationship between the enteric and the CNS, gastrointestinal dysfunction may increase the risk of epilepsy. Meanwhile, about 2.5% of patients with epilepsy were misdiagnosed as having gastrointestinal disorders, especially in children below the age of one year. Gut dysbiosis also has a significant role in epileptogenesis. Epilepsy, in turn, affects the gastrointestinal tract in different forms, such as abdominal aura, epilepsy with abdominal pain, and the adverse effects of medications on the gut and the gut microbiota. Epilepsy with abdominal pain, a type of temporal lobe epilepsy, is an uncommon cause of abdominal pain. Epilepsy also can present with postictal states with gastrointestinal manifestations such as postictal hypersalivation, hyperphagia, or compulsive water drinking. At the same time, antiseizure medications have many gastrointestinal side effects. On the other hand, some antiseizure medications may improve some gastrointestinal diseases. Many gut manipulations were used successfully to manage epilepsy. Prebiotics, probiotics, synbiotics, postbiotics, a ketogenic diet, fecal microbiota transplantation, and vagus nerve stimulation were used successfully to treat some patients with epilepsy. Other manipulations, such as omental transposition, still need more studies. This narrative review will discuss the different ways the gut and epilepsy affect each other.",

A total of 409 sleep disorder patients were studied with all-night polysomnogram recording, and 53 (13%) had PMS. Such movements occurred in a wide variety of sleep-wake disorders in addition to insomnia. The prevalence and magnitude of PMS were not statistically greater in patients with insomniac disorders than in those with syndromes of excessive daytime sleepiness or other sleep-wake disorders. The results suggest that although PMS is responsible for disturbed sleep in relatively few patients, chronic sleep-wake disturbance is associated with PMS and may lead to the development of these movements.",

      "abstract": "Functional abdominal pain (FAP) is one of the most common pain syndromes in childhood and is a functional gastrointestinal disorder (FGID). Recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) is characterized by three or more episodes of abdominal pain that occurover at least 3 months and are severe enough to interfere with activities. It may be caused by many conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease, peptic ulcer, pancreatitis or, functional abdominal pain. The most common clinical manifestation is periumbilical pain related to autonomic and functional symptoms like nausea, vomiting, pallor and other painful conditions like headache and limb pains. RAP requires accurate diagnostic tests to rule out organic causes of pain based on ‘red flag’ sign. Furthermore, to diagnose and classify functional abdominal pain, Rome III criteria were published and updated with multiple discussions of FGIDs. Conventional interventions for RAP include reassurance and general advice, symptom-based pharmacological therapies, and psychological and behavioral treatments. But further research should be conducted to advance our understanding of the multiple factors involved in the pathogenesis of this group of conditions and to provide evidence for its therapeutic benefit.

The prevalence of the disease is of 11%. It usually occurs in patients aged over 50 years, and the frequency increase with age. It is uncommon in persons aged under 30 years. In children it is almost unknown. When it does occur in this age group it is usually associated with the restless legs syndrome.To obtain data regarding this disorder in childhood, in view of the scarcity of information available in the literature and the importance of the neuropsychological problems and difficulty with learning that affected children have.We report two cases of PML occurring in girls of under 7 years of age. They had severe associated neuropsychological disorders (disorders of behavior and feeding, psychotic episodes, etc.). The effect on performance at school led to complete failure in one case. We describe the clinical course of the two girls, emphasizing the variability, and both diagnostic and therapeutic difficulties.Although this condition is uncommon in childhood, it should always be borne in mind in cases of children with sleep disorders, since early diagnosis will prevent major behavior and learning problems.",

      "abstract": "Antécédents Le dysfonctionnement émotionnel est présent dans de nombreuses pathologies mentales des enfants et des adolescents. On observe ce dérèglement aussi bien dans des troubles de type anorexie nerveuse (AN), mérycisme, évitement-restriction, que dans des troubles, tels que la boulimie nerveuse (BN), le syndrome d’hyperphagie incontrôlée (binge-eating), et les troubles du comportement alimentaire (TCA), que ceux-ci soient spécifiés ou pas. Le dysfonctionnement émotionnel peut également être observé dans le spectre bipolaire. Ainsi, il est démontré qu’il existe des ressemblances entre un spectre bipolaire mineur (sous des formes au-dessous du seuil) et des syndromes ou « sous-syndromes » de troubles de la conduite alimentaire chez les adolescents. C’est de ces prémisses que naît la recherche qu’on présente [aujourd’hui] et qui a pour but d’évaluer le dysfonctionnement émotionnel (mesuré à travers le CLH-32) et les habitudes alimentaires (mesurées à travers la BEDS) dans une population touchée par les TCA. Méthodes Il s’agit d’une étude transversale basée sur l’observation d’un corpus de patients âgés de 12 à 19 ans et ayant été touchés de TCA avant l’âge de 18 ans et suivant un traitement intrahospitalier ( n = 40). L’échantillon a été divisé en deux sous-ensembles : I-AN ( n = 17) et II-BN ( n = 23) et on a procédé à établir des corrélations et des régressions linéaires afin de pouvoir déterminer quelles variables étaient associées au dysfonctionnement émotionnel dans chacun des deux groupes. Résultats Le groupe I-AN a présenté des scores élevés sur la CLH-32, qui ne gardaient pas de corrélation positive avec les trouvailles sur l’échelle BEDS. Le groupe II-BN a présenté des scores élevés sur la CLH-32, qui montrent une corrélation positive avec les trouvailles sur l’échelle BEDS, notamment dans la sous-échelle Symptômes de l’Hypomanie associés à la désinhibition, le contrôle de soi et la capacité d’attention (CLH-32-Facteur 2). Conclusions Le dysfonctionnement émotionnel est un facteur à prendre en considération dans le dépistage et l’abord clinique des patients souffrant de TCA, que ce soit en anorexie nerveuse, en boulimie nerveuse ou autres TCA, puisqu’ils peuvent présenter d’autres pathologies comorbides. Par ailleurs, la boulimie nerveuse, notamment celle qui se développe avec dysfonctionnement émotionnel, peut être mise en rapport avec l’hypomanie ou un spectre bipolaire.",

      "abstract": "Pediatric sleep-related health issues are more common and have significant impact on the health and well-being of the child. Approximately 25% of all children develop sleep problems ranging from difficulty falling asleep and night awakenings to more serious sleep disorders such as narcolepsy or obstructive sleep apnea. The complications related to sleep disorder include cardiovascular, metabolic, and neurocognitive conditions as well as failure to thrive and growth retardation. Children also developed social and academic growth retardation. This chapter describes how to recognize, evaluate, and treat sleep disorders in children. This chapter also addresses sleep problems and special populations including pregnancy and menopausal states. Maternal sleep quality in the perinatal period begins to change; it has been noted that the greatest sleep disruption tends to occur approximately 1 week postpartum. Approximately 50% of women experience excessive daytime sleepiness at 18 weeks postpartum. Postpartum major depression is a serious illness that occurs in approximately 13% of mothers, negatively affecting both the mother's and child's psychological adjustment. Poor sleep clearly is a major confounder in maternal depression. Menopause is a time of change of life for women. By definition, menopause is considered when there has been the absence of menstrual periods for 1 year. Hormonal changes begin 7–10 years before the final menses. During this perimenopausal period, the pituitary-gonadal axis changes with decreasing estradiol and progesterone and rising FSH and LH.",

Cette dernière peut constituer la cause du retard des acquisitions (encéphalopathie épileptogène) ou bien n'être qu'une traduction supplémentaire conséquence d'une pathologie neurologique sous jacente commune (encéphalopathie avec épilepsie). Elle n'est alors pas seule responsable du retard. Dans le cadre des encéphalopathies avec épilepsie une démarche diagnostique rigoureuse est nécessaire avec notamment un examen cutané (syndromes neuro‐cutanés), un examen moteur (séquelles anoxo‐ischémiques de la période périnatale), un EEG, une imagerie par résonance magnétique (IRM) cérébrale ainsi que la recherche d'anomalies associées (cardiaque, rénale…). D'autre part il existe des encéphalopathies épileptogènes telles que les syndromes liés à l'âge : syndrome hémiconvulsions, hémiplégie, épilepsie (HHE) ; syndrome de Rasmussen, épilepsie myoclonique sévère du nourrisson (syndrome de Dravet), épilepsie myoclono‐astatique (Doose) que nous développerons comme exemples. L'âge, le type de crises et l'EEG sont utiles pour le diagnostic dans ce cas, les autres examens étant généralement peu contributifs. Retard et épilepsie sont souvent associés et la première étape du diagnostic est d'essayer de comprendre si l'épilepsie est une cause active du désordre cognitif ou non, afin d'affiner la démarche étiologique mais aussi d'adapter la prise en charge thérapeutique.",

Paroxysmal episodes of pain abdomen with neurological symptoms like dizziness, post-ictal sleep or lethargy, specific electro-encephalographic changes and improvement in symptoms after treatment with antiepileptic drugs help in diagnosis of abdominal epilepsy. We report a seven-year-old girl with recurrent episodes of abdominal pain. Cause of pain remained undiagnosed despite extensive investigative workup. Meticulous history and pain diary gave clue to the diagnosis. EEG conducted during pain episode was abnormal. Treatment with Valproate resolved the pain. Normalization of EEG findings on follow up confirmed the diagnosis of abdominal epilepsy.",

      "abstract": "As a highly differentiated physiological process, swallowing may be affected by a variety of confounding factors. Primarily described are swallowing disorders caused by mechanical anatomic changes (e. g., alteration of the cervical spine, goiter), surgery for head and neck tumors, thyroid abnormalities, and neuromuscular disorders. Age-related cerebral neurological and blood vessel-associated changes can also cause dysphagia (so-called presbyphagia) or worsen the condition.Medication-associated dysphagia is recognized far less frequently, not paid due attention, or accepted in silence; particularly in older patients. Furthermore, pharmacological interference of different medications is frequently inadequately considered, particularly in the case of polypharmacy.Initial treatment of medication-induced dysphagia includes a critical review of medication status, with the aim of reducing/discontinuing the causative medication by giving precise instructions regarding its administration; as well as antacid medication, diet, and professional oral stimulation or swallowing training.To date, medication-induced dysphagia has not occupied the focus of physicians and therapists. This is despite the fact that many active agents can have a negative effect on swallowing and medication-induced dysphagia caused by polypharmacy is not uncommon, particularly in old age. This article presents an overview of the different classes of drugs in terms of their direct or indirect negative effects on the swallowing function.",

      "abstract": ". Istirahat dan tidur merupakan kebutuhan dasar yang dibutuhkan oleh semua\r\norang. Setiap orang memerlukan kebutuhan istirahat atau tidur yang cukup agar\r\ntubuh dapat berfungsi secara normal (Wicaksono, 2012). Tidur merupakan salah\r\nsatu fungsi biologis yang berperan penting dalam status kesehatan individu.\r\nSebagian individu mengalami masalah dengan tidurnya, dimana gangguan tidur\r\nyang sering terjadi salah satunya adalah insomnia (Putri dan Bayhakki, 2016).\r\nDi Indonesia, belum diketahui angka pastinya namun prevalensi pada orang\r\ndewasa mencapai 20% (Wicaksono, 2012). Insomnia merupakan keadaan tidak\r\ndapat tidur atau terganggunya pola tidur. Orang yang bersangkutan mungkin tidak\r\ndapat tidur, sukar untuk jatuh tidur, atau mudah terbangun dan kemudian tidak\r\ndapat tidur lagi. Insomnia umumnya merupakan kondisi sementara atau jangka\r\npendek. Dalam beberapa kasus, insomnia dapat menjadi kronis. Hal ini sering\r\ndisebut sebagai gangguan tidur yang paling sering terjadi yang berhubungan\r\ndengan situasional stres akut, seperti pekerjaan baru atau menjelang ujian.\r\nInsomnia ini biasanya hilang ketika stressor hilang atau individu telah beradaptasi\r\ndengan stressor. Namun, insomnia sementara sering berulang ketika tegangan\r\nbaru atau serupa muncul dalam kehidupan pasien (Kaplan dan Sadock, 2010).\r\nDalam TCM, insomnia yang diakibatkan sindrom hiperaktivitas Yang karena\r\ndefisiensi Yin disebabkan karena kebiasaan makan manis sehingga terjadi panas\r\npada lambung yang dapat mengganggu fungsi transformasi dan transportasi limpa.\r\nDisamping itu, insomnia juga disebabkan karena suka berpikir. Berpikir yang\r\nmelampaui batas mengakibatkan peredaran Qi terhalang dan fungsi transportasi\r\ndan transformasi Pi-limpa tidak berjalan dengan normal. Organ lambung yang\r\nekses dan organ limpa yang defisiensi (unsur tanah) tidak dapat membatasi organ\r\nginjal sehingga menyebabkan defisiensi Yin pada organ ginjal. Dengan adanya\r\ndefisiensi Yin ginjal menyebabkan Yin ginjal tidak dapat menguap ke atas untuk\r\nmembatasi Yang Qi jantung. Karena Yin ginjal tidak dapat membatasi Yang Qi\r\njantung menyebabkan terjadinya hiperaktivitas api jantung. Saat api jantung\r\nterganggu, Shen-jiwa ikut terganggu menyebabkan terjadinya insomnia.\r\nPenanganan yang dilakukan pada penderita insomnia yaitu terapi akupresur\r\ndan terapi herbal. Terapi akupresur dilakukan pada titik Neiguan (PC6), Shenmen\r\n(HT7), dan Sanyinjiao (SP6) dilakukan sebanyak 12 kali terapi yang diberikan\r\nsebanyak 3 kali dalam seminggu. Serta terapi herbal setiap hari selama 28 hari\r\ndengan menggunakan simplisia daun putri malu (Mimosa pudica) dengan dosis 10\r\ngram yang direbus dengan 750 mL air, diminum sehari 1 kali sebanyak 200 mL\r\nsebelum tidur.\r\nDari hasil setelah pemberian terapi kombinasi akupresur pada titik Neiguan\r\n(PC6), Shenmen (HT7), dan Sanyinjiao (SP6) serta pemberian herbal putri malu\r\n(Mimosa pudica) dapat memberikan hasil yang baik terhadap pasien dengan\r\nkeluhan insomnia. Pasien merasa lebih tenang, relaks, dan pasien merasa mudah\r\nmengantuk pada malam hari.",

      "title": "Late recovery from permanent traumatic vegetative state heralded by event-related potentials",
      "abstract": "A post-traumatic vegetative state that holds for more than 12 months is defined as “permanent”, implying a very low probability of regaining consciousness. Here we report on a patient who emerged from a traumatic vegetative state after 20 months. Beginning from the 6th month, we observed an improvement in the event-related potentials (ERPs) of his brain to complex sensory and verbal stimulation, although the clinical examinations remained unchanged. The possible role of ERPs as predictors of regaining consciousness after a vegetative state is discussed.\n\nThe vegetative state is a most severe neurological syndrome and includes the loss of all kinds of conscious behaviour despite preserved wakefulness.1 In patients with traumatic head injury, a vegetative state that holds for more than 1 year is considered to be “permanent”, which implies irreversibility. In fact, even minimal improvement after this period is extremely improbable. From time to time, however, cases of late emergence are reported,2,3 sometimes even 5 years after the incident.4 The statement “The available data are insufficient to provide a trustworthy estimate of the incidence of late improvement” (Childs and Merger,3 p 24) is still valid; figures varying as broadly as from 1.6% to 14% have been reported.1,3\n\nGiven the rarity of such cases, the slightest hint that such an unexpected improvement may occur would be useful. Here we describe a patient in whom cognitive components of cortical ERPs were consistently obtained for more than 1 year before clinical recovery.\n\nA 28-year-old man was admitted to an intensive care unit with a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3 after a severe car accident. After 5 days, he regained vigilance but had diminished gaze fixation and could not follow even the simplest commands. Intensive stimulation resulted in generalised flexor responses. Three months …",

Patients suffering from delirium experience an acute change in mental status, fluctuating levels of consciousness, and an inability to acquire new information. Patients with major neurocognitive disorder experience significant cognitive decline in complex attention, executive function, learning and memory, language, perceptual-motor, and social cognition. The chapter also discusses mental disorders due to another medical condition. These patients can experience psychotic, mood, or anxious symptoms or a personality change; their intellectual functioning usually remains intact. A patient presenting with a first episode of psychiatric symptoms and no prior psychiatric history should be evaluated for an acute medical etiology causing the psychiatric symptoms, particularly if he or she is over 40 years of age. Anticholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine) may slow the rate of cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease, and the combination of an anticholinesterase inhibitor and memantine may be more effective than either medication alone.",

      "abstract": "> “Hope is a good breakfast but a bad supper” \n> \n> Francis Bacon (1561–1626)\n\nFunctional dyspepsia (FD) has been defined as persistent or recurrent symptoms of unknown cause thought to originate in the proximal gastrointestinal tract. Symptom patterns may vary but usually include epigastric pain or burning. Non-painful dyspeptic symptoms such as early satiation, nausea, postprandial fullness and vomiting suggest an underlying abnormality in gastroduodenal motility. The Rome III consensus committee suggests that FD is subdivided into an epigastric pain syndrome and a postprandial distress syndrome based on symptom patterns.1 These terms have replaced the previous categories of ‘ulcer-like’ and ‘dysmotility-like’ dyspepsia. Dyspeptic symptoms are very common in the general population with prevalence rates of 20–40%, and although FD is not associated with increased mortality or morbidity the symptoms have a major impact on health-related quality of life, utilisation of healthcare resources and work productivity.2\n\nFD is probably a multifactorial disorder. Acid, Helicobacter pylori infection, visceral hypersensitivity, disturbances in gastric motility or accommodation and various psychosocial factors have all been implicated. Empiric antisecretory therapy, H pylori eradication or prokinetics remain the mainstay of treatment for FD, even though meta-analyses have shown limited or no symptomatic effects,3 4 and to date, …",

The most restorative sleep is delta sleep (slow wave sleep or deep sleep) that occurs in Stages 3 and 4 of non-REM sleep; it is during these stages that one is the most difficult to waken. Individuals waken during REM sleep, but the state of being awake is normally so brief that it is not recalled later when in the true wake state.

These have been attributed to a resulting inability to increase hepatic glucose output acutely. A more important consequence may be reduced awareness of impending hypoglycaemia. Such hypoglycaemia unawareness is related to, but not entirely explained by, diminished sympathetic activity, perhaps due to failure to activate the sympathoadrenal system until a lower blood glucose level is achieved. The patient's subsequent failure to act appropriately would then be due to impaired cerebral function preventing the perception of sympathoadrenal activation during the more severe hypoglycaemia. Unawareness of moderate hypoglycaemia is common in diabetic patients. Autonomic neuropathy probably accounts for only a few cases of hypoglycaemia unawareness and other factors which are potentially important include duration of diabetes, glycaemic control, insulin species, and the degree and frequency of hypoglycaemia. Further research is required to discover both the pathophysiological mechanisms of, and the treatment needed to reverse or prevent, the abnormality.",

Misregulation occurs because of false assumptions or misdirected efforts, especially an unwarranted emphasis on emotion. The evidence supports a strength (limited resource) model of self-regulation and suggests that people often acquiesce in losing control. Loss of control of attention, failure of transcendence, and various lapse-activated causes all contribute to regulatory failure.",

      "title": "The biological basis of injury and neuroprotection in the fetal and neonatal brain",
      "abstract": "Abstract A compromised intrauterine environment that delivers low levels of oxygen and/or nutrients, or is infected or inflammatory, can result in fetal brain injury, abnormal brain development and in cases of chronic compromise, intrauterine growth restriction. Preterm birth can also be associated with injury to the developing brain and affect the normal trajectory of brain growth. This review will focus on the effects that episodes of perinatal hypoxia (acute, chronic, associated with inflammation or as an antecedent of preterm birth) can have on the developing brain. In animal models of these conditions we have found that relatively brief (acute) periods of fetal hypoxemia can have significant effects on the fetal brain, for example death of susceptible neuronal populations (cerebellum, hippocampus, cortex) and cerebral white matter damage. Chronic placental insufficiency which includes fetal hypoxemia, nutrient restriction and altered endocrine status can result in fetal growth restriction and long‐term deficits in neural connectivity in addition to altered postnatal function, for example in the auditory and visual systems. Maternal/fetal inflammation can result in fetal brain damage, particularly but not exclusively in the white matter; injury is more pronounced when associated with fetal hypoxemia. In the baboon, in which the normal trajectory of growth is affected by preterm birth, there is a direct correlation between a higher flux in oxygen saturation and a greater extent of neuropathological damage. Currently, the only established therapy for neonatal encephalopathy in full term neonates is moderate hypothermia although this only offers some protection to moderately but not severely affected brains. There is no accepted therapy for injured preterm brains. Consequently the search for more efficacious treatments continues; we discuss neuroprotective agents (erythropoietin, N‐acetyl cysteine, melatonin, creatine, neurosteroids) which we have trialed in appropriate animal models. The possibility of combining hypothermia with such agents or growth factors is now being considered. A deeper understanding of causal pathways in brain injury is essential for the development of efficacious strategies for neuroprotection.",

      "title": "Early‐Onset Benign Childhood Occipital Seizure Susceptibility Syndrome: A Syndrome to Recognize",
      "abstract": "Summary: Early‐onset benign childhood occipital seizures (EBOS) described by Panayiotopoulos constitute the commoner after the rolandic phenotype of a childhood seizure susceptibility syndrome. EBOS are the clinical representative of occipital spikes. Their cardinal features are infrequent (often single) partial seizures manifested with deviation of the eyes and vomiting, frequently evolving to hemi‐ or generalized convulsions. Ictal behavioral changes, irritability, pallor, and rarely cyanosis, and eyes wide open are frequent. Retching, coughing, aphemia, oropharyngolaryngeal movements, and incontinence may occur. Consciousness is usually impaired or lost, either from the onset or the course of the fits, but in a few children, it may be preserved. Duration varies from a few minutes to hours (partial status epilepticus). Seizures are usually nocturnal, but semiology is similar in nocturnal or diurnal fits. Onset is between 1 and 12 years with a peak at 5 years. One third of children have a single seizure, the median total number of fits is two to three, and the prognosis is invariably excellent, with remission usually occurring within I year from onset. A few children may later develop rolandic or other benign partial seizures. The likelihood to have seizures after age 12 years is exceptional and rarer than that of febrile convulsions. EEG shows occipital paroxysms demonstrating fixation‐off sensitivity, but random occipital spikes, occipital spikes in sleep EEG alone, or normal EEG may occur. Centrotemporal and other spike foci may appear in the same or more frequently in subsequent EEGs. The EEG does not reflect clinical course and severity.",

      "title": "Exploration of sleep disorders in the elderly: which particularities?",
      "abstract": "There are many reasons to take into consideration the sleep disorders in the elderly. The sleep quality degrades with age and is strongly affected by medical conditions, intrinsic sleep disorders, or by a combination of these factors. Other age-related conditions such as severe dementia, dependence or living in institution worsen sleep disturbances in older people. When living alone elderly people, being cognitively impaired and medically disabled, may not be able to complain about sleep problems. Sleep disorders are thus underdiagnosed, unmarked, and insufficiently investigated in the elderly. In this heterogeneous population, sleep assessment should include a global geriatric approach and be individually adapted for each subject. The sleep interview must specially include medical comorbidities, medication uses, and aged-related changes of lifestyle such as retirement, loss of spouse, hospitalization or institutionalization. In the elderly with loss of autonomy, standard sleep assessment is not always adequate and must be replaced by shorter, simpler or observation-based tests such as the Sleep disorders inventory, Observation-based nocturnal sleep inventory, Observation and interview based diurnal sleepiness inventory. When sleep log is impossible, actimetry is an excellent alternative for studying sleep-wake rhythm. Ventilatory polygraphy is a simpler test for detecting sleep apnea than polysomnography. Utilization of sophisticated investigations should be discussed when the feasibility and usefulness is limited.",

MemoryDefects of memory are either in the registration of new experience (antegrade) or the recall of past experience (retrograde).In gross dementia the patient may lose the ability to repeat a series of numbers he has just heard.This immediate type of defect is also seen in dysphasia, or whenever attention or concentration is dis- tracted-as in depression or acute confusional states.Short term memory deficit is tested by inviting the recall of a few numbers and two or three names after five minutes of other conversation.The limbic system, including the mamillary bodies and hippocampus, must be intact for new experience to be registered and recent events recollected.In Korsakow's amnesia, where the main damage is in the mamillary bodies, antegrade amnesia-learning ability-is permanently damaged and several years ofexperience are lost.After head injury an antegrade defect is noted but this is temporary.The retrograde amnesia shrinks until minutes or seconds before the accident.Deep memory, including childhood events, can be retained and recalled when limbic structures no longer function.The long term memory is tested by asking for details of the patient and his family and about important people or events.Moments of great personal pleasure or poignancy can be recalled most clearly.",

Üblicherweise werden chronische Insomnien in der ärztlichen Praxis medikamentös mit Hypnotika oder anderen sedierenden Substanzen, wie etwa sedierenden Antidepressiva behandelt. In den letzten 20 Jahren hat sich gezeigt, dass kognitiv-verhaltenstherapeutische Ansätze (KVT) bei chronischen Insomnien auch unabhängig von der Ursache erfolgreich eingesetzt werden können. Zu den Methoden der kognitiven Verhaltenstherapie gehört die Aufklärung über Schlaf und Schlafhygiene (Psychoedukation), Entspannungstechniken wie etwa die progressive Muskelentspannung, spezifische verhaltenstherapeutische Techniken wie etwa die Stimuluskontrolle oder die Schlafrestriktion sowie kognitive Techniken zur Reduktion nächtlicher Grübeleien. Aufgrund von mehreren, in den letzten Jahren veröffentlichten Meta-Analysen können diese Techniken insbesondere in ihrer Applikation als Kombinationstherapie, als evidenz-basiert und der pharmakologischen Therapie als kurzzeitig gleichwertig und langfristig überlegen angesehen werden.

The most common cause of these symptoms is chronic constipation, which is often treated by a pediatrician or pediatric gastroenterologist. In differen­tial diagnosis, it is very important to distinguish between chronic symptomatic constipation and functional (without an organic basis), which are most common in childhood. Organic causes of constipation are usually dealt with in cooperation with specialized specialists. The main patho­physiological mechanisms of functional constipation are stress, pain during emptying, and fear of further painful bowel movements. The clinical picture is dominated by in­frequent and difficult defecation of a large amount of hard stools. If the history, laboratory and other additional stud­ies indicate functional constipation, and there are no warn­ing signs of chronic symptomatic constipation, complex treatment can be started. Therapy includes psychological preparation of the patient and his family, working with the correct technique of defecation, dietary and regimen mea­sures, sufficient physical activity, the use of osmotic lax­atives.

Dyspepsia may occur either as a functional disorder where the cause is not clear or as a secondary disorder. Hiccup, or more correctly singultus, is a problem where people experience a sharp and involuntary contraction of the muscles of inspiration which causes a sudden sharp inspiration and closure of the glottis.

      "abstract": "This article discusses the clinical manifestations, diagnosis and differential diagnosis, pathophysiology, and management of parasomnias occurring in non-rapid eye movement (REM) sleep.Disorders of arousal are characterized by dissociated sleep, with wake and sleep phenomena intermingling, and local sleep, in which different areas of the brain exist simultaneously in different states of wakefulness or sleep. The frequency of arousals from slow-wave sleep with delta or mixed-frequency activity has a high sensitivity but relatively low specificity for the diagnosis of arousal parasomnias.Disorders of arousal (sleepwalking, sleep terrors, and confusional arousals) are characterized by incomplete awakenings from slow-wave sleep, limited recall of imagery, and partial or complete amnesia. They occur most frequently in childhood. Management includes correction of precipitating factors, attention to safety, behavioral techniques, and medications. Sleep-related eating disorder is a variant of arousal disorders and may be associated with the use of short-acting hypnotics and restless legs syndrome. Complex nocturnal visual hallucinations can occur with visual loss, dementia with Lewy bodies, use of β-adrenergic receptor antagonists, and anxiety. Exploding head syndrome occurs at wake-sleep transition or on waking during the night, is usually benign, and requires treatment only if significant sleep disruption occurs.",

      "abstract": "Alcohol withdrawal syndrome is the most serious complications associated with chronic alcoholism. Sudden deaths are not uncommon in an Alcohol withdrawal syndrome. In severe stages of Alcohol withdrawal syndrome, delirium tremens occurs, which is characterized with agitation, confusion, disorientation, visual and auditory hallucinations in addition to autonomic hyperactivity. A 36-year-old male chronic and heavy alcohol drinker for 15 years abstained from alcohol for 3 days. Consequently, he started having palpitations, sweating and tremors with the complaints of nausea, vomiting, reduced appetite, disturbed sleep, headache, restlessness, fatigue, constipation as alcohol withdrawal symptoms. There were no\r\npsychotic symptoms, no suicidal ideas, and no obsessions or compulsions. He was treated on an outpatient level with combination of Ayurvedic internal medications and procedures for 60 days and is on follow up till date. The patient was treated with kharjuradi manth, ashvagandha churna, vidharigandha churna, muktashukti, drakashaasav, Brahmi vati, syrup shankhpushpi, taruni kusmakar churna & procedures like Shirodhara with Brahmi Him & nasya with jatamansi tail. The treatment approaches to improve the condition of a patient with improvement in sign and symptoms of alcohol dependence, alcohol withdrawal and to increase metabolism. The resulting assessment is done based on the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment of Alcohol revised scale (CIWA-Ar score) and the Questionnaire. After the comprehensive Ayurvedic intervention, there was a complete remission of symptoms with normal hematological parameters. Hence presenting this case is evidence to demonstrate the effectiveness of Ayurvedic treatment in Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome.",

      "abstract": "Neurological outcome after preterm birth refers to neurologically defined conditions due to disorders of the motor system – e.g. spasticity, dyskinesia or ataxia – which are commonly summarized under the term “cerebral palsy” (CP). Studies of CP in relation to birth weight (BW) and gestational age (GA) estimate that infants of very low birth weight (VLBW); i.e., of BW less than 1500 g, or very immature infants; i.e., with GA less than 32 weeks, are between 40 and 100 times more likely to have CP than normal BW infants or infants born at term [1, 2]. No other disability associated with preterm birth, such as learning impairments, mental retardation, behavioral problems or sensorineural deficits, shows such a high difference in prevalence in relation to birth at term or normal BW. This means that CP following preterm birth, or brain compromise affecting the motor system, is probably related to a pathomechanism specifically affecting the immature brain, which stresses the importance of gaining insight into the following questions:",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is frequently regarded as a pure motor disorder. However, this degenerative illness affects also the autonomic as well as the enteric nervous systems. Impairment of gastric motility has been found in 70% of patients with PD. Neuropathological changes have been described in patients with PD in all parts of the nervous system responsible for gastric motility. Gastric motor dysfunction (delayed gastric emptying [GE]) is usually associated with early satiety, anorexia, abdominal fullness, nausea, and vomiting. Abnormalities in gastric myoelectric activity have been found in PD. Dysfunction of gastric motility may contribute to motor fluctuations in PD. Conversely, different medications used for the treatment of PD may exacerbate GE disturbances. Along with dopamine agonists, levodopa itself has been shown to slow gastrointestinal motility. Treatment of gastroparesis is usually problematic. Dietetic interventions, in combination with the use of prokinetic medications, are recommended. Gastrostomy or jejunostomy feeding tubes may also be considered. Jejunostomy, which provides the possibility of direct levodopa infusions into the intestine, may be preferable in fluctuating patients with PD. Data are not yet available on the use of gastric electrical stimulation in PD. To date, there is no satisfactory therapeutic approach to gastroparesis, and the clinician needs considerable creativity to help the patient with PD overcome this disabling syndrome and its consequences.",

It is defined by the presence of headache on 15 or more days a month, of which at least eight must meet the criteria of migraine without aura for a minimum of three months. In addition they must not be due to medication abuse or attributable to any other cause.The prevalence of chronic migraine ranges between 1-3% of the population and its incidence has been estimated to be 2.5% per year. It produces from four to six times more disability, decreased productivity and disruption of quality of life than episodic migraine. The development of chronic migraine has been associated with both non-modifiable risk factors (being female, low socio-economic status and level of schooling) and modifiable risk factors (anxiety, depression, sleep apnoea/snoring, obesity, consumption of painkillers and caffeine). Patients with chronic migraine suffer from chronic pain, anxiety or depression two to three times more often than those with episodic migraine. Management requires identification and control of the risk factors that predispose patients to develop the condition, detoxification therapy in the event of abuse of analgesics, specific treatment for migraine attacks and preventive treatment. The effectiveness of the preventive drugs topiramate and Onabotulinumtoxin A in this complication of migraine has been proved in large-scale placebo-controlled clinical trials.Chronic migraine is a common condition that requires global management aimed at reducing the frequency of the attacks, lowering the associated disability and improving the patients' quality of life.",

What is known about cyclic vomiting syndrome and can it be prevented? <h3>Answer</h3> Cyclic vomiting syndrome includes severe episodic vomiting lasting for hours or days, separated by symptom-free intervals. This gut-brain interaction is poorly understood and is difficult to diagnose. Children suffer from relentless vomiting, lethargy, abdominal pain, anorexia, and nausea. Half of the children require intravenous rehydration. Once diagnosis is made, supportive measures to reduce suffering are recommended and include administering fluids, encouraging sleep, promoting quiet environments, and administering antiemetics or sedatives. In adults, tricyclic antidepressants such as amitriptyline, as well as topiramate as second-line therapy, have been proposed for prophylactic treatment. However, pediatric data are very limited and evidence does not support any recommended course of prophylactic therapy for children with the condition.",

Advances in medical technology, obstetric management, and intensive neonatal care have led to an improvement in survival rates of preterm infants. Very preterm children who lack attentional control have difficulty focusing and sustaining their attention. Compared with term-born controls, studies have reported deficits in very preterm children's ability to selectively attend to stimuli while ignoring distracting stimuli, and to maintain their concentration and performance during long, monotonous tasks. Very preterm children are often characterised by slower reaction times, longer time required to interpret and respond to stimuli, and reduced output. These deficits may be present in the 1st year of life, and continue through school-age into adulthood.",

Organ failure and endocrine abnormalities are commonly seen in the critically ill population, and these patients are more prone to seizures.

      "abstract": "The term ileus signifies not a disease, not a symptom, but a group of symptoms associated with many and widely varying causes. These symptoms are abdominal pain, nausea or vomiting, distension and intestinal obstruction. The relative importance of each symptom varies in the individual case, while collectively they may indicate a condition that varies between harmless postoperative discomfort and a rapidly fatal obstruction. The simplest classification of ileus includes, on the one hand, the mechanical type, where the intestinal obstruction is due to some form of physical interference with the intestinal current, and, on the other hand, the dynamic ileus, in which the obstructions are secondary to some interference with the neuromuscular mechanism of the gut. In the mechanical class we should include stricture, tumors, invaginations, bands, etc. In the dynamic class would fall those cases due to peritonitis, trauma, sepsis, reflex irritations, spinal lesions, etc. But even in the",

      "abstract": "Abstract Annually, at least 21 million children could benefit from pediatric palliative care (PPC) and 8 million would need specialized PPC services. In the USA alone, more than 40,000 children aged 0–19 years die annually; 55% of them are infants younger than 1 year of age. Pain is common, under-recognized, and under-treated, especially in children with progressive neurodegenerative and chromosomal conditions with central nervous system impairment. Unrelieved pain is also common in children with advanced serious illness during the end-of-life period, and, when treated, the therapy is commonly ineffective. Treating pain in children with serious illness is not profoundly different than advanced pain management for children with complex acute conditions or diseases such as major trauma, burns, cancer, or those with sickle cell disease in vaso-occlusive crisis. It is important to appreciate that children with serious illness are more likely to simultaneously suffer from acute pain, neuropathic pain, visceral pain, total pain, and chronic pain. As such, multimodal analgesic (i.e., multiple agents, interventions, rehabilitation, psychological modalities, and integrative (“nonpharmacologic,” e.g., behavioral, physiological, and psychological) therapies that act synergistically for more effective pediatric pain and symptom control with fewer side effects than a single analgesic or modality must be employed. Opioids, such as morphine, fentanyl, hydromorphone, oxycodone, and methadone, remain the mainstay medications to effectively treat pain in children with serious illness. However, medications alone are often insufficient for optimal pain control. In fact, the paradigm shift away from “medications only” toward offering “multimodal analgesia” to children with serious illness experiencing pain, including addressing chronic pain/primary pain disorders and total pain has become a “game changer” in advancing PPC to ensure that patients can live as long as possible, as well as possible.",

Perinatal self-harm may therefore be a marker of untreated illness.

Higher levels of household and caregiving activities and sedentary leisure time behavior in the last trimester of pregnancy appear to increase the likelihood of postpartum depression.

      "abstract": "<h3>Background</h3> Fibromyalgia is characterized by chronic inconsistent widespread pain and tenderness. It is also associated with other comorbid symptoms like sleep disturbances, fatigue, cognitive impairments (memory and mood disturbances), and/or irritable bowel syndrome. <sup>[1]</sup> Prevalence of fibromyalgia is 2.7% globally, being slightly higher in middle aged women (4-9%). 75 to 100 % patients with fibromyalgia face depression, anxiety and/or stress. The probability of occurrence of depression is almost 40% at any stage in the course of fibromyalgia. <sup>[2]</sup> Patients usually report physical symptoms of depression (e.g. appetite, sleep, and sexual dysfunction) rather than mood-related psychological symptoms (e.g. suicidal ideation, low self-esteem), however depression is affective expression of chronic pain and neuromarkers of both cannot be isolate. <sup>[3]</sup> Reviews done till date are either oriented toward specific form of exercise or towards specific outcome. We could not come across any review which included all form of exercise with measurement of multiple outcomes. <h3>Objectives</h3> The aim of this review was to 1) summarize evidence on the effectiveness of rehabilitation strategies in Fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS) and 2) determine the most effective rehabilitation strategy for reducing pain and depression in people with FMS. <h3>Methods</h3> PubMed, Ovid (Sp), and Cochrane search engines were used for identifying the studies done till 1 July 2022. Randomized control trials (RCTs) that have passive control group and active control group were included in this review for primary and secondary aim respectively. The primary outcome measures were Pain and depression. Secondary outcome was one from the sleep or fatigue or healthy related quality of life (HRQOL). <h3>Results</h3> A total of 25 RCTs were included. Separate random effect model meta-analysis is performed for randomised control trial with active and passive control group. Mean difference or Standard Mean difference with 95% confidence interval used to assess the effect size. Studies with passive control group showed moderate to large positive effects on pain (SMD -0.65, 95% CI -0.93 to -0.38; I2 = 72%) and HRQOL(MD -5.40, 95% CI -10.17 to -0.62; I2 = 74%) but non-significant for sleep, fatigue, and depression. Furthermore, on subgroup analysis studies with short term protocol showed significant effect on pain only, whereas studies with long term protocols showed positive effect on pain and HRQOL only but non-significant at the time of post-trial follow-up. Studies with active control group represent non- significant results except mixed exercises which showed positive effect (MD -4.78, 95% CI -7.98 to -1.57; I2 = 0%) for HRQOL. <h3>Conclusion</h3> All rehabilitation strategies were effective for pain and HRQOL, and has marginal effect on depression, sleep, and fatigue but efficacy was not maintained at the time of post-trial follow-up. However, in this review we could not differentiate any rehabilitation strategies for the best among those used in the included studies. <h3>References</h3> [1]Queiroz LP.

Symptom management, to alleviate, for example, nausea, constipation, convulsions, or pain, is paramount. Whereas the management of pain does not differ much from adults, it is expressed very differently by children, and may just present as a ‘too quiet a child’. Communication with a neurologically impaired child may be an everlasting struggle for relatives and caregivers. For this, setting up new communication systems may be very helpful. Other issues in neurologic palliative care for children are intellectual deterioration, swallowing impairment, and withdrawal of life-sustaining medical treatment.",

A transient ankle sprain may turn into a complex regional pain syndrome lasting for months to years; or a week long episode of shingles may cause post-herpetic neuralgia with disabling pain for months or years. Moreover, chronic pain can be an accompanying symptom of largely irreversible underlying disease, such as degenerative arthritis (osteoarthritis), spinal stenosis, or compression fracture resulting from osteoporosis in older people. Chronic pain can also be a primary complaint of clinical conditions such as fibromyalgia and trigeminal neuralgia, for which neither the aetiology nor mechanism is currently well understood.\n\nChronic pain is therefore not simply a chronological extension of acute pain and requires different diagnostic approaches and management strategies.

The refeeding syndrome is a well known cause of delirium, characterized by metabolic disturbances elicited during reintroduction of nutrition after a period of starvation. Although a common complication, it is often not recognized by clinicians.CaseA 53-year-old man presented at the emergency department with psychomotor agitation, irritability and disorientation in time. Apart from previous alcohol abuse he had no documented medical history. Examination led to detection of an intracranial haemorrhage, which could explain cognitive dysfunction. After admission, his level of consciousness gradually improved and he resumed eating and drinking. However, a deterioration of his mental status occurred after three days.Blood analysis revealed a severe hypophosphataemia indicating refeeding syndrome. After a new dietary regimen and aggressive supplementation of electrolytes his mental state improved rapidly. Following correction of phosphate plasma concentration, no further episodes of severe confusion or disorientation were observed.ConclusionsThis case report illustrates that clinicians in both psychiatric and general intensive care must be aware of the numerous causes of delirium that can be present concurrently. Refeeding syndrome may be overlooked initially when more alarming causes of a delirium are noticed.",

      "abstract": "Η ευπάθεια και η σαρκοπενία είναι δύο διαφορετικά κλινικά σύνδρομα, απότοκα διαφορετικών συνιστωσών, τα οποία όμως συχνά αλληλοεπικαλύπτονται. Οι ασθενείς που είναι κλινικά ευπαθείς δυσκολεύονται να διαχειριστούν στρεσογόνους παράγοντες που σχετίζονται με οργανικά, ψυχολογικά ή κοινωνικο-οικονομικά αίτια με αποτέλεσμα να επηρεάζεται η καθημερινότητά τους και να μην μπορούν να φέρουν εις πέρας δραστηριότητες ρουτίνας. Επιπρόσθετα, η σαρκοπενία σχετίζεται με αυξημένο κίνδυνο αρνητικών επιπτώσεων για την υγεία, όπως η απώλεια της αυτονομίας, λειτουργική ανικανότητα, συχνές πτώσεις, κακή ποιότητα ζωής, ιδρυματοποίηση, πολλαπλές και μακρες νοσηλείες και αυξημένη θνητότητα. Παράγοντες όπως η εθνικότητα, το χαμηλό εισόδημα, η κοινωνική απομόνωση, χρόνιες παθήσεις και υποκείμενα νοσήματα, καθώς επίσης και περιβαλλοντικοί παράγοντες αποτελούν το υπόβαθρο για την εκδήλωση και πρόοδο των κλινικών αυτών συνδρόμων. Με την πάροδο της ηλικίας αυξάνει και η επίπτωσή τους. Οι ασθενείς που πάσχουν από κίρρωση του ήπατος συχνά χαρακτηρίζονται ως ευπάθεις ή και σαρκοπενικοί, με αποτέλεσμα να επηρεάζεται αρνητικά η πρόγνωση της νόσου και κατά συνέπεια να αυξάνονται τα ποσοστά νοσηρότητας και θνητότητας. Μελέτες που να συσχετίζουν την κίρρωση με την ευπάθεια και σαρκοπενία μπορεί να βοηθήσουν στην έγκαιρη διάγνωση, πρόληψη και πιθανώς βελτίωση αυτών των κλινικών συνδρόμων. Στόχος της μελέτης αυτής είναι να διαγνωσθεί η ευπάθεια και η σαρκοπενία αντίστοιχα στους κιρρωτικούς ασθενείς και να μελετηθούν βιοδείκτες που πιθανά συσχετίζονται με τις παραπάνω συνθήκες. Ως αποτέλεσμα οι κλινικοί γιατροί θα μπορούν να αντιληφθούν σε πρώιμα στάδια τα προαναφερθέντα κλινικά σύνδρομα, σε κιρρωτικούς ασθενείς με ή χωρίς ρήξη της αντιρρόπησης.",

      "abstract": "Neurogenic dysphagia is characterized by problems with neural control of swallowing caused by various neurological diseases: vascular diseases, traumatic diseases, neoplasms, infections, neuromuscular diseases, and others. In patients of intensive care units after long-term intubation and extubation may evolve “postextubation dysphagia”, characterized by the “learned non-use” phenomenon. Neurogenic dysphagia is a component of bulbar or pseudobulbar palsy, depending on the level of the neurological lesion. Diagnoses of neurogenic dysphagia include clinical examination (water swallow test), videofluoroscopy, upper gastrointestinal tract endoscopy and manometry, fiberoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing, a grade of Penetration-Aspiration Scale, and Fiberoptic Endoscopic Dysphagia Severity Scale. Dysphagia complications (malnutrition, dehydration, weight loss, aspiration, and respiratory tract obstruction) associated with bad functional recovery and life prognosis, so neurogenic dysphagia need a complex treatment: correct feeding pattern of caloric value and consistency, methods of oral cavity mucosa sensitivity stimulation, swallowing process stimulation, physiotherapeutic treatment methods (electrical stimulation of the larynx and tongue root), logopedic exercises therapy, surgical correction, lifestyle correction, and others. Sometimes it is a need for replacement therapy method by nasogastric tube and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy, parenteral feeding in several cases. Neurogenic dysphagia patient rehabilitation includes the “swallowing enhancement” method with optimal food consistency and training method after correct preparation of the oral cavity for swallowing. Neurogenic dysphagia patient oral feeding requires correct technique and contact with the patient for safety and efficient recovery.",

      "abstract": "Patients presenting with upper gastrointestinal symptoms such as postprandial fullness, early satiation, epigastric pain or burning, upper abdominal bloating, nausea and vomiting often receive the diagnoses of functional dyspepsia (FD), a disorder of the gut–brain interaction, or gastroparesis, a gastric motility disorder. The diagnosis of FD is largely symptom-based, using the Rome IV criteria, while for gastroparesis, establishing delayed gastric emptying (GE) in the absence of gastric outlet obstruction is necessary. However, symptoms of FD and gastroparesis can be indistinguishable, as well as certain pathophysiological mechanisms (ie, delayed GE, impaired gastric accommodation, visceral hypersensitivity) and treatments (ie, antiemetics, prokinetics, neuromodulators). Thus, the presentation and diagnosis of both FD and gastroparesis in clinical practice can be challenging for providers. Moreover, numerous studies have demonstrated that the severity of symptoms does not necessarily correlate with the degree of delay in GE. It has also recently been shown that patients often transition between diagnoses based on the volatile nature of GE test results. This calls for a reconceptualisation of these diagnostic entities. The aim of this review is therefore to perform a critical appraisal of similarities and differences between FD and gastroparesis and to provide a practical guide for the practising clinician.",

Any chemical can become toxic if too much is taken in relation to body weight and physiologic capacity. ■ Substance misuse often leads to acute and chronic toxicity from a variety of medications, commercial products, and illicit agents. The management of acute toxicity from substance misuse typically follows the same general approaches as those for poisoning and overdose. A challenge faced in many acute drug overdoses is determining the agents taken and possible adulterants or contaminants. Chronic misuse can lead to dependence, tolerance, withdrawal, and addiction. ■ Substance use disorder is a maladaptive pattern of substance use leading to clinically significant impairment or distress within a 12-month period.

Absence SE, partial absence SE, or complex partial SE may present as nonconvulsive SE. Neonatal seizures occur in patients under 29 days old, and they are usually related to significant neurological disease. Pediatric patients are unique in that several characteristic epileptic syndromes have an age-dependent appearance, one or more characteristic seizure types, a natural history, and a prognosis.

      "title": "Depression, women, and the workplace.",
      "abstract": "Depression is a highly prevalent disorder that causes much personal distress and difficulties in functioning at home and in the workplace. In the workplace, as elsewhere, depression can manifest as a variation in normal mood, as a symptom, as a disorder, or as a disease. Occupational health professionals are more concerned with clinical depression, a term used to signify any type of depression that causes significant personal distress and/or problems in functioning. Clinical depression is manifest in the workplace and adversely affects the employee's work satisfaction and performance. For most types of depression, women are at a higher risk than men. A number of events and variables related to women and depression were reviewed. Although the effects of some of these events, such as menopause, can be manifest in the workplace, they are not associated with an increased incidence of clinical depression. Other events, such as victimization (e.g., childhood sexual abuse or battering by an intimate partner), are associated with higher risks of depression in women. Women derive substantial satisfaction from interpersonal relationships but also are at greater risk for depression when strains and conflicts in these relationships occur. In the workplace women who have no difficulty in arranging for child care and whose spouses share in the care of children show lower rates of depression. When marriages are unhappy, women are three times as likely as men to be depressed. These findings speak to the importance of relationships to women. In the workplace, when women are depressed, problems with relationships are likely to be involved. Clinically depressed women are not difficult to identify in work settings. Dejected mood and loss of interest in usual activities are noticeable, along with numerous other symptoms that accompany depression. The effective treatment of depression depends on careful diagnosis and assessment. Both drug therapy and the more structured psychotherapies, such as cognitive-behavioral and interpersonal therapy, have demonstrated effectiveness in treating depression. For mild depression, pharmacotherapy is likely to be the treatment of choice. In cases in which the depressive symptomatology is moderate to severe, a combination of drug therapy and psychotherapy is likely to be the most effective treatment and to provide the best prophylaxis. Drug therapy seems particularly effective in promoting rapid reduction of vegetative and physical symptoms. Psychotherapy enhances coping skills at home and at work and also focuses on problem-solving, relationship difficulties, and dealing with stressors. In the area of prevention, occupational health practitioners currently can have the greatest impact in secondary prevention.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

Karya Tulis Ilmiah Studi Kasus, Program Studi DIII Keperawatan, Jurusan Keperawatan, Politeknik Kesehatan Kemenkes Riau. Pembimbing (I) Ns. Nia Khusniyati M, S.Kep, M.Kep (II) Hj. Melly, SST, M.Kes.\r\n\r\nDiabetes Mellitus adalah suatu keadaan dimana tubuh bisa menghasilkan hormon insulin sesuai kebutuhan atau tubuh tidak bisa memanfaatkan secara optimal insulin yang dihasilkan, sehingga terjadi lonjakan kadar gula dalam darah melebihi normal. Pada penderita diabetes mellitus terutama yang sudah bersifat kronik dapat terjadi gangguan atau komplikasi berupa neuropati diabetik, protein uria, kelainan koroner. Pada kerusakan sistem saraf dibagi tiga kelompok yaitu kerusakan sistem saraf perifer, kerusakan saraf otonom, kerusakan saraf motorik. Kerusakan sistem saraf perifer pada umumnya dapat menyebabkan kesemutan, nyeri pada tangan dan kaki, serta berkurangnya sensitifitas atau mati rasa. Sehingga penderita diabetes mellitus lebih tinggi resikonya mengalami masalah kaki yaitu sirkulasi darah kaki ke tungkai yang menurun, berkurangnya perasaan pada kaki, berkurangnya daya tahan tubuh terhadap infeksi. Pada umumnya penderita diabetes mellitus terlambat untuk menyadari bahwa terjadi luka pada kakinya disebabkan gangguan sirkulasi pembuluh darah yang menyebabkan luka tersebut sukar untuk sembuh dan akan menjadi ulkus atau gangren. Tujuan dari penulisan ini adalah mahasiswa mampu memberi asuhan keperawatan secara komprehensif dengan metode kasus yang dilakukan terhadap Ny. J pada tanggal 30 Maret sampai 01 April 2020. Hasil studi kasus ini menyebutkan bahwa Ny. J mengalami diabetes mellitus tipe 2 dengan ulkus diabetik dengan empat masalah keperawtan yaitu nyeri, hambatan mobilitas fisik, kerusakan integritas kulit, resiko infeksi. Evaluasi selama menjalani perawatan nyeri yang dirasakan hilang, nyaman dalam beraktifitas, luka pada kaki pada fase maturasi (penyembuhan). Saran untuk perawat di UPT puskesmas sungai pakning terutama perawat di ruangan rawat inap untuk dapat menerapkan asuhan keperawatan klien diabetes mellitus tipe 2 dengan ulkus diabetik secara komprehensif yang memperhatikan kesembuhan pasien secara teratur. Saran untuk penulis selanjutnya adalah studi kasus ini dapat dikembangkan lagi untuk penulis selanjutnya pada asuhan keperawatan yang lebih rinci lagi untuk menghasilkan asuhan keperawatan yang lebih berkualitas dan bermanfaat bagi pasien. \r\n\r\nKata kunci : Diabetes Mellitus, Ulkus Diabetik, Nyeri, Hambatan Mobilitas, Kerusakan Integritas Kulit, Resiko Infeksi",

Травматичний стрес може викликати травматичний стресовий синдром (ТСС) або посттравматичний стресовий розлад (ПТСР), які характеризуються різними симптомами, такими як повторні спогади про травматичну подію, проблеми зі сном, харчові розлади, депресія тощо. У дітей із порушеннями психофізичного розвитку ці симптоми можуть бути особливо вираженими та можуть потребувати специфічної та індивідуалізованої підтримки. Крім того, травматичні стреси можуть сприяти розвитку інших невротичних і психічних розладів, таких як тривожність, депресія, різноманітні фобії тощо. Ці розлади можуть значно ускладнити життя дитини й вимагати комплексного підходу до їх корекції та підтримки. Однією з важливих характеристик особистості дитини з порушенням інтелектуального розвитку є незрілість її емоційної сфери. Тому важливо вчасно виявляти та вирішувати проблеми, пов’язані з травматичним стресом, у дітей з порушеннями психофізичного розвитку. Саморегуляція вважається ключовою якістю особистості й важливим фактором гармонійних міжособистісних відносин у дітей із такими порушеннями як самих із собою, так і з оточуючим світом. Саморегуляція сприяє подоланню різноманітних перешкод, що заважають повноцінному включенню дитини в реальне життя, а також дозволяє розкрити її психологічний потенціал.",

      "title": "Putting the pieces together: The subjective experience of anorexia nervosa over the course of the disorder",
      "abstract": "Throughout the history of psychology there is evidence of fragmentation, at multiple levels. As a result of this fragmentation knowledge of mental illness exists in the form of separate fragments or pieces, and the understanding of the subjective experience of a mental illness as a whole is often lost in the pieces. Such fragmentation is a concern as it has a significant impact on those suffering from a mental illness, as they may not feel understood, or aspects of their experience of mental illness may be missed or overlooked. Thus potentially reducing the individual's ability and willingness to approach and engage in treatment, reducing the possible efficacy of treatment and increasing the risk of relapse. The experience of not feeling understood, difficulties engaging in treatment and relapse are particularly common for individuals with anorexia nervosa, a disorder which has markedly been prey to the fragmentation in psychology. These experiences are concerning when one considers that anorexia nervosa is a chronic disorder, associated with severe physical and psychological consequences, including death, due to physical complications or suicide. The impact of the disorder stems beyond the individual, with families and care-givers also experiencing high levels of distress. Due to the risk, severity and chronic nature of anorexia nervosa, it is important that understanding of the subjective experience of anorexia nervosa is increased to foster research, development and implementation of efficacious interventions. These concerns led to the research question guiding this research: what is the human subjective experience of anorexia nervosa over the course of the disorder? The purpose of a broad research question was to maximize the pieces of experience gathered, as well as establish the context of experiences, and thereby gathering a picture of the subjective experience of the disorder in its complexity.;As a vast array of, albeit fragmented, knowledge exists on anorexia nervosa over the course of the disorder, theories and hypotheses from the literature were used as points of triangulation. In order to capture the subjective experience of anorexia nervosa qualitative methodology was used, and 15 self defined recovered sufferers of anorexia nervosa were interviewed. During the interview, participants were asked to describe their experience of anorexia nervosa over the course of the disorder, as well as comment on the perceived relevance of theory and hypotheses (or pieces of knowledge) from four different orientations (biological, social-cognitive, family and existential) that exist in the field. Data analysis involved gathering pieces from theory and participant experience, organizing these pieces, and working up from the data to establish a picture of an individual's experience at the different stages of the disorder, and how this changes over time. As the research was exploring both what is the subjective experience, and how it changes over time, data analysis was guided by both phenomenological and grounded theory methodology. An adapted form of Heidegger's (1962) worlds of being was also used, to assist organization of pieces, based on where the experience was in relation to the individual. From this analysis a Threat, Distress, Alleviation Model, as well as phases of maintenance and recovery, were developed that meaningfully tie together pieces of experience, to capture the complex subjective experience of anorexia nervosa at different stages, and how an individual moves through the stages. The Threat, Distress, Alleviation Model, and accompanying phases increase the understanding of the subjective experience of anorexia nervosa, and have the capacity to assist research, development and implementation of efficacious treatment.;The development of the Threat, Distress, Alleviation Model, and accompanying phases, also acts as a small step towards resolving the issue of fragmentation, and recapturing the subjective experience of mental illness.",

      "abstract": "Optic neuritis (ON) is an inflammatory disorder of the optic nerve.Most cases are idiopathic or associated with MS.ON can be associated with a variety of systemic or ocular disorders and is the most common acute optic neuropathy in adults younger than 46 years.[3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13] Acute ON often presents as an isolated clinical event without contributory systemic abnormalities (monosymptomatic ON).Clinical features include periocular pain, abnormal visual acuity and fields, reduced color vision, a relative afferent pupillary defect, and abnormal visual evoked potentials.The fundus may appear normal or demonstrate edema of the optic nerve head (papillitis). 12-180][21][22] The visual deficit of ON may worsen over 1 to 2 weeks and usually begins improving over the next month.Lack of improvement in visual function by 30 days is unusual. 23][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13][14][15][16][17][18] Differential diagnosis includes compressive, ischemic, hereditary, toxic, or other inflammatory optic neuropathies (e.g., sarcoid).These conditions usually do not exhibit the same clinical pattern (table 1) or rate of recovery as monosymptomatic ON. [1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9][10][11][12][13] Treatment of monosymptomatic ON has included oral, retrobulbar, and IV steroids, immunoglobulin, and acupuncture. Monomptomatic acute ON is not rare and because the usefulness of oral prednisone in this disorder has recently been questioned, 23,[78][79][80][81][82] this practice parameter was developed to provide recommendations regarding the management of this common neurologic problem.Evidence review.A literature search was conducted using Medline and Healthstar from 1966 to July 1, 1999.ON was cross-referenced with treatment and therapy.Citations earlier than 1966 were searched by cross-referencing techniques and an Index Medicus hand search.A total of 582 different citations dealing with ON and some aspect of therapy were identified and reviewed.Only literature published in well-disseminated journals dealing specifically with MS-related or idiopathic ON involving at least three patients was retained.Both retrospective and prospective data were reviewed.Citations were excluded when they simply described a small number of individual case reports or reviewed \"ON\" due to diseases such as sarcoid, lupus, anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, trauma, hereditary optic neuropathy, optic nerve compression, or other unrelated optic neuropathy.Definitions for the classification of evidence.Class I.

The causes are not clear. It is likely to be a multifactorial event in which both central and peripheral degenerative processes play a role [4, 5]. In addition, influences from the medication have to be considered, which are certainly not predominant. The central degenerative process involving the dorsal vagal nucleus is certainly significant, but it does not explain the range of symptoms. Involvement of the enteric nervous system is likely to be more crucial, with PD typical changes involving the presence of Lewy bodies extending from the upper esophagus down to the rectum in the Plexus myentericus Auerbach and the Plexus submucosus Meissner [4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].

      "abstract": "Cerebral Palsy (CP) denotes a cluster of neurological disorders manifesting in infancy or early childhood, causing lasting effects on body movement and muscle coordination. It has an impact on the neurological system, particularly on the regions that regulate movement and coordination. People with cerebral palsy usually have difficulty with walking, feeding, or speaking, and may require physical and occupational therapy for management and rehabilitation. The extent of symptoms can vary, and severity can change over time. Cerebral Palsy has been long acknowledged to be associated with various challenges and difficulties in digesting and absorbing nutritional inputs, leading to malnutrition and poor nutritional health. However, little is known about the exact mechanisms behind it and the solutions available to address it. The role of nutrition in cerebral palsy is significant as it can impact multiple factors, including the physical and cognitive development of children. Children with cerebral palsy often have difficulty with chewing and swallowing, leading to poor digestion and nutrient absorption. This can further impact their nutritional status and cause various deficiencies. A proper and customized evidence based nutritional plan is essential to ensure adequate nutritional intake and adequate development, both physically and mentally ensuring quality of life.",

A physician, if consulted, will check for visual or hearing defects, physical illness, and mental retardation. Finding none of these, he may advise the parents to use old-fashioned discipline, consult a psychiatrist, or try a different school. Recently some neurologists and pediatricians are recognizing that many children have specific learning difficulties, probably related to inconspicuous neurological defects. Typically, the child with learning defects is considered normal until he enters school, although his parents may have noted unusual restlessness and late talking. When he starts school, his troubles begin. He doesn't learn to read and write. Instead of receiving the praise and approval his classmates get, he is scolded, made to feel that he is \"bad,\" \"dumb,\" or both. Not receiving recognition for academic success, he engages in mischievous, attention-getting behavior. This combined with his restlessness",

      "title": "Two cases of histamine syndrome with food intolerance and adrenal fatigue",
      "abstract": "Histamine is known as a substance that causes allergies and anaphylaxis, but, in fact, it is a kind of inflammatory cytokine which is involved in immune and inflammatory responses that protect from external materials, such as dust, parasites, and bacteria. Histamine mainly plays a role in physically washing or sterilizing these substances through vasodilation, increasing mucus secretion and expectoration, smooth muscle contraction, and gastric acid secretion. In addition, histamine has central nervous system effects such as arousal and memory, because it is necessary to remember and avoid harmful exposures. Like other cytokines, histamine must be produced, released, and degraded in a balance for proper action. When this balance is broken, various non-specific symptoms from histamine excess, such as rhinitis, urticarial, itching sense, abdominal cramp, diarrhea, epigastric burning, chronic cough, headache, dizziness, edema, insomnia, nervousness, and irritability can be appeared. It is defined as “histamine imbalance” in functional medicine, and some researchers are called it as “histamine syndrome”. This complexity of symptoms often complicates accurate diagnosis, leading to partial or symptomatic treatments. Consequently, histamine syndrome can escalate healthcare burden and decrease quality of life. An integrative and functional medicine approach is important due to this situation. Moreover, histamine syndrome often coexists with food intolerance and adrenal fatigue (functional adrenal insufficiency), necessitating a comprehensive approach that addresses all these aspects simultaneously. In this report, we present two cases of patients with histamine syndrome, accompanied by food intolerance and adrenal fatigue, to explore appropriate directions for functional medicine diagnosis and treatment strategies.",

Attempts to develop guidelines for the assessment and management of this disorder have been hampered by several factors.Foremost among these have been the absence of an objective definition for this disorder, and the rudimentary status of our understanlng of its basic pathophysiology.With regard to the latter, several hypotheses have been advanced.These have included acid pepsin-related injury, duodeno-gastric reflux, gastritis (with or without helicobacter pylori infection), psychopathology, dysmotility, impaired visceral sensation and abnormal perception.Recent research efforts have focused, in particular, on the possible roles of dysmotility and altered perception.In support of dysmotility, several motor abnormalities have been described among patients with functional dyspepsia.These have included gastroparesis, antral hypomotility, duodenal dysmotility and gastric electrical dysrythmias2 A considerable body of evidence also supports the concept of visceral hypersensitivitysubjects with functional dyspepsia have been shown to be hypersensitive to gastric di~tention.~These concepts are of more than theoretical interest, given their potential in diagnosis and the availability of pharmacological agents capable of modulating either motor function or visceral afferent pathways.The description of motor abnormalities has inevitably led to the expectation that therapeutic agents which influence motor function may alleviate dyspeptic symptoms.There has been, in particular, a tendency to latch on to gastroparesis as a key target of diagnostic and therapeutic efforts.Attempts to relate these clinical research findings to the clinical arena have been frustrated, however, by an apparent lack of correlation",

Unmanaged UI decreases quality of life and increases the risk of perineal skin breakdown, which can lead to painful skin irritation and pressure sores. Identifying the type of UI, and treating or eliminating transient causes as a result of acute conditions or medications, are initial steps in appropriate management. Health professionals can identify medication-related causes by reviewing the patient history, diagnoses, symptoms, and medication regimen. Chronic UI is often caused by physiological changes in the bladder; increasing age also can result in changes in bladder and urethral compliance. Other UI risk factors include impaired function, cognition, mobility, and dexterity as well as neurodegenerative damage that affect the patient's ability to toilet or recognize the need to toilet. Chronic or persistent UI is classified as stress, urge, overflow, functional, or mixed. Treatment options for chronic UI are discussed in detail.Pharmacists can have a positive impact on this condition by recommending appropriate medication changes and pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments.",

      "abstract": "To review current knowledge on blood pressure variability.Blood pressure variability has a time-course ranging from a few seconds or minutes (short-term variability) to 24 h (long-term variability) or 1 year (seasonal variations). The variability is influenced by physiological factors such as physical and mental activity (posture, exercise, talking) or behavioral and environmental factors (salt, caffeine, alcohol), and by pathological conditions. In patients with essential hypertension, the day-night pattern of blood pressure change is generally similar to that of normotensives, with a significant nocturnal blood pressure fall (dippers), except that the entire profile is shifted upwards. Nevertheless, in some essential hypertensives the nocturnal fall in blood pressure is absent or reversed (non-dippers), in spite of a decrease in the nocturnal heart rate. In several forms of secondary hypertension (pheochromocytoma, renal failure) and other clinical conditions (sleep apnea syndrome, diabetes mellitus, cardiac transplantation) the nocturnal fall in blood pressure is also absent or reversed.Blood pressure variability and the blunted nocturnal fall in blood pressure may be clinically relevant. Several studies have demonstrated that subjects whose 24-h variability was higher than the group average were more likely to have target-organ damage. Moreover, hypertensive women with a blunted nocturnal fall in blood pressure (non-dippers) are more likely to suffer morbid cardiovascular events than dippers. On theoretical grounds, therefore, antihypertensive treatment that reduces blood pressure variability and preserves the nocturnal fall in blood pressure will help to protect target organs in hypertension. So far, this has not been demonstrated in clinical trials.",

      "title": "Emotional and Autobiographical Memory Deficits in Anorexia Nervosa",
      "abstract": "IntroductionThe two types of eating disorders Anorexia Nervosa and Bulimia Nervosa are considered today's civilization's diseases. The growing interest showed towards eating disorders has a number of reasons. The prevalence of eating disorders among adolescent girls and young women is relatively high, and it shows a growing tendency (Tury & Szabo, 2000). Anorexia has the highest mortality rate among psychiatric disorders (Steinhausen, 2002). If the eating disorders are not recognized and treated, they can become chronic and have multiple somatic complications, usually characterized by high psychiatric comorbidity.In the psychopathology of eating disorders one can observe the occurrence of an altered self-schema. The self-schema refers to a long lasting and stable set of memories that summarize a person's beliefs, experiences and generalizations about the self in specific behavioral domains. A person may have a self-schema based on any aspect of himself/herself as a person, including physical characteristics, personality traits and interests, as long as they consider that aspect of their self important to their own self-definition (Markus, 1977). The self's relationship with and understanding of the body is an important part of selfschema. Body schema generally refers to a person's concept of his/her own body, where it is in space, what it looks like, how it is functioning. Altered body selfschema determines the adaptation of the information coming from the outer and the inner environments, and distorts adaptation of the information regarding weight (Stewart, 2005; Tekcan, Caglar Tas, Topcouglu & Yucel, 2008; Rawal, Park & Williams, 2010). This distortion covers the very basic features of weight, shape and diet as well. In the studies made in the field of eating disorders, the specific thoughts connected to the disorder are particularly emphasized. These thoughts can be worries about eating control, and about weight and shape (Rawal et al., 2010), or about meals.The deficits of emotional functioning have been widely examined in anorexia nervosa (further AN) (Nandrino, Doba, Lesne, Christophe & Pezard, 2006; Jones, Harmer & Cooper, 2008). There is diversity in the ways how different researchers define emotion regulation. The most acceptable definition is: Emotion regulation consists of the extrinsic and intrinsic processes responsible for monitoring, evaluating, and modifying emotional reactions, especially their intensive and temporal features, to accomplish one's goals (Thompson, 1994, p. 27-28). Gross (1998) has proposed a model of emotion regulation which indicates that both cognitive and behavior strategies may be used to regulate emotions, either before or after emotion occurs. A fully functioning and coherent affect regulation performs two functions. One is to attenuate the negative affects and to help the self to process and assimilate the negative experiences and to integrate them. The other is to create positive affect, based on the past life experiences processed, reinforcing the self in problem solving processes. Affect-regulation is the ability of a person to reduce the negative emotions and to create positive ones.The difficulty of emotion recognition causes problems in the emotive state of the individual and of others as well (Zonnevijlle-Bender, van Goozen, Cohen-Kettenis, van Elburg & van Engeland, 2002; Sharpe, Wallis, & Ridout, 2016). The damage or the lack of the cognitive components of emotional response system, such as subjective consciousness, and the ability of emotional narration (defined as alexithymia), is in the background of the regulation deficit. Distrust to interpersonal relationships and lack of awareness are added, too (Nandrino et al., 2006).The literature published on eating disorders shows that anorexic patients have a dysfunctional affect regulation. They are characterized by cognitive biases and extreme focusing on negative affects (Karwautz et al. …",

      "abstract": "Eating disorders (EDs) are conditions which are becoming more and more widespread among adolescents and they often lead them to seek the opinion of a professional health caregiver, including gynecologists and pediatricians. EDs, and particularly anorexia nervosa (AN), are usually classified as psychological or psychiatric disorders, but they may have major somatic implications and complications as osteoporosis, nutritional deficiencies, cerebral atrophy, cardiac and metabolic disorders. A key issue in the management is prevention or reduction of both the serious somatic consequences and the important mental health consequences (e.g. depression, psychosocial withdrawal, phobia and suicide), integrating different perspectives (psychological or psychiatric – individual and familial –, genetic, nutritional, pediatric, gynecological). Adolescence is a critical period for the onset of EDs though they may also involve younger children. In this case, the consequences on the development (height, weight, puberty) can also be significant. In this review, we will focus on eating disorders in adolescent girls with an emphasis on AN. We describe variations in ED characteristics and their management depending on age at occurrence. A possible ED should be considered by pediatricians consulted about delayed female growth and puberty as well as gynecologists in patients with primary or secondary amenorrhea or infertility.",

O bruxismo e classificado como primario ou secundario. O bruxismo primario nao esta relacionado a nenhuma causa evidente, com evolucao a partir do seu aparecimento na infância ou adolescencia para a idade adulta. Ja o bruxismo secundario esta associado com transtornos neurologicos, como na doenca de Parkinson; psiquiatrico, nos casos de depressao; outros transtornos do sono, como a apneia; e uso de drogas, como as anfetaminas. O diagnostico do bruxismo e baseado no relato de ranger de dentes ocorrido durante o sono associado a dor ou tensao nos musculos da face ao acordar. O desgaste anormal dos dentes e a hipertrofia do masseter sao sinais que ajudam no diagnostico. Nao existe tratamento especifico ou cura para o bruxismo do sono. Uma assistencia multiprofissional pode propor diferentes linhas de tratamentos: tratamentos farmacologicos, psicologicos e odontologicos. O tratamento odontologico para o bruxismo e baseado nos ajustes oclusais, restauracao da superficie dentaria, tratamento ortodontico e placas oclusais miorrelaxantes. Objetivos: Explanar sobre o bruxismo do sono e suas complicacoes no sistema estomatognatico. Metodo: Foi realizada uma busca de artigos nacionais e internacionais nas bases de dados Pubmed, Scielo e Google Scholar entre os anos 2012 a 2018 que usaram como descritores as palavras: Bruxismo e bruxismo do sono. Conclusao: O bruxismo do sono ocorre em atividades nao funcionais do sistema estomatognatico e e reconhecido como uma parafuncao do sistema mastigatorio. O aumento de forcas proporcionado pelo bruxismo leva a cargas extras em todo o sistema estomatognatico, sendo que, como possivel resultado dessa situacao, ocorram danos a articulacao temporomandibular (ATM), musculos, periodonto e oclusao. Portanto, cabe ao cirurgiao-dentista conhecer o tema e identificar essa situacao em pacientes para que se recomende o tratamento mais efetivo em cada um deles. Mesmo com o avanco dos estudos acerca do tema, e possivel apenas minimizar seus efeitos deleterios, nao sendo capaz de evitar ou paralisar o bruxismo, mas entende-se que alguns fatores diminuem sua intensidade, enquanto outros a aumentam. Todavia, existe uma dificuldade de compreensao e controle desta parafuncao devido a sua multifatoriedade.",

Pelvic muscle exercises with and without biofeedback training have been shown to decrease episodes of incontinence in stresss incontinent women.

      "abstract": "SUMMARY Mortality and neurological and mental outcome were studied in infants 28 days to 1 year of age with afebrile seizures not due to an acute postnatal injury. Cases were divided into four eizure types: infantile spasms; status epilep‐ticus; and “others” (patients without spasms or status), generalized and partial. Mortality was studied in 334 cases, mental and neurological prognosis in 313 infants followed 1 year or more. Globally the prognosis was very poor even outside cases of infantile spasms. Mortality was higher and mental and neurological sequelae were more common in symptomatic than in cryptogenic cases. The highest mortality and greatest number of neurological defects were in status epilepticus and in “others” partial groups. Severely retarded subjects were more common in infantile spasms and “others” partial. The proportion of mentally normal patients, however, was no different according to ictal type. Mental and neurological prognosis was less unfavorable when the first seizure occurred at or over 6 months. A family history of epilepsy or febrile convulsions (21% of the cases in the whole series) was more common in the “others” subgroups, especially in the cryptogenic “others” (429c). The less unfavorable outcome obtained in cryptogenic “others” generalized with a positive family history. RÉSUMÉ On a étudiea la mortalité et le pronostic neurologique et intellectuel des enfants ayant eu entre L'âge été 28 jours et celui d'un an plusieurs crises épileptiques sans fiàevre, non liées a une atteinte cérébrale aiguë.

RESUMEN Se ha estudiado la mortalidad y la evolución été los estados neurológico y mental en niños été 28 dias a un ano été edad con convulsiones afebriles no debidas a insulto postnatal. Los casos fueron divididos en 4 tipos été ataques: espasmos infantiles, estatus epilepticus, y “otros” generalizados o parciales (enfermos sin espasmos o status). Durante más été un ano se estudié la mortalidad en 334 casos y el pronéstico mental y neurologico en 313 ninos. El pronostico global fué muy pobre incluso en los casos sin espasmos infantiles. La mortalidad fue más alta y las secuelas neurológicas m^s comunes en los casos sintomaticos que en los criptogenicos. La más alta mortalidad y el mayor niimero été defectos neurolbgicos se encontraron en los status epilepticus y en el grupo été“otros” ataques parciales. Los retrasos mentales severos fueron más frecuentes en los espasmos infantiles y en los “otros” ataques parciales pero la proporción été enfermos mentales normales no fue influenciada por el tipo été ataques. El pronéstico mental y neurológico fue menos sombrio cuando el primer ataque ocurri6 a partir été los 6 meses été edad. La historia familiar été epilepsia o été ataques febriles (21% en las series tota‐les) fué m&amp;s comun en el subgrupo été“otros” ataques y especialmente en los criptogenicos (42%). La evolu‐ción menos sombria se observo en el grupo criptogenico été“otros” ataques generalizados con historia familiar positiva. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Die Mortalität, neurologische Folgen und geistige Entwicklung wurden bei Kindern untersucht, die vom 28. Lebenstag bis zum Ende des ersten Jahres afebrile Krämpfe hatten, die nicht Folge einer akuten postna‐talen Schädigung waren. 4 Anfallsmanifestationen wurden unterschieden: “Infantile Spasms,” Status Epilepticus, “andere” (außer den vorgenannten) mit generalisierten bzw. partialen Anfällen. Die Mortalitat wurde bei 334 Patienten untersucht, die geistige und neurologische Prognose bei 313 Kindern ein oder mehrere Jahre verfolgt. Global war die Prognose sehr schlecht sogar wenn man Fälle mit Infantile Spasms unberiicksichtigt läßt. Die Mortalitat war höher, geistige und neurologische Residuen traten häufiger bei symptomatischen als bei kryptogenen Fällen auf. Die höchste Mortalität und die größte Zahl neuro‐logischer Defekte fand man beim Status Epilepticus und bei “anderen” Gruppen mit Partialanfallen. Schwer retardierte Patienten waren häufiger in der Gruppe der jenigen zu finden, die Infantile Spasms und “andere” Partialanfälle boten; aber der Prozent‐satz der geistig altersgemäßen Patienten differierte nicht in Abhängigkeit vom Anfallstyp. Die geistige und neurologische Prognose war ungünstiger, wenn die ersten Anfälle mit oder nach 6 Monaten auftraten. Eine positive familiare Belastung mit épilepsie oder Fieberkrampfen (21% der Fälle der gesamten Serie) fand sich häufiger in den Untergruppen mit “anderen” Anfällen, besonders bei den Patienten mit “anderen” kryptogenen Anfällen (42%). Am besten schnitten von den “anderen” kryptogenen Patienten die mit generalisierten Anfallen und einer positiven Familien‐anamnese ab.",

A comprehensive bladder-retraining program that incorporates appropriate education, training, medication, and surgical interventions can mitigate the adverse consequences of neurogenic bladder dysfunction and improve both quantity and quality of life. The goals of bladder retraining for neurogenic bladder dysfunction are prevention of urinary incontinence, urinary tract infections, detrusor overdistension, and progressive upper urinary tract damage due to chronic, excessive detrusor pressures.

Migren ve beslenme arasında karmaşık bir ilişki mevcuttur. Besinsel tetikleyici faktörler hâlen tartışmalı bir konudur ve değerlendirilmesi bireysel farklılıklar nedeni ile oldukça zordur. Genel olarak açlık veya öğün atlama ciddi bir tetikleyici olmakla beraber; çikolata, kırmızı şarap, peynir, kafein, monosodyum glutamat (MSG), nitrit ve aspartam önemli tetikleyiciler olarak karşımıza çıkmaktadır. Yapılan yeni çalışmalarda, migren tedavisine ek olarak; magnezyum, riboflavin, koenzim Q10 gibi bazı fonksiyonel besinlerin kullanımının migren ataklarının sıklığını, şiddetini ve süresini azaltılabileceği bulunmuştur. Migrenin allerji ile ilişkili olduğu düşünülerek, allerji oluşturan besinlerin diyetten çıkarılmasını kapsayan eliminasyon diyetleri gündeme gelmiştir. Beden kitle indeksi ve migren özellikleri arasındaki ilişki çelişkili olmasına rağmen, çok zayıf ve kilolu olmanın migren nöbetlerini tetikleyebileceğini gösteren bazı çalışmalar mevcuttur. Bu çalışmada, yapılmış güncel araştırmalar ışığında migreni tetikleyen besinler ve bu besinler ile migren nöbetlerinin şiddeti, yoğunluğu ve süresi arasındaki ilişkilerin incelenmesi amaçlanmıştır.",

      "title": "Coexistence of type 1 diabetes mellitus and periventricular heterotopia in a child: A case report",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor, Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is characterized by a chronic, progressive, and immune-mediated destruction of the insulin-producing beta-cells (β-cells) in the pancreatic islets of Langerhans. It may occur in association with other autoimmune diseases involving other endocrine tissues, such as thyroid and adrenal glands, or non-endocrine tissues, such as gastric and intestine mucosa.[1] Heterotopias are malformations of cortical development characterized by the presence of normal brain cells in abnormal positions. They can be classified into three groups, based on their location: periventricular, subcortical, and leptomeningeal. Neurological manifestations have been described, including seizures, mental motor retardation, and neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, and autism.[2] Various diseases that have been reported in association with T1DM include Rett syndrome, neurofibromatosis type 1, Crohn’s disease, celiac disease, glutaric aciduria type 1, and spinal muscular atrophy.[3,4,5,6] Here we report the case of a Turkish 8-year-old boy with T1DM and periventricular heterotopia. An 8-year-old boy presented with partial onset of secondarily generalized seizures. On taking history, the patient was followed by T1DM for 2 years in another hospital. He was born in the 40th gestational week by normal delivery with 3300g of birth weight to consanguineous parents (first cousins). At the age of 6 years, he was diagnosed to have T1DM when he had presented with ketoacidosis. His glycemic control had been optimal with regular insulin therapy. We learned that the patient had a seizure 2 months ago. The serum glucose level at the seizure was found to be 53mg/dL and it was said that the patient’s seizure was thought to be due to hypoglycemia. On examination, vital signs, and the results of physical and neurological examination were found to be normal. The results of laboratory examinations (complete blood cell count, liver enzymes, kidney function parameters, serum electrolytes, and glucose rate) were normal. The patient was administered Levetiracetam (LEV) monotherapy. LEV had started and his seizures were ceased. Interictal electroencephalography showed epileptiform abnormalities in right temporal regions. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed heterotopia in posterior horn of the right lateral ventricle [Figure 1]. Stanford–Binet test was performed and mild intellectual disability was detected.Figure 1: Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain showing heterotopia in the right lateral ventricleSeizure or epilepsy is observed in patients with T1DM. Metabolic abnormalities of diabetes mellitus such as hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia could have a damaging effect on the central nervous system, which may cause seizure; indeed, in endocrine disorders, seizures could be the result of neuroinflammation, autoimmunity, or metabolic disturbances.[7] Focal epilepsy may be the first symptom of diabetes mellitus in some patients, and can lead to the discovery of diabetes mellitus. Some studies also described several transient changes in MRI following seizures. These brain parenchymal changes are typically hyperintense on T2-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images. Nevertheless, some patients without evidence of brain damage have been reported.[8] In sum, during hyperglycemia, a focal reduction in blood flow may occur with consequent focal seizures; however, there is no constant relationship between blood glucose levels and the frequency or severity of neurological symptoms. Also, focal seizures can be symptomatic of structural lesions within the brain.[2] Our patient had diabetes and also periventricular heterotopy. Even if there is T1DM in the focal seizure, should come to mind in structural anomalies of central nervous system. In conclusion, we found a structural abnormality in a diabetic patient with focal seizure. Epilepsy can be a feature of diabetic patients. However, seizures should not be considered to be due solely to metabolic disorders of diabetes. In the presence of seizure, diabetic patients need a multidisciplinary approach that involves pediatric endocrinologists and neurologists to optimize therapeutic management and follow-up.

      "title": "[Comorbidity of eating disorders and bipolar affective disorders].",
      "abstract": "Eating disorders--anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and eating disorders not otherwise specified (EDNOS) occur usually in young females. The significant pathogenic differences between patients who only restrict food, and patients with binge eating and compensatory behaviours, such as vomiting and purging were described. The prevalence of bipolar affective disorders--especially bipolar II and bipolar spectrum disorders (BS) may reach 5% in the general population. About half of the depressive episodes are associated with a \"mild\" bipolar disorder, and such a diagnosis is suggested by impulsivity and mood-instability. Previously, majority of research on the comorbidity between eating and affective disorders focused on depressive symptomatology, however difficulties in the reliable assessment of hypomania may obfuscate the estimation of the co-occurrence of eating disorders with BS. Epidemiological studies suggest the association between BS and eating disorders with binge episodes (bulimia nervosa, anorexia- bulimic type and EDNOS with binge episodes). Co-occurrence of such disorders with depressive symptoms probably suggests the diagnosis of BS, not recurrent depression. Bulimic behaviours, impulsivity and affective disorders might be related to the impairment of the serotonergic neurotransmission, which may result from the genetic vulnerability and early life trauma. Currently, the first-line pharmacological treatment of co-occurring eating disorders with binge episodes and BS are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. However in some cases, the use of mood-stabilising agents as monotherapy or in combination with serotonergic drugs may be helpful.",

In spite of the implicitly wrong conception of reality, the significance of these delusions as an attempt to express, interpret and cope with mental illness should not be neglected if an approach to the patient's own experience is sought. On the one hand, hypochondriacal delusions are based on altered body perceptions in mental illness, characterized by primary local or general dysaesthesias to the point of depersonalisation, or caused secondarily by the patient's increased attention to his own body. This alienated bodily experience is named in (lay) medical terms by the delusional hypochondriac. On the other hand, \"illness\" with its manifold cultural and psychological meanings stands as a polyvalent metaphor for the incomprehensible alteration of the patient's self-experience in general: thus, the feeling of exposure to external attacks, of guilt, sinfulness, shame, loss of self-esteem or even the experience of a disruption of personality may find their expression in the hypochondriacal delusion.",

Desarrollo. Se revisan los sintomas y su posible tratamiento. Conclusiones. El tratamiento en ambos casos se basa en medidas higienicodieteticas evitando sustancias que disminuyan el peristaltismo, farmacos procineticos como domperidona y, en ocasiones, infiltracion de toxina botulinica, estimulacion electrica o incluso tratamiento quirurgico.",

      "abstract": "Delayed post-hypoxic leukoencephalopathy (DPHL) is a demyelinating syndrome characterized by acute onset of neuropsychiatric symptoms days to weeks following apparent recovery from coma after a period of prolonged cerebral hypo-oxygenation. It is diagnosed, after excluding other potential causes of delirium, with a clinical history of carbon monoxide poisoning, narcotic overdose, myocardial infarction, or another global cerebral hypoxic event. The diagnosis can be supported by neuroimaging evidence of diffuse hemispheric demyelination sparing cerebellar and brainstem tracts, or by an elevated cerebrospinal fluid myelin basic protein. Standard or hyperbaric oxygen following CO poisoning may reduce the likelihood of DPHL or other neurologic sequelae. Bed rest and avoidance of stressful procedures for the first 10 days following any prolonged hypoxic event may also lower the risk. Gradual recovery over a 3 to 12 month period is common, but impaired attention or executive function, parkinsonism, or corticospinal tract signs can persist. Stimulants, amantadine or levodopa may be considered for lasting cognitive or parkinsonian symptoms. Anticipation and recognition of DPHL should lead to earlier and more appropriate utilization of health care services.",

O CCL pode ter diversas etiologias, incluindo doenças clínicas mal controladas, polimedicação, depressão, etc; no entanto, em muitos casos corresponde a um estágio ainda incipiente de alguma forma de demência, como a doença de Alzheimer ou demência vascular. Indivíduos com CCL podem apresentar melhora do quadro, estabilização, ou progressão para demência, de acordo com a causa subjacente. O diagnóstico de CCL é baseado em critérios clínicos, e os exames subsidiários tem por objetivo identificar causas tratáveis e tentar identificar os indivíduos com maior risco de conversão para demência. O tratamento é orientado para a doença subjacente ao quadro, quando esta pode ser identificada.

The assessment of SE is based on history (familial predisposition and emotional standpoint), sleep habits, and also on physical examination. There is a strong genetic influence in SE; when both parents suffer from SE, almost 75% of their children are expected to be also enuretic, while the prevalence of SE in the offspring of two parents who were not enuretic during childhood is only 15%. Several polysomnographic studies reported that children with SE have normal sleep architecture, in terms of proportion and distribution of sleep stages during night.

The thresholdto investigate should be lower with older male patients as there is a higher chance of organic disease. o When patients’ symptoms are unclear, a close follow-up and review is useful. Symptoms persisting over manymonths or years are unlikely to have an organic basis. o Explore, understand and address patients’ concerns including psychological problems. Patients need to be reassured. o Sensible advice on food/meal and lifestyle modifications is useful. Antacids often give immediate relief to acutedyspeptic symptoms.

It discusses recognition of EDs and commonly associated medical complications and their management in the acute setting. Patients with EDs are often quite reluctant to disclose their illness to healthcare providers and may present to the emergency department with vague non-specific complaints rather than complaints directly attributable to their ED. Identification and proper management of these patients requires the healthcare provider to maintain a high index of suspicion for these illnesses and to readily recognize signs and symptoms consistent with ED pathology. Common presenting complaints include headache, mood changes, sore throat, dizziness/syncope, palpitations, fatigue/generalized weakness, sports-related or overuse injuries, and gastrointestinal (GI) complaints such as indigestion, abdominal pain, bloating, constipation, and hematemesis. The chapter also provides suggestions for definitive, long-term treatment referral.",

According to the different functions of the body rhythms, the time scale of their periodic activity can vary from seconds (heart) to hours (sleep-awake cycle) to days or months (e.g. menstruation). Moreover, they appear at nearly all levels of morphological organisation, ranging from the intracellular space to tissue and organs. One important feature of rhythmic behaviour is its ability to respond in a characteristic manner to different external requirements.

For bulimia nervosa (BN) the typical age at onset is the period of transition from adolescence to young adulthood. It is present in a large proportion of patients in their 20s but also in their 30s and 40s.

This is a clearly defined and often permanent association of symptoms, which is almost entirely specific to structural lesions of the paramedian craniocervical junction (Cogan 1968). It involves eye-head coordination in the pitch plane, mediated by pathways from the vertical semicircular canals and the otoliths. This is not a pure oculomotor disorder, but a central vestibular disorder that affects perception and balance. Differential diagnoses include gaze-evoked nystagmus, acquired pendular nystagmus, spasmus nutans and rare vertical forms of congenital nystagmus; in coma, downbeat nystagmus should not be confused with ocular bobbing. Downbeat nystagmus differs from these other conditions in that it is a spontaneous jerk nystagmus which is activated by lateral gaze, and is not suppressed by fixation.",

The clinical manifestations of IA are the same as allergen-associated (immunologic) anaphylaxis and include urticaria, angioedema, hypotension, tachycardia, wheezing, stridor, pruritus, nausea, vomiting, flushing, diarrhea, dysphagia, light-headedness, and loss of consciousness. Patients usually tend to have the same manifestations on repeated episodes. IA is a prednisone-responsive disease that is ultimately a diagnosis of exclusion. Approximately 40% of patients are atopic. Serum tryptase (or urine histamine or its metabolite) will be elevated acutely, but, if elevated in the absence of anaphylaxis, should suggest alternative diagnoses, including indolent systemic mastocytosis. A focused history, examination, and follow-up will dictate whether a patient's symptoms may be attributable to disorders that mimic anaphylaxis, such as indolent systemic mastocytosis, carcinoid syndrome, pheochromocytoma, hereditary angioedema or acquired C1 esterase inhibitor deficiency, or panic attacks. The presence of urticaria may help limit the differential diagnosis because urticaria does not usually accompany any of the above-mentioned disorders, except for indolent systemic mastocytosis. IA is classified according to the symptoms as well as the frequency of attacks. Patients who experience six or more episodes in a year, or two or more episodes in 2 months are classified as having IA-frequent (IA-F). Patients who experience fewer episodes are classified as having IA-infrequent (IA-I). This distinction is important because patients with IA-F will initially require prednisone as disease-modifying therapy, whereas most patients who with IA-I will not require prednisone. Patients with IA must carry and know when and how to self-administer epinephrine.",

Por outro lado, existe uma grande variabilidade inter- e intra-individual no que respeita aos factores alimentares desencadeantes. Embora tenha sido demonstrado que uma elevada proporcao de individuos com intolerância alimentar beneficiou consideravelmente com uma intervencao alimentar, o factor alimentar e frequentemente negligenciado a favor da terapia farmacologica preventiva. No entanto, antes de preconizar qualquer tratamento nutricional devem considerar-se as possiveis deficiencias nutricionais e o impacto social que a restricao alimentar pode provocar. Assim, torna-se necessario estabelecer metodologias de diagnostico, tratamento e prevencao para uniformizar a abordagem nutricional do doente com enxaqueca.Palavras-chave: Enxaqueca; inflamacao neurogenica; alimentacao; nutrientes.",

In caring patients with eating disorders, psychiatrists should understand the physical symptoms and signs, medical complications and treatment of acute metabolic derangement. Under the circumstances that it's not easy to have a physician as a member on the therapeutic team of eating disorders, psychiatrists need to facilitate a well structured route of consultation-liaison to a physician who is knowledgeable about eating disorders. Possible important physical signs and complications include electrolyte imbalance, metabolic alkalosis, activation of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, abnormal thyroid hor-mones, amenorrhea, cardiac arrhythmia, leukopenia, diverse esophageal and gastrointestinal problems, salivary gland hypertrophy, osteoporosis, callus, and dental enamel erosion etc. Therefore, routine assessment should include a medical history, a complete physical examination and basic laboratory tests. In addition, depending on a patient's medical history and the result of physical examination, some supplement tests such as CT, MRI, echocardiogram or various types of hormonal tests should also be considered.",

      "abstract": "Sleep-related breathing disorders occur due to the effects of sleep on the central nervous respiratory control system and/or on upper airway (UA) patency. The occurrence of partial or complete UA obstruction during sleep characterizes the obstructive sleep apnea (OSA)/hypopnea syndrome. Breathing (respiration), which is mainly under a behavioral or voluntary control system during awakening, is essentially under a metabolic or automated control system during sleep. The contribution of the thoracic cage to the overall respiration remains the same during wakefulness and nonrapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Considering the importance of the metabolic regulation in the control of respiration during sleep, one can easily speculate that any change in the ventilatory response to hypoxic or hypercapnic stimuli will increase the magnitude of nocturnal hypoventilation episodes. UA are usually patent throughout the respiratory cycle and they behave in a manner similar to that of a Starling resistance model where a collapsible segment (pharynx) is located between two noncollapsible segments.",

In the elderly, it involves a rapid cognitive decline from the preexisting level of functioning (whatever that might be) involving conscious level, orientation, attention, memory and concentration. The mental state fluctuates from minute to minute or hour to hour, often worse in the evenings than mornings. There are perceptual abnormalities (illusions, hallucinations and misrecognition), affective changes (apathy, lability, irritability, autonomic arousal), persecutory or terrifying ideas, behavioral changes (hypokinesis or hyperkinesis), and motor features – ‘plucking’ and pointing are common. It is an unpleasant state with a high mortality and a high risk of adverse iatrogenic consequences. In approximately 85% of recognised cases, one or more physical causes can be identified, for example infection, intoxication with prescribed drugs, and cardiovascular, respiratory and metabolic disease. In the other 15%, psychologic factors such as removal from home, grief, depression or acute psychotic illness are sufficient to precipitate delirium. The risk of delirium appears to rise with age and underlying cerebral disease.",

Vor Beginn einer speziellen Therapie im Hinblick auf die Harninkontinenz muss eine dem Gesamtzustand des Patienten entsprechende Therapie der Multimorbidität und der Demenz erfolgen.

It presents the clinical history, examination, follow-up, treatment, diagnosis, and the results of the procedures performed on the patient. Actigraphic recordings for 2 weeks disclosed persistent muscular activity during the nocturnal period and two to five episodes per night of further enhanced muscular activity that corresponded to the eating episodes noted by the patient in his diary. The sleep medicine specialist established a diagnosis of sleep-related eating disorder (SRED) based on the clinical history and on the results of the video-polysomnography (PSG) recording. Low-dosage dopaminergic agents such as levodopa/carbidopa at bedtime, sometimes combined with codeine and/or clonazepam, bromocriptine and pramipexole, have been shown to reduce the eating episodes.",

The pattern of muscular activity involved with the oral and pharyngeal phases of swallowing is the result of an individual strategy of swallowing, influenced by the anatomic relationships of the upper aerodigestive tract. Children with medical conditions that prevent the normal acquisition of oromotor skills are at risk for developing debilitating swallowing disorders. The evaluation of a child with a significant feeding disorder requires the expertise of a multidisciplinary team to allow an all-inclusive examination of the swallowing process and the development of a comprehensive treatment plan. Early identification of situations that may lead to swallowing disorders offers the opportunity to initiate treatment proactively in order to minimize the major debilitating defects that may develop.",

It can significantly affect an individual's quality of life and overall well-being. Understanding the causes of constipation is important for its effective management and treatment. In this paper, we have reviewed the primary causes of constipation or functional constipation. Primary constipation is a bowel disorder associated with colonic or anorectal sensorimotor or neuromuscular dysfunction. As per the literature, it is multifactorial and involves factors such as decreased interstitial cells of Cajal, altered colonic motility, enteric nervous system dysfunction, intestinal flora disturbances, and psychological influences. Clinical symptoms include difficulty in defecation, decreased frequency of defecation, or a feeling of incomplete evacuation. A comprehensive evaluation and management of constipation require an interdisciplinary approach incorporating dietary modifications, lifestyle changes, pharmacotherapy, and psychological interventions. Further research is imperative to explain the intricate mechanisms underlying constipation and develop targeted therapies for improved patient outcomes.",

      "abstract": "The intricate mechanism of swallowing can be divided into three phases: oral, pharyngeal, and esophageal. Dysphagia is a disruption in the swallowing process, which include difficulty in transporting (or a lack of transporting) a food or liquid bolus from the mouth through the pharynx and esophagus into the stomach. Causes of disruptions in the swallowing process can be divided into superior (oropharyngeal) and inferior (esophageal) according to Paradowski et al. Neurlologic dysphagia may be caused by a disruption in different parts of the central nervous system (supranuclear level, level of motor and sensory nuclei taking part in swallowing process, peripherial nerves level and a pathology of muscle cells and spindles) or neuromuscular and muscular disorders. Neuromuscular disorders causes according to Waśko-Czopnik et al. are: stroke, brain tumors, brain injury, bulbar and pseudobulbar paralysis, neurodegenerative diseases (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis), tabes dorsalis, multisystem degenerations, Parkinson's disease, delayed dyskineses, Huntington's disease, myasthenia and myasthenic syndromes, myopathies and peripherial neuropathies. The correct diagnosis evaluation include history taking, physical examination with palpation and consultations (laryngological, gastrological and neurological). According to Halama radiological esophagogram, videofluoroscopy, flexible endoscopic examination, ultrasound examination, manometry, electromyography, scintigraphy and 24 hour pH monitoring are main diagnostic procedures of dysphagia. Some of the reasons for the neurologic dysphagia may be treated by surgical and pharmacological methods. Neurologic dysphagia rehabilitation is difficult, long-lasting and often falling far short of expected results. Primary it should include neurologic cause treatment if it is possible. According to WHO International Classification of Functioning and Health in 2001 non-invasive methods of dysphagia treatment may be divided into reconstitution, compensatory and adaptive techniques. The most popular reconstitution methods are thermal stimulation (Lazzar's) or tactilethermal application (Rosenbeck's) techniques which may be applied for abnormal duration of stage transition (DST). Abnormal duration of stage transition considerably increase probability of aspiration. Dysphagia treatment by compensatory methods consist in various techniques of swallowing and posture changes application. Adaptive techniques include dietary changes--avoiding of sustenances strengthening dysphagia and adequate dietary intake. The basic principle of dysphagia rehabilitation is that the most effective way to regain efficiency is the regeneration on remains of lost function. Carrying out imperfect swallowing acts is probably the best way of increasing effectiveness and efficiency of swallowing. On the other hand imperfect swallowing acts may be hazardous because of the danger of aspiration and inhalation pneumonia.",

      "abstract": "Time for primary review 28 days.\n\nMore than any other organ of the body, brain integrity depends on the continuous blood supply of oxygen and glucose for covering the energy demands of the tissue. Cessation or severe reduction of blood flow results in almost instantaneous biochemical and functional deficits which become rapidly irreversible unless blood flow is promptly restored. The ischemia time that is tolerated by the brain depends, among others, on the density of ischemia, the tissue concentration of primary and secondary energy stores and the rate of energy consumption which, in turn, depends on the temperature, the degree of functional activity and the absence or presence of anesthetics and other drugs. There is also a major difference between the ischemic vulnerability of different regions of the brain. As an example, the CA1 sector of hippocampus may suffer irreversible injury after ischemia of as short as 5 min [94]whereas other nerve cell populations survive normothermic cerebrocirculatory arrest of as long as 1 h [77].\n\nThe pathophysiology of cerebral ischemia is further complicated by the fact that the severity of cell injury is modulated by numerous indirect or secondary consequences of the primary ischemic impact. Recirculation disturbances, stress responses, peroxidative changes, or the activation of genomic responses are only few examples of the large number of hemodynamic and molecular responses which determine the final outcome [153, 97]. The interpretation of experimental data of cerebral ischemia, therefore, requires intimate knowledge of the models and conditions under which the data have been collected. The number and diversity of such models, has become very large over the years because researchers have sought in vain for the ideal approach to study ischemic injury and its therapeutic reversal. Such an ideal model should be relevant to the clinical situation, it should be … \n\n* Corresponding author. Tel.: +49 (221) 4726 211; Fax: +49 (221) 4726 325; E-mail: hossmann@mpin-koeln.mpg.de",

      "title": "Addressing GI Health Through the Bidirectional Modulation of the Gut-Brain Axis With Herbal Extracts: A Narrative Review",
      "abstract": "Functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) refer to a group of disorders with chronic symptoms, such as abdominal pain, dysphagia, dyspepsia, diarrhea, constipation, and bloating. Among these, functional constipation significantly impacts the quality of life and is linked with comorbidities, such as anxiety and depression. The exact pathophysiology remains unclear despite the widespread occurrence. Research suggests that the gut-brain axis plays a role in FGIDs. Disruptions in the bidirectional communication between the brain and gastrointestinal (GI) tract contribute to GI symptoms and mood disturbances. The incomplete understanding of FGID pathophysiology has led to limited treatment options. Traditional treatments often focus on single symptoms and come with side effects, prompting the need for alternative approaches that address both GI and psychological components. Alternative approaches including herbal supplements offer a natural alternative to conventional medicine by promoting regularity and gut health. Abelmoschus esculentus L. or okra has a history of use in traditional medicine. Bioactive compounds such as polysaccharides and fibers found in okra offer gastroprotective benefits. Withania somnifera is a plant commonly referred to as ashwagandha. The plant root has been used for its health-promoting effects. Research supports the use of W. somnifera to help with stress and sleep. Digexin is a herbal supplement combining W. somnifera (ashwagandha) and A. esculentus (okra). It has shown promise in improving both GI regularity and mood by modulating the gut-brain axis. Clinical studies support the potential of a novel herbal supplement that aids in the management of FGIDs. This narrative review looks at FGIDs, etiologies, current treatment, and possible therapeutic supplements to aid in symptom management.",

      "title": "Approach to History Taking and Examination of the Movement Disorder Patient",
      "abstract": "Abstract Movement disorders can be classified into akinetic–rigid and hyperkinetic categories. The value of a systematic approach to history taking and examination cannot be overstated. For example, taking a detailed family and drug history, or paying close attention to the saccadic eye movements, often produces important information. Cognitive and neuropsychiatric features commonly accompany movement disorders, are often not spontaneously volunteered, and therefore should always be screened for. Sadly, there appears to be an increasing over-reliance on ordering tests indiscriminately in the diagnostic quest, often at the expense of a thorough clinical evaluation. Such an approach is likely to have a low yield, to be potentially misleading, and also to be costly. The key to accurate diagnosis lies in identifying the phenomenology of the movement disorder, set in the context of the historical information obtained (e.g. rate of onset, progression, use of offending drugs), and whether there are additional physical signs to be elicited from the general medical or neurological examination that further narrow down the differential (e.g. organomegaly, eye movement disorder, reflex changes). For intermittent, situational, or task-specific movement disorders, asking the patient to make a video recording on their mobile phone or other device can be invaluable. Alternatively, bringing the relevant piece of equipment to the consulting room (such as a golf club, guitar, etc.) can be illuminating. The implications for other family members should always be borne in mind when undertaking genetic testing. Management should be incremental, engaging the patient in therapeutic decisions wherever possible.",

      "abstract": "All healthcare professionals dealing primarily with physical disorder need a working knowledge of relevant psychological factors and psychiatric dis­orders. Despite the geographical and, often, cul­tural separation of most ‘general’ (i.e. physical) and psychiatric hospitals, there are close links (1) be­tween physical and psychological disorders, and (2) between physical and psychological factors in the aetiology, presentation, and management of all illness. This chapter aims to stimulate you to think about these issues in primary care and in the general hospital, and to equip you with the know­ledge required to think about them in an integrated, biopsychosocial way. The links between physical and psychological fac­tors are multiple. They include: … ● psychiatric and physical disorders occurring together by chance— as they are both common; ● psychiatric disorders causing physical symptoms— for example, depression is associated with low physical energy (anergia), amenorrhoea, and constipation; ● psychiatric disorder adversely affecting the outcome of physical disorder— for example, a depressive disorder might impair self- management of diabetes mellitus, because low motivation is a common symptom of depression, and may reduce adherence to self- monitoring of glucose; ● psychological factors increasing disability associated with physical disorder— for example, if a patient recovering from a myocardial infarction believes that it has led to a permanent reduction in their cardiac function, they are less likely to return to work, to take regular exercise, and to have a normal sex life; ● untreated psychological problems leading to the inappropriate use of medical resources and to poor compliance with medical advice— for example, people with panic disorder are more likely to attend emergency departments with acute ‘cardiac’ symptoms; ● physical symptoms and disorders having psychological consequences, which include psychiatric disorder— for example, hypothyroidism and cerebrovascular disease may lead to depression; ● physical disorder exacerbating unrelated psychiatric symptoms— for example, a viral infection could delay recovery from a depressive disorder, by impairing the person’s usual activities, at work and at home, which would otherwise provide therapeutic distraction and stimulation.",

      "abstract": "Autism is a lifelong neurodevelopmental condition that affects approximately 1 in 31 US children and 1 in 45 US adults; autism spectrum disorder includes a wide range of neurologic diversity, symptoms, challenges, strengths, and abilities. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th ed., text revision criteria for autism spectrum disorder require deficits in three areas of communication and social interaction across multiple settings, with at least two restricted or repetitive behaviors, not explained by another condition, and causing functional impairment. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends screening for autism at ages 18 and 24 months in addition to routine developmental surveillance, whereas screening in adults is not recommended. Diagnosis should include a multidisciplinary team and a multidimensional assessment. Autistic individuals have a 20- to 30-year lower life expectancy than nonautistic people and experience higher rates of many chronic conditions, such as diabetes, epilepsy, gastrointestinal concerns, feeding disorders, and mental health disorders (eg, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, depression, anxiety, schizophrenia). Treatment of children with autism spectrum disorder focuses on minimizing core deficits, maximizing functional independence, and preventing problem behaviors. Pharmacologic therapy may be indicated for related conditions or symptoms, such as sleep disorders, seizures, mental health conditions, behavior problems, and gastrointestinal issues. Melatonin effectively reduces sleep symptoms and improves daytime behaviors with minimal adverse effects. The SPACE (sensory, predictability, acceptance, communication, empathy) framework provides specific interventions that make health care more accessible and affirming to autistic patients.",

      "title": "A Case of Interdose Discontinuation Symptoms With Venlafaxine Extended Release",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: Venlafaxine extended release (XR) is a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor that, like many other antidepressants, may be associated with a discontinuation syndrome. Discontinuation syndromes are, in part, related to drugs with short half-lives1 (eg, for venlafaxine and its metabolite, 5 and 11 hours, respectively). Venlafaxine XR discontinuation symptoms have been clinically reported as soon as 6 hours2 and as long as 9 days3 after discontinuation of the drug, but typically emerge in 1–4 days.4 In one study, the prevalence of typical discontinuation symptoms with venlafaxine XR (eg, dysphoria, headaches, nausea, irritability, emotional lability, sleep disturbance) was 27%.5 However, discontinuation symptoms may be severe6,7 in up to 5% of cases.8 In addition, unexpected symptoms may emerge such as “shock-like sensations,”9 gait difficulties,10 palinopsia (persistent visual images),11 delirium,12 suicidal ideation,13 and hypomania14 or mania.14,15 In the following case, we describe a patient who experienced routine venlafaxine XR discontinuation symptoms within hours of daily dosing.\r\n\r\nCase report. In December 2009, Ms A, a 41-year-old white woman with a history of hypertension and palpitations, was prescribed venlafaxine XR 37.5 mg/d by another primary care provider for the treatment of depression. With a change in primary care providers in January 2011, Ms A promptly discussed her concerns with venlafaxine XR. According to the patient, approximately 2 months after the onset of the venlafaxine XR trial, she began to experience a number of side effects in the absence of any other changes in medication, including nausea, irritability, emotional lability, and, most troublesome, “electrical brain shocks.” Oddly, all of these symptoms occurred on a daily basis, and they consistently emerged approximately 8–10 hours after the administration of the daily dose of venlafaxine XR. Symptoms would then promptly resolve after Ms A took the next dose of venlafaxine XR.\r\n\r\nBecause the patient seemed to be experiencing discontinuation symptoms, she was switched to regular-release venlafaxine 37.5 mg in January 2011, which was dosed twice per day. The regular-release venlafaxine was well tolerated. Within 2 weeks, the patient confirmed that most, if not all, of her symptoms had subsided.\r\n\r\nAlthough discontinuation symptoms from venlafaxine XR have been clinically described by one author in as few as 6 hours after the last dose,2 we are unaware of any actual case reports of venlafaxine XR interdose discontinuation symptoms. This phenomenon may be related to individual genetics and the cytochrome P450 isoenzyme system. Specifically, venlafaxine XR is metabolized by the 2D6 isoenzyme, which is subject to broad genetic polymorphism. In this regard, Zhou16 has described 4 genetic variants: ultrarapid metabolizers, extensive metabolizers, intermediate metabolizers, and poor metabolizers, which constitute 3%–5%, 70%–80%, 10%–17%, and 5%–10% of white individuals, respectively. It is possible that our patient was an ultrarapid metabolizer and briskly eliminated venlafaxine XR through the 2D6 isoenzyme, resulting in interdose discontinuation symptoms.\r\n\r\nAs for clinical approaches to interdose discontinuation symptoms, venlafaxine XR or regular-release venlafaxine may be dosed twice per day, or a patient might be switched to an antidepressant that is less dependent on 2D6 metabolism, such as sertraline, citalopram, or mirtazapine.17 To conclude, to our knowledge, this is the first case report of interdose discontinuation symptoms with venlafaxine XR.",

It is more likely that head injury can sometimes unmask an underlying predisposition to another neuropsychiatric disease that has already begun to manifest, often sub-clinically. Such unmasking may occur as a result of a brain injury superimposed on an already vulnerable brain, or a brain injury that contextually removes the individual from a routine that served as a reliable and dependable structural context. Thus, when abrupt neuropsychiatric manifestations such as psychosis or dementia manifest after concussion, a thorough neuropsychiatric evaluation should be performed, and one should not simply assume that concussion is the cause.",

Generally IBS is more prevalent in women and people with higher educational and social background, but there are some controversies. IBS is diagnosed by the Rome II or Manning criteria after excluding organic gastrointestinal diseases. The pathophysioloy is explained by abnormal control mechanism of central and enteric nervous system. Mucosal immunity, secretions, and neurotransmitter are also associated with the hypersensitivity and motility change of bowel function. Stress is known as a major triggering factor and contributed to symptoms.

      "abstract": "In den ICD–10 findet sich das pathologische Spielen in der Diagnoseklasse F63: Abnorme Gewohnheiten und Störungen der Impulskontrolle. Dabei handelt es sich um eine Restklasse der Restklasse, der auch andere, wenig mit ihr gemein habende Störungen, wie z.B. die Pyromanie, die Kleptomanie und die Trichotillomanie zugerechnet werden. Psychopathologische Analysen sowie klinische Erfahrungen zeigen, dass es sich beim pathologischen Spielen um eine weit über eine Impulskontrollstörung hinausreichende Erkrankung handelt; viele der an ihr leidenden Menschen weisen alle Zeichen einer Abhängigkeitsstörung auf. Es wird daher vorgeschlagen das pathologische Spielen und Wetten in den ICD–11 den Abhängigkeitserkrankungen zuzuordnen und nach folgenden Kriterien zu diagnostizieren: 1. Ein starker Wunsch oder eine Art Zwang zu spielen bzw. zu wetten. 2. Verminderte Kontrollfähigkeit bezüglich des Beginns, der Beendigung und der Dauer des Spielens bzw. Wettens. 3. Auftreten eines Entzugssyndroms bei Beendigung oder Reduktion des Spielens bzw. Wettens, nachgewiesen durch suchtspezifische Entzugssymptome oder durch die Aufnahme der gleichen oder einer nahe verwandten Tätigkeit, um Entzugssymptome zu mildern oder zu vermeiden. 4. Nachweis einer Toleranz. um die ursprünglich durch niedrige Dosen erreichten Wirkungen des Spielens bzw. Wettens hervorzurufen, sind zunehmend höhere Dosen erforderlich (ein Beispiel hierfür sind die steigenden „Tagesdosen“ von Spielern, die bei Konsumenten ohne Toleranzentwicklung schon zu einem Aufhören wegen schwerer Beeinträchtigungen, wie z.B. psycho-soziale, finanzielle oder Beziehungsprobleme, führen würden). 5. Vernachlässigung von Interessen zugunsten des Spielens, erhöhter Zeitaufwand, um zu spielen bzw. zu wetten, bzw. entsprechende finanzielle Mittel zu beschaffen, oder sich von den Folgen zu erholen. 6. Anhaltendes Spielen bzw. Wetten trotz Nachweises eindeutiger schädlicher Folgen, wie z.B. finanzieller Schädigung durch exzessives Spielen.",

      "abstract": "Memory is the cognitive domain most vulnerable to brain injury. Accordingly, the research literature on memory impairment in brain damage is vast, but most of it concerns deficits that occur after the time of brain injury (or the presumed onset of degenerative disease), that is, anterograde amnesia. Much less is known about the ability of patients to recollect information acquired prior to the onset of disease, yet the practical consequences of marked impairments in remote memory (i.e. retrograde amnesia) are likely to be more serious for an elderly person with dementia than are equally severe anterograde memory deficits. Specifically, a patient's complete failure to remember any of the items on a grocery list does not meaningfully increase the caregiver's burden, because the patient would not be expected to do the shopping anyway. By contrast, if the dementia patient repeatedly wanders away from home and cannot remember how to return (a failure of remote visuospatial memory), the burden on the caregiver is great and institutionalization of the patient is a likely consequence.",

      "abstract": "This chapter is concerned with disorders in eating habits, with particular reference to anorexia. Eating disorders are increasingly being diagnosed and are more frequent in girls than boys. The faulty development of the function of receiving may be the consequence of intense and persisting feelings of pain that have roots in the infant's first year of life. This situation is exacerbated by a lack of understanding and containment by the primary object and especially by projections, deriving from the mother's mind, steeped in depression and anxiety. They are therefore dreams that can easily be interpreted. Although they are stimulated by the relationship with the therapist, it is difficult to connect them to this relationship, as these dreams seemed to be produced more to hinder access to the transference situation rather than to offer access to it. Paradoxically, representation was not used so much in order to maintain and give meaning to sensations, but rather with a function that opposes introjection.",

      "abstract": "An eating disorder is a type of psychiatric illness where the behavioural pattern of an individual, with regards to eating, negatively affects his or her mental and physical health. One of these disorders is bulimia nervosa, also known simply as bulimia. Bulimia is characterized by the classic cycle of binge eating followed by purging. This diagnosis in itself can be challenging to make because it involves careful consideration of other disorders and fulfilment of certain criteria according to DSM. Although many different theories exist about the etiology of the disease, no agreement has still been reached in the scientific community. Both biological factors, in terms of neurotransmitters and hormones, as well as social factors, specifically unique to each individual, seem to play a role in the etiology. Treatment primarily involves psychotherapy, however, pharmacologic therapy has also been proven to be beneficial. Of all the different drugs available for treatment of the disease, current psychopharmacological research has focused on the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Some researchers have also claimed positive outcomes in light therapy. Bulimia is a serious disorder and should not be taken lightly. Just like any other serious condition, it should be approached with the same intensity for diagnosis and treatment.",

      "abstract": "In the study of the instances of the disease which I have just described, it was most clearly evident from their pathological course that their existence was intimately connected with a disturbance of some kind in the nervous system, and essentially dependent upon it. In both predisposition existed, in so far that the one (Case I.) the woman was worn out with anxiety, want of rest, etc., from nursing the member of her family who died just before the first attack of the disease, she was hysterical and nervous; in the other (Case II.) he had been subjected for years to severe responsibilities, cares, and worries, which had impaired his general health. In Case I, complete recovery took place after a certain length of time, and she remained well, until experiencing another mental emotion and shock—from business reverses—a relapse occurred. From this time on, every relapse slight or great, every recrudescence of the cutaneous symptoms, subjective or objective, could be traced to some such slight or severe mental emotion or impression, or increased worry, or care, or anxiety and furthermore the grade of the relapse, whether transient or grave, varied according to the grade of the emotion, shock, or other disturbance received. It was also constantly seen how objective manifestations constantly followed immediately upon neuralgic pains, or a hemicrania or some other evidence of sensory innervation. Still more conclusive, perhaps, of the neurotic character of the disease was the observation that diminution in the severity of the subjective and objective manifestations occurred in proportion as the patient's morale improved, and the final cessation of the pathological symptoms and entire quiescence of the disease were only obtained when the changed circumstances of the patient's life protected her against the occurrence of mental emotions or shocks and precluded the experience of annoyances, worries, or cares.

      "abstract": "Sleep difficulties are often leading symptoms of psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, several longitudinal studies have demonstrated that untreated insomnia predicts the onset of mental health disorders. Other sleep disorders also often cause mood and/or anxiety symptoms. Furthermore, overlapping symptoms of sleep apnea, a sleep disorder with undoubted public health significance, and depression merits special attention. Sleep disorders have profound effect on daytime functioning causing daytime sleepiness, tiredness, fatigue and impaired cognitive functioning. These symptoms may severely affect both the quality of life of the patient and also the sleep and quality of life of their bedpartners and family members, as well. It is increasingly appreciated that the majority of medically ill patients suffer from sleep disorders and sleep complaints, which contribute to their impaired quality of life and clinical outcomes. “Sleep Health” is an important aspect of everyone's life but has a special relevance in mentally or medically ill patients. In our studies focusing on patients with various stages of chronic kidney disease (moderate to severe chronic renal failure, patients on dialysis and kidney transplant recipients) we have found high prevalence of sleep disorders (insomnia, Restless Legs Syndrome, Periodic Leg Movements in Sleep, Sleep apnea). We have shown that they are associated with the presence of depressive symptoms, increased illness intrusiveness and worse quality of life. Furthermore, RLS predicted mortality of kidney transplant recipients. In my presentation I will cover the most important aspects of the complex relationship between sleep disorders, mental and physical health and quality of life.",

This theory gains plausibility from the well-known fact that there are many substances which, if introduced into the circulation of an animal either by ingestion through the alimentary tract or by hypodermic injection, can cause epileptiform seizures, and that some of these substances are analogous or even identical in composition with some of the products which are constantly formed in the animal organism in the course of normal metabolic changes. Further corroboration of this theory is found in the fact that disorders of the excretory organs, especially of the kidneys, such as bring about a retention of excretory substances, frequently give rise to epileptiform convulsions.

      "abstract": "Regulation of gut motility is complex and involves neuromuscular, immune and environmental mechanisms. It is well established that patients with celiac disease (CD) often display gut dysmotility. Studies have shown the presence of disturbed esophageal motility, altered gastric emptying, and dysmotility of the small intestine, gallbladder and colon in untreated CD. Most of these motor abnormalities resolve after a strict gluten-free diet, suggesting that mechanisms related to the inflammatory condition and disease process are responsible for the motor dysfunction. Motility abnormalities are also a hallmark of functional bowel disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), where it has been proposed as underlying mechanism for symptom generation (diarrhea, constipation, bloating). Non-celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS) is a poorly defined entity, mostly self-diagnosed, that presents clinically with IBS symptoms in the absence of specific celiac markers. Patients with NCGS are believed to react symptomatically to wheat components, and some studies have proposed the presence of low-grade inflammation in these patients. There is little information regarding the functional characterization of these patients before and after a gluten-free diet. A study suggested the presence of altered gastrointestinal transit in NCGS patients who also have a high prevalence of nonspecific anti-gliadin antibodies. Results of an ongoing clinical study in NCGS patients with positive anti-gliadin antibodies before and after a gluten-free diet will be discussed. Elucidating the mechanisms for symptom generation in NCGS patients is important to find new therapeutic alternatives to the burden of imposing a strict gluten-free diet in patients who do not have CD.",

      "abstract": "About one third of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) experience hallucinations, mostly of a complex visual type, less often auditory or tactile. Minor hallucinatory phenomena, including sense of presence, passage hallucinations and visual illusions are frequent. Hallucinations primarily occur in a context of clear sensorium in patients with longstanding PD. They are more frequent in the evening or during the night. Insight in the hallucinatory nature of the phenomenon may be retained, partial, fluctuating, or abolished. An altered insight is common when cognitive impairment is present, and may be associated with delusions and (or) delusional misidentifications. Pharmacological factors such as dopaminergic treatment clearly trigger or increase the occurence of hallucinations in PD. However, in the recent years, emphasis has been made on disease-related factors including cognitive impairment, diurnal somnolence, visual disorders (either contrast and color discrimination impairment due to PD, or coincident ocular disorders), long duration of PD, late onset, severe axial impairment and autonomic dysfunction. The pathophysiology of hallucinations of PD is poorly understood but is likely to be multifactorial. The first steps of the treatment consist in giving information and reassurance to the patient and his/her caregiver, re-evaluating the antiparkinsonian treatment and associated medications, and evaluating the patient for mood disorder, visual impairment, and cognitive impairment. Cholinesterase inhibitors, when prescribed for associated cognitive impairment, may be beneficial on hallucinations. In the more severe forms, clozapine has been proved to be safe and effective.",

Such formulations provide an opportunity for product line extension in the many elderly persons will have difficulties in taking oral dosage forms (viz., solutions, suspensions, tablets, and capsules) because of hand tremors and dysphasia.

      "abstract": "Objetivo: Analisar as características da Anorexia Nervosa (AN) e da Bulimia Nervosa (BN). Revisão bibliográfica: A BN é caracterizada por episódios de comer compulsivo associado a uma sensação de falta de controle comendo demais durante o episódio. Esses episódios são tipicamente seguidos de culpa e vergonha, que desencadeiam comportamentos compensatórios para evitar o ganho de peso. A AN é distinta como uma condição de auto-inanição, em que as pessoas estão abaixo do peso e se envolvem em comportamentos para evitar o ganho de peso. Estes distúrbios se relacionam a uma série de parâmetros socioculturais, fatores familiares, afeto negativo, baixa autoestima e insatisfação corporal. Considerações finais: A anorexia nervosa e a bulimia são os principais transtornos alimentares, nas quais os indivíduos mais afetados do sexo feminino. Os dois distúrbios tem um alto prejuízo, afetando o funcionamento social, psicológico e ocupacional de uma pessoa de tal forma que seu impacto pode persistir muito além do próprio transtorno. O tratamento de primeira linha para ambas as condições é a terapia cognitivo-comportamental, além disso, para a bulimia há uma opção farmacológica, a fluoxetina.",

      "abstract": "Purpose: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is frequently yet little understood disease. Review was performed to promote understanding on the characteristics, pathophysiology, and risk factors of IBS. Content: IBS is characterized by abdominal discomfort associated with pain and altered bowel function; structural and biochemical abnormalities are absent. Generally IBS is more prevalent in women and people with higher educational and social background, but there are some controversies. IBS is diagnosed by the Rome II or Manning criteria after excluding organic gastrointestinal diseases. The pathophysioloy is explained by abnormal control mechanism of central and enteric nervous system. Mucosal immunity, secretions, and neurotransmitter are also associated with the hypersensitivity and motility change of bowel function. Stress is known as a major triggering factor and contributed to symptoms. Other risk factors are genetic elements, childhood experiences, inflammation, anxiety, depression, diet, and sleep disorders.",

      "title": "Hypokalemic Periodic Paralysis",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Hypokalemic periodic paralysis (hypoPP) is a condition in which affected individuals may experience paralytic episodes with concomitant hypokalemia (serum potassium Some individuals have only one episode in a lifetime; more commonly, crises occur repeatedly: daily, weekly, monthly, or less often. The major triggering factors are cessation of effort following strenuous exercise and carbohydrate-rich evening meals. Additional triggers can include cold, stress/excitement/fear, salt intake, prolonged immobility, use of glucosteroids or alcohol, and anesthetic procedures. The age of onset of the first attack ranges from two to 30 years; the duration of paralytic episodes ranges from one to 72 hours with an average of nearly 24 hours. Long-lasting interictal muscle weakness may occur in some affected individuals and in some stages of the disease and in myopathic muscle changes. A myopathy may occur independent of paralytic symptoms and may be the sole manifestation of hypoPP. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of hypoPP is established in a proband who meets the consensus diagnostic criteria based on a history of attacks of muscle weakness associated with documented serum potassium In the case of long-lasting interictal flaccid muscle weakness, imaging techniques can inform on the pathogenesis, potential therapy, and prognosis. Muscle ultrasound and muscle 1H-MRI are reliable image techniques with high accuracy for the disease. The weakness can be caused by edemas, fatty muscle degeneration, and muscle atrophy or a combination of these pathologies. Management Treatment of manifestations. Treatment varies depending on the intensity and duration of the paralytic attack. Minor attacks may resolve spontaneously. Moderate attacks may be self-treated in a non-medical setting by ingestion of oral potassium salts. Severe attacks typically require more intensive medical management with intravenous potassium infusion, serial measurement of serum potassium concentration, clinical evaluation of possible respiratory involvement, and continuous electrocardiogram monitoring. There is no known curative treatment for hypoPP-related myopathy; physiotherapy may help to maintain strength and motor skills. Prevention of primary manifestations. The goal of preventive treatment is to reduce the frequency and intensity of paralytic attacks. This may be achieved by avoidance of triggering factors, adherence to a diet low in sodium and carbohydrate and rich in potassium, and with the use of oral potassium supplementation. If dietary intervention and oral potassium supplementation are not effective in preventing attacks, treatment with a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor (acetazolamide or dichlorphenamide) may be necessary. If carbonic anhydrase inhibitors are not tolerated or not effective after prolonged use, alternatives include potassium-sparing diuretics such as triamterene, spironolactone, or eplerenone. Prevention of secondary complications. Creating a safe environment, getting help in case of paralytic attack, and preventing falls and accidents are critical; an affected person experiencing a paralytic attack must have access to potassium as well as physical assistance and companions must be informed of the risk in order to enable rapid treatment. Anesthetic complications should be prevented by strict control of serum potassium concentration, avoidance of large glucose and salt load, maintenance of body temperature and acid-base balance, and careful use of neuromuscular blocking agents with continuous monitoring of neuromuscular function. It is unknown whether prevention of paralytic attacks also prevents the development of myopathy. Individuals with known pathogenic variants in one of the genes associated with hypoPP who developed myopathy without having experienced episodes of weakness have been reported. Surveillance. The frequency of consultations is adapted to the individual's signs/symptoms and response to preventive treatment. Periodic neurologic examination with attention to muscle strength in the legs should be performed to detect long-lasting weakness associated with myopathy. For those taking acetazolamide, the following are indicated every three months: complete blood count; electrolytes; and glucose, uric acid, and liver enzyme levels. Renal ultrasound should be performed annually. Agents/circumstances to avoid. Factors that trigger paralytic attacks (e.g., unusually strenuous effort, carbohydrate-rich meals or sweets, cold, stress/excitement/fear, high salt intake, prolonged immobility, oral or intravenous glucosteroids, certain anesthetic procedures, alcohol) should be avoided when possible. Evaluation of relatives at risk. When the family-specific pathogenic variant is known, molecular genetic testing of at-risk asymptomatic family members can identify those at risk for unexpected acute paralysis and/or possible anesthetic complications. Genetic counseling HypoPP is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Most individuals diagnosed with hypoPP have an affected parent. The proportion of cases caused by a de novo pathogenic variant is unknown. Offspring of a proband are at a 50% risk of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Penetrance is about 90% in males and reduced in females. Once the pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

      "title": "Somatization",
      "abstract": "Somatization is defined as the process whereby physical symptoms are experienced in response to stress (Lipowski 1988). Examples include a tension headache or a gastrointestinal symptom (such as abdominal pain, nausea, or diarrhea) that is triggered or exacerbated by a stressful event (such as a school test or a family argument). The most frequently reported symptoms experienced via somatization are pain, gastrointestinal and/or neurological. It is important to recognize that an underlying illness or injury can itself be a significant stressor that triggers or exacerbates somatization. For example, a child with epilepsy might also have non-epileptic seizures, or a child with cancer might get nauseated in anticipation of a hospital admission for chemotherapy.Somatization is not intentional; it is an automatic or habitual physical and behavioral response to stress. While it is possible with training and practice to gain some control over one’s symptoms, somatization is not equivalent to falsifying symptoms (as one might see in malingering or a factitious disorder). Therefore, to simply suggest that one cease somatizing is not helpful.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive symptoms such as poor memory and concentration represent a common cause of morbidity among patients presenting to general practitioners and may result in referral for a neurological opinion. In many cases, these symptoms do not relate to an underlying neurological disease or dementia. In this article we present a personal perspective on the differential diagnosis of cognitive symptoms in the neurology clinic, especially as this applies to patients who seek advice about memory problems but have no neurological disease process. These overlapping categories include the following 'functional' categories: 1) cognitive symptoms as part of anxiety or depression; 2) \"normal\" cognitive symptoms that become the focus of attention; 3) isolated functional cognitive disorder in which symptoms are outwith 'normal' but not explained by anxiety; 4) health anxiety about dementia; 5) cognitive symptoms as part of another functional disorder; and 6) retrograde dissociative (psychogenic) amnesia. Other 'non-dementia' diagnoses to consider in addition are 1) cognitive symptoms secondary to prescribed medication or substance misuse; 2) diseases other than dementia causing cognitive disorders; 3) patients who appear to have functional cognitive symptoms but then go on to develop dementia/another neurological disease; and finally 4) exaggeration/malingering. We discuss previous attempts to classify the problem of functional cognitive symptoms, the importance of making a positive diagnosis for the patient, and the need for large cohort studies to better define and manage this large group of patients.",

Degenerative and vascular diseases involving the central nervous system (CNS) may impair sleep either as a result of the brain lesion or because of illness-related discomfort (motor immobility, social and familial impairment, depression, drugs). Some neurological conditions characterized by movement disorders that start or persist during sleep hinder sleep onset and/or sleep continuity, causing a poor sleep complaint. CNS lesions and/or dysfunction in three specific neurological conditions (fatal familial insomnia, Morvan's chorea, and delirium tremens) impair the basic mechanisms of sleep generation inducing a syndrome in which the inability to sleep is consistently associated with motor and sympathergic overactivation.

Not all patients with AD will develop ALD. 2. Most, but not all patients, with ALD will be AD. 3. Approximately 75-80% of ALD LT patients have AD. B. Diagnostic criteria of alcohol use disorders. 1. Alcohol abuse. a. Clinically important impairment or distress repeatedly in one or more of the following items in a 12-month period. i. Failure to fulfill major obligations (e.g., absences/suspension from work, neglecting household duties). ii. Physically hazardous (e.g., driving while intoxicated). iii. Legal problems (e.g., disorderly conduct, arrest for driving while intoxicated). iv. Social/interpersonal problems (e.g., arguments with spouse about drinking, physical fights). b. Approximately 60% continue with abuse; only 10% go on to develop AD. 2. Diagnostic criteria of AD. a. Clinically important impairment or distress in 3 or more of the following in a 12-month period. i. Tolerance (e.g., increased amount needed for effect, diminished effect). ii. Withdrawal (e.g., autonomic hyperactivity, tremor, or use to avoid withdrawal). iii. Larger amounts/longer period than intended. iv. Persistent desire/unsuccessful attempts to cut down. v. Excessive time spent with alcohol (e.g., spending all of spare time at bar or recovering from effects of alcohol). vi. Activities given up as a result of alcohol (social, occupational, recreational activities give up to use alcohol instead—e.g., preferring to drink instead of attending son's baseball game). vii. Continued use despite problems (e.g., knowing of physical disease such as liver disease or psychological problem such as depression caused or worsened by alcohol use). b. Most LT candidates with ALD meet diagnostic criteria for AD (∼75-80%). c. Nearly 70% of our alcohol-dependent LT cohort endorsed ≥4 of these criteria (when they were active in their addiction before LT). d. Lifetime prevalence of AD is approximately 4%. LT, liver transplantation; ALD, alcoholic liver disease; AD, alcohol dependence; HCV, hepatitis C virus. A. First use of alcohol typically begins early with the development of dependence by early adulthood. 1. AD remains stable over years (unless a patient abstains). 2. Associated with a 10-15-year decrease in life span for a variety of health reasons (including, trauma, suicide). 3. Most (nearly 75%) of those with AD never receive treatment. 4. Physicians need to screen for alcohol consumption and refer AD patients for treatment. B. AD is a chronic medical disorder. 1. Heritability estimates from twin studies indicate that a 60% variance of risk is genetic (heterogeneous and polygenic). 2. Risk factors reflect familial/genetic factors and environment and personal choice. 3. Dependence has a distinct pathophysiology. 4. Effects on brain circuitry. a) Alcohol/drugs either directly or indirectly acutely activate mesolimbic dopamine-rich reward system. b) Prolonged use→changes in brain function. i. Brain metabolic activity. ii. Receptor availability. iii. Gene expression. iv. Responsiveness to environmental cues. c. Unclear whether changes return to normal with abstinence. 5. Changes in brain circuitry→increased difficulty changing alcohol behavior. a. Pairing of person/places/things/specific emotions→rapid and entrenched learning/conditioning. b. May elicit cravings even after long abstinence. C. Treatment is effective. 1. Goals. a. Minimize symptoms/exacerbations. b. Maximize function (physical, social, and role function). c. Treatment requires chronic care and monitoring. i. Insurance restrictions often limit covered services. ii. Emphasis is on acute care rather than ongoing treatment or on the process of relapse to prevent recurrence. 2. Treatment does not cure but reduces symptoms/improve functioning. 3. Longer treatment course more effective. i. Marked decrease in alcohol use in persons in treatment <3 months. Alcohol: long-term residential program lowered 35%, outpatient lowered 65%. ii. Much lowered use if in treatment ≥6 months. Alcohol: long-term residential program/outpatient lowered 75%-80%. A. The percentage of those receiving LT for ALD with or without hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been relatively stable, if not slightly decreasing over the past decade representing 15-20% of all U.S. LTs. B. Patients with ALD are not proportionally represented among LT recipients. ALD accounts for: 1. Thirty percent of all liver deaths in United States. 2. Only 15% of all LTs in the United States. C. AD is a chronic medical illness that spans decades. 1. After ≥10 years of AD, as few as 20-35% will be abstinent for 1 year. 2. Patients with ALD often drink in a heavy, sustained pattern for 10-20 years. 3. Patients referred for transplant often, but not always, have a sustained period of sobriety. D. Patients with AD have greater odds of having: 1. Mood disorder (mostly depression)—4× risk. 2. Drug dependence—37× risk. 3. Nicotine dependence—6.4× risk. E. Our cohort of 208 ALD LT patients. 1. Predominately white men, average age 51 years. 2. Nearly 75% AD. 3. Approximately 60% family history of alcohol use disorder. 4. Seventeen percent depressive disorder. 5. Forty-one percent used drugs in addition to alcohol (38% used intravenous drugs). 6. Nearly 75% used nicotine (smoked or smokeless). 7. Eight percent sober for ≥1 year. 8. Forty-five percent attended addiction rehabilitation. 9. Many similarities to the AD population in general. A. Time to specific alcohol use outcomes by 5 years after LT in a cohort. 1. Any alcohol use—43% had had at least one drink. 2. Binge use—27% had at least a single binge episode (defined as ≥6 drinks per occasion). 3. Frequency use—20% had at least a 1-week period that included 4 days of drinking. 4. Drinking most often began within the first post-LT year but could begin even after ≥4 years of post-LT sobriety. B. Those who took a first drink were at very high risk to continue drinking and to escalate to other, more serious patterns of use. Sixty percent who took a first drink eventually went on to have a binge episode. Additionally, for 20%, their first drink was a binge episode, highlighting the quick loss of control over drinking. For this reason, we recommend no alcohol at all, not even a single drink for a special occasion. C. Drinking trajectories—demonstrating the quantity, frequency, and duration of alcohol consumption. 1. Seventy-one percent either were complete abstainers or drank very minimally on 1-2 occasions. 2. Sixteen percent drank minimally to moderately rarely to occasionally. 3. Only 7% developed an escalating heavy drinking pattern. 4. Five percent drank moderately over time. D. Predictors of post-LT alcohol use—predicted the time to onset of specific alcohol outcomes and the moderate to high drinking trajectories. 1. Diagnosis of AD was associated with a 2.8× greater likelihood of alcohol use. 2. Each month of pre-LT sobriety conferred a lesser risk to drink (21% less risk for each month sober). 3. Addiction rehabilitation was associated with a 2× greater likelihood to use alcohol. We interpreted this to mean that patients who required addiction rehabilitation in order to stop drinking before LT (compared with those who stopped on their own) had a more severe form of the addiction. 4. First-degree biologic relative with an alcohol use disorder was associated with a 1.5× greater risk. E. There was no specific clinical cutpoint for pre-LT length of sobriety that would have high sensitivity and specificity in determining those unlikely to drink. 1. Months of pre-LT sobriety conferred less risk in a linear fashion. 2. Similar to what is seen in the general AD population, the longer the sobriety, the less risk to drink. 3. In the general AD population, stable sobriety is measured in years, not months. F. Survival up to 7 years after LT was not different between groups based on drinking outcomes. Our survival data are comparable to United Network for Organ Sharing survival data. G. Causes of death. 1. For recurrent diseases, 48% of our cohort was infected with hepatitis B virus and/or HCV. Fifteen died of recurrent HCV, with a mean survival of 3.3 years. 2. Thirteen died of cancer; mean survival was 3.5 years. Seven cancer deaths were most likely from tobacco exposure (lung and throat cancers in smokers/chewers). 3. Five died of alcohol-related causes; mean survival was 4 years. A. AD LT recipients share the same general characteristics of those with AD in the general population. 1. We have patients with complex histories, early onset, family histories of AD, comorbid drug use, depression, and tobacco use histories. a. We are selecting patients for LT with long sobriety. b. In the general AD population, this represents only a small percentage: 20-35% who had AD for 10-20 years and were 1 year sober. c. Members of our cohort were more likely to have attended addiction rehabilitation before LT. B. Outcomes are very good. 1. Most (71%) were completely or nearly completely abstainers. 2. Only 12% returned to a pattern of repeated drinking (only 7% in the heaviest repeated pattern of use). Many of these patients sought help for their addiction. 3. Few died as the result of alcohol consumption. 4. Patients in our cohort were more likely to die of recurrent HCV or cancer. C. Suggest considering recruiting patients from the still alcohol-dependent population if they can. 1. Begin active addiction treatment. 2. Have adequate support (family and LT team) for ongoing addiction treatment. 3. Demonstrate abstinence. 4. Recall that 75% of AD population never get treatment for their addiction. We could improve the course of their AD and medical outcome by identifying these patients and referring them for assessment and addiction treatment.

Clinical/neurological examination does not confirm any organic basis for the symptoms. Conversion disorders are more frequent in girls than in boys. They are rarely seen below the age of seven. A correspondence is often found between the personality of the child, (a conscientious attitude) and family relations. The families seem quite normal, but often have high expectations of their children, are sensitive to social stigmatization and have an underlying anxiety for health problems. A model is often found for the child's symptoms. Symptoms may be precipitated by an infection or a physical trauma. Sexual abuse is sometimes discovered. Multiprofessional assessment and treatment by a neuropediatrician, physiotherapist, child psychiatrist/psychologist and educational therapist may reduce \"doctor shopping\" and contribute to a favourable outcome.",

Any of these situations might merit referral to an ENT. Excessive sensitivity to sound can be due to migraine, damage to the ear and auditory nerve, or neuropathic pain. Consider trials of migraine abortive agents and neuropathic pain agents. For tinnitus, assess for medications that adversely affect the inner ear and reduce them if possible. Test thyroid function. Consider an MRI scan of the brain to make sure that the concussion didn’t unmask another problem such as a tumor or vascular malformation. A complaint of hearing loss can reflect true hearing loss due to middle or inner ear damage, attention deficit, or a language problem such as aphasia. Test for these conditions.",

Many of the eating disorder patients also have diagnoses of affective disorders, psychoactive substance abuse, and severe personality disorders. While this suggests that the clinician treating these patients may be faced with the challenge of treating an individual who has become quite dysfunctional, the clinician is also faced with shortened lengths of stay and a relatively brief time period to treat the individual in a hospital setting. The role of the hospital in the treatment of all psychiatric patients, including those with eating disorders, has changed considerably over the last several years. Associated with this change is a need to reevaluate treatment programs and, in particular, the goals of hospital treatment.",

      "title": "Geriatric Seizures",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: Seizures have been defined as an intermittent derangement of the central nervous system due to a sudden, excessive, disorderly discharge of the cerebral neurons. The discharge results in an almost instantaneous disturbance of sensation, convulsive movements, altered or impaired cognition, or some combination thereof.1 Although seizures originating in patients aged 65 and older were once considered to be rare, they are remarkably frequent, with an incidence rate higher than 100 in 100,000. On an age-specific basis, other than the neonatal period, the highest incidence of new onset seizures occurs in the population aged 65 and older.2 Clinically, geriatric seizures are not different from those of children, adolescents, and younger adults, except for petit mal siezures, which almost never originate in older persons.3 Moreover, onset of seizures after aged 65 years and older is more often symptomatic and associated with injury than in younger individuals.4 The incidence of late-onset seizure progressively increases with each decade beyond age 60 (see Table 1).5 The etiology of this occurrence depends to a large extent on age and “cognitive integrity.”6 The most common etiologies of geriatric seizures include, with ranges of frequency, cerebrovascular disease (11%–54%), undetermined, (13%–43.5%), brain neoplasm (2.1%–33%), multifactorial etiology (6%–20%), head trauma (4.3%–21%), Alzheimers disease (9.1%–17%), metabolic disorders (6.5%–10%), and central nervous system infection (2%–4%).7-9 Seizures are the third-most-common neurological disorder in older persons, with cerebrovascular accidents being the most-common precipitant for a seizure after the age of 60. Neurodegenerative diseases are now accepted as a not-infrequent cause of seizures in older people,3 and advanced Alzheimer's disease is associated with a sixfold increased risk of unprovoked seizure, after controlling for age and gender.10 Older persons and dementia populations differ as to proportion and type of neurotransmitter declines but both are overrepresented in epilepsy epidemiology. Neuronal conduction abnormalities in the aging brain, whether associated with changes in the amount or activity of specific neurotransmitters or with reduced sensitivity to them, is thought to be associated with some of the more-prevalent emotional, behavioral, and neurological disorders of older persons. The relationship between central nervous system function and individual neurotransmitters remains only partially recognized. Less well appreciated is the interdependency of major neurotransmitter systems. Understanding of the intra- and interdependent roles within the central neurointegrative network may provide new insights into disorders of cognition in older people. As researchers gain more appreciation of the physiological and genetic mechanisms underlying seizure propagation, we may be able to develop therapeutic agents designed to suppress seizure-provoking mechanisms and to enhance the brain's natural protective mechanisms.11",

      "abstract": "The psychological states of hunger and satiety play an important role in regulating human food intake. Several lines of evidence suggest that these states rely upon declarative learning and memory processes, which are based primarily in the medial temporal lobes (MTL). The MTL, and particularly the hippocampus, is unusual in that it is especially vulnerable to insult. Consequently, we examine here the impact on hunger and satiety of conditions that: (1) are central to ingestive behaviour and where there is evidence of MTL pathology (i.e., habitual consumption of a Western-style diet, obesity, and anorexia nervosa); and (2) where there is overwhelming evidence of MTL pathology, but where ingestive behaviour is not thought central (i.e., temporal lobe epilepsy and post-traumatic stress disorder). While for some of these conditions the evidence base is currently limited, the general conclusion is that MTL impairment is linked, sometimes strongly, to dysfunctional hunger and satiety. This focus on the MTL, and declarative learning and memory processes, has implications for the development of alternative treatment approaches for the regulation of appetite.",

      "title": "A Case of Major Depressive Disorder and Symptoms of Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Responding to Escitalopram",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: Despite wide-ranging clinical use of antidepressants to treat depression alone as well as depression associated with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), there have been no reports to date on the use of serotonin reuptake inhibition with a successful outcome of both major depressive disorder (MDD) and PCOS symptomatology, such as oligomenorrhea/amenorrhea and hirsutism.\r\n\r\nCase report. Ms A, a 40-year-old married woman, had a 20-year history of recurrent MDD (DSM-IV). Her first episode began when she was 20 years old. Seven years ago, her depressive symptoms began to appear slowly, characterized by depressed mood, irritability, diminished interest in her usual activities, loss of appetite, weight loss, lack of energy, poor concentration, insomnia, and recurrent thoughts of death, such as “It would be nice not being alive.” These symptoms led to impaired work and social functioning. Her mother had a history of chronic depressive mood disorder.\r\n\r\nMs A also had a 26-year history of PCOS, characterized by oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea, hirsutism, hyperandrogenism, and polycystic ovaries, confirmed by several laboratory tests and ultrasound, meeting the 2003 Rotterdam, or European Society for Human Reproduction/American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ESHRE/ASRM), criteria.1 Twenty years ago, her gynecologist suggested lifestyle changes such as exercises, nutritional guidance, low doses of oral contraceptive pills, cosmetic therapy, and laser therapy for hirsutism. With the use of oral contraceptive pills, Ms A experienced an improvement in her menstrual cycles, although she continued to have mood swings, irritability, and severe headaches, which were extremely distressing. She was switched to several oral contraceptive pills, but all showed severe side effects. She discontinued all oral contraceptive pills after a few months of use.\r\n\r\nIn 2003, Ms A presented for treatment of MDD. Escitalopram—a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, not an oral contraceptive pill—was administered at 5 mg/d, with the dosage reaching 20 mg/d in 3 weeks. After 4 weeks of treatment, Ms A experienced clinically significant depressive symptomatic relief. Remission was achieved in 8 weeks. Over the next 18 months, she continued to receive escitalopram and experienced a return of regular menstrual cycles and improvement in hirsutism. She reported transient mild nausea at the beginning of treatment; no other side effects were reported.\r\n\r\nRemarkably, 2 months after antidepressant discontinuation, she started experiencing menstrual irregularity and hair growth. Ten months later, MDD recurred. During the next 4 years, she was on treatment with escitalopram at 20 mg/d and remained symptom-free. Meanwhile, she achieved notable menstrual cycle improvement and reduction in hirsutism. As Ms A was feeling well, she stopped taking the medication on her own and her menstrual complaints immediately recurred. She restarted escitalopram in 4 months, and her PCOS symptoms remitted again. This was the longest regular menstrual cycle period she had ever had with no use of oral contraceptive pills. Last year, her ultrasounds continued to show polycystic ovaries.\r\n\r\nReports have revealed that hyperandrogenism, hormonal disturbances, obesity, ovarian dysfunction, hypothalamic pituitary abnormalities, and insulin resistance are implicated in the etiology of PCOS.2,3 Hormonal dysregulation is involved with both MDD and PCOS. As mood disorders and PCOS share some level of genetic and pathophysiologic mechanisms,4,5 the intervention on common metabolic changes can treat both conditions.",

D'autre part, la douleur entraîne souvent un sommeil de mauvaise qualité, voire de l'insomnie. Parmi les patients souffrant de douleur chronique (p. ex. lombalgie, douleur orofaciale, fibromyalgie ou arthrite rhumatoïde), près des deux tiers rapportent que leur sommeil n'est pas suffisamment récupérateur. La relation entre la douleur et le sommeil est soit unidirectionnelle soit bidirectionnelle-circulaire. Une crise de douleur aiguë, précédant le plus souvent une plainte de mauvais sommeil, suggère une relation unidirectionnelle. Toutefois, chez les patients souffrant de douleur chronique ou intense (p. ex. post-brûlure), à une mauvaise nuit de sommeil succède une exacerbation diurne de la douleur qui, à son tour, peut diminuer la qualité du sommeil suivant et ainsi de suite. Il s'agit alors d'un trouble bidirectionnel circulaire. Des études polysomnographiques ont mis en évidence certaines caractéristiques physiologiques chez le patient souffrant de douleur chronique. La plus fréquente est l'intrusion d'ondes alphadelta électroencéphalographiques dénotant une activité corticale rapide normalement associée à l'état d'éveil. Cette intrusion, d'une durée de 20 à 40 secondes, répétée de façon périodique au cours du sommeil, reflète l'expression de micro-éveils cérébraux et du système nerveux autonome cardio-sympathique. D'autre part, des études expérimentales ont permi de caractériser les effets de la douleur sur l'architecture du sommeil. En effet, on a noté que la douleur induisait des éveils prolongés importants pendant tous les stades de sommeil (léger, profond etparadoxal) contrairement à ce que l'on pense généralement.",

The classic form, primary delusional infestation, develops without any known cause or underling illness and meets criteria for a persistent delusional disorder (ICD-10 (international classification of diseases, 10th revision)) or delusional disorder somatic type (DSM-5 ( Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , fifth edition)). Approximately 60% of patients, however, have secondary forms of delusional infestation2 that occur in the context of substance misuse (such as cocaine, amphetamines, cannabis), dopaminergic medications, antibiotics, or during physical or psychiatric illnesses (such as delirium, dementia, depression, schizophrenia, stroke, and other medical conditions that affect the brain or cause pruritus).1 2\n\nThe neurobiology of delusional infestation is not fully understood.

The purpose of this review was to discuss the evidence for psychological treatments for vomiting in pediatric FGID.Vomiting of functional origin is an increasingly recognized symptom among children and adolescents. It is highly aversive and associated with disability and poor quality of life. Cognitive behavioral therapy, lifestyle modification (especially sleep), diaphragmatic breathing, and hypnosis can be helpful in preventing vomiting episodes and reducing disability. However, no randomized clinical trials have been performed. An evidence base for psychological treatments in children with vomiting of functional origin is highly needed.Increased evidence is demonstrating value and efficacy of incorporating psychogastroenterology practices into ongoing treatment plans for digestive conditions. Current psychological treatments are focused on prevention of vomiting through stress reduction and lifestyle modification, reduction of disability by limiting avoidance behaviours, as well as counteracting biological factors. However, psychological treatments have not been shown to be helpful during an acute vomiting episode. More research is needed to build an evidence base for psychological treatments in vomiting disorders.",

FD is categorized into two subgroups based on symptoms: postprandial distress syndrome (PDS) and epigastric pain syndrome. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Summary:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; The pathophysiology of FD involves several mechanisms. Delayed gastric emptying is observed in approximately 30% of FD patients but does not correlate with symptom patterns or severity. Impaired gastric accommodation is important in the pathophysiology, particularly for PDS. Visceral hypersensitivity, characterized by heightened sensitivity to normal activities, contributes to the perception of discomfort or pain in FD. Alterations to the duodenal mucosa, including impaired mucosal barrier function and low-grade inflammation, are also implicated in the pathogenesis of FD. Microbial dysbiosis and psychological factors such as stress can further exacerbate symptoms. Treatment options include dietary modifications, establishing a physician-patient relationship, acid suppressants, prokinetics, neuromodulators, and behavioral therapies. Dietary recommendations include eating smaller, more frequent meals, and avoiding trigger foods. Acid suppressants are used as the first-line treatment. Prokinetics and neuromodulators aim to improve gastric motility and central pain processing, respectively. Behavioral therapies, including cognitive behavioral therapy and hypnotherapy, have shown benefits for refractory FD. Severe and refractory cases may require combination therapies or experimental treatments. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Key Messages:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; FD is a disorder of gut-brain interaction involving diverse pathophysiological mechanisms. Individualized treatment based on symptoms and responses to interventions is crucial. Further research is needed to improve the understanding of FD and advance the development of effective therapies.",

Dada la inespecificidad de los signos clínicos, la anamnesis y los test comportamentales han sido considerados como las principales herramientas diagnósticas para identificar este síndrome.

      "title": "Your Loved One Has Migraines",
      "abstract": "There are few things more distressing than seeing your loved one in pain. Migraine, which causes repeated attacks of severe head pain associated with other disabling symptoms, affects not only the person who has it but also impacts the people close to them. It is not just a headache. Migraine produces episodes of moderate to severe head pain that is often throbbing, and generally accompanied by sensitivity to light and noise, nausea and/or vomiting, and is worsened with movement or routine activity. There may be other symptoms, such as sensitivity to odors, inability to concentrate, trouble producing speech, numbness, balance problems, weakness, double vision, and dizziness. About 25% of patients with migraine experience an aura of visual symptoms or other neurologic symptoms, usually occurring prior to their headache pain. The headaches usually last several hours and sometimes persist for days. Some patients identify triggers, such as food triggers, alcohol, food additives, certain odors, and artificial sweeteners. Patients with migraine have a genetic predisposition to having migraines, and most have a family history of migraine. The migraine brain is “sensitive” and reacts to things that do not generally bother people who do not have migraine. The migraine brain also hates change. Thus, stress or let-down from stress, change in sleep pattern (too much, too little, changing sleep onset or awakening time), heat, bright lights, loud noises, missing meals, and dehydration may provoke migraines as well. Migraines often occur with menstrual periods in women and worsen around menopause when hormones are fluctuating. Weather changes are often blamed but the scientific data supporting this are inconsistent. The most common reason that migraines worsen over time is overuse of symptomatic medications, which is called medication overuse headache. Over-the-counter as well as prescription medications can produce this condition, which turns episodic migraine into headaches that become more frequent and ultimately become daily. Even seemingly “safe” medications such as acetaminophen, anti-inflammatory medications and caffeine-containing compounds can cause worsening of migraines over time. It is important to limit symptomatic medication use (all medications combined if there is more than one medication used) to twice weekly. If someone requires symptomatic more often than twice a week, their preventive medication is not optimized. Stressful life events and chronic internalized stress are other common causes of worsening migraine. The medical profession used to talk about a “migraine personality” occurring in type A, driven, controlling, detail-oriented people. This is not true; anyone can have migraine. As migraine is episodic, often severe, and interferes with activities, many people with migraine have anxiety related to the fear of future migraines. Having frequent pain and feeling like a burden to one's family also leads to depression. Sometimes the loved ones wonder if patients with migraine are using their headaches to be manipulative missing school, not attending events, requiring help for daily tasks. This is generally not the case but some people with frequent headaches (particularly those overusing symptomatic medications) develop pain behaviors and assume a “sick role.” Well-meaning relatives and friends may sometimes worsen this, catering to all the needs of their loved one and focusing the majority of interactions on their pain. This is draining on loved ones as well as patients and may create a downward spiral of deteriorating relationships and social withdrawal. Patients with migraine do not require 24 hour care or observation (even in the hospital). It is important for people with severe migraines to keep living life, getting out of bed and doing something every day, and emphasizing what they CAN do, rather than what they CANNOT do every day. Exercise helps, and need not be vigorous walking, light yoga, tai chi, pilates, and water exercise are all good options. Patients are encouraged to pursue hobbies and interests, even if they don't feel well. Children should go to school. Cognitive behavioral therapy, stress management, mindfulness meditation, and biofeedback are helpful. Anxiety is best addressed by these methods combined with counseling, as opposed to medications. Counseling and antidepressants are helpful to treat depression; while patients with depression are more likely to have migraine and vice versa, improvement of pain often helps mood. Each patient needs to take charge of their own care, including managing (and knowing) their own medications, speaking for themselves at office visits, sending and responding to their own medical office communications, and contacting the office themselves (unless the circumstances are dire). That said, others may want to be on the lookout for medication overuse, hiding or hoarding medications. Migraine is inherently a treatable problem. Successful treatment of frequent migraines requires more than pills and procedures, although they help substantially. Other aspects of care include physical therapy, exercise, counseling and mental health care, and focusing on a healthy lifestyle and happy living. Realistic expectations are important: we are aiming for a reduction in migraine frequency, with infrequent migraines that are effectively treated with symptomatic medications when they occur.",

      "abstract": "Hepatic encephalopathy is one of the most frequent terminal episodes of primary liver disease. It was already known at the time of Hippocrates, and it was well described by Johanne Baptista Margagni, teacher at the Padua Medical School, in the 18th century. Hepatic encephalopathy is a neuropsychiatric syndrome seen in the pres­ ence of hepatic functional impairment secondary to acute liver failure or chronic parenchymal liver disease with or without spontaneous or surgi­ cally induced portalsystemic shunting of portal blood. The neuropsychiatric symptoms of liver failure are varied and range from subtle alterations, including mild personality change and disturbance in sleep rhythm, to confusion, drowsiness, stupor, and finally deep coma. In acute liver failure the progression of events may be extremely rapid, taking place in only a few hours. In chronic encephalopathy, in contrast, consciousness may be slowly altered over months, and may occasionally present as progressive and irre­ versible neurological symptomatology with dementia, parkinsonism, or other extrapyramidal signs suggesting involvement of the cerebellum or basal ganglia (170). Most often in the chronic situation, however, episodes of mental impairment are episodic, the result of defined stresses, and recov­ ery to the premorbid state is the rule. Other symptoms of hepatic encephalopathy are not specific for liver disease. Asterixis (flapping tremor of the extremities) is probably the most characteristic neurological sign of hepatic encephalopathy, is more common",

The adaptive changes that occur are coordinated and mediated by the stress system in the central nervous system (which includes corticotrophin-releasing hormone and noradrenergic neurons in the hypothalamus and brainstem, respectively), and its peripheral limbs, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the autonomic (sympathetic) system. Controlled or self-driven challenges to homeostasis and a normally functioning stress system are crucial for normal development and preservation of self and species. In childhood and adolescence, appropriately functioning neuroendocrine responses to stressors are necessary to allow growth and psychosexual maturation to progress normally. Maladaptive neuroendocrine responses, i.e. dysregulation of the stress system, may lead to disturbances in growth and development and cause psychiatric, endocrine/metabolic and/or autoimmune diseases or vulnerability to such diseases, not only during childhood and adolescence, but also in adulthood.",

      "abstract": "La prise en charge des défaillances vitales est une urgence ; elle ne doit pas être retardée par la réalisation d'examens complémentaires ni par un traitement évacuateur et/ou épurateur. Les troubles neurologiques sont très fréquents au cours des intoxications par médicaments ou produits illicites (coma, encéphalopathies, convulsions, mouvements anormaux). Il n'existe pas de corrélation entre leur intensité et la sévérité de l'intoxication. La gravité immédiate d'un coma d'origine toxique est liée à sa profondeur. Mais la gravité potentielle et donc le pronostic final dépendent du mécanisme de toxicité et des complications associées. Le traitement symptomatique des manifestations neurologiques est une urgence et une prise en charge médicalisée précoce des patients inconscients est recommandée. Les complications respiratoires dues à l'altération de la conscience (dépression respiratoire centrale, obstruction mécanique des voies aériennes supérieures, pneumopathie d'inhalation, SDRA) sont fréquentes au cours des intoxications médicamenteuses et peuvent altérer le pronostic d'intoxications a priori bénignes. La prise en charge des complications respiratoires comporte peu d'éléments spécifiques à l'étiologie toxique et peut aller de l'observation simple aux techniques de ventilation, voire d'échanges gazeux extracorporels, les plus sophistiquées, sans que l'intérêt de ces dernières ait été validé en toxicologie. Les complications cardiovasculaires peuvent survenir de façon extrêmement précoce, ce qui justifie un transport médicalisé vers l'hôpital de tout patient intoxiqué, même chez un patient asymptomatique. Les formes à libération prolongée sont responsables d'une symptomatologie retardée et prolongée. Les mécanismes de toxicité sont souvent intriqués. La connaissance du ou des mécanismes impliqués dans un état de choc d'origine toxique est primordiale pour un traitement adapté. Il existe des spécificités de traitement des collapsus toxiques (sels molaires de bicarbonate de sodium, sels de calcium, glucagon à forte dose, insuline euglycémique) et l'indication d'une assistance circulatoire devant une intoxication par stabilisant de membrane réfractaire au traitement médical doit être discutée avant que ne survienne une défaillance multiviscérale irréversible. Les hépatites toxiques médicamenteuses sont globalement responsables de 20 % des hépatites fulminantes. En cas d'hépatite fulminante, le transfert vers un centre de transplantation doit être précoce. Management of drug-induced organ failure is a medical emergency that should not be delayed by any additional examination or attempt at decontamination. Drug-induced neurological disturbances are very frequent in acute poisonings (coma, encephalopathy, seizures, and abnormal movements). There is no correlation between their magnitude and the severity of the poisoning. The immediate severity is related to the depth of drug-induced coma. However, the outcome depends on the mechanism of toxicity as well as the occurrence of complications. Supportive treatment of neurological manifestations is a medical emergency and the early medical management of unconscious patients should be recommended. Drug-induced respiratory distress (including central respiratory depression, obstruction of the airways, aspiration pneumonia, and ARDS) is frequent in drug-induced poisoning and may alter the final outcome of non-life-threatening poisonings. Supportive treatment of drug-induced respiratory distress is rather non-specific including medical observation, mechanical ventilation, and even sophisticated methods like extracorporeal removal of CO2 whose efficiency in drug-induced poisoning remains to be determined. Drug-induced cardiovascular disturbances may occur early and abruptly. Thus, the transfer of all patients poisoned with cardiotropic drugs requires medical supervision, even in asymptomatic patients. Sustained release drugs may cause a delay in onset of sustained toxic effects. The mechanisms of toxicity are frequently associated. The precise knowledge of the different mechanisms involved in a drug-induced cardiovascular shock is mandatory for providing adequate supportive treatment. There is some specificity regarding the treatment of drug-induced cardiovascular shock including the administration of molar sodium bicarbonate, calcium salts, high-dose of glucagon, and insulin. The indication of extracorporeal life-support should be considered in case of poisonings involving membrane-stabilizing agent, refractory to conventional treatment, before the onset of irreversible multiorgan failure. Drug-induced hepatitis globally accounts for 20% of fulminant hepatitis. Fulminant hepatitis requires considering the early transfer in center specialized in liver transplantation.",

Although patients may present with dysphagia as an issue that requires palliation, other patients may develop dysphagia as a complication of progressive disease and increasing debilitation. The diagnosis of dyspepsia requires patients to be experiencing one or more of the following four problems: epigastric pain, epigastric burning, postprandial fullness, or early satiety. Dyspepsia may occur either as a functional disorder where the cause is not clear or as a secondary disorder. Hiccup, or more correctly, singultus, is a problem where patients experience a sharp and involuntary contraction of the muscles of inspiration which cause a sudden sharp inspiration and closure of the glottis. For most, this is a short-lived experience. This chapter discusses the definition, prevalence, pathophysiology, causes, presenting problems, investigations, and management of dysphagia, dyspepsia, and hiccups.",

      "title": "Posterior pelvic floor compartment disorders",
      "abstract": "Posterior pelvic floor compartment disorders generally refer to functional anorectal disturbances that by definition are symptom-based rather than anatomical defect-based and have a significant impact on quality of life. Symptoms attributed to the posterior compartment are often non-specific and associated with structural, neuromuscular and functional defects giving rise to symptoms of prolapse, pelvic pressure, faecal incontinence, stool trapping and constipation. They may range from mild to incapacitating and occur in varying combinations. While symptoms of constipation and incontinence may conceptually represent the opposing extremes of normal anorectal function, the dynamic interrelationships between the different pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the development of these disorders suggest a more complex explanation. Faecal continence and defecation are dependent on several neurological and anatomical factors that involve coordinated physiological processes, including intestinal transit and absorption, colonic transit, rectal compliance, anorectal sensation and continence mechanism. However, it is well recognized that pelvic floor symptoms originating from one compartment do not imply absent pathology in another compartment. Furthermore, symptoms associated with one disorder (such as constipation related to functional obstructed defecation) can be causative in the sequential development of other pelvic floor disorders, such as a urogenital prolapse syndrome, that may further exacerbate symptoms. In addition, it has been found that treatment that corrects one problem may improve, worsen or even predispose to other symptoms from another compartment. Consequently, while the concept of global pelvic floor dysfunction has emerged, the traditional single speciality referral and evaluation of pelvic floor problems continues to foster potentially segregated management strategies that can overlook the relevance of concomitant symptomatology. The evaluation and treatment of posterior pelvic compartment disorders needs to assume an individualized but multidisciplinary therapeutic approach. Given the variation in surgical approaches described to correct anatomical integrity of posterior pelvic compartment deficits, the consensus on optimal management has yet to be achieved. Therefore, it is critical that outcome measures following surgery are clearly defined. Treatment is to a great extent dictated to by functional severity and the impact that symptoms have on quality of life. Long-term follow-up should ensure that the potential for complications is minimized and satisfactory bowel, bladder and sexual function is maintained.",

      "title": "Familial Hemiplegic Migraine",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) falls within the category of migraine with aura. In migraine with aura (including FHM) the neurologic symptoms of aura are unequivocally localizable to the cerebral cortex or brain stem and include visual disturbance (most common), sensory loss (e.g., numbness or paresthesias of the face or an extremity), and dysphasia (difficulty with speech). FHM must include motor involvement, such as hemiparesis (weakness of an extremity). Hemiparesis occurs with at least one other symptom during FHM aura. Neurologic deficits with FHM attacks can be prolonged for hours to days and may outlast the associated migrainous headache. FHM is often earlier in onset than typical migraine, frequently beginning in the first or second decade; the frequency of attacks tends to decrease with age. Approximately 40%-50% of families with CACNA1A-FHM have cerebellar signs ranging from nystagmus to progressive, usually late-onset mild ataxia. Diagnosis/testing The clinical diagnosis of FHM can be established in a proband: (1) who fulfills criteria for migraine with aura; (2) in whom the aura includes fully reversible motor weakness and visual, sensory, or language symptoms; and (3) who has at least one first- or second-degree relative with similar attacks that fulfill the diagnostic criteria for hemiplegic migraine. The molecular diagnosis can be established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in ATP1A2, CACNA1A, or SCN1A. Management Treatment of manifestations: A trial of acetazolamide for individuals with CACNA1A-FHM or a trial of prophylactic migraine medications (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, antiepileptic medications) for all FHM types may be warranted for frequent attacks. Antiepileptic treatment may be necessary for seizures, which are prevalent in ATP1A2-FHM. Surveillance: Neurologic evaluation to assess change in attack frequency and/or seizures, annually or more frequently for worsening symptoms. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Vasoconstricting agents because of the risk of stroke; cerebral angiography as it may precipitate a severe attack. Genetic counseling FHM and simplex hemiplegic migraine caused by a heterozygous ATP1A2, CACNA1A, or SCN1A pathogenic variant are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Because the diagnosis of FHM requires at least one affected first-degree relative, most individuals diagnosed with FHM have an affected parent. Individuals with simplex hemiplegic migraine (i.e., individuals with an FHM-causing pathogenic variant and an apparently negative family history) may have a de novo pathogenic variant or a pathogenic variant inherited from an asymptomatic parent. Each child of an individual with FHM has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. Once an FHM-causing pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

      "abstract": "A 47-year-old man with a long history of alcohol dependence and impaired control over intake has refused all the approaches suggested to him (e.g., detoxification followed by residential treatment, Alcoholics Anonymous, cognitive–behavioural therapy). He maintains a reasonable psychosocial adjustment (i.e., family relations, work, leisure), and physical damage (neurological, cardiovascular, liver functions) is still minimal. What can his family physician offer him?\r\n\r\nAmong the emotional and psychological problems treated by primary care physicians, alcoholism is one of the most frequent. However, little of the accumulated knowledge in alcoholism research over the past 20 years has percolated to clinical practice. Psychopharmacological agents in alcohol abuse treatment are largely ignored. At least 3 reasons are easy to identify:\r\n\r\n· Alcohol dependence, when not too severe, is not perceived as an addiction and is not put on the same footing as addictions to illicit substances.\r\n\r\n· Craving for alcohol is not linked with the long-term alterations in neuronal activity of neurotransmitter systems that alcohol abuse induces.\r\n\r\n· Their effects on treatment retention and drinking outcomes are significant but modest. The placebo groups in the clinical trials show usually so much improvement (Malec E, et al. Buspirone in the treatment of alcohol dependence: a placebo-controlled trial. Alcohol Clin Exp Res 1996;20:307-12; Kranzler HR. Pharmacotherapy of alcoholism: gaps in knowledge and opportunities for research. Alcohol Alcohol 2000;35:537-47) that large samples are necessary to demonstrate the superiority of the active medication. What does it mean? That the most important factor in the control group resides in the patient motivation (belief, expectation, readiness to change) and in the therapist's skill in enhancing motivation.\r\n\r\nThe good news concerning the psychotherapeutic approach in alcoholism is that current evidence shows that a brief intervention, easy to learn by nonspecialists, is among the most efficacious and not inferior to more intensive and more costly approaches. Severe cases, as well as less severe ones, can be handled in that way (Miller WR, Rollnick S. Motivational interviewing. 2nd ed. New York: Guilford Press; 2002). Treatment consists of detailed assessment, feedback, an empathic and nonconfrontational approach and systematic resolution of ambivalence.\r\n\r\nAmong the pharmacological adjuvants that can facilitate such brief interventions are opioid antagonists (naltrexone [50 mg/d], approved by the US FDA in 1994, and acamprosate [1.3–2 g/d], in use in Europe for 14 years and currently under review by the FDA). They interfere with the brain neurotransmitter systems that produce the rewarding effects of alcohol and have been shown to contribute significantly to prolong abstinence. Craving scores fall significantly within a few weeks. These antidipsotropic medications are low risk. Lengths of trials have extended to 1 year or more. Reported side effects for naltrexone are nausea, headaches, dizziness and arthralgia; renal insufficiency is the only known contraindication of acamprosate.\r\n\r\nOther psychopharmacological agents, such as buspirone or bromocriptine, contribute to the improvement of alcohol-induced psychopathology (anxiety, depression, aggressiveness), but have no demonstrated effect on craving and relapse prevention.\r\n\r\nThe family physician's current best choice is to learn the motivational interviewing principles and techniques, combined or not with anticraving medication.",

Many women suffer, to some degree, the cyclic signs of PMS-irritability, depression, anxiety, impaired concentration, breast swelling and tenderness, headache, binge eating and/or craving for sweet or salty foods. But why? Is the cause hormonal and/or biochemical imbalance, poor nutrition, underlying psychiatric disorder, or some other unknown factor(1-3)? syndrome is defined as a complex of symptoms-somatic, behavioral, and emotional-occurring in the luteal phase. This phase usually begins in midcycle with ovulation, when the follicle is changed into corpus luteum, and ends at (or shortly after) menstruation(l). In many ways, PMS mimics dysmenorrhea; the key differences are in the timing of symptoms and in pelvic cramping. Although headache, nausea, edema, and fatigue are common to both, pelvic cramping is specific to, and the principal sign of, dysmenorrhea, which generally begins a day or two before menses and peaks in severity on the first or second day of flow. PMS has a wider variety of symptoms (150 having been identified in the literature)(4). syndrome also begins earlier in the cycle than does dysmenorrhea, and PMS is abruptly relieved at menses. An estimated 20 to 40 percent of women of childbearing age suffer some premenstrual symptoms. However, it is also believed that only 5 to 15 percent have very severe symptoms(5). Many theories have been proposed on specific etiology. An estrogen/progesterone imbalance, excessive prostaglandins, abnormal magnesium metabolism, vitamin deficiencies, reactive hypoglycemia, and neuroendocrine changes in the hypothalmic-pituitary axis are among them, but no theory has been conclusively proved(1-8). Theories on effective treatment also abound. AJN asked nurses, physicians, and researchers involved in the treatment and study of PMS what methods they used, and to what effect. It became clear that nurses are playing the key role in the management of patients with PMS, and that they can back up their advice on methods with solid evidence. Michelle Harrison, of Cambridge, Massachusetts, author of Self-Help for Premenstrual Syndrome, advises physicians that nurses are ideally qualified to handle patients with PMS(9). Guy E. Abraham, a California PMS specialist known for significant research on nutritional and vitamin treatment for the disorder, agrees: The in PMS treatment is that the patient has most of her contact with a nurse. Total nurse management is not unusual, unless a medical evaluation is necessary to rule out possible disease. predominant model might describe Mary Ann Wilson, RN, C, a nurse practitioner who has seen over 100 PMS patients in the obstetrics and gynecology department of the Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, a health maintenance organization (HMO) in East Hartford, Connecticut. department is staffed by five nurse practitioners, four physicians, and two RNs who do phone follow-up. Wilson says PMS patients are referred to the nurse practitioners. We do all the screening and counseling, unless a medical problem is indicated, or the patient requests an MD, she reports. initial PMS consult is scheduled during the patient's asymptomatic follicular phase (which runs from menses to ovulation), Wilson explained, since a PMS patient is then under less stress and she'll have much more energy to do what you suggest. Some women, says Wilson, will first call during an emergency. We'll do a 'validating' visit; we will talk and calm them and advise a visit when they don't feel so bad. If the patient seems in crisis, particularly if she is suicidal, we will send her immediately to the mental health department for counseling. Most HMO patients have had a thorough physical within six to 12 months of seeking help for PMS. nurse reviews the patient's chart for health problems that could be contributing to, or confused with, PMS. A nutritional history is taken, with particular attention to excessive alcohol, salt, and caffeine intake.

In some cases, they can result in sleep disruption and injuries, with adverse health or psychosocial consequences for patients, bed-partners or both. According to the International Classification of Sleep Disorders, parasomnias are distinguished on the basis of the stage of sleep in which they appear: (1) parasomnias arising from NREM (non-rapid eye movement) sleep, which include arousal disorders (confusional arousal, sleep terror, sleepwalking) and sleep-related eating disorders; (2) parasomnias associated with REM (rapid eye movement) sleep; and (3) “other parasomnias” occurring in any sleep stage (eg, sleep enuresis, exploding head syndrome).

      "abstract": "A dysmorphism is difference in a body structure. If the dysmorphia is truly the only abnormality that you see in the child, further evaluation is often unnecessary. Isolated dysmorphisms are typically caused by malformation (abnormal tissue development), deformation (distortion caused by a mechanic force), disruption (destruction of a normal forming structure), or dysplasia (anomaly of growth and differentiation). A patient with multiple dysmorphisms, however, typically requires further workup to arrive at the cause, which could be chromosomal, genetic, or environmental such as in utero exposure to teratogen or infection. 1 Making the diagnosis relies on recognizing the pattern of dysmorphisms. The 4 major patterns to consider are the following 2 : Association: Physical features that often occur together more often than would be seen by chance alone, but no single etiology is yet known to explain the pattern. Vertebral anomalies, anal atresia, cardiac defects, trachea esophageal fistula, renal anomalies, and limb anomalies (VACTERL) are examples of associations with no unifying etiology. Sequence: A group of defects that stem from a sequential set of events that began with one malformation. An example is Potter sequence with renal agenesis resulting in no fetal urine production, which leads to severe oligohydramnios with the consequences of lung hypoplasia and intrauterine constraint that cause limb deformities and compressed facial features. Syndrome: A cluster of anomalies that occur in a consistent pattern that has a unifying cause, known or unknown. Developmental field defect: A group of malformations caused by harm to a particular region of the embryo. An example is hemifacial microsomia, unilateral facial hypoplasia, and ear anomalies that come from anomalous development of the first and second brachial arch structures.",

      "abstract": "Abstract There are numerous reasons why stopping antidepressants might be prudent, including harms (for example, emotional numbing, sexual issues, and other physical health consequences) outweighing benefits, use beyond guideline recommendations, and patient preference. Withdrawal effects arise due to adaptation to chronic use of antidepressants – often termed physical dependence, distinct from addiction. Withdrawal effects can manifest as either physical or psychological symptoms and can often be mistaken for a return of an underlying condition or onset of a new physical or mental health condition. The most severe withdrawal effects are suicidality, akathisia and protracted withdrawal syndromes which can last for months or years and can sometimes be debilitating. Careful tapering can minimise these effects. After long‐term use tapering should be gradual (months or years), and adjusted to a rate that the individual can tolerate. Dose reduction should be conducted in a hyperbolic pattern (so that decrements become smaller and smaller as the total dose gets lower) to reflect the hyperbolic relationship between dose and receptor occupancy. In order to facilitate gradual hyperbolic tapering formulations other than widely available tablets will be required, including liquid versions, compounded versions or off‐label use of existing formulations. Switching from one antidepressant to fluoxetine can be problematic. Every‐other‐day dosing for antidepressants other than fluoxetine is likely to lead to withdrawal effects.",

      "abstract": "Endocrine Consequences of Anorexia Nervosa Abstract. Anorexia nervosa is a perilous disease of unknown etiology that causes a variety of endocrine effects. Characteristic for anorexia nervosa are a reduced food intake and thus significant underweight, as well as the fear of gaining weight. Often sufferers also have a distorted self-perception, the urge to move and amenorrhea. AN is difficult to treat and often has a chronic course, and is associated with an increased mortality risk. The endocrinological changes occur in several endocrine axes, their extent is related to the degree of malnutrition. Low leptin levels, due to the underweight, signal a potentially dangerous lack of energy to the brain. There is a cascade of neuroendocrine adaptive responses to help the organism to survive. The effects of starvation are extensive, affecting the pituitary gland, thyroid gland, as well as the adrenal glands, gonads and bones. In positive cases, most dysfunctions are reversible; the compromised bone stability recovers only slowly.Zusammenfassung. Anorexia nervosa ist eine gefährliche Krankheit mit noch unbekannter Ätiologie, die eine Vielzahl von endokrinen Auswirkungen verursacht. Charakteristisch für Anorexia nervosa sind eine reduzierte Nahrungsaufnahme und dadurch deutliches Untergewicht, sowie die Angst vor Gewichtszunahme. Oft haben Betroffene auch eine verzerrte Selbstwahrnehmung, Bewegungsdrang und eine ausbleibende Regelblutung. Anorexia nervosa ist schwierig zu behandeln, hat einen oft chronischen Verlauf und ist mit einem erhöhten Mortalitätsrisiko verbunden. Die endokrinologischen Veränderungen treten in mehreren endokrinen Achsen auf, ihr Ausmass hängt mit dem Grad der Unterernährung zusammen. Ein niedriger Leptin-Serumspiegel, bedingt durch das Untergewicht, signalisiert dem Gehirn einen potenziell gefährlichen Energiemangel. Es kommt zu einer Kaskade von neuroendokrinen Anpassungsreaktionen, um dem Organismus das Überleben zu sichern. Die Auswirkungen des Hungerzustandes sind weitreichend und beeinträchtigen Hypophyse, Schilddrüse, Nebennieren, Gonaden und Knochen. Bei positiven Verläufen sind die meisten Dysfunktionen reversibel; die kompromittierte Knochenstabilität kann sich nur zögerlich erholen.",

      "abstract": "Los problemas para dormir son comunes en los niños con y sin trastornos del espectro autista o TEA (ASD, por sus siglas en inglés). Entre la mitad y un tercio de los niños con TEA tienen problemas para dormir. Esto puede causar problemas durante el día, como falta de atención, irritabilidad o exhibición de más comportamientos repetitivos. La cantidad de horas de sueño durante la noche que necesitan los niños en edad preescolar, en general, es de 10 a 13 horas. A medida que crecen, el tiempo se reduce. Para los 13 años, la cantidad habitual de sueño necesaria es de entre 8 y 11 horas. Los problemas para dormir pueden afectar también a los padres y cuidadores, además del niño, porque los padres pierden horas de sueño al estar atendiendo a un niño que está despierto.Los niños con TEA pueden tener muchos motivos para no dormir. Las causas pueden ser médicas, de comportamiento o ambas. Las causas médicas de los problemas para dormir pueden incluir alergias, problemas para respirar y reflujo gastroesofágico (molestias estomacales).Los medicamentos también pueden afectar el sueño. Los motivos de comportamiento que causan problemas para dormir pueden ser cambios en las rutinas diarias o de la hora de acostarse, estrés en casa o en la escuela, cambio de cuidadores o cualquier otra cosa que rompa el patrón habitual de su hijo.El sueño tiene ciclos con distintos patrones de ondas cerebrales. Estos patrones pueden ser distintos en algunas personas con TEA. Es posible que las personas con TEA tengan el sueño más liviano y sueñen menos más tarde en la noche. Ese es el momento en que frecuentemente ocurre el despertar durante la noche. La hormona llamada melatonina es producida por el cerebro para controlar el sueño. Algunos estudios científicos muestran que las personas con TEA posiblemente no tengan la misma cantidad o actividad de melatonina.Algunos problemas para dormir incluyen:El médico de su hijo puede realizarle un examen físico general y obtener los antecedentes de problemas de salud y para dormir. Trate de llevar un diario del sueño durante un tiempo para ayudar al médico del niño a comprender los hábitos de sueño de su hijo. Informe al médico del niño si su hijo ronca fuerte o si tiene problemas de respiración por la noche y cualquier otra afección de salud que pudiera tener su hijo. El pediatra del niño podría pedirle pruebas si la historia clínica o el resultado del examen físico sugirieran que hay motivos médicos que causan los problemas de sueño.Los estudios han demostrado que las estrategias de comportamiento ayudan más que los medicamentos a mejorar los problemas para dormir. Estos son algunos pasos que pueden ayudar:En ocasiones, el solo hecho de crear buenos hábitos de sueño ayuda con los problemas para dormir, pero tal vez se necesiten otras medidas.Muchos niños con TEA responden a las órdenes y a las recompensas al intentar cambiar sus comportamientos. Repase junto a su hijo lo que espera que haga, con anticipación y nuevamente cada noche. Piense en la posibilidad de usar una tabla de imágenes o una historia para describir la rutina de la hora de acostarse. Si su hijo se ha quedado en la cama, ofrézcale una recompensa por la mañana, como un dulce que le guste, un juego o un ratito para usar pantallas.Si los problemas para dormir continúan después de establecer un buen lugar para que su hija duerma y una rutina para dormir adecuadas, tal vez desee agregar el paso de ignorarla cuando lo llame desde su cama. Cuando deje a su hija en la habitación, diga “buenas noches” y felicítela por irse a la cama. Luego vaya a controlarla en los momentos en que usted haya decidido hacerlo (generalmente cada pocos minutos) e ignórela entre los controles. Extienda el tiempo entre los controles durante la noche y en el transcurso de los días siguientes. Cuando vaya a controlar, échele un vistazo a la habitación. Si su hija está despierta, dígale que se duerma y luego váyase. No hay problema si su hija se duerme en el piso.Es muy importante que todos los cuidadores respeten este paso; hable con el resto de su familia sobre este plan antes de implementarlo. Si vive en un apartamento o condominio, tal vez también quiera hablar con sus vecinos. Los llantos y berrinches de su hija empeorarán durante varios días, pero con el tiempo mejorarán. Es fundamental que respete su plan y lo lleve adelante de la misma manera durante al menos 2 semanas, de principio a fin, para poder notar una diferencia. Tal vez necesite ayuda adicional para hacer esto, ya que puede ser difícil y agotador para padres y cuidadores.Algunos niños con TEA necesitan atención permanente para mantenerlos a salvo debido a sus comportamientos. Si su hija corre riesgo de lastimarse cuando no la esté supervisando y suele despertarse mucho durante la noche, pruebe las siguientes medidas de seguridad:El pediatra de su hija puede sugerir el uso de medicamentos recetados o de venta libre junto con el entrenamiento del comportamiento. Debe hablar con el médico de su hija antes de probar cualquier medicamento o suplemento herbal para su hija.Si aplicó este consejo todos los días durante 2 semanas y su hija sigue teniendo problemas para dormir, debe hablar con el pediatra de la niña. Hay otras intervenciones del comportamiento que se pueden usar.Los problemas muy difíciles deberán ser consultados con un experto en el sueño.La información incluida en este recurso no debería reemplazar la atención médica ni el consejo de su pediatra. Puede que haya variaciones en el tratamiento que le recomiende su pediatra basándose en los hechos y circunstancias individuales.

      "abstract": "Dyspepsia is a symptom consisting of postprandial distress, early satiation, or epigastric pain or discomfort. It is described by patients using a variety of terms, including \"indigestion\". The etiology is suspected by the clinician to arise from the upper gastrointestinal (GI) tract, but other etiologies must also be considered. Most patients with these symptoms have functional dyspepsia (FD). The most common organic etiologies include peptic ulcer, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), and medication side effect. In patients less than 55 years of age who have no alarm features, the most cost-effective approach is an initial test-and-treat strategy for H. pylori, followed by empiric proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy and, ultimately, esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD), if symptoms persist. FD commonly overlaps with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and GERD, suggesting shared pathogenic factors. Metoclopramide should usually be avoided because of its side effects, especially in the elderly. Domperidone helps some patients but is not Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved.",

Continence depends on a number of factors including cognitive function, stool volume and stool consistency, colonic transit, rectal compliance, anal sphincter function, anorectal sensation, and anorectal reflexes. Loss of continence often results from impairment in any of these factors. Initial evaluation consists of a focused history and a physical examination looking for potential reversible and/or treatable factors. First-line treatment include dietary, behavioral, and pharmacologic management approaches in community-dwelling and long-term care settings. If first-line treatments are not effective, additional evaluation with anorectal manometry and other tests may be warranted. Surgical treatments for FI may improve symptoms and more efficacy data is needed, especially among older adults. Therapeutic options using behavioral, pharmacological, and surgical approaches can lead to symptomatic improvements or cure for FI and increased quality of life for the older patient.",

      "title": "The role of depression in coronary artery disease",
      "abstract": "The concept of depression encompasses a series of psychopathological disorders that differ in regard to symptomatology, severity, course and prognosis. It is important to individualize these disorders for a better understanding of the following studies and of their diagnostic management. Major depressive disorder, as defined by CID X 1 and DSM IV , may have different clinical characteristics (table I). A specifier that may be employed in diagnosing the major depressive episode is the presence of melancholic symptoms (melancholia), whose main characteristic is the loss of interest and pleasure in all or almost all activities and a lack of reactivity to usually pleasant stimuli. In these circumstances, the depressive mood does not improve, not even temporarily, when something positive happens. Yet, at least three of the following symptoms should be present for the diagnosis of major depression to be made: depressive mood qualitatively different from the normal, worsening in the morning, terminal insomnia (to wake up at least two hours before the usual time), psychomotor retardation or agitation, anorexia or significant weight loss (5% of the body weight per month), excessive or inappropriate guilt. Sometimes, however, the depressive disorder is atypical with mood reactivity, i.e., enhancement of the mood in response to real or potential positive events, significant weight gain, increase in appetite, hypersomnia, sensation of heaviness in the upper and lower limbs, in addition to a prolonged pattern of sensitivity to interpersonal rejection resulting in significant social or occupational impairment . The dysthymic disorder (dysthymia) is characterized by a chronically depressed mood lasting for most of the day, for the majority of days, and lasting for at least two years . The individual may note significant reduction in usual interests and in self-criticism, frequently seeing himself or herself as uninteresting and incapable. As these symptoms become part of daily life, usually they are not mentioned by the patient unless directly inquired about by Andre Luiz Langer Manica, Carolina Garcia Soares Leaes, Benicio Noronha Frey, Mario Francisco Juruena",

      "title": "Attachment and mentalization in anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa",
      "abstract": "Gehechtheid en mentaliseren bij anorexia nervosa en bulimia nervosa. De voornaamste conclusie van dit onderzoek is dat voor duurzaam herstel van anorexia nervosa (AN) en bulimia nervosa (BN) naast verandering van eetgedrag een beter begrip van zichzelf en een grotere autonomie in relatie tot anderen belangrijk zijn. AN en BN zijn aandoeningen die zich kenmerken door afwijkend eetgedrag en een onevenredig grote invloed van het gewicht op de zelfwaardering. Vrijwel altijd spelen er negatieve gevoelens over zichzelf en over het contact met anderen. Ook is er naast de eetstoornis vaak sprake van andere psychische problemen zoals depressiviteit, angst, persoonlijkheidsproblematiek, autisme of ADHD. Ondanks behandeling herstelt een aanzienlijk deel van de patienten niet. De vertaling van negatieve gevoelens in een obsessie met eten en gewicht, die zo kenmerkend is voor AN en BN, zou kunnen samenhangen met onveilige gehechtheid en een beperkt vermogen tot mentaliseren. Een onveilige gehechtheidsstijl kenmerkt zich door moeite om emotionele gebeurtenissen te hanteren. Goed mentaliseren houdt in dat je je een redelijk correcte voorstelling kunt maken van wat er in jezelf en anderen omgaat. Een beperkt mentaliserend vermogen zou mee kunnen spelen in de sociale moeilijkheden die patienten met AN en BN ervaren en hun neiging zich op uiterlijk en gewicht te richten. Bij patienten met een borderline persoonlijkheidsstoornis bleken onveilige gehechtheid en beperkt mentaliserend vermogen door psychotherapie te kunnen verbeteren. Mijn onderzoek had als doel om meer zicht te krijgen op de rol van gehechtheid en mentaliseren in het beloop van AN en BN, en zo mogelijk bij te dragen aan verbetering van de behandeling. Daartoe werden 50 patienten gevolgd die in psychotherapeutische behandeling gingen in een specialistisch behandelcentrum voor eetstoornissen, tot 1 jaar en 1,5 jaar later. Eerst werden ze vergeleken met gezonde controlepersonen. Vragen betroffen: 1. verschillen tussen patienten en gezonde personen qua gehechtheid en mentaliseren, en de relatie van gehechtheid en mentaliseren met symptomen; 2. veranderingen qua gehechtheid en mentaliseren in 1 jaar van behandeling, en de samenhang van deze veranderingen met vermindering van symptomen. Naast de eetstoornis werd ook gekeken naar bijkomende psychische problematiek. Uitkomsten waren dat patienten vaker een onveilige gehechtheidsstijl hadden en minder goed konden mentaliseren dan de gezonde controlepersonen, zonder dat dit verband hield met de ernst van hun eetstoornis. Wel was er verband met het voorkomen van zelfverwondend gedrag en van een borderline persoonlijkheidsstoornis. Een jaar later deden 38 patienten opnieuw mee aan het onderzoek. Eetstoornis, depressie, angst, persoonlijkheidsproblematiek en gehechtheid waren verbeterd; mentaliseren, autonomie en zelfverwonding niet. 28% was na 1 jaar geheel hersteld van de eetstoornis. Herstel – ook bij 1,5 jaar follow-up - hing samen met een groter mentaliserend vermogen. De herstelde patienten waren in 1 jaar tijd in vergelijking tot hen die niet waren hersteld autonomer geworden: minder gevoelig voor anderen en beter in staat met nieuwe situaties om te gaan. Conclusies uit mijn onderzoek zijn dat gehechtheid bij patienten met AN en BN door psychotherapie kan verbeteren, en dat de tijdsduur van 1 jaar misschien te kort was om ook het mentaliseren te zien verbeteren. De uitkomst dat herstel van AN en BN samenhing met beter mentaliseren en met toegenomen autonomie suggereert dat beide zaken van belang zijn om van gestoord eetgedrag en een obsessie voor gewicht af te kunnen komen, en derhalve in behandeling aandacht dienen te krijgen.",

      "title": "Insomnia associated with medical disorders",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is frequently associated with different medical disorders. This may be due to a variety of reasons: repercussions on sleep of the symptoms pertaining to these illnesses, e.g. pain, dyspnoea, nycturia, reduced motility, pruritus; anxiety or even depressive moods induced by the handicap, a failure to understand the course of illness, sometimes the risk to life itself; the adverse effects of certain medications used. This chapter will deal with the sleep disorders encountered in heart, respiratory, gastro-intestinal, renal, rheumatic, endocrine and metabolic conditions. For insomnias related to neurological diseases, the reader should refer to chapter 57 \"Sleep and lesions in the CNS\" and for insomnia within a framework of fibromyalgia, to chapter 60 \"Fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome: the role of sleep disturbances\". As a general rule, the treatment of sleep disturbances associated with medical disorders comes under the treatment of the diseases themselves. Nevertheless it is important to take account of the associated psychological factors, such as anxiety brought on by the illness, stress provoked by a stay in hospital, the possible pain involved in explorations, a scheduled surgical operation, which quite naturally lead to proposing anxiolytic or hypnotic treatment. But there may be drawbacks to prescribing such treatment: it may have a detrimental effect on the immediate course of illness, as in the effect of benzodiazepines on respiratory failure, for example; a risk of tolerance or dependency due to the chronic nature of the underlying illness, not to mention a lack of understanding of the hypnotic effects or non-effects on the sleep of subjects affected by various types of illness.",

Minor adverse sedation-related events may present inconvenience or transient discomfort to the patient and, if recognized and supported in a timely manner by the sedationist, will not usually result in physiologic or psychological harm to the patient. Postprocedure vomiting, transient hypoxemia, mild hypotension, emergence reactions, and prolonged recovery times are examples of minor events. The relative likelihood of events of this type (1 of every 200 sedation episodes) provides significant impetus for effective preparation and training for sedationists to effectively respond to or preempt them.

However, diagnostic problems of shunt dysfunction are difficult and thus important. The typical symptoms of shunt failure such as headache, nausea, vomiting, lethargy, irritability, mental status changes, behavioural disturbances are unspecific and sometimes minimal. Headache as the commonest symptom of shunt dysfunction has various other aetiologies; a first episode of migraine is especially difficult to differentiate from shunt failure. Nausea, vomiting and abdominal pain might also be related to gastroenteritis and consecutive dehydration might provoke symptoms of over drainage. Both, over drainage or infection can mimic the symptoms of drainage failure. Seizures as a warning sign are rare; but epilepsy as a comorbidity frequent. Neurological examination, although very important is not always very informative: papilledema and other signs of pressure develop only over time. Especially in children with spina bifida, new onset of brainstem and cranial nerve abnormalities are hints for shunt dysfunction.",

      "title": "Treatment of Mental Health in Patients With Chronic Liver Disease",
      "abstract": "Answer questions and earn CME Content available: Author Interview and Audio Recording The term depression represents a constellation of symptoms that are largely nonspecific in respect to diagnosis. At one extreme is an \"everyday depression,\" a person's experience in the face of a specific challenge, such as paying one's taxes. At the opposite extreme is major depressive disorder (MDD) described by profound subjective hopelessness, helplessness, and worthlessness. Biological symptoms occur, including sleep continuity disorder with early-morning awakening, a diurnal variation of mood, and anhedonia. Because of their nonspecificity, other conditions may easily mimic depression, including symptoms of chronic liver disease (CLD), such as hepatic encephalopathy (HE) and delirium. The key therefore is to apply careful, psychiatric differential diagnoses, especially in CLD. Notably, this article focuses on depression and anxiety, while important coexisting or independent mental health conditions, such as bipolar disorder, panic disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and substance abuse, are not discussed. In any evaluation of a patient with depression and/or anxiety, the aforementioned mental health disorders should be evaluated for and managed appropriately. Patients with CLD can have profoundly altered pharmacokinetics resulting in higher systemic drug levels. Portosystemic shunting in cirrhosis reduces the first-pass metabolism of high-extraction medications.1 The volume of distribution (Vd) is further impacted by decreased transport proteins and ascites and peripheral edema. In addition, drugs eliminated by hepatic metabolism or biliary excretion can have dramatically reduced clearance. The stage of cirrhosis and location of pathology also affect drug metabolism, with glucuronidation often preserved in early cirrhosis compared with cytochrome P450 enzymatic activity, while entities affecting the centrilobular region, such as alcohol-related liver disease, where oxidative functions are focused, impact enzymatic activity to a different degree to a disease affecting the portal region.1 There are additional complexities to consider in CLD, including HE and benzodiazepine sensitivity. In patients with severe MDD (9-item patient health questionnaire [PHQ-9] ≥ 20), the preferred initial treatment is pharmacotherapy plus psychotherapy, which is more efficacious than either treatment modality alone (Fig. 1).2 Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be considered for severe suicidality. For mild-to-moderate MDD (PHQ-9 < 20), initial monotherapy with either second-generation antidepressants (SGAs), such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) (Table 1), or psychotherapy is reasonable.3 SGAs and psychotherapy have each shown efficacy as monotherapies and have comparable efficacy and tolerability.3 SGAs are the first-line pharmacological agents due to their efficacy and safety (remission rate of 43% versus 29% in placebo)4 and are comparable across and within respective categories.5 The seminal STAR*D study, which captured a broadly \"real-world\" representative patient sample with both medical and psychiatric comorbidities, reported a 37% remission rate with citalopram as first-line therapy.6 Given the comparable efficacy among SGAs, drug selection is based on symptoms, adverse effects, comorbidities, patient preference, affordability, and prior medication experiences. Importantly, SGAs are low-risk hepatotoxic medications with only rare asymptomatic mild elevation of serum aminotransferases (0.5-1%). A specific concern for SSRIs in CLD is their association with gastrointestinal bleeding partly attributed to serotonin transporter inhibition on platelets affecting platelet aggregation after vascular injury.1 Although the clinical evidence is mixed, caution should still be used with coprescribing of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and antiplatelets.1 Concomitant proton pump inhibitors can be considered to mitigate the risk for bleeding in the more vulnerable patients who have thrombocytopenia or additional risk factors for bleeding. The atypical antidepressant, bupropion, is useful in mitigating sexual dysfunction given the lower rate versus SSRIs/SNRIs (6% versus 16%) or for treating comorbid tobacco dependence, whereas mirtazapine should be avoided in patients with features of metabolic syndrome (~3 kg weight gain after 8 weeks).7 Trazodone is useful for insomnia given its higher rate of somnolence versus SGAs, including mirtazapine (42% versus 25%), and can be considered as first-line therapy if insomnia is a large component of the somatic symptoms, with mirtazapine as an alternative.7 The adverse effects of tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors limit their routine use. Antidepressants should be initiated with low doses.1 In CLD, no change is required in the initial dose for SSRIs/SNRIs; however, a target maintenance dose of half of standard dosing is recommended.1 Subsequent titration is based on the balance of response and adverse effects. The dosing principles of SSRIs/SNRIs are the same for TCA use in CLD; however, the risk for HE precipitation needs consideration. It is also recommended to reduce the bupropion and mirtazapine dose by 50%.1 Time to improvement is around 2 weeks; however, most patients do not achieve remission after initial treatment,7 necessitating therapy switch or augmentation with additional interventions. Should patients display minimal improvement after 4 to 6 weeks, the next treatment step is titration to the maximum tolerated dose, an early switch to an alternative SGA,8 or augmentation with psychotherapy.9 The previously referenced STAR*D experience reported 31%, 14%, and 13% remission rates for second, third, and fourth acute pharmacotherapy treatment steps, respectively.6 No one psychotherapy is clearly superior in MDD; however, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or interpersonal psychotherapy are first line because they have been more widely studied.10 CBT involves identifying and changing maladaptive beliefs, improving emotional regulation, and developing personal coping strategies. CBT is effective as monotherapy with higher remission rates achieved versus controls (waiting list or usual care) (41% versus 21%).10 Interpersonal psychotherapy is an attachment-focused psychotherapy that centers on resolving interpersonal problems and symptomatic recovery.10 An important consideration is a patient's willingness to engage fully in psychotherapy, which is crucial in optimizing behavioral intervention efficacy. There are additional behavioral therapies that can be considered, including family therapy, problem-solving therapy, and relaxation techniques. Exercise programs can also be considered depending on tolerability and illness extent.11 Anxiety symptoms are likewise nonspecific and require careful differential diagnosis. Treatment can be deferred with clinical follow-up in mild generalized anxiety disorder (GAD; GAD-7 < 10) if symptoms do not interfere significantly with functioning. For patients who warrant treatment, SSRIs/SNRIs and/or CBT are the established first-line interventions (Fig. 1).12 The benefit of medication and CBT are similar, and the choice of which to use, if not using both, is determined by patient preference, availability, affordability, and adverse effects. There are no differences in the efficacy between SSRIs/SNRIs, and their dosing in CLD is the same as for MDD.12 Patients who have a suboptimal response to a SSRI/SNRI after 4 to 6 weeks should be reassessed for co-occurring untreated conditions or ongoing stressors requiring greater problem-solving focus. If no co-occurring exacerbating factors are elicited, then a different SSRI/SNRI should be initiated. If no response occurs after two SSRI/SNRI trials, then augmentation with either a nonaddictive second-line medication (e.g., buspirone, pregabalin, or hydroxyzine) or CBT should be initiated. Hydroxyzine is useful for short-term control of anxiety symptoms, in lieu of benzodiazepines. If benzodiazepines are being considered in CLD, then short-acting benzodiazepines such as lorazepam (which has no active metabolites) should be prescribed to mitigate the risk for drug accumulation. However, the risk for benzodiazepine dependence, whereby patients develop various behavioral and physical symptoms, including tolerance (loss of efficacy over time) and a withdrawal syndrome with medication cessation, limits their utility. Moreover, patients with CLD treated with at least 3 days of benzodiazepines are at a high risk for developing first-time HE possibly related to increased cerebral benzodiazepine receptor availability in CLD, particularly among patients with alcohol use disorder. Notably, pregabalin (through its agonism of GABA) and hydroxyzine (via its anticholinergic effects) can also increase the risk for HE, and thus patients with CLD who are taking these medications should be monitored carefully. Aerobic exercise, mindfulness-based stress reduction, and yoga may also be worthwhile adjunctive treatments.13 In addition, web-based and telehealth interventions will continue to be incorporated into patient management in the near future.14 If effective, medication for GAD should be continued for at least 12 months given the lower relapse rate versus 6 months of therapy (8.8% versus 53.7%).15 If the patient relapses after cessation of an effective medication, the same medication can be restarted and the treatment course extended.",

      "abstract": "Razvojni poremećaj koordinacije (RPK) predstavlja neurološki poremećaj, odnosno poremećaj pokreta (procesa ideje, motornog planiranja i izvršenja pokreta). RPK utiče na svakodnevne veštine ali i na školska postignuća. Visoka prevalencija (5-8 %) govori u prilog tome da u svakom razredu ili vrtićkoj grupi možemo očekivati jedno dete/učenika za ovim problemom. Danas, za dijagnostikovanje ovog poremećaja koristimo DSM-V (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition) klasifikaciju (četiri kriterijuma). Prema ovom statističkom priručniku RPK se dijagnostikuje ako je izvođenje motoričkih veština ispod hronološkog uzrasta, ako ometa svakodnevne aktivnosti, ako je početak u razvojnom periodu i ako se motorički deficit ne može objasniti nekim drugim oštećenjem (npr. cerebralnom paralizom). Etilogija RPK je multifaktorska. Najviše problema učenici sa RPK pokazuju na nastavi fizičkog vaspitanja, srpskog jezika i matematike. Teškoće sa kojima se susreću su mnogobrojne počev od problema pripreme za čas fizičkog vaspitanja, učešća u takmičarskim igrama, preko problema čitanja, pisanja i računanja. U osnovi ovih teškoća leži problem motoričkog učenja. Zbog svega, vrlo je važno koristiti odgovarajuće strategije za rad sa ovim učenicima. Pravovremenim tretmanom, primenom odgovarajućih metoda i strategija u radu može se uticati na dalji tok i ishod ovog razvojnog poremećaja.",

      "title": "P288 Somatic complaints in anxiety disorders",
      "abstract": "<h3>Background</h3> Conclusions of current state of the art report that 50% of all children and adolescents outpatient visits to a paediatrician are determined by a physical/somatic complaint. After medical evaluation, a third of these complaints have no apparent organic cause, thereby becoming a medically unexplained symptom. Somatic complaints have become a topic of research in child and adolescent psychiatric literature, as these are often correlated with anxiety disorders in this age category. Separation anxiety disorder, panic disorder or scholar phobia (scholar refusal) for which physical symptoms are a part of the <i>DSM</i> diagnostic criteria are associated with increased somatic complaints. The term school phobia was first used in 1941 to identify children who fail to attend school because attendance causes emotional distress and anxiety, but since the early 2000's the term school refusal is preferred. Children who refuse to attend school usually try to win a parent's permission to stay home, although some simply refuse to leave the house. In recent studies, the most commonly endorsed somatic symptoms in children and adolescent sample of school refusers were gastrointestinal items: nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and stomach pains. Another physical symptoms are common and include dizziness, headaches, shaking or trembling, fast heart rate, chest pains, and back, joint pains. These symptoms usually improve once the child is allowed to stay home. Behavioural symptoms include temper tantrums, crying, angry outbursts, and threats to hurt themselves. Usually, for parents, somatic symptoms outweigh the concerns, fears, and child's refusal to attend the tests or going to school, so parents repeatedly address the family doctor or paediatrician. <h3>Conclusions</h3> This paper aims to emphasise the importance of completing medical history and laboratory investigations with data that may suggest a psychogenic cause of somatic complaints. After excluding organic causes, it is important for paediatric patients to be oriented to mental health services for early intervention. This is important to delineate because the longer is the period of missing school the harder it is the educational reintegration. The long term consequences are unfavourable for the child including loss of peer relationships and academic difficulties.",

People with ON may avoid specific foods, food additives, dyes, or preservatives, and non-organic or genetically modified foods seen as “impure” or “unnatural,” often engaging in compulsive checking, reassurance seeking, decontamination, or other rituals to ensure that food “rules” are followed and that food is “healthy” and “pure.” ON is distinguished from healthy orthorexia, a non-impairing interest in healthy eating and nutrition. The distinction between ON and eating disorders involving obsessions about weight and shape and restrictive eating motivated by fear of weight gain is less clear. In this chapter, ON and related eating disorder symptoms associated with the diagnoses of anorexia nervosa, atypical anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, and avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder are conceptualized as obsessive-compulsive phenomena. Special considerations for exposure and response interventions for patients with clinically significant restrictive eating are described, including recommendations for when to refer patients to eating disorder specialists.",

Profoundly affect the quality of life and even put it at risk. The aim of this study was to analyze sleep disorders in childhood . Literature Review: A review was made on aspects of normal sleep ontogenesis and management of sleep disorders most prevalent in childhood. Were selected scientific articles in SciELO database, using the keywords sleep disorders and childhood. Second, the literature studied can classify the sleep disorders in four clinical groups: a) are those in which primary sleep disorder is the main or only symptom, eg, nightmares, night terrors, insomnia, hypersomnia, sleep paralysis and narcolepsy b) secondary sleep disorders is only one aspect of a complex clinical change, such as schizophrenia, depression or thyroid dysfunction c) parasomnias activities are not indicative of pathology when awake, but they are certainly not during sleep as sleepwalking, bedwetting, bruxism and nocturnal jactatio capitis d) clinical changes that can be influenced by sleep, but little influence, such as paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. In pediatric clinic the most frequent parasomnias and changes primary sleep. The insomnia generally results from poor educational practice and / or emotional disturbances. Remember that children with obstructive sleep disorders have worse results in the test of learning and memory. Conclusion: Sleep disturbances are very frequent complaints in pediatric outpatient clinics, and a correct diagnosis is essential for the establishment of appropriate therapy. In most cases, clinical history is sufficient for the diagnosis and assuring parents the mercy of the problem, and the best treatment.",

There seems to be no prognostic value to the pathological, physiological or psychological factors with which the first convulsion is associated. 3. Those cases where the convulsions occur without any apparent exciting factor (that is without trauma, teething, gastro-intestinal upsets, etc.) are invariably more significant and the prognosis should be more guarded than those cases where the convulsion is associated with some definite etiology. 4. In a fairly large group of cases, the convulsion is but a symptom of an unstable nervous system, one that is unable to withstand the ordinary vicissitudes to which the normal child is subjected. 5. There is undoubtedly a fairly large group of convulsive disorders in childhood where the convulsions are symptoms of an undiagnosed meningitis or encephalitis, which leaves behind irreparable damage to the nervous system. 6. The convulsion itself, though not associated with any devastating disease, such as meningitis, or encephalitis, may produce damage from which the brain never recovers, as seen in: (a) Some of the spastic conditions which follow immediately upon a series of convulsions. (b) Those cases following convulsions without neurological signs, but which have to adjust on a very much lower mental level. 7. The convulsions associated with rickets and tetany may leave behind very definite damage to the nervous system. 8. There is reason to believe that if the infantile convulsions associated with rickets, gastro-intestinal upsets, and acute infections were looked upon more seriously, and a greater effort made to prevent their occurrence during early life, much epilepsy and mental deficiency might be prevented.",

      "abstract": "While REM sleep is the phase of sleep from which dream reports are most reliably elicited, dream reports can also be elicited from any other stage of sleep, including sleep onset and N3 SWS. Reports after awakenings from NREM stages of sleep tend to be shorter, less emotional, and less visually vivid than reports obtained from REM – but we do get reports of “dreams” from NREM sleep states. Indeed, you can get dream reports without REM when REM is chemically suppressed via antidepressant medications. Just as dreams can occur without REM, REM sleep can occur without dream reports. About 20 percent of awakenings after a REM episode results in no dream report. Activation of REM, therefore, does not necessarily eventuate in a dream or at least a dream report. In addition, children who have abundant REM do not consistently report dreams until visuo-spatial and cognitive skills have matured enough to support reporting of visual narratives (Foulkes, 1982). Similarly, patients with lesions in the orbitofrontal cortex, basal forebrain, and near the occipitotemporoparietal junction sometimes report complete cessation of dreaming (Solms, 1997). In addition, Solms emphasized that disconnection of the ascending meso-limbic-cortical dopaminergic tracts from their termination sites in ventromedial frontal lobes could also lead to the loss of dreaming. Given that this tract is associated with instinctual appetitive drive and motivational states, it seems reasonable to conclude that this dopaminergic system may participate in the generation of some dreams. The loss of dreaming in these patients is not due simply to an inability to recall dreams, as their basic memory and recall abilities are largely intact. REM physiology as measured by sleep EEG is normal in these individuals, thus REM is still operating.",

      "title": "ABC of the upper gastrointestinal tract: Indigestion: When is it functional?",
      "abstract": "Patients often complain of indigestion, but what do they mean? Indigestion is an old English word that means lack of adequate digestion, but patients and doctors interpret this in different ways. Many patients mean heartburn or acid regurgitation, the classic symptoms of gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. Some describe belching, abdominal rumblings, or even bad breath as indigestion. Others mean pain localised to the epigastrium or a non-painful discomfort in the upper abdomen which may be described as fullness, bloating, or an inability to finish a normal meal (early satiety). Dyspepsia is best restricted to mean pain or discomfort centred in the upper abdomen. #### Major structural causes of dyspepsia Overlap of subgroups of dyspepsia based on symptoms in patients with documented functional dyspepsia There are many causes of dyspepsia, but at least two thirds of patients have no structural or biochemical explanation for their symptoms. It has been suggested that dyspepsia can be subdivided based on groups (or clusters) of symptoms. However, subgroups have not proved to be of value in identifying the underlying cause of dyspepsia and overlap considerably. Some patients report having troublesome burping associated with abdominal bloating or discomfort that is transiently relieved by bringing up the wind. These patients have aerophagy, and repeated swallowing of air may be obvious during the consultation. History taking is key to identifying the likely cause of dyspepsia. ### Gastro-oesophageal reflux disease It is important and practical to distinguish gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) from dyspepsia. Frequent heartburn is a cardinal symptom of GORD; acid reflux causes a retrosternal or epigastric burning feeling that characteristically radiates up towards the throat, is relieved transiently by antacids, and is precipitated by a meal or by lying down. #### Uncommon causes of upper abdominal pain or discomfort that may be confused with dyspepsia",

      "abstract": "This critical review focuses on obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and its management from a dental medicine perspective. OSA is characterized by ≥10-s cessation of breathing (apnea) or reduction in airflow (hypopnea) ≥5 times per hour with a drop in oxygen and/or rise in carbon dioxide. It can be associated with sleepiness and fatigue, impaired mood and cognition, cardiometabolic complications, and risk for transportation and work accidents. Although sleep apnea is diagnosed by a sleep physician, its management is interdisciplinary. The dentist’s role includes 1) screening patients for OSA risk factors (e.g., retrognathia, high arched palate, enlarged tonsils or tongue, enlarged tori, high Mallampati score, poor sleep, supine sleep position, obesity, hypertension, morning headache or orofacial pain, bruxism); 2) referring to an appropriate health professional as indicated; and 3) providing oral appliance therapy followed by regular dental and sleep medical follow-up. In addition to the device features and provider expertise, anatomic, behavioral, demographic, and neurophysiologic characteristics can influence oral appliance effectiveness in managing OSA. Therefore, OSA treatment should be tailored to each patient individually. This review highlights some of the putative action mechanisms related to oral appliance effectiveness and proposes future research directions.",

The muscle jerks are not associated with arousals or awakenings. Prevalence is unknown but is believed to be rare. There is no difference between genders. It has a self-limited course, with resolution by 6 months of age in most infants. No specific therapy is necessary. Pathogenesis has been postulated to involve a possible developmental abnormality of the reticular activating system. Video-electroencephalography (EEG) and electromyography (EMG) monitoring during polysomnography demonstrate muscle activity with a frequency of four to five jerks per second, occurring in clusters lasting 3 to 15 minutes. It is generally observed during non–rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep but can sometimes occur during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. No seizure activity is present on EEG tracings.",

      "title": "Bulimia Nervosa and Depression, from the Brain to the Gut Microbiota and Back",
      "abstract": "Bulimia nervosa (BN) is a condition marked by a typical cyclical behavioural activity, characterized by restrictions, binges and vomiting, as well as a disturbance of the emotional value of food. Food stimuli acquire excessive relevance, giving rise to a succession of states of excitement and anxiety. The depressive condition accompanies very often BN. Most people with BN also experience one or more anxiety disorders. The aim of the review is to identify a link at a central and peripheral level that connects an eating disorder with a mood state. Altered nervous mechanisms are involved in BN. Among the cerebral areas, the insula is functionally compromised in BN. The insula is also implicated in depressive states. The insula is the primary gustatory cortex, where gustatory sensory information such as taste discrimination and higher cognitive functions such as food anticipation and reward are processed. The insula is anatomically connected to a wide range of cortical, limbic and paralimbic structures, and functionally implicated in high-order cognition, emotional responses, and empathic processes. The insula plays a crucial role in empathy, or in the ability to share the emotional states of others, and in particular negative emotions. In fact, the insular cortex is also activated in conditions of anxiety and depression. One of the pathophysiological factors that influences bulimia and depression is the composition of gut microbiota, as there is a strong association between the microbial signature and the brain function. Gut dysbiosis condition may contribute to the development of eating disorders, including BN. Dysbiosis may promote intestinal inflammation, alter gut permeability, and trigger immune reactions in the hunger/satiety regulation center contributing to the pathophysiological development of eating disorders. From this emerges the importance of adequate probiotic integration as a preventive and/or therapeutic tool in these pathologies.",

When an acute headache occurs repeatedly or episodically it is often a primary headache with migraine and tension-type headache being the most frequent cause in children and adolescents. A chronic or very frequent headache may be secondary to migraine. Headache disorders can affect the lifestyle of both the child and his or her family resulting in significant disability. This can include time lost from school and parental absence from work, while also affecting the child and parent interaction at home and the child’s social interaction with peers. The majority of children and adolescents with headache never consult a physician (Sillanpa¨a¨ et al., 1991).",

Recurrence was noted in 103 patients (19%) after gradual withdrawal of AED, over a period of 3-4 months. 424 patients (81%) did not have recurrence. The recurrence rate was influenced adversely by factors like adolescent age and later onset seizures, pre-treatment duration of symptoms more than 3 years, pre-treatment precipitating factors like emotional stress, lack of sleep and meals (however, number in each group is small), positive family history of epilepsy, focal neurodeficit, absence and myoclonic plus grandmal type of clinical seizures, paroxysmal generalized spike and wave discharges and generalized short polyspike and wave discharges in the pretreatment EEG, atrophic changes on CT brain scan (in small numbers), head trauma at birth or later and hereditary factors as etiology of epilepsy, and more than 30 number of seizures before achieving the remission. Factors like, sex, frequency of seizures, period of remission i.e. two years or more and number of drugs used to achieve remission, did not have any significant adverse effect.

The paradoxical contraction is likened to a focal dystonia similar to other dystonias occurring in the rest of the body. A recent study showed the effect of decreasing anal dystonia with added levadopa in de novo patients. However, more studies are needed to replicate the effect. Often, the treatment for chronic constipation is based on provider and patient experience, with more studies needed in this area as well.

As this disease is chronic in nature, food, lifestyle and medicine have influence on relieving and aggravating the symptoms of Sandhigata vata. Pathya refers to that which gives relief to the person by the use of diet, regimen and medicine. On the contrary, Apathya aggravates the disease. The Pathya and Apathya are effective tools in Ayurveda for diagnosis as well as management of diseases. These same factors when followed in improper way aggravate the condition of Sandhigata vata. The disease is characterised by various features like Sandhi Shoola (Pain in joint), Sandhi Shotha ( Swelling in joints), Akunchana Prasarana Pravritti Vedana (pain on flexion and extension of the joint) and later Hanti Sandhi (diminution of the movements at joints).

      "title": "Overtraining Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Definitions Functional overreaching (FOR): intensified training results in a temporary decline in performance. When appropriate periods of recovery are provided, a positive \"supercompensation\" effect occurs, with the athlete exhibiting enhanced performance. Nonfunctional overreaching (NFOR): an accumulation of training and/or nontraining stress resulting in short-term decrement in performance capacity with or without related physiological and psychological signs and symptoms of maladaptation in which restoration of performance capacity may take from several days to several weeks. Overtraining syndrome (OTS): same as NFOR, except decrement is long-term and restoration takes several weeks or months. Key point: the difference between NFOR and OTS is the amount of time needed for performance restoration; therefore, the diagnosis of OTS can often only be made retrospectively (3). Pathophysiology Unknown, biochemical/hormonal hypotheses include the following: glycogen depletion, central fatigue/branched chain fatty acid depletion, glutamine depletion/immune dysfunction, autonomic imbalance, oxidative stress, hypothalamic dysregulation, and cytokine release/inflammation (1,2). The mechanism triggering these changes often involves a training error that results in imbalance between energy expenditure load and recovery. This typically occurs in combination with a complex set of psychological factors and environmental stressors (e.g., monotony of training, excessive competitions, sleep disturbances, interpersonal difficulties, academic/occupational stressors, illness, altitude exposure, heat or cold injury, etc.). Epidemiology Most commonly seen in endurance events such as swimming, cycling, or running Prevalence and incidence data for true OTS are lacking; the lifetime prevalence of NFOR/OTS is estimated to be approximately 30% for nonelite endurance athletes and 60% for elite athletes (2,3). Important Differential Diagnoses NFOR/OTS is a diagnosis of exclusion (1). Common: caffeine withdrawal, environmental allergies, exercise-induced bronchospasm, infectious mononucleosis, insufficient sleep, anemia, performance anxiety, inadequate carbohydrate or protein intake, mood disorder, psychosocial stress, upper respiratory infection. Less common: dehydration, diabetes mellitus, eating disorder, hepatitis, hypothyroidism, lower respiratory infection, medication side effect (antidepressant, anxiolytic, antihistamine, β-blocker), post-concussive syndrome, pregnancy, substance abuse. Rare but important: adrenocortical insufficiency or excess, congenital or acquired heart disease, arrhythmia, bacterial endocarditis, congestive heart failure, coronary heart disease, human immunodeficiency virus, malabsorption syndrome, chronic lung disease, Lyme disease, malaria, malignancy, neuromuscular disorder, chronic renal disease, syphilis. Evaluation Thorough history including chief complaint, training program, diet, medications, nutrition, illness, review of systems, and assessment of training goals. Hallmark feature in history: athletes with NFOR/OTS are usually able to start a normal training sequence or a race at their normal pace but are not able to complete the training load they are given or race as usual (3). Initial laboratory examinations: complete blood count, complete metabolic panel, Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate/C-reactive protein, thyroid-stimulating hormone, iron studies, creatine kinase, urinalysis, and beta-human chorionic gonadotropin. Consider monospot, hepatitis panel, Lyme titer, toxicology screen, and chest x-ray. Prescribe absolute rest for 2 wk. ○ If mood is adversely affected with full rest, consider relative rest with well-defined expectations. If improved at follow-up, focus on adjustments to training and prevention (as follows). If no improvement, consider NFOR/OTS: ○ Will require prolonged training rest and further workup ○ Consider consulting with a sports psychologist and nutritionist. ○ Sequence of advancing activity should focus on frequency, then duration, then intensity (1,2). Monitoring Monitor performance in time trials and standard exercise challenges. There are currently no good practical biomarkers for NFOR/OTS (2). Psychiatric indicators may be most useful. Examples include the Profile of Mood States and Recovery-Stress Questionnaire for Athletes (1). A two-bout maximal exercise protocol has shown differences in hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal response for athletes with FOR, NFOR, and OTS and may have prognostic value (2). Prevention Considerations for coaches, athletic trainers, and health care providers (2,3): Maintain accurate records of performance and encourage athletes to keep a diary of training load. Emphasize adequate rest and \"time out\" periods when performance declines, when an athlete complains of fatigue, or after illness or injury. Individualize and supervise training program. Avoid monotony of training. Encourage and reinforce optimal nutrition, hydration, and sleep. Be aware of life stressors, and communicate with athletes about physical, mental, and emotional concerns. Consider regular psychological questionnaires. Schedule regular health checks with a multidisciplinary team.",

When there are evidences of associated functional disturbances in other organ systems or in the patient as a whole, or characteristic clinical syndromes are present, and there is lack of symptomatic or objective evidence of organic disease on careful examination, the diagnosis of functional gastrointestinal disorder is likely. Treatment of functional gastrointestinal disturbances rests fundamentally on the art of medicine in the treatment of the patient and not on the science of medicine in the treatment of a disease. The essential steps in successful treatment include convincing the patient of the diagnosis, improving and relieving symptoms and avoiding or adequately controlling recurrences.Psychotherapy is a keystone in the treatment of functional gastrointestinal disorders. Not often, however, are the services of a psychiatrist necessary.

      "abstract": "Fifty nine patients admitted with a diagnosis of psychogenic vomiting were classified into five patterns of vomiting: continuous, habitual postprandial, irregular vomiting, nausea, and self induced. The psychiatric disorders related to the onset of vomiting were either a major depression or a conversion disorder. Continuous vomiting was usually due to a conversion disorder, while in many cases of habitual postprandial and irregular vomiting, major depression was observed. The patients9 psychiatric disorders and vomiting patterns often changed during the clinical course. Assessing the psychiatric problems and vomiting patterns is important in the diagnosis and treatment of psychogenic vomiting.",

Traditionally and quite soundly it is considered that FD concerns group of psychosomatic diseases, however in its pathogenesis the big role is taken away to local motor disturbances (an antroduodenal dyscoordination owing to a disbalance of intestinal neuromediators and gastrointestinal hormones), and also to behavior factors (an alimentary stereotype, alcohol and a tobacco smoking) and to a chronic lesion of intramural nervous plexuses of a digestive tube by toxins of a pathological intestinal microflora.

Two patients are reported who had convulsions and/or delirium following sudden reduction in dosage after relatively prolonged addiction. The abstinence phenomena in both patients responded dramatically to reintoxication with glutethimide followed by cautious, gradual withdrawal. Other reports of withdrawal-like phenomena following acute and chronic intoxication are reviewed and discussed. It is the authors' opinion, based on strong clinical evidence, that glutethimide, like other sedatives, can produce tolerance, habituation, and addiction in some subjects when taken in amounts greater than 2.5 gm. daily. Most careful supervision of patients who are being given this useful sedative over a prolonged period is recommended.",

The clinical symptoms of this disorder are distinctive and form the basis for making the diagnosis. The severity of restless legs syndrome varies considerably. Some individuals have severe symptoms that cause repeated and prolonged awakenings. Others are aware of only mild symptoms at bedtime that prolong falling asleep. Patients may complain of insomnia, especially difficulty with sleep onset and repeated nighttime awakenings. Most characteristic of restless legs syndrome are reports of sensations deep in the muscles. This disorder may begin at any age, including during childhood. Restless legs syndrome is strongly associated with iron deficiency. It is also associated with pregnancy (especially the last trimester), kidney failure, dialysis, anemia, cancer, and other medical conditions that cause peripheral nerve and muscle disorders.",

      "abstract": "The restrictions imposed upon sexual activity by neck, back and radicular pain syndromes are of serious concern to the patient. In recent years the subject of When, and even How is raised with increasing frequency, and the patient expects the physician to reply with appropriate answers. The reply must be tempered by the level of the patient's recovery, the evaluation of what other activities the patient can perform without pain or with minimal pain and the method to be used. Sexual activity may precipitate recurrent pain or aggravate existing pain in the same manner as lifting, pushing, pulling or any other physical activity, if performed too early or too vigorously in the course of recovery from neck, back or radicular pain syndromes. In dealing with the problem of recovery from painful musculoskeletal or neuromuscular states, timing is of the utmost importance. Unless a timetable is specifically outlined, recurrences are common, and the condition may become chronic. The inability of the patient to deal satisfactorily with the sexual aspect of his daily living may, in itself, lead to emotional tensions and guilt feelings which may delay or prevent recovery. There is need to handle this problem at every level of the involvement in order to achieve a desirable end result-namely, the absence of pain and its replacement with pleasure.",

      "abstract": "__Abstract__\r\n\r\nThe term parkinsonism refers to a neurological syndrome defined by the combination of\r\nbradykinesia (slowness of movement) in combination with any of the following motor signs: tremor\r\nat rest, muscular rigidity, and loss of postural reflexes (1). This is an etiologically heterogeneous\r\nentity, which might be due to dysfunctions at various levels in the basal ganglia, and especially\r\nin the substantia nigra (SN) and striatum. The parkinsonism can be classified into four broad\r\ncategories: (i) Parkinson's disease (PD, MIM#168600), also called primary parkinsonism, or typical\r\nparkinsonism, which includes the common, idiopathic form, and the rare forms with a recently\r\ndefined genetic etiology; (ii) parkinsonism-plus syndromes, which include different idiopathic,\r\nbut atypical neurodegenerative forms of parkinsonism (additional motor neurologic features are\r\npresent); (iii) secondary parkinsonism, which is caused by known, non-genetic etiologies, such as\r\nenvironmental insults (drugs, toxins, viruses), inflammation, tissue infiltration/compression or\r\nischemia; (iv) parkinsonism in the context of other degenerative disorders, with or without a known\r\ngenetic cause, in which parkinsonism represents a minor, or occasional component of the clinical\r\npicture (table 1 ).\r\nIn the primary forms of parkinsonism (PD) the initial symptoms occur typically in one side of\r\nthe body, spreading in a few years to the contralateral side. However, a certain degree of clinical\r\nasymmetry persists during the more advanced phases of the disease (the body side where\r\nthe symptoms started remains the more severely affected). Moreover, these motor symptoms\r\ndisplay typically a substantial beneficial response to the therapy with levodopa. While the motor\r\nsymptoms dominate the clinical picture, many PD patients have also other, non-motor problems,\r\nsuch as fatigue, depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances, constipation, bladder and other autonomic\r\ndisturbances, and sensory complaints (2).\r\nThe diagnosis of primary parkinsonism (PD) remains based on the presence of the clinical\r\nsyndrome, and the exclusion of other (secondary) causes.",

      "title": "Social aspects of epilepsy.",
      "abstract": "The diagnosis of epilepsy is always a s0.urce of sh?ck to the family and is frequently accompamed by anXIety concerning the cause. In extreme cases the diagnosis can even lead to suicide. Parents feel guilty and search for reasons why this has happened to one of their children. Is it attributable to some defect in their family, such as an alcoholic uncle or a mentally disturbed relative, or to their own misdeeds? The mother may blame herself for trying to avoid pregnancy, or for an attempted termination, or just not wanting the child. Arising from these deeply-felt feelings and anxieties the child may be rejected or overprotected. . The child who has epilepsy will have to grow up ID an atmosphere of anxiety about his condition. Parents are concerned about their responsibility and how far they can allow the child to follow a normal existence. There may be disputes about this, and as to how far the child should be subject to the same discipline as the other children. The child may endure many restrictions (swimming, riding a bicycle, etc), limitations on activities or going out with other children. Drugs may have to be taken-a nuisance in itself-and he will suffer the effects of taking drugs even if these are minimal. There may be difficulty in keeping up with schooling, and in many ways he will feel different from other children. Later the inability to drive a car may be a social handicap. Epilepsy, to the individual, means a ~reat deal ~f uncertainty. Will a seizure interfere with taking an exan:nnation or an interview for a job, or plans for some social activity or a holiday? Epileptics may feel that the risk. of causing a disturbance at a cinema or a dance by havIDg a seizure is too embarrassing, and so they become more and more isolated. All these factors play a significant role in the development of the individual and his per~onality. There is no clear evidence that epilepsy itself causes behavioural disturbance. Occasionally the underlying cause of the seizure may be responsible for disturbed behaviour in a child or some cases of temporal lobe epilepsy cause behavioural disorders. The extremes of epileptic personalitv are more often the sort of behaviour which follows lo~g periods of institutional care and it is r~re ~o find someone demonstrating the old textbook epileptic personality outside of an institution. Nevertheless, many people who suffer from epilepsy do have some degree",

      "abstract": "Abstract Tourette's Disorder (TD), also known as Tourette syndrome, is characterized in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM‐IV‐TR; American Psychiatric Association, 2000) by the presence of multiple motor tics and one or more vocal tics beginning prior to age 18 and continuing for at least one year or longer. Although the motor and vocal tics do not need to occur concurrently, the tics need to occur several times a day or more nearly every day or intermittently with no tic‐free interval of more than 3 months for the diagnosis to be given. Motor tics are defined as sudden, rapid, repetitive, stereotyped muscle movements, and vocal tics are similarly rapid and spontaneous vocalizations or repetitive sounds. Motor and vocal tics can be further categorized as simple or complex. Simple motor tics are brief, seemingly insignificant movements involving one muscle location, for example a hard eye blink, shoulder shrug, head tilt, nose twitch, and/or facial grimace. Simple vocal tics are monosyllabic, usually meaningless sounds, such as grunting, throat clearing, sniffing, and/or coughing. Complex tics are longer in duration, can be mistaken as voluntary and purposeful, and involve the coordination of multiple muscle groups, for example spinning, jumping, bending, kicking, touching self or objects, and facial or hand gestures. Complex vocal tics include interpretable noises, such as barking, shouting, or chirping, as well as vocalizations, such as words, phrases, repetition of self (palilalia) or others (echolalia). Coprolalia (e.g., profane language), often thought to be a defining symptom of TD, is quite rare, occurring in only about 10% of cases.",

However, sleep disturbances may continue during postpartum period or even become chronic. The most important sleep disturbances during pregnancy are primary insomnia, sleep disordered breathing (SDB) and restless legs syndrome (RLS).2, 3 Sleep disturbances typically cause sleep fragmentation and deterioration of sleep architecture leading to sleep loss and daytime sleepiness, tiredness, fatigue, cognitive difficulties and increase risk for accidents.2, 3 The algorithm of the diagnose and treatments of the most important sleep disturbances in pregnancy is illustrated in Figure 1. Primary insomnia includes both initiation insomnia, which shows as difficulties to fall asleep, and maintenance insomnia, which includes nightly awakenings and too early morning awakenings (being unable to fall asleep again). The etiology of primary insomnia during pregnancy is multifactorial, and might be associated with physical (hyperemesis, nocturia, joint and back pain, heartburn, nasal congestion, thermoregulatory problems, contractions, fetal movements, uncomfortable or unusual sleeping positions, dreams and nightmares) and mental (especially depression and anxiety) causes. Poor sleep quality has shown to be associated with the increased risk of complications such as gestational diabetes, preterm delivery, prolonged labor and increased risk of cesarean section.2, 3 Constant snoring is a typical feature of SDB, which includes sleep apnea and partial upper airway obstruction. In pregnant women, SDB is often caused by partial upper airway obstruction rather than of episodes of frank obstructive apnea.2 Gestational weight gain and estrogen-induced hyperemia, mucosal edema and mucus hypersecretion lead to the narrowing of upper airways exacerbating the risk for SDB. However, progesterone-induced stimulation of breathing, sleeping in lateral position, and decrease in the duration of rapid eye movement sleep (during which breathing is more unstable) may protect against SDB. Furthermore, micrognatia and loose throat and larynx are important risk factors for SDB. In addition to snoring, other typical symptoms are headache and dry month in the morning and daytime sleepiness (most typically irresistible falling asleep when inactive). SDB has shown to be in association with increased risk for gestational diabetes, pregnancy-induced hypertension, preeclampsia, intrauterine growth retardation, preterm delivery, cesarean section and neonatal intensive care unit admissions.2, 4 RLS is a nocturnal neurosensory movement disorder, which is connected with dopaminergic dysfunction. Although the etiology is still unclear, RLS may be idiopathic, genetic, or linked to various disorders, especially iron deficiency. RLS is characterized by unpleasant irritation, creeping, crawling, burning, pins-and-needles or itching sensations, most commonly in the legs. The sensations occur at rest and worsen towards the evening and night. Also smoking, use of caffeine, some medications or alcohol may initiate or exacerbate the symptoms. Transient RLS in previous pregnancies is associated with an elevated risk of new transient symptoms in future pregnancies, as well as with an increased risk for future development of chronic idiopathic RLS.2, 5 An association between RLS and hypertensive pregnancy disorders has been shown.2 Sleep disturbances during pregnancy are known risk factors for anxiety/depression both during pregnancy and postpartum period.1, 2, 6 Sleep disturbances often herald mood disturbances, and pregnant and postpartum women with mood symptoms typically suffer from sleep disturbances, especially from primary insomnia which may increase recurrence of a preexisting mental illness.6 Detection of the origin of the symptoms is the crucial first step in the management of maternal sleep disturbances. For the diagnosis of primary insomnia, questionnaires are feasible and sufficiently adequate tools in clinical practice. Because of the mismatch between subjective symptoms and objectively measured sleep quality, polysomnography, which measures sleep stages, is rarely needed.2 Of note is, that the patient may express having \"worse sleep quality\" or \"insomnia symptoms\", which may not stem from primary insomnia, but are secondary for instance for SDB (maintenance insomnia), RLS (initiation insomnia) or mental symptoms (initiation and maintenance insomnia). If SDB is suspected, ambulatory sleep polygraphy, which measures breathing and blood oxygen level is nessessary.2 In RLS, type and occurrence time of the symptoms and relief of the symptoms by movement, such as walking or stretching the limbs, are diagnostic. As iron deficiency may induce RLS, measurement of serum hemoglobin and ferritin (+C-reactive protein) is essential.5 To detect mental problems, especially depression and anxiety, structural questionnaires can be used.2 Good sleep hygiene is the basis of the treatment of all sleep disturbances. It includes convenient temperature in bedroom, reduced late fluid intake to prevent nocturia, suitable diet in case of gastro-esophageal reflux, massage in case of muscular pain and use of comfortable mattress and pillows. For primary insomnia non-pharmacologic treatments, especially cognitive behavioral therapy, is recommended and effective. It can be carried out as individual or group therapy. Additionally, yoga, acupuncture, mindfulness, and exercise are safe and effective. In case of severe or persistent insomnia, a short-term use of sedatives (including sedative antihistamines), sleeping pills (especially benzodiazepine–like drugs) or low dose antidepressants (with sedative properties) can be prescribed after risks and benefits consideration. However, all these drugs pass the placenta and although no teratogenic effects has been shown, they may be harmful for fetus and new-born. A long-term use of sedatives and sleeping pills should not be offered, since they often leads to noxious effects, like deterioration of sleep architecture and dependence on medication. Melatonin or herbal preparations, like valerian, are not recommended for treatment of insomnia during pregnancy or lactation because of the lack of safety and efficacy data. In cases of insomnia due to aggravating of mood symptoms, antidepressants, especially serotonin reuptake inhibitors, may be warranted.2 The gold standard treatment for SDB is nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and it is shown to be safe and effective also during pregnancy. After the diagnosis of SDB, CPAP treatment should be initiated without a delay. Positional treatment, especially lateral sleep posture, is recommendable. In general rule, surgical procedures should not be performed during pregnancy for the treatment of SDB. Local nasal congestive and corticosteroid treatments reduce nasal mucosal edema and thus improve nasal ventilation. In addition, treating respiratory infections effectively and gastro-esophageal reflux with tilted position of the upper body while in bed or proton-pump inhibitors, such as omeprazole, are also important.2 For the treatment of RLS, per oral iron supplementation (accompanied with C-vitamin for better iron absorption; serum ferritin level <75 μg/L) is recommended. However, in severe RLS (and with serum ferritin level <30 μg/L), oral iron is often insufficient or has a too slow effect and thus intravenous iron, safe also during pregnancy, may be needed. In addition, folate supplementation is favorable for RLS and it is also advisable during the periconception and early pregnancy period for fetal development. In addition, the use of magnesium may be beneficial, although the efficacy data is insufficient. Furthermore, relaxation procedures, walking, stretching, massage, use of compression stockings while sleeping or a warm bath before going to bed may also relieve the symptoms. In severe cases, pramipexole, levodopamin/carbidopamin, opioids, bensodiazepins or gabapentin beyond the first trimester may be needed under a consultation of a neurologist, with the lowest efficient dose, although all these medications may induce risks and side-effects for fetus and new-born.2, 5 Although sleep disturbances are frequent during pregnancy, the sleep quality is not systematically assessed during pregnancy follow-ups. Furthermore, the research evaluating the reasons and consequences of maternal sleep disturbances and the safety and efficacy of the treatments are scant. Good sleep quality is, nevertheless, essential for good quality of life and good health state and thus additional research in the field is indispensable.",

      "title": "Hiccups as a myocardial ischemia symptom",
      "abstract": "A hiccup is involuntary, paroxysmal inspiratory movements of the chest wall associated with diaphragm and accessory respiratory muscle contractions, with the synchronized closure of glottis. The mechanism underlying this common primitive reflex plays an important role in protecting airways against esophageal aspiration. The hiccup reflex mechanism is based on the afferent pathway (vagus and phrenic nerve and sympathetic fibers innervating chest organs, the abdomen, the ear, the nose and the throat stimulation, and the stimulation of hiccup center in the central nervous system, mainly reflecting psychogenic or metabolic disorders) and the efferent pathway (phrenic nerves). An incidental hiccup is a common problem, usually resolves spontaneously and does not present a clinical issue. The clinical issue arises in the case of pathologic persistent hiccups or symptomatic secondary hiccups which may lead to significant fatigue, insomnia or depression. Generally, pathologic hiccups are associated with considerable discomfort concerning both the \"stigmatized\" person and his or her personal surroundings in which it evokes different emotions, from amusement through impatience to uneasiness and the suggestion of a medical visit as an expression of concern for a given person. The most common causes of pathologic symptomatic hiccups are nervous system diseases, either the central nervous system (proliferative, angiogenic, inflammatory disorders), or the peripheral nervous system: the irritation of the phrenic nerve (proliferative disorders, goitre) and the vagus nerve (otolaryngologic diseases, meningitis, esophageal, stomach and duodenal diseases, hepatitis, pancreatitis, enteritis). The vagus nerve irritation with subsequent hiccups may be caused by chest disorders (injury, surgery) and heart diseases (myocardial infarction). In the present paper we describe the case of a 62-year-old male with recurrent hiccups associated with exertion as a secondary symptom of myocardial ischemia.",

      "title": "[Malnutrition in anorexia nervosa: psychosomatic approach and multidisciplinary treatment].",
      "abstract": "Using the quantitative and statistical method to study the psychopathology of this disorder, we feel that melancholy underlies all anorexia, a structural psychological failing in the primary narcissistic personality instituted at the beginning of life. Melancholy entails its opposite, mania, manifested in anorexia through exhausting physical exercise and a perpetual binge-purge cycle, with continuous vomiting that damages teeth and the oesophagus, leading to malnutrition, dependence on laxatives, colic and inflammation of the anus. Amenorrhea increases the levels of cortisol, thus facilitating osteoporosis. Other symptoms observed include: cold skin, pain on sitting, lanugo, hair loss, low blood pressure, bradycardia, prolapses of the mitral valve or pericardial effusion. Less commonly, oedema or anaemia, despite the sufficient intake of iron and proteins. Sleep disorders and abandonment of normal activities have also been reported.Population of 30 patients previously diagnosed as having anorexia nervosa according to DSM-IV or CIE-10 parameters, without election by gender, either institutionalized or attending day hospital. Over 18 years of age and with their mental personality structure somewhat consolidated so that the results would not be altered by a lack of stability in this variable. This is a first exploratory statistical analysis with a transverse description of only 30 anorexic patients without any contrasting control group and is therefore not conclusive. The variables will have to be adjusted through larger subsequent studies to weigh up our observations.From melancholic mania, the patients feel unique and special, through being able to go so long without eating. There is a corporal pleasure in all asceticism, as consumption modifies the perception of enjoyment. This triumph in solitude may recycle the anorexic eating pathology and turn it into something hard to reverse. Poor self-esteem often surrounds this condition. Patients, fixated on the maternal image, tend to undervalue their own, unable to withstand the development of the body or the internal tension this entails.Controlled exercise, improved nutrition and hormone treatment are currently the combined therapies applied in AN, with agreement being reached with patients on a specific personal diet of low volume, attempting to ensure the necessary minimum of fat and carbohydrates. With simultaneous psychological attention through an integral multidisciplinary approach in order to reduce the high prevalence of partially treated cases that accumulate over time.",

The fundamental bases for the formation of bile reflux are the failure of the sphincter apparatus, antroduodenal dysmotility, elimination of the natural antireflux barrier. Gallbladder dysfunction and duodenal dysmotility are considered the risk factors for primary DGR. The leading mechanism for the development of DGR, DGER after cholecystectomy is a violation of gastroduodenal motility and gastroduodenal hypertension. These syndromes are formed also at gallstone disease and other organic and functional pathological conditions, including pancreatic insufficiency. The syndrome of chronic duodenal hypertension or «duodenal demon» is manifested by heaviness in the epigastrium, belching, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, flatulence, and stool disorders. It is supplemented by the phenomena of psychosomatic asthenization, decreased mental and physical performance, apathy, and a negative assessment of life prospects. The clinical features of hologenous diarrhea are considered, differential diagnostic signs of diarrhea in chronic duodenal hypertension and irritable bowel syndrome are demonstrated.The clinical and pathogenetic substantiation of the treatment of chronic duodenal hypertension accompanied by hologenous diarrhea with colloidal bismuth preparations is presented.

      "abstract": "Abstract Excessive and unexplained cry is a common problem with infants. Most of the causes are benign or easily treatable, with exception of a few. However, we encountered a 5-month-old, otherwise healthy male infant, who used to cry inconsolably every day on the afternoon for about 3 hours and then used to fall asleep. This had been going on for the last 6 weeks. After waking up, infant seemed perfectly normal. History, physical examination, and routine investigations failed to diagnose the cause. An electroencephalogram showed epileptic abnormalities. The “crying episodes” disappeared after starting phenobarbitone. Although two of the four criteria for diagnosis of abdominal epilepsy (AE) are impossible to be met in an infant of this age (because he cannot speak out his ailments whether he is having abdominal pain, headache, dizziness, etc.); still we believe that this was a case of AE. Various case reports have stated that “sustained response to anticonvulsants has been accepted as one of the criteria for the diagnosis of AE.” We suggest AE to be kept in mind even when dealing with an infant of unresolved excessive crying.",

While developmental milestones are usually normal in young children, older children have variable levels of intellectual disability. Neurologic examination is usually normal except for mild spasticity. Seizures are not common. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of ASPM-MCPH is established in a proband with biallelic pathogenic variants in ASPM identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Treatment is symptomatic and focused on interventions to address developmental delay / intellectual disability, speech delay, and behavior issues. The management of epilepsy and spasticity is as per standard care. Surveillance: Routine monitoring of: growth; response of seizures to treatment or new-onset seizures; management of spasticity; developmental progress, including speech and language development; educational needs; and behavior for anxiety, attention, and aggressive or self-injurious behavior. Assess family need for social work support (e.g., respite care, other local resources) Agents/circumstances to avoid: Limit the use of methylphenidate, which exacerbates hyperactivity. Genetic counseling ASPM-MCPH is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of an affected individual has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being a heterozygote (carrier), and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Heterozygotes may have mild microcephaly (-2 to -3 SDs) but do not have other clinical findings associated with ASPM-MCPH. Once the ASPM pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk relatives, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk, and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

      "abstract": "In developed countries, more children under 1 year of age die of crib death (sudden infant death syndrome, SIDS) than of all other causes combined. Researchers and clinicians have proposed many possible causes of SIDS, but the abrupt, unexpected death of some babies remains mysterious and frightening. Although infant behavior may explain some of these deaths, scant attention has addressed behavioral characteristics of babies who die without medical explanation. Any explanation of SIDS must account for the fact that most SIDS deaths occur at 2 to 5 months of age, acknowledging that a protective mechanism appears to spare babies before 2 months but then disappears. The respiratory occlusion reflex serves as an initial defense against smothering and can provide such an explanation. Infantile reflexes wane, after providing opportunities for learned responses to be acquired. During this well-documented neurobehavioral transition from subcortical to cortically mediated responding, some babies, viable for the first 2 months, may become especially vulnerable if they fail to acquire sufficiently strong defensive behaviors needed to prevent occlusion after the waning of the life-preserving reflex. Recent success of back-to-sleep directives, urging that babies sleep on their backs to avoid smothering, supports this hypothesis.",

      "title": "Survey of 100 Epileptics who have not had Seizures for Ten Years or More",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY The aim of this survey was to define the criteria for eliminating medication. In the first place the patient should not have had a seizure for 10 years. So long a period may seem excessive to some, but we believe that this study demonstrates that it is not too long; even after 10 years without seizures, several patients experienced them again when medication was stopped. As to absences, it is doubtlessly unnecessary to continue anti‐petit mal medication in many patients, but in all cases it is necessary to continue treatment to prevent possible generalized seizures. We propose the following considerations in each case: the clinical‐EEG form of the epilepsy; the number of seizures suffered by the patient, absence of repeated seizures or status and early initiation of medication; absence of permanent neurological or mental deficit; negative family history of seizures; absence of other antecedents, especially in the partial epilepsies (traumatic antecedent of epilepsy, however, is generally of good prognosis); absence of paroxysmal EEG abnormalities or prompt normalization of the EEG with medication (persistent focal activity does not however contraindicate eliminating medication when there have been no seizures). Abrupt elimination of medication is contra‐indicated; medication should be reduced slowly, generally over a period of more than 1 year. An increase in EEG abnormalities on reduction of medication makes a return to previous doses obligatory. Using these criteria, we have been able to eliminate medication in nearly half our patients. It is of course possible that some of them may have new seizures; according to Juul‐Jensen (1968), seizures may reappear as long as 5 years after medication has been stopped.",

      "abstract": "Emotional eating is a maladaptive generalized behavior to regulate emotions as a momentary solution, and it is characterized by excessive food intake during states of emotional excitement or stress. The heart rate variability (HRV) as an evaluative parameter of emotional regulation indicates that the decrease of the vagal tone in the HRV is positively related to deficient self-regulation that might be associated with dysfunctional styles such as emotional eating. The explanatory emotional eating theory sustains this physiological mechanism by suggesting the sympathetic nervous system's activation and the existence of physiological incompatibilities between the action of eating and the presence of negative emotions which, instead of inhibiting the intake, boosts it. Nevertheless, evidence on the relation between the HRV and emotional eating demonstrates a predominance of the vagal response against the lower food stimulus under stress conditions.",

      "title": "Blackout",
      "abstract": "Note that the terms ‘syncope’ and ‘loss of consciousness’ are not interchangeable as loss of consciousness can be due to either syncopal or non-syncopal causes. Syncope is a form of loss of consciousness in which hypoperfusion of the brain is the cause (from the Greek syn (together) and kopein (to cut), referring to the fact that the blood flow that joins the brain together with the rest of the body has been cut). Syncopal causes can be subdivided by mechanism as follows: • ‘Reflex’: this is believed to involve activation of a primitive reflex that leads mammals to ‘play dead’ when faced with danger. Their heart rate slows and their blood pressure drops temporarily, reducing cerebral perfusion and leading to syncope. Some people appear to have a low threshold for activating this reflex in specific situations—for example after standing still for a long time, after seeing something frightening (e.g. blood, needles), or when straining (micturition, defecation). • ‘Cardiac’: pathologies causing a reduction in cardiac output (such as arrhythmias or outlet obstruction) can also lead to syncope. • ‘Orthostatic’: orthostatic hypotension basically means low blood pressure on sitting or standing (as opposed to lying flat). When we stand up there is a sudden drop in blood pressure that we compensate for by vasoconstriction, particularly of the ‘capacitance’ veins in the legs. This reduces the intravascular space, enabling us to maintain the pressure. However, this vasoconstriction takes a few seconds, so to prevent a transient fall in blood pressure every time we stand, there is a temporary increase in heart rate. Patients with reduced intravascular volume (e.g. from dehydration) and/or in whom the normal autonomic response (transient tachycardia and peripheral vasoconstriction) to standing is blunted (e.g. due to drugs or autonomic neuropathy) are vulnerable to blackouts. • ‘Cerebrovascular’: these are non-cardiac structural causes of reduced cerebral perfusion, i.e. obstructions to the blood flow between the heart and the brain. They are relatively uncommon. The main causes of a transient loss of consciousness are summarized in Figure 3.1, with the most common in large font. You should also remember that patients may believe they have lost consciousness when in fact they haven’t.",

      "title": "Testing cognition may contribute to the diagnosis of movement disorders",
      "abstract": "Diseases with movement disorders may be difficult to diagnose, both at the onset, when motor symptoms are mild and not sufficiently specific (e.g., difficulty in manipulating objects), or at end stage when distinctive motor signs are diluted in a severe and polymorphous clinical picture (eg, gait disorder with postural instability and cognitive decline in aged patients). Erroneous diagnoses are not infrequent, even in the most common disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). [1] Some of these errors may be avoided if the cognitive dysfunctions that often accompany these diseases are included in the diagnostic criteria.\n\nIn general, the cognitive disturbances found in movement disorders are in the category of ``subcortical dementia,'' consisting of a frontal lobe-like syndrome, without genuine amnesia or impairment of instrumental functions (aphasia, apraxia, or agnosia). Except for a few illnesses, such as essential tremor and idiopathic dystonia, in which intellectual deterioration is absent, subtle but specific cognitive deficits can frequently be detected in patients with a variety of diseases accompanied by movement disorders. [2] This is explained by the neuronal pathways connecting the basal ganglia to the cortex projecting not only to regions involved in the control of movements (motor, premotor, supplementary motor areas) but also to cortical areas contributing to cognitive functions (prefrontal cortex). In each of these diseases, the loss of different specific populations of neurons in the basal ganglia produces not only a characteristic motor syndrome but also a recognizable pattern of neuropsychological deficits. The use of appropriate neuropsychological tests to detect these deficits can therefore contribute to the diagnosis of such diseases.\n\nThis brief review will not deal with disorders caused by subcortical lesions of nondegenerative origin (tumors, sequelae of trauma or stroke, inflammatory and metabolic disorders, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, etc.) or with easily identified neurodegenerative diseases, i.e., when motor disability is prominent …",

      "title": "Moving interventions from after to before diagnosis",
      "abstract": "Some twenty years ago, the onset of psychosis was seen as the first sign of a schizophrenia spectrum disorder. Large scale epidemiological studies have since shown that, before the first psychotic episode, several deviations of normal development take place in (at least part of) the youngsters who later develop schizophrenia. While in childhood there is an average delay in reaching milestones such as walking, talking and reading, the most salient deviation during the teens is the decreased interaction with peers and decreased academic performance1. Children who later develop a psychotic disorder may have some deviant behavior, with schizotypal or schizoid features, which is expressed as few (or no) close friends and fewer social connections in sports, teams or hobbies. Occasional perceptual aberrations and magical beliefs are experienced by some 40% of children who later develop schizophrenia2, 3. In the second decade, cognitive decreases become apparent, which can be observed as lower school level than that of sibs and parents, doubling of classes or even quitting school4, 5. Finally, after puberty, subclinical psychotic symptoms emerge (or increase), which indicates the ultra high risk (UHR) period. Of course there are many exceptions, and some youngsters will develop a first psychosis out of the blue, with perfect social and cognitive skills antedating it. Yet, at least half of psychotic patients show a trajectory which provides clues for early recognition and interventions. All larger cohorts of UHR individuals show that cognitive decline is the clearest predictor of transition to psychosis5-7, together with severity of subclinical psychotic complaints. Animal models, genetic information, imaging studies in high risk groups, studies in children with 22q11 deletion syndrome, and post-mortem studies have shed light on neurobiological deviations that take place in these early phases, before the so-called first psychotic episode. Decreases in GABA functioning, especially of Chandelier cells, reduced NMDA receptor activity, increased oxidative stress and insufficient scavengers (especially glutathione), increased pro-inflammatory status of the brain and lower mitochondrial functioning add to varying degree to an individual's susceptibility towards developing schizophrenia. Some of these neurobiological deviations can be measured in vivo (i.e., glutathione and GABA concentrations by magnetic resonance spectroscopy; inflammatory status by positron emission tomography), whilst others cannot (density of Chandelier cells). This knowledge provides a basis for potential targeted treatment of specific susceptible subgroups of individuals with the same phenotype, but is not yet ready for clinical use. Epidemiology, cohort and case-control studies provide evidence of several risk factors occurring in the teenage period that can further increase risk of onset of psychosis. Among them are drug abuse, bullying, social exclusion, sleep deprivation, stressful events, inflammatory conditions and immigration. At the same time, pilot studies on interventions in the preclinical period have been performed, that showed efficacy of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) (although not compared to an active control condition)8 and of nutritional supply of omega-3 fatty acids (although not replicated in a larger group)9. At present, we do not know everything we would like to know to act early to prevent transition to psychosis in vulnerable youngsters, but we do have some basic clues on which we can act already. Each year we wait to complete our knowledge, many youngsters go on to develop a schizophrenia spectrum disorder. This topic should be a high priority in psychiatric research, as even UHR individuals who do not develop psychosis tend to manifest (other) severe psychiatric problems. A psychiatric disease affecting an adolescent or young adult has a large impact on the person himself, but also on his family, surrounding and society at large. There are several ways forward, both for researchers and for health care workers. For the latter, schools are the most important partners for collaboration, since cognition is such an important risk factor. Cognitive decline is first detected at school, and lower functioning than in previous years, with a prominent deviation from sibs, should be a reason to contact health care workers who can screen for (subclinical) psychotic features. When these are present, a working alliance between mental care workers, family and school should be made to prevent further hits, i.e. prevent the youngster from starting to abuse drugs, actively avoid (or stop) being bullied and socially isolated, regulate exposure to stress and sleep. For researchers, individual neurobiological deviations at the UHR stage need to be tested for correction with specific interventions, such as supplementation with n-acetylcysteine to restore glutathione function, glutamatergic or GABA-ergic agents to improve signaling of the inhibitory interneurons, and omega-3 fatty acids or anti-inflammatory agents to restore optimal brain condition. In addition, CBT for UHR needs to be compared to other psychosocial interventions, and efficacy has to be tested at group level and in specific patient groups. In short, there is much work to do for all of us in order to prevent transition to psychosis of vulnerable youngsters, and we need to make haste. Iris E.

      "title": "Depression, anxiety and stress among pregnant women: A community-based study",
      "abstract": "Sir, Pregnancy is supposed to be a time of emotional well-being in a woman's life, but for many women, this is a time of confusion, fear, sadness, anxiety, stress, and even depression. Mental health, in spite of being an important component of reproductive health, is often neglected. Moreover, in the absence of systematic screening, most antenatal mental disorders are not detected. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, between 14% and 23% of women will struggle with some symptoms of depression during pregnancy.[1] Depression in pregnancy may diminish one's capacity for self-care, precipitating inadequate nutrition, drug or alcohol abuse, and poor antenatal clinic attendance, all of which may compromise a woman's physical and mental health, may reduce optimal fetal monitoring, and might restrict the growth and development of the fetus. Performing antenatal screening is justified and seems reasonable since most postnatal depressive disorders begin during or before pregnancy. Anxiety during pregnancy has been found to be associated with depression as well as adverse pregnancy outcomes. Various studies have shown a link between antenatal maternal stress and cognitive, behavioral, and emotional problem in a child. An in-depth community-based query has to be made during the antenatal period as most of the past studies have been hospital-based and postnatal centric. The importance of mental health in pregnancy can be emphasized by the fact that even the best obstetric care cannot give a desirable outcome of the pregnancy if the mental health issues of the expectant mother are not addressed at the right time and in the right manner. To generate local evidence to fill up the knowledge gap about the mental health problems faced by the antenatal females and to assess the prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress in antenatal females, a cross-sectional community-based descriptive enquiry was conducted from January to October 2014 in Ghazipur, an urbanized village in East Delhi which is the field practice area of our institute. One hundred and sixty-five antenatal women who gave consent to participate in the study and residing in the area for 6 months or more were included in the study. The study participants who needed immediate medical attention and/or participant with chronic mental illness were not included in the study. The tool used for the study included the depression, anxiety, stress scale. The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress was found to be 25.5%, 63%, and 23%, respectively. Figure 1 shows the distribution of depression, anxiety, and stress based on severity.Figure 1: Severity of depression, anxiety, and stress among pregnant females (n = 165)The increased vulnerability for mental illness in pregnancy can be explained by the \"Biopsychosocial Model,\"[2] which integrates the biological, psychological, and social factors to explain the occurrence of mental illness. Pregnant females have increased biological vulnerability due to the hormonal maladjustment, psychological vulnerability due to apprehension for new life of motherhood, and social vulnerability due to the added demands of family support and care during this critical phase of her life. More community-based studies need to be done to increase the database of similar bigger epidemiological studies to be conducted in different social and cultural settings in India. Our study provided a quantitative descriptive enquiry, but some sensitive issues can be picked up only by qualitative study such as in-depth interviews or focus group discussion. There is now a need to move toward quality comprehensive antenatal services. The findings of our study indicate the need to incorporate mental health components in RCH (Reproductive & Child health) program. At the present junction, universal screening may not be a suitable strategy, but surely, it is a desirable and achievable goal in the future. Longitudinal prospective research is needed to establish the temporality of the onset of depression, anxiety, and stress in pregnancy. A control group of nonpregnant women with a similar sociodemographic profile may be a good estimate of the actual burden of mental health morbidities in pregnancy. Repeated probing on several occasions can build up the rapport and gain the confidence of the victim, so antenatal care visits are an ideal option as there are multiple chances of contact with the healthcare delivery system. Our study provided scoping bit in the base of these hitherto less explored and less examined and underappreciated issues related to pregnancies, on which further studies can be planned on a larger constructive framework and better-resourced methodologies.

While the formal psychopathology of male anorectics is similar to that of females, there is often a different motivation for the initial weight loss in males. They are more often concerned with attaining an idealized male body and avoiding teasing or criticism about their appearance. When males become ill, they tend to develop the full anorectic syndrome or not to become ill at all. Recognition of the special needs of adolescent males for individualized treatment increases the change of optimal outcome. Anorexia nervosa and bulimia in the teenage male should be seen as an ineffective method of dealing with developmental crises by gaining a sense of effectiveness and control through weight reduction and food restriction. Treatment seeks to improve quickly the starvation-related aspects of the illness while attempting to find more appropriate methods of dealing with the life crises prompting the illness. The real goal of treatment is to make the anorectic or bulimic illness unnecessary by encouraging the patient to continue the work of individuation and separation so that challenges in development and problems in living are resolved in a direct rather than an indirect way through an eating disorder.",

Still others believe that too much food and too little exercise—too much alimentation and not enough oxygenation—cause an overcharging of the blood with uric acid, as well as other products of suboxidation, and that hence arise all or most of these nerve ills",

This method is also indicated in patients suffering from disorders of the central or peripheral nervous system which developed suddenly, such as a stroke or craniocerebral injuries, or gradually, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), dementia, and multiple sclerosis. It has become common practice in the cooperation between neurologists and a gastroenterologists to use PEG in patients hospitalized in a neurological ward with encephalomalacy and haemorrhage, or craniocerebral injuries (after the patient recovers from the acute stage of the disease and is transferred to a neurological ICU), as well as in patients with ALS in a progressive stage. We gradually extend the indications of PEG for other patients with neurological disorders such as patients suffering from dementia, progressive multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, and progressive polyneuropathy. Of 62 patients hospitalized in a neurological ward during a period of 4.5 years, 56 patients suffered from sudden disorders of the nervous system (strokes and craniocerebral injuries) and 6 patients had gradually progressing neurological diseases (ALS, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, dementia, and polyneuropathy).",

The epidemiology of chronic illness is not straightforward. The incidence (i.e. number of new cases) may be difficult to assess as the onset is often insidious or not obvious. In many examples there is a spectrum of disease activity and the point at which one is classified as a case is arbitrary, often depending upon individual ‘symptom thresholds’, or other cultural or medical factors. The prevalence (i.e. number of existing cases) may be difficult to assess as the disease may follow a variable course, including changes in severity, remission (i.e. temporary abatement), relapse, recovery, and recurrence. Nonetheless, it is important to have some indicators of both incidence and prevalence to inform both consulting room discussions and health service planning. In general, as opposed to acute diseases, chronic diseases have a low incidence and a relatively high prevalence (See also Chapter 3.).",

The development of the kidney, the major excretory organ after birth, consists of 3 stages: the pronephros, or cervical kidney; mesonephros, or thoracic kidney; and metanephros, or abdominal kidney, the definitive kidney. In humans, nephrogenesis and organogenesis occur from the 6th to the 36th weeks of gestational age. After 36 weeks, nephrogenesis is complete and each kidney has a full complement of nephrons. The extent of chemical-induced renal toxicity is related, in part, to the efficiency in which the particular compound is transported by renal tubules. Because renal tubular transport capacities vary with maturation, the degree of nephrotoxicity may also vary with maturation. The signs and symptoms of nephrotoxicity can appear acutely or insidiously. Unexplained acute renal failure, chronic mild proteinuria, or even hypertension can be a manifestation of nephrotoxic agents. Species differences occur, thus the need for studies in humans.",

      "title": "Forensic psychiatry approach to mental disorders resulting from substance abuse",
      "abstract": "In the last few decades, mental disorders resulting from substance abuse have become a frequent phenomenon, which features diverse forms and degrees of severity. In addition to being a medical and extremely harmful social phenomenon, substance abuse (commonly known as drug or narcotics abuse) is frequently a subject matter of research in many sciences or scientific disciplines, such as medicine, psychology, sociology, legal science, etc. Drug abusers may develop diverse mental disorders, which largely depends on the type of psychoactive substance which is being abused and the method of taking narcotics (including frequency, daily dose, mode of administration, etc.). In this paper, the author provides an overview of different types of mental disorders according to the applicable International Classification of Mental and Behavioral Disorders. The disturbance of mental functions due to drug abuse (which may or may not result in the development of a mental disorder) changes the perception and behaviour of drug users. The disturbance of mental functions becomes particularly prominent in the circumstances where substance abuse has turned into a drug addiction; the basic characteristic of the dependence syndrome is an irresistible urge (craving or even compulsion) to take the substance in order to enjoy its effects again or to avoid/relieve the drug addiction crisis or the abstinence syndrome, which may be extremely painful and agonizing. As a consequence of these mental disturbances and other disorders arising from drug addiction, human behaviour may be disrupted to such an extent that a person may demonstrate some criminal conduct, which ultimately makes these mental disorders highly relevant in the field of criminal law. Given the fact that the criminal offender is a drug abuser who may have different forms of mental disorders, there is a need to consider the offender's mental capacity (sanity), which ultimately makes these mental disorders highly relevant from the point of view of forensic psychiatry. The author's primary goal in this paper is to present the basic postulates underlying the perception of drug abuse and drug addiction in forensic psychiatry, both from the theoretical and practical point of view. In exploring the practical aspect of this issue, the author focuses on presenting the basic principles of forensic-psychiatric expertise of criminal offenders who have been diagnosed as having mental disorders caused by drug abuse. The expertise includes different aspects of assessing mental disorders: giving professional opinions on the offender's mental capacity (sanity), assessing the potential danger of recidivism or commission of a more serious criminal act, and giving proposals for relevant of security measures concerning the mandatory treatment of drug addicts both in outpatient clinics and in other relevant in-patient medical institutions. Given the fact that mental disorders stemming from drug abuse frequently have numerous financial, family and professional implications, the author presents some forensic psychiatric attitudes pertaining to the assessment of contractual capacity of these persons, the assessment of their working capacity (including the remaining working ability or temporary inability to work), the assessment of mental capacity for exercising the parental right or custodianship rights. In that context, the author provides the forensic psychiatric aspects of these mental disorders from the aspect of civil law. Drug abuse and drug addiction involve serious and complex socio-pathological problems which are difficult to treat/cure. This paper is the author's contribution to casting light on these issues, primarily from the aspect of forensic psychiatry.",

      "abstract": "Recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) in childhood is a common complaint that may be difficult to diagnose and manage. Apley has reported that 10% of children have three or more episodes severe enough to impair activity and function over at least a three-month period. RAP appears less often in preschool children and, when present at earlier ages, it usually occurs in brief episodes rather than the more frequent and intense pattern that is characteristic of the school-aged child. RAP is more frequent in girls and is particularly prominent as a symptom in early adolescence. Occasional abdominal pain is a universal symptom in childhood and its significance is often difficult to assess. A practical approach is to determine the frequency, severity, and limitations produced by the pain before further exploration of its cause.DIAGNOSISRecurrent abdominal pain in childhood can be divided into disturbances of gastrointestinal functions and a variety of pathologic disease or organic categories. A combination of the disturbance of function and other organic disease can also be present as the basis for the pain. Fewer than 10% to 15% of referred children reported in various studies have been found to have pain of organic origin. It is important to recognize that many patients and their parents are fearful of the pain as a symptom and are not easily able to incorporate a concept of disorder of a gastrointestinal function at the onset.",

They tend to remain in work despite their low wages simply to avoid becoming unemployed and risk social exclusion. However, working in low-income jobs for long periods creates stress and gives rise to further problems. Stress affects sleep patterns and leads to problems associated with food intake and nutrition, and thus to disorders of the gastrointestinal system. Cardiovascular and neurological disorders may occur too. A lack of finances, and the stresses stemming from that are statistically significant and a strong predictor of a worse mental state. There is also a higher probability of psychosis occurring. All this affects the entire family, especially children. The inability to invest money and time in their development is another consequence.",

      "abstract": "Autism is a neurodevelopmental condition that is typically diagnosed in childhood or later. However, its high heritability and patterns of expression of implicated genes may contribute to an onset in fetal or early infant brain development. Prospective studies of infants with a family history of autism or a genetic syndrome associated with higher prevalence are providing insights into the earliest manifestations of the condition. Contrary to earlier expectations, the earliest signs of autism in the first year of life appear to be in sensory and motor development. Prospective studies have identified overgrowth of sensorimotor brain cortices, reduced habituation to repeated auditory or tactile stimuli, and exaggerated pupillary responses to changes in luminance in the first year of life. These are followed by a gradual decline in visual attention to faces and eyes, and the emergence of early social signs such as reduced pointing and sharing, or reduced communication. Altered patterns of behavior (including focused interests and unusual play) also emerge in the second year. These changes are associated with alterations in brain oscillatory power and connectivity. Autism is often associated with other co-occurring conditions; differences in broader aspects of development such as sleep or fearfulness also emerge early in development, and relate to later cognitive and adaptive outcomes. Parental interventions that focus on supporting and following a child’s interests can support social communication development for some infants.",

      "title": "Young children with autism or autistic-like behavior",
      "abstract": "Autism is a neurological syndrome of many etiologies. The disease process is in the child—not in the parent's relationship to the child. Autistic children are identified by an age of onset under 30 months, severe impairment of social interaction, abnormalities in communication, perseverative routines, and abnormal responses to sensory stimuli. Symptoms can be observed in some patients as early as one hour after birth. In evaluating a child with autism, an extensive differential diagnosis must be kept in mind. The symptoms may be found in patients with a chromosomal syndrome (the fragile X syndrome), infections of the central nervous system (rubella, herpes simplex), metabolic disease (phenylketonuria, purine autism, lactic acidosis associated with autism) and space-occupying lesions (arachnoid cysts proximate to the temporal lobe). Medical treatments are in their infancy but specialized educational programs using behavior conditioning techniques are already improving the level of functioning of this patient group.",

      "abstract": "In this Clinical practice guide we examine the diagnostic and therapeutic management of adult patients with constipation and abdominal discomfort, at the confluence of the spectrum of irritable bowel syndrome and functional constipation. Both fall within the framework of functional intestinal disorders and have major personal, health and social impact, altering the quality of life of the patients affected. The former is a subtype of irritable bowel syndrome in which constipation and altered bowel habit predominate, often along with recurring abdominal pain, bloating and abdominal distension. Constipation is characterised by infrequent or hard-to-pass bowel movements, often accompanied by straining during defecation or the sensation of incomplete evacuation. There is no underlying organic cause in the majority of cases; it being considered a functional bowel disorder. There are many clinical and pathophysiological similarities between the two conditions, the constipation responds in a similar way to commonly used drugs, the fundamental difference being the presence or absence of pain, but not in an \"all or nothing\" way. The severity of these disorders depends not only on the intensity of the intestinal symptoms but also on other biopsychosocial factors: association of gastrointestinal and extraintestinal symptoms, degree of involvement, forms of perception and behaviour. Functional bowel disorders are diagnosed using the Rome criteria. This Clinical practice guide adapts to the Rome IV criteria published at the end of May 2016. The first part (96, 97, 98) examined the conceptual and pathophysiological aspects, alarm criteria, diagnostic test and referral criteria between Primary Care and Gastroenterology. This second part reviews all the available treatment alternatives (exercise, fluid ingestion, diet with soluble fibre-rich foods, fibre supplements, other dietary components, osmotic or stimulating laxatives, probiotics, antibiotics, spasmolytics, peppermint essence, prucalopride, linaclotide, lubiprostone, biofeedback, antdepressants, psychological treatment, acupuncture, enemas, sacral root neurostimulation and surgery), and practical recommendations are made for each.",

      "title": "Delayed onset and resolution of pain: Some observations and implications",
      "abstract": "Occasionally, pain after disease or trauma develops only after a prolonged interval. Examples include late-onset pains which first occur months or years following a stroke, spinal cord lesion or amputation of a limb; a previously experienced pain that is recalled years later; and latent pain triggered for the first time by a further insult in the same area. Late-onset pains may develop gradually or suddenly, and may be brief or long standing. Pains which develop after an innocuous insult may be associated with slowly evolving sensory changes. However, even long-standing pains, particularly those of nociceptive origin, may resolve sometimes after many years. Resolution, which again can occur gradually or suddenly, may be spontaneous or follow development of another disorder or after therapeutic intervention. The duration of this pain relief can range from minutes to an indefinite period. These clinical phenomena, and the mechanisms, including genetic factors, subserving them, have been little studied. It is postulated that mechanisms implicated in acute pain may not be the same as those that subserve pain that develops after a long interval. Those late-onset pains which develop slowly after innocuous lesions may be associated with a variety of slow anatomical, physiological and biochemical changes. In late-onset pains that follow a painful insult, however, memory of the former pain and threshold triggering factors may be particularly important. Further studies of these neglected conditions may lead to understanding of as yet unknown processes subserving pain and to novel approaches to treatment.",

      "abstract": "Compliance is generally defined as the extent to which a patient adheres to a treatment regimen and, specifically, takes medication as prescribed. While little research is available about the number of patients who consistently skip antidepressant doses, the literature indicates that about 30% of patients discontinue treatment suddenly within the first month. Both missed doses and abrupt stoppage of treatment place a patient at risk for experiencing discontinuation symptoms. A variety of reasons ranging from forgetfulness to lack of knowledge about the importance of taking every dose may lead to nonadherence to an antidepressant regimen. By spending time on patient education, providing reasons why patients should take every antidepressant dose, discussing alternative treatments, and conveying empathy, support for, and understanding of the patient, physicians may be able to minimize noncompliance and consequently decrease the likelihood that a patient may experience discontinuation symptoms. Discontinuation of an antidepressant can cause a patient to be irritable, experience severe dizziness, or act emotionally absent, which may have a sustained adverse impact both on job performance and on family and social relationships.",

      "abstract": "Soggetti portatori di disabilitŕ presentano spesso disturbi endocrini e metabolici, primitivi o secondari alla menomazione psico-fisica. La disabilitŕ č spesso provocata da malattie geneticamente determinate, da traumi cranici o midollari con conseguenti alterazioni neurologiche, o da patologie infettive cerebrali con esiti significativi. Si comprende quindi facilmente la possibile associazione fra la disabilitŕ e disordini della funzione ipotalamica e ipofisaria, con quadri di ipopituitarismo di varia entitŕ. Ne conseguono manifestazioni cliniche, spesso subdole e non facilmente diagnosticabili, almeno nella fase iniziale, che, se non vengono riconosciute tempestivamente, possono avere conseguenze serie. Ad esempio un deficit di ormone della crescita o dell'ormone tiroideo o una carenza di cortisolo, in etŕ infantile possono dar luogo a gravi conseguenze patologiche. Un'altra patologia associata alla disabilitŕ č l'obesitŕ, sia ipotalamica che conseguente alla scarsa attivitŕ fisica. L'obesitŕ facilita lo sviluppo di diabete mellito, peraltro associato talora a malattie geneticamente determinate. Pertanto in una struttura residenziale per disabili č necessaria la consulenza di uno specialista endocrinologo al fine di riconoscere tempestivamente, sulla base di esami clinici e di laboratorio, eventuali patologie endocrine e metaboliche. Questo consente di intraprendere subito una terapia sostitutiva. L'assistenza sanitaria specialistica comprende l'attuazione di schemi di terapia adeguati, la compliance alla terapia, l'attuazione di idonei percorsi diagnostici e di follow-up. Grandi difficoltŕ si incontrano inevitabilmente nell'attuare programmi di attivitŕ fisica e di dieta al fine di limitare l'aumento ponderale. Un corretto intervento in questo campo richiede la collaborazione fra lo specialista e la strut- tura residenziale che assiste il disabile e percorsi di facilitazione per queste attivitŕ anche attraverso convenzioni stipulate ad hoc. Č fondamentale, infine, l'ottimizzazione di un'assistenza multidisciplinare ben integrata.",

      "abstract": "Diabetic patients can be affected by a wide range of peripheral nerve disorders, the rarer of which are often poorly recognised and understood. “Insulin neuritis” or “treatment induced neuropathy” is a reversible disorder characterised by acute severe distal limb pain, peripheral nerve fibre damage and autonomic dysfunction, preceded by a period of rapid glycaemic control. The condition has been reported in both type 1 and type 2 diabetics treated with insulin or oral hypoglycaemic agents who typically have a history of poor glycaemic control. Pathogenesis of the condition and its associated pain is poorly understood, with proposed mechanisms including endoneurial ischaemia, hypoglycaemic microvascular neuronal damage and regenerating nerve firing. Pain can affect other areas including the trunk and abdomen, or be more generalised. “Diabetic neuropathic cachexia” is a rare disorder associated with poor diabetic control that presents with large amounts of unintentional weight loss associated with an acute symmetrical painful peripheral neuropathy without weakness. Pain is characteristically burning in nature with predominant lower limb involvement and allodynia. The disorder can also affect type 1 and type 2 diabetics and occur irrespective of the duration of their diabetes. Depression and in males, impotence, appear to be common, although other autonomic features can be present. Typically it has a monophasic course but has been reported to be recurrent. As with insulin neuritis, this condition is reversible over weeks to months after adequate diabetic control. For both disorders, the pain can be treatment resistant despite the use of multiple analgesics. Keywords: Cachexia, diabetes, insulin, neuropathy, neuritis, treatment",

      "abstract": "Non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) parasomnias are common across the lifespan. This article describes the manifestations, diagnosis, and management of non-REM parasomnias in adults and discusses the social implications of these conditions.Non-REM parasomnias represent a hybrid state of wakefulness and sleep, often triggered by events that increase the frequency of arousals or make it more difficult to fully arouse from sleep. Sleep deprivation, certain medications, and untreated obstructive sleep apnea are known to provoke parasomnias, particularly in those who are genetically predisposed. Non-REM parasomnias include disorders of arousal (ie, sleepwalking, sleep terrors, and confusional arousals), sleep-related eating disorder, and exploding head syndrome. Clinical overlap exists between sleep-related eating disorder and disorders of arousal, suggesting that sleep-related eating disorder may be a fourth disorder of arousal or a manifestation of sleepwalking. Exploding head syndrome is a unique parasomnia of uncertain etiology.Non-REM parasomnias can range from minor nuisances to severe, life-altering events. While some patients with non-REM parasomnia experience significant consequences during sleep, wakefulness, or both, non-REM parasomnias do not pose a major risk to most patients. For all patients with non-REM parasomnias, safety should be explicitly discussed and addressed. Nonpharmacologic treatment should be prioritized, as increasing total sleep time, avoiding triggering substances, and treating comorbid sleep disorders is often sufficient for the management of non-REM parasomnias. If symptoms persist despite these interventions, treatment with clonazepam or other medications can be considered.",

Diagnosis and management of IBS. We searched the literature for diagnostic accuracy studies, randomized controlled trials, and meta-analyses. A positive diagnosis of IBS, alongside testing to exclude celiac disease, is recommended. Exhaustive investigation has a low yield. Patients should be offered traditional dietary advice. If response is incomplete, specialist dietetic guidance should be considered. Probiotics may be beneficial, but quality of evidence is poor. First-line treatment of constipation is with laxatives, with secretagogues used where these are ineffective. Anti-diarrheal drugs should be used first-line for diarrhea, with second-line drugs including 5-hydroxytryptamine-3 antagonists, eluxadoline, or rifaximin, where available. First-line treatment of abdominal pain should be with antispasmodics, with gut-brain neuromodulators prescribed second-line. Low-dose tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline, are preferred. Brain-gut behavioral therapies are effective and have evidence for efficacy in patients refractory to standard therapies.

The notion of confusional arousals in children has received less attention overall compared with that concerning adults. The impression gained in adults is that, especially in response to forced awakenings, the behavioral disturbance in adult episodes is more forceful, vigorous and resistive, sometimes leading to violent behavior. Childhood confusional arousals do not usually require treatment, only advice to parents that they can be considered to be a passing phase. The same cannot necessarily be said of confusional arousals in adult life when they have more of a tendency to persist, depending on their etiology and relationship to other sleep disorders.",

Absent to decreased responses were associated with (1) a \"pandevelopmental retardation\" involving physical growth as well as postural-motor and visualmotor development, (2) an \"abnormally quiet\" state in the first month, and (3) failures of bimanual integration between 4 and 6 months. The transitory nature of the decreased nystagmus rules out the possibility of an organic lesion of the vestibular system.

Baby blues, postpartum depression, postpartum psychosis and anxiety disorders, are changes that can occur in the puerperium period. The mildest ant the most common difficulty is baby blues or postpartum grief, which last for a short time and passes without consequence for the mther and her child. In the most cases treatment is not required, support from the environment and the family is enough. Postpartum depression is a serious disorder that needs to be treated.\r\n Simptoms of postpartum depression are feelings of sadness, loss of interest, insomnia, restlessness, etc. Treatment includes pharmacoterapy for alternative procedures.\r\n Postpartum psychosis is rare but the most serious form of postpartum disorders and can have very serious consequences for the mother and her child (even fatal outcome is possible). It is treated with pharmacotherapy and alternative methods, but sometimes requires hospitalization in the department of psychiatry. Anxiety disorders are a group of disorders, that is divided into panic disorders, obsessive compulsive, post-traumatic stress disorders and other specific phobias. The cause of anxiety disorders are mainly genetic factors, unwanted pregnancies, unprepared mothers for the role of motherhood and sudden hormonal changes. A large role in the prevention of mental health problems is played by a health visitor whose task is to educate women and their families, before and after birth and contribute with advice and skills to overcome postpartum stress and inital adjustment. During the preparation of the final survey was conducted trought social network Facebook („MeĊimurske mame i trudnice“, etc.) collected was 134 responses from April to May 2019. Results have shown 67,9% of participants did not have any psychological changes after birth. Nevertheless, 32,3% have manifested certain psychological changes, with baby blues being the most common ( 17,2%) followed by postpartum depression (7,5%) and anxiety disorder (6%). The age itself does not affect the change, while understanding and family support do. Quality education and awareness of the mother is very important , but it is important that the information is verified and accurate.

The movements can be chorea, athetosis, ballism, dystonia, or a combination of all.[1] Paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia (PKD) is the most common type of movement disorder, and it can be primary or secondary to some illnesses and is precipitated by sudden voluntary actions.[2] The secondary causes implicated are trauma; stroke; neurosyphilis; encephalitis; multiple sclerosis; and metabolic abnormalities such as diabetes, hypoparathyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, and kernicterus.[3] Here, we describe a case of secondary PKD. A 32-year-old man with normal birth and developmental milestones presented with multiple episodes of dystonic posturing in the left upper and lower limbs precipitated by walking or activity for 10 years. The frequency of the episodes was 4–5 per day. There was no preceding aura, sensory disturbance, loss of consciousness, tongue bite, or urinary incontinence in any of the episodes. In addition, the patient denied any premonitory urge before the attacks, and they were not suppressible. Each episode lasted 25–40 seconds and used to occur soon after patient started walking and would subside spontaneously. There was no history of gait imbalance, cognitive impairment, or cranial nerve involvement. His family history was negative for similar complaints. He was treated with multiple antiseizure medications in the past with no relief in symptoms. On examination, the mini-mental state examination score was 30/30. His general physical examination was normal. His speech, cranial nerves, power, reflexes, and sensory and cerebellar examination were normal, and he was noted to have positive Trousseau sign. He underwent video electroencephalography recording with the possibility of seizures versus movement disorder. No epileptiform discharges were detected in both ictal and interictal electroencephalography. Routine investigations, including hemogram and renal and liver function tests, were within normal limits. The corrected serum calcium level was 5.1 mg/dL (8.6–10.2 mg/dL) and phosphorus level was 5.3 mg/dL (2.5–4.5 mg/dL). Serum ionized calcium measured during the dystonic attack was 0.8 mmol/L (1.16–1.3 mmol/L). Serum ceruloplasmin, peripheral blood film for acanthocytes, and thyroid function were within normal limits. Electrocardiogram revealed prolonged QTc interval. Non-contrast computed tomography (NCCT) head revealed calcifications in the bilateral caudate, putamen, thalami [Figure 1], and cerebellum. Subsequently, the intact parathyroid hormone level was 1.56 pg/mL (normal, 15–65 pg/mL) and vitamin D level was 40 ng/mL (11–42 ng/mL). He was managed with acetazolamide and high-dose calcium supplementation, following which the attacks remarkably diminished in duration and frequency at his 1-month follow up.Figure 1:: Non-contrast computed tomography head showing calcification of the bilateral basal ganglia structures and thalamiThis case is noteworthy as it remained a diagnostic dilemma for approximately 10 years. Simple investigations such as serum calcium and NCCT head clinched the diagnosis. A multitude of clinical features are reported in hypoparathyroidism such as seizures, tetany, depression, psychosis, and extrapyramidal manifestations.[4,5] However, case reports of hypoparathyroidism presenting as PKD are scarce.[6-9] The involuntary movements are due to low serum calcium levels; hypocalcemia renders the neuronal membrane hyperexcitable and leads to paroxysmal dyskinesia, but why the symptoms are paroxysmal is enigmatic. The symptoms usually respond to high-dose calcium supplementation. In addition, the dystonic movements can occur in the setting of normal serum calcium levels when there are extensive calcium deposits in the basal ganglia. Perfusion abnormalities have been noted in the basal ganglia of patients with PKD. The cause of hypoparathyroidism in this patient is highly likely to be idiopathic; we did not perform any genetic testing due to financial constraints. In conclusion, we report an uncommon but easily treatable secondary cause of PKD. Investigations such as serum calcium and NCCT head helped in the diagnosis, and the patient responded well to treatment.

      "title": "Clinical Practice Guideline: Irritable bowel syndrome with constipation and functional constipation in the adult",
      "abstract": "In this Clinical Practice Guideline we discuss the diagnostic and therapeutic approach of adult patients with constipation and abdominal complaints at the confluence of the irritable bowel syndrome spectrum and functional constipation. Both conditions are included among the functional bowel disorders, and have a significant personal, healthcare, and social impact, affecting the quality of life of the patients who suffer from them. The first one is the irritable bowel syndrome subtype, where constipation represents the predominant complaint, in association with recurrent abdominal pain, bloating, and abdominal distension. Constipation is characterized by difficulties with or low frequency of bowel movements, often accompanied by straining during defecation or a feeling of incomplete evacuation. Most cases have no underlying medical cause, and are therefore considered as a functional bowel disorder. There are many clinical and pathophysiological similarities between both disorders, and both respond similarly to commonly used drugs, their primary difference being the presence or absence of pain, albeit not in an \"all or nothing\" manner. Severity depends not only upon bowel symptom intensity but also upon other biopsychosocial factors (association of gastrointestinal and extraintestinal symptoms, grade of involvement, and perception and behavior variants). Functional bowel disorders are diagnosed using the Rome criteria. This Clinical Practice Guideline has been made consistent with the Rome IV criteria, which were published late in May 2016, and discuss alarm criteria, diagnostic tests, and referral criteria between Primary Care and gastroenterology settings. Furthermore, all the available treatment options (exercise, fluid ingestion, diet with soluble fiber-rich foods, fiber supplementation, other dietary components, osmotic or stimulating laxatives, probiotics, antibiotics, spasmolytics, peppermint essence, prucalopride, linaclotide, lubiprostone, biofeedback, antidepressants, psychological therapy, acupuncture, enemas, sacral root neurostimulation, surgery) are discussed, and practical recommendations are made regarding each of them.",

      "abstract": "See article on page664 \n\nOne of the commonest problems presenting in gastrointestinal practice is the patient with chronic or recurrent epigastric pain or discomfort where routine diagnostic testing has failed to identify a definite structural cause for the symptoms.1 Empiric antisecretory and prokinetic agents remain the mainstay of treatment for patients with a diagnosis of functional (or non-ulcer) dyspepsia, but only a minority experience complete symptom relief with these agents.2 Rational medical treatment for patients with functional dyspepsia remains an elusive goal partly because functional dyspepsia seems to comprise a heterogeneous syndrome.1 For example, approximately 50% of patients have Helicobacter pylori gastritis, up to 50% have delayed gastric emptying and perhaps 50% of patients have visceral hypersensitivity to mechanical distension of the stomach or duodenum1; clearly, these pathophysiological subsets overlap, although visceral hypersensitivity is currently postulated to be of central importance.3 4In addition to being sensitive to mechanical distension, patients with functional dyspepsia as a group may be more sensitive to other stimuli such as pentagastrin injection or intragastric infusions of acid, saline and pancreatic or biliary secretions.1 Although there is heightened visceral nocioception, somatic pain sensation is normal3 suggesting that the sensory defect is localised to the gastrointestinal tract, although these observations may also be explained by aberrant processing of signals at the spinal cord or central nervous system level.\n\nPatients with the irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) have well documented visceral hypersensitivity to mechanical distension of the colon and small bowel.4 5 Furthermore, rectal hypersensitivity seems to be inducible in patients with IBS following mechanical stimulation of the …",

      "abstract": "Shock is a pathological state in which there is an insufficiency in oxygen supply and demand. Ultimately, it results in global hypoperfusion and a resulting increase in anaerobic respiration causing lactic acidosis. Maintaining adequate oxygen delivery in the critical care setting is of primary importance in the management of a critically ill patient. When oxygen supply is inadequate, the body undergoes several physiological changes to maintain the oxygen delivery requirements and perfusion pressure. This stage is referred to as compensated shock, and early signs of shock may be appreciated during this stage. When compensatory mechanisms are inadequate and DO2 begins to fall beyond the critical point, shock has progressed to the uncompensated stage. During this stage, there is rapid deterioration of the patient due to prolonged hypoxia and anaerobic respiration. Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS) is the development of potentially reversible physiological derangement involving two or more organ systems not involved in the causative disorder, which results in persisting states of shock, sepsis and hypoperfusion and a major cause of high mortality in the intensive care unit reaching a range of 11–54% in septic pediatric patients. The final stage of shock is irreversible shock, which is also referred to as refractory shock. This final stage of shock carries a 96–99% mortality rate.",

According to The International Classification of Sleep Disorders, primary insomnia is a syndrome mainly composed of psychophysiological insomnia, paradoxical insomnia and idiopathic insomnia. Primary insomnia is difficulty initiating sleep (sleep onset insomnia), difficulty maintaining sleep (mid-sleep awakening, early morning awakening) or chronic non restorative sleep, which persist longer than three weeks despite having adequate opportunity for sleep and result in impaired daytime functioning. Primary insomnia is not explained by currently known psychiatric disorders, medical conditions, substance use disorders. Primary insomnia is a non-organic, unknown etiology, middle-aged female predominant sleep disturbance. Recent findings suggest the hyperarousal hypothesis of primary insomnia.

In this study, 50 violent offenders were interviewed with neuropsychological and psychometric measures, to determine the factors that underlie amnesia and the recovery of memory in these cases. The results showed that amnesia for a violent offense was associated with crimes of passion and dissociative symptoms at the time, but not with impaired neuropsychological functioning. Long amnesic gaps were associated with a state of dissociation surrounding the offense and with previous blackouts (whether alcoholic or dissociative). Memory often recovered, either partially or completely, especially where there was a history of blackouts or a lengthy amnesic gap. Brief amnesic gaps were likely to persist, perhaps as a consequence of faulty encoding during a period of extreme emotional arousal (or red-out).",

      "title": "Complete Remission in GERD",
      "abstract": "It seems self-evident that complete remission should be a goal of therapy for any disease that cannot be cured. Remission itself is easy to define: it denotes that a disease or disorder has become quiescent or suppressed to a point that it no longer causes morbidity. However, recent recognition that gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) may be associated with symptoms of irritable bowel and with other disorders raises questions about the specification of the \"reflux symptoms\" for which remission will be sought. Moreover, the fact that many GERD patients are content to take their acid-suppressing medication prn is evidence that total abolition of reflux symptoms is not what they seek in any case. Therefore, to consider remission in GERD it is necessary to first consider \"what is GERD?\" GERD is now often described as a family or spectrum of disorders, but the distinction is not always made between the spectrum of GERD symptoms, the spectrum of GERD pathology, and the spectrum of underlying pathophysiology of GERD. The 3 are linked, of course, but they overlap. The well accepted Genval definition of GERD is a pragmatic definition rather than one based on scientific principles, but it seems to have served the clinical and scientific community well. Its limitations are inherent in its focus on clinical features related to gastroesophageal reflux. Now that more is known of GERD pathophysiology, it is clear that the underlying abnormalities of GERD are not fully embraced by the Genval definition. Clarity about remission requires that the definition of remission and the specification of criteria for its attainment should be considered in sequence and separately. Consequently, no attempt is made in this paper to suggest criteria. However, notwithstanding the limitations of the Genval definition of GERD, there is merit in defining remission in similar terms and thus the following definition is proposed: \"GERD patients are in remission when they are no longer exposed to the risk of physical complications from gastroesophageal reflux and have no clinically significant impairment of health-related well being (quality of life) due to reflux-related symptoms.\"",

He points out that ideas of negation, systematic or asystematic, are very slow in appearing, and represent generally a phase of evolution of the psychoses or a secondary mental process. Their appearance coincides with the mental decadence due to chronicity or associated with senility. Certain congenital cases do not come under this class, and there is also a group in which there seems to be a “negative disposition” of the individual. From a clinical study one of the following factors is necessary to the production of these ideas: (1) a state of mental weakness produced either by an intoxication or by some other cause acting acutely, or (2) a state of acute, subacute, or chronic pathological pain, or (3) an originally degenerative condition.",

Detailed enquiry revealed the “hallucinations” to be “whooshing” noises in her ears precipitated by standing. She was found to have a haemoglobin level of 55 g/l, attributed to a combination of poor diet and menorrhagia.

The heavy school work lead to fear of studies that in turn affected the attendance and the scholastic performance. To some extent, the surrounding environmental factors also lead to difficulty in social adjustment. These certain issues lead to stress headaches for most of the children almost every day.

      "abstract": "Although abdominal pain is a symptom of several structural gastrointestinal disorders (eg, peptic ulcer disease), this comprehensive review will focus on the 4 most common nonstructural, or functional, disorders associated with abdominal pain: functional dyspepsia, constipation-predominant and diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome, and functional abdominal pain syndrome. Together, these conditions affect approximately 1 in 4 people in the United States. They are associated with comorbid conditions (eg, fibromyalgia and depression), impaired quality of life, and increased health care utilization. Symptoms are explained by disordered gastrointestinal motility and sensation, which are implicated in various peripheral (eg, postinfectious inflammation and luminal irritants) and/or central (eg, stress and anxiety) factors. These disorders are defined and can generally be diagnosed by symptoms alone. Often prompted by alarm features, selected testing is useful to exclude structural disease. Identifying the specific diagnosis (eg, differentiating between functional abdominal pain and irritable bowel syndrome) and establishing an effective patient-physician relationship are the cornerstones of therapy. Many patients with mild symptoms can be effectively managed with limited tests, sensible dietary modifications, and over-the-counter medications tailored to symptoms. If these measures are not sufficient, pharmacotherapy should be considered for bowel symptoms (constipation or diarrhea) and/or abdominal pain; opioids should not be used. Behavioral and psychological approaches (eg, cognitive behavioral therapy) can be helpful, particularly in patients with chronic abdominal pain who require a multidisciplinary pain management program without opioids.",

      "abstract": "Children with cerebral palsy and other neurodisabilities often have decreased postural control that exacerbates their feeding/swallowing disorders. Correct postural alignment is important in the normal feeding/swallowing process. In the child with cerebral palsy, the alignment and stability of the oral structures for feeding/swallowing may be compromised by abnormal muscle tone and movement patterns. Effective oral functioning for feeding begins with attaining better head stability to improve jaw control. Head control is influenced by trunk alignment, which depends upon the stability of the pelvic area. Techniques such as therapeutic seating and oral control can enhance postural alignment and improve oral functioning for the safe intake of food.",

      "title": "Mechanisms in IBS: something old, something new, something borrowed…",
      "abstract": "The objectives are to briefly review the 'classical' (old) pathophysiology and mechanisms1 in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), to address the current understanding2 of the role of inflammation in IBS (borrowed), and to evaluate the potential of novel mechanisms: serotonin, genetics and intraluminal factors. The pivotal mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of IBS are altered psychosocial function, motility and hypersensitivity. The psychosocial aspects are well reviewed elsewhere1 and, in summary, they are important determinants of the emotional response to visceral stimulation, influence the time of presentation to physicians and severity of disease, and may potentially be treated with antidepressants and other behavioural approaches. Important motor dysfunctions also have been summarized elsewhere3 and include prominent symptoms and colonic contractions after feeding in diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (D-IBS)4,5 and poor colonic response in constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (C-IBS) or functional constipation associated with slow transit.6 Disturbances of transit profiles reflect the predominant bowel dysfunction,7–9 and gas transit is also demonstrable experimentally and is related to bloating sensation.10,11 Associated evacuation disorder (e.g. puborectalis spasm) may result in an overlap with symptoms of C-IBS.12,13 Epidemiological studies document overlap with upper functional disease, specifically dyspepsia or upper abdominal pain, which occurred in 80% of IBS patients in one study.14 Overlap of IBS with celiac disease may merely reflect the concurrence of two relatively common disorders in the same person and the limited symptomatic manifestations of diverse gut disorders. Clearly, screening for celiac disease is important in susceptible populations, although recent population-based studies suggest that serological screening does not identify significant numbers of celiac disease patients among people with IBS and dyspepsia in a community with a predominant Northern European extraction.15 Visceral hypersensitivity and hyperalgesia are well documented in IBS,16–21 and the rectal sensory threshold for pain of 32 mmHg has relatively high sensitivity and specificity for identifying hypersensitivity. The increased activation of the limbic or emotional motor system in IBS patients during rectal distension has been confirmed in several studies.22,23 There are several lines of evidence to address this question. First, epidemiological studies suggest an association between inflammation following prior infection and the persistence of IBS symptoms. This literature is well reviewed elsewhere.1 The interdependence of prior infection and psychological status has also been consistently documented,1 and this may question the role of persistent inflammation as an independent risk factor. Alternatively, the data are interpreted as evidence of the importance of psychoneuroimmune interactions; it is then unclear whether the inflammation is a key common final pathway to non-specific psychological influence on gut function, and the prior infection potentially unrelated other than as an initiator of the cascade of events. However, a summary of the epidemiology data also shows that the prevalence of postinfectious IBS (p1-IBS) is no more prevalent than IBS in the general population. A second approach is to review the quantitative differences in the inflammation and their association with symptoms. Several studies have documented increased numbers of CD3, CD25 or mast cells in ileal, colonic or rectal biopsies,24–31 but the differences for lymphocyte counts between controls and IBS are small, with predominant overlaps in the counts between the two conditions; a few outliers seem to be exceptions, and it is unclear whether these higher immune cell counts have functional significance, e.g. influence sensitivity or permeability. Differences in mast cell numbers27–31 appear to be more substantial and consistent, and there is now evidence that there are functional correlates in the significant association between mast cells in close proximity to nerves and severity and frequency of abdominal pain.31 Nevertheless, it is significant that only one of five markers of mast cell morphology was associated with IBS, the sample size was small, and the correlation is influenced by the fact that three of 13 IBS patients had no pain (questioning whether they indeed had IBS using current criteria). The third line of evidence to be examined is the response of IBS to anti-inflammatory treatment. A controlled trial has shown that, among carefully selected patients with postinfectious IBS, prednisone 30 mg b.i.d. was not significantly better than placebo and that, while placebo resulted in the customary, significant 30% change in median symptom score relative to baseline, no change in score was noted in the prednisone treatment group.32 In this section, the following themes will be reviewed: IBS as a 'serotonin disease' and the role of serotonin transporter the role of genetics and IBS, and the concept of the 'irritated bowel'. Aficionados have claimed that IBS is a disorder of serotonin. This is partly influenced by the recent evidence that modulation of serotonergic mechanisms significantly impacts the manifestations of IBS. In some respects, this is also a borrowed concept since serotonin is a key player in the secretion and dysmotility of the carcinoid syndrome,33 in which 5-HT3 antagonists reduce the colonic response to feeding34, diarrhoea and the need for rescue antidiarrhoeal agents.35 There are other more direct lines of evidence to address the potential role of serotonin. First, plasma 5-HT levels are elevated in patients with IBS.36,37 Postmeal symptoms can be prominent in IBS patients,37,38 and Houghton attempted to correlate postprandial symptoms and increase in plasma 5-HT.37 However, it appears that the peak in plasma 5-HT levels does not match with the time (first 60–90 min) when patients typically experience pain, diarrhoea and urgency in IBS.39 Second, enteroendocrine cells in rectal biopsies of PI-IBS patients24,25,27 show significantly increased numbers of 5-HT containing cells; these quantitative differences were more impressive in one study24 than a subsequent study from Spiller's group,25 and overlap with numbers in disease control groups, or non-PI-IBS suggests that prior infection may not be a key factor. A third line of evidence that comprehensively assessed several factors involved in the control of 5-HT in IBS involved mucosal biopsies from IBS, healthy and disease controls (ulcerative colitis). Thus, Coates et al.40 showed that the number of enteroendoerine E cells containing 5-HT was normal, in contrast to other studies,25–27 and the release of 5-HT from mucosal biopsies under baseline conditions or in response to stimulation was normal. However, the mucosal content of the 5-HT re-uptake protein, SERT, was reduced as shown by SERT mRNA content and immunohistochemistry. These changes paralleled the findings in non-severe ulcerative colitis, and it is unlikely that the diarrhoea itself may have induced the changes since results were similar in D-IBS and C-IBS. The mechanisms causing these changes and their functional importance remain the subject of continued research. Certainly, differences in SERT function appear to influence the response to therapy in IBS41 and further studies are awaited. Fourth, serotonergic agents are effective in the treatment of multiple symptoms of IBS, including 5-HT3 antagonists42 and 5-HT4 agonists.43 Three lines of evidence suggest there may be a role for genetics, but the data are certainly not conclusive at present. First, familial aggregation studies suggest that family members of IBS patients are more likely to suffer from IBS than their spouse controls.44,45 Second, twin studies also document a difference between risk of IBS in monozygotic relative to dizygotic twins;46,47 however, the fact that mothers of mono- and dizygotic twins have similar prevalence of IBS suggests that heredity and social learning or other environmental factors interact as risk factors in development of IBS. Third, genetic epidemiology studies start to provide some evidence of a genetic association in IBS. However, these data are to be viewed as preliminary and the pitfalls of such association studies, which may be underpowered, should be kept in mind in reviewing these data. Fewer IBS patients have high IL-10 producer (G/G) genotype than controls.48 The potential functional significance is that these patients do not down-regulate inflammation, which may be a factor in the development of IBS. Holtmann et al. have shown that a polymorphism in the gene for the G protein involved in mediating the effects of several neurotransmitters and hormones, GNβ3 C825T genotype, is significantly associated with the report of dyspepsia and to a lesser extent in IBS patients presenting to a clinic in Germany.49 Adrenergic and serotonergic genotypes were investigated in 276 IBS patients and 120 community controls. A 44 bp deletion in the gene for the promoter for SERT (SERT-P) has been previously shown to influence the function of the SERT protein produced. Thus, the wild type l/l polymorphism results in normal function, whereas the presence of the short allele (s/l or s/s) results in impaired function.50 In 90 C-IBS patients of 274 IBS patients and 120 controls, Kim et al.51 showed a significant association with α2A adrenoceptor polymorphism, and the combination of the α2 adrenoceptor and SERT-P polymorphism was associated with high somatic scores in patients with lower functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs). SERT-P alone was not a risk factor for D-IBS in the Mayo Clinic study,51 and a summary of studies to date suggests there is no significant association with IBS or its subtypes51–54 in studies from North America and Korea. A positive association with D-IBS in Turkey55 needs to be viewed with caution, given the ethnic differences in the genetic distribution of the polymorphism and the small sample studied (n = 18). In summary, the reduced mucosal SERT in C-IBS and D-IBS observed by Coates et al.40 does not appear to be genetically determined, based on reports in the literature to date. In this section, the 'old' concept of the irritated bowel will be addressed because recent data suggest that changes in the intraluminal milieu may result in symptoms which may be restored by treatments directed to the intraluminal factors. There is overlap in symptoms between idiopathic bile acid catharsis, or rapid ideal transit that results in failure of bile acid absorption. Merrick et al.56 used bile salt retention to demonstrate that patients with functional diarrhoea that may or may not be associated with pain may have evidence of bile acid malabsorption. Patients with IBS show higher intestinal secretion in response to perfused bile acids in the ileum, relative to controls.57 Malaguti et al. showed that retarding transit with loperamide reduces the risk of bile salt loss.58 It is not surprising therefore that bile salt binding with cholestyramine may be effective in the treatment of IBS with diarrhoea. Perfusion of the mammalian or human colon with di-α hydroxybile acids such as chenodeoxycholic acid or short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) results in high amplitude propagated contractions or rapid transit in healthy colon.59–63 Studies have not been conducted in IBS patients. However, the relatively low concentrations of bile acid (1 mmol L−1) required to induce highly propulsive propagated sequences suggest that relatively modest levels of malabsorption may be sufficient to perturb colonic motility. The concentrations of long chain fatty acids (e.g. oleic acid) needed to accelerate colon transit are relatively high, but certainly would be in the range associated with moderate fat malabsorption.59 Such colonic concentrations of longer chain fatty acids are unlikely to be achieved in patients with IBS, although formal studies with long and short chain fatty acids are required. Does a change in intraluminal milieu or bacterial ecology in the intestine improve bowel function and symptoms in IBS? Small studies suggest that probiotics or antibiotics aimed at changing bacterial counts may indeed alter symptoms, although the mechanism is still unclear. Nobaek et al. showed that alteration of intestinal microflora by feeding probiotics was associated with reduction in abdominal bloating and pain in patients with IBS.64 Similarly, Kim et al. showed that, in patients with IBS, the combination probiotic, VSL no. 3, resulted in improvement of the symptom of bloating, but no other symptoms or global relief or change in small bowel or colonic transit were observed relative to placebo treatment.65 Quigley et al. have preliminarily reported that there is benefit with bifidobacteria, not with lactobacillus containing probiotics.66 Finally, change in the bacterial ecology with the non-absorbable antibiotic, neomycin, results in short-term improvement in the composite score for IBS and bowel dysfunction.67 These effects were observed in a 7-day trial; interestingly, patients whose lactulose-hydrogen breath test normalized had greater improvement than those with no response in breath hydrogen. The authors' interpretation is that this represents an effect on bacterial overgrowth in the small bowel in IBS. While this interpretation may be questioned and longer-term studies and outcomes of treatment with bacterial modification need to be evaluated, these data are consistent with the concept that it is time to revisit the role of the intestinal milieu and the effects of bacteria and endogenous factors such as bile acids and fatty acids in the mechanisms and treatment of IBS. While there is increasing evidence that IBS represents an enteric neurological disorder that alters bowel sensation, secretion, and motility, it is important to continue to study inflammation and the potential for intraluminal factors resulting in dysregulation of those functions. Central mechanisms may enhance visceral sensation or the interpretation of ascending visceral signals as unpleasant because of the disturbances in the limbic system which is involved in the affective response to pain. At this time, the role of genetics is uncertain. These data suggest that therapies should continue to be directed at these pathophysiological mechanisms in the gut and central control; however, it is conceivable that further understanding of the bowel ecology in health and disease may open new avenues for treatment of IBS.

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Food desires are defined as motivations that drive the search for and consumption of food. However, when domains of intensity and urgency are activated, these desires can become intense (i.e. food craving), being then characterized by episodes or cognitive events loaded with affectivity, in which food is associated with obtaining pleasure or relief, which is the only attentional focus. Specificity and urgency mark the differentiation between food desires and cravings. The process of elaboration with vivid images, the retention in working memory, the emergence of a negative affect state (awareness of the lack), and a committed attentional focus to seek food are characterized as stages of an episode of food craving. Individuals with eating disorders have the lowest levels of food craving when it comes to anorexia nervosa and the subsequent increase to bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder. Some environmental and cultural triggers and internal factors of cognition and emotions play a crucial role in the emergence of food craving episodes. The external factors include positive/negative events, food environment, advertisements, cultural beliefs about food, specific locations, and food itself. The internal factors comprise dietary restriction, food reward, impulsivity/inflexibility, emotions, thoughts and feelings about food, hunger/satiety/appetite, and anxious/depressive symptoms. Treatment involves the association of flexibility, awareness, and questioning strategies about dietary practices based on three principles: unconditional permission to eat, eating more for physical than emotional reasons, and tuning in with the body’s signs of hunger and satiety (intuitive eating).",

Retnikov1, V. Hernandez1, A. Cabrera1, A. González1, C. Giménez1 and V. Felipo1 1 Centro de Investigación Príncipe Felipe, Laboratory of Neurobiology, Spain Patients with liver diseases (e.g. cirrhosis) may present hepatic encephalopathy (HE), an alteration in cerebral function which is a consequence of failure of liver function. Patients with HE may present different neurological alterations, as impairment of cognitive or motor functions or altered sleep-wake cycle, which impairs their quality of live. Hyperammonemia is considered a main contributor to the neurological alterations in HE. Animal models of chronic HE (e.g. rats with portacaval shunts) or of ‘‘pure’’ hyperammonemia reproduce some of these impaired cerebral functions. Both hyperammonemia and neuroinflammation contribute to the impairment of cognitive and motor functions. We have found a good correlation between the learning ability and the function of the glutamate-nitric oxide-cGMP pathway in rat cerebellum in vivo. Treatment of rats with chronic HE or hyperammonemia by means of inhibitors of phosphodiesterase 5 (that increase levels of cGMP) restores the function of the glutamate-nitric oxide-cGMP pathway in cerebellum as well as the learning ability. The same beneficial effects may be obtained by treating the rats chronically with an anti-inflammatory compound, ibuprofen. Ibuprofen also improves the hypokinesia in rats with portacaval shunts. Hyperammonemic rats also show altered circadian rhythms of activity due to the impairment of the circadian variation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis. Mechanisms involved in the effects of hyperammonemia and inflammation include alteration in glutamatergic and GABAergic neurotransmission in cerebellum and basal ganglia. The study of these mechanisms in animal models of HE will allow the development of new and more efficient therapeutic strategies: for example, the increase of cGMP levels or anti-inflammatory molecules to improve learning and memory performance in individuals with HE.

      "abstract": "Abstract In previously conscious patients seizures are usually easily detected. Critically-ill patients are frequently sedated and a proportion are paralysed with neuromuscular blocking agents, in such patients it may be hard or impossible to detect seizures clinically. An urgent electroencephalogram (EEG) should be obtained whenever seizures are witness or suspected, especially if the patient does not rapidly return to baseline, when non-convulsive status epilepticus must be excluded. Unless the cause of the seizure activity is already known, an urgent CT, or MRI is indicated. If central nervous system infection is suspected a lumbar puncture may be needed. Status epilepticus is diagnosed when there is recurrent or continued seizure activity without intervening recovery. Most seizures are self-limiting and stop after 1–2 minutes, seizures that continue for more than 5 minutes should be treated. Treatment priorities for any seizure are to stop the patient hurting either themselves or anyone else. General supportive measures include attention to the airway, breathing, circulation, exclusion of hypoglycaemia and an EEG to exclude non-convulsive status epilepticus. A variety of drugs can be used to terminate seizures; parenteral benzodiazepines are the most commonly used agents although propofol and barbiturates are alternatives. Emergent endotracheal intubation may well be necessary, hypotension can be expected and may need treatment with intravenous fluids and vasopressors.",

The interviewer should inquire whether the child experiences repeated, severe anger or temper outbursts that are either verbal (verbal rages) or involve physical aggression towards other people or things and for no good reason. The interviewer should also ask the parent whether these outbursts are unexpected or unusual, given their child's age. To meet the diagnostic criteria for Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder, the temper outbursts and disruptive mood must occur on average three or more times per week, and must be constant for 12 months or more, without a period of 3 months of normal mood. Moreover, the temper outbursts and disruptive mood must have started before age 10, but not before age 6.",

The first problem is to separate those suffering from a disturbance which may be relieved entirely, or in part, by an intelligent therapeutic regime, from those in whom such an effort would be wasted. In the past it has been customary to depend upon casual observation as the deciding factor and many times this is sufficient. If, however, one uses bone development as an index of metabolic speed, irrespective of the other findings, he gets an entirely new viewpoint of the subject. Proceeding in this manner, it will be discovered that all mentally defective or emotionally unstable children fall into three main groups, i.e. (1) those having normal bone development; (2) those having definitely retarded bone development, and (3) those having definitely advanced bone development. 1 shall limit this discussion to the first two classes; maerogenitosomia and other vague conditions producing abnormally rapid development are beyond the scope of this paper. I am of the opinion that any metabolic disorder in childhood, when sufficiently severe to produce mental or emotional symptoms, will be reflected in the bone development. The first group then may be excluded.",

Mais la semiologie critique des autres mouvements buccaux est souvent plus difficile a decrire et a interpreter. Nous rapportons le cas d'une patiente de 38 ans, gauchere, dont les crises se manifestent essentiellement par des mouvements buccaux difficiles a caracteriser (ni un mâchonnement, ni un pourlechage, ni un phenomene moteur elementaire) qui evoquent des dyskinesies bucco-faciales. Elle a presente une meningite a l'âge de 7 mois, des crises d'allure generalisee a 9 ans, puis des crises partielles pluri-quotidiennes depuis l'âge de 24 ans. Ces crises debutent par une sensation de blocage dans la gorge avec blocage du langage, suivie d'une crispation des paupieres, inconstamment des membres superieurs et de mouvements buccaux. L'examen neurologique et les electro-encephalogrammes inter-critiques sont normaux. Les EEG critiques montrent une decharge rapide initiale fronto-centrale gauche. Une origine insulo-operculaire ou proche de l'aire motrice supplementaire a ete evoquee, d'autant que l'imagerie par resonance magnetique encephalique revele un hypersignal dans cette region a gauche.

Ces deux dernieres regions sont le siege d'une activite lesionnelle et irritative. Les crises admettent le meme debut. La stimulation electrique de l'insula anterieure provoque une sensation de gorge serree alors que celle de la region lesionnelle declenche une crise electro-clinique. Les mouvements buccaux complexes de notre patiente apparaissent quand il existe une mise en jeu bipolaire, impliquant simultanement l'AMS et l'opercule precentral.

      "title": "Evidence and perspectives in eating disorders: a paradigm for a multidisciplinary approach",
      "abstract": "The WPA Section on Eating Disorders is primarily concerned with the prevention of these disorders, the assessment of their psychopathology and psychiatric and physical comorbidities, the identification of pathways to specialist care, the organization of integrated multidisciplinary approaches to their management, and the promotion of information on evidence-based treatments and strategies to support caregivers and to facilitate treatment adherence and effectiveness. Eating disorders are complex mental diseases growing on a psychopathological core, i.e. the overconcern with body weight and shape in determining self-esteem, as recently confirmed through network analyses1. This psychopathological core also includes maladaptive perfectionism, impulsive traits, dysfunctional emotion regulation strategies, and social cognitive deficits, which lead to a number of abnormal behaviors ranging from extreme diet restriction to uncontrolled overeating with or without purging, vomiting and laxative or diuretic misuse, as well as excessive exercising. Anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa and binge eating disorder are the most well-known eating disorders, although other disorders have been included in the DSM-5. Eating disorder types differ in terms of lifetime prevalence and age at onset, but the peak age at onset of both threshold and subthreshold anorexia and bulimia nervosa occurs during adolescence. In this period, eating disorders are recognized as being the third most common chronic illness2. Moreover, they often co-occur with other psychiatric disorders, particularly anxiety and depression, over the lifespan. Hence, they have a considerable impact on personal, family, working and social life. On the other hand, treatment may promote recovery in 40-50% of adult people and higher percentages of adolescents3. Eating disorders are marked by a high rate of physical comorbidity4, with anorexia nervosa reaching the highest mortality rate of all mental disorders. This highlights the need for multiple levels of treatment, including outpatient facilities as well as rehabilitation and hospital units, depending on the severity of the clinical picture. In addition, a multidisciplinary approach, which includes access to physical, nutritional, psychological and psychiatric interventions, is recommended in order to achieve full recovery5. Psychiatrists with adequate training and expertise are in the best position to build links with general practice, medical/emergency wards, mental health settings and specialist services. They play a key role in coordinating other clinicians in both diagnosis and treatment processes. Unfortunately, the current access rate to specialized services is unsatisfactory. Possible reasons for this are the complexity of the pathways to care and the patients' ambivalence towards change or denial of their illness, but also some deficiencies in the transition between adolescent and adult mental health care. The relevance of this issue is higher in eating disorders than in other mental diseases, as there is evidence that early intervention, i.e. in the first three years, yields more favorable outcomes6. Trained mental health professionals are essential in addressing these problems through the promotion of educational programs for health care practitioners, which may facilitate knowledge and identification of the disorders, and through support to patients in their therapeutic engagement. For the latter purpose, offering shared decision-making and creating supportive environments may be particularly effective. The application of evidence-based treatments for these disorders is a critical area that needs to be pursued7, but therapeutic alliance has been identified as a non-specific therapeutic factor that significantly contributes to promoting recovery8. The relevance of family involvement is unquestioned, especially in adolescents. Family members are important in identifying the disorder and facilitating access to specialist care, particularly in youth. Hence, it is essential that psychiatrists provide them with appropriate support and information, reducing the fear and stigma associated with eating disorders. Furthermore, there is a need to promote prevention programs such as school-based interventions and e-health projects, although the settings and the means of delivery need to be further explored. In accordance with the staging model of eating disorders6, the persistence of the illness is associated with neurofunctional changes (especially with respect to reward learning habits) and social exclusion, which may contribute to the disorder evolving into a severe and enduring stage. These processes, as well as variables such as body mass index, binge-purging behaviors, interpersonal functioning, psychiatric comorbidities, family problems and motivation to recovery, need to be taken into account by psychiatrists and specialized mental health professionals in order to tailor treatment to the individual patient9. Although treatment guidelines provide specific parameters to assess the level of medical risk and hospital admission requirements, psychiatrists are advised to consider the current definition of eating disorder severity still in development. The WPA Section on Eating Disorders was founded in 2002 and includes 172 members. It organizes symposia and section meetings at WPA conferences in order to provide a multidisciplinary discussion of the most relevant research topics and clinical advances in the field. It also promotes research activities aimed to assess differences among countries in pathways to specialist care, choice of specialist treatments and organization of inpatient and outpatient facilities. The Section aims to disseminate knowledge on the clinical management of eating disorders among psychiatrists as well as psychologists, other specialist physicians, general practitioners and nurses, highlighting the crucial role that psychiatrists must play in the multidisciplinary approach to these complex mental disorders.",

Although most of such complaints can be attributed to the changes in the sleep architecture as we grow old, primary sleep disorders are more prevalent in elderly [2]. Poor sleep due to these disorders results in increased risk of significant morbidity and mortality. As we age, sleep efficiency decreases as time spent in bed increases. Underlying sleep disorders are aggravated due to a decrease in the ability to get needed sleep. However, the decreased ability is less a function of age and more a function of other factors that accompany aging, such as medical and psychiatric illness, increased medication use, advances in the endogenous circadian clock and a higher prevalence of specific sleep disorders.",

Insomnia was significantly associated with working night shifts among Norwegian nurses [1]. Individual factors that are associated with insomnia among permanent night workers are older age, lower circadian adjustments, being married, having children, physical inactivity and excessive intake of caffeine [2].

      "abstract": "Normal gastric motor function requires coordination of the autonomic nervous system, neurotransmitters and enteric smooth muscle cells. Alterations at any level of these complex processes may result in gastric motility disorders. Gastric motility disorders are common in children, and their treatment is often daunting. This chapter provides a detailed insight into the etiologies and pathogenesis of gastric motility disorders and an overview of the treatment modalities. Various etiologies account for the numerous clinical sequelae associated with gastric dysmotility, along with poorly understood and complex pathophysiological mechanisms. Etiological factors associated with gastroparesis vary with the child's age. Gastric electrical and motor activity matures with gestational age. Early life experiences including environmental and nociceptive factors may delay postnatal gastro-enteric motor maturation. Post-infectious gastroparesis is common in children. It is often transient and resolves completely over several months. Neural disorders such as peripheral neuropathies, Hirschsprung's disease, and various CNS disorders including mitochondrial encephalopathies are associated with gastroparesis. Gastroparesis seen after thoracic and upper abdominal surgeries can be due to injury of the vagal nerve. Inflammatory myopathies such as polymyositis and dermatomyositis frequently present with slow gastric emptying. Gastroparesis is seen in common gastroenterological conditions such as cow milk protein allergy, celiac disease, and inflammatory bowel diseases. Patients with various endocrine disorders, caustic ingestions and those who are critically ill commonly present with delayed gastric emptying. Rapid gastric emptying can lead to dumping syndrome characterized by the onset of gastrointestinal and vasomotor symptoms following the ingestion of a meal. Early dumping syndrome occurs as a consequence of the rapid emptying of hyperosmolar contents of the stomach into the small intestine, resulting in a fluid shift from the intravascular compartment into the intestinal lumen. Late dumping syndrome occurs due to reactive hypoglycemia from rapid release of insulin into circulation secondary to brisk absorption of glucose from the small bowel. Treatment of dumping syndrome includes lifestyle modifications and dietary measures.",

UG is characterized by features of Krodhanam (aggressiveness/impulsivity), Nishwasantam (hyperventilation/anxiety/phobia), Bhramantam (agitation/restlessness/hyperactivity), Trasyantam (startle response/hyperekplexia/anxiety/phobia), Raktaaksha (red eyes/Kayser–Fleischer rings), Stabdha drishtim (prolonged staring/abnormal eye movements), Jihwa lolayantam/Srikkinyau lihaan (facial tics), Sarpavat prasarati/Adhomukha shaayinam (athetosis/chorea/motor tics/opisthotonus), Chalam/Vakra gamanam (gait abnormalities), Ksheera, ghrita, guda, and madhu priyam (craving for sweets), Snaana maalya priyam (obsessive-compulsive features), Gaatraani kampayantam (tremors/motor tics/seizures), Dantai khaadantam (self-injurious behaviors/oromandibular dystonia/bruxism), Nidraalu (hypersomnia/excessive daytime sleepiness), etc.. The clinical picture of UG shows similarity with various \"extrapyramidal movement disorders\" and also with \"Tourette syndrome-plus.\"",

We find numerous examples among patients exhibiting low body weight and other anorexic-like symptomatology who, despite the presence of a definite eating disorder, fail to meet formal criteria for anorexia nervosa. We report five cases of this type, reviewing common features as a basis for proposing a subtype of Atypical Eating Disorders that has specific symptomatology and psychological characteristics, that can presently not be defined as either an anorexic or bulimic disorder. We offer speculations as to a possibly distinct etiology of such atypical eating disorders.",

The patient had a background of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, but had been in complete remission for 4 years at the time of diagnosis. This case is highly unusual not only in terms of the mode of clinical presentation in an apparently immunocompetent patient but also in that the patient spontaneously improved without any intervention. Progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy should therefore be considered in the differential diagnosis of movement disorders developing in patients with a history of lymphoproliferative disease, even if they are in remission. Furthermore, such cases may not always require treatment, as the patient’s immune system may overcome the viral disease process with spontaneous resolution of their neurological disorder.",

      "title": "Clinical features of depressive states in eating disorders",
      "abstract": "Introduction Eating disorders (ED) are one of the most pressing problems of modern society. Eating disorders, due to their heterogeneity, can be considered both an independent form of mental disorders and as part of the manifestations of other mental illnesses. In the vast majority of cases within these pathologies, eating disorder coexists with depressive symptoms, which significantly worsens the prognosis of the disease. Objectives Identification of the association of depressive disorders with eating disorders to improve the criteria for nosological diagnosis, prognosis and therapeutic approaches. Methods A total of 74 patients aged from 15 to 25 years old (all female, average age 16.2), who were on outpatient and inpatient observation of the clinic were studied. Results The study made it possible to establish the characteristics of depressive disorders and the nature of the current course of depression associated with eating disorders. In eating disorders with a predominance of anorexia nervosa , the structure of depression was more dominated by the asthenia radical with symptoms of apathy, melancholia, anhedonia, irritability, episodes of anxiety after eating, and sleep disturbances. Patients noted a decrease in performance, mental activity, and a narrowing of their range of interests and communication. Depression became severe as exhaustion progressed. For eating disorders with bulimia nervosa . depressive states varied in the severity and polymorphism of their manifestations. Their structure was largely dominated by the apatho-adynamic radical of affect, along with asthenia and anxiety, which often reached the level of panic states. Often, along with this, there were pronounced a guilt feeling and low self-esteem ideas with self-deprecation and self-hatred, which led to the manifestation of auto-aggressive behavior (both non-suicidal and suicidal). Depression reached a severe degree as exhaustion progressed, as well as against the background of more frequent attacks of overeating and vomiting. Conclusions The identified associations between depressive disorders and eating disorders allow us to form a clearer picture of the expected course of psychiatric disease and optimize therapeutic intervention algorithms. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

      "abstract": "Unmada (a broad term which includes different psychiatric conditions under one umbrella) is characterized by the derangement of manas (mind), buddhi (cognitive functions), samgna gnana (orientation), smriti (memory), bhakti (interests), sheela (character/personality), cheshtha (psychomotor activity/behavior), and achara (conduct). Unmada is classified into five (vataja, pittaja, kaphaja, sannipataja and agantuja) types, and \"Vataja Unmada\" (VU) is one among them. The description of VU is available in all major Ayurvedic classical texts, and it comes under \"Doshaja\" (psychiatric disorder which occurs due to the aggravation of doshas) category. Studies or scientific literature on VU has been lacking, and the present work is focused on to explore this condition. The etiopathology of VU denotes deficiency of various nutritional factors such as vitamins, minerals, omega-3-fatty acids, amino acids, and antioxidants. Lacking or deficiency of these nutritional factors leads to structural and/or functional damage and degeneration of the brain (neurodegenerative or demyelinating pathology) which ultimately leads to the manifestation of different degenerative psychiatric disorders. The clinical picture of VU resembles various psychiatric or neuropsychiatric conditions such as \"disorganized schizophrenia\" or \"hebephrenia\" or \"catatonia\" or \"dementia\" or \"bipolar disorder with psychotic features\" or \"mania with psychotic features,\" or \"organic or secondary psychoses.\" VU is a treatable condition, and it can be managed successfully by \"Panchakarma\" procedures along with internal medicines.",

Cependant, chez l’adulte où il persiste une croissance résiduelle, la dimension verticale d’occlusion (DVO) augmente légèrement. La posture de repos mandibulaire est le fait de facteurs physiques (viscoélasticité des tissus attenants à la mandibule, espace de Donders) et de contrôles moteurs. L’activité tonique de repos des muscles masticateurs d’origine centrale est modulée par des influx d’origine périphérique et centrale. La posture de repos varie avec le type facial, le type de respiration (buccale/nasale) et l’augmentation de la DVO. La DVO est finement contrôlée par le système trigéminal, cependant une certaine plasticité des circuits trigéminaux rend possible son augmentation. Cliniquement l’augmentation ou la diminution de la DVO n’est pas responsable de dysfonctionnements de l’appareil manducateur (DAM). Si l’occlusion n’est plus reconnue comme étant responsable de DAM, certains patients présenteraient néanmoins une certaine vulnérabilité provoquée par une modification de l’occlusion. Cette inadaptation serait due à des régulations sensorimotrices déficitaires et/ou à la plus forte prévalence du bruxisme de veille chez ces patients.",

Infiltration of the meninges and brain with leukemic cells is being recognized with increasing frequency. This serious complication can occur at any stage of the disease, even when the child is in good hematologic remission. It is more apt to occur later in the course of the disease, however(1). Because it is impossible to predict which child will develop central nervous system involvement, close observation of all leukemic children is most important. Everyone who cares for these youngsters-nurses and parents alike-must be alert to sudden changes in the child's condition and be prepared for any emergency. The child may convulse suddenly, occasionally without warning. The symptoms to watch for include persistent nausea and vomiting, severe headaches, weakness of the extremities, unexplained lethargy, episodic irritability, various neurological manifestations such as ataxia, vertigo, ocular palsies, tinnitus, and rarely, voracious appetite and weight gain (2). Papilledema is an early sign. An electroencephalogram will disclose abnormal changes. Intrathecal methotrexate has been successful in the treatment of meningeal complications, and large effective doses can be administered by this route(3,4) .

This results in periodic episodes of profound loss of motor tone while consciousness is preserved. Symptomatic cataplexy is rare, and the anatomical localization of the defect responsible for the syndrome is, to our knowledge, unknown.<sup>1</sup>It is also unusual to encounter cataplexy in the absence of narcolepsy. <h3>Report of a Case.—</h3> A 58-year-old man gave a six-year history of recurrent falls occurring about twice a month and usually precipitated by anger or laughter. He described the sudden onset of overwhelming weakness such that his legs gave way and he fell to the floor. Consciousness was preserved and the attacks lasted only a few minutes. There was no associated sleep disturbance. He had never been able to look fully either to left or right.",

      "title": "Primary Nocturnal Enuresis: A Review",
      "abstract": "Context: Nocturnal enuresis or bedwetting is the most common type of urinary incontinence in children. It has significant psychological effects on both the child and the family. Enuresis nocturna is defined as the inability to hold urine during the night in children who have completed toilet training. It is termed as being \"primary\" if no continence has ever been achieved or \"secondary if it follows at least 6 months of dry nights. The aim of this review was to assemble the pathophysiological background and general information about nocturnal enuresis. Evidence Acquisition: This review was performed by evaluating the literature on nocturnal enuresis published between 1970 and 2015, available via PubMed and using the keywords \"nocturnal enuresis,\" \"incontinence,\" \"pediatric,\" \"review,\" and \"treatment.\" Results: Children with nocturnal enuresis produce urine at higher rates during the night, and may have lower bladder capacities. Some children with nocturnal enuresis may also have daytime urgency, frequency, and urinary incontinence. Treatment includes aggressive treatment of accompanying constipation or urinary tract infections, behavioral changes, and medical therapy. Alarm therapy remains the first-line treatment modality for primary nocturnal enuresis. High rates of patient compliance and relapse mean that alternative treatments remain on the agenda. Conclusions: Nocturnal enuresis is a common problem that has multifaceted effects on both the child and the family. Due to multiple etiologic factors, nocturnal enuresis is still not clearly defined.",

      "title": "Is Maturation Delay a Frequent Factor in the Origins of Primary Nocturnal Enuresis?",
      "abstract": "SUMMARY It is commonly stated that nocturnal enuresis is a developmental disorder. This may be a statement that, in bladder control, behaviour is typical of a younger age or it may be a statement that there is delay in maturation of the necessary neuro‐muscular mechanisms. Maturation is inherent and genetically determined and is not susceptible to acceleration. Evidence is adduced that in 981/2 per cent of ordinaiy children, maturation has occurred by the age of five. Enuresis may be due to anxiety, often tiansient, during the thiId year of life which is apparently not only a ‘sensitive’ period for the emergence of nocturnal bladder control but also a ‘vulnerable’ period in which stresses often interfere with emergence of this behaviour. RÉSUMÉ Le délai de maturation est‐il une cause fréquente de 1'énurésie primaire ? On affirme communément que I'énurésie nocturne est un trouble du développement. Il peut s'agir d'une affirmation qui en terme de contrôle vésical traduit que le comportement correspond à un enfant plus jeune; cette affirmation peut aussi indiquer un délai de maturation dans les mécanismes neuromusculaires nécessaires. La maturation est indé‐pendante, déterminée génétiquement et non susceptible d'accélération. L'observation montre que chez 981/2 pour cent des enfants normaux, la maturation est atteinte à 1'âge de 5 ans. L'énurésie peut être due à une anxiété souvent temporaire, survenant durant la troisième année de la vie; celle‐ci est apparemment non seulement une période ‘sensible’ pour I'apparition du contrôle vésical nocturne mais aussi une période vulnérable durant laquelle les agressions peuvent interférer avec la mise en place de ce comportement vésical. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Ist eine Entwicklungsverzögerung ein häufiger Faktor bei der Entstehung der primären nächtlichen Enuresis ? Es wird allgemein vertreten, daß die nächtliche Enuresis eine Entwicklungsstörung ist. Dies kann bedeuten, daß das Verhalten bezüglich der Blasenkontrolle einem jüngeren Alter entspricht oder daß eine Verzögerung in der Reifung des erforderlichen neuro‐muskulären Systems vorliegt. Die Reifung ist angeboren und genetisch festgelegt und 1äßt sich nicht beschleunigen. Es ist enviesen, daß in 981/2 Prozent der normalen Kinder die Reifung bis zum Alter von fünf Jahren erfolgt ist. Enuresis tritt—häufig vorübergehend—als Folge von Angst während des dritten Lebensjahres auf, das offensichtlich nicht nur eine ‘sensitive’ Zeitspanne für die Ausbildung der nächtlichen Blasenkontrolle ist, sondern auch eine ‘verwundbare’ Zeitspanne, in der oft Stressituationen die Ausbildung dieses Verhaltens stören. RESUMEN Constituye el retraso madurativo un factor frecuente en los orígenes de la enuresis nocturna primaria ? Se admite corrientemente que la enuresis nocturna es una alteración del desarrollo. Esta afirmación puede significar que en el control vesical, el comportamiento es típico de una edad más joven o bien que existe un retraso en la maduración de los mecanismos neuro‐musculares necesarios. La maduración es inherente y determinada genéticamente y no es susceptible de aceleración. Hay evidencia aducida de que en el 98, 5 por ciento de los niños normales la maduración ha tenido lugar hacia la edad de 5 años. La enuresis puede ser debida a ansiedad, a menudo transitoria, durante el 3er. año de la vida, que aparentemente no sólo es un período ‘sensitivo’ para la emergencia del control vesical nocturno, sino tembién un período ‘vulnerable’ en el cual los ‘stresses’ interfieren a menudo con la emergencia de este comportamiento.",

Pills and capsules may also release their contents after a time lag, or a little at a time, or in some other predetermined way; these are time-release formulations. Many drugs in psychiatry have been time-release formulated to reduce their local adverse effects in the gastrointestinal tract, to reduce adverse effects associated with peak blood levels, or to artificially extend their half-life. Time-release formulations are associated with the added advantages of convenience of dosing, improved compliance, and less fluctuation in blood levels across the course of the day. A disadvantage of time-release formulations is that they may be incompletely absorbed; this is a serious issue in patients with acute or chronic intestinal hurry disorders, such as gastroenteritis or irritable bowel syndrome. Time-release formulations may also be more expensive than immediate-release formulations.

Children with these conditions may experience problems in their adaptation to school and impediments to their learning. However, many of the learning problems attributed to these conditions have been overstated. Neither asthma nor allergies directly alter brain development or neuropsychological functioning. Anoxia, secondary to respiratory arrest, occurs only rarely. Medications used to treat asthma and allergic conditions may occasionally impact children's ability to learn, although, for the most part, their effects are minimal. Similarly, the effects of chronic ear infections or of school absence are typically reversible when asthma and allergies become well-managed. More significant effects on children's concentration and learning occur because of the sleep loss and general malaise that accompany these conditions. Reasonable efforts to provide at-home work for children during prolonged absences and to provide some catch-up support upon return to the classroom should, in most cases, be sufficient to allow children with these chronic illnesses to maintain their pace with classmates.",

It is unclear whether children that develop the syndrome had entirely normal cognitive skills before seizure onset, since subtle impairment easily escapes recognition in small infants. It is also difficult to demonstrate whether a recognisable profile of cognitive impairment or a definite behavioural phenotype exists. No clear‐cut imaging or neuropathological marker or substrate has been recognised for cognitive impairment in this syndrome. However, there are different potentially causative factors, including the specific effects on the Nav1.1 channels caused by the underlying genic or genomic defect; frequent and prolonged convulsive and non‐convulsive seizures or status epilepticus; recurrent subtle ictal phenomena, such as that accompanying pronounced visual sensitivity; the use of antiepileptic drugs with cognitive side effects, especially in heavy multiple‐drug therapy; and the restrictions that children with severe epilepsy inevitably undergo.",

      "abstract": "Hunger und andere Formen der Mangelernahrung konnen verschiedene Konsequenzen fur den Organismus nach sich ziehen, wie zum Beispiel eine Herzinsuffizienz, eine Fettleber, Formen der Protein-Energie-Malnutrition wie Kwashiorkor und Marasmus und schlimmstenfalls den Tod. Bisher weniger grundlich untersucht sind die Folgen extremer Unterernahrung fur die Psyche. Menschen, die unter Hunger leiden, wirken antriebs- und kraftlos und lethargisch. Man konnte vermuten, dass sie depressiv sind. Aber erfullen sie wirklich die Diagnosekriterien einer klinischen Depression? Die Beantwortung dieser Frage konnte wichtige Hinweise darauf bergen, welche langfristigen Konsequenzen etwa auf eine Hungersnot oder ein weiteres Ansteigen der Pravalenz der Anorexia Nervosa folgen konnten. Dies konnte sowohl relevant fur die Arbeit von Arzten, Oecotrophologen, Psychologen und anderen therapeutischen Berufsgruppen sein als auch, auf einer globalen Ebene, bedeutsame Informationen fur die okonomischen Folgen beinhalten, die auf eine von Mangelernahrung betroffene Gesellschaft zukommen. So konnte eine durch Hunger induzierte erhohte Depressionspravalenz weitere Kosten fur das wahrscheinlich ohnehin gebeutelte Gesundheitssystem eines betroffenen Staats nach sich ziehen. Zudem ist es fur Menschen, die zusatzlich zu den korperlichen Entbehrungen des Hungers unter Symptomen der Antriebslosigkeit, Hoffnungslosigkeit, Interesse- und Freudlosigkeit leiden, um einiges schwerer, Kraft und Motivation fur den Wiederaufbau eines Landes zu finden. Die vorliegende Arbeit beschaftigt sich daher damit, ob Mangelernahrung zum Entstehen einer Depression fuhrt und welcher Art die gefundenen Symptome sind. Mangelernahrung ist ein weltweit verbreitetes Phanomen, das verschiedene Ursachen haben kann. Wahrend Hunger ein groses Problem in armeren Landern darstellt, entwickeln vor allem in den industrialisierten Landern immer mehr Menschen Essstorungen. Die in dieser Arbeit formulierten Hypothesen wurden anhand einer Zusammenfassung der Literatur und der wichtigsten Studien uberpruft. Es wurde gefunden, dass Mangelernahrung nicht zu einer klinisch diagnostizierbaren Depression, aber dennoch zu ausgepragten depressiven Symptomen fuhrt, die sich nach einer Normalisierung der Nahrungsaufnahme zuruckbilden. Diese Auswirkungen beschranken sich nicht auf einen somatischen Symptombereich, sondern finden sich ebenso in psychischen und kognitiven Gebieten. Weitere insbesondere experimentelle Forschungsarbeiten zur Kontrolle dieser Ergebnisse waren wertvoll fur die Weiterentwicklung des Verstandnisses der Interaktion von Mangelernahrung und Symptomen psychischer Erkrankungen.",

Les formes pédiatriques de SDRC 1 se distinguent des formes adultes : les douleurs sont majoritairement localisées aux membres inférieurs (cheville, pied) et surviennent après un traumatisme mineur. Les enfants se présentent le plus souvent avec une forme froide d’emblée. Les douleurs entraînent une impotence fonctionnelle majeure et prolongée, ce qui contraste avec l’absence ou la banalité de la lésion sous-jacente.

Le traitement repose sur une réhabilitation fonctionnelle grâce à la physiothérapie associée à une prise en charge psychothérapeutique. L’objectif est de remobiliser le membre douloureux de manière progressive et adaptée, sans attendre la sédation complète de la douleur, et de limiter les retentissements de la douleur au quotidien. Les antalgiques peuvent parfois être utiles, mais doivent être surveillés de manière étroite. Cette prise en charge est ambulatoire initialement, mais lorsque les douleurs sont trop intenses et entraînent des retentissements importants, une hospitalisation doit être proposée.

      "abstract": "Confusion and hallucinations in geriatric patients are frequent symptoms and typically associated with delirium, late-life psychosis or dementia syndromes. A far rarer but well-established differential in patients with rapid cognitive deterioration, acute psychosis, abnormal movements and seizures is autoimmune encephalitis. Exemplified by our case we highlight clinical and economic problems arising in management of geriatric patients with cognitive decline and psychotic symptoms.A 77-year-old female caucasian patient with an unremarkable medical history was hospitalized after a fall in association with diarrhea and hyponatremia. Upon adequate therapy, disorientation and troubled short-term memory persisted. Within a week the patient developed visual hallucinations. Basic blood and urine samples and imaging (cranial computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging) were unremarkable. With progressive cognitive decline, amnestic impairment, word finding difficulty and general apathy, psychiatric and neurologic expertise was introduced. Advanced diagnostics did not resolve a final diagnosis; an electroencephalogram showed unspecific generalized slowing. Extended clinical observation revealed visual hallucinations and faciobrachial dystonic seizures. A treatment with anticonvulsants was initiated. Cerebrospinal fluid ultimately tested positive for voltage-gated potassium channel LGl1 (leucine-rich-inactivated-1) antibodies confirming diagnosis of autoimmune anti-LGI1 encephalitis. Immediate immunotherapy (high-dose glucocorticoids and administration of intravenous immunoglobulin G) led to a rapid improvement of the patient's condition. After immunotherapy was tapered, the patient had one relapse and completely recovered with reintroduction of glucocorticoids and initiation of therapy with rituximab.Rapidly progressive dementia in geriatric patients demands a structured and multidisciplinary diagnostic approach. Accurate management and financially supportable care is a major issue in rare diseases such as anti-LGI1-encephalitis. Education and awareness about autoimmune encephalitis of all physicians treating a geriatric population is important in order to involve expertise and establish treatment within reasonable time.",

      "title": "Neuroleptics and operant behavior: The anhedonia hypothesis",
      "abstract": "Abstract Neuroleptic drugs disrupt the learning and performance of operant habits motivated by a variety of positive reinforcers, including food, water, brain stimulation, intravenous opiates, stimulants, and barbiturates. This disruption has been demonstrated in several kinds of experiments with doses that do not significantly limit normal response capacity. With continuous reinforcement neuroleptics gradually cause responding to cease, as in extinction or satiation. This pattern is not due to satiation, however, because it also occurs with nonsatiating reinforcement (such as saccharin or brain stimulation). Repeated tests with neuroleptics result in earlier and earlier response cessation reminiscent of the kind of decreased resistance to extinction caused by repeated tests without the expected reward. Indeed, withholding reward can have the same effect on responding under later neuroleptic treatment as prior experience with neuroleptics themselves; this suggests that there is a transfer of learning (really unlearning) from nonreward to neuroleptic conditions. These tests under continuous reinforcement schedules suggest that neuroleptics blunt the ability of reinforcers to sustain responding at doses which largely spare the ability of the animal to initiate responding. Animals trained under partial reinforcement, however, do not respond as well during neuroleptic testing as animals trained under continuous reinforcement. Thus, neuroleptics can also impair responding (though not response capacity ) that is normally sustained by environmental stimuli (and associated expectancies) in the absence of the primary reinforcer. Neuroleptics also blunt the euphoric impact of amphetamine in humans. These data suggest that the most subtle and interesting effect of neuroleptics is a selective attenuation of motivational arousal which is (a) critical for goal-directed behavior, (b) normally induced by reinforcers and associated environmental stimuli, and (c) normally accompanied by the subjective experience of pleasure. Because these drugs are used to treat schizophrenia and because they cause parkinsonian-like side effects, this action has implications for a better understanding of human pathology as well as normal motivational processes.",

      "abstract": "Zusammenfassung Die REM-Schlafverhaltensstörung (RBD) ist häufig das erste für den Betroffenen lebensbeeinträchtigende Symptom einer neurodegenerativen Erkrankung. Es konnte gezeigt werden, dass 81%–90% der Patienten mit einer RBD innerhalb von zehn Jahren eine Alpha-Synukleopathie (Morbus Parkinson, Lewy-Körperchen-Demenz, Multisystematrophie) entwickeln. Durch das Fehlen der normalerweise auftretenden Suppression der motorischen Aktivität während des REM-Schlafes, kommt es zum Ausagieren von Träumen. Die Diagnosesicherung erfolgt mittels Polysomnografie. Meist tritt die RBD zwischen dem 50. und 60. Lebensjahr erstmals auf. Männer sind wahrscheinlich häufiger betroffen als Frauen. Bei Patienten mit RBD fallen oft schon früh subtile Veränderungen wie Hyposmie, Obstipation oder Veränderungen der Motorik oder Kognition auf, die weitere Zeichen einer beginnenden neurodegenerativen Erkrankung sein können. Das gleichzeitige Auftreten der RBD bei bekannter, neurodegenerativer Erkrankung, ist häufig mit einem schwereren Verlauf verbunden. Neben Bettsicherungsmaßnahmen kommen zur medikamentösen Behandlung am häufigsten Clonazepam oder hochdosiertes Melatonin zum Einsatz. Die RBD stellt als Prodomalstadium einer neurodegenerativen Erkrankung einen zentralen Ansatzpunkt für die Entwicklung und Untersuchung einer neuroprotektiven, krankheitsmodulierenden Therapie dar.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Many medical disorders can give rise to disturbances of sleep and alter sleep architecture. Sleep can be impaired by the medical conditions themselves or by the medications used to treat them. Several symptoms associated with medical disorders, such as pain, dyspnea, nocturia, and pruritus can potentially disturb sleep, with the severity of sleep complaints waxing and waning in relation to the course of the medical illness. More than one sleep pathology may be present in a particular patient. The sleep disturbance causes distress and functional impairment, and requires independent clinical management. Conversely, sleep impairment can alter the presentation and adversely affect the symptoms of a variety of medical conditions, including respiratory, cardiac, gastrointestinal, renal, rheumatologic and infectious disorders. Asthma is a disease characterized by episodic dyspnea and wheezing, reversible episodes of bronchoconstriction, and airway hyperreactivity to a variety of specific and nonspecific stimuli. Sleep disturbance in patients with asthma can result in complaints of insomnia (including early morning awakenings) or excessive sleepiness. In one study, three of every four asthmatics reported nocturnal awakenings occurring at least once weekly, whereas two-thirds had nocturnal awakenings at least three times a week. Sleep in patients with nocturnal asthma is characterized by poor sleep quality with frequent arousals. They may awaken repeatedly due to coughing, dyspnea, wheezing, and chest discomfort. Complaints of insomnia and/or excessive daytime sleepiness are not infrequent.",

Jatharagni (digestive fire) governs the process of digestion, supported by the Tridoshas (three bio-humors). Due to a chronic imbalance of the Pachaka Pitta (digestive fire), Saman Vayu (the air entity that aids digestion), and Kledaka Kapha (the type of phlegm involved in digestion), a weak digestive fire (Mandagni) can lead to the release of food in its undigested form (Ama Utpatti), resulting in Grahani Roga. Any individual if suffering from symptoms like alternate passing of hard &amp; loose bowel habits, abdominal pain, passing of foul smelling stool, mucus in faecal matter can be diagnosed as Grahani roga. In modern science, above symptoms can be correlated with IBS (Irritable Bowel Syndrome). In IBS the wall of the intestine becomes sensitive to even mild stimulus which causes excess abdominal cramps &amp; hence the bowel movement alters along with indigestion. In India, IBS affects about 15% of adult population. This paper discusses the pathogenesis of Grahani Roga, a condition linked to impaired digestive function, and presents various treatment modalities, including herbs, Yoga, and lifestyle modifications.",

There is a significant association between disturbed sleep and GERD, and this may be bidirectional. Sleep disorders may induce gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances, while GI symptoms also may provoke or worsen sleep derangements. Reflux of gastric acid is a less frequent event during sleep, however, acid clearance mechanisms (including swallowing, salivation and primary esophageal motility) are impaired during sleep resulting in prolongation of acid contact time. Nighttime reflux can lead to sleep disturbance and sleep disturbance may further aggravate GERD by prolonged acid contact time and heightened sensory perception. This may facilitate the occurrence of complicated GERD and decreased quality of life. However, the interplay between sleep problems and GERD is complex, and there are still relatively limited data on this issue. Further investigation of sleep-related GERD may identify common pathophysiological themes and new therapeutic targets.",

The chickpea, a small legume, is a staple ingredient in culinary traditions from around the world, especially in India, the Middle East, and North Africa. Chickpea-containing dishes are also becoming more widespread in the Western world with the growing popularity of South Asian, Middle Eastern, and African cuisines. It is important to consider FDEIA in cases of unexplained anaphylaxis as reactions can occur several hours after ingesting the culprit food(s). Furthermore, no reaction occurs if a sensitized individual eats the culprit food(s) without exercising afterward; therefore, triggering foods can easily be overlooked. Current ideas on the pathophysiology, predisposing factors, workup, and treatment of FDEIA are also summarized here.",

      "abstract": "In infancy clinical manifestations of psychological distress are mainly somatic. Feeding disorders are one of the most common and nonspecific manifestations of different kinds of disturbed parent-child relationships. These disturbances may have their origins in the baby's constitution and physical status, in the parent's personality structure, or both, as has been conceptualized in the transactional model of normal and abnormal development. Among the daily interactions a baby has with parents, feeding has special inherent impact on the early parent-child relationship because of its psychological meanings. Therefore, feeding disorders, with or without failure to thrive, often reflect various disorders of infancy, still not well recognized in the medical community, such as regulatory disorders, attachment disorders, depression of infancy, disorders of separation-individuation, and post-traumatic eating disorder. 3 clinical cases are brought to increase awareness of psychological distress in the infant, and of feeding disorders as 1 of its manifestations. Each illustrates a different kind of feeding disorder in terms of etiology and pathogenesis. Through these cases we emphasize the need for a multi-disciplinary, integrative approach in diagnosis and treatment. Our conceptual background is based both on the transactional model of development (infant and parental factors impact on each other) in a very dynamic paradigm, and on psychodynamic premises. Intrapsychic conflicts and past representations impact heavily on the parenting characteristics. We emphasize the psychological significance of disturbed feeding interactions, with or without failure to thrive.",

It can rarely be induced by some drugs, including zolpidem. We present a video report of a patient with a 1-year history of SRED caused by zolpidem causing important repercussions in the sleep structure and life quality. The night eating episodes ceased promptly with discontinuation of zolpidem. Upon the follow-up, the sleep structure improved and the daily consequences disappeared. As in few reported cases of zolpidem-induced SRED, our patient was suffering from the parasomnia for a long time before the diagnosis. Active exclusion of symptoms suggestive of SRED in patients under zolpidem treatment can avoid the deleterious effect of the sleep disorder.",

      "abstract": "Patients with anorexia nervosa may minimize their symptoms with the result that doctors often fail to appreciate the distress they experience. The drastic avoidance of food is passed off euphemistically as ‘dieting’, and in later stages of the illness the patient's suffering is increased by depression, loss of concentration and insomnia. Much misery is also endured by other members of the family who observe with dread the young girl's progressive wasting and appear overwhelmed by feelings of helplessness. The illness usually runs a prolonged course even when the outcome is eventually favourable. An uncertain but sizeable proportion of patients enter a chronic phase with persistent preoccupations about food, uncontrollable overeating, self-induced vomiting, and even more severe depression (bulimia nervosa). Anorexia nervosa is therefore an illness which exacts a high toll in terms of human suffering. For this reason and in view of an increased incidence of the illness (Kendell et al, 1973; Crisp et al, 1976), it is desirable to improve methods of treatment and apply those currently available with the utmost skill.",

In some cases the disorder of a somatic system plays an important etiological rôle; in some cases there are definite emotional idiosyncrasies; in some patients special experiences have sensitized the patient in certain directions; in some there has been, even with fair equipment and with no obvious disorder of the simple emotional reactions, a balance impossible to maintain for an indefinite period. In some there are personal traits of very special nature which cannot be reduced to simpler elements. In the formulation of each case one must take into account the possibility of a disorder at each of many levels. In working at this large group of patients we still require very much more information as to the rôle played by the simple organic functions, while not neglecting the complicated development of elaborate psychological reactions. The detailed analysis of the special determination of the specific psychological reactions has been carried further than the other lines of investigation, owing to the enthusiasm of the psychoanalytic school. There remains much work to be done in regard to the rôle of the various systems (cardio-vascular, gastro-intestinal, etc.) in the setting of the emotional reactions; and the study of the personality along lines analogous to those suggested by Hoch and Amsden is an important field for further research.",

      "title": "The profile of executive function of very preterm children at 4 to 12 years",
      "abstract": "Preterm children are typically defined according to birthweight (under 2500g) or age (born before 37wks’ gestation). While much is known about the physical development of preterm children, there is considerably less research on their cognitive skills as they get older, especially in extremely preterm children (born before 30wks). On the basis of existing research, we do know that almost a quarter of very preterm children can experience cognitive problems.1 For instance, very low birthweight children can have low IQ scores, as well as learning difficulties, even with IQ scores statistically accounted.2 Aarnoudse-Moens et al. advance current understanding of cognitive development by examining very preterm children (born before 30wks, but not displaying any severe disability).3 In particular, they focus on a range of executive function skills, including working memory. More broadly, working memory is conceived as one of the executive functions responsible for goal-directed, problem-solving behavior – in addition to inhibition, shifting, planning, and other processes. Although working memory shares with these other processes a neuroanatomical association with the frontal lobes and related neural circuitry, current evidence suggests that it has a separate functional basis to other executive functions.4 Aarnoudse-Moens et al.’s results demonstrate that while the very preterm children catch up over time in measures of response inhibition, they continue to lag behind their peers in tasks of fluency, as well as working memory and planning. It is noteworthy that other researchers have found that these skills, planning in particular, rely to some extent on working memory.4 These deficits have the potential to have serious long-term consequences for these children as working memory deficits are not typically indicative of a developmental lag. A longitudinal study demonstrated that working memory skills at 5 years old are predictive of educational attainment scores 6 years later.5 One issue that is somewhat controversial is whether the executive function deficits in preterm children are indicative of ADHD or a learning disability* as both these groups manifest weaknesses in these areas.6 The benefit of Aarnoudse-Moens et al.’s study is that they recruited individuals from a large age range (4–12y) and thus, can offer insight into this question. Their research findings suggest that while younger preterm children struggled to perform well in tasks of inhibition, this pattern was not evident in the older children. The implication is that the presence of executive function deficits, including inhibitory difficulties, does not necessarily imply attention problems. Depending on the age of the child, these deficits may simply represent a learning problem that is the result of immaturity and is one that they could grow out of. Understanding the pattern of strengths and weaknesses in executive function is the first step in supporting very preterm children. There is growing evidence that cognitive skills, such as working memory, can be trained and transfer to improvements in IQ and learning scores.7",

This paper examines the nature of their relationship by reviewing clinical descriptive, family-genetic, treatment, and biological studies that relate to the issue. The studies confirm the prominence of depressive symptoms and depressive disorders in eating disorders. Other psychiatric syndromes which occur with less frequency, such as anxiety disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorders in anorexia nervosa, or personality disorders, anxiety disorders, and substance abuse in bulimia nervosa, also play an important role in the development and maintenance of eating disorders. Since few studies have controlled for starvation-induced physical, endocrine, or psychological changes which mimic the symptoms considered diagnostic for depression, further research will be needed. The evidence for a shared etiology is not compelling for anorexia nervosa and is at most suggestive for bulimia nervosa. Since in contemporary cases dieting-induced weight loss is the principal trigger, women with self-critical or depressive features will be disproportionately recruited into eating disorders. The model that fits the data best would accommodate a relationship between eating disorders and the full spectrum of depressive disorders from no depression to severe depression, with somewhat higher rates of depression in bulimic anorectic and bulimia nervosa patients than in restricting anorexia nervosa patients, but the model would admit a specific pathophysiology and psychopathology in each eating disorder.",

A number of preexisting psychiatric conditions may worsen premenstrually, including: affective disorders (depression and mania), anxiety disorders, bulimia, substance abuse, and the psychoses. The physical symptoms are reported to occur cyclically in premenstrual dysphoric disorder or premenstrual syndrome: fatigue, headache, bloating or swelling, breast tenderness, changes in appetite, insomnia, hypersomnia, weight gain, backache, and, more rarely, acne, gastrointestinal upset, vertigo, fainting, heart palpitations, flushing, clumsiness.

      "abstract": "Fatigue is the most frequent adverse event encountered in cancer patients and often underestimated by oncologists. This fatigue results in a deterioration of the quality of life physically, psychologically and socio-professionally. We have to distinguish various degrees of fatigue and identify fatigue from chronic fatigue. The acute fatigue appears normal after a physical or psychological effort and requires less than a week of rest to recover; the impact on quality of life is thus minimal. Chronic fatigue is more insidious; the causes are multiple. The patient feels that this fatigue is abnormal and disproportionate. It last several weeks and has a severe impact on the quality of life. Somatic mechanisms of fatigue related to the tumour and/or treatment are: vitaminic or proteic deficiencies due to malnutrition, accumulation of toxic metabolites, infections and septicemia, the abuse of sleeping tablets or antalgics, insomnias, immobilisation, organic insufficiencies or ionic disturbances. Anemia--observed in more than 50% of the cancerous patients--deserves a particular attention. The causes of this anemia are also multiple. It is obvious that anemia interferes with quality of life of the patient, decreases his physical performances and leads to a lack of motivation or energy. Patients with an hemoglobin level higher than 12 g/dl describe significantly less complaints and a higher physical and functional well being. To better assess the treatment of fatigue, it is important to first evaluate if the cause is organic, psychologic or mixed. Among the somatic causes, nutritious deficiencies, pain and anemia, ... all these complications can be treated with appropriate medications. This fatigue is often recognized by the patient as a progression of the tumour or as a treatment failure. Therefore, it is important to inform the patients of the possibility of that adverse event so that it does not generate additional stress and anxiety during the treatment.",

      "title": "The Explanation of Impulsive Action",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT. Impulsive action, such as binge eating or drinking, wrist‐slashing, compulsive promiscuity or chronically explosive marital conflict, presents serious problems for psychoanalysis. Such action evokes explanations both from the analyst and from the patient. The analyst may be held captive by explanatory notions that emphasise one aspect of impulsive action rather than the whole process. These explanations are based on our notions of drive pressure, adaptation, control and attack of intimate persons, ‘acting out,’ and the ‘compulsion to repeat’. The patient's explanations may be either consciously stated or inferred by the analyst as unconscious‘explanations’from associative material. If the patient's explanations dovetail with or adapt to those of the analyst, the analyst may take them as confirmatory, and the whole process of breakdown and restitution may escape analytic scrutiny. This process includes: (1) a precipitant that is narcissistically wounding; (2) a prodrome consisting of an experience of lack or absence which the patient feels as persecution, and a restitutive phantasy of the lack as fillable by a consummatory act; (3) the act itself; (4) character defences that ward off mortification on awareness of personal disintegration (shame) or the consequences of the act (guilt); explanations emphasising guilt often screen those giving rise to shame; (5) an attempt to regulate distance to protect against narcissistic injury by keeping intimates from getting too close or too far away. The therapist's tendencies to overemphasise the precipitant, the meaning of the act, or its distance regulating may convey an attitude of blame rather than understanding. Therapeutic emphasis on the subjective experience in an unintegrated way is sympathy, not empathy; sympathy is collusive and fosters splitting and impedes working with the negative transference. Blame or sympathy may be buttressed by the type of explanation accepted by analyst and patient. Explanatory preconceptions must be transcended to do effective interpretive work. Interpretation should convey understanding of a preoccupied ego that manifests its disorganising and restitutive propensities in the process of impulsive action.",

      "title": "Management of migraine: an algorithmic approach.",
      "abstract": "Good management of migraine requires that the patient participate actively in decisions regarding therapeutic intervention. Most patients, when carefully informed, will engage in a wellness program that includes regular exercise and rest, good nutrition, and avoidance of headache triggers. Acute treatment is probably most likely to be beneficial if it is started early in the migraine attack. Headache severity and associated features, such as nausea, vomiting, or previous treatment responses, can guide selection of medication for acute treatment. Simple analgesics or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, with or without antiemetics, are usually the first line of treatment and are effective for some attacks. Combination analgesics or ergotamine preparations represent second-line therapies for patients with infrequent attacks. For patients unlikely to respond to simpler treatments, 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonists or dihydroergotamine offer the best chance for relief. Narcotic analgesics may be needed when other antimigraine drugs prove ineffective, but must be prescribed judiciously. Patients with 3 or more days of headache-related disability per month, or with headaches refractory to acute treatment, are candidates for preventive therapy. Coexisting disease can contribute to decisions on prophylaxis. In many cases, a single agent may be used to treat both migraine and a coexisting disorder. beta-blockers are most often used for preventive therapy.

Tonic seizures are usually short duration (less than 1 min), and characterized by rapid onset, and increased muscle tone in extensor muscles. This causes a fall if the patient is not seated. Postictal depression is common, with associated headache and confusion. Tonic seizures are a frequent feature of the Lennox–Gastaut syndrome, along with other seizure types. The Lennox–Gastaut syndrome represents as many as 4% of all childhood epilepsies (Kramer et al. 1998).

      "title": "Understanding nutrition, depression and mental illnesses",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Few people are aware of the connection between nutrition and depression while they easily understand the connection between nutritional deficiencies and physical illness. Depression is more typically thought of as strictly biochemical-based or emotionally-rooted. On the contrary, nutrition can play a key role in the onset as well as severity and duration of depression. Many of the easily noticeable food patterns that precede depression are the same as those that occur during depression. These may include poor appetite, skipping meals, and a dominant desire for sweet foods.[1] Nutritional neuroscience is an emerging discipline shedding light on the fact that nutritional factors are intertwined with human cognition, behavior, and emotions. The most common mental disorders that are currently prevalent in numerous countries are depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).[2] The dietary intake pattern of the general population in many Asian and American countries reflects that they are often deficient in many nutrients, especially essential vitamins, minerals, and omega-3 fatty acids.[3] A notable feature of the diets of patients suffering from mental disorders is the severity of deficiency in these nutrients.[3] Studies have indicated that daily supplements of vital nutrients are often effective in reducing patients' symptoms.[4] Supplements containing amino acids have also been found to reduce symptoms, as they are converted to neurotransmitters which in turn alleviate depression and other mental health problems.[4] On the basis of accumulating scientific evidence, an effective therapeutic intervention is emerging, namely nutritional supplement/treatment. These may be appropriate for controlling and to some extent, preventing depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, eating disorders and anxiety disorders, attention deficit disorder/attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADD/ADHD), autism, and addiction.[4] Most prescription drugs, including the common antidepressants lead to side effects.[4] This usually causes the patients to skip taking their medications. Such noncompliance is a common occurrence encountered by psychiatrists. An important point to remember here is that, such noncompliant patients who have mental disorders are at a higher risk for committing suicide or being institutionalized. In some cases, chronic use or higher doses may lead to drug toxicity, which may become life threatening to the patient.[4] An alternate and effective way for psychiatrists to overcome this noncompliance is to familiarize themselves about alternative or complementary nutritional therapies. Although further research needs to be carried out to determine the best recommended doses of most nutritional supplements in the cases of certain nutrients, psychiatrists can recommend doses of dietary supplements based on previous and current efficacious studies and then adjust the doses based on the results obtained by closely observing the changes in the patient.[4] When we take a close look at the diet of depressed people, an interesting observation is that their nutrition is far from adequate. They make poor food choices and selecting foods that might actually contribute to depression. Recent evidence suggests a link between low levels of serotonin and suicide.[5] It is implicated that lower levels of this neurotransmitter can, in part, lead to an overall insensitivity to future consequences, triggering risky, impulsive and aggressive behaviors which may culminate in suicide, the ultimate act of inwardly directed impulsive aggression. Depression is a disorder associated with major symptoms such as increased sadness and anxiety, loss of appetite, depressed mood, and a loss of interest in pleasurable activities. If there is no timely therapeutic intervention, this disorder can lead to varied consequences. Patients who are suffering from depression exhibit suicidal tendency to a larger degree and hence are usually treated with antidepressants and/or psychotherapy.[6] Deficiencies in neurotransmitters such as serotonin, dopamine, noradrenaline, and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) are often associated with depression.[6–11] As reported in several studies, the amino acids tryptophan, tyrosine, phenylalanine, and methionine are often helpful in treating many mood disorders including depression.[12–17] When consumed alone on an empty stomach, tryptophan, a precursor of serotonin, is usually converted to serotonin. Hence, tryptophan can induce sleep and tranquility. This implies restoring serotonin levels lead to diminished depression precipitated by serotonin deficiencies.[8] Tyrosine and sometimes its precursor phenylalanine are converted into dopamine and norepinephrine.[18] Dietary supplements containing phenyl alanine and/or tyrosine cause alertness and arousal. Methionine combines with adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to produce S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), which facilitates the production of neurotransmitters in the brain.[19–22] The need of the present paradigm is, more studies shedding light on the daily supplemental doses of these neurochemicals that should be consumed to achieve antidepressant effects. Researchers attribute the decline in the consumption of omega-3 fatty acids from fish and other sources in most populations to an increasing trend in the incidence of major depression.[23] The two omega-3 fatty acids, eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) which the body converts into docosahexanoic acid (DHA), found in fish oil, have been found to elicit antidepressant effects in human. Many of the proposed mechanisms of this conversion involve neurotransmitters. For instance, antidepressant effects may be due to bioconversion of EPA to leukotrienes, prostaglandins, and other chemicals required by the brain. Others hypothesize that both EPA and DHA influence neuronal signal transduction by activating peroxisomal proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), inhibiting G-proteins and protein kinase C, in addition to calcium, sodium, and potassium ion channels. Whichever may be the case, epidemiological data and clinical studies have clearly shown that omega-3 fatty acids can effectively treat depression.[24] In depressed patients, daily consumption of dietary supplements of omega-3 fatty acid that contain 1.5-2 g of EPA has been shown to stimulate mood elevation. Nevertheless, doses of omega-3 higher than 3 g do not show better effects than placebos and may be contraindicative in cases, such as those taking anticlotting drugs.[25] In addition to omega–3 fatty acids, vitamin B (e.g., folate) and magnesium deficiencies have been linked to depression.[26–28] Randomized, controlled trials that involve folate and vitamin B12 suggest that patients treated with 0.8 mg of folic acid/day or 0.4 mg of vitamin B12/day will exhibit decreased depression symptoms.[27] In addition, the results of several case studies where patients were treated with 125-300 mg of magnesium (as glycinate or taurinate) with each meal and at bedtime led to rapid recovery from major depression in < 7 days for most of the patients. Previous research has revealed the link between nutritional deficiencies and some mental disorders.[232529–32] The most common nutritional deficiencies seen in patients with mental disorders are of omega–3 fatty acids, B vitamins, minerals, and amino acids that are precursors to neurotransmitters.[20232427283033] Accumulating evidence from demographic studies indicates a link between high fish consumption and low incidence of mental disorders; this lower incidence rate being the direct result of omega–3 fatty acid intake.[233132] One to two grams of omega-3 fatty acids taken daily is the generally accepted dose for healthy individuals, but for patients with mental disorders, up to 9.6 g has been shown to be safe and effective.[34–36] Majority of Asian diets are usually also lacking in fruits and vegetables, which further lead to mineral and vitamin deficiencies. The significance of various nutrients in mental health, with special relevance to depression has been discussed below. CARBOHYDRATES Carbohydrates are naturally occurring polysaccharides and play an important role in structure and function of an organism. In higher organisms (human), they have been found to affect mood and behavior. Eating a meal which is rich in carbohydrates triggers the release of insulin in the body. Insulin helps let blood sugar into cells where it can be used for energy and simultaneously it triggers the entry of tryptophan to brain. Tryptophan in the brain affects the neurotransmitters levels. Consumption of diets low in carbohydrate tends to precipitate depression, since the production of brain chemicals serotonin and tryptophan that promote the feeling of well being, is triggered by carbohydrate rich foods. It is suggested that low glycemic index (GI) foods such as some fruits and vegetables, whole grains, pasta, etc. are more likely to provide a moderate but lasting effect on brain chemistry, mood, and energy level than the high GI foods - primarily sweets - that tend to provide immediate but temporary relief. PROTEINS Proteins are made up of amino acids and are important building blocks of life. As many as 12 amino acids are manufactured in the body itself and remaining 8 (essential amino acids) have to be supplied through diet. A high quality protein diet contains all essential amino acids. Foods rich in high quality protein include meats, milk and other dairy products, and eggs. Plant proteins such as beans, peas, and grains may be low in one or two essential amino acids. Protein intake and in turn the individual amino acids can affect the brain functioning and mental health. Many of the neurotransmitters in the brain are made from amino acids. The neurotransmitter dopamine is made from the amino acid tyrosine and the neurotransmitter serotonin is made from the tryptophan.[5] If there is a lack of any of these two amino acids, there will not be enough synthesis of the respective neurotransmitters, which is associated with low mood and aggression in the patients. The excessive buildup of amino acids may also lead to brain damage and mental retardation. For example, excessive buildup of phenylalanine in the individuals with disease called phenylketonuria can cause brain damage and mental retardation. ESSENTIAL FATTY ACIDS Omega-3 fatty acids The brain is one of the organs with the highest level of lipids (fats). Brain lipids, composed of fatty acids, are structural constituents of membranes. It has been estimated that gray matter contains 50% fatty acids that are polyunsaturated in nature (about 33% belong to the omega-3 family), and hence are supplied through diet. In one of the first experimental demonstrations of the effect of dietary substances (nutrients) on the structure and function of the brain, the omega-3 fatty acids (specially alpha-linolenic acid, ALA) were the member to take part. An important trend has been observed from the findings of some recent studies that lowering plasma cholesterol by diet and medications increases depression. Among the significant factors involved are the quantity and ratio of omega-6 and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) that affect serum lipids and alter the biochemical and biophysical properties of cell membranes. It has been hypothesized that sufficient long chain PUFAs, especially DHA, may decrease the development of depression.[37] The structural and functional components of membrane in cells of brain which is a lipid-rich organ, include polar phospholipids, spingolipids, and cholesterol. The glycerophospholipids in brain consist of high proportion of PUFA derived from the essential fatty acids (EFAs), linoleic acid and α-linolenic acid. The main PUFA in the brain are DHA, derived from the omega-3 fatty acid α-linolenic acid, arachidonic acid (AA) and docosa tetraenoic acid, both derived from omega-6 fatty acid linoleic acid. Experimental studies have revealed that diets lacking omega-3 PUFA lead to considerable disturbance in neural function.[38] Studies by Marszalek and Lodish indicate that despite their abundance in the nervous system, DHA and AA cannot be synthesized by mammals de novo and hence they or their precursors have to be supplied through the diet and transported to the brain. During late gestation and the early postnatal period, neurodevelopment occurs at significantly rapid rates which make the supply of adequate quantity of PUFAs, particularly DHA, imperative to ensure neurite outgrowth in addition to appropriate development of brain and retina.[39] Bruinsma and Taren of University of Arizona College of Public Health, Tucson, USA explored the involvement of dieting-related psychological factors as potential confounders.[40] They discussed studies that have both supported and contested the proposition that lowering plasma cholesterol by diet and medications contributes to depression. Research findings point out that an imbalance in the ratio of the EFAs, namely the omega-6 and omega-3 fatty acids, and/or a deficiency in omega-3 fatty acids, may be responsible for the heightened depressive symptoms associated with low plasma cholesterol. These relationships may explain the inconsistency in the results of trials on cholesterol-lowering interventions and depression. On similar lines, dieting behaviors have been associated with alterations in moods.[41] Dietary omega-3 fatty acids play a role in the prevention of some disorders including depression. Their deficiency can accelerate cerebral aging by preventing the renewal of membranes. However, the respective roles of the vascular component on one hand (where the omega-3s are active) and the cerebral parenchyma itself on the other, have not yet been clearly resolved. The role of omega–3 in certain diseases such as dyslexia and autism is suggested. It was omega–3 fatty acids that participated in the first coherent experimental demonstration of the effect of dietary substances (nutrients) on the structure and function of the brain. Experiments were first of all carried out on x-vivo cultured brain cells (1), then on in vivo brain cells (2), finally on physicochemical, biochemical, physiological, neurosensory, and behavioral parameters (3). These findings indicated that the nature of polyunsaturated fatty acids (in particular omega–3) present in formula milks for infants (both premature and term) determines the visual, cerebral, and intellectual abilities.[16] VITAMINS B-complex vitamins Nutrition and depression are intricately and undeniably linked, as suggested by the mounting evidence by researchers in neuropsychiatry. According to a study reported in Neuropsychobiology,[42] supplementation of nine vitamins, 10 times in excess of normal recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for 1 year improved mood in both men and women. The interesting part was that these changes in mood after a year occurred even though the blood status of nine vitamins reached a plateau after 3 months. This mood improvement was particularly associated with improved vitamin B2 and B6 status. In women, baseline vitamin B1 status was linked with poor mood and an improvement in the same after 3 months was associated with improved mood. Thiamine is known to modulate cognitive performance particularly in the geriatric population.[43] Vitamin B12 (Cynocobalamin) Clinical trials have indicated that Vitamin B12 delays the onset of signs of dementia (and blood abnormalities), if it is administered in a precise clinical timing window, before the onset of the first symptoms. Supplementation with cobalamin enhances cerebral and cognitive functions in the elderly; it frequently promotes the functioning of factors related to the frontal lobe, in addition to the language function of people with cognitive disorders. Adolescents who have a borderline level of vitamin B12 deficiency develop signs of cognitive changes.[43] Folate It has been observed that patients with depression have blood folate levels, which are, on an average, 25% lower than healthy controls.[44] Low levels of folate have also been identified as a strong predisposing factor of poor outcome with antidepressant therapy. A controlled study has been reported to have shown that 500 mcg of folic acid enhanced the effectiveness of antidepressant medication.[45] Folate's critical role in brain metabolic pathways has been well recognized by various researchers who have noted that depressive symptoms are the most common neuropsychiatric manifestation of folate deficiency.[46] It is not clear yet whether poor nutrition, as a symptom of depression, causes folate deficiency or primary folate deficiency produces depression and its symptoms. MINERALS Calcium A recent study showed that selective serotonin uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) inhibit absorption of calcium into bones. In addition to this, the SSRIs can also lower blood pressure in people, resulting in falls which may lead to broken bones. Indiscriminate prescription of SSRIs by doctors and ingestion by patients at risk of depression or other mental health problems may put them at increased risk of fractures. Compounded by the fact that they may be aging and already taking other medications, may also predispose them to osteoporosis.[47] Chromium Many studies on the association of chromium in humans depression have been recorded[4849] which indicate the significance of this micronutrient in mental health. Iodine Iodine plays an important role in mental health. The iodine provided by the thyroid hormone ensures the energy metabolism of the cerebral cells. During pregnancy, the dietary reduction of iodine induces severe cerebral dysfunction, eventually leading to cretinism. Iron Iron is necessary for oxygenation and to produce energy in the cerebral parenchyma (through cytochrome oxidase), and for the synthesis of neurotransmitters and myelin. Iron deficiency is found in children with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Iron concentrations in the umbilical artery are critical during the development of the foetus, and in relation with the IQ in the child; Infantile anemia with its associated iron deficiency is associated with disturbance in the development of cognitive functions.[43] Research findings pointed out that twice as many women as men are clinically depressed. This gender difference starts in adolescence and becomes more pronounced among married women aged 25-45, with children. Furthermore, women of childbearing age experience more depression than during other times in their lives. These indicate the possible importance of iron in the etiology of depression since its deficiency is known to cause fatigue and depression. Iron deficiency anemia is associated, for instance, with apathy, depression, and rapid fatigue when exercising.[43] Lithium Lithium, a monovalent cation, was first discovered and defined by Johan August in 1817 while he did an analysis of the mineral petalite. The role of lithium has been well known in psychiatry. Half a century into its use, its choice for bipolar disorder with antimanic, antidepressant, and antisuicidal property. The therapeutic use of lithium also includes its usage as an augmenting agent in depression, scizoaffective disorder, aggression, impulse control disorder, eating disorders, ADDs, and in certain subsets of alcoholism.[50] But adequate care has to be taken while using lithium, the gold standard mood stabilizer, in the mentally ill. Lithium can be used in patients with cardiovascular, renal, endocrine, pulmonary, and dermatological comorbidity. The use of lithium during pregnancy and lactation, in pediatric and geriatric population needs careful observation about its toxicity. Selenium In a large review, Dr. David Benton of the university of Wales identified at least five studies, which indicate that low selenium intake is associated with lowered mood status.[51] Intervention studies with selenium with other patient populations reveal that selenium improves mood and diminishes anxiety.[5253] Zinc Zinc participates among others in the process of gustation (taste perception). At least five studies have shown that zinc levels are lower in those with clinical depression.[54] Furthermore, intervention research shows that oral zinc can influence the effectiveness of antidepressant therapy.[55] Zinc also protects the brain cells against the potential damage caused by free radicals. Several studies have revealed the full genetic potential of the child for physical development and mental development may be compromised due to deficiency (even subclinical) of micronutrients. When children and adolescents with poor nutritional status are exposed to alterations of mental and behavioral functions, they can be corrected by dietary measures, but only to certain extent. It has been observed that, nutrient composition of diet and meal pattern can have beneficial or adverse, immediate or long-term effects. Dietary deficiencies of antioxidants and nutrients (trace elements, vitamins, and nonessential micronutrients such as polyphenols) during aging may precipitate brain diseases, which may be due to failure for protective mechanism against free radicals. OTHER PHYSIOLOGICAL AND PSYCHOSOCIAL FACTORS Another angle of viewing diet and depression involves old age, which is a time of vulnerability to unintentional weight loss, a factor that is often linked to increased morbidity and premature death. Anorexia of aging may play an important role in precipitating this, by either reducing food intake directly or reducing food intake in response to such adverse factors as age-associated reductions in sensory perception (taste and smell), poor dentition, use of multiple prescription drugs, and depression.[56] Marcus and Berry[57] reviewed malnutrition occurring in the elderly, in both institutional and community settings, due to refusal to eat. They suggest physiologic changes associated with aging, mental disorders such as dementia and depression, and medical, social, and environmental as causative factors. Currently to tackle the problem of depression, people are following the alternative and complementary medicine (CAM) interventions. CAM therapies are defined by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine as a group of diverse medical and health systems, practices, and products that are not currently considered to be a part of conventional medicine.[58] Mental health professionals need to be aware that it is likely that a fair number of their patients with bipolar disorder might use CAM interventions. Some clinicians judge these interventions to be attractive and safe alternatives, or adjuncts to conventional psychotropic medications.[59] Current research in psychoneuroimmunology and brain biochemistry indicates the possibility of communication pathways that can provide a clearer understanding of the association between nutritional intake, central nervous system, and immune function thereby influencing an individual's psychological health status. These findings may lead to greater acceptance of the therapeutic value of dietary intervention among health practitioners and health care providers addressing depression and other psychological disorders.",

      "abstract": "Eating problems are commonly encountered in childhood and adolescents, and may be manifestation of a variety of psychiatric disorders when medical causes are excluded. We present the case of a young lady presenting with problems of eating which presented with difficulties of ascribing a diagnostic label for eating problems. The patient, a 12-year-old girl with history suggestive of mild mental retardation and juvenile myoclonic epilepsy presented with selective eating of foodstuffs which improved spontaneously in 2 months. The different diagnostic possibilities entertained for the case are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is the most serious and disabling of all mental disorders, affecting just under 1 % of the population. While its etiological bases remain obscure and consequently its nosological boundaries are uncertain, the condition classically has its onset in childhood or early adolescence [1]. It is characterized by (1) \"positive\" psychotic symptoms like delusions (fixed false ideas that are held with unshakable conviction), hallucinations (perceptions without a stimulus), and thought disorder (difficulty in assembling a coherent stream of speech); (2) so-called negative symptoms like lack of motivation and pleasure, inability of expressing the full range of emotions, neglect of personal appearance, and disinterest in life events; and (3) cognitive impairment (memory and attention difficulties) [2]. All of these attributes, persistent over time, culminate in a decline in social and occupational performance. These features – coupled with the consequences of sustained impairment – result in comorbid depression (see chapter \" Major depressive disorder \") among people with schizophrenia. Approximately 50 % of patients attempt and about 4 % of patients commit suicide. Schizophrenia is poorly understood by the public, and it is often highly stigmatizing [3].",

Weakness usually starts with the legs, with proximal distribution and minimal sensory loss. However occasionally weakness begin in upper limbs and or cranial nerves, distribution. Any patient who presents acutely with symmetric, proximal weakness associated with decreased or absent muscle stretch reflexes should be considered as having GBS, until proven otherwise. The weakness evolves within days to weeks, most commonly peaking in 2–3 weeks. Cranial nerve and respiratory muscle weakness usually occur later.

A common condition impacting not only the teeth but gumjawbone complex, temporal mandibular joint, muscles, tendons, ligaments and softtissues of the oral cavity is that of “gnashing of teeth.” We in the honorable art and science of dentistry call this condition bruxism, tapping, jiggling or extra-oral movements (parafunctional habits) that may impede breathing, influence headache, or other super-pectoral painful conditions such as neuropathies. After 55 years of practice I have observed a huge rise in these condition in the past ten to fifteen years. Oral Bruxism condition is associated with snoring, clapping of teeth, airway compromise, and their attending effects—loss of sleep, quality of sleep as well as emotional implications. Upper Airway Resistance Syndrome (UARS) is the condition identified from a medical view and, related to snoring, grinding of teeth, tapping, jiggling and has led many to devices such as an electrical stimulator called “Inspire” (figure 2.) which is alleged as an alternative to Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP—see figure 1.) that works inside your body while you sleep. It’s a small electrical device placed during a same-day, outpatient procedure below the collar bone that monitors breathing and stimulates the tongue to reposition for better breathing, hopefully. Obstructive sleep apnea is the most common form of sleep apnea and occurs when the throat muscles relax and block the airway during sleep. Of course, this is theory with some facts in logic, in my humble opinion. About 18 million American adults have moderate to severe obstructive sleep apnea.Another approach in resolution of these condition are oral positioners as shown below, Figure 3 below. All of these devices are made of hard plastics that may cause more harm than good in my experience and estimation. They are often of novel colors to encourage acceptance of their many designs. Constructed to fit the upper arch and lower and work together they are complex and ill-fitting mostly.",

      "abstract": "Dhatukshaya, or the depletion of bodily tissues, is a fundamental concept in ayurveda that highlights the progressive degeneration of the seven dhatus. Prameha progresses through stages linked to the tridosha: kapha in early stages, pitta in intermediate stages, and vata in advanced stages, exacerbating degeneration due to dhatu shitilata (tissue laxity) and obstruction in the srotas. The pathogenesis of prameha involves derangement of doshas, subsequent impairment of dhatwagni, and metabolic disturbances in the dhatus, which in turn disrupt normal carbohydrate, fat, and protein metabolism. These further damages the tissues and impacts the mutravaha srotas (urinary system). Prameha progressively affects multiple dhatus (tissues) including rasa, meda, and majja, leading to symptoms such as polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia, fatigue, dryness, and neuropathy. Tissue depletion disrupts nourishment, fluid balance, and energy reserves, resulting in systemic complications over time. Diabetes Mellitus has become a major global health concern, causing extensive numerous cellular damages in different organs at various stages of the disease. Diabetes contributes or accelerates the process of degeneration by chronic hyperglycemia, oxidative stress, advanced glycation end products (AGEs), inflammation and immune dysregulation.",

      "abstract": "Frailty is a clinical situation of decreased homeostatic reserve that, after a minor trigger (acute illness, fall, taking a drug...) increases the risk of an adverse event such as hospital admission, institutionalization, functional and/or cognitive decline, death, etc. Frailty can be understood as physical frailty, Fried's phenotype, a true geriatric syndrome that can be reversible by avoiding its progression to more advanced stages of irreversibility and dependence, and Rockwood's frailty due to accumulation of deficits, as a continuum of health or classification typology of the elderly along the frailty spectrum (healthy, robust, vulnerable, mild-moderate-severe and extreme frailty or end of life). The diagnosis of physical frailty is part of the comprehensive geriatric assessment, recommending the use of a performance test such as gait speed (<0,8m/s), Timed Up and Go (>12 s) or Short Physical Performance Battery (<10). Physical frailty is reversible by a multidisciplinary management based on three fundamental pillars: multicomponent physical exercise and resistance training, adequate protein and micronutrient intake (leucine, vitamin D, etc.) and appropriate pharmacological prescription, management of comorbidity and geriatric syndromes. Frailty is a risk factor for neurological disease progression and increased risk of adverse events in neurodegenerative diseases such as mild cognitive impairment, dementia, Parkinson's disease and cerebrovascular disease. Frailty based on the Clinical Frailty Scale or VIG-Frail shows patient typologies in relation to a greater or lesser state of fragility, being a basic prognostic tool of great utility in making diagnostic and therapeutic management decisions. It opens up a new opportunity for improvement in the management of neurological disease in the diagnosis and treatment of frailty.Concepto y manejo práctico de la fragilidad en neurología.La fragilidad se entiende como un situación clínica de disminución de la reserva homeostática que, ante un desencadenante (enfermedad aguda, caída, toma de un fármaco...), aumenta el riesgo de un evento adverso, como ingreso hospitalario, en residencia, deterioro funcional y/o cognitivo, muerte, etc. La fragilidad puede entenderse como fragilidad física, fenotipo de Fried, verdadero síndrome geriátrico, que puede ser reversible evitando su progresión a estadios más avanzados de irreversibilidad y de dependencia, y fragilidad por acúmulo de déficits de Rockwood, como continuum de salud o tipología de clasificación del anciano a lo largo del espectro de la fragilidad (sano, robusto, vulnerable, fragilidad leve-moderada-grave y extrema o final de vida). El diagnóstico de fragilidad física forma parte de la valoración geriátrica integral y se recomienda para su diagnóstico utilizar un test de ejecución, como velocidad de la marcha (menor de 0,8 m/s), Timed Up and Go (>12 segundos) o Short Physical Performance Battery (menor de 10). La fragilidad física es reversible basándose en un tratamiento multidisciplinar sobre tres pilares fundamentales: ejercicio físico multicompetente y contra resistencia, aporte adecuado de proteínas y micronutrientes (leucina, vitamina D, etc.), y adecuada prescripción farmacológica, de tratamiento de comorbilidad y de síndromes geriátricos. La fragilidad es un factor de riesgo de progresión de la enfermedad neurológica y de mayor riesgo de evento adverso tanto en enfermedades neurodegenerativas, como el deterioro cognitivo leve, la demencia o la enfermedad de Parkinson, como en la enfermedad cerebrovascular. La fragilidad a través de la Clinical Frailty Scale o el VIG-Frail muestra tipologías de pacientes en relación con un mayor o menor estado de fragilidad, y es una herramienta básica pronóstica de gran utilidad en la toma de decisiones de manejo diagnóstico y terapéutico. Se abre una nueva oportunidad de mejora en el manejo de la enfermedad neurológica ante el diagnóstico y el tratamiento de la fragilidad.",

Up to 10% of adults have a seizure during their lifetime, with increasing incidence in people older than 55 years. One-third of people have a recurrent seizure within one year of an initial unprovoked seizure. Acute symptomatic (provoked) seizures recur less often, especially when provoking factors are addressed. After confirming a probable seizure, evaluation focuses on identifying provoking factors such as tumor, metabolic derangement, infectious disease, stroke, traumatic brain injury, medications, or substance misuse. Magnetic resonance imaging with an epilepsy protocol and electroencephalography should be performed as soon as practical. Lumbar puncture is useful if intracranial infection is suspected. Immediate initiation of anti-seizure medication reduces seizure recurrence by 35% within the first two years. Recurrence rates between three and five years are similar between patients who start anti-seizure medication immediately after the first seizure and those who do not. Restoration of driving privileges varies by state. After a seizure, safety concerns should be addressed, such as the need for a safety companion when bathing or swimming and the risks of ladders and other hazards.",

Examples given include circadian sleep–wake cycle disorders (such as the delayed sleep phase syndrome), obstructive sleep apnoea, narcolepsy, Kleine–Levin syndrome, sleep paralysis and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behaviour disorder.

      "abstract": "Dear Editor, We read with interest the article titled \"Retinal arterial occlusions in the young: Systemic[1] associations in Indian population by Ratra et al. Authors have mentioned severe headache, floaters and transient blurring of vision as the presenting symptoms in a subset of patients. Visual aura (migraine) are fully reversible symptoms including positive features (e.g., flickering of lights, spots or lines) and negative features (i.e., loss of vision). A migraine diathesis may be a marker for an underlying defect such as hypertension, hypercoagulability, lupus erythematosis or mitral valve prolapse and therefore might occasionally co-occur with[2] vascular occlusion or retinal vasospasm. Experts disagree whether retinal migraine is a rare or common cause of monocular visual loss and whether the mechanism is spreading depression or vasospasm. Complicated migraine refers to a permanent neurologic deficit whether it is visual, motor or sensory in origin. In some instances the stroke does not respect the usual middle or posterior cerebral artery territories suggesting that a strict vascular mechanism is insufficient to[3] explain all migraine-related stroke phenomena. Cocaine abuse cause hypertensive surges, stroke, arterial and venous thrombosis. Neuroimaging studies in cocaine abusers demonstrated abnormal perfusion involving the infraparietal,[4] temporal and anterofrontal cortex and basal ganglia. Dopamine-rich brain regions appear to be relatively specific targets for cocaine-induced cerebral ischemia. Dopamine is one of the[5] numerous neurotransmitters present in outer and inner layers of the retina. Cocaine abuse,[3] exercise and lupus cause non-migrainous retinal vasospasm and transient monocular visual loss. Authors have documented hypertension, cerebrovascular accident and basal ganglia infarction in a 37-year-old patient. In our practice we routinely inform the possibility of underlying systemic disease and importance of physician consultation in all patients with migraine. Perimetry may be useful to identify coexisting cerebral ischemia in patients with retinal vascular occlusion and normal neuroimaging study. We appreciate the authors' effort and research work.

Developmental delay is present when a child does not reach developmental milestones at the expected age (with adequate leeway for the broad variation among normal children). Although delay may result primarily from a biological factor such as a chromosomal disorder, or an environmental factor such as maternal depression, the principal model for the causes of developmental delay is a ‘transactional’ one. The process of development is viewed as a transaction between the child and the environment, in which each can have profound effects on the other. About 15% of children have developmental delay. Many, however, are not detected before commencing school, mainly because the disabilities are mild or because they relate to tasks only then attempted by the child. Of the 15%, a much smaller proportion has more severe disability. This group is more likely to present earlier because of the severity of their problems, because there is more often an associated medical condition, and because a number of them (such as those with extreme prematurity) are picked up by at-risk screening programs.",

Por ejemplo, aún no está del todo claro, por la poca evidencia disponible, cómo se relacionan el estrés académico y los hábitos de estudio inadecuados o la ansiedad y la somnolencia diurna en un ambiente educativo con estas características. Si estas asociaciones se demuestran, o se llegan a entender mejor, se podría concluir entonces que estudiar medicina (en particular) o una carrera universitaria con demandas académicas y emocionales similares (en general), tendría un nexo causal con los problemas de salud vinculados con la ansiedad, las alteraciones del sueño y los altos índices de estrés. Estos problemas incluyen, por ejemplo, las enfermedades mentales, como la depresión, o las alteraciones cardiovasculares, como la hipertensión arterial.

These conditions may have some similar manifestations, making differential diagnosis difficult. Depressed alcoholics report more previous treatment for substance abuse, withdrawal symptoms, and marital problems than those without depression. They also incur greater loneliness, unemployment, and social ineptness. Depressive symptoms found commonly in this group include work inhibition, guilt, self-disgust, dissatisfaction, and social disinterest. A history of depression among relatives favors a dual diagnosis of alcoholism and depression. Distinguishing those alcoholics with specific depressive illness enhances the therapeutic efficacy. Alcohol abusers need treatment, but those with concomitant depression persisting well beyond detoxification often require antidepressant medications. In long-term care, lithium may reduce alcohol-related rehospitalizations. A strong doctor-patient relationship with or without pharmacotherapy promotes continuation in a therapeutic regimen. Involvement in Alcoholics Anonymous and disulfiram maintenance therapy are other deterrents to drinking relapse.",

In many countries, until recently, epilepsy was conceptualized as a mental health disorder. Epilepsy can be associated not only with episodic behavioral disorders ictally and during the peri-ictal period but also with chronic behavioral disturbances interictally. Indeed, even when optimal seizure control is achieved and cognitive impairment is absent, epidemiological studies have shown greater vulnerability of people with epilepsy toward psychosocial distress (Sillanpää et al. 1998). A wide variety of etiologies affecting the central nervous system (CNS) can involve very similar behavioral signs and symptoms (Table 10–1 ). Primary signs and symptoms of central nervous system disturbances Cognitive Affective dysregulation Communication/language dysfunction Intellectual impairment Impaired judgment Dysmnesia/inattention Disorientation Behavioral Anxiety Alteration in arousal Mood (elevation, depression, apathy) Motor (hyperkinetic, hypokinetic, or akinetic) Personality traits/changes Dyspraxia Perceptions Auditory Gustatory Kinesthetic pain/paresthesias/anesthesia Olfactory Visual Source. Adapted from Tucker 2002, p. 674. In this chapter, we first provide an overview of the evaluation and management of epilepsy, focusing on the diverse neurobehavioral manifestations of seizures as influenced by seizure origin and extent of electrical propagation. In subsequent sections, we review the evaluation and management of the more common neuropsychiatric complications and comorbidities of the epilepsies and seizures.",

      "abstract": "The psychic reevocation of disturbance of the colon or disturbances of other body districts not felt by the patient at the time facilitates the accentuation of colon motility or tone, leading to the exacerbation of the pathogenetic premises of the disturbances complained of. The colonmetrographic findings are instructive in this respect. Direct functional disturbance of various districts is also suggested, and the pathology of such forms in psychosomatically oriented patients is described. Such orientation takes the form of a ready translation of ideas into rather diffuse somatic changes that are partly aspecific, due to the predominance of response mechanisms that are more physiological than psychological. The picture is one of a primordial reaction to difficulties and problems, coupled with increased stress, sometimes to the points of vegetative or motor storms, in the expectation of help from outside, such help being represented in the past by intervention on the part of the mother.",

Here, we report a 60‐year‐old male patient who presented with a sudden onset of disorientation and short‐term memory loss and started to ask about his whereabouts and what happened. He had no significant past medical or psychiatric disorder. Likewise, the patient did not have a recent history of head trauma, substance abuse, loss of consciousness, seizure disorder, or migraine. Neurologic examination was normal except for mild disorientation and short‐term memory impairment. He had a score of 18/30 on the mini‐mental state examination. Extensive laboratory investigations did not show any abnormal findings. Brain MRI and EEG were normal. His memory improved and returned to a normal baseline within 24 h from the onset. After the exclusion of potential causes and the patient returned to a normal state of memory, the diagnosis of transient global amnesia was made. At the follow‐up visit, the patient was in a state of normal function without a recurrence of memory impairment. Here, we presented this interesting case of transient global amnesia. TGA is a diagnosis of exclusion and is essential to keep in mind when evaluating a patient with acute onset of short‐term memory impairment, especially when etiological investigations reveal no potential cause.",

      "title": "Marchiafava–Bignami Disease: A Rare Finding in Alcohol Dependence Syndrome",
      "abstract": "Sir, Marchiafava–Bignami disease (MBD) is a rare demyelinating disorder, associated with alcohol consumption over a prolonged period of time and malnutrition. Diagnosis is often missed due to symptoms mimicking other acute neurological conditions and approximately 250 cases have been reported worldwide.[1,2] This disease is characteristically diagnosed on neuroimaging, which is demonstrated as demyelination and necrosis of the corpus callosum.[3] We present the case of a 27-year-old male who presented with a history of road traffic accident under the influence of alcohol. He sustained injuries to the face and head, which was also associated with a brief loss of consciousness followed by agitation, altered sensorium, slurred speech, and gait abnormality. There was no history of posttraumatic seizure, vomiting, headache, cerebrospinal fluid leak, and hemotympanum. However, the patient was agitated, ataxic, and dysarthric with mild impairment in consciousness and the Glasgow Coma Scale on presentation was 10/15 (E3V3M4). Pupils were noticed to be of normal size and were normally reacting. There was no autonomic instability and neurological deficits on clinical examination. Noncontrast computed tomography head revealed an undisplaced fracture of the body of the mandible near the left angle of the mandible. There was no evidence of traumatic brain injury on the computed tomography (CT) scan. Laboratory results revealed a normal hematological profile, but the liver function tests revealed increased Serum Gamma Glutamyl Transferase (SGGT) 163 U/L, Serum Glutamic- Oxaloacetic Transaminase (SGOT)-85 IU/L, Serum Glutamic Pyruvic Transaminase (SGPT)-322 IU/L, and ultrasonography of the abdomen revealed hepatomegaly with Grade-1 fatty liver. The patient demonstrated progressively increasing psychomotor action and worsening altered sensorium (mini-mental state examination [MMSE]-24/30 and Montreal cognitive assessment [MOCA]-19/30) with poor ideomotor recovery. A history revealed progressively increasing alcohol consumption over a period of 7-year fulfilling criteria of alcohol dependence syndrome as per the International Classification of Diseases-10. T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan revealed hyperintensity in the body and splenium of the corpus callosum on the left side suggestive of Type B MBD [Figure 1]. The patient was started on high doses of injectable thiamine hydrochloride 1.5 g/day in an intravenous infusion and injectable multivitamins along with oral anticraving drugs in the form of acamprosate (333 mg 2-2-2) in conjunction with forced abstinence. The patient responded satisfactory to treatment with improvement of sensorium and restoration of normal psychomotor activity. After stabilization, he was imparted with structured Yoga and Meditation (YogNidra and Pranayam) therapy by a trained yoga therapist. Cognitive retraining with cognitive restructuring App (Luminous) along with individual and group psychotherapy by a clinical psychologist in a deaddiction center aimed at relapse prevention. Over the next 3 months, the patient's cognitive functions improved (MMSE - 30/30 and MOCA - 29/30). MRI brain repeated after 12 weeks of the treatment revealed complete resolution of lesions [Figure 2].Figure 1: MRI brain of the patient at initial presentation prior to the start of the treatment. (a) Axial T2-weighted MR image, (b) coronal T2-weighted MR image, and (c) axial FLAIR MR image reveal hyperintensities in the splenium of the corpus callosum on the left side, (d) sagittal T1-weighted MR image shows hypodensities in the splenium of the corpus callosum in the central part sparing peripheral most part showing \"Sandwich sign.\" MRI: Magnetic resonance imaging, MR: Magnetic resonance, FLAIR: Fluid-attenuated inversion recoveryFigure 2: MRI brain of the patient after 3 months of treatment. (a) Axial FLAIR image, (b) axial T1-weighted image, and (c) axial T2-weighted image show no abnormalities of the splenium. MRI: Magnetic resonance imaging, FLAIR: Fluid-attenuated inversion recoveryConsidering the history of road traffic accident under the influence of alcohol with facial trauma associated with mild impairment in consciousness, dysarthria, ataxic gait, and cognitive impairment in a patient with evidence of chronic alcohol use and the classical \"Sandwich Sign\" on MRI, the important differentials which considered were traumatic brain injury, Wernicke's encephalopathy, and MBD. The history of trauma associated with mild impairment of consciousness and orientation pointed toward a structural abnormality such as an extradural/subdural hematoma or intracerebral hemorrhage and diffuse axonal injury, but these were ruled out by the initial CT scan and MRI brain. The background of chronic alcohol intake over the last 7 years and the presence of the classical \"Sandwich sign\" on MRI, however, tilted the scales in the favor of possible MBD. In case of chronic alcoholics, Wernicke's encephalopathy needs to be considered; it presents with milder symptoms of cognitive dysfunction and a speedy recovery as compared to MBD. It further can be distinguished on MRI by the symmetrical involvement of the thalamus, hypothalamus, brain stem, and periaqueductal gray matter.[4] An absence of relapsing-remitting symptoms and absent periventricular white matter lesions on MRI excluded the diagnosis of Multiple sclerosis.[5] Studies suggested that B1-hypovitaminosis is the pathophysiology of the disease. Hence, early replenishment of thiamine may improve outcomes in MBD patients. Studies have shown that early initiation of treatment within 14 days of onset of symptoms with high-dose thiamine and multivitamins has proven to be statistically beneficial as compared to delayed treatment.[4] Better outcomes noted in MBD patient with parenteral administration of thiamine compared to oral administration might be due to delayed intestinal absorption and deranged hepatic uptake associated with chronic alcoholism.[6] In conclusion, MBD, though a rare clinical entity, is potentially reversible with an early diagnosis and prompt initiation of high-dose thiamine and supportive care along with adequate rehabilitation as seen in our patient.

      "title": "Determining Brain Death: Basic Approach and Controversial Issues",
      "abstract": "Between 15% and 30% of patients admitted to intensive care units are comatose at some point during their admission as a result of primary neurologic (trauma, stroke, meningitis, neoplasm, seizures) or systemic (cardiopulmonary arrest, toxins, sepsis, metabolic derangements) problems.1 Comatose patients have grossly impaired brain function that renders them unconscious. Although some comatose patients recover, others reacquire minimal environmental awareness (a minimally conscious state), transition to being in a vegetative state, or progress to death.2 Patients who become vegetative have a complete lack of awareness of themselves and their environment, but have sleep-wake cycles and variable preservation of cranial nerve function. After a month of being vegetative, a patient is described as being in a persistent vegetative state, and if there is a high degree of clinical certainty that the condition is irreversible, the patient is deemed to be in a permanent vegetative state.3 Patients who are comatose, have absent brainstem reflexes, and are unable to breathe spontaneously are brain dead and are legally dead throughout the United States.4–6Similar to the general public, nursing students do not have a good understanding of the difference between coma, a vegetative state, and brain death.7–9 Although nurses in intensive care units are exposed to brain death, they, too, often do not understand the concept of brain death and the process of brain death determination.10 Because management of patients with catastrophic brain injuries who are being evaluated for brain death in the intensive care unit can be both medically and ethically challenging, it is imperative for critical care nurses to have a firm understanding of brain death and the controversies that can arise during and after determination of brain death.The American Academy of Neurology (AAN) created guidelines for determination of brain death in adults in 1995 and updated them in 2010.6,11 The AAN requires that a single examination be performed to determine that a patient is comatose, has no brainstem reflexes, and is unable to breathe spontaneously.Before conducting a brain death evaluation, it is necessary to confirm that (1) there is an irreversible and proximate cause of coma according to the medical history and the results of physical examination, neuroimaging, and laboratory testing; (2) drug levels or calculations of drug clearance based on 5 times a drug’s half-life indicate that no sedatives or narcotics are present in the patient’s system (of note, hypothermia or abnormal hepatic or renal function may extend a drug’s half-life); (3) the blood alcohol level is less than 0.08 g/dL; (3) no neuromuscular blocking agents have been administered recently or reversal of paralytic agents has been confirmed by using a train-of-4 test; (4) no severe electrolyte, acid-base, or endocrine derangements are present; (5) the patient’s body temperature is greater than 36°C (this may require the use of a warming blanket); and (6) the patient’s systolic blood pressure is at least 100 mm Hg (this may require the use of vasopressors).Patients who are brain dead have no evidence of responsiveness to painful stimulation of their extremities, supraorbital ridges, or temporomandibular joints but may have spinal reflexes, which can be disconcerting at times (eg, the Lazarus sign, in which a patient appears to grasp for the endotracheal tube spontaneously during apnea testing or with neck flexion).12 Additionally, all brainstem reflexes are absent in brain-dead patients as follows:If a patient meets the prerequisites for a brain death evaluation and is found to be comatose with no brainstem reflexes, apnea testing must be performed to finalize the brain death determination. Before apnea testing, it is necessary to ensure that the patient is normotensive (systolic blood pressure ≥ 100 mm Hg), normothermic (body temperature &gt; 36°C), eucapnic (Paco2 35–45 mm Hg), and adequately preoxygenated (Pao2 &gt; 200 mm Hg; oxygenation on a fraction of inspired oxygen of 1.0 for at least 10 minutes). The AAN guidelines require that, after meeting prerequisites, patients be disconnected from the ventilator for 8 to 10 minutes. During this time, oxygenation is preserved through delivery of 100% oxygen at 6 L/min through an insufflation catheter placed in the endotracheal tube at the level of the carina. If the patient breathes during testing, the procedure is aborted, as the patient is clearly not brain dead. If the patient is unstable during apnea testing (systolic blood pressure &lt; 90 mm Hg, oxygen saturation &lt; 85%, or an arrhythmia develops), the patient should be reconnected to the ventilator and the procedure may be retried when the patient is stable using a T-piece, 10 cm H2O continuous positive airway pressure, and 100% oxygen at 12 L/min. If no evidence of respiratory drive is observed during testing, the patient should be reconnected to the ventilator and a blood sample should be sent for blood gas analysis. If respiratory movements are absent during testing and Paco2 is at least 60 mm Hg or is 20 mm Hg greater than the patient’s prior Paco2 on the repeat blood gas analysis, the apnea test is considered positive (consistent with brain death). If the Paco2 does not increase adequately, the test is inconclusive and may be repeated for 10 to 15 minutes if the patient is hemodynamically stable.If results of the full neurologic examination and apnea testing are consistent with brain death, the patient is declared dead. However, if part of the neurologic examination cannot be completed (eg, in the setting of facial trauma) or if a patient cannot tolerate apnea testing, an ancillary test should be performed to confirm the brain death determination (of note, brain death is a clinical determination and ancillary testing is not a substitute for the clinical evaluation; apnea testing and all portions of the clinical examination that can be conducted must be done and must be consistent with brain death before ancillary testing is performed to confirm the clinical findings). The ancillary tests that the AAN recommends include an electroencephalogram to demonstrate cerebral inactivity or an angiogram or nuclear study to demonstrate lack of intracranial blood flow. Because brain death is a clinical determination, it is important to be aware that no ancillary test is perfect and it is possible to have false-positive or false-negative results.13Guidelines for brain death determination in pediatric patients were written by the American Academy of Pediatrics in 1987 and then updated in conjunction with the Pediatric Section of the Society of Critical Care Medicine and the Child Neurology Society in 2011.5,14 These guidelines are grossly similar to the AAN guidelines for brain death determination in adults except for the following: (1) after an observation period of 24 to 48 hours, 2 examinations and 2 apnea tests should be performed by 2 different physicians (in adults, only 1 examination and apnea test is required and there is no mandatory observation period); (2) systolic blood pressure should be normalized for age (in adults, systolic blood pressure must be ≥ 100 mm Hg); (3) core body temperature should be &gt; 35°C (in adults, body temperature must be &gt; 36°C); (4) sedative and narcotic elimination should be considered, but there is no finite recommendation for the number of half-lives that must pass before a brain death examination can be performed (in adults, at least 5 half-lives must pass after sedative or narcotic administration before a brain death examination can be performed); (5) for an apnea test to be positive, the Paco2 must be at least 60 mm Hg and must be 20 mm Hg greater than baseline (in adults, the Paco2 must be at least 60 mm Hg or must be 20 mm Hg greater than baseline); and (6) ancillary testing may be done if there is uncertainty about the results of the examination or if medication effect interferes with evaluation of the patient (in adults, ancillary testing is done only if apnea testing or a portion of the clinical examination cannot be completed).5,6Because brain dead patients are legally dead, organ support should be discontinued in a reasonably respectful time period after brain death determination. However, it is important to be aware that brain dead patients are candidates for organ donation. Organ procurement organizations (OPOs) should be contacted before the brain death determination in comatose patients if brain death is being discussed or withdrawal of life-sustaining interventions is anticipated. Discussions of organ donation should be initiated with families only by trained OPO personnel, not by members of the treatment team, once the OPO has determined that a patient is a donation candidate. If a family consents to organ donation, hemodynamic support is maintained until organ retrieval can be arranged. Because systemic complications, including neurogenic pulmonary edema, hypotension, arrhythmias, myocardial dysfunction, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and diabetes insipidus, may develop in brain dead patients, it is often necessary to support patients awaiting organ retrieval with dopamine, methylprednisolone, levothyroxine, and vasopressin.15Some controversial aspects of brain death determination include (1) variability in the performance of brain death determinations, (2) management of religious objections to determination of death by neurologic criteria, (3) determination of brain death after therapeutic hypothermia, and (4) determination of brain death for patients on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).Despite clear guidelines on determination of brain death,5,6 institutional protocols for brain death determination vary both within the United States and around the world.16,17 A 2016 review of 508 US hospitals’ protocols for adult brain death revealed variability in prerequisites for a brain death examination, examination requirements, apnea testing requirements, examiner credentials, number of examinations, waiting periods between examinations, indications for ancillary testing, and ancillary tests to perform.16 In a 2015 survey on brain death determination worldwide, only 77% of countries endorsed having institutional brain death protocols, and responses showed variability in examination requirements, apnea testing, and ancillary testing.17Although brain death is widely accepted in the United States and around the world as death on medical, legal, and ethical levels,4,18–21 families sometimes voice religious objections to determination of death by neurologic criteria.22 As a result, 4 states (California, Illinois, New Jersey, and New York) have legal accommodations for families who voice objections to determination of death by neurologic criteria on religious grounds.23 However, other states do not offer legal guidance about management of this situation, and most hospitals do not have protocols that address this scenario. This situation leaves treatment teams bewildered and results in variable management strategies such as continuation of organ support until cardiopulmonary arrest, transfer to other facilities, and discontinuation of organ support without family consent. When these situations arise, management is often affected by fear of lawsuits or media attention.18,24,25Unfortunately, comatose patients with anoxic brain injury after cardiac arrest sometimes deteriorate neurologically despite use of therapeutic hypothermia to optimize neurologic recovery. Determination of brain death can be challenging in this scenario. Webb and Samuels26 described a 55-year-old man who was treated with therapeutic hypothermia and had findings consistent with brain death when examined 24 hours after rewarming. Organ procurement was planned, but when he was taken to the operating room, it was noted that he had regained some brainstem reflexes and thus was not brain dead. It is important to be aware that treatment with therapeutic hypothermia can confound the process of brain death determination, so it is necessary to wait an extended period of time after rewarming to perform a brain death determination in such patients.26When patients require ECMO, the chance of brain death is 10% to 20%.27,28 Performance of apnea testing in this population is complex, controversial, and challenging.29,30Determination of brain death can be both medically and ethically challenging. Critical care nurses must be aware of the intricacies of the determination process to provide adequate care to these patients and support their families. Additionally, critical care nurses should strive to ensure that institutional protocols for brain death adhere to societal guidelines in order to minimize complications and controversies.5,6",

      "abstract": "Febrile seizures are the age-dependent and predictively favorable condition, which is observed in children under 6 years. All febrile seizures are divided into simple (2/3 of all cases), complex and febrile status. Complicated seizuresinclude attacks with focalsymptoms, prolonged and recurring throughout the day. Simple febrile seizures are short, generalized, not repeated. Simple seizures do not harm the child’s neuropsychic development, they do not transform into epilepsy, and do not need chronic prescription of anticonvulsant therapy. A child with normal development and simple febrile seizures does not need an obligatory EEG and MRI of the brain. All the patients of 18 months old or less with the first episode of febrile seizures need to be hospitalized. The risk of recurrence of seizures and their transformation into epilepsy is higher in a child with complex seizures. There is a small group of children with prolonged seizures and / or febrile status, often with neuropsychiatric developmental delay, which needs to be monitored by a neurologist and further examination. Sometimes doctor prescribes long-term anticonvulsant therapy for the children of this group. Febrile seizures can be prevented with special dosage of anticonvulsant drugs quickly reaching a therapeutic concentration in the child’s brain. Febrile seizures are not a contraindication to vaccination and revaccination, attention should be paid in case of DTP vaccination in children with repeated prolonged seizures and / or febrile status. Conflict of interest: The author of this article confirmed the lack of conflict of interest and financial support, which should be reported.",

People with ADHD usually experience the following types of symptoms: (1) Attention means a person may have difficulty staying on task, sustaining focus, and staying organized, and appear not to listen, even when spoken to directly. (2) Hyperactivity means a person may seem to move about constantly, including in situations when it is not appropriate or excessively fidgets, taps, or talks. They may often be on the go, in constant motion, and have trouble playing or doing an activity quietly. (3) Impulsivity means a person may act without thinking or have difficulty with self-control. Impulsive behavior also occurs when their desire for reward is not satisfied or temporarily put on hold. An impulsive person may interrupt others or make important decisions without considering long-term consequences. Those people’s behaviors are more severe, occur more often, and interfere with or reduce the quality of how they function socially at school or in professional life.",

      "abstract": "Abstract We report 19 patients with a previously undelineated neurodegenerative syndrome characterized by episodic acute onset of irritability or neurological deficits between 2 months and 3.5 years of age, followed by steady or intermittent clinical deterioration. Seven children died between 11 months and 14 years of age. Cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows patchy leukoencephalopathy with cavities, and vascular permeability, in actively affected regions. Early lesions affect corpus callosum and centrum semiovale, with or without cerebellar or cord involvement. After repeated episodes, areas of tissue loss coalesce with older lesions to become larger cystic regions in brain or spinal cord. Diffuse spasticity, dementia, vegetative state, or death ensues. Gray matter is spared until late in the course. In some, incomplete clinical or MRI recovery occurs after episodes. The clinical course varies from rapid deterioration to prolonged periods of stability that are unpredictable by clinical or MRI changes. Elevated levels of lactate in brain, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid, abnormal urine organic acids, and changes in muscle respiratory chain enzymes are present but inconsistent, without identifiable mitochondrial DNA mutations or deletions. Pathological studies show severe loss of myelin sparing U‐fibers, axonal disruption, and cavitary lesions without inflammation. Familial occurrence and consanguinity suggest autosomal recessive inheritance of this distinct entity. Ann Neurol 2005;58:929–938",

      "abstract": "Pediatric sleep disorders are quite common and often disturbing to either the patient or the child's family. As the patient matures into adult, sleep disorders continue to be common and an important factor in development, both social and cognitive. Sleep disorders can adversely impact physical and mental health. Nonrestorative sleep can hamper a child's ability to concentrate and control emotions and behavior. Sleep disorders vary among age groups, but most can occur with varying frequency at any age. Several disorders are typically seen only during the first few years of life, including colic, excessive nighttime feedings, and sleep onset association disorder. A number of conditions are common during childhood but begin to improve as the child ages. The non-REM sleep parasomnias, including sleepwalking, confusional arousals, and night terrors, are the most common in the pediatric category. Nightmares are also common in childhood but can occur at any age. Sleep-related breathing disorders including obstructive sleep apnea, central sleep apnea, central alveolar hypoventilation syndrome, and Cheyne-Stokes respirations are not found only in adults but are, in fact, quite common in the pediatric population. While these disorders can occur at any age, treatment options vary substantially by age.",

      "title": "Biologic Aspects of Rumination Syndrome, Eosinophils, and Beyond",
      "abstract": "Rumination syndrome is characterized by repeated regurgitation with re-swallowing or spitting. It is associated with both medical and psychosocial complications. It is a disorder of gut-brain interaction resulting from complex and heterogenous interactions across biologic, psychologic, and social systems. Diaphragmatic breathing to compete with abdominal wall contractions is the current mainstay of treatment but is often only associated with partial improvement and high relapse rates. As such, there is a need to develop other treatments to supplement the current behavioral approach, particularly addressing other targets of therapy as defined within the biopsychosocial model. The purpose of this chapter is to describe current knowledge of the biology of rumination syndrome, suggesting other potential therapeutic targets including both mechanical and immune dysfunction. Frequent coexistence of GERD and functional dyspepsia has been demonstrated in both adults and children with rumination syndrome, and both may be triggers for rumination. Thus, the biology of both is relevant to rumination, and, as such, the biologic mechanisms of both may represent viable treatment targets in rumination syndrome. Immune dysfunction is now highly implicated in other disorders of gut-brain interaction with emerging data implicating a role in rumination syndrome independent of the presence of functional dyspepsia.",

Profoundly affected children commonly develop severe scoliosis with rigid thoracolumbar deformity. Such neuromuscular (NM) scoliosis can worsen reflux and respiratory capacity. It also causes progressive pelvic obliquity with crowding of abdominal contents and increased intra-abdominal pressure. This phenomenon may interfere with healthy weight gain via two mechanisms: decreasing oral food tolerance and inhibiting normal intestinal motility and absorption. We theorize that spinal fusion – the typical treatment for severe NM scoliosis – can partially remedy these causes and result in improved …",

There is a close connection between stress, obesity and diet. This is where the hypothesis of the conducted study was formed, thus we evaluated the relationship between stress and the weight status of our respondents. An average level of stress was recorded, predominant in those with a Body Mass Index (BMI) deviating from the reference values. Increased food intake has been reported in subjects who were under stress. Most of the participants use to eat more under stress situations, and especially carbohydrates, sweets or fatty foods (i.e., tasty food). Dopamine has an important role in the mechanism that stimulates the “reward pathways”, which will lead to neurobiological adaptations. In this context, they can develop food addiction, stimulating food intake in stressful situations in the future.",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Mowat-Wilson syndrome (MWS) is characterized by distinctive facial features (widely spaced eyes, broad eyebrows with a medial flare, low-hanging columella, prominent or pointed chin, open-mouth expression, and uplifted earlobes with a central depression), congenital heart defects with predilection for abnormalities of the pulmonary arteries and/or valves, Hirschsprung disease or chronic constipation, genitourinary anomalies (particularly hypospadias in males), and hypogenesis or agenesis of the corpus callosum. Most affected individuals have moderate-to-severe intellectual disability. Speech is typically limited to a few words or is absent, with relative preservation of receptive language skills. Growth restriction with microcephaly and seizure disorder are also common. Most affected people have a happy demeanor and a wide-based gait that can sometimes be confused with Angelman syndrome. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of MWS is established in a proband with classic dysmorphic facial features and developmental delay / intellectual disability and/or a heterozygous pathogenic variant in ZEB2 identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Care by the appropriate specialist for dental anomalies, seizures, ocular abnormalities, congenital heart defects, chronic constipation, Hirschsprung disease, genitourinary abnormalities, and pectus anomalies of the chest and/or foot/ankle anomalies; educational intervention and speech therapy beginning in infancy. Surveillance: Annual eye examination in childhood to monitor for strabismus and refractive errors; monitoring for otitis media; regular developmental assessments to plan/refine educational interventions; periodic reevaluation by a clinical geneticist. Genetic counseling MWS is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by a pathogenic variant in ZEB2, a heterozygous deletion of 2q22.3 involving ZEB2, or (rarely) a chromosome rearrangement that disrupts ZEB2. Almost all individuals reported to date have been simplex cases (i.e., a single occurrence in a family) resulting from a de novo genetic alteration; rarely, recurrence in a family has been reported when a parent has a low level of somatic or presumed germline mosaicism for a MWS-causing pathogenic variant. Individuals with MWS are not known to reproduce. Once the causative genetic alteration has been identified in the proband, prenatal testing may be offered to parents of a child with MWS because of the recurrence risk associated with the possibility of parental mosaicism or a balanced chromosome rearrangement.",

We wish to develop this idea to prove that eclampsia is a distinct disease, with a definite pathologic picture, that at times convulsions prove the constant feature, but not invariably so. We may have eclampsia with a typical picture without convulsions. In such cases the eclamptic seizure is manifested (1) by a headache of agonizing, blinding type, in which the patient may become unconscious from the pain; or (2) perhaps as a burning substernal pain, which is, in our experience, an almost constant feature",

      "title": "SIGNIFICANCE OF POSTSTROKE URINARY INCONTINENCE AS A NEGATIVE PREDICTOR OF FUNCTIONAL RECOVERY ON THE BASIS OF AGING",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: Multiple and interactive factors contribute to development of urinary incontinence (UI), especially in geriatric stroke patients. Stroke is one of the neurological disorders that causes detrusor hyperreflexia, which is generally manifested clinically as urge incontinence.1 Impairment of bladder contractility can accompany urge incontinence in frail elderly patients. Such patients have involuntary detrusor contractions yet must strain to empty their bladders, either incompletely or completely. These patients have symptoms of obstruction and stress incontinence in addition to elevated postvoid residual volume (PVR).2 In addition, chronic impairments of physical and cognitive functioning may cause urine loss, a condition commonly termed functional incontinence.3 Incidence of poststroke urinary incontinence (PSUI) and the effect of PSUI on functional outcome on the basis of aging was assessed in 163 subjects with stroke consecutively admitted (65 women, 98 men; mean age 64.8, mean time from onset to rehabilitation 15.0 weeks, mean length of stay 4.8 weeks) to two separate rehabilitation centers affiliated with the same university. Chi-square tests were performed to define significance between different groups and to determine odds ratios in assessing the predictive value of UI for successful rehabilitation in different patient groups. Indwelling catheters were removed for several hours to determine whether a voiding trial might be effective in eliminating the indwelling catheters. Subjects who could not manage voiding and who developed urinary retention were catheterized. Patients who were able to respond to simple questions regarding toileting were potential candidates for determination of PVR to exclude overflow incontinence. If PVR was more than 100 cc, patients were catheterized. Catheters were removed from the patients who could empty their bladders successfully. The patients who were unable to respond to questions regarding toileting needs were tested for PVR, and if their bladders were emptied successfully (PVR<100 cc), they were not catheterized but were left with diapers on. Successful functional level was defined as a total Functional Independence Measure score greater than 80 at discharge.4 Patients with indwelling catheters and diapers were defined as incontinent. Incidence of PSUI in the study group was 39.3%. Incidence of PSUI in patients with aged 75 and older (55.5%) was significantly higher than it was in patients younger than 75 (P<.01). Evidence of PSUI was a strong negative predictor for stroke rehabilitation outcome in all age groups. The predictivity was highest in patients with aged 65 to 74 and lowest in the youngest patient group (<55). Results of the statistical studies are summarized in Table 1. Many studies have reported that PSUI is the most important negative predictive factor for functional recovery in stroke.5–9 It is most probable that evidence of PSUI is a result and a reason for bad prognosis. It is a fusion of many common negative predictors such as poor cognition, severe cerebral involvement, comorbid diseases attacking the autonomic nervous system, immobilization, and old age. PSUI is also a causative factor for inadequate hygiene, decubitus ulcers, infections, and malnutrition. These are the facts that make PSUI the most significant negative prognostic clinical factor for stroke outcome. Age of 75 and older was another significant factor for the evidence of PSUI, and for this particular age group, functional UI might have complicated the situation and increased the rate up to 55.5%.

      "abstract": "A esclerose múltipla remitente-recorrente (EMRR) é uma doença neurológica autoimune, onde o sistema imunológico ataca a bainha de mielina do sistema nervoso central, causando inflamação que prejudica a transmissão dos impulsos nervosos. Caracteriza-se por episódios de surtos com exacerbação dos sintomas, como fadiga, fraqueza em membros inferiores e superiores, tremores e equilíbrio dificuldade para andar, perda de visão, entre outros, seguidos de remissões com recuperação parcial ou completa, que podem durar meses ou anos, durante os quais a progressão da doença é mínima ou ausente. A insônia ou baixa qualidade de sono pode ocorrer indiretamente como consequência da EMRR. Ou seja, um sintoma secundário que é acarretado pela presença dos sintomas específicos da doença e dos pseudo surtos. A Percepção Corporal (PC) pode ser definida de duas maneiras, como Imagem Corporal (IC) e Esquema Corporal (EC). A IC está relacionada ao aspecto psíquico, emocional, cognitivo, sociocultural, evolucionário, genético e neurocientífico, em relação a expectativa da imagem de seu corpo. O EC é a perspectiva que possibilita, por meio de mecanismos cinestésicos e proprioceptivos, o reconhecimento do corpo anatômico e da relação que este estabelece com o meio e com os objetos a sua volta. Diante destas definições, surgiu a oportunidade para relacionar a qualidade de sono com a percepção corporal e os quadros sintomatológicos. Sendo assim, o objetivo do estudo foi analisar a relação entre a qualidade do sono e a percepção corporal, pelo aspecto do esquema corporal e os quadros sintomatológicos da esclerose múltipla. Participaram 18 pessoas, entre 21 e 67 anos, que foram avaliados quanto à qualidade do sono pelo questionário de Pittsburgh, à percepção corporal pelo Teste de Askevold, e aos sintomas por meio de uma entrevista estruturada. Os resultados indicaram que todos os participantes com sono adequado foram classificados como hiperesquemáticos, enquanto 67% dos que apresentaram sono inadequado foram classificados como hipoesquemáticos. Além disso, indivíduos com sono inadequado mostraram uma distribuição equilibrada entre sintomas motores e sensitivos, enquanto aqueles com sono adequado relataram predominantemente sintomas sensitivos. A fadiga foi um sintoma relevante em 67% dos indivíduos com sono inadequado. Esses achados sugerem que a qualidade do sono pode estar associada à percepção corporal e à manifestação dos sintomas na EMRR, destacando a importância de intervenções que melhorem o sono para o manejo dessa condição.",

Following an attack of acute demyelinating optic neuritis (ON), there is a risk of developing multiple sclerosis (MS) especially if one or more periventricular demyelinating white-matter lesions is seen on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain. Early treatment of MS with immunomodulatory drugs may helpful after ON. Other inflammatory demyelination syndromes such as neuromyelitis optica (NMO) and NMO spectrum disorder (NMOSD) or myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) syndrome may mimic MS and can present with acute optic neuritis. In contrast to MS related ON however, bilateral, anterior, and/or recurrent ON is more likely to occur in NMO or MOG syndromes.",

Lack of REM sleep is associated with anxiety and excitability, as well as difficulty with concentration and memory. The prevalence of most sleep disorders increases with advancing age. This chapter discusses the disorders most commonly encountered in this population. Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is often accompanied by periodic limb movements of sleep (PLMS). Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is characterized by repetitive episodes of sleeprelated upper airway obstructions, which usually are associated with oxygen desaturation. A special situation of abnormal sleep disorders in the elderly is degenerative diseases. Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), multiple systems atrophy (MSA), and prion diseases all pose different challenges and disruptions to sleep. Care must be taken in selecting medications. Whenever possible, associated medical or psychiatric conditions should be treated.",

Although the human brain has a considerable potential for plasticity, any breakdown in this plasticity may be key to pathogenesis for Alzheimer’s or neurovascular disease. Five to ten percent of the population aged 65 and older show dementia, as does approximately fifty percent of people over 85. For highly accomplished individuals, the first sign of cognitive deterioration is an increase in the time and effort needed to carry out a task. The diagnosis of dementia is based on: 1) a history of persistent and progressive decline; 2) cognitive scores in one or more tests that fall beyond 2 SD’s from age and education-matched ranges; 3) change in scores that exceed 1 SD within a 6-12 month test/retest period; 4) scores below 36 in the Mini-mental State Exam are considered abnormal; 5) patients should be retesting in 12-18 months.

In addition to the physiological impairment this causes, increasing doses of narcotics can lead to mental and emotional impairment, all of which can significantly reduce a person's quality of life (1).

A food-dependent form of exercise-induced ­anaphylaxis also exists, in which symptoms develop only if the patient has eaten in the hours immediately preceding exercise. In most patients with the food-dependent form, only a specific food(s) will elicit symptoms when combined with exercise, and patients usually have demonstrable IgE to this food. Attacks of exercise-induced anaphylaxis are unpredictable. Management of these disorders involves teaching the patient to stop exercise immediately at the first sign of symptoms and preparing them to self-administer intramuscular epinephrine if needed. Depending on the role of food, patients may need to avoid the culprit food for 4–6 h before exercise, remove the food from their diet altogether, or avoid ingesting any food for several hours before exercise. Pharmacotherapy to prevent attacks has been generally disappointing, although some patients with the food-dependent form may be helped by oral cromolyn, taken before meals. Most patients report fewer attacks over time.",

      "abstract": "Veel mensen in onze samenleving leiden aan regelmatige slaapproblemen of hebben gewoonweg niet voldoende tijd voor slaap. Wanneer slaapgebrek een chronisch probleem wordt zouden er wel eens veranderingen in hersenen en lichaam kunnen optreden die ernstige gevolgen hebben voor de psychische en fysieke gezondheid. Zo is er vaak gesuggereerd dat verstoorde slaap kan bijdragen aan het ontstaan van stemmingsstoornissen als depressie. In dit proefschrift worden studies beschreven naar de neurobiologische gevolgen van chronische slaaptekort in ratten. De dagelijkse hoeveelheid slaap werd tot minder dan de helft gereduceerd en in de weken daarna werden de gevolgen bestudeerd voor hersensystemen en hormonale processen die mogelijk betrokken zijn bij depressie. Hoewel een enkele dag van slaaptekort nog geen effecten had op deze systemen, waren er na een week al duidelijk veranderingen meetbaar in de gevoeligheid voor de neurotransmitter serotonine en in de regulatie van de hypofyse-bijnier as, het hormonale systeem dat betrokken is bij de reactie op stress. Na een maand van slaaptekort traden er zelfs morfologische veranderingen op in het brein. Er was een duidelijke afname in de grootte van de hippocampus, een hersengebied dat een belangrijke rol speelt bij de regulatie van emoties en cognitieve processen. Veel van de waargenomen neurobiologische en hormonale veranderingen na chronisch slaaptekort in ratten komen sterk overeen met afwijkingen die zijn vastgesteld bij depressieve patienten. De resultaten van deze studies leveren dan ook een sterke ondersteuning van de hypothese dat verstoorde slaap niet enkel een symptoom is van depressie maar, bij een deel van de patienten, mogelijk een causale rol speelt bij het ontstaan van de stemmingsstoornis.",

      "abstract": "Gastric and intestinal dyspepsia are classified based on the predominant symptoms. Symptoms of gastric dyspepsia include heaviness and discomfort in the epigastrium, early satiety, belching, heartburn, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, etc. Symptoms of intestinal dyspepsia include flatulence, rumbling, diarrhea, constipation, and unstable stool. Furthermore, intestinal dyspepsia is classified as putrefactive or fermentative mostly on the basis of coproscopy data. The symptoms of putrefactive dyspepsia include elevated pH and organic acid and ammonia levels in the stool. The symptoms of fermentative dyspepsia include decreased stool pH and elevated levels of starch, fiber, and iodoform bacteria. The symptoms of biliary dyspepsia include bitter taste in the mouth, loss of appetite, various stool disorders, a feeling of discomfort, heaviness, and distension in the right hypochondrium. The duodenum is acknowledged as the “director” of the digestive organs’ symphony. The pancreas, stomach, gallbladder, and small and large intestines are the “musicians” in this symphony. The duodenum is a special module that facilitates the change from acidic stomach digestion to slightly alkaline intestine digestion with intensive processing of chyme by intestinal enzymes, the pancreas, and bile acids. The pathophysiology of the duodenum’s linkages to other digestive organs, as well as the etiology of gastric, intestinal, and biliary dyspepsia in chronic pancreatitis, are all thoroughly explored in this article. Separate consideration is given to the pathophysiology of dyspepsia in biliary chronic pancreatitis as well as the primary strategies for curing it. The author substantiated the expediency of administering the enzyme preparation of non-animal origin, Panzest, and emphasized its advantages for treating dyspepsia in patients with chronic pancreatitis. The advantages of the release form of Panzest (“capsule within a capsule”) are pointed out. They ensure the release of enzymes in the stomach with continued hydrolysis of nutrients in the duodenum.",

      "abstract": "A series of 33 patients with combined (injurious) sleepwalking, sleep terrors, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (viz. \"parasomnia overlap disorder\") was gathered over an 8-year period. Patients underwent clinical and polysomnographic evaluations. Mean age was 34 +/- 14 (SD) years; mean age of parasomnia onset was 15 +/- 16 years (range 1-66); 70% (n = 23) were males. An idiopathic subgroup (n = 22) had a significantly earlier mean age of parasomnia onset (9 +/- 7 years) than a symptomatic subgroup (n = 11) (27 +/- 23 years, p = 0.002), whose parasomnia began with either of the following: neurologic disorders, n = 6 [congenital Mobius syndrome, narcolepsy, multiple sclerosis, brain tumor (and treatment), brain trauma, indeterminate disorder (exaggerated startle response/atypical cataplexy)]; nocturnal paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, n = 1; posttraumatic stress disorder/major depression, n = 1; chronic ethanol/amphetamine abuse and withdrawal, n = 1; or mixed disorders (schizophrenia, brain trauma, substance abuse), n = 2. The rate of DSM-III-R (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, 3rd edition, revised) Axis 1 psychiatric disorders was not elevated; group scores on various psychometric tests were not elevated. Forty-five percent (n = 15) had previously received psychologic or psychiatric therapy for their parasomnia, without benefit. Treatment outcome was available for n = 20 patients; 90% (n = 18) had substantial parasomnia control with bedtime clonazepam (n = 13), alprazolam and/or carbamazepine (n = 4), or self-hypnosis (n = 1). Thus, \"parasomnia overlap disorder\" is a treatable condition that emerges in various clinical settings and can be understood within the context of current knowledge on parasomnias and motor control/dyscontrol during sleep.",

Criteria have not yet been established for the diagnosis of FAE, but there is consensus that the diagnosis requires deficiencies in two of the above categories and a history of maternal alcohol abuse (1-4). \r\n\r\nPrenatal alcohol exposure has also been linked to cardiac anomalies, urinary and kidney anomalies, neural tube defects, cleft lip with or without cleft palate, gastrointestinal and genital abnormalities, dental anomalies, limb and joint abnormalities, scoliosis, ptosis, strabismus, epicanthal folds, microphthalmia, myopia, short up-turned nose, broad or low nasal bridge, low set ears and rotated ears (10-12). \r\n\r\nRenal structural anomalies of FAS include cross-fused ectopia, renal hypoplasia and urethropelvic junction obstruction have been reported in children with FAS (10,12). More recent clinical and experimental studies have also shown that fetuses exposed to ethanol perinatally have a number of renal functional abnormalities, including impairment in renal acidification and potassium excretion as well as a defect in urinary concentrating ability, even in the absence of any structural abnormalities (13-15). The scanning electron microscopy examinations of the rat kidney following fetal exposure to alcohol, showed mitochondrial swelling and cytoplasmic vacuolation of the epithelial cells of the distal nephron, suggesting the possibility of alcohol induced renal tubular cell injury (16). Assadi and Ziai also reported that offspring of alcoholic mothers particularly those children with FAS have lower plasma zinc levels and that the urinary excretion of zinc is increased in these infants, suggesting a direct relationship between urinary losses and lower plasma zinc levels (17). \r\n\r\nIt is estimated that approximately 5% of all congenital birth defects are attributable to prenatal alcohol exposure across the globe (18-20). Estimates for the incidence of full-blown FAS, is 8 for every 1,000 live births, while that for FAE range from 10-30 per 1,000 live births (18-20). It is estimated that 110,000 newborns annually are affected by alcohol. Cost estimates for FAS/FAE are exorbitant. It is also estimated that 12% of the annual cost for all institutional care for the mentally retarded patients, in the Western communities, are for individuals with FAS/FAE (21). \r\n\r\nDespite the wide spread incidence, FAS remains to be difficult to diagnose clinically, and difficult to research. The clinical features may not be readily obvious and individually are not specific to only FAS (6,9,22). The neonatal period is the most difficult to diagnose FAS. In the neonate the facial dysmorphic feature is subtle, often obscured by periorbital or general facial edema. Mental retardation and developmental impairment may not be evident for several years. Throughout gross specific clinical features can vary. No single feature is found in every case. Also, there exists some overlap between FAS and other syndromes. A history of alcohol abuse in pregnancy is often under reported or denied. Physicians tend to under diagnose FAS either due to lack of familiarity with the syndrome or a reluctance to place a label with negative social connotations. \r\n\r\nThe most distressing consequence of prenatal alcohol exposure is the central nervous system damage (7,8). The affected newborn may exhibit poor sucking, tremulousness, unusual body posturing, abnormal reflexes, and disturbed sleep patterns. The older infant demonstrates measurable decrements in mental and motor development, poor visual recognition, memory and decreased expressive and receptive language. Affected preschoolers demonstrate decreased IQ scores, attention deficits, delayed reaction time and decrements in fine and gross motor performance. The school aged child has decreased achievement scores, is easily distracted, learning disabled, shows poor organization and cooperation and has a rigid approach to problem-solving (7,8). Adolescents and adults with FAS have an average IQ of 65 with a range from 20 to 90. Those with FAE have an average IQ of 80, ranging from 40 to 100 (1-6). Despite higher IQ scores, individuals with FAE generally have achievement test scores similar to those with full FAS. In general, more physical manifestations are associated with poorer intelligence. However, there is a wide overlap in the ranges and the degree of brain damage is not always directly proportional to the severity of physical malformations, making it difficult to predict intelligence on an individual basis. Adolescents and adults exhibit a wide variety of behavioral problems, including impulsivity, social withdrawal and anxiety. Most have problems in adaptive living, lacking judgment and problem-solving skills. Few adults with FAS or FAE are self-sufficient. \r\n\r\nThe identification of renal dysfunction and zinc deficiency in FAS is important from a prognostic point of view and to permit adequate and comprehensive management of patients with this syndrome. \r\n\r\nPrevious studies have shown that birth defects that result from prenatal zinc deficiency are likely caused by a defect in DNA and protein synthesis (23-25). It is also known that zinc deficiency can lower the activity of alcohol dehydrogenase in multiple organs of alcoholic patients (26). \r\n\r\nBecause zinc plays an important role in DNA synthesis and current data are inconclusive, it is possible that alcohol-induced zinc deficiency may contribute to alcohol related birth defects observed in FAS (17). This possibility remains a reasonable hypothesis and requires further study. \r\n\r\nAlcohol induced organ damage arises not only from the direct effects of alcohol on tissues but also from the metabolism and the metabolites of alcohol. Recent investigations have focused on assessing the direct effect of alcohol versus acetaldehyde toxicity, the role of nutrition with impaired placental function and synergic effects of nicotine and caffeine (26). More specifically, mechanisms for FAS involving altered protein synthesis and hypoxemia have been considered (26). Class I and Class II alcohol dehydrogenases are the enzymes that are primarily responsible for initial degradation of alcohol, acetaldehyde, in humans. It has been found that acetaldehyde can cross the human placenta from the maternal to the fetal compartments. Toxic aldehydes generated in this initial degradation step are further oxidized by aldehyde dehydrogenases. It seems likely that genetic variation in alcohol metabolism may lead to differences in the propensity of individuals to develop alcohol induced organ damage. With DNA probes, it will now be possible to assess the role of alcohol metabolizing enzymes in the development of organ damage. \r\n\r\nAs to a specific mechanism by which alcohol may impair fetal growth and development, impaired protein synthesis, abnormal delivery or regulation of glucose in the fetus, altered zinc metabolism, and hypoxia are key considerations under investigation. Better understanding of the mechanism involved may permit more meaningful therapeutic intervention. \r\n\r\nThe timing of alcoholic exposure is also crucial (22). The most crucial period for anatomic abnormalities is early in the first trimester, which includes the time segment preceding pregnancy recognition. The third trimester appears to be the most vulnerable period for overall gross and central nervous system development. Intrauterine growth retardation cannot be detected by ultrasonography until approximately 27 weeks gestation. \r\n\r\nFAS/FAE is particularly tragic because it is totally preventable, simply through abstinence from alcohol during pregnancy. It is the responsibility of health care professionals, social and government agencies to protect the unborn child from the devastating effects of alcohol. The most effective weapon for prevention of FAS is education which targets every non-pregnant of childbearing age (27,28). Pregnant women who are identified to use alcohol should be intensively counseled to discontinue further alcohol consumption. Although this will not reverse any damage already produced, at least any further damage is prevented. \r\n\r\nIdentification of women at risk is often difficult. Simple questioning can be unreliable because of poor recall or denial. Since direct questioning regarding alcohol can be intimidating, questionnaires may be developed for assessment of risk. Hopefully through continued educational efforts, we will successfully imprint the awareness that alcohol consumption during pregnancy is unacceptable.",

Las características clínicas más frecuentes incluyen alteraciones cognitivas, mioclonías y crisis epilépticas. Actualmente su diagnóstico es menos frecuente desde que se eliminó el aluminio de los líquidos para diálisis; sin embargo, se han descrito casos esporádicos donde persiste la correlación entre la terapia dialítica, la intoxicación con aluminio y las alteraciones neuropsiquiátricas, con fuentes de intoxicación como aguas poco tratadas. Presentamos el caso: paciente femenino de 57 años, cuyo familiar refirió enfermedad actual desde 1 mes previo a su ingreso al hospital, después de recibir terapia hemodialítica, inicia de forma progresiva e insidiosa, desorientación en tiempo y espacio, a la que se asoció cambios bruscos del humor con episodios de ira inmotivados, asociándose progresivamente alteración de la memoria, y se agregan movimientos involuntarios, continuos, reptantes, amplios, en 4 extremidades, por lo que es evaluada por servicio de neurología. Al examen de las funciones mentales superiores, se encontró desorientada en tiempo y espacio, bradipsíquica, hipertímica displacentera con tendencia a la depresión, lenguaje hablado fluente, articulado, incoherente, comprendía órdenes sencillas de forma ambígua, no denominaba, no repetía. Presentó movimientos de flexo-extensión, repetitivos, en miembros superiores e inferiores, bilaterales, amplios, sinuosos hacia la línea media, sugestivos de movimientos coreatetósicos. Entre los resultados de pruebas de laboratorio resaltan niveles de aluminio sérico en 136±7ugr/l, con valores normales de 1-5ug/l. La demencia postdialítica es inusual en la actualidad, gracias a la mejora en los líquidos de diálisis, que contienen cantidades mínimas de sales de aluminio. Sin embargo; se conoce que la sangre de los pacientes en hemodiálisis se expone de 60 a 90 litros de agua en cada tratamiento. En caso de enfermedad renal, la fijación del aluminio a las proteínas plasmáticas es elevada, por lo que la captación de aluminio será importante incluso en los casos en los que la concentración del metal en el líquido de diálisis sea pequeña. Aunque la incidencia de demencia postdialítica ha disminuido, se ha demostrado que los pacientes con enfermedad renal crónica, presentan predisposición a acumular aluminio en los tejidos corporales, por disminución en su excreción renal, siendo frecuente su acumulación en la corteza cerebral. El tratamiento se basa en la administración de quelantes como la desferrioxamina",

      "abstract": "An epileptic seizure is a “transient occurrence of signs and/or symptoms due to abnormal excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain.” Epilepsy is a disorder of the brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures and by the neurobiological, cognitive, psychological, and social consequences of this condition. The widely accepted operational definition of epilepsy requires that an individual have at least two unprovoked seizures on separate days, generally 24 hours apart. An unprovoked seizure refers to a seizure that occurs in the absence of an acute brain insult or systemic disorder. This nosology is based on the observation that while a single unprovoked seizure is often an isolated event that does not recur during an individual’s lifetime, two unprovoked seizures rarely occur in isolation and are associated with high risk of the individual experiencing more seizures. In some cases, such as when the seizure occurs in the setting of a potentially epileptogenic brain insult such as an episode of encephalitis or a traumatic brain injury (TBI), it is possible to recognize the specific form of epilepsy at its earliest presentation. In such cases, the diagnosis of epilepsy can be made after the very first unprovoked seizure. Based on its definition, epilepsy is not a single disorder but rather a syndrome or syndromes. Different forms of epilepsy syndrome(s) have different causes, different manifestations, different implications for short- and longterm management and treatment, and different outcomes.",

The most common forms of pica are geophagia or soil consumption and pagophagia or ice consumption. Similar to other medical symptoms such as fever and anemia, pica is a symptom caused by multiple factors, being iron and zinc deficiencies the most frequent associations, where the physician, rather than treat it, must identify the intimate cause which is associated with, and correct it, as is possible in most cases of pica. Pica, despite being a symptom, according to the type and intensity, can cause morbidity and mortality. Among the complications associated with pica are electrolyte disorders, obstruction and damage of the digestive tract by some types of pica, such as geophagy and trichophagia, and pica of foreign objects such as plastics and velcro. Its diagnosis, which only consists in questioning this practice to patients or their caregivers, in the case of children and patients with mental illness, is usually ignored in the care of patients, most likely due to ignorance of the health team about this disorder, or lack of time during the medical consultation.

      "abstract": "Stress, a state of threatened homeostasis, may be induced by various physical or psychological factors (stressors), including antigenic stimulation. Stressful experiences may affect both physical/psychological well being and immune functioning of humans and animals; the ongoing immune reaction may affect other physiological functions and psychological comfort. The molecular basis of these effects involves a network of multidirectional signalling and feedback regulations of neuroendocrine- and immunocyte-derived mediators. The consecutive stages of the multistep immune reactions might be either inhibited or enhanced owing to the previous and/or parallel stress experiences, depending on the kind of stressor and the animal species, strain, gender, or age. Therefore, the final results of stress-induced alteration of immune reactions are difficult to predict. The effect of a particular stressor on immune functions varies according to the previous stress experience of the individual (e.g. social confrontation, sterile saline injection) while various stressors may act in the same or in opposite ways on the same immune parameter. In general, the efficacy of immune response depends on the neuroendocrine environment on which it is superimposed. Conversely, neural and endocrine responses depend on the concurrent immune events upon which they are superimposed. It seems that the consequences of stress on the immune functioning are generally adaptive in the short run but can be damaging when stress is chronic.",

Thus, neonatal motor behaviour is unsuitable as a basis for an estimate of conceptional age in small-for-gestational-age infants of toxaemic mothers. In the infants in this study the abnormal motor behaviour was not due to symptomatic hypo-glycaemia, neonatal asphyxia, or any other overt postnatal illness. The maturation of the fetal nervous system was adversely affected by maternal toxaemia and intrauterine malnutrition. In the same infants of toxaemic mothers bioelectric brain maturation wad frequently retarded and/or abnormal. The consistently abnormal EEG phenomena could—if at all—only exceptionally be explained by perinatal hypoxia or postnatal hypoglycaemia and they occurred in the absence of any other overt postnatal illness.

Insomnia Disorder can be diagnosed when insomnia symptoms are recurrent (>3 times a week), persistent (> 3 months), cannot be attributed to sleep-disrupting circumstances, and impair daytime functioning. Insomnia Disorder affects approximately 10% of the population and tends to persist over months or years. Insomnia Disorder severely reduces the quality of life and carries an increased risk of severe, long-lasting health problems, including cardiovascular and mood disorders. Given its high prevalence, persistence and impact on health, it is highly important to study the pathophysiology of Insomnia Disorder during wakefulness and sleep. Overall, the study of the endogenous EEG dynamics in Insomnia Disorder revealed that hyperarousal of the central nervous system occurs not only during sleep but also during wakefulness. During wakefulness, Insomnia Disorder is characterized by stronger cortical oscillations in a broad beta band and by increased cortical sensitivity to cardiac activity. Furthermore, people with more severe insomnia complaints show stronger Long-Range Temporal Correlations of the amplitude fluctuations of cortical oscillations; which is consistent with a weaker inhibitory bias in the cortical balance between excitation and inhibition. During sleep, the shallow and more fragmented sleep that characterizes Insomnia Disorder may particularly involve N2 instability. Resolving the causal relationship between sleep fragmentation and excitation/inhibition balance is the next key-step in the understanding of the pathophysiology of Insomnia Disorder.",

      "abstract": "The progressive myoclonus epilepsies (PMEs) are a devastating group of rare disorders(1) that manifest with increasing action myoclonus, which is also present at rest but activates with stimuli such as noise, light, or touch. Ultimately, patients become wheelchair-bound and experience early death. Neurologic signs that frequently but not reliably coexist include other seizure types (particularly generalized tonic-clonic), progressive ataxia, and dementia. Typically, presentation is in late childhood or adolescence; however, all ages may be affected. Although distinction from more common forms of genetic generalized epilepsy, particularly juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, may be challenging early on, the presence or evolution of 1) progressive neurologic disability, 2) failure to respond to antiepileptic drug therapy, and 3) background slowing on EEG should suggest PME. Importantly, inappropriate therapy in the genetic generalized epilepsies may result in ataxia, impaired cognition, and uncontrolled seizures, which may mimic PME. PMEs should be distinguished from progressive encephalopathies with seizures (due to degenerative conditions such as GM2 gangliosidosis, nonketotic hyperglycinemia, Niemann-Pick type C, juvenile Huntington and Alzheimer disease) and progressive myoclonic ataxias, which affect predominantly adults with progressive ataxia, myoclonus, few if any tonic-clonic seizures, and without evidence of dementia.(2,3.)",

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is by far the most common acquired demyelinating disease, and in chronic MS, the failure of repair results in marked debilitation and morbidity. Severe debility is also seen in Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD), a rare X-linked disorder that results from a mutation in the proteolipid protein (PLP) gene (1). Affected males may live into their second or third decade with a practically amyelinated CNS. In acquired myelin disorders, such as MS, remyelination occurs early in the course of the disease, yet may be incomplete, and the relapsing nature of the disease results in chronic demyelination. The failure of complete and lasting repair in MS is in contrast to the peripheral nervous system where Schwann cells have a much greater ability to remyelinate axons following extensive demyelination.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This chapter examines the risk factors for constipation in the terminally ill patient, as well as explores the underlying pathophysiology of constipation in the setting of advanced illness. Normal bowel function requires coordination of gut motility with molecular transport across the bowel wall and reflexes of defecation. Disruption in any of these areas can affect normal bowel function. Unfortunately, in the setting of advanced illness, these factors are often disrupted. Patients nearing end of life often require medications to manage common symptoms related to terminal illness which often affect normal bowel function, adding another layer to consider when dealing with the patient’s constipation. Careful assessment, including history and physical examination, will be reviewed as they are needed to identify the best course of management. In certain situations, investigations and imaging may be required in order to better identify the cause. Many terminally ill patients are on opioids near end of life which are a class of medications notorious for causing constipation. This chapter will review the current evidence and management options for opioid-induced constipation, including a newer class of medications—the peripherally acting mu opioid receptor antagonists (PAMORAs).",

Diperlukan waktu 6-8 jam perhari agar mendapatkan kualitas tidur yang baik. Insomnia merupakan persepsi atau keluhan atas kualitas tidur yang buruk ditandai dengan kesulitan memulai tidur, mempertahankan tidur, dan terbangun terlalu dini di pagi hari yang dapat menyebabkan kelelahan, kecemasan, kurang konsentrasi, hingga depresi yang dapat mengganggu aktifitas harian. \r\nData prevalensi insomnia sangat beragam di indonesia 10% dari total penduduk mengalami gangguan sulit tidur atau insomnia dan 15% diantaranya adalah kasus insomnia kronis. Insomnia sendiri diklasifikasikan ke beberapa hal. Berdasarkan waktu insomnia terbagi menjadi insomnia transien, insomnia jangka pendek, dan insomnia kronis, sedangkan berdasarkan etiologinya insomnia dibedakan menjadi insomnia primer dan insomnia sekunder.\r\nDalam TCM insomnia dapat diakibatkan karena defisiensi Qi jantung dan kandung empedu yang bisa diakibatkan karena pola hidup yang kurang baik, terlalu lama menderita penyakit, atau mengkonsumsi obat terlalu sering sehingga dapat menguras Qi dan darah. Penanganan insomnia dapat dilakukan menggunakan terapi kombinasi pijat swedia, tuina dan nutrisi olahan daun kelor. Pemberian pijat kombinasi adalah untuk memberikan efek relaksasi dan memanipulasi langsung kedalam titik akupuntur sedangkan pemberian nutrisi olahan daun kelor sebagai asupan tambahan sehingga insomnia dapat berkurang. Terapi pijat dilakukan menggunakan teknik swedia pada seluruh tubuh dan teknik tuina pada beberapa titik akupuntur seperti Jueyinshu (BL14), Xinshu (BL15), Pishu (BL20), Weishu (BL21), Shenshu (BL23), Fengchi (GB20), Jianjing (GB 21), Yintang (EX-HN3), Taiyang (EX-HN5), Shenting (GV24), Jingming (BL1), Cuanzhu (BL2), dan Sibai (ST2) yang dilakukan 21 kali terapi.

Sleep issues may affect children differently than adults, and distinct treatment approaches are often used in children.Sodium oxybate was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in October 2018 for an expanded indication of treatment of sleepiness or cataplexy in patients with narcolepsy type 1 or narcolepsy type 2 aged 7 years or older, with side effect and safety profiles similar to those seen in adults. Restless sleep disorder is a recently proposed entity in which restless sleep, daytime sleepiness, and often iron deficiency are observed, but children do not meet the criteria for restless legs syndrome or periodic limb movement disorder.Children's sleep is discussed in this article, including normal sleep patterns and effects of insufficient sleep. Sleep disorders of childhood are reviewed, including insomnia, obstructive sleep apnea, restless legs syndrome, parasomnias, narcolepsy, and Kleine-Levin syndrome. Children with neurologic issues or neurodevelopmental disorders frequently have sleep disorders arising from an interaction of heterogeneous factors. Further attention to sleep may often be warranted through a polysomnogram or referral to a pediatric sleep specialist. Sleep disorders may cause indelible effects on children's cognitive functioning, general health, and well-being, and awareness of sleep disorders is imperative for neurologists who treat children.",

      "title": "Mémoire et faux souvenirs",
      "abstract": "Auteur(s) : Pascale Piolino La memoire episodique est definie comme la memoire des evenements personnellement vecus et situes dans leur contexte temporel et spatial d’acquisition. L’un des aspects les plus inattendus de cette forme de memoire est l’existence de faux souvenirs. Ce phenomene designe le rappel d’evenements qui n’ont jamais eu lieu. En effet, les dysfonctionnements de la memoire episodique n’impliquent pas uniquement des deficits d’encodage, de recuperation ou des oublis, mais egalement des faux souvenirs qui se manifestent par exemple par des intrusions et des fausses reconnaissances dans les epreuves classiques de memoire episodique tel le test de Grober et Buschke. Si les recherches se sont surtout centrees sur l’etude des symptomes negatifs (deficit de rappel ou de reconnaissance d’une information etudiee) qui accompagnent les desordres mnesiques lies aux pathologies cerebrales, un interet croissant se porte depuis ces dernieres annees a l’etude des symptomes positifs (faux rappel ou fausse reconnaissance, confabulations). Differents travaux ont etudie l’effet de l’âge sur les faux souvenirs. La creation de faux souvenirs augmente-t-elle avec l’âge ? Et, dans l’affirmative, quelles sont les causes de cet effet avec l’âge ? Ce sont les questions que pose Martin Lovden [1] a partir d’un paradigme experimental utilise pour susciter des faux souvenirs chez les sujets sains, afin d’etudier les mecanismes impliques dans la creation de faux souvenirs. Le « Deese-Roediger-McDermott paradigm » [2], « paradigme DRM », consiste en la presentation de listes composees de mots semantiquement lies (par exemple, les items : lit, repos, eveille, fatigue, reve, sommeiller, reveil, couverture...) qui convergent vers un meme theme ou un item non presente (dormir) appele item critique. Les sujets normaux, jeunes et âges, ont tendance a rappeler ou identifier ce mot non presente dans un test de rappel libre ou de reconnaissance. Ainsi, les sujets sains creent des intrusions et des fausses reconnaissances sur les items critiques. Ces faux souvenirs resulteraient d’une confusion de la source d’apprentissage entre l’information generee personnellement par le sujet, qui realise une association avec l’item critique, et l’information externe reellement encodee. Une autre theorie postule que la creation de ces faux souvenirs proviendrait du type d’encodage qui privilegie l’idee generale des mots de la liste au detriment de leur specificite. L’etude de Lovden a ete realisee chez 146 sujets âges de 20 a 80 ans testes avec le paradigme DRM, deux autres tâches suscitant des intrusions semantiquement liees et des tâches complementaires evaluant respectivement la memoire episodique, la vitesse de traitement et les capacites d’inhibition. Les resultats confirment les travaux anterieurs en mettant en evidence une augmentation des faux souvenirs (intrusions et fausses reconnaissances critiques) avec l’âge. Les resultats des analyses statistiques suggerent que l’accroissement des faux souvenirs serait directement lie aux deficits de memoire episodique et pas a une diminution des capacites d’inhibition. Ce resultat est interessant dans le sens ou il semble demontrer que les faux souvenirs sont intrinsequement dependants du fonctionnement de la memoire et non de celui d’un facteur plus general lie aux capacites d’inhibition et donc au fonctionnement executif. Cependant, il demande a etre replique car d’autres etudes suggerent, a l’inverse, que le phenomene des faux souvenirs lie au vieillissement s’expliquerait par un dysfonctionnement executif. En parallele, plusieurs etudes se sont penchees sur le phenomene des faux souvenirs dans la maladie d’Alzheimer (MA) en utilisant le paradigme DRM. Les resultats varient selon les etudes : ils montrent que les patients realisaient plus ou moins de fausses reconnaissances critiques par rapport aux sujets âges. Certaines etudes ont trouve que ces fausses reconnaissances avaient une frequence identique a celles des sujets âges controles chez les patients a un stade leger de la maladie, mais que leur frequence etait inferieure pour les patients a un stade plus avance [3]. Une des hypotheses suggere que la degradation des connaissances semantiques chez les patients atteints de MA ne permettrait pas d’activer l’item critique en reponse a la presentation de la liste de mots semantiquement associes, d’ou une diminution du nombre de fausses reconnaissances critiques par rapport aux sujets âges. La seconde hypothese postule que cette baisse pourrait egalement resulter d’une difficulte a trouver le « point commun » d’une meme liste en raison de deficits attentionnels classiquement observes dans la MA. Cette hypothese est en accord avec l’augmentation des fausses reconnaissances critiques chez les patients lorsque les conditions d’encodage sont facilitees. Ces deux hypotheses sont aujourd’hui discutees dans divers articles sans pouvoir apporter clairement des arguments permettant de privilegier l’une ou l’autre. Ces travaux presentent l’interet de faire le lien entre la neuropsychologie des amnesies et l’etude des distorsions de la memoire chez le sujet sain. Au-dela, l’etude des faux souvenirs souleve la question particulierement delicate et passionnante de la frontiere entre le normal et le pathologique dans la distorsion des souvenirs, puisque tout souvenir contient une part de deformations et que c’est un phenomene normal. Cette imprecision depend non seulement de l’anciennete du souvenir, mais aussi de l’etat de celui qui se souvient et qui reconstruit son souvenir au gre de ses interets, de ses croyances et de ses desirs presents. Ainsi, le souvenir est, par essence, une reconstruction plus ou moins approximative de la realite. Les faux souvenirs ne sont donc pas l’apanage des patients souffrant de troubles de memoire car ils peuvent etre observes chez les sujets sains dans la vie quotidienne et meme devenir dangereux lorsqu’ils occasionnent, par exemple, des faux temoignages. Etudier ces distorsions mnesiques s’avere etre d’un interet multiple, puisqu’elles permettent de donner des informations sur le fonctionnement normal de la memoire et sa fragilite. 1. Lovden M.

      "title": "Restlessness and an Increased Urge to Move (Drive for Activity) in Anorexia Nervosa May Strengthen Personal Motivation to Maintain Caloric Restriction and May Augment Body Awareness and Proprioception: A Lesson From Leptin Administration in Anorexia Nervosa",
      "abstract": "Anorexia nervosa (AN), a disorder of voluntary food restriction leading to severe weight loss in female adolescents, remains an enigma. In particular, the appropriation of the starved thin body into the self-concept in AN is a process insufficiently researched and still poorly understood. Healthy humans undergoing starvation experience a slowing of movements and avoid voluntary exercise. By contrast, AN tends to be not infrequently associated with voluntary, sometimes excessive and/or compulsive exercise. Such deliberate exercise, not reported in starvation, seems to be facilitated by an increased urge for movement and physical restlessness, particular to AN. The increased urge to move would reflect spontaneous daily activity, the energy expended for everything that is not sleeping, eating, or voluntary exercise. Our hypothesis is that the starvation-induced increased urge to move and restlessness may promote the development of AN. Reversal of the fasting state, by either high caloric food or by leptin administration, would be expected to reduce restlessness and the increased urge to move along with improvement in other symptoms in AN. This review explores the idea that such restless activation in AN, in itself and through accelerating body weight loss, might foster the integration of the starving body into the self-concept by (1) enhancing the person’s sense of self-control and sense of achievement and (2) through invigorating proprioception and through intensifying the perception of the changing body shape. (3) Tentative evidence from studies piloting leptin administration in chronic AN patients which support this hypothesis is reviewed. The findings show that short term administration of high doses of leptin indeed mitigated depressive feelings, inner tension, intrusive thoughts of food, and the increased urge to be physically active, easing the way to recovery, yet had little influence on the patients’ personal commitment to remain at a low weight. Full recovery then requires resolution of the individuals’ personal unresolved psychological conflicts through psychotherapy and frequently needs specialized treatment approaches to address psychiatric co-morbidities. AN might be conceptualized as a hereditary form of starvation resistance, facilitated by the effects of starvation on fitness allowing for an exceptionally intense personal commitment to perpetuate food restriction.",

      "abstract": "The heterogeneity among patients with obesity is particularly evident in the weight loss response to interventions such as diets, drugs, devices and surgery. Obesity can be “catalogued” into four phenotypes: hungry brain (abnormal satiety for alteration of gut–brain axis), emotional hunger (hedonic eating), hungry gut (abnormal duration of satiety for faster gastric emptying) and slow burning (slowing of the metabolic rate). Phenotypes are grafted onto this complexity, the recognition of which allows for personalized medicine and increasingly targeted therapies. Although there are no standardized treatment protocols, we present management options consisting of lifestyle modifications and pharmacologic therapies. Nutritional advice and encouragement of adequate physical activity lead to increased self-efficacy and promote a sense of well-being when coupled with psychological approaches involving mindful eating. In summary, obesity has a complex pathophysiology best addressed through a therapeutic process suited to the phenotype encountered and in synergy with multifactorial interventions.",

      "abstract": "Acute febrile encechalopathy is a common condition leading to hospital admission in adults and children in India. CNS infections are commonest cause of nontraumatic coma in children. 1 Encephalopathy- a diffuse disease of brain that alters its structure or functionmay be caused by variety of infective, metabolic, toxic, ischemic/hypoxic, nutritional causes or trauma. In febrile illnesses, encephalopathy may result from pathogenic mechanisms affecting nervous system directly or systemic complications like hypoglycemia, hypovolemia, hyperpyrexia, hypoxia, anemia, hepatic/ renal failure and bleeding may contribute to its pathogenesis. The physician/ intensivist is faced with the challenge of emergency management, identification of cause and its treatment not only to ensure survival but also to prevent long-term sequelae, neurological or otherwise. Few of such important clinical situations need elaborate consideration. Encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain parenchyma, presents as diffuse and/or focal neuropsychological dysfunction. From an epidemiologic and pathophysiologic perspective, encephalitis is distinct from meningitis, though on clinical evaluation the two often coexist (meningoencephalitis) with signs and symptoms of meningeal inflammation, such as photophobia, headache, or a stiff neck. Cerebritis describes the stage preceding abscess formation and implies a highly destructive bacterial infection of brain tissue, whereas acute encephalitis tends most commonly to be a viral infection with parenchymal damage ranging from mild to profound. Post monsoon Japanese Encephalitis (JE) epidemics have been reported from Uttar Pradesh, Assam and other parts of the country. JE is the single largest cause of viral encephalitis in world today. The incidence has been reported to be high among pediatric age group with high mortality (30%). 2 Persistent EEG abnormalities are common in children. Brain CT and MRI scans reveal low density areas and abnormal signal intensities in the thalamus, basal ganglia which correlate with clinical findings of tremor, rigidity and abnormal movements that are common in the acute phase of illness. Diagnosis may be established by serological tests and JE virus-specific IgM antibody or RT-PCR in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Since there is no specific anti-viral therapy for JE as of today (Ribavirin is under trial), the treatment is mainly symptomatic and supportive. However, reducing the raised intracranial pressure and controlling convulsions may decrease the mortality and morbidity significantly. No satisfactory treatment exists for the relatively common acute arboviral encephalitides, which vary in epidemiology, mortality and morbidity, if not clinical presentation. Dengue virus encephalopathy is a rare but recognized cause of acute febrile encephalopathy in India and usually occurs in febrile stage. Neurological findings reported in association with dengue include mononeuropathies, polyneuropathies and Guillain Barre’s Syndrome. Around 1-4% of all dengue admissions have clouding of consciousness. Variety of pathological processes like hypotension, cerebral edema, microvascular or frank haemorrhage, hyponatremia and fulminant hepatic failure may interact to cause coma in some of these patients but in others where no such process is identified, isolation of dengue virus from CSF or brain tissue has endorsed the concept of dengue virus itself leading to encephalitis. 3 Clinically distinguishing these acute arboviral encephalitis from the two potentially treatable acute viral encephalitis – a) herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE), which is a sporadic and lethal disease of neonates and the general population as well, and b)",

A variety of medical and psychiatric factors may also produce marked sleep disruption. All of these factors are in this chapter. A recent randomised double-masked placebo-controlled trial in children with neurodevelopmental disorders showed that melatonin reduced sleep onset latency but at the same time was associated with earlier waking time than placebo. Melatonin is not generally considered to produce tolerance, rebound insomnia or dependency, problems often associated with other sedative hypnotics. The chapter explains the use of antidepressants and antipsychotics. The misalignment of the internal sleep-wake circadian clock with environmental day/night patterns and other environmental cues may also result in sleep disorders.",

Many of these will yield a history consistent with, and similar to their present endocrine status, which can be traced back to early life before the onset of alcoholism. Some spouses, of drinking alcoholics, succumb to the unremitting emotional stress and develop the cortical insufficiency syndrome. The incidence of the syndrome in cosanguinous relatives suggests that it is hereditary.(4) Adrenal cortical insufficiency must be differentiated from muscular dystrophy, disease of a psychic basis, chronic brucellosis etc. A positive blood culture is necessary before the latter can be diagnosed.(11) (11A) Bacteriological cure can leave hypoadrenocorticism even if its existence prior to infection did not render the patient susceptible through immunity failure.(9) Present methods of treatment would yield greater success if endocrine homeostasis could simultaneously be achieved through carbohydrate withdrawal combined with the other measures described. Contented maintenance of abstinence would then be rendered easier.",

      "title": "Excitotoxicity, Synaptic Repair, and Functional Recovery in the Mammalian Cochlea: A Review of Recent Findings",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT: Besides its fast excitatory properties, glutamate is known to have neurotoxic properties when released in large amounts or when incompletely recycled. This so‐called excitotoxicity is involved in a number of acute and/or degenerative forms of neuropathology such as epilepsy, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, stroke, and retinal ischemia. In the cochlea, excitotoxicity may occur in two pathological conditions: anoxia and noise trauma. It is characterized by a two‐step mechanism: (1) An acute swelling, which primarily depends on the AMPA/kainate type of receptors, together with a disruption of the postsynaptic structures (type I afferent dendrites) resulting in a loss of function. Within the next 5 days, synaptic repair may be observed with a full or a partial (acoustic trauma) recovery of cochlear potentials. (2) The second phase of excitotoxicity, which may develop after strong and/or repetitive injury, consists of a cascade of metabolic events triggered by the entry of Ca 2+ , which leads to neuronal death in the spiral ganglion. Ongoing experiments in animals, tracking the molecular basis of both these processes, presages the development of new pharmacological strategies to help neurites to regrow and reconnect properly to the IHCs, and to prevent or delay neuronal death in the spiral ganglion. Human applications should follow, and a local (transtympanic) strategy against cochlear excitotoxicity may, in the near future, prove to be helpful in ischemic‐ or noise‐induced sudden deafness, as well as in the related tinnitus.",

The delusions concern experiences that can conceivably occur in real life, such as being followed (persecutory type), having a disease (somatic type), being loved at a distance (erotomanic type), having an unfaithful sexual partner (jealous type), and possessing inflated worth, power, identity, or knowledge (grandiose type). The diagnosis requires at least 1 month's duration of the delusion; impact on functioning that is consistent with the delusion or its ramifications; generally normal appearance and behavior; and the exclusion of schizophrenia, mood disorder, substance-induced toxicity, and medical disease. Typically, patients are unaware of the psychiatric nature of the condition. They may present to internists, dermatologists, plastic surgeons, lawyers, or the police rather than to psychiatrists. Although the prevalence is low, delusional disorder is not rare. Age at onset is usually middle or late adulthood, and the course is variable. Familial transmission is suspected, and comorbidity (frequently mood disorders) may exist. Successful management is difficult and may include hospitalization, pharmacotherapy, and certain forms of psychotherapy.",

Although each specific condition may be relatively or extremely rare, when they are considered together, many children and adolescents are affected. Health conditions may be characterized by their duration and their severity. Although these terms are often linked, they refer to different aspects of a health condition. A chronic condition is generally one that has lasted or is expected to last more than a defined period of time, usually 3 months or longer. Conditions vary widely in their onset, course, and duration.2 Severity refers to the impact a condition has on a child's physical, intellectual, psychological, or social functioning.3 This impact may occur as a result of persistent symptoms, required treatments, limitations of activity or mobility, or interference with school, recreation, work, and family activities. Current estimates are that between 10 and 20 million American children and adolescents have some type of chronic health condition or impairment.

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONEpilepsy is a neurological disorder affecting 1% of the total population worldwide. In India, the prevalence rate is 5.59 per thousand (Bharucha, 2003). Epilepsy or seizure can be defined as occasional, sudden, excessive rapid and local discharges of grey matter (Jackson, 1873). The clinical manifestation of epilepsy is synapse, drying of mouth, nausea, blurring of vision. The basic mechanism of epilepsy is due to many cellular changes in membrane conductance and neurotransmitter alterations affecting the neuronal interaction.Cognitive deficits are seen in areas of attention, memory and executive functioning. Behavioural and personality disturbances are also present.(Benett, 1992). Circumstantialities are seen in both spoken and written language. Slowness in thinking, poor abstraction and calculation ability are other cognitive deficits seen in epileptic patients. The nature and extent of cognitive deficits depend on seizure type, frequency, age of onset, duration of disorder and the etiology (Benett, 1992).Restoration and reestablishment are the techniques employed for cognitive remediation. Along with it compensatory techniques are also employed. Neuropsychological remediation is used for correcting different facets of cognitive deficits like attention, memory, executive functioning. They have been attempted at hyper-active children, alcoholics and people with psychiatric decomposition.AIMThe aim of the study was to develop and test the efficacy of cognitive remedial measures.HYPOTHESISThere will be significant difference in the pre and post therapy cognitive scores in the various tests.METHODOLOGYDESIGN OF THE STUDYSamplingThe purposive sampling method was taken to collect the sample.

These are rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorders (RBD); restless legs syndrome; periodic limb movement in sleep (PLMS); cataplexy, which manifests itself as sudden falling, head dropping, or jaw dropping due to sudden loss of muscle tone triggered by emotions (laughing in particular); hypnic jerks or hypnagogic myoclonus; fragmentary myoclonus in children; autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy; sleep walking and sleep terrors; head banging, and bruxism (grinding of the teeth). Careful history taking or reviewing a home video provides valuable clues, but the gold standard remains video polysomnography (PSG). Some sleep-related movements do not represent “disorders” as such but are harmless, physiological motor phenomena, and are discussed because of their frequency and relevance in differential diagnostic considerations.",

Thyroid dysfunction, vitamin deficiencies and normal-pressure hydrocephalus are some potentially reversible causes of dementia. Major irreversible causes include Alzheimer's disease, central nervous system damage and human immunodeficiency virus infection.

      "title": "Paediatric Insomnia",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is a prevalent sleep problem, affecting approximately one-third of the children in the general population. Despite its high prevalence, paediatric insomnia is often unrecognized and untreated in clinical practice. It is commonly associated with other neurodevelopmental and psychiatric comorbidities, such as autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). If left untreated, paediatric insomnia may be linked to a constellation of negative impacts in the affected child, including an increased risk of health-related problems (e.g., obesity/overweight, pain, fatigue), psychological issues (e.g., anxiety, depression), interpersonal problems (e.g., poor family relationships, peer problems) and impaired daytime functioning (e.g., poor alertness, impaired school performance), as well as elevated levels of family stress and impaired parental mental health and quality of life. Several factors may contribute to paediatric insomnia, including genetic influence, hyperarousal and hypersensitivity, circadian issues, poor sleep hygiene, comorbid medical conditions, and psychosocial and behavioural factors. A thorough assessment is essential to inform the treatment of insomnia in children and adolescents. Actigraphy can provide a continuous and objective estimation of sleep-wake patterns, and is a useful tool in the assessment of paediatric insomnia. Behavioural interventions are usually recommended as the first-line treatment and there has been limited evidence to support the efficacy and safety of medications for treating paediatric insomnia. The current chapter provides an overview of paediatric insomnia, including the classification and diagnostic criteria, prevalence, consequences, and factors associated with childhood insomnia, as well as its assessment and management.",

      "title": "Effective Treatment Approaches for Eating Disorders in Children and Adolescents: A Review Article",
      "abstract": "Eating disorders are serious psychiatric illnesses marked by disordered behaviors toward food and eating due to dissatisfactory body shape and weight, which impact the physical and psychological growth of children and adolescents. This review aims to recognize the effectiveness of psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy in treating eating disorders. The most common type of eating disorder is anorexia nervosa characterized by severe restriction of energy intake and an intense fear of gaining weight. Bulimia nervosa is characterized by episodes of binging and purging followed by compensatory behaviors. Binge eating disorder is characterized by binging without compensatory behaviors. Avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder is characterized by a lack of interest in eating unrelated to weight and shape concerns. Depending on the severity of the condition, patients could be treated as an inpatient, partial hospitalization, or outpatient treatment using different psychotherapies, including family-based therapy, psychodynamic individual treatment, cognitive behavioral therapy, adolescent-focused therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy, or a combination of both. Studies in children and adolescents show that family-based therapy is considered the first-line treatment for anorexia nervosa, and the second evidence-based approach is adolescent-focused therapy. As for bulimia nervosa, both family-based treatment and cognitive behavioral therapy are almost equally effective. In binge eating disorder, cognitive behavioral therapy and interpersonal psychotherapy are the most beneficial psychotherapies. For avoidant-restrictive food intake disorder, psychotherapy or hospitalization could be considered. Concerning pharmacotherapy, none of the medications have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for children and adolescents.",

Virtually pathogmonic symptoms include re-experiencing the event through play and ceaselessly repeated behaviors (re-enactments), cognitive distortions when relating the facts (chronological errors, belief in omens), changes in attitudes towards others and life in general, and neurovegetative hyperactivity (hypervigilance, startle responses, difficulties controlling impulses). Although adequate follow-up data are lacking, the disorder can probably become chronic in children, as in adults. This nosographic entity raises the theoretical issue of the roles of life events and individual vulnerability. A number of factors may either \"predispose\" or \"protect\" the child: degree and duration of exposure to the trauma, nature of the event, preexistence of psychiatric disorders, level of cognitive development, sex, degree of social support, and containing or noncontaining attitude of the family. Treatments advocated in adults (pharmacotherapy, cognitive and behavioral therapies, group therapy) remain to be used and evaluated in children.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia impairs daytime functioning or causes clinically significant daytime distress. The consequences of insomnia, if left untreated, may contribute to the risks of developing additional serious conditions, such as psychiatric illness, cardiovascular disease, or metabolic issues. Furthermore, some comorbidities associated with insomnia may be bidirectional in their causality because psychiatric and other medical problems can increase the risk for insomnia. Regardless of the serious consequences of inadequately treated insomnia, clinicians often do not inquire into their patients' sleep habits, and patients, in turn, are not forthcoming with details of their sleep difficulties. The continuing education of physicians and patients with regard to insomnia and currently available therapies for the treatment of insomnia is, therefore, essential. Insomnia may present as either a difficulty falling asleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, or waking too early without being able to return to sleep. Furthermore, these symptoms often change over time in an unpredictable manner. Therefore, when considering a sleep medication, one with efficacy for the treatment of multiple insomnia symptoms is recommended. A modified-release formulation of zolpidem, zolpidem extended-release, has been approved for the treatment of insomnia characterized by both difficulty in falling asleep and maintaining sleep. Here, we review studies supporting the use of zolpidem extended-release in the treatment of sleep-onset and sleep maintenance difficulties.",

      "abstract": "This particular group of children recovering from tuberculous meningitis have suffered a significant degree of intellectual impairment. It appears that the factor having the most unfavorable influence in intellectual recovery is severe clinical illness as evidenced by convulsive seizures. Loss of consciousness for some time during the early phase of tuberculous meningitis in itself does not appear to be a highly unfavorable sign. Nevertheless, when unconsciousness is associated with convulsive seizures the intellectual functioning of the patient, in most instances, can be expected to be seriously impaired. An infant with tuberculous meningitis may be expected to have an unfavorable prognosis aside from any other factors. An older child, who has remained conscious throughout his illness and without convulsions, may be expected to have a relatively good prognosis. Adverse social factors, prolonged hospitalization and isolation, and sensory-motor sequelae are considered to have influenced unfavorably the psychometric scoring of many of these children. Repeat psychometric testing, after an interval, reveals that still further improvement in intellectual functioning may be expected in a number of these children who do not have serious sensory-motor impairment. For the majority, however, repeat testing reveals that they have varied little from their previous performance; the normal children continuing to develop within their normal group whereas the retarded children have remained retarded. It is noteworthy that observations on five adults treated at the Alexandra Hospital have been at some variance with the observations of Williams and Smith who found no measurable disturbance of intellect, personality or memory in 19 adult patients. Three of the five adults treated in this unit have obvious changes in personality in that they are unable to concentrate as formerly, are easily frustrated, childish and frequently quick-tempered. The remaining two patients appear to have no apparent intellectual or personality sequelae. Although this is a study of a small number of children, it is hoped that other workers will undertake psychometric evaluation of children recovering from tuberculous meningitis and make their results known for comparison.",

      "abstract": "Tinnitus is the perception of sound in the absence of corresponding external sound(s). Tinnitus can be perceived in one or both ears or in the head. It is usually described as an unpleasant noise, but in some patients it takes the form of a ringing, buzzing, hissing, humming, or whistling sound, or as ticking, clicking, roaring, tunes, songs, or beeping. It is estimated that 1 out of every 5 people experience some degree of tinnitus. Tinnitus is not itself a disease but an unwelcome symptom. It can be accompanied by audiometric evidence of deafness which occurs in association with both conductive and sensorineural hearing loss resulting from a range of underlying causes, including ear infections, foreign objects orwax in the ear, and injury from loud noises. Tinnitus is also a side-effect of some metabolic disorders, medications, and may also result from an abnormally low level of serotonin or high level of insulin. As mentioned above, some foods are found by some people to make their tinnitus worse. The inner ear, like the brain, is totally lacking in energy reserves. Its metabolism depends directly on the supply of oxygen and glucose from the blood supply. Alterations in glucose metabolism therefore have great potential for disturbing the workings of the inner ear. Because tinnitus is often defined as a subjective phenomenon, it is difficult to measure using objective tests. Although there is no specific cure for tinnitus, those affected can learn techniques to successfully manage their tinnitus to the point where it is no longer a problem for them.",

      "abstract": "Persistent postural-perceptual dizziness (PPPD) is a common cause of dizziness and vertigo. This term was first described fairly recently by the International Classification of Vestibular Disorders in 2017. The symptoms include unsteadiness, vertigo or dizziness, lasting at least 15 days per month for 3 months or longer. The symptoms are exacerbated by upright posture, standing, walking or in the presence of various visual stimuli. The cause of this disorder is still unknown, although it is believed that it is related with the discoordination of the peripheral sensory and the central nervous systems. The onset of dizziness has been explained as the result of failure of integrating visual, vestibular and proprioreceptive signals into the central nervous system. The symptoms are often succeeding a previous vestibular disorder, e.g. vestibular neuronitis, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), Ménière’s disease or other disorders. Psychological factors also play a part in the onset of PPPD – patients quite frequently present a history of anxiety, neurotic tendencies and depression. PPPD diagnosis is clinical, a thorough anamnesis and clinical examination are crucial. In order to diagnose PPPD correctly, a set of all five criteria, established by the Bárány society, should be met. The treatment is usually multimodal, consisting of vestibular rehabilitation, cognitive behaviour therapy, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI).This review describes the term of PPPD, the symptoms of the disease, epidemiology, etiology, pathogenesis, comorbidities, also the diagnostic criteria and treatment of PPPD. The purpose of this article is to educate about this disease and to encourage more research, as well to seek better care for patients, accomplished by a multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals.",

      "title": "[Neurologic follow-up of the premature infant with very low birth weight].",
      "abstract": "The most recent studies on premature infants with low birth weights (less than 1500 grams) and extremely low birth weights (less than 1000 grams), other than confirming the spectacular drop in mortality in these subjects, have evaluated their neuropsychic development and the extent of the handicaps over the long term. The major handicaps (cerebral paralysis, mental retardation) have considerably decreased in the survivors, if one makes exception for cases with birth weights less than 750 grams (which present sequelae in high percentages, even if reported differently in the few works published). Minor handicaps (neuropsychological and behavioral defects) are maintained on relatively high levels (20-30% of subjects that survive). There is no doubt that the handicaps of these children may in large part be lead back to ischemic cerebral injuries and/or hemorrhages, well documented today in their evolution from neuroradiological technologies. The mechanism of neurological damage is, however, complex, both in its origin and in its development. Other factors contribute to this as well, among which environmental conditions seem to have an importance that can't be ignored. This applies especially for minor handicaps, which clearly predominate in premature infants of less advantaged social classes. At any rate, the neuropsychic development of premature infants with low birth weights is very individualized and difficult to predict, also because there is still much uncertainty about the value of neonatal prognostic indexes. In the course of the first year of life, neuromotor anomalies can be detected that then spontaneously disappear. In other cases, a more delayed recuperation, even if partial, can be obtained with delays in neuromotor development.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

      "abstract": "A compulsão alimentar periódica (TCAP) é um transtorno alimentar caracterizado por episódios recorrentes de ingestão descontrolada de grandes quantidades de alimentos, acompanhados por sentimentos de perda de controle. Sua etiologia é multifatorial, envolvendo fatores genéticos, ambientais e neurobiológicos. O diagnóstico do TCAP baseia-se nos critérios do DSM-5 e do CID-11, considerando a frequência e a gravidade dos episódios. No entanto, o transtorno frequentemente não é identificado ou tratado adequadamente, o que contribui para seu curso crônico e suas comorbidades associadas, como obesidade e transtornos psiquiátricos. O tratamento inclui abordagens psicoterapêuticas, principalmente a Terapia Cognitivo-Comportamental (TCC), associadas, em alguns casos, à farmacoterapia com antidepressivos e psicoestimulantes. O manejo deve ser multidisciplinar, visando não apenas a redução dos episódios compulsivos, mas também a melhora na qualidade de vida e na regulação emocional dos pacientes. A identificação precoce e o desenvolvimento de novas estratégias terapêuticas são essenciais para otimizar os desfechos clínicos e reduzir o impacto do TCAP na saúde mental e física dos indivíduos.",

      "abstract": "The multidisciplinary guideline 'Diagnostics and treatment of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)' provides the basis for a properly coordinated collaboration between the patient suffering from IBS and all healthcare providers involved in his or her treatment, such as the general practitioner, gastroenterologist, internist, occupational-health physician, dietitian and psychologist. The diagnosis 'IBS' is often made in accordance with diagnostic criteria, such as the Rome III criteria, but a somatic condition needs to be excluded first. If there are no indications for this, additional diagnostic tests are not necessary. Management of the condition consists primarily of advice on life-style plus non-pharmacological interventions, in addition to explaining the condition and providing information. Drug treatment is rarely indicated. If the IBS symptoms have a significant impact on quality of life and patients do not respond to the measures taken in accordance with this general policy, there are three options for psychotherapeutic treatment. When the symptoms result in absenteeism or other work-related problems, the doctor can advise the patient to contact the occupational-health physician and to search for specific solutions in consultation with the employer. When individual advice is required or if the patient's diet is not well-balanced, a referral to the dietitian will follow.",

Brain, like other parts of the body, needs to maintain homeostasis to function properly, and that requires continuous removal of toxic wastes. Brain possesses specific waste disposal system. The glymphatic system serves as a brain waste disposal system. BBB also facilitates the efflux of toxic metabolites out of the brain.The brain’s waste consists of metabolites, and proteins such as amyloid- beta, tau and alpha- synuclein proteins etc., which can form aggregates that are deleterious to brain. Sleep deprivation , aging and many other brain pathologies (i.e. stroke, ischemia, tumour, injury etc.) may disrupt glymphatic function. Some non-pharmacological therapeutic modalities such as exercise, sleep, sleeping posture, intermittent fasting and dietary regimens (omega-3 fatty acids, resveratrol etc.) are powerful drivers of glymphatic transport. Unani herbal drug, Ustukhuddus (Lavandula stoechas L.) is also used for istifragh-e-dimagh or tanqiya-e-dimagh in Unani System of Medicine since long time.This review addresses current scientific knowledge regarding understanding and significance of Istifragh-e-dimagh with special reference to prevention and / or treatment of chronic neurodegenerative diseases.",

Anterograde amnesia arose within a 1-month period and has persisted for more than 1 year. Although a wide variety of neurological and neuroradiological assessments were completed (EEG, evoked potential recordings, Doppler sonography, MRI, PET), no evidence of brain damage was detected. Neuropsychologically, the patient was of high intelligence, had average to above-average short-term memory, and normal retrograde memory abilities, but severe and persistent anterograde amnesia in both verbal and nonverbal domains. Furthermore, he demonstrated grossly reduced long-term concentration.

      "title": "Cerebral reorganization after sensorimotor stroke",
      "abstract": "Stroke can interfere with every single capacity of the human brain. Many patients experience transient deficits that disappear within 24 hours (Hennerici et al., 1988) or suffer from slight or moderate hemiparesis that regresses completely within a couple of days (Donnan et al., 1991; Duncan et al., 1992). Of the patients with severe completed stroke, approximately 50% recover from hemiparesis (Heinemann et al., 1987; Gresham et al., 1998). In most of these patients, recovery takes place within the first four weeks after infarction, usually starting with shoulder and synergistic arm–hand movements (Donnan et al., 1991; Duncan et al., 1992; Katrak et al., 1998). In subcortical infarctions, functional restoration may be slower, continuing over several years (Fries et al., 1993; Manto et al., 1995). This suggests that a variety of mechanisms may be involved in the restoration of motor functions after brain infarction. Also, clinically undetected white matter changes and the prevalence of silent stroke lesions in patients presenting with the symptoms of acute stroke affect the cognitive and attention state of patients and their capacity to recover (Kase et al., 1989; Sultzer et al., 1995; van Zagten et al., 1996). Therefore, the challenging aspect in each stroke patient is the question to what degree he or she will recover. To monitor recovery, the importance of an adequate assessment of the functional deficit and of the disability level of daily activities has increasingly been recognized (Duncan et al., 2000), since correlation with the tissue perfusion state, the recruitment of peri-lesional and remote areas during functional activation, and changes of cortical excitability, as assessed with transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), will provide the basis for an evaluation of the recovery mechanisms and of the efficacy of new therapeutic interventions that have been or will be introduced into clinical use.",

      "abstract": "Nocturia, waking up at night to urinate, is a highly prevalent disorder in the elderly with a profound impact on life expectancy, health and quality of life. It interacts negatively with sleep and is associated with increased daytime sleepiness. In particular, waking up three or more times a night to void is related to a steep increase in sleep disturbances. Giddiness, both at night and during the day, is another common consequence, since in three out of four cases, nocturia can be attributed to nocturnal urine overproduction, causing a negative fluid balance. Fall injuries are the most important risk associated with nocturia. Nocturia may be attributable not only to nocturnal polyuria, but also to a diminished nocturnal bladder capacity, or both. Treatment may include diuretics (taken in the afternoon instead of in the morning), vasopressin analogs (desmopressin) at bedtime or antimuscarinic drugs to improve nocturnal bladder capacity.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Schizoaffective disorder was first described in the literature by Kasanin in 1933, referring to a group of patients in whom both psychotic (“schizo”) and mood (“affective”) symptoms are prominent features. A formal diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder requires that (1) a mood episode (major depressive, manic, or mixed) co‐occurs with active schizophrenia symptoms; (2) hallucinations or delusions have occurred for at least 2 weeks in the absence of prominent mood symptoms; (3) the mood symptoms are present for a substantial portion of the total active and residual phases of schizophrenia; and (4) the symptoms are not related to the direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition. Schizoaffective disorder can be further broken down into two subtypes: depressive type (if the mood component consists of only major depressive episodes) and bipolar type (if a manic or mixed episode is part of the mood component). Because loss of interest or pleasure also resembles another common symptom of schizophrenia (i.e., anhedonia), the other essential feature of a major depressive episode, pervasive depressive mood, must be present in the depressive type of schizoaffective disorder.",

Their general occurrence is reflected in phrases like “it makes me sick” and “to sweat with fear”. In some groups of people these autonomic disturbances are not confined to stressful situations but become more general and frequent and so more disabling. For instance, in patients with affective illnesses, symptoms of autonomic origin are common and are relieved by successful treatment of the underlying illness. Again, there is a group of patients who complain of these symptoms but who show little affective disorder. In these patients the autonomic symptoms are provoked by specific situations which are not particularly stressful to normal people, e.g. nausea occurs when eating in company or diarrhoea when travelling; outside these specific situations symptoms do not occur. Although these patients may complain of some anxiety, the physical symptom is the major complaint and the anxiety is often attributed to this.",

      "abstract": "Millions of patients are afflicted by a variety of sleep disorders. Sleep can be measured electrophysiologically and described in terms of nonrapid eye movement (NREM) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, with REM sleep being dream sleep. Overall, sleep is a cyclic phenomenon, showing a 90-minute periodicity. Sleep disorders are divided into four groups: disorders of initiating and maintaining sleep, disorders of excessive somnolence, disorders of the sleep-wake schedule, and the parasomnias. The parasomnias include sleepwalking, sleep terror, and nightmares. The classic disorders of excessive somnolence include obstructive sleep apnea (an impairment of respiratory function during sleep) and narcolepsy (a genetically transmitted dysregulation of REM sleep). Insomnia may be either transient (eg, associated with jet lag, work shift change, or a disturbing or exciting situation) or chronic (eg, associated with psychiatric disorders or periodic leg movements during sleep). Hypnotics are generally reserved for the treatment of transient or short-term insomnias. Although a number of hypnotics are available, the benzodiazepines are currently accepted as the drugs of choice; selection within the group is based primarily on differences in pharmacokinetic profiles. The practicing pharmacist has the opportunity to play an important role in assessing, recommending treatment, or recommending further evaluation for the many patients who present with insomnia or excessive daytime sleepiness.",

Management for suspected concussion begins with immediate removal from play and requires clinical follow-up. Symptoms are usually self-limited and resolve within 2 to 3 weeks. Initial treatment consists of a reduction in cognitive activity and physical rest. A stepwise return-to-play protocol, taking into consideration state laws, with a gradual increase in activity until the athlete is able to perform full activity without symptoms should be followed. Neuropsychologic testing may be used as a tool in management. For prolonged concussion, physical rehabilitation or medications for headaches, mood, or sleep disturbance may be required. Education, rule changes, and equipment improvements may assist in prevention. The long-term consequences of concussions are not fully understood and merit additional research.",

      "title": "Charles Bonnet Syndrome Treated With Pimavanserin",
      "abstract": "Visual hallucinations can arise with lesions anywhere along the visual axis or in pathways which modulate visual activity or subserve visual memory. Hallucinations may be simple or complex, transient or persistent, and occur with or without significant changes in visual acuity. (1) There are currently no medications indicated for treatment of benign “release” hallucinations in the elderly, but new insights into the neurochemistry of vision suggest emerging treatments for this family of disorders. A patient with persistent Charles Bonnet syndrome who responded to the novel antipsychotic pimavanserin is described below. An 81-year-old man noted the sudden onset of hallucinations while walking down a hotel hallway; the hallway suddenly appeared to be filled with construction scaffolding. The hallucinations occurred four years prior to evaluation. Over time, the patient's symptoms gradually increased and grew to include a “spider web” or “shattered windshield” that would appear over his food or on the television, obscuring his vision and making activities of daily living difficult. He also reported cerebral polyopia (up to 5× duplication) and palinopsia. At the patient's assisted living facility, the nurses' colored pants or smocks would smear onto the wall if he looked away; sometimes, the images would persist in his vision for minutes. The patient's ocular history included previous uncomplicated cataract extraction and dry macular degeneration with worsening visual loss accompanied by an alternating exotropia. He denied symptoms of rapid eye movement behavior disorder. Medications of note included 15 mg of mirtazapine nightly for appetite and 50 mg of tramadol once daily for arthritis; the patient's symptoms had also predated the use of these medications, and their addition did not correlate with the progression of symptoms. He was not on a proton pump inhibitor. Best-corrected visual acuities were 20/100 in the right eye and count fingers in the left eye; this represented a slow decline from bilateral visual acuities of 20/25 4 years earlier. Despite the loss of central vision, the patient's peripheral visual fields remained intact. Funduscopic examination was normal with the exception of geographic atrophy with mottling. Cognition was normal; the patient had full insight into the fact that the visual images were not real. Assessment of movement, speech, and facial expression revealed no evidence of Parkinsonism. MRI of the brain revealed marked ischemic changes in the pons, including the tegmentum, as well as mild generalized atrophy (slightly worse in the right frontal operculum) and mild microvascular changes in the subcortical periventricular white matter (worse in the left parieto-occipital region) (Fig. 1).FIG. 1.: Axial T2 FLAIR images through the mid and upper pons (A and B) and cerebral hemispheres (C). FLAIR, fluid-attenuated inversion recovery.Therapy with escitalopram was attempted but not prescribed by the patient's nursing facility due to a theoretical interaction with tramadol. Therefore, the patient was prescribed pimavanserin (Nuplazid) at a dose of 17 mg daily. Within 2 weeks, he reported near-complete resolution of the hallucinations without apparent medication side effects. The patient occasionally noted very brief after-images triggered by only the most brightly colored clothing. He was able to eat without difficulty and enjoy reading and television. There is substantial clinical overlap between Charles Bonnet syndrome, peduncular hallucinosis, and hallucinations due to various cortical pathologies; this has led some authorities to question the value of the nomenclature and call for a more nuanced view of the definitions. (2) It is likely that there is a “hallucination threshold” that can be reached through a combination of insults to the afferent visual pathway and the modulatory and processing systems. In this case, the patient experienced a sudden onset of initial symptoms, suggesting a vascular etiology. He had clear brainstem pathology. However, over several years, his vision had declined because of macular degeneration, and the symptoms worsened correspondingly. The presence of palinopsia and polyopia indicated a degree of cortical, or at least postgeniculate, involvement. Many patients have mild or self-limited symptoms. In persistent cases where pharmacotherapy for hallucinations has been warranted, it has typically consisted of empiric off-label antipsychotic, antidepressant, or anticonvulsant therapy, with a shift to the atypical antipsychotics as these became available. More recently, the dopaminergic model of hallucinations has been replaced by one of a dopamine/serotonin imbalance. Recognition of the role of ascending or cortical serotonergic neurons in modulation of visual activity has led to the approval of pimavanserin solely for the treatment of visual hallucinations in Parkinson disease. (3,4) This medication is undergoing further evaluation in other dementing illnesses associated with hallucinations. Pimavanserin functions as a potent antagonist/inverse agonist at the 5HT2A receptor and demonstrates a slightly lower affinity for the 5HT2C receptor, but has no dopaminergic activity. The relative contribution of the 2 receptors to the therapeutic effect of this medication is uncertain, but both seem involved and both are found at numerous sites involved in visual processing and association and are upregulated in patients with Parkinson disease psychosis. (5) Loss of serotonergic neurons from the dorsal raphe nucleus is believed to disinhibit the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), resulting in peduncular hallucinosis. However, the available evidence suggests a relative paucity of 5HT2A/C receptors in the LGN or its cortical projections; this suggests that the therapeutic effect of pimavanserin and other low-potency neuroleptics involves action elsewhere (6). Similar clinical results have been obtained with escitalopram, the most specific of the serotonin reuptake inhibitors, in patients with both Parkinson disease and Charles Bonnet syndrome (7,8) This apparent contradiction suggests more than one role for serotonin in the genesis of hallucinations. The myriad presynapatic and somatodendritic serotonin autoreceptors (primarily 5HT1A), varying inhibitory and excitatory responses to serotonergic signaling, and widespread cortical projections from the brainstem nuclei make this plausible. Alternatively, downregulation of overall serotonin receptor density, including the 5HT2A/C subgroup, could explain the benefit seen with escitalopram. This case report offers further evidence that benign visual hallucinations in elderly patients may be multifactorial, arising from a combination of reduced visual input and damage to the ascending modulatory pathways or cortical processing centers; our patient's scenario suggests a role for 5HT2A/C blockade in this disorder. Dopamine-neutral therapy with pimavanserin may offer advantages over conventional low-potency antipsychotics or nonspecific serotonergic antidepressants, although cost considerations may limit its usefulness as a first-line agent. Further study of Pimavanserin in this patient population seems warranted. STATEMENT OF AUTHORSHIP Category 1: a. conception and design: R. A. Boren; b. acquisition of data: R. A. Boren and C. B.

      "title": "1226 Shift Workers Acting Out? A Case of Shift Work Sleep Disorder Causing REM Behavior Disorder",
      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction Rapid eye movement behavior disorder (RBD) is the manifestation of dream enactment with the failure of muscle atonia during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Shift work sleep disorder presents as sleep disruption and/or excessive sleepiness due to an atypical work schedule. Here we show a unique case of RBD provoked by a longstanding history of shift work sleep disorder. Report of case(s) 67-year-old male with shift work sleep disorder, hypertension, and depression who presented for evaluation of RBD. Patient recently retired as a night shift worker and was taking melatonin and citalopram for more than 20 years. For the past several months, the patient has been having episodes of acting out his dreams, such as punching his wife if he was dreaming about punching someone in his sleep. Patient’s polysomnography showed REM sleep without atonia (RWA) in the chin and limb leads with 30% of the 30-s epochs having chin EMG activity with bilateral flexor digitorum superficialis (FDA) phasic EMG activity. Patient’s melatonin dose was increased and he was also started on benzodiazepine with control of his symptoms. Conclusion The common risk factors of RBD include Parkinson’s Disease, occupational toxin exposure, antidepressants, psychological stress (PTSD), or compromised health conditions (such as smoking or cardiovascular diseases). The patient has a chronic use of citalopram but antidepressant-induced RBD usually presents in the fourth/fifth decade of life. A review of literature indicates no cases of shift work disorder causing RBD. However, disruptions in the circadian rhythm put shift workers at an increased risk for conditions such as cardiovascular disease, metabolic syndrome, and psychological disorders, all exposures for RBD. Patient developed shift work sleep disorder causing sleep-onset and sleep-maintenance insomnia with a disturbance in the circadian rhythm, ultimately leading to an increased risk for developing RBD. Treatment for RBD includes melatonin as the first-line treatment with addition of low-dose clonazepam or cholinergic agents. With the increasing prevalence of shift work, it is imperative to understand the risks of shift work and identify sleep disorders that may arise, such as RBD, through more research.

As with other forms of disordered eating, cognitive and behavioral treatment modalities may be effective in reducing NES symptoms. This review presents evidence for a variety of behavioral treatment approaches, including behavioral therapy, phototherapy, behavioral weight loss treatment, and cognitive-behavioral therapy. A more detailed overview of cognitive-behavioral therapy for NES is provided. All of these studies have been case studies or included small samples, and all but one have been uncontrolled, but the outcomes of many of these approaches are promising. Larger randomized controlled trials are warranted to advance NES treatment literature. With the inclusion of NES in the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) as a \"Feeding or Eating Disorder Not Elsewhere Classified,\" more sophisticated, empirically-supported, behaviorally-based treatment approaches are much needed.",

Abgesehen von kardialen und rhythmogenen Ursachen entwickeln sich im Gegensatz dazu Bewusstseinsstörungen (bis hin zu komatösen Zuständen) bei internistisch-organischen Erkrankungen über einen längeren Zeitraum hinweg und erfüllen somit per definitionem - abgesehen von seltenen Ausnahmen - nicht die Kriterien von Anfällen oder Synkopen. Dies gilt insbesondere für schwere Leber- und Nierenerkrankungen, schwere endokrine und Stoffwechselstörungen sowie schwere Entgleisungen des Wasser-, Elektrolyt- und Säure-Basen-Haushalts. Gelegentlich können allerdings eine Hypoglykämie, Nebennierenrindeninsuffizienz, Hypo- und Hypernatriämie oder auch Hypokalzämie akute neurologisch-psychiatrische oder synkopale Zustandsbilder hervorrufen, die zunächst häufig verkannt werden. Diese Erkrankungen können durch unauffällige Befunde bei Basisuntersuchungen und \"Routinelabor\" bereits weitgehend ausgeschlossen werden.",

      "title": "Clinical Practice Guideline: Ménière’s Disease",
      "abstract": "Objective Ménière’s disease (MD) is a clinical condition defined by spontaneous vertigo attacks (each lasting 20 minutes to 12 hours) with documented low‐ to midfrequency sensorineural hearing loss in the affected ear before, during, or after one of the episodes of vertigo. It also presents with fluctuating aural symptoms (hearing loss, tinnitus, or ear fullness) in the affected ear. The underlying etiology of MD is not completely clear, yet it has been associated with inner ear fluid (endolymph) volume increases, culminating in episodic ear symptoms (vertigo, fluctuating hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness). Physical examination findings are often unremarkable, and audiometric testing may or may not show low‐ to midfrequency sensorineural hearing loss. Conventional imaging, if performed, is also typically normal. The goals of MD treatment are to prevent or reduce vertigo severity and frequency; relieve or prevent hearing loss, tinnitus, and aural fullness; and improve quality of life. Treatment approaches to MD are many and typically include modifications of lifestyle factors (eg, diet) and medical, surgical, or a combination of therapies. Purpose The primary purpose of this clinical practice guideline is to improve the quality of the diagnostic workup and treatment outcomes of MD. To achieve this purpose, the goals of this guideline are to use the best available published scientific and/or clinical evidence to enhance diagnostic accuracy and appropriate therapeutic interventions (medical and surgical) while reducing unindicated diagnostic testing and/or imaging.",

In assessing for the clinical significance of obsessions, persistence is first assessed, followed by distress and resistance. The interviewer should list and rate each obsession identified by the child using the Feelings Thermometer. Meanwhile, in assessing for compulsions, the frequency of the repetitive behavior is rated. Diagnosis of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder requires the presence of persistent obsessions, which are repetitive and difficult to control, and/or compulsions, or both (more than 1 hour each day). In addition, the symptoms must cause marked distress or cause significant interference in functioning. Recognition by the child that the symptoms are excessive or unreasonable is not necessary to make the diagnosis in children.",

      "abstract": "Over one million mild traumatic brain injuries (TBI) occur annually in the United States. Most of these patients recover full function within about 3 months, but a significant minority do not. Failure to recover as expected following a diagnosed or suspected mild TBI is most commonly related to a concurrent diagnosis or alternative diagnosis or condition. Consideration during the diagnostic process must be given to alternative organic conditions (prior or unsuspected severe TBI, pain, medication side effects or dementia), pre-existing non-organic conditions (active or dormant psychiatric conditions, pre-existing personality characteristics, or social/economic factors), non-clinical conditions (compensation/litigation, malingering) or post-injury psychiatric morbidity (notably depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder, panic disorder, or conversion disorder). Scrupulous care must be given during the history, physical examination, and neuropsychologic assessment of the patient to evaluate for different or contributory diagnostic possibilities; not all patients that have symptoms following a blow to the head have traumatic brain injury as the sole etiologic agent for their symptoms. Accurate diagnosis will lead to better treatment and optimal outcomes. Future research should focus on early identification of the 'slow to recover' group to allow early and appropriate treatment.",

      "abstract": "Conduct disorder is the most prevalent psychopathologic condition of childhood. It is characterized by a persistent and repetitive pattern of aggressive, noncompliant, intrusive, and poorly self-controlled behaviors that violate either the rights of others or age-appropriate societal norms.1 These behaviors have a significant impact on the daily functioning of the child or adolescent and on the ability of parents and other adults to manage them. The specific behavioral criteria for the diagnosis of conduct disorder can be conceptualized as either aggressive or nonaggressive in type (Table 1). Examples of aggressive behaviors are physical fighting and bullying, assault, vandalism, purse snatching, physical cruelty to persons or animals, breaking and entering, and arson. More serious aggressive behaviors are armed robbery, rape, and extortion. Nonaggressive behaviors of conduct disorder include substance abuse, persistent truancy, running away from home overnight, frequent lying in a variety of social settings, theft not involving a confrontation with a victim, and chronic violation of rules or the basic rights of others. Three subtypes of conduct disorder are identified in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, revised 3rd edition.1 These are descriptions of the functional contexts in which the particular behavior problems occur. The group type involves problematic behaviors that occur as part of an activity with peers.",

      "abstract": "Memory problems are a common complaint in most older persons. The brain has two kinds of memory – recent and remote (old). Recent memory includes facts or events that occurred within the last hour so, while remote (old) memory is facts or events from the distant past, e.g., college memories, high school memories, etc. Recent memory is like a computer workstation while remote memory or old memory is like the hard disk. The brain remembers facts or events by loading them into recent memory and then moving them to old memory. Your hard disk becomes saturated somewhere around 40 to 60-years of age and after 60 it becomes slightly more difficult to hold on to facts or events. Scientists recognize four general types of memory states for older people: 1) good as new, 2) good as almost new, 3) mild impairment, and 4) dementia. “Good as new” means that you can remember things as well as when you were 20 or 30 years of age. “Good as almost new” means that it’s harder to remember large bodies of information but you can still commit normal amounts of information to memory. Mild cognitive impairment means that memory is impaired to the point where people have difficulty, but they do not have other evidence of dementia. Dementia means that memory is lost and other intellectual functions are also damaged, e.g., communication, motor skills.",

For two years, he presented with unspecified behavior changes, autonomic and neuroglycopenic symptoms, which led him to be misdiagnosed with a neurologic and psychiatric disorder before the insulinoma was recognized. Following neurological alterations in context of hypoglycemia, subsequent to longstanding food refusal, he was admitted in the psychiatric ward. Despite good global response and normal food intake, hypoglycemic episodes were still occurring and led to a careful evaluation which permitted the definitive diagnostic. This case highlights the diagnostic difficulties of medical disorders presenting with clinical features overlapping neurological and psychiatric syndromes. It also reflects the diagnostic difficulties in rare clinical entities, particularly in patients previously followed in psychiatry and underlines the need for a constant dialogue and updating of clinicians.",

      "title": "Sleep and Circadian Rhythm Disorders",
      "abstract": "Sleep disorders are an important aspect of geriatric psychiatry. In the United States, more than half of noninstitutionalized individuals age 65 years and older report chronic sleep difficulties (Foley et al. 1995; \"National Institutes of Health Consensus Development Conference Statement\" 1991; Prinz et al. 1990). These problems affect quality of life, increase the risk of accidents and falls, and may lead to long-term-care placement (Pollak and Perlick 1991; Pollak et al. 1990; Sanford 1975). Working effectively with elderly individuals requires expertise in the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders. DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association 2013) includes eight general sleep disorders categories: insomnia disorder, hypersomolence disorder, narcolepsy, breathing-related sleep disorders, circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders, parasomnias, restless legs syndrome, and substance/medication-induced sleep disorder. Patients with these conditions generally complain about some aspect of their sleep and/or waking function. For some patients, the sleep-focused concerns pertain to the quality, timing, amounts, or discontinuity in their sleep. For other patients, primary complaints may focus more on daytime sleepiness or impairment. For a subset of patients, complaints may focus on unusual behaviors occurring in sleep. In this chapter we consider those sleep-wake disorders most commonly encountered in geriatric psychiatry. Among these are those insomnia disorders involving a difficulty initiating or maintaining sleep with associated daytime impairment or distress, as well as those that present as disorders of excessive daytime somnolence characterized by persistent daytime sleepiness that causes significant distress or impairment in function (American Psychiatric Association 2000; American Sleep Disorders Association 1997). The most important disorders of excessive sleepiness are sleep ap-nea, restless legs syndrome/periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD), and narcolepsy. Circadian rhythm disorders manifest as a misalignment between an indi-vidual's sleep-wake cycle and the pattern that is desired or required (American Psychiatric Association 2000; American Sleep Disorders Association 1997). The circadian rhythm is important for function because it is a cycle not only of sleep and wakefulness but also of many physiological processes and phe-nomena, including body temperature, alertness, cognitive performance, and hormone release (Czeisler et al. 1990; Folkard and Totterdell 1994; Minors et al. 1994).",

      "abstract": "During 3–5 weeks of gestation, there is formation and closure of neural tube, also termed as dorsal induction. The primary neurulation process is responsible for the development of brain and spinal cord up to S2 from the neural tube. Secondary neurulation occurs later and results in the formation of caudal part of the neural tube that develops into sacral and coccygeal segments. The cranial segment of the neural tube develops into the forebrain, midbrain, and hindbrain. The caudal segment of the neural tube develops into the spinal cord and spine. Partial or complete failure of closure of the neural groove leads to neural tube defects (or defects of dorsal induction) and multiple causes have been identified. These include folic acid deficiency, maternal diabetes, exposure to teratogens, and karyotype/genetic defects [1, 2].",

      "title": "Fidgety movements – tiny in appearance, but huge in impact",
      "abstract": "To describe fidgety movements (FMs), i.e., the spontaneous movement pattern that typically occurs at 3–5 months after term age, and discuss its clinical relevance. A comprehensive literature search was performed using the following databases: MEDLINE/PubMed, CINAHL, The Cochrane Library, Science Direct, PsycINFO, and EMBASE. The search strategy included the MeSH terms and search strings ('fidgety movement*') OR [('general movement*') AND ('three month*') OR ('3 month*')], as well as studies published on the General Movements Trust website (www.general-movements-trust.info). Virtually all infants develop normally if FMs are present and normal, even if their brain ultrasound findings and/or clinical histories indicate a disposition to later neurological deficits. Conversely, almost all infants who never develop FMs have a high risk for neurological deficits such as cerebral palsy, and for genetic disorders with a late onset. If FMs are normal but concurrent postural patterns are not age-adequate or the overall movement character is monotonous, cognitive and/or language skills at school age will be suboptimal. Abnormal FMs are unspecific and have a low predictive power, but occur exceedingly in infants later diagnosed with autism. Abnormal, absent, or sporadic FMs indicate an increased risk for later neurological dysfunction, whereas normal FMs are highly predictive of normal development, especially if they co-occur with other smooth and fluent movements. Early recognition of neurological signs facilitates early intervention. It is important to re-assure parents of infants with clinical risk factors that the neurological outcome will be adequate if FMs develop normally. Descrever os movimentos irregulares (FMs), ou seja, o padrão de movimentos espontâneos que normalmente ocorrem entre 3 e 5 meses após o nascimento e discutir sua relevância clínica. Uma pesquisa abrangente na literatura foi realizada nas seguintes bases de dados: MEDLINE/PubMed, CINAHL, The Cochrane Library, Science Direct, PsycINFO e EMBASE. A estratégia de busca incluiu os termos e cadeias de pesquisa do MeSH [(\"fidgety movement*\") OU [(\"general movement*\") E (\"three month*\") OU (\"3 month*\")], bem como estudos publicados no website da General Movements Trust (www.general-movements-trust.info). Praticamente todos os neonatos se desenvolveram normalmente se os FMs estiveram presentes e foram normais, mesmo se seus resultados do ultrassom do cérebro e/ou históricos clínicos indicassem tendência a déficits neurológicos posteriores. Por outro lado, quase todos os neonatos que nunca desenvolveram FMs apresentaram maior risco de déficits neurológicos, como paralisia cerebral, e doenças genéticas de início tardio. Caso os FMs fossem normais, porém simultâneos a padrões posturais não adequados para a idade, ou o caráter geral dos movimentos fosse monótono, as capacidades cognitivas e/ou de linguagem na idade escolar seriam abaixo do ideal. Os FMs anormais não são específicos e têm baixo poder preditivo, porém ocorrem em grande parte em neonatos posteriormente diagnosticados com autismo. FMs anormais, ausentes ou esporádicos indicam um risco maior de disfunções neurológicas posteriores, ao passo que FMs normais são altamente preditivos de desenvolvimento normal, principalmente se forem simultâneos a outros movimentos suaves e fluentes. O reconhecimento precoce de sinais neurológicos facilita a intervenção antecipada. É importante garantir aos pais de neonatos com fatores de risco clínicos que o resultado neurológico será adequado se os FMs se desenvolverem normalmente.",

      "title": "Does medically induced weight loss improve obstructive sleep apnoea in the obese: review of randomized trials",
      "abstract": "Obstructive sleep apnoea is characterized by repeated periods of breathing cessation during sleep. Obstructive sleep apnoea is both common and underdiagnosed in the obese. A recent study found that as many as 86% of older obese type 2 diabetics had obstructive sleep apnoea. Obesity is independently associated with developing obstructive sleep apnoea, and the reverse may also occur. The prevalence of obstructive sleep apnoea is therefore expected to rise in the wake of the obesity epidemic. The number of partial (hypopnoea) or complete (apnoea) airway obstructions per hour (apnoea-hypopnoea index) is used to classify obstructive sleep apnoea as mild (5-14 events per hour), moderate (15-30) or severe (>30). Severe obstructive sleep apnoea is associated with a two to sixfold increase in all-cause mortality; the impact of mild and moderate obstructive sleep apnoea is less clear. Until recently, the evidence supporting a beneficial effect of weight loss on obstructive sleep apnoea has been limited by a lack of randomized trials. In 2009, at least three randomized controlled trials evaluated whether medically induced weight loss improves obstructive sleep apnoea. The treatment effect ranged from 42% to 62% improvement, although the highest estimate was seen in a very short duration study (9 weeks). Patients who either lost 10-15 kg or more, or had severe obstructive sleep apnoea at baseline, benefited most from treatment.",

      "title": "Altered mental status after liver transplant",
      "abstract": "Watch a video presentation of this article Mental status alteration occurs in up to 70% of liver transplant (LT) recipients in the early postoperative period and leads to longer hospitalizations and higher mortality rates.1 It is more frequent among patients who had alcoholic cirrhosis as the indication for LT,2, 3 metabolic liver diseases, Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores above 15, and were on mechanical ventilation before LT.3 Causes cover a wide spectrum and can be multifactorial, including residual hepatic encephalopathy (HE), metabolic derangements, immunosuppressive agents and other drugs, including sedatives and narcotics, infections, renal failure, hypoxia, hemodynamic instability, and graft dysfunction (Table 1). These conditions can also lead to seizures, which by themselves are also frequently accompanied by altered mental status. This review focuses on etiologies of altered mental status that are specific and applicable to LT recipients. HE is a common manifestation of decompensated cirrhosis that results from inadequate metabolism of ammonia and other toxins by the failing liver and/or from significant shunting of the portal blood away from the liver through collateral vessels. It is an independent predictor of neurological complications after LT, but it typically resolves fairly rapidly within the first few days after LT in the setting of a functioning graft. In a few patients, however, early allograft dysfunction or persistence of large spontaneous portosystemic shunts may promote persistent HE after LT, until graft function improves or the shunts are ligated or embolized. Patients who undergo LT with severe HE, alcohol-related liver disease, or high MELD scores may have slower resolution of HE after LT,4 but failure of a patient to awaken after LT should prompt a thorough investigation. Immunosuppressive agents administered after LT can cause alterations in mental status, and concomitant drugs that inhibit their metabolism may exacerbate this complication. Corticosteroids can cause confusion, mood disturbances, manic states, or psychosis, which improve with dose reduction or drug discontinuation. Calcineurin inhibitors (cyclosporine and tacrolimus) can cause posterior reversible leukoencephalopathy syndrome (PRES), particularly when given intravenously or when serum levels are high, although it can also occur within therapeutic serum levels. There have also been rare reports of PRES attributed to sirolimus and mycophenolate mofetil. PRES is a syndrome characterized by alterations in perfusion of the brain caused by vasoconstriction (Fig. 1), typically occurring in patients with underlying arterial hypertension exacerbated by the immunosuppressive agent. Symptoms include nausea, emesis, headache, cortical blindness, and in severe cases, seizures and altered consciousness. Cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows vasogenic brain edema in occipital and parietal areas. Most patients respond to management of the blood pressure and dose reduction or, preferably, drug discontinuation.2, 4, 5 Tacrolimus and cyclosporine do not have the same exact mechanism for causing PRES, and one drug can be substituted for the other when PRES occurs.1 Outside of PRES, calcineurin inhibitors can also cause other mental symptoms, including psychosis, hallucinations, akinetic mutism, seizures, and encephalopathy. Seizures, if present, should be treated with antiepileptic agents, and drugs available in parenteral form include phenytoin, fosphenytoin, levetiracetam, and lacosamide.4 Phenytoin levels must be closely monitored in LT recipients because of its affinity for albumin, which tends to be low in this population, and its drug interaction with immunosuppressive agents. Central pontine myelinolysis (CPM) or osmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) may occur in up to 1% to 4% of LT recipients,4-6 with susceptible patients typically having prolonged hyponatremia before LT, which is inadvertently corrected too rapidly during the massive fluid shifts that occur within the perioperative period. It is characterized by symmetrical loss of myelin in the base of the pons and other areas of the brain, with relative preservation of axons and neuronal bodies, resulting from rapid osmolar shifts in the brain. The most common clinical manifestation is fluctuating levels of consciousness, but it can progress to pseudobulbar palsy and quadriparesis, sometimes leading to a quadriparetic \"locked-in syndrome\" state. MRIs of the brain typically demonstrate hypointense T1 and hyperintense T2 and diffusion-weighted lesions in the central pons5, 6 (Fig. 2). Serum sodium correction before, during, and in the postoperative period should be done with caution at a goal of <10 mEq/L increments per day.2 Patients with CPM/ODS are managed with supportive care, but it usually leads to lifelong disability or death. Anecdotal improvements with thyroid-releasing hormones, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, corticosteroids, plasmapheresis, and intravenous immunoglobulins have been reported but remain to be proved.6 Infections of the central nervous system (CNS) have become infrequent in LT recipients because of advances in surveillance and prophylactic measures. Acquired infections within the first 30 days are often related to pretransplant colonization, surgical procedures, or rarely, donor-to-recipient disease transmission either by blood products or by allograft. Most common causative organisms are bacteria, fungi, viruses, and less likely, protozoa (Table 2). Patients may present with signs of meningitis or meningoencephalitis, or with more focal deficits suggestive of a fungal or bacterial abscess or focal involvement of specific brain regions by viruses. New-onset severe back pain may herald a spinal abscess.5 A timely diagnosis and early treatment with the appropriate antimicrobial agents is key, and abscesses may require drainage. Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy is characterized by progressive neurological decline caused by demyelination, with plaquelike nonenhancing white matter lesions on neuroimaging studies. This is attributed to reactivation of the JC virus within the CNS that often leads to death because it has no known effective treatment.4 Other rare causes of altered mental status include cerebrovascular events such as ischemic strokes in 0% to 3% and intracranial hemorrhage in 1% to 7% of LT recipients.6 Predisposed individuals for ischemic strokes are diabetics, older recipients, and those with valvular heart disease and/or cardiac arrhythmias.5, 6 A stroke from air embolism related to venovenous bypass during LT surgery may occur but is uncommon. Coagulopathy and thrombocytopenia that commonly accompany advanced cirrhosis predispose LT recipients to intracranial hemorrhage in the immediate post-LT period. Hypoxia, hypotension, extreme glucose levels, and electrolyte derangements (such as hypercalcemia, hypermagnesemia, hyponatremia, hypernatremia, hyposmolarity, and hyperosmolarity) can contribute to altered mentation. Although occurrences are rare, altered mental status may also result from donor transmission of metabolic diseases with neuropsychiatric complications such as urea cycle disorders and acute intermittent porphyria.7 The management of altered mental status is rooted in making the timely diagnosis (Fig. 3) and appropriate treatment of the underlying cause, including optimization of metabolic disturbances. Adequate blood oxygenation and circulation must be maintained, and electrolyte derangements must be corrected. Caution must be exercised in correcting hyponatremia too quickly to avoid the development of CPM/ODS. Neuroimaging studies should be obtained early to allow for appropriate diagnosis of cerebrovascular events, focal brain abnormalities in those suspected to have CNS infections, CPM/ODS, or PRES. Treatment is directed toward the identified cause. Nonetheless, if agitation interferes with the patient's medical care or poses a risk to the patient's safety, symptomatic treatment with antipsychotic agents may be helpful. Haloperidol is a classic drug with the longest clinical experience and is quite effective; it can be given intravenously at 0.5 to 1.0 mg per dose, but limit to a total of 5 mg/day to avoid extrapyramidal side effects. Newer agents such as quetiapine, olanzapine, ziprasidone, and risperidone have been found to be as effective as haloperidol with fewer side effects.2, 6, 8 Benzodiazepines should be avoided because they can perpetuate the delirium, unless alcohol withdrawal is the underlying cause.8 In summary, alterations in mentation after LT can have various causes that may overlap, and a search for the underlying cause is critical in the management. Consultation with a neurologist and a psychiatrist can be valuable when the underlying cause is not easily identified or in the multidisciplinary management of the patient. Symptomatic treatment of delirium while addressing the root cause can improve the medical care and safety of the patient.",

      "title": "Chronic Hiccups: An Underestimated Problem",
      "abstract": "Persistent singultus, hiccupping that lasts for longer than 48 hours, can have a tremendous impact on a patient’s quality of life. Although involved neurologic structures have been identified, the function of hiccups remains unclear—they have been controversially interpreted as a primitive reflex preventing extent swallowing of amniotic fluid in utero, an archaic gill ventilation pattern, or a fetus’ preparation for independent breathing. Persistent singultus often presents as a symptom for various diseases, most commonly illnesses of the central nervous system or gastrointestinal tract; they can also be evoked by a variety of pharmacological agents. It is often impossible to define a singular cause. A wide range of treatment attempts, pharmacological and nonpharmacological, have been concerted to this date; however, chlorpromazine remains the only Food and Drug Administration–approved drug in this context. Large-scale studies on efficacy and tolerance of other therapeutic strategies are lacking. Gabapentin, baclofen, and metoclopramide have been reported to accomplish promising results in reports on the therapy of persistent singultus; they may also be effective when given in combination with other drugs, eg, proton pump inhibitors, or as conjoined therapy. As another approach of note, acupuncture treatment was able to abolish hiccups in a number of studies. When managing hiccup patients within the clinical routine, it is of importance to conduct a comprehensive and effective diagnostic workup; a well-functioning interdisciplinary team is needed to address possible causes for the symptom. Persistent singultus is a medical problem not to be underestimated; more research on options for effective treatment would be greatly needed.",

Most often the guilty were remanded into the hands of family or those of a keeper, a type of temporary guardian, or they were sent to gaol (medieval incarceration in jail or prison) while they awaited their pardons. Some were kept in gaol until mentally stable enough to return to society. Those cases not dismissed because of an obvious mental health condition (as those of persons with childlike behaviour from birth might be) followed a pattern of having the defendant found guilty of the crime, and, because of a lack of intent, they were pardoned and not physically punished other than possibly spending time in incarceration.",

The causes of altered mental status (AMS) or delirium in the elderly are varied, and it is difficult, and at times impossible, to obtain a concise or coherent history without the presence of a family member or caregiver. Some toxic and metabolic causes of delirium are very gradual, such as in chronic aspirin overdose. Infection is a very common cause of delirium in patients presenting to the emergency department (ED). Elderly patients may present with the same signs and symptoms of infection as the general population, such as fever, tachycardia, rigors, and leukocytosis. The Confusion Assessment Method (CAM) is a tool for diagnosing delirium. Adjunctive nonpharmacologic treatments may also be initiated, including frequent reorientation, enabling family to remain with the patient, and normalizing the sleep-wake cycle.",

There is a two-way connection between the psyche and the somatics: mental disorders affect somatic functions, and somatic diseases, in turn, affect the state of the psyche.&#x0D; In this article, the author pays attention to the most common gastroenterological diseases associated with mental disorders. They include: peptic ulcer, functional (gastroduodenal) dyspepsia syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome, functional forms of chronic duodenal obstruction syndrome, chronic cholecystitis and associated extrahepatic biliary dyskinesia.&#x0D; As for the digestive system, psychosomatic disorders are manifested by nausea and vomiting, belching, flatulence, abdominal pain, rumbling and splashing in the intestines, constipation or diarrhea, dry mouth. Anxiety-depressive syndrome in patients is characterized by dyssomnia, chronic anxiety, bodily discomfort, hypothymia, synestopathy, somatoform disorders, frustration, alexithymia, etc.&#x0D; The main criteria and diagnostic tools for depression are described (international classifications, self-assessment scales, diagnostic tests).&#x0D; In addition to the basic individualized therapy for somatic diseases, patients usually need additional prescription of psychotropic drugs and psychological support. The main technique of treatment is psychotherapy (less often — hypnotherapy). Only upon the ineffectiveness of psychotherapy, doctors should resort to the appointment of psychotropic drugs of four different groups: anxiolytics, antidepressants, “small” antipsychotics, nootropics.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Persons are considered excessively sleepy if they are unable to consistently achieve and sustain wakefulness and alertness to accomplish the tasks of daily living. Sleep occurs unintentionally or at inappropriate times or places. In children, sleepiness may manifest as hyperactivity. Excessive sleepiness can be defined using either clinical or Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT) criteria, namely hypersomnolence occurring almost daily for at least 3 months, and mean sleep latency of less than 8 minutes, respectively. Although the likelihood of falling asleep is greater during inactive monotonous situations, severe sleepiness can manifest precipitously as sleep attacks, recurrent episodes of microsleep, or automatic behavior during which there is no memory of semiconscious activities. It is important to distinguish excessive sleepiness from fatigue, exhaustion, tiredness, weariness, listlessness or weakness, which may closely mimic it. Excessive sleepiness is estimated to affect 5% of the general population. Occasional excessive daytime sleepiness may be present in up to a third of the general adult population. Prevalence is greater among adolescents and older adults. Both genders appear to be affected equally. Among young adults, hours of weekday sleep predict daytime sleepiness, as do snoring, depression, marital status (those who are single are more likely to develop daytime sleepiness than married individuals), and employment status (sleepiness is more prevalent among persons employed full-time compared with those who are employed part-time or unemployed).",

      "abstract": "* Abbreviations:\n ASD — : autism spectrum disorder\n GI — : gastrointestinal\n 5-HT — : serotonin\n\nAutism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are a set of complex neurodevelopmental disorders defined behaviorally by impaired social interaction, delayed and disordered language, repetitive or stereotypic behavior, and a restricted range of interests. ASDs represent a significant public health issue with recent estimates indicating that as many as 1% of children in the United States are diagnosed with an ASD.1,2 Many individuals with ASDs have symptoms of associated medical conditions, including seizures, sleep problems, metabolic conditions, and gastrointestinal (GI) disorders, which have significant health, developmental, social, and educational impacts. Gastrointestinal complaints are a commonly reported concern for parents and may be related to problem behaviors and other medical issues such as dysregulated sleep (ATN Annual Registry Report, unpublished data, November 2009).3 Despite the magnitude of these issues, potential GI problems are not routinely considered in ASD evaluations. This likely reflects several factors, including variability in reported rates of GI disorders, controversies regarding the relationship between GI symptoms and the putative causes of autism, the limited verbal capacity of many ASD patients, and the lack of recognition by clinicians that certain behavioral manifestations in children with ASDs are indicators of GI problems (eg, pain, discomfort, or nausea).4–10\n\nWhether GI issues in this population are directly related to the pathophysiology of autism, or are strictly a comorbid condition of ASD remains to be determined, but clinical practice and research to date indicate the important role of GI conditions in ASDs and their impact on children as well as their parents and clinicians.9\n\nOn November 15, 2009, a symposium addressing these issues was organized as an adjunct to the annual meeting of the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition.

      "title": "Neuroticism is a fundamental domain of personality with enormous public health implications",
      "abstract": "Neuroticism is the trait disposition to experience negative affects, including anger, anxiety, self-consciousness, irritability, emotional instability, and depression1. Persons with elevated levels of neuroticism respond poorly to environmental stress, interpret ordinary situations as threatening, and can experience minor frustrations as hopelessly overwhelming. Neuroticism is one of the more well established and empirically validated personality trait domains, with a substantial body of research to support its heritability, childhood antecedents, temporal stability across the life span, and universal presence1, 2. Neuroticism has enormous public health implications3. It provides a dispositional vulnerability for a wide array of different forms of psychopathology, including anxiety, mood, substance, somatic symptom, and eating disorders1, 4. Many instances of maladaptive substance use are efforts to quell or quash the dismay, anxiousness, dysphoria, and emotional instability of neuroticism. Clinically significant episodes of anxiety and depressed mood states will often represent an interaction of the trait or temperament of neuroticism with a life stressor1. Neuroticism is comparably associated with a wide array of physical maladies, such as cardiac problems, disrupted immune functioning, asthma, atopic eczema, irritable bowel syndrome, and even increased risk for mortality2. The relationship of neuroticism to physical problems is both direct and indirect, in that neuroticism provides a vulnerability for the development of these conditions, as well as a disposition to exaggerate their importance and a failure to respond effectively to their treatment. Neuroticism is also associated with a diminished quality of life, including feelings of ill-will, excessive worry, occupational failure, and marital dissatisfaction5. High levels of neuroticism will contribute to poor work performance due to emotional preoccupation, exhaustion, and distraction. Similar to the duel-edged effect of neuroticism on physical conditions, high levels of neuroticism will result in actual impairment to marital relationships but also subjective feelings of marital dissatisfaction even when there is no objective basis for such feelings, which can though in turn lead to actual spousal frustration and withdrawal. Given the contribution of neuroticism to so many negative life outcomes, it has been recommended that the general population be screened for clinically significant levels of neuroticism during routine medical visits1, 6. Screening in the absence of available treatment would be problematic. However, neuroticism is responsive to pharmacologic intervention1. Pharmacotherapy can and does effectively lower levels of the personality trait of neuroticism. Barlow et al7 have also developed an empirically-validated cognitive-behavioral treatment of neuroticism, called the Unified Protocol (UP). They have suggested that current psychological treatments have become overly specialized, focusing on disorder-specific symptoms. The UP was designed to be transdiagnostic. Recognizing the impact of neuroticism across a diverse array of physical and mental health care concerns, the authors of the UP again note that \"the public-health implications of directly treating and even preventing the development of neuroticism would be substantial\"7. Neuroticism has long been recognized since the beginning of basic science personality research and may even be the first domain of personality that was identified within psychology1. Given its central importance for so many different forms of mental and physical dysfunction, it is not surprising that neuroticism is evident within the predominant models of personality, personality disorder, and psychopathology. Neuroticism is one of the fundamental domains of general personality included within the five-factor model or Big Five2. It is also within the dimensional trait model included in Section III of the DSM-5 for emerging measures and models8. This trait model consists of five broad domains, including negative affectivity (along with detachment, psychoticism, antagonism, and disinhibition). As expressed in the DSM-5, \"these five broad domains are maladaptive variants of the five domains of the extensively validated and replicated personality model known as the 'Big Five' or Five Factor Model of personality\"8. Neuroticism is likewise aligned with the negative affective domain included within the dimensional trait model of personality disorder proposed for the ICD-119. Finally, it is also evident within the transdiagnostic Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) of the National Institute of Mental Health, as RDoC negative valence encapsulates such constructs as fear, distress, frustration, and perceived loss10. It would be inaccurate to suggest that RDoC negative valence is equivalent to neuroticism, but it is self-evident that they are closely aligned. Currently, there is considerable interest in the general factors of psychopathology, personality disorder, and personality. To the extent that degree of impairment and dysfunction (which largely defines the general factors) is associated with level of distress and dismay, which is quite likely to be the case, we would propose that neuroticism will explain a substantial proportion of the variance in those general factors. In sum, neuroticism is a fundamental domain of personality that has enormous public health implications, impacting a wide array of psychopathological and physical health care concerns. It contributes to the occurrence of many significantly harmful life outcomes, as well as impairing the ability of persons to adequately address them. It has long been recognized as one of the more important and significant domains of personality and is being increasingly recognized as a fundamental domain of personality disorder and psychopathology more generally.

      "abstract": "The effects of environmental chemicals, drugs, and physical agents on the developing kidney are influenced by the state of renal development and maturation. The development of the kidney, the major excretory organ after birth, consists of 3 stages: the pronephros, or cervical kidney; mesonephros, or thoracic kidney; and metanephros, or abdominal kidney, the definitive kidney. In humans, nephrogenesis and organogenesis occur from the 6th to the 36th weeks of gestational age. After 36 weeks, nephrogenesis is complete and each kidney has a full complement of nephrons. The extent of chemical-induced renal toxicity is related, in part, to the efficiency in which the particular compound is transported by renal tubules. Because renal tubular transport capacities vary with maturation, the degree of nephrotoxicity may also vary with maturation. The signs and symptoms of nephrotoxicity can appear acutely or insidiously. Unexplained acute renal failure, chronic mild proteinuria, or even hypertension can be a manifestation of nephrotoxic agents. Species differences occur, thus the need for studies in humans.",

Burning mouth syndrome (BMS) is a condition with an intraoral burning dysaesthetic sensation or pain that recurs daily for more than 2 hours for more than 3 months. The most common site of burning sensation is the tongue, but other sites of the oral cavity are also affected. BMS is a primary condition diagnosed after ruling out causative lesions through clinical examination and supplementary investigations. Burning mouth symptoms can be secondary to local or systemic causes such as candida infections, oral lichen planus, hyposalivation, allergies, anemia, or vitamin deficiencies. The typical patient with BMS is a middle-aged or postmenopausal woman. Evidence suggests that these patients experience higher levels of psychological distress, such as anxiety and depression, when compared to the general population. Although several treatment approaches are suggested, there is still no consensus, but all patients suffering from BMS should always receive counselling including information on home remedies and lifestyle factors such as avoiding dehydration, acidic foods and drinks, spicy food, alcohol and tobacco products, alcohol-based mouth rinses, flavoured oral hygiene products, and, if possible, stress. Antidepressants, anxiolytics, and psychotherapies are front-line treatments for BMS. Taken together, BMS is a bothersome condition for which we still have knowledge gaps regarding etiology, pathophysiology, and treatment approaches and need to be further investigated.",

      "title": "SÍNDROME DE EKBOM EN PACIENTE GERIÁTRICO. A PROPÓSITO DE UN CASO.",
      "abstract": "Se presenta el caso de un varón de 92 años con antecedentes de degeneración macular bilateral, hipoacusia moderada, trastorno del sueño y enfermedad cardiovascular (HTA, BAV de primer y segundo grado), sin deterioro cognitivo significativo (MEC 28/35). Desde hace aproximadamente un año, el paciente refiere percepciones visuales de pequeños animales (“bichos”) que asocia con palomas o gallinas, así como sensaciones táctiles compatibles con formicación. Estas percepciones son interpretadas como infestación corporal, llegando a relacionarlas con la ingesta alimentaria o vía nasal. No se evidencian lesiones dérmicas ni signos objetivos de infestación. El uso de insecticida ha sido reforzador de la convicción delirante. La sintomatología se presenta en el contexto de pérdida visual severa, sin evidencia de psicosis activa ni trastorno del ánimo mayor, aunque se detecta componente afectivo reactivo vinculado al duelo prolongado por fallecimiento de su esposa. Se han considerado dos entidades clínicas como principales diagnósticos diferenciales: el síndrome de Charles Bonnet (alucinaciones visuales complejas secundarias a déficit visual, sin ideación delirante estructurada)1 y el síndrome de Ekbom o delirio de parasitosis (trastorno delirante somático caracterizado por creencia firme de infestación, frecuentemente acompañado de alucinaciones táctiles)2. Dado el contenido delirante persistente, la falta de crítica y la asociación con conductas compensatorias (uso de insecticida), el cuadro clínico se orienta hacia un síndrome de Ekbom con posible base sensorial y afectiva. Se recomienda intervención interdisciplinar con Psiquiatría para valorar inicio de tratamiento antipsicótico a dosis ajustadas a edad y comorbilidad, revisión de tratamiento psicotrópico (trazodona, zolpidem) y activación de redes de apoyo social. Este caso ilustra la complejidad diagnóstica de los trastornos perceptivos en el adulto mayor, así como la interacción entre déficits sensoriales, factores afectivos y creencias delirantes en el contexto geriátrico5.",

      "abstract": "High altitude deterioration means a gradual diminution in man’s capacity to do work at great heights. This is associated with insomnia, lack of appetite, loss of weight and increasing lethargy. These symptoms appear after a prolonged stay above 18000 ft. and there is great individual variation. Man would deteriorate after a time at these heights even under the best con­ditions: if he is doing hard work and is subjected to many strains, mental and physical, other factors are brought to bear which will aggravate this basic state. Such factors are illness, exhaustion, starvation and dehydration. Symptoms similar to those of deterioration, but more acute in onset, appear if man goes too quickly to high altitudes without first acclimatizing. These symptoms of acute mountain sickness disappear if the subject returns to lower levels for some time. If he goes to moderate heights when acclimatizing he will be able to stay for reasonably long periods without undue trouble. Exhaustion at high altitudes is often only cured by coming down to lower levels, as above a certain height there seems to be little or no recovery.",

      "title": "Nocturia: Evaluation and Management.",
      "abstract": "Nocturia (ie, awakening to void one or more times per night) is common in adults, with increasing prevalence in older age. Nocturia is associated with increased risk of falls and fractures, cognitive impairment, and depressed mood. In general, mechanisms for nocturia fall into one of four categories: increased nighttime urine production, decreased storage ability, incomplete bladder emptying, or primary sleep disorder. Although screening for nocturia currently is not recommended, patients reporting bothersome symptoms should be evaluated and treated. Initial workup includes assessing urinary symptoms, fluid intake, and comorbidities. Using validated nocturia questionnaires and frequency-volume charts (bladder diaries) can aid in diagnosis. A urinalysis should be performed for all patients. Lifestyle modifications and treatment of underlying comorbidities are first-line therapies for nocturia. Limitation of fluid intake, especially in the evening; addressing timing of diuretic intake; and sleep hygiene are recommended. Pharmacotherapy should be reserved for those unresponsive to lifestyle modifications and adequate treatment of comorbidities. Pharmacotherapy should target the etiology of nocturia, such as nocturnal polyuria, overactive bladder, benign prostatic hyperplasia, and genitourinary syndrome of menopause. Patients with refractory symptoms should be referred for further treatment (eg, onabotulinumtoxinA injection, sacral neuromodulation, surgical management of benign prostatic hyperplasia).",

      "title": "Ischemic optic neuropathy as first presentation in patient with m.3243 A &gt; G MELAS classic mutation",
      "abstract": "Mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (MELAS) syndrome is a systemic disorder in which multi-organ dysfunction may occur from mitochondrial metabolism failure. Maternally inherited mutations in the MT-TL1 gene are the most frequent causes for this disorder. Clinical manifestations may include stroke-like episodes, epilepsy, dementia, headache and myopathy. Among these, acute visual failure, usually in association with cortical blindness, can occur because of stroke-like episodes affecting the occipital cortex or the visual pathways. Vision loss due to optic neuropathy is otherwise considered a typical manifestation of other mitochondrial diseases such as Leber hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON).Here we describe a 55-year-old woman, sister of a previously described patient with MELAS harbouring the m.3243A > G (p.0, MT-TL1) mutation, with otherwise unremarkable medical history, that presented with subacute, painful visual impairment of one eye, accompanied by proximal muscular pain and headache. Over the next weeks, she developed severe and progressive vision loss limited to one eye. Ocular examination confirmed unilateral swelling of the optic nerve head; fluorescein angiography showed segmental perfusion delay in the optic disc and papillary leakage. Neuroimaging, blood and CSF examination and temporal artery biopsy ruled out neuroinflammatory disorders and giant cell arteritis (GCA). Mitochondrial sequencing analysis confirmed the m.3243A > G transition, and excluded the three most common LHON mutations, as well as the m.3376G > A LHON/MELAS overlap syndrome mutation. Based on the constellation of clinical symptoms and signs presented in our patient, including the muscular involvement, and the results of the investigations, the diagnosis of optic neuropathy as a stroke-like event affecting the optic disc was performed. L-arginine and ubidecarenone therapies were started with the aim to improve stroke-like episode symptoms and prevention. The visual defect remained stable with no further progression or outbreak of new symptoms.Atypical clinical presentations must be always considered in mitochondrial disorders, even in well-described phenotypes and when mutational load in peripheral tissue is low. Mitotic segregation of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) does not allow to know the exact degree of heteroplasmy existent within different tissue, such as retina and optic nerve. Important therapeutic implications arise from a correct diagnosis of atypical presentation of mitochondrial disorders.",

After an intercurrent illness with profound malnutrition, she developed a paranoid delirium and some behavioural disorders; concomitant diarrhoea and a skin rash were noted. Parenteral nicotinamide (500 mg/day) resulted in a complete recovery from the mental disorders after five days. Other causes of mental disturbance as a result of dialysis could be ruled out. However an asymptomatic underlying hypothyroidism may have been one of the conditioning factors as well as the failure to administer nicotinamide supplements during an acute illness. Neurological pellagra could thus be considered as a rare but reversible cause of mental disorders in patients on maintenance haemodialysis.",

      "abstract": "El Sindrome de Intestino Irritable (SII) es considerado como un desorden\r\nfuncional de tipo motor, que se caracteriza por una serie de sintomas que\r\nincluyen dolor abdominal y alteraciones en el habito intestinal, el cual se\r\nmanifiesta como constipacion, diarrea o la alternancia de estas. La enfermedad\r\ncon frecuencia se presenta inicialmente en adultos jovenes, alrededor de los 20\r\nanos de edad, siendo mas frecuente en mujeres que en hombres (1.5-3:1).\r\nRepresenta uno de los diagnosticos mas comunes en la practica clinica diaria\r\nen un 12%. Este sindrome puede ocurrir a cualquier edad, pero a menudo\r\ncomienza en la adolescencia o principios de la vida adulta. El tratamiento del\r\nSII como padecimiento multifactorial, es complejo y de dificil manejo que en la\r\nmayoria de ocasiones no tiene resultados satisfactorios. La acupuntura en\r\ncambio tiene un efecto analgesico bien reconocido e incide en varias\r\nestructuras y funciones del sistema nervioso central, promoviendo la secrecion\r\nde multiples neurotransmisores y la respuesta autonomica a traves del\r\nsimpatico y para simpatico, controlando asi las funciones viscerales como la\r\nmotilidad y la secrecion gastrointestinal. Metodo: El estudio se realizo en el\r\nconsultorio del CECYT 12 del Instituto Politecnico Nacional, se elaboro una\r\nhistoria clinica a los profesores que cumplieron con los criterios de inclusion, se\r\nles elaboro y firmaron la carta de consentimiento informado. Se formaron dos\r\ngrupos en forma aleatoria, de 25 pacientes cada uno, a todos los sujetos se les\r\nvaloro el dolor con escala de EVA al inicio y al final de la sesion, y se les cito\r\ndos veces por semana. Resultados: en el periodo de abril a octubre de 2011 se\r\ncaptaron un total de 50 profesores, en el CECyT 12 del IPN, de los cuales el\r\n88% son de sexo femenino y solo el 12% sexo masculino, no hubo pacientes\r\neliminados. Se obtuvo una P<0.05 en la valoracion del dolor con escala de\r\nEVA, ya que el dolor bajo en 2-3 puntos a partir de la 5a sesion en adelante\r\nhasta llegar a 0 en la 10a semana de tratamiento, mostrando diferencias\r\nestadisticamente significativas. Conclusiones: La aguja larga es mas eficaz que\r\nla acupuntura ficticia en la disminucion del dolor en el sindrome de intestino\r\nirritable al ser aplicada en profesores del IPN sin la modificacion de habitos\r\nalimenticios y ocupacionales en grupos de pacientes que no ingerian algun otro\r\ntratamiento para tal patologia.",

Die Binge-Eating-Störung wurde als Diagnose neu in das Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5 (DSM-5) und die International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems 11 (ICD-11) aufgenommen. Ziel der Arbeit Wir geben einen State-of-the-Art-Überblick zu diagnostischen Kriterien, Psychopathologie, Differenzialdiagnostik, Epidemiologie, Komorbiditäten, Entstehungs- und Aufrechterhaltungsfaktoren, Therapie und Versorgungssituation der Binge-Eating-Störung. Material und Methoden Es wurde ein narratives Review erarbeitet. Ergebnisse Die Binge-Eating-Störung ist durch wiederkehrende Essanfälle mit Kontrollverlust gekennzeichnet. Sie ist die häufigste Essstörung in der Allgemeinbevölkerung und häufig mit Übergewicht oder Adipositas vergesellschaftet. Neurobiologische Modelle sehen Veränderungen im Bereich der Emotionsregulation, Belohnungsverarbeitung und Impulskontrolle als ätiologische Beiträge zur Binge-Eating-Störung. Psychotherapie ist der Behandlungsansatz der ersten Wahl bei der Binge-Eating-Störung, die häufig unentdeckt und unversorgt bleibt. Ein Grund hierfür sind erlebte oder befürchtete Stigmatisierung, Scham und Schuldgefühle der Betroffenen. Diskussion Da die Diagnose einer Binge-Eating-Störung die Therapiewahl und Prognose sowohl der Essstörung als auch einer potenziell komorbiden Adipositas beeinflusst, ist das aktive Abklären des Essverhaltens und einer möglichen Essstörung im Rahmen einer motivierenden Gesprächsführung essenziell.",

      "abstract": "Normally, full term babies show evidence of visual fixation at birth or shortly afterwards.1 Visual following responses have even been observed in prematurely born babies.2 The absence of visual responsiveness in a baby of more than 8 weeks old has to be taken seriously and warrants careful investigation. Parents are anxious to understand the reason why the baby seems not to see, and want to know the visual prognosis. Visual inattentiveness in a baby can be due to very heterogeneous causes. Obvious causes of visual impairment are bilateral cataracts, persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous, retrolental fibroplasia, chorioretinal colobomata, etc. However, in many babies no underlying cause can be found on routine ophthalmological examination. There are also many pitfalls. For example, the infantile optic disc can be paler than that of an older child and the macula and fundus may be more mottled, which could lead to erroneous diagnoses of optic atrophy and retinal pathology. An incorrect diagnosis of visual impairment in an infant can be devastating to the family. Clinical signs can be typical, but additional technical examinations are necessary in most patients.\n\nThe normal function of the visual system in large part parallels the anatomical development. Prenatal development of the eye and brain occurs relatively early in comparison with other systems. By 6 weeks of gestation, the ocular structures and differentiation of the brain are fairly well developed. The visual system is relatively mature at birth. After birth differential growth of the eye occurs. The anterior structures are, in general, more completely developed than the posterior segment of the eye. In addition to the postnatal growth of the eye, the central visual system is also maturing. The timing of premature birth is significant for the immature visual system.3 Excluding those infants who have suffered complications of preterm …",

Quienes han pasado por circunstancias vitales adversas (desempleo, luto, traumatismos psicologicos) tienen mas probabilidades de sufrir depresion. A su vez puede generar mas estres y disfuncion, empeorar la situacion vital de la persona afectada. (OMS, 2017). La depresion puede llegar a hacerse cronica o recurrente y dificultar sensiblemente el desempeno en el trabajo o la escuela y la capacidad para afrontar la vida diaria. La posibilidad diagnostica de un trastorno depresivo a partir de datos observacionales poco especificos: deterioro en la apariencia y aspecto personal, lentitud en los movimientos, marcha cansina, tono de voz bajo, facies tristes o poco expresivas, llanto facil o espontaneo en la consulta, escasa concentracion durante la entrevista, verbalizacion de idealizacion pesimista, quejas hipocondriacas, alteraciones en el ritmo del sueno, quejas somaticas difusas y dificiles de encuadrar.

      "title": "Chronic dizziness and instability as adverse effects explained by drug-induced vestibulotoxicity.",
      "abstract": "Background Dizziness and imbalance are common symptoms which can cause an important impairment of the ability of the patients affected to perform their daily activities. Diseases affecting posterior labyrinth can explain these symptoms. Ototoxicity is a quite common etiology of simultaneous damage of both labyrinths. The aim of this study is to present and analyze a series of patients with chronic dizziness and imbalance induced by vestibulotoxic pharmaceuticals administration. Methods A prospective study in patients diagnosed by chronic imbalance due to drug-induced vestibulotoxicity was performed, along 12 years. The inclusion criteria were: a) vertigo or balance disorders absent before drug administration; b) appearance of dizziness or imbalance during or just after drug administration; c) persistent symptoms for at least three months; d) dysequilibrium confirmed by abnormal dynamic posturography, and/or e) labyrinthine lesion demonstrated by spontaneous or postheadshake nystagmus, saccades as response to Halmagyi test or hypofunction observed by nystagmographic recording of caloric tests. Results Eight patients were included. In all cases, toxic effect was observed only on posterior labyrinth while cochlear symptoms were absent. All patients complained of feeling of dizziness and unsteadiness. Drugs involved were antibiotics in 4 patients, anti-tuberculosis medicinal products in 2 patients, chemotherapeutic agents in 1 and tamoxifen in the last one. All patients had abnormal dynamic posturography, while caloric tests were normal in 2 and abnormal in 6 patients. A remarkable improvement of clinical status was achieved in 7 patients, while one subject, despite improving her symptoms, continued to have a serious imbalance at the end of follow-up period. Conclusions Dizziness and imbalance as vestibulotoxic effects induced by some drugs are symptoms, likely underdiagnosed, that limit the physical activity and cause a decrease in quality of life of the affected patients. Early detection of these symptoms might allow, in some cases, to replace the vestibulotoxic medication by less toxic or non-ototoxic drug. In those cases with serious diseases, it is not possible to avoid the use of certain drugs but physician might prescribe other compounds to prevent or reduce their ototoxic effect. Keywords: chronic dizziness; chronic instability; ototoxicity; vestibulotoxicity; dynamic posturography.

      "title": "Neglect",
      "abstract": "Neglect of a person at any age is a global complex social problem which can lead to grave medical consequences. It has been present throughout human evolution and manifests variably in different culture and countries. Neglect is not a simple outcome of the breach of caregiver or care provider and care receiver equation. There is overlap in definitions of neglect, abuse and maltreatment. The terms are often used interchangeably. The practitioner should be aware of local definitions and the context in which they are used. The clinical or pathologic assessment of neglect in any setting may be considered incomplete unless it also makes some reference and identifies the causes perceived to contribute to it. Neglect is frequently associated with vulnerabilities such as poor physical and mental health or intellectual (learning) disability. It may also be associated with social status and related to criminal activity, such as trafficking and modern-day slavery. Where pre-existing disease or illness are present, neglect may contribute to a fatal outcome by exacerbating those conditions. The victims of neglect commonly encountered in healthcare settings generally represent extremes of age. They may present with acute traumatic condition or exacerbation of a long-standing illness or complications of trauma. A thorough clinical or pathologic assessment of such patients must be supplemented by a careful analysis of circumstances. As \"neglect\" can apply to all sectors of modern society, solutions for it require the concern and cooperation of communities and professions such as policy making, education, health, law, economics and social work, all of which have the primary responsibility for reporting, assessing and making decisions to maintain appropriate standards of life.",

As well as psychological risk factors, women with pre-existing SMIs are susceptible to obstetric complications, including preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, and emergency cesarean sections, and they are also more at risk of adverse infant outcomes, such as preterm birth and low birth weight. Women with pre-existing SMIs may also adopt certain lifestyle factors that amplify these risks, such as smoking.

      "abstract": "This perspective presents a new comprehensive proposal for sleep bruxism management. Sleep bruxism latest definition, epidemiology and etiologyIn accordance with the latest consensus, sleep bruxism (SB) is defined as a masticatory muscle activity during sleep, characterized as rhythmic (phasic) or non-rhythmic (tonic), and is not considered a movement disorder or a sleep disorder in otherwise healthy individuals. 1It is estimated to occur in up to 15% of the human adult population. 2 Despite many years of research, SB still constitutes a significant diagnostic and therapeutic challenge.There are various risk factors that can contribute to SB: exogenous risk factors, such as smoking, heavy alcohol intake, caffeine, medications, or illicit drugs; psychosocial factors, including perceived stress and anxiety; sleep disorders, involving sleep arousal; and comorbidities, such as obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD). 3Recent research also indicates that SB may be related to the neurotransmission of the serotonin and/or dopamine pathway. 4,5Severe SB seem to co-occur with lower serotonin blood levels, but is not correlated with the blood levels of the enzymes involved in the serotonin synthesis pathway. 5There are also studies supporting the genetic background of SB.The latest studies suggest that the polymorphisms occurring within the genes encoding dopamine and serotonin receptors may be linked with predisposition to SB and SB pathogenesis, and may contribute to the association between SB and OSA in adults. 6Similar associations with regard to the genes encoding dopamine receptors have been observed in children. 7In children, the additional factors increasing SB are the consumption of sugar, screen-time and sleeping habits. 8,9",

In 11% of the patients the \"on-off\" effect was studied (brisk alteranting Parkinsonic and improved states). Clinical observation during 14 hours a day was repeated with different dosages and different regimes of the drug; these modified the daily variations but did not eliminate the syndrome. The electromyographic studies also revealed the \"on and off\" phenomenon in different patients. When the \"long-term syndrome\" is severe, at times it is necessary to stop the drug; the secondary effects are thus decreased and, when the medication is given again, the therapeutic effectiveness is temporarily restored. When the drug is stopped the patients should be watched, since a \"withdrawal syndrome\" may appear.",

      "abstract": "Dyspepsia is a remarkably common symptom in the general population. Although multiple definitions have been used to describe the symptom, the most common explanation is that of chronic or recurrent pain or discomfort (a subjective negative feeling that may be associated with early satiety, fullness, bloating, or nausea) centered in the upper abdomen. When a thorough evaluation of a dyspeptic patient fails to identify a cause for her symptoms, the label of nonulcer or functional dyspepsia is applied. Functional dyspepsia is a heterogeneous disorder characterized by relapsing and remitting symptoms. Treatment strategies should focus on alleviating the most bothersome symptom and can be based on the proposed underlying pathophysiology. The effect of gender on mechanisms of disease, symptom presentation, and treatment response is an area of increasing interest and study. As with other functional gastrointestinal disorders, there appear to be some gender-specific features of functional dyspepsia. Specifically, gender-related differences have been observed in some studies of both the prevalence of individual dyspepsia symptoms, and in gastric emptying and proximal gastric motor function. There also appear to be gender differences in the psychosocial realm, with dyspeptic women experiencing a lesser sense of well-being than dyspeptic men, as well as an association of an abuse history with functional dyspepsia. This review will highlight specific gender differences related to the symptom presentation, pathophysiology, and approach to treatment of functional dyspepsia, while noting where differences have not been found and where further investigation is warranted.",

      "abstract": "Spinal cord injury (SCI) leads generally to an irreversible loss of sensory functions and voluntary motor control below injury level.Cures that could repair SCI and/or restore voluntary walking have not been yet developed nor commercialized.Beyond the well-known loss of walking capabilities, most SCI patients experience also a plethora of motor problems and health concerns including specific bladder and bowel dysfunctions.Indeed, chronic constipation and urinary retention, two significant life-threatening complications, are typically found in patients suffering of traumatic (e.g. , falls or car accidents) or non-traumatic SCI (e.g. , multiple sclerosis, spinal tumors).Secondary health concerns associated with these dysfunctions include hemorrhoids, abdominal distention, altered visceral sensitivity, hydronephrosis, kidney failure, urinary tract infections, sepsis and, in some cases, cardiac arrest.Consequently, individuals with chronic SCI are forced to regularly seek emergency and critical care treatments when some of these conditions occur or become intolerable.Increasing evidence supports the existence of a novel experimental approach that may be capable of preventing the occurrence or severity of bladder and bowel problems.Indeed, recent findings in animal models of SCI have revealed that, despite paraplegia or tetraplegia, it remains possible to elicit episodes of micturition and defecation by acting pharmacologically or electrically upon specialized lumbosacral neuronal networks, namely the spinal or sacral micturition center (SMC) and lumbosacral defecation center (LDC).Daily activation of SMC and LDC neurons could potentially become, new classes of minimally invasive treatments (i.e. , if orally active) against these dysfunctions and their many lifethreatening complications.",

      "title": "Menstrual Psychosis with Premenstrual Onset: A case presentation",
      "abstract": "Introduction Menstrual psychosis has an acute onset and is characterised by confusion, stupor and mutism, delusions, hallucinations, or a manic syndrome lasting for a brief duration, with full recovery. These symptoms maintain periodicity in rhythm with the menstrual cycle. The symptoms may appear in the premenstrual phase or may begin with the onset of menstrual flow (catamenial psychoses). Usually, menstrual psychosis has a polymorphism of both psychotic and affective symptoms (Brockington I. Menstrual psychosis. World Psychiatry. 2005;4(1):9-17.). In this article we present a case of menstrual psychosis with premenstrual onset. Objectives A 26 years old, nulliparous single female with one mentally ill relative on her mother’s side (her grandmother) presented with an episodic illness characterized by mood swings, irrelevant speech, irritability, suspiciousness and thought disorder related to her menstrual cycles. She had earlier suffered prolonged attacks of mania, developed a recurrent episodic illness which returned every month for five years. Her menses began at 15. She presented with the history of a few episodes of manic illness starting five days before and ending suddenly with the onset of the menses. Methods On mental status evaluation during the index episode, the patient was agitated, had labile affect, grandiose and referential delusions and erotomania. A detailed physical examination, routine biochemistry, and gonadal hormonal assay were unremarkable. Results She was started on olanzapine 10 mg/day, lithium 1200 mg/day and low-dose clonazepam. Although the severity of the psychotic and affective symptoms gradually reduced during the future menstrual cycles, they did not completely resolve. Conclusions The pathophysiology of menstrual psychosis is not exactly understood, but it has been postulated that fluctuation of the sex hormones occurring during the menstrual cycle is responsible. Previous studies have reported the association of psychosis with estrogen withdrawal (Mahé V, Dumaine A. Oestrogen withdrawal associated psychoses. Acta Psychiatr Scand. 2001;104(5):323-331.). Treatment strategies for menstrual psychosis include the use of oral contraceptive pills for the regulation of hormones during the menstrual cycle, in our case patient did not want to use oral contraceptive pills.

      "abstract": "Vomiting is commonly encountered in clinical medicine. When organic gastrointestinal, metabolic, and brain diseases are ruled out, many cases are considered to be functional. We experienced an adult patient with epilepsy whose main symptom was vomiting. Biopsychosocial approaches were needed to control the symptoms.A 26-year-old female with a 10-year history of persistent vomiting was found to have temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). Throughout this time, during which the vomiting had become part of a vicious cycle, her epilepsy was poorly controlled by medication. Biopsychosocial approaches were employed successfully and the patient subsequently undertook training to become a home-helper, started a job, and was able to leave her parents' house and live independently. All of her symptoms resolved after she became self-sufficient.Vomiting without impaired consciousness is seldom considered to be a manifestation of epilepsy. Difficulty in recording an electroencephalogram (EEG) because of the presence of persistent vomiting delayed the diagnosis. The improvement of symptoms was thought to have been due to the patient's emotional stabilization and physical improvement, which may have stabilized the limbic system.When an illness persists for many years and conditioning and a vicious cycle occur secondarily, systematic biopsychosocial approaches are needed in addition to general treatment. Also, secondary symptoms make the diagnosis more difficult when efforts at treatment are ineffective.",

      "title": "What is Psychopathology?",
      "abstract": "Abstract Consider this question. Have you worried a lot over the past month? Answering ‘yes’ may indicate that you are just experiencing normal concern about the usual tribulations oflife. Alternatively, your worrying may be an indicator that you have a mental disorder. Establishing whether worrying is a symptom of a psychiatric disorder, or merely a normal experience, requires answers to a number of supplementary questions such as ‘What’s it like when you worry?’ ‘Can you turn your attention to anything else?’ and ‘How much of the time over the past month have you worried?’ When worrying becomes a recurrent and painful round of thoughts, so that it is difficult to turn your attention to anything else and takes up much of your time, then your worrying is more likely to be a symptom of a mental disorder (Wing et al. 1974).",

      "title": "Melatonin: helping to MEND impaired sleep",
      "abstract": "Many neurodevelopmental disorders adversely affect sleep; children often have difficulty in falling asleep, wake up more often during the night, and sleep less than their typically developing peers. ‘Sleep problems’ were found in 53% of over 300 children with autism, compared with 44% of 63 children with delayed development, and 32% of 163 children with normal (typical) development.1 Sleep problems arise from complex interactions between biological, psychological, social, family and cultural factors. Circadian sleep rhythm disorders (CSRD) may be acute but are more often chronic, and frequently result in associated health problems. CSRDs usually exacerbate any pre-existing learning and behavioural difficulties, and may affect the entire family's whole health and well-being and impair their ability to continue in employment or further education.\n\nThere is considerable pressure for both parents and paediatricians to try and improve a child's disturbed sleep. Management options include behavioural, or pharmacological, or both. Behavioural interventions are probably undervalued, but may be difficult to implement, and may take weeks or months to show any benefit. Conventional medications including hypnotics and sedatives are frequently associated with unacceptable day-time sedation that may adversely affect the child's quality of life. The past 20 years have witnessed the introduction of melatonin which continues to be increasingly prescribed to many children both with and without neurodevelopmental disorders and using a wide range of doses. To many, it is the ubiquitous safe solution to any ‘sleep problem’. The popularity of melatonin reflects the …",

      "title": "Persons with severe dementia and the notion of bodily autonomy*",
      "abstract": "Generally, dementia is a long-lasting and gradual process. While the body often remains strong for a number of years, mental capacities as well as the accumulated competencies and memories of a lifetime gradually slip away. Late stage symptoms include an inability to recognize familiar objects, surroundings, or people, increasing physical frailty, difficulties in eating and swallowing, weight loss, incontinence, and gradual loss of speech and movement control. Reflexes become abnormal and muscles grow rigid. In the end stage, people with dementia lie in bed in a foetus-like position seemingly living as a vegetative organism, being totally dependent on the care of others. This chapter focuses on people with severe dementia, answering the question of what supportive care could contribute to the well-being of these people. It argues that people with severe dementia cannot entirely be denied a (rudimentary) form of selfhood or personhood. They definitively are not persons in the strict sense of moral agents who are self-conscious and rational and demonstrate a minimal moral sense, but at least they can be called persons in a weaker sense.",

The autonomic nervous system plays a major role in both nausea and vomiting. Visceral afferents, principally in the abdominal vagus, provide one of the most important triggers for their induction. The nucleus tractus solitarius in the brainstem is one of the main nuclei involved in processing visceral afferent information and serves to integrate many of the reflex motor events constituting vomiting. The autonomic motor nuclei in the brainstem (e.g. dorsal motor vagal nucleus, nucleus ambiguus, the presympathetic neurons), thoracolumbar and sacral spinal cord are all involved to varying degrees in generating the physiological events accompanying nausea and the motor components of vomiting. The hypothalamic–pituitary axis is involved in the endocrine changes associated with nausea and ‘higher’ brain regions are implicated in the emotional (e.g. amygdala) and sensory experiences (insula)....",

In more severe cases, the child may be in a coma and family members may spend long and often uncertain hours at the child ‘s bedside, disrupting family routines. If and when the child emerges from the coma they may, for example, be unable to walk or talk. A lengthy rehabilitation process may then begin, again requiring family members to spend long periods of time in the hospital and suspend or defer other activities.",

      "abstract": "This entry reviews the health condition known as Roemheld syndrome, or gastrocardiac syndrome in modern medicine. A pathology of gastrointestinal origin, the syndrome relies on a gut–brain–heart triad, interconnected by the vagus nerve. Pressure from the intestines pushes the stomach into the diaphragm and activates the vagus nerve, which affects the heart rate and gives the perception of cardiac issues. This distressing sensation, which usually comes after meals or with other digestive problems, causes anxiety or panic. Although events not arising from anatomic abnormalities are relatively harmless, hypersensitivity to these uncomfortable sensations may precipitate psychiatric problems (anxiety or depression) that cause repeated gastrocardiac events through sympathetic activation and the disruption of peristalsis. Treatment is usually symptomatic and may include diet, lifestyle changes, probiotics, or prescriptions that increase gut motility, but this specific set of reproducible symptoms may also be caused by hiatal hernia or side effects from medication/surgery and treated with respect to those mechanical causes. This review highlights details from the most current knowledge of the condition and offers suggestions for clinical management based on the literature.",

Although the prognosis is thought to be benign, limited long-term follow-up studies exist. This was the objective of our study in addition to exploring the risks of future developmental, behavioral, or neurological abnormalities.Series of consecutive infants with gratification phenomena were identified both retrospectively and prospectively over an eight year period from a single pediatric neurology service. The diagnosis was based on descriptive history, review of videotaped events, lack of neurological or developmental abnormalities, and normal routine electroencephalogram.Nineteen infants were followed for 3-11 years (mean 7.1). Their ages ranged between 4-13 months (mean 7) with 79% females. The diagnosis was not reached by the referring physician and 74% were misdiagnosed as epilepsy or movement disorder. The episodes recurred with variable frequency with gradual reduction in number and increase in length of attack-free periods with advancing age. Complete remission was noted in all patients by age 1-3 years (mean 1.9). However, 4 children (21%) developed features of attention deficit hyperactivity disorders (ADHD) on long-term follow up. In this group, the gratification phenomena appeared at a younger age with higher attack frequency.Gratification phenomena in infants are benign and self-limited, often spontaneously disappearing by two years of age. A correlation with future ADHD was found; however, larger prospective studies are needed to further examine this possible association.",

      "title": "Prevention and diagnosis of neuropathy during dental treatment",
      "abstract": "Peripheral nerves are often subjected to various forces such as surgical invasion, trauma, disease infiltration, and drug action. These attacks cause the peripheral nerve fibers to be pulled, pressed, damaged, or ruptured, resulting in a decline in peripheral function or loss of function. This symptom is often expressed in various ways such as numbness, palsy, paralysis, neuropathy, and nerve abnormality. Paralysis in the oral and facial areas includes motor palsy associated with efferent peripheral neuropathy such as the facial and hypoglossal nerves and sensory palsy associated with afferent peripheral neuropathy such as the inferior alveolar nerve and the lingual nerve. In addition, dysgeusia, taste disorders, dysfunction of autonomic nerves, and autonomic neuropathy may occur in the oral cavity and the facial region as one of paralysis. If these symptoms or disorders recover within days to weeks, it is temporary loss of motor and sensory function due to blockage of nerve conduction, and the diagnosis is neurapraxia. On the other hand, if the symptoms of paralysis persist and the aftereffects remain, or if the function does not recover at all, it can be diagnosed as axonotmesis or neurotmesis. Paralysis is exceedingly difficult to diagnose the prognosis and degree of disability only by the initial symptoms. In particular, the sensory function is more difficult to evaluate than the motor function because the sensory cannot be visualized, and therefore the diagnostic criteria cannot be determined, and inaccurate diagnosis causes confusion in the course of treatment. As a result, despite the definitive diagnosis being Neurapraxia, there is the possibility of giving unnecessary medication, surgical treatment, or wrong physical therapy. Not only that, but for axonotmesis and neurotmesis, which must be treated early, there is a possibility that the start of treatment will be delayed. A quantitative and objective, reproducible and accurate diagnosis is needed to determine the prognosis of paralysis and to make treatment decisions. Accurately grasping the cause of external force applied to the peripheral nerves and the timing of damage, it is possible to cure peripheral functions if the amount and duration of drug therapy and physical therapy and the timing of surgical treatment can be correctly determined. The purpose of this review is to explore preventive and diagnostic methods for peripheral neuropathy during dental treatment. Therefore, we considered the need for a Precision tactile function test for painful trigeminal neuropathy and neuropathic pain, considering the time to fix the symptoms of neuropathy. In addition, we discussed the treatment experience of hyperalgesia and allodynia caused by disorders of the somatosensory nervous system.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Acute confusional state is usually the main diagnosis we encounter in hospitalized older adults. Its incidence increases in parallel with age. Often underdiagnosed. The main characteristics are alteration in the level of consciousness and/or attention, cognitive impairment (disorientation or reduction in memory), relatively rapid onset and fluctuations. As clinical manifestations there is usually disorganization of thought, perceptual disorders, hyper or hypoactivity, alteration of sleep rhythm and alteration of mood. Behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) describes a heterogeneous group of behavioral or mood disturbances, such as agitation, anxiety, depression, psychosis, or sleep disorders. They are universal and are present in dementia of any etiology and can be observed in any phase of the disease. They are considered multifactorial and are characterized by a recurrent or sporadic course. 68-year-old female patient who went to the hospital due to the presentation of symptoms that had been going on for 3 months (memory lapses, insomnia and irritability) that had intensified in recent days, leading to the appearance of visual hallucinations, episodes of disconnection from the environment, their language becomes impoverished and a disintegrated and incoherent speech appears with difficulty in naming. Objectives Propose differential diagnosis between confusional syndrome and psychological and behavioral symptoms of dementia. Methods Analytical: elevation of acute phase reactants. Cranial CT: no findings that justify the diagnostic suspicion. Neurology: despite the sudden onset of the symptoms, they rule out performing LP, given the unremarkable nature of the rest of the complementary tests. It was decided to admit him to mental health to study the condition. The evolution is characterized by a fluctuating picture while the acute phase reactants begin to gradually increase, D-Dimer: 5500 and an ECG with an S1Q3T3 pattern. CT angiography is requested (ruling out PET) Finally, after evaluation by neurology in which new analysis is requested along with urine and culture (+ for C.Glabrata) due to fever peak, lumbar puncture and cranial MRI (small acute ischemic lesions). Finally, it was decided to admit him to neurology with targeted treatment, resulting in resolution of the condition. Results Confusional syndrome with a subacute course of etiology under study. Conclusions BPSD of dementia are multifactorial and include different neurobiological factors, as well as environmental, social and psychological factors. They generally have a recurrent or sporadic character and can appear in all phases of any type of dementia, although they do not usually occur acutely. Therefore, it is important not to lose sight of carrying out complementary tests and a multidisciplinary approach, given that psychopathology of acute-subacute onset should not make us forget to rule out an acute confusional state.

      "abstract": "Colonic motility disorders can be treated by changing the diet, modifying the patient's daily behaviour, giving drugs to enhance or inhibit colonic contraction, or by performing surgery. Therapy in constipation mainly relies on the use of bulk-forming agents, in addition to a change in behaviour. Dietary fibre, particularly bran, appears to be effective in diverticular disease. Bowel atony is largely caused by increased sympathetic activity, and thus frequently responds to sympatholysis. In the irritable bowel syndrome, amelioration is achieved by taking bran and omitting badly tolerated food; antispasmodics and psychotherapy are also probably beneficial. Diarrhoea and incontinence may be treated by opioids, such as loperamide. Recent progress has been mainly in the understanding of the pathophysiology of these disorders, but rapid therapeutic advances are now taking place.",

      "abstract": "| LEADING ARTICLE | PAIN MANAGEMENT IN IBD 1 Address for correspondence: Address for correspondence: Douglas A Drossman, MD, Professor of Medicine and Psychiatry, Co-Director UNC Center for Functional GI and Motility Disorders, 4150 Bioinformatics, CB#7080, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, NC 27599–7080, USA. Email: drossman@med.unc.edu Abdominal pain is a common symptom of IBD [1,2] that may indicate an acute flare and subside with treatment to reduce disease activity. It can arise from several causes such as severe inflammation or abscess formation, or obstruction with secondary gut distension. However, in clinical practice, just as we can see patients with IBD having little or no pain with severe inflammation, we also see patients who experience pain when the disease is inactive. Thus, while there is an association between pain and disease activity in IBD, the degree of association is variable and incomplete. Pathophysiological mechanisms such as neurovisceral sensitization from minimal inflammation, or impaired central modulation of pain via dysregulation of cingulate cortical activity, as seen in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and other functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs), help explain the presence of pain with minimal inflammation [3]. Psychosocial distress can enable these mechanisms in both FGIDs and structural diseases. As IBD is a chronic disease with impairment of quality of life (QoL), there can be a significant burden of psychosocial difficulties in the illness experience of patients with the disease. Therefore, it is important to understand IBD from a biopsychosocial context rather than as an “organic” disorder, where psychosocial relationships may be ignored [4]. This more comprehensive biopsychosocial framework in IBD integrates the histopathological and psychosocial contributions to explain the illness, including symptoms of pain, and permits more effective treatments. In this article, a modern and more comprehensive understanding of pain in IBD that ultimately will improve clinical management is addressed.",

      "abstract": "Treating lower urinary tract dysfunction is a challenging task in patients with neurological disorders such as spinal cord injury (SCI), stroke, Parkinson’s disease, and Multiple Sclerosis. Many of these patients suffer from detrusor overactivity which is a urodynamic observation characterized by involuntary detrusor contractions during the storage phase. Due to the neurological condition it is termed neurogenic detrusor overactivity (NDO). Often NDO is accompanied by detrusor sphincter dyssynergia (DSD), which is a detrusor contraction concurrent with an involuntary contraction of the urethral and/or periurethral striated muscle [1]. These conditions leave the patient with problems during both the storage and the voiding phase of the micturition cycle (e.g. transient high bladder pressures, incontinence and large residual urine).",

      "abstract": "<h3></h3> Individuals living with chronic health conditions are often advised to adopt healthier lifestyles, including improving their nutrition. What is often disregarded by health professionals is that information-giving is often insufficient in supporting maintainable, substantial changes. Making long-term alterations to one9s lifestyle is challenging regardless of one9s circumstances. However, in the context of managing a chronic health condition one is faced with psychological barriers of a specific kind. Individuals with chronic health conditions may dislike being reminded of their physical difficulties, but adhering to a new 9healthier9 schedule means that one remains vigilant of daily choices and is consequently more aware of the underlying health condition. This awareness may result in undesirable emotional states such as sadness or anxiety that one might find difficult to handle. In an effort to then avoid, deny, or numb oneself from the worries or reminders of the chronic illness, it may become increasingly difficult to maintain a healthier lifestyle. The presentation will introduce mindfulness techniques for identifying and better handling undesirable thoughts, emotions and physical sensations that may act as barriers to healthier lifestyles. It will also discuss ways for initiating and maintaining internally motivated lifestyle changes though the activation of one9s personal values rather than acting on mandates of others such as family members or health professionals. <h3>Disclosure of Interest</h3> None declared <h3>DOI</h3> 10.1136/annrheumdis-2014-eular.6127",
