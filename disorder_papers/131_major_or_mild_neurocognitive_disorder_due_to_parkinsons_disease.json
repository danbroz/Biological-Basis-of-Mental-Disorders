      "title": "PARKINSON’S DISEASE- A REVIEW",
      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a disease of insidious onset.The symptoms usually come on slowly over time.(1).Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disease that affects an area of the brain-Substantia nigra.This is age related and non-reversible disease.It mainly affects the motor system and to some extent non-motor system is also involved.Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's disease.It is a progressive disease, which is usually slow.At the onset the most obvious are shaking rigidity, slowness of movements and difficulty with walking and writing.The main motor symptoms are collectively called Parkinsonism or Parkinson's syndrome.Non-motor symptoms are also seen.Thinking and behavioural problems may occur early.(2).Depression and anxiety are also common-occurs in more than one-third of Parkinson's disease.Dementia becomes common in the advanced stage of the disease.Other symptoms are sensory, sleep and emotional problems.The disease is more common in male than female by a ratio of 2: 1.There are two basic types of Parkinson's disease.They are-(1) Idiopathic, and (2) Secondary.Idiopathic Parkinson's disease is more common.In idiopathic Parkinson's disease cause is not known, but genetic and environmental factors are involved.Those with a family history are more prone to suffer from the disease.However, no effective therapy exists till date.The treatment is directed to improve symptoms and slow the progress of the disease.As the disease progresses neurons continue to be lost, these medications become ineffective.Focus of current research is to increase awareness for Parkinson's disease and try to prevent the disease to occur and early diagnosis and management to improve quality of life of patients.The aim is to describe pathophysiology and historical perspective and aware that person suffering from Parkinson's disease can live a normal life.An English doctor James Parkinson published the first detailed description of the disease-\"An Essay of the Shaking Palsy\" in 1817-the disease is named after him-Parkinson's disease.",

      "title": "Integrated pathophysiology of schizophrenia, major depression, and bipolar disorder as monoamine axon disorder",
      "abstract": "Recent studies provide evidence that similar to early-stage Parkinson’s disease, depression is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the degeneration of monoamine axons. The major difference between the two disorders is that the symptoms of depression become evident without loss of monoamine neurons, while the motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease appear after loss of the cell body. Given that the axonal degeneration of monoamine neurons underlies the pathophysiology of neurological (Parkinson’s disease) and neuropsychiatric (depression) diseases, axonal impairment of monoamine neurons is thought to also occur in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and play a significant role in the pathophysiology of these mental illnesses. The positive symptoms of schizophrenia and manic symptoms of bipolar disorder are known to occur in hyper-monoaminergic states, opposite to depressive symptoms, negative/cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia, and motor disorders of Parkinson’s disease, all occurring in hypo-monoaminergic states. Since monoamine axons have the capacity to spontaneously regenerate or sprout in response to damage in the adult brain and sometimes show hyperinnervation due to excessive regeneration/sprouting beyond normal levels, it is possible that schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are disorders that include excessive regeneration/sprouting of monoamine axons leading to hyper-monoaminergic states. Together, based on accumulating data from animal and human studies, the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, major depression, and bipolar disorder is summarized as follows: The degeneration of monoamine axons is associated with the negative and cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia, major and bipolar depression, while hyper-regeneration/sprouting of monoamine axons underlies the positive symptoms of schizophrenia and bipolar mania. The integrated understanding of schizophrenia, major depression, and bipolar disorder as monoamine axon disorder will open the door to the development of new diagnosis and treatment methods for major mental illnesses as well as early-stage Parkinson’s disease.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's syndrome, or parkinsonism, involving the clinical symptoms first described in 1817 by James Parkinson 1, occurs in a variety of disorders of the central nervous system (CNS), and is basically characterized by dysfunction of the dopaminergic nigro-striatal system. It may, or in rare cases it may not, be associated with distinct anatomical damage to melanin-containing neurons of the substantia nigra (SN), changes in the neuronal cytoskeleton including the presence of Lewy bodies, and pathological changes in other neuronal systems, often as part of a more widespread process 2. The term Parkinson's disease (PD) is properly restricted to paralysis agitans, the idiopathic form of parkinsonism, associated with the formation of Lewy bodies and the loss of neurons in the pars compacta of the SN (SNC), which has been known since the time of Tretiakoff 3 as the system principally at risk in this disorder. It can be accompanied by nonspecific or age-related brain pathology, and a variety of other coincidental lesions elsewhere in the CNS.",

      "abstract": "The early diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (idiopathic parkinsonism) is important for two reasons. Some never drugs possibly have a neuroprotective effect, which can be utilized maximally only with early onset of treatment. Moreover, diagnostic mistakes may occur early in the course of the disease. Although the hallmark of Parkinson's disease is a syndrome of movement disorders, slight cognitive deficits, depression, or pain with or without paresthesias can be present at an early stage. Therefore, symptoms at the time of the first diagnosis and at the beginning of the first clinical manifestation of Parkinson's disease are often not identical. The diagnosis can be made only clinically, since no biological marker is available up to now. However, in unclear cases pharmacological tests constitute a valuable extension of the clinical examination.",

However, it has a variable presentation, includ­ing the presence of non-motor symptoms such as cognitive impairment and sleep disturbance. The diagnosis is made clinically by the recognition of these key fea­tures and the exclusion of other causes of parkinsonism. This chapter describes how to recognize the core motor and non-motor features of PD, as well as atypical features that suggest an alternative cause of parkinsonism. The essentials of these alternative diagnoses are outlined, and the list of differentials is structured into sections on other neurodegenerative causes of parkinsonism, secondary causes of parkinsonism, genetic causes of parkinsonism, tremor disorders, and non-neurological differentials of PD.",

Il est à ce jour établi que la triade symptomatique « hypertonie extrapyramidale-tremblement- akinésie » ne peut résumer la complexité du trouble. Parmi les troubles psychiatriques comorbides à la maladie de Parkinson, la dépression est probablement la plus importante en termes de fréquence et d’impact. La prévalence de la dépression est particulièrement élevée, estimée à environ 40 %. Les symptômes dépressifs peuvent être évidents et même précéder les troubles moteurs de la maladie, cependant, le diagnostic d’épisode dépressif est le plus souvent complexe, en raison d’un chevauchement symptomatique des deux troubles. Pouvant inaugurer la maladie de Parkinson ou survenir plus tardivement, la dépression a un retentissement majeur sur l’autonomie fonctionnelle et la qualité de vie des patients. Il existe par ailleurs un lien entre dépression et troubles cognitifs chez les sujets atteints de maladie de Parkinson. La prise en charge de l’épisode dépressif majeur chez un patient présentant une maladie de Parkinson ne fait pas l’objet de recommandation. Les essais cliniques randomisés réalisés sont, à ce jour, trop peu nombreux et les résultats très hétérogènes.

We propose the following diagnostic criteria for PD, i.e., clinical criteria (resting tremor or at least two of the remaining cardinal features of PD), treatment criteria (good response to anti-parkinson drugs), image criteria (essentially normal cerebral MRI), and exclusion criteria (no history of encephalitis or exposure to parkinsonism-inducing substances or drugs).

Depression may be the patient's reaction to Parkinson disease, a condition that is anticipated with anxiety, with good reason as it is often very disabling and has not been significantly prolonged by dopamine therapy. Depression may precede the first signs of Parkinson disease. Pseudoparkinsonian melancholia may be difficult to distinguish from the akinetic form of Parkinson disease. Most of the symptoms of the latter have been encountered in the former. The following features do not occur in depression: astasia with trepidation, festination, monotonous tachyphemia and palilalia, sebaceous hypersecretion, and of course unilateral or frankly asymmetric signs. Parkinson syndrome secondary to depression can be classified with those parkinsonian syndromes that are different from parkinson disease and secondary to a clearcut etiology. In some instances, diagnosis is established by the response to therapy. In the present state of our knowledge, the treatment of depression relies on chemotherapy and sismotherapy and not on dopamine therapy. The management of Parkinson disease rests on dopamine which may be associated with tricylic antidepressants.",

This review describes the clinical characteristics of PD with emphasis on those features that differentiate the disease from other parkinsonian disorders.A MedLine search was performed to identify studies that assess the clinical characteristics of PD. Search terms included \"Parkinson's disease\", \"diagnosis\" and \"signs and symptoms\".Because there is no definitive test for the diagnosis of PD, the disease must be diagnosed based on clinical criteria. Rest tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity and loss of postural reflexes are generally considered the cardinal signs of PD. The presence and specific presentation of these features are used to differentiate PD from related parkinsonian disorders. Other clinical features include secondary motor symptoms (eg, hypomimia, dysarthria, dysphagia, sialorrhoea, micrographia, shuffling gait, festination, freezing, dystonia, glabellar reflexes), non-motor symptoms (eg, autonomic dysfunction, cognitive/neurobehavioral abnormalities, sleep disorders and sensory abnormalities such as anosmia, paresthesias and pain). Absence of rest tremor, early occurrence of gait difficulty, postural instability, dementia, hallucinations, and the presence of dysautonomia, ophthalmoparesis, ataxia and other atypical features, coupled with poor or no response to levodopa, suggest diagnoses other than PD.A thorough understanding of the broad spectrum of clinical manifestations of PD is essential to the proper diagnosis of the disease. Genetic mutations or variants, neuroimaging abnormalities and other tests are potential biomarkers that may improve diagnosis and allow the identification of persons at risk.",

Within the group of parkinsonisms is Parkinson’s disease, also known as neurodegenerative parkinsonian syndrome. The group of atypical parkinsonisms was established due to the existence of sporadic parkinsonisms that do not share the exact etiology of Parkinson’s disease. Additionally, parkinsonisms that arise from causes other than neurodegeneration have been classified as secondary parkinsonisms. With this in mind, given the diversity of etiologies that can trigger parkinsonism, it is crucial to understand the symptomatology and its relationship with the basal ganglia (including damage to the nigrostriatal pathway, neuroinflammation, and neuronal damage). Only then will it be possible to propose appropriate treatments for each variant of parkinsonism.",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics DNAJC6 Parkinson disease is a complex early-onset neurologic disorder whose core features are typical parkinsonian symptoms including bradykinesia, resting tremor, rigidity, and postural instability. The majority of individuals have juvenile onset and develop symptoms before age 21 years. Developmental delay, intellectual disability, seizures, other movement disorders (e.g., dystonia, spasticity, myoclonus), and neuropsychiatric features occur in the majority of individuals with juvenile onset and often precede parkinsonism. The onset of parkinsonian features usually occurs toward the end of the first or beginning of the second decade and the disease course is rapidly progressive with loss of ambulation in mid-adolescence in the majority of individuals. Additional features include gastrointestinal manifestations and bulbar dysfunction. A minority of individuals with DNAJC6 Parkinson disease develop early-onset parkinsonism with symptom onset in the third to fourth decade and absence of additional neurologic features. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of DNAJC6 Parkinson disease is established in a proband with suggestive phenotypic findings and biallelic pathogenic variants in DNAJC6 identified by molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Levodopa, dopaminergic agonists, and/or anticholinergics. Medications and/or surgical interventions for dystonia and spasticity. Medications (e.g., sodium valproate, clonazepam, levetiracetam, piracetam) as needed for myoclonus. Multidisciplinary management including physical and occupational therapy, speech and language therapy, and special education services as indicated for developmental delay and intellectual disability. Seizures are treated with antiepileptic medications. Psychiatric disorders are treated as per neuropsychiatry. Sleep aids (e.g., sleep system, conservative measures, melatonin, sedative medications) as needed for sleep disorder. Feeding support and medications as needed for constipation, sialorrhea, and reflux. Supportive rehabilitation devices and equipment for orthopedic manifestations. Surgical interventions as needed for hip dislocation or kyphoscoliosis. Low-vision therapy, glasses, and surgical intervention as needed for strabismus and/or vision deficits. Surveillance: Physical therapy, occupational therapy, and speech and language therapy evaluations every six months or as needed. Assess for new manifestations such as seizures, changes in tone, and movement disorders at each visit. Repeat electroencephalogram as needed. Monitor those with seizures as clinically indicated. Psychiatric assessment as needed. Sleep study/polysomnography as needed. Growth assessment at each visit in children. Assessment of nutritional status at each visit. Swallowing assessment to evaluate risk of aspiration as needed. Gastroenterology evaluation and gastroscopy as needed. Hip and spine x-ray examination every six months in individuals older than age two years who are nonambulatory and in individuals with signs and symptoms concerning for spinal deformity. Follow-up ophthalmology evaluation for those with vision concerns. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Dopamine antagonists and vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2) inhibitors should be avoided as they could aggravate dopamine deficiency. Genetic counseling DNAJC6 Parkinson disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for a DNAJC6 pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being heterozygous, and a 25% chance of inheriting neither DNAJC6 pathogenic variant. (Note: The risk to heterozygotes of developing manifestations is not yet determined.) Once the DNAJC6 pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, heterozygote testing for at-risk relatives, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk, and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease is a common neurodegenerative disease diagnosed by well established clinical motor symptoms. However, the disease also encompasses many nonmotor issues that can impact a myriad of processes such as cardiovascular status, gastrointestinal function, autonomic function, mood and sleep. These issues can be more debilitating and impactful on health status in part because of a lack of effective treatments. The pathophysiology of the disease process is under active investigation with postulated mechanisms involving both the central nervous system and the periphery. More in depth examination of the many nonmotor symptoms may aid in the discovery of the overarching pathological origin and progression of Parkinson’s disease. Examining the disease process from the perspective of nonmotor symptoms may also provide additional target pathways and potential drug development options not considered previously.

      "abstract": "&lt;abstract&gt; &lt;p&gt;Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease, however, besides the motor symptoms, such as rest tremor, hypokinesia, postural instability and rigidity, PD patients have also non-motor symptoms, namely neuropsychiatric disorders. Apart from the required motor symptoms, psychopathological symptoms are very common and include mood disorders, anxiety disorders, hallucinations, psychosis, cognitive deterioration and dementia. The underlying pathophysiological process in PD is mainly due to the loss of dopaminergic neural cells and thereby causes the shortage of nigrostriatal dopamine content in them. In addition, it may involve other neurotransmitter systems such as the noradrenergic, serotonergic, cholinergic and noradrenergic systems as well. Depression can result from any unhealthy conditions making the diagnosis a challenging task. The manifestation of depression associated with or without PD is inadequate. The co-occurrence of depression and PD often leads to the conceptual discussion on whether depressive symptoms appear before or after PD develops. This paper will discuss the conceptual mechanism of PD and depression. Keep in mind both conditions belong to two separate entities but share some similar aspects in their pathophysiology.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/abstract&gt;",

      "abstract": "In the last decade we have witnessed substantial progress towards the understanding of Parkinson's disease. According to pathological and neuroimaging studies, the traditional view of Parkinson's disease that begins with the development of motor symptoms such as bradykinesia, rigidity and tremor, has begun to change. It is now understood that there would be a \"premotor\" or \"preclinical\" period in which the alphasynuclein pathology begins outside of the substantia nigra in the lower brainstem and autonomic nervous system. Although the pathophysiology of this phase is still unclear, it is currently thought that its symptoms would correspond to the so-called \"non-motor symptoms\". Hyposmia, depression, constipation and REM sleep disorders are one of the most relevant non-motor symptoms at this \"premotor\" stage. The spectrum of non-motor symptoms is very broad and covers the domains of neuropsychiatric, dysautonomic, gastrointestinal and sensory symptoms as well as sleep disorders. Neuropsychiatric symptoms such as depression, impulse control disorder, psychosis and dementia, are a major cause of disability as they are directly related to quality of life.",

      "abstract": "Background: Parkinson’s disease (PD) affects more than 1% of the population aged over 65 years and manifests with both motor symptoms – bradykinesia, rest tremor, rigidity, and non-motor symptoms. Cognitive impairment and dementia are recognized non-motor symptoms that can significantly affect the quality of life of both the patient and caregivers and are a risk factor for institutionalization in nursing homes and a risk factor for early mortality. Cognitive impairment is frequent in Parkinson’s disease (PD) that can develop even before the diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease based on its motor features. Conclusions: There are several clinical, molecular, and imaging factors that constitute risk factors for the development of Parkinson’s disease dementia, in which basal cholinergic and prefrontal dopaminergic systems are involved. Histological changes are Lewy-body, Alzheimer, but also vascular pathology. Clinically can be distinguished subjective cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment and, subsequently, Parkinson’s disease dementia. There are no remedies with a proven effect to prevent the occurrence of cognitive decline in PD. The only approved drug for already developed D-PD is the cholinesterase inhibitor – donepezil. Non-pharmacological interventions are thought to be beneficial. A multidisciplinary approach to cognitive impairment is recommended, with specific pharmaceutical treatment of the cognitive disorder and comorbidities, and appropriate rehabilitation.",

Parkinsonism, defined as the combination of bradykinesia and rigidity (2), may be a predominant clinical feature of several diseases, including idiopathic Parkinson's disease (IPD) and several other entities commonly known as \"Parkinson-plus\" syndromes or atypical parkinsonian disorders (APDs). In these entities, parkinsonism is accompanied by other clinical signs, or red flags (3), that should warn the physician of the existence of a degenerative disorder. Even though rather specific clinical patterns have been described in patients with APDs, such as predominantly autonomic failure, cerebellar, or pyramidal dysfunction, in multiple system atrophy (MSA), axial rigidity, ocular motility disorders, and falls early in the course of the disease, in progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), myoclonus and asymmetrical higher cortical limb dysfunction, in corticobasal degeneration (CBD), and fluctuating cognitive deficits, visual hallucinations, and REM sleep behavior disorder, in diffuse Lewy-body disease (LBD), these signs are not always evident or they may pass unrecognized by nonspecialized neurologists. In some conditions, such as for instance CBD, similar clinical expressions may be common to different pathologies (4), and the same disease may encompass diverse clinical presentations (5). In others, such as MSA with parkinsonian features (MSA-P), patients may behave like IPD until death (6), making it almost impossible to establish a clinical separation between the two diseases. Nowadays, the definite clinical diagnosis still resides in the pathological postmortem examination (1,7,8).",

      "abstract": "<title>Abstract</title> Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurological illness in the world, exactly after Alzheimer's disease. It is the long-term degenerative condition of a human being's central nervous system that primarily affects people over the age of sixty. Parkinson's disease is one of the many neurological conditions that progress over time. Problems with movement are the first symptoms. Initial indicators of the disease could also include vocal dysfunction. Humans diagnosed with Parkinson's have vocal abnormalities that impair their voice's loudness and cause difficulty in pronunciation. As a result, Parkinson's disease can be diagnosed using vocal measures. People may notice issues with common movements, tremors, stiffness in the limbs or trunk, or even decreased balance as neurons (nerve cells) in areas of the brain are weakened, get injured, or die. Patients may struggle with walking, talking, or accomplishing other simple tasks as these symptoms become more noticeable. However, like many other diseases and disorders, these symptoms also appear in other conditions. Thus, it is not necessary for everyone with one or more of these symptoms to have Parkinson's disease. This paper intends to implement 4 base machine learning classifiers and 4 proposed ensemble classifiers to compare and select the best possible model through a dataset of 23 attributes and around 177 records. It is concluded that the ensembles perform far better and are the best interchange between the XG Boost and Random Forest classifier.",

This is an etiologically heterogeneous\r\nentity, which might be due to dysfunctions at various levels in the basal ganglia, and especially\r\nin the substantia nigra (SN) and striatum. The parkinsonism can be classified into four broad\r\ncategories: (i) Parkinson's disease (PD, MIM#168600), also called primary parkinsonism, or typical\r\nparkinsonism, which includes the common, idiopathic form, and the rare forms with a recently\r\ndefined genetic etiology; (ii) parkinsonism-plus syndromes, which include different idiopathic,\r\nbut atypical neurodegenerative forms of parkinsonism (additional motor neurologic features are\r\npresent); (iii) secondary parkinsonism, which is caused by known, non-genetic etiologies, such as\r\nenvironmental insults (drugs, toxins, viruses), inflammation, tissue infiltration/compression or\r\nischemia; (iv) parkinsonism in the context of other degenerative disorders, with or without a known\r\ngenetic cause, in which parkinsonism represents a minor, or occasional component of the clinical\r\npicture (table 1 ).\r\nIn the primary forms of parkinsonism (PD) the initial symptoms occur typically in one side of\r\nthe body, spreading in a few years to the contralateral side. However, a certain degree of clinical\r\nasymmetry persists during the more advanced phases of the disease (the body side where\r\nthe symptoms started remains the more severely affected). Moreover, these motor symptoms\r\ndisplay typically a substantial beneficial response to the therapy with levodopa. While the motor\r\nsymptoms dominate the clinical picture, many PD patients have also other, non-motor problems,\r\nsuch as fatigue, depression, anxiety, sleep disturbances, constipation, bladder and other autonomic\r\ndisturbances, and sensory complaints (2).\r\nThe diagnosis of primary parkinsonism (PD) remains based on the presence of the clinical\r\nsyndrome, and the exclusion of other (secondary) causes.",

It represents one of the main unmet needs of the current management of parkinsonian patients and it is therefore important to encourage any initiative that could improve our understanding of the problem. Patients are usually classified within two clinically defined syndromes: PD with dementia (PDD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB).1,2 Both syndromes present considerable clinical overlap, combining fluctuating subcortical/cortical neuropsychological impairment with neuropsychiatric features and motor parkinsonian symptoms.3 A commonly accepted way to separate these two entities uses a simple 1-year rule: onset of dementia within 1 year of parkinsonism qualifies for DLB while more than 12 months of parkinsonism before dementia onset does so for PDD.4 How relevant such a distinction is remains a matter of debate while most authorities consider that both syndromes represent the motor-onset or the cognitive-onset variants of the same (Lewy body dementia).

Initial estimates based on nigral neuropathological findings or striatal dopamine imaging suggested a 5- to 6-year preclinical period. However, more recent evidence of Lewy body pathology in other neuronal populations preceding nigral involvement suggests that the preclinical phase may be much longer. Epidemiologic studies of nonmotor manifestations, such as constipation, anxiety disorders, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD), and anemia, suggest that the preclinical period extends at least 20 years before the motor manifestations. Olfactory impairment and depression may also precede the onset of motor manifestations; however, the lag time may be shorter. Recognition of a nonmotor preclinical phase spanning 20 or more years should guide the search for predictive biomarkers and the identification of risk or protective factors for Parkinson disease.",

PD with dementia (PDD) is defined as onset of dementia more than 1 year after the onset of parkinsonism. If dementia precedes or occurs less than 1 year after the onset of parkinsonism, a diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is made. There is essentially no difference in the pathology of PDD and DLB at autopsy, indicating that Braak's hypothesis, which is extracted from PD/PDD and excluding DLB, may be bias. REM-related behavioral disorder (RBD) or depression, the main locus of which is the brain stem, could precede or occur after the onset of PD or DLB, indicating a descending and ascending path of Lewy body (LB) pathology. A disturbance in olfaction usually precedes the onset of PD. Recent data indicate that severe olfactory dysfunction in PD is an indication of a high probability of mental decline. These clinical observations and our pathological reports support the presence of an olfactory-amygdala extension path of LB pathology in addition to Braak's hypothesis. Our pathological studies of consecutive autopsy cases showed that the involvement of autonomic ganglia was more frequent than that of the gastrointestinal tract, suggesting that initial the stage of LB pathology in Braak's hypothesis should be modified.",

En la enfermedad de Parkinson hay pacientes con deficit cognitivo aislado y multiple y el rendimiento cognitivo forma un abanico que va desde la normalidad hasta un avanzado grado de demencia. La mayoria de los enfermos presenta un deficit ejecutivo, aislado o combinado con otras alteraciones cognitivas, que se considera lo mas caracteristico de la enfermedad, y un 30-40% de afectados acabara presentando una demencia clinicamente definida. Desarrollo. La presencia de alteracion cognitiva leve en los enfermos parkinsonianos significa la existencia de un riesgo elevado de aparicion de demencia en el transcurso de la enfermedad. La demencia asociada con enfermedad de Parkinson esta especificamente relacionada con sintomatologia neuropsiquiatrica, que puede tener tres posibles explicaciones: alteracion de vias mesolimbicas, alteracion cortical y limbica difusa, o fenomenologia de tipo Alzheimer asociada. Los episodios psicoticos se presentan preferentemente en los pacientes con tratamiento dopaminergico y el espectro clinico de la psicosis parkinsoniana abarca: ilusiones visuales, alucinaciones visuoaudioolfatorias, delirio y psicosis alucinatoria paranoide grave. Todos los farmacos antiparkinsonianos pueden provocar alucinaciones y psicosis, pero los agonistas dopaminergicos detentan la mayor capacidad. Conclusiones. En el manejo de esta problematica es muy importante la prevencion y el diagnostico y tratamiento tan pronto hagan aparicion.

Risk factor or indicators are advanced age at disease onset, disease duration, rigidity, akinesia and posture and gait impairment and falls as opposed to tremor dominance, and associated neuropsychiatric symptoms (depression, apathy, hallucinosis, delirium).

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a common movement disorder associated with considerable disability. The clinical syndrome of parkinsonism is based on the presence of core clinical features of rest tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity and impaired postural reflexes or gait. Parkinsonism is most often caused by Parkinson's disease, but can also be caused by other disorders, including cerebrovascular disease, multiple-system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy and other disorders. Parkinsonism can be identified by questionnaires and confirmed in person or by videotaped clinical examinations. The identification of presymptomatic cases remains problematic but is motivated by the hope for treatment before symptoms appear. Quantitative approaches to the diagnosis of parkinsonism based on the measurement of the cardinal features are available. Clinical approaches should include identification of features atypical for Parkinson's disease, which exclude the diagnosis, and documentation of a response to dopaminergic medications, which support a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. Loss of smell and visual dysfunction are found in early patients and may be useful in screening protocols. In addition, behavioral changes, including depressive symptoms, may be detected in presymptomatic cases. Cognitive changes, such as impaired set shifting, have been observed in early Parkinson's disease, but can be seen with other causes of parkinsonism. Neuroimaging techniques, including positron emission tomography or single-photon emission computed tomography, are available to quantify dopaminergic neurons, while magnetic resonance imaging may be helpful in differentiating other forms of parkinsonism from Parkinson's disease. There are numerous approaches available to the identification of parkinsonism and Parkinson's disease. The gold standard remains a clinical diagnosis, confirmed by autopsy.",

      "title": "300 - Increasing Complexity Awareness of Parkinson Disease Psychosis: Risk Factors, Symptoms, Diagnosing &amp; Management",
      "abstract": "Background: After Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’ disease (PD) is the second most common age-related neurodegenerative disorder globally. Approximately 1 million individuals in the United States (US) have PD; every year 60,000 more Americans are diagnosed. PD is a movement disorder caused by dopamine insufficiency in the substantia nigra. The disease process is complicated by falls, constipation, dysphagia, insomnia, anxiety, depression, and behavioral/cognitive disorders. Upon diagnosis, evidence-based symptom management should include individualized nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic interventions along with lifestyle changes that will promote positive outcomes. More than 50% of persons diagnosed with PD develop psychotic symptoms. Parkinson’s disease psychosis (PDP) is a non-motor symptom and consists primarily of hallucinations and delusions. PDP is caused by neurotransmitter changes in the brain, some related to long-term use of parkinsonian medications. In many cases, PDP symptoms are mis-diagnosed as a chronic co-morbid condition, such as mild cognitive impairment or dementia. Symptoms run from benign to aggressive. Undiagnosed and untreated symptoms can accelerate. Delirium caused by medications or infections may contribute to psychosis. Rapid Eye Movement Sleep (REMS) Disorder associated with PD results in daytime sleepiness and acting out dreams. All symptoms profoundly impact formal and informal care partners. When underlying causes are identified by expert clinicians, symptoms may be reversible. There are many evidence-based paths to follow such as managing polypharmacy, appropriate prescribing patterns, and the effective use of nonpharmacologic interventions. Conclusion: During this symposium the complexities of the disease are addressed including the toll PDP can have on the person living with PD, their care partner(s) and the interdisciplinary health care team. It is imperative clinicians can simultaneously manage the overlapping motor symptoms and PDP to prevent physical and mental disabilities and improve quality of life. After attending this session, clinicians will be able to provide quality care to individuals living with PDP and their care partners.",

Although parkinsonian symptoms in the parkinsonism associated with brain tumors are similar to those seen in Parkinson's disease in the early stages, atypical symptoms, such as visual field defects, motor weakness or pyramidal signs are visible signs of the parkinsonism. Functional abnormality in the nigrostrial system due to chronic mechanical compression of the system by a sizeable brain tumor seems to contribute to the pathogenesis of the parkinsonism.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease (PD) is an increasingly prevalent neurodegenerative disorder currently diagnosed solely on the presence of motor symptoms (i.e., tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability) and their response to dopamine replacement therapy. A major unmet need is the limited number and failure of clinical trials with putative neuroprotective agents intended to halt or delay disease progression. Three main reasons account for this development: ( i ) At the time of the clinical diagnosis >50% of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra have degenerated (1) and other neurotransmitter systems (e.g., norepinephrine, serotonin and acetylcholine) have been affected, indicating that the disease is already at an advanced stage (2); ( ii ) some reports suggest low accuracy for a PD clinical diagnosis, with up to 50% misdiagnosis in early disease (i.e., within 5 y of diagnosis) (3); and ( iii ) there is still no objective meaningful endpoint for clinical trials for early PD other than the Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS), a rater-based assessment of symptom severity. Thus, there is a need for objective biomarkers that either are neuropathophysiological manifestations of the disease (marker of state), track the speed of its progression (marker of rate), or are present in at-risk PD (marker of trait) (4). Adding complexity to this endeavor is the fact that PD is very heterogeneous in its clinical, neuropathological, and probably also pathophysiological presentation, with various subtyping strategies based on motor and also nonmotor symptoms recently proposed (5).

      "abstract": "Abstract Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by movement dysfunction due to selective degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Non-motor symptoms of PD (e.g., sensory dysfunction, sleep disturbance, constipation, neuropsychiatric symptoms) precede motor symptoms, appear at all stages, and impact the quality of life, but they frequently go unrecognized and remain untreated. Even when identified, traditional dopamine replacement therapies have little effect. We discuss here the pathology of two PD-associated non-motor symptoms: olfactory dysfunction and depression. Olfactory dysfunction is one of the earliest non-motor symptoms in PD and predates the onset of motor symptoms. It is accompanied by early deposition of Lewy pathology and neurotransmitter alterations. Because of the correlation between olfactory dysfunction and an increased risk of progression to PD, olfactory testing can potentially be a specific diagnostic marker of PD in the prodromal stage. Depression is a prevalent PD-associated symptom and is often associated with reduced quality of life. Although the pathophysiology of depression in PD is unclear, studies suggest a causal relationship with abnormal neurotransmission and abnormal adult neurogenesis. Here, we summarize recent progress in the pathology of the non-motor symptoms of PD, aiming to provide better guidance for its effective management.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) may present neuropsychiatric and conduct disorders at different stages of the development of the disease that make treatment even more difficult. Development The neurologist must be on the lookout for the possible appearance of alterations affecting impulse control, even from the early stages of the disease, so as to be able to prevent them or to plan a suitable adjustment of treatment. Some of the most common impulsivity disorders include hypersexuality, compulsive gambling and other addictive behaviours which, if left undetected and untreated, can end up having a destructive effect on the patient's socio-familial surroundings. Psychotic disorders (hallucinations, delusions) are often associated to advanced phases of PD and to the effect of dopamine therapy, and they are associated to a higher morbidity and mortality rate. Factors of a genetic or pharmacogenetic nature or a gene-environment interaction may account for the different individual susceptibility to disorders in the neuropsychiatric realm among patients with PD. It is wise to bear in mind the possible medico-legal implications that may stem from behavioral disorders, both for the patient and his or her family and for the physician, because situations could arise that trigger conflicts between confidentiality and preventing third parties from being harmed, as well as harm that can be attributed to the side effects of medicines. Conclusions The specialist must be familiar with, foresee and propose suitable treatment for behavioral and neuropsychiatric disorders in PD with potential medico-legal implications.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a relatively common neurological disorder with a prevalence rate of 1–3% in people over the age of 65 years. Given the increasing age of our population, it is expected that the prevalence of PD in the general population will rise steadily over time. The clinical syndrome of parkinsonism is characterized by the existence of at least two of the following symptoms: bradykinesia, rigidity, or tremor. Although clinical signs of parkinsonism can be observed in conditions such as multiple system atrophy (MSA), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and Alzheimer’s disease (AD), as well as medication-induced syndromes, it is most commonly observed in patients with classical PD. Neuropathologically, PD is characterized by neurodegeneration of dopamine-containing neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc). However, the onset of parkinsonian symptoms manifests only after histopathologically advanced stages have been reached. In addition to SNc neurodegeneration, another hallmark of postmortem diagnosis in presymptomatic and symptomatic stages of PD is the development of specific eosinophilic inclusion bodies (i.e. Lewy bodies). Lewy bodies contain an aggregated form of the normal presynaptic protein, a-synuclein. The occurrence of Lewy bodies in postmortem investigation is not solely confined to PD, as they are present in other syndromes such as MSA and Hallervorden–Spatz disease. However, the pattern and distribution of Lewy bodies in such syndromes differ from PD.",

Andere neurodegenerative Erkrankungen sind mit einer leichten oder masigen Riechminderung verbunden.\r\nBeim idiopathischen Parkinson‐Syndrom ist die olfaktorische Storung ein sehr haufiges Symptom, welches bei 80‐90% der Betroffenen auftritt. Eine Riechstorung kann bei einer Person, die unter dem idiopathischen Parkinson‐Syndrom (IPS) leidet unabhangig\r\nvon Alter, Geschlecht und Dauer der Erkrankung auftreten.\r\nMit psychophysischen Riechtests (z.B. „Sniffin´ Sticks“) kann eine olfaktorische Storung schnell erkannt werden. Diese ist besonders in der Fruhdiagnostik von\r\nneurodegenerativen Erkrankungen von groser Bedeutung, denn nur so besteht eine Chance fur eine potenzielle Neuroprotektion im noch prasymptomatischen\r\nKrankheitsstadium‐ vor Auftreten motorischer Symptome. Hier steht folgende Beobachtung im Vordergrund: neurodegenerative Prozesse beginnen im olfaktorischen System und im Hirnstamm und befallen erst dann spezifische\r\nHirnregionen.

Additionally, non-motor symptoms such as pain and gastrointestinal dysregulation are also common in PD. These impairments might stem from a dysregulation within the gut-brain axis that alters immunity and the inflammatory state and subsequently drives neurodegeneration. There is increasing evidence linking gut dysbiosis to the severity of PD’s motor symptoms as well as to somatosensory hypersensitivities. Altogether, these interdependent features highlight the urgency of reviewing the links between the onset of PD’s non-motor symptoms and gut immunity and whether such interplays drive the progression of PD. This review will shed light on maladaptive neuro-immune crosstalk in the context of gut dysbiosis and will posit that such deleterious interplays lead to PD-induced pain hypersensitivity.",

Idiopathic Parkinson's disease is most confidently clinically diagnosed if we follow the United Kingdom Parkinson's Disease Society Brain Bank Diagnostic Criteria for Parkinson's disease. The most common degnerative diseases, which minic idiopathic Parkinson's disease are collectively called Parkinson plus syndrome. The most important diseases comprising Parkinson plus syndrome are: progressive supranuclear palsy, multiple system atrophy, cortical-basal ganglionic degneration, diffuse Lewy body disease and Parkinson-dementia-ALS complex. In India the prevalence of Parkinson's disease varied markedly from one study to another. The prevalence rate is high among the urban Parsi community of Mumbai. Incidence and prevalence of Parkinson's disease increase with increasing age. Some risk factors for Parkinson's disease have been narrated briefly.

The underlying disease pathogenesis between these motor and non-motor features share some commonality, with possible candidates including neurotransmitter dysfunction and abnormal amyloid metabolism, in addition to Lewy body burden. This chapter discusses the motor phenotype associated with dementia in Parkinson’s disease (PD-D), which includes more axial disease, balance impairment, and greater fall frequency, in addition to sleep disorders and autonomic disturbance. As the milestone of PD-D is reached, deterioration in motor disease and diminished levodopa response is more likely to occur, and this is further explored. Lastly, motor phenotype, specifically the postural instability and gait disorder (PIGD) phenotype, is discussed in relation to future risk of cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment.",

      "abstract": "La enfermedad de Parkinson (EP), la enfermedad de Parkinson con Demencia (EPD) y la Demencia con Cuerpos de Lewy (DCL) presentan una alteracion del metabolismo de la alfa-sinucleina que provoca la formacion de agregados proteicos llamados Cuerpos de Lewy. Las sinucleinopatias son la segunda causa de demencia degenerativa despues de la enfermedad de Alzheimer. Se caracterizan neuropatologicamente por inclusiones de alfa-sinucleina en el tronco cerebral, nucleos subcorticales, areas neocorticales y limbicas, y clinicamente por demencia, alteraciones atencionales, parkinsonismo y comunmente alucinaciones visuales.Dado que la DCL y la EPD presentan un solapamiento clinico, se ha argumentado que pueden representar la misma enfermedad. La DCL se diagnostica cuando la demencia ocurre antes o de manera paralela al parkinsonismo, mientras que el termino EPD es usado para describir la demencia que ocurre en el contexto de una EP bien establecida.La presente tesis doctoral consta de dos estudios los objetivos de los cuales fueron establecer las diferencias en sustancia gris cerebral entre DCL y EPD mediante la tecnica de analisis voxel-based morphometry aplicada a imagenes de resonancia magnetica potenciada en T1, asi como determinar las diferencias en perfil cognitivo en estos grupos de pacientes. Asimismo, en el primer estudio, se evaluo la relacion entre las estructuras cerebrales y las funciones cognitivas en estos pacientes, y en el segundo estudio, se evaluaron los correlatos neuroanatomicos de las alucinaciones visuales, asi como su correlacion con el funcionamiento cognitivo en este grupo de pacientes.Para ello se estudiaron un total de 12 pacientes diagnosticados de DCL, 16 pacientes con EPD y 16 controles sanos apareados por edad y sexo, mediante una secuencia de RM 3D potenciada en T1 adquirida en un escaner de 1.5 Tesla y una evaluacion neuropsicologica y conductual.Las conclusiones que se derivan de este estudio son las siguientes:Los pacientes con DLC y EPD presentan un patron diferente de atrofia regional. En comparacion con los controles, los pacientes con EPD presentan mayor reduccion en areas parieto-occipitales y los pacientes con DCL en areas frontales, temporales y parietales. Ademas, los pacientes con DCL tienen una mayor perdida de sustancia gris que los EPD en diversas areas frontales, en concreto en las circunvoluciones frontal inferior, frontal superior y premotora.En los analisis individuales, los pacientes con DCL y los pacientes con EPD presentan una perdida de sustancia gris hipocampal bilateral, pero solo la frecuencia de la reduccion hipocampal derecha fue significativamente mayor en DCL que en EPD.La presencia de alucinaciones visuales se relaciona con una reduccion de la sustancia gris en regiones frontales en ambos grupos, pero en diferentes areas. En los pacientes con DCL en la circunvolucion frontal inferior y en la EPD en la region orbitofrontal. Asimismo, la severidad y frecuencia de las alucinaciones visuales correlaciona negativamente con el volumen de la circunvolucion frontal inferior y el precuneus.En el perfil atencional, los pacientes con DCL presentan mayor distractibilidad, caracterizada por menor vigilancia, mientras que los pacientes con EPD presentan mayor impulsividad, reflejada por errores intrusivos y perseverativos.En el grupo con DCL, el deficit de memoria visual se correlaciona con un decremento del volumen del area temporal medial derecha (hipocampo y amigdala) y los deficits atencionales correlacionan con una perdida del volumen del cingulado anterior, frontal inferior y prefrontal dorsolateral bilateralmente. En este mismo grupo, la presencia y severidad de las alucinaciones visuales se relaciona con una alteracion de la fluencia verbal semantica, del control inhibitorio de la atencion y de las funciones visuoperceptivas, mientras que en los pacientes con EPD se relaciona con deficits en memoria visual.La conclusion final, es que en los dos grupos con demencia, hay un patron de perdida de sustancia gris y un perfil cognitivo diferencial. Asimismo, cada patologia presenta un patron distinto de correlaciones entre sustancia gris y conducta.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a Neurodegenerative disease, the prevalence of which in India is estimated at around 1.3-1.5% for the population aged 60 years or above.In a ranking that listed the top 10 of the most disabling chronic diseases, Parkinson's disease was ranked second, both in the list of physical disorder and the list of mental disorder.Parkinson's disease is also known as Shaking Palsy, Idiopathic Parkinsonism, Primary Parkinsonism, or Paralysis Agitans.It is a progressive degenerative disorder of the Central Nervous System.Movements are mainly affected early in the course of the disease.1It is characterized by motor impairments, including Bradykinesia, Tremor, Postural Instability and Rigidity.These motor abnormalities may also be accompanied by changes in cognition for a significant proportion of patients.While a minority of Parkinson's patients will develop frank dementia, most patients with Parkinson's disease patients will experience changes in cognitive function, frequently early in the course of their illness.2Design & Methodology: Patients who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were taken up for the study purpose.Written consent regarding their voluntary participation in the study was taken.The purpose of the study and procedure was explained to the subjects.Initially all the patients were given 2-3 trial sessions for practice for Purdue peg board test.All the patients first performed the motor task and there score was taken, according to the number of pegs placed in a peg board in 30 sec and documented as a motor task.Next all the patients performed two motor tasks simultaneously.In these patients were given a ball squeezing activity along with a Purdue pegboard test for a period of 30 sec and documented as motor and motor task.Finally all the patients performed a cognitive task along with a motor task .In these patients were given a verbal cognitive task based on a questionnaire along with a Purdue pegboard test for a period of 30sec and documented as cognitive and motor task. Result:The present study shows that both Motor + Motor task and Motor + Cognitive task both shows interference on hand dexterity in Parkinson's patients.Clinically there was a significant difference in Motor, Motor + Motor And Motor + Cognitive Task when compared in all the stages of Parkinson's patients. Conclusion:This study concludes that Parkinson's disease patients have more difficulty in performing motor and cognitive task than motor and motor task I.",

PD is associated with a loss of cells in the basal ganglia of the brain, especially in the substantia nigra. Cognitive impairments are also common in PD, especially problems with executive functioning. PD is just one possible cause of parkinsonism; diagnosing PD requires ruling out these other causes. Examples of other causes of parkinsonism include: antipsychotic medications may cause parkinsonian symptoms, multiple system atrophy, and dementia with Lewy bodies. Dopamine agonist treatment for PD may be associated with the development of pathological obsessions that take on extreme proportions. The average age of onset for PD is between 55 and 65.

      "title": "Multicausality as an Increase in the Latency Period for the Diagnosis of Parkinson's Disease in Primary Care: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "Background: Parkinson's disease was described for the first time by James Parkinson in 1817 in the trial \"Shaking Palsy,\" and thus there is also evidence of this disease in the Indian medical system 4500 years ago, for the diagnosis and its management with Mucuna pruriens.Years later, it was subsequently determined to contain levodopa. Two types of manifestations of Parkinson's disease are currently known, such as motor and non-motor, the first being the one that usually leads to diagnosis. Success in this will depend on the skill of the primary care physician, the ability to recognize the first symptoms by the patient, and the health systems in the management of care for the timely referral. This work shows the comprehensive management of a patient who arrives at Primary Care services, presenting vague and specific symptoms. These symptoms were treated with medications or remedies in order to calm the condition temporarily. It is convenient to call the specific symptoms such as headache, nausea, pain, dizziness, tiredness and weakness, poor motivation, sadness, easy crying, and sleep disturbances; A large percentage go to their health centers for presenting motor alterations, many times identified by their relatives or by themselves and despite being recognized as something abnormal, many of them come when the tremor intervenes with the activities of daily life. At this point, the management of the disease would begin, making clear the importance of education for the population to attend abnormal situations on time and not in late stages, significantly improving the quality of life or the prognosis of the disease Parkinson's, as is the case that occurred in our institution; A 64-year-old female patient who presents with tremor in the fifth finger of the right hand, she mentions that it is more intense when there are apparently stress situations, hyposmia and sleep disturbances, going to different health centers where they were controlled the discomfort with essential medications, many of these not requiring a prescription, temporarily decreasing in intensity; This being the beginning of multi-causality for proper management from considering the first contact doctor as a resource manager with the use of diagnostic skills to recognize characteristic signs in early stages of the disease and the ability to maintain continuity with the patients and their families as a model of family system. Studies were determined that non-motor manifestations could appear months or years before they manifest as motor symptoms to give comprehensive management to patients from their first contact with the health centers closest to them. The diagnostic presumption and its referral to the neurology and timely treatment service, until evaluating the functionality and efficacy of health policies, avoiding the delay in pharmacological treatment and access to specific neuroimaging studies at any stage of the disease. Objective: The objective of this report is to present a clinical case of a patient diagnosed with Parkinson's disease, from its management in the first contact medical services to have comprehensive management by a neurologist, thus in this way the period of latency to start treatment. Methods: We present a clinical case of a 64-year-old patient who came to consultation due to a tremor in the fifth finger of the right hand.A review of her medical history is performed, and management by different specialties is identified, for mood disorders, insomnia, essential tremor in addition to allergic rhinitis, already with drug treatment with slight or no improvement. The patient underwent a neurological examination and imaging and laboratory studies. She was referred to the neurology service as soon as possible. Result: After the interrogation and physical examination, the patient was referred to the Neurology service to confirm the presumption of diagnosis as a movement disorder under study. This process is often called the \"latency period\" of the diagnosis. The present work is shown as a decisive factor in giving a verdict on this problem. It is known that this level of resolution takes into account the pillars of first contact medicine as health resource managers. In this way, pharmacological treatment was started with a decrease in tremor as a motor symptom and an increase in quality and amount of sleep, increased mood, and affect as non-motor symptoms. Conclusion: The patient is under established medical and pharmacological control, and the long diagnostic latency period could be evidenced, as it usually happens in many movement disorders or their early stages, in this case, Parkinson's disease. Likewise, the family doctor is an instrument that allows the resolution of more than 90% of health problems in general, and the proper management of the remaining percentage is multifactorial, as well as medical skill and experience, the capacity of the patient or the family members. in recognizing early-stage motor disorders and health systems that often make a referral to other medical specialties difficult.",

Neurochemically, irrespective of the presence or absence of Alzheimer-type brain pathology, demented Parkinson patients seem to have the same disturbance of cortical cholinergic neuron function as patients with Alzheimer-type dementia (Alzheimer's disease), namely, reduced levels of cortical acetylcholine esterase and choline acetyltransferase activity. At present, the question whether the \"cortical cholinergic deficiency\" is the only (or sufficient) neurochemical basis for the cognitive impairment in Parkinson patients with dementia cannot be answered with certainty; the additional role of other neurotransmitter changes known to occur in the Parkinson brain, especially loss of cortical, hippocampal and subcortical noradrenaline and/or dopamine cannot be ruled out.",

      "title": "[Pain and sensory disturbance in Parkinson disease].",
      "abstract": "Pain or sensory symptoms are a frequent complaint in Parkinson disease (PD), which reduce health-related quality of life (QOL) and interfere with patient's ability to participate in activities of daily living, thus contributing to sleep disturbance or major depression. The frequency of pain is thought to have a bimodal distribution. The initial peak seems to occur before, or at the onset of PD and a second peak occurs later in the disease course in conjunction with the development of motor fluctuations or dyskinesia. The spectrum of sensory symptoms is wide, and the most common sites that experience pain are the back, legs, and shoulders. In cases, pain occurs on the side that is more affected by parkinsonism; however unusual distributions, such as oral or genital pain syndrome, chest pain, and upper or lower abdominal discomfort may be observed. The etiological basis of PD-related pain is multifactorial, with varying degrees of contribution from peripheral and central sources. Central mechanisms include derangement of the intrinsic pain-modulating monoaminergic mechanism in addition to plastic central nervous system changes induced by chronic anti-parkinsonian medication. The importance of dopaminergic deficits as a causal factor in PD-related pain is supported by the normalization of these abnormalities after L-dopa administration, which suggests that the human striatum plays a central role in processing nociceptive information. Nevertheless, the lack of response to dopaminergic agents in some patients suggests the involvement of non-dopaminergic structures in PD. Abnormalities of noradrenergic and serotonergic pathways descending to the spinal cord are assumed to play a role in pain perception in PD. Some reports have highlighted the problem of delayed diagnosis in PD patients with an initial presentation of pain. Greater awareness of this possibility among physicians is important. Physicians also should bear in mind that psychological factors are major components of pain and that patient education and support are critical to successful treatment.",

      "title": "Diagnosis and Treatment of Parkinson Disease",
      "abstract": "<h3>Importance</h3> Parkinson disease is the most common form of parkinsonism, a group of neurological disorders with Parkinson disease–like movement problems such as rigidity, slowness, and tremor. More than 6 million individuals worldwide have Parkinson disease. <h3>Observations</h3> Diagnosis of Parkinson disease is based on history and examination. History can include prodromal features (eg, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, hyposmia, constipation), characteristic movement difficulty (eg, tremor, stiffness, slowness), and psychological or cognitive problems (eg, cognitive decline, depression, anxiety). Examination typically demonstrates bradykinesia with tremor, rigidity, or both. Dopamine transporter single-photon emission computed tomography can improve the accuracy of diagnosis when the presence of parkinsonism is uncertain. Parkinson disease has multiple disease variants with different prognoses. Individuals with a diffuse malignant subtype (9%-16% of individuals with Parkinson disease) have prominent early motor and nonmotor symptoms, poor response to medication, and faster disease progression. Individuals with mild motor-predominant Parkinson disease (49%-53% of individuals with Parkinson disease) have mild symptoms, a good response to dopaminergic medications (eg, carbidopa-levodopa, dopamine agonists), and slower disease progression. Other individuals have an intermediate subtype. For all patients with Parkinson disease, treatment is symptomatic, focused on improvement in motor (eg, tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia) and nonmotor (eg, constipation, cognition, mood, sleep) signs and symptoms. No disease-modifying pharmacologic treatments are available. Dopamine-based therapies typically help initial motor symptoms. Nonmotor symptoms require nondopaminergic approaches (eg, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for psychiatric symptoms, cholinesterase inhibitors for cognition). Rehabilitative therapy and exercise complement pharmacologic treatments. Individuals experiencing complications, such as worsening symptoms and functional impairment when a medication dose wears off (\"off periods\"), medication-resistant tremor, and dyskinesias, benefit from advanced treatments such as therapy with levodopa-carbidopa enteral suspension or deep brain stimulation. Palliative care is part of Parkinson disease management. <h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3> Parkinson disease is a heterogeneous disease with rapidly and slowly progressive forms. Treatment involves pharmacologic approaches (typically with levodopa preparations prescribed with or without other medications) and nonpharmacologic approaches (such as exercise and physical, occupational, and speech therapies). Approaches such as deep brain stimulation and treatment with levodopa-carbidopa enteral suspension can help individuals with medication-resistant tremor, worsening symptoms when the medication wears off, and dyskinesias.",

We excluded patients who had not been diagnosed by a neurologist, and who had a pre-existing diagnosis of PD, psychogenic, or secondary dystonia. Records were subdivided into those who later developed PD or Parkinson-plus disorders and those who did not. The following clinical characteristics were compared between the two groups: dystonia onset age, type of dystonia, levodopa response, anticholinergic response, and family history of Parkinsonism or tremor.Twenty-two AOPLLD patients were identified: 77% female; the median dystonia onset age was 53 years. Eight (37%) developed Parkinson's disease; 2 (9%) developed corticobasal syndrome. Twelve patients (54%) did not develop Parkinsonism after a median follow-up period of 1.5 years.

Auch Fluktuationen des Bewusstseins und die Entwicklung einer Demenz im frühen Stadium des Erkrankungsverlaufs sprechen gegen ein IPS. Neben diesen klinischen Kriterien helfen strukturelle und funktionelle bildgebende Verfahren sowie Untersuchungen der L-Dopa-Sensitivität der Parkinson-Syndrome und des autonomen Nervensystems, die diagnostische Sicherheit zu erhöhen. In dieser Übersicht wird eine Empfehlung für das rationale diagnostische Vorgehen entworfen.",

Neben diesen kognitiven Auffälligkeiten kennzeichnen psychiatrische Begleiterscheinungen z.B. Depression das Krankheitsbild. Bei Parkinson Patienten ohne Demenz scheinen diese Defizite in frühen Erkrankungsstufen unabhängig von der Motorik zu sein und die Alltagskompetenz der Patienten wenig zu beeinflussen. Verschiedene Untersuchungen weisen darauf hin, dass diese kognitiven Defizite und Verhaltensauffälligkeiten bereits vor dem Auftreten der ersten motorischen Symptome nachzuweisen sind. Die Erfassung spezifischer bei der Parkinson-Erkrankung typischerweise veränderter kognitiver Leistungen ist daher sowohl im Frühstadium der Erkrankung wie möglicherweise auch in der prämotorischen Diagnostik von Bedeutung.",

Studies showed that several non-motor symptoms, such as olfactory dysfunction, constipation, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, depression and fatigue, can occur before the onset of motor symptoms. Fatigue has been considered as one of the most disabling symptoms, and it has a significant impact on activity of daily living and quality of life, and brings heavy burdens to caregivers. However, fatigue in PD has no special biomarkers, so clinicians are lack of the recognition and intervention.

      "abstract": "Age is the largest risk factor for the development and progression of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Ageing affects many cellular processes that predispose to neurodegeneration, and age-related changes in cellular function predispose to the pathogenesis of PD. The accumulation of age-related somatic damage combined with a failure of compensatory mechanisms may lead to an acceleration of PD with age. The formation of Lewy bodies may represent a marker for protective mechanisms against age-related dysfunction and degeneration of the nervous system. Mild parkinsonian signs may be present in older people, which are associated with reduced function. These may be due to age-related decline in dopaminergic activity, incidental Lewy body disease, degenerative pathologies (early PD and Alzheimer’s disease) or vascular pathology. Ageing may affect the clinical presentation of PD with altered drug side effects, increased risk of developing dementia and an increased likelihood of admission to a nursing home. Progression of PD, including the development of dementia, and hallucinations is related to the age of the patient rather than the age of disease onset. PD may reflect a failure of the normal cellular compensatory mechanisms in vulnerable brain regions, and this vulnerability is increased by ageing. PD is one of the best examples of an age-related disease.",

Clinical symptoms of PD consist of resting tremor, muscular rigidity, bradykinesia, and abnormal postural reflexes (1). The pathologic hallmark of PD is the progressive degeneration of the nigrostriatal pathway and dopaminergic cells of the substantia nigra (2) though recent neuropathologic studies suggest a more extended neuronal degeneration starting in the medulla oblongata that later spreads to the midbrain and cerebral cortex (3). Nevertheless it is the degeneration of the nigrostriatal pathway and subsequent dopamine deficiency in striatum that is believed to underlie many of the clinical manifestations of PD (4-8).",

Parkinsonisme umumnya bersifat idiopatik yang dikenal sebagai Penyakit Parkinson selain itu juga dapat disebabkan karena mekanisme lain seperti akibat proses infeksi, proses imunulogi, dan sindroma paraneoplastik, penggunaan obat tertentu, paparan toksin, proses vaskular, proses trauma, dan lain-lain. Proses ini yang dikenal sebagai parkinsonism sekunder. Beberapa penelitian epidemiologi memang telah membuktikan adanya keterkaitan ini tetapi terdapat beberapa penelitian lain yang justru menolak adanya keterkaitan antara trauma kepala dengan kejadian parkinsonism. Kriteria sebuah trauma kepala berpotensi menimbulkan parkinsonism menurut Crouzon harus memenuhi kriteria antara lain trauma cukup bermakna untuk menyebabkan terjadinya kerusakan pada jaringan otak, waktu proses trauma dengan mulai munculnya gejala parkinson harus jelas, progresivitas gejala neurologis yang nyata, dan derajat keparahan cedera kepala memenuhi kriteria commotio cerebri.

      "title": "Study of Autonomic Nervous System Dysfunction in Parkinson’s Patients.",
      "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease (PD)1 is a chronic neurodegenerative progressive\r\nneurological disease with clinical features viz rigidity, bradykinesia, rest\r\ntremor and postural instability. Assymetry is a prominent feature of this\r\ndisease. PD ranks second among the common neurodegenerative disease\r\nnext only to Alzheimer’s dementia.\r\nThe pathological characteristic of PD is intraneuronal alpha synuclein\r\npositive Lewy bodies and loss of neuronal cell. Apart from classical motor symptoms PD patients also develop non motor symptoms. Non motor\r\nsymptoms cause a major disability in PD and the prominently contribute to decreasing quality of life especially in advanced stages of disease. \r\nThe major non motor symptoms are olfactory loss, psychiatric disturbances of depression and anxiety, sleep disorders, cognitive dysfunction, and \r\nchiefly the Autonomic Dysfunction. Autonomic symptoms in Parkinson’s disease (PD) were first reported in 1817 by James Parkinson himself. \r\nHe described abnormalities of salivation and sweating, and dysfunction of the alimentary tract and urinary bladder. Patients rarely volunteer symptoms \r\nof autonomic disturbance in clinic, and perhaps because of this, there has been little interest in autonomic dysfunction in PD until recent years. \r\nDemonstration of the importance of dysautonomia in Parkinsonism patients, led to a recent resurgence in this area. The introduction of standardised \r\ndiagnostic criteria for PD has improved diagnostic accuracy, and reports since the introduction of these guidelines continue to suggest that between \r\n50% and 80% of subjects have objective evidence of autonomic involvement.\r\nAutonomic nervous system dysfunction in Parkinson’s disease is a common problem and it has to be identified early to initiate proper\r\ntreatment. We conclude the following from our study.\r\n1. The prevalence of ANS dysfunction is significantly high in PD patients of 83.7% . The prevalence is 82.75% in males and 85.2% in\r\nfemales.\r\n2. The prevalence of ANS dysfunction in Males increases as the Hoehn and Yahr stage increases as evidenced by 68.7% of males in\r\nstage I and 100% of males in stage IV and V have ANS dysfunction.\r\n3. The prevalence of ANS dysfunction in Females increases as the Hoehn and Yahr stage increases as evidenced by 80.9% of females\r\nin stage I and 100% of Females in stage IV and V have ANS dysfunction.\r\n4. Sexual dysfunction(84.7%) is the most common ANS dysfunction in males followed by gastrointestinal(56.9%), and thermoregulatory\r\n(51.3%) autonomic disturbances.\r\n5. Urinary disturbances(78.3%), is the most common ANS dysfunction in females followed by thermoregulatory(65.2%),, and\r\ncardiovascular disturbances(56.5%).\r\n6. There is a significant correlation between the age and ANS dysfunction. The severity of dysfunction worsens as the age\r\nadvances, which is statistically significant (p value<0.0001) 7. There is no significant correlation between the sex and severity of\r\nANS dysfunction.\r\n8. As the disease duration advances the severity of dysfunction increases which is statistically significant (p value<0.0001). Patient\r\nwith disease duration less than 5 years had no or only mild ANS dysfunction, whereas with patients with disease duration more than\r\n10 years had predominantly moderate to severe ANS dysfunction in all patients.\r\n9. There exists a significant correlation between Hoehn and Yahr staging and severity of ANS dysfunction. Patient in stage I had no\r\nANS dysfunction(26.4%) or only mild dysfunction(62.3%) whereas patients in stage IV and V have severe ANS dysfunction\r\n(100%).",

En raison de nombreux points communs entre la demence parkinsonienne (DMP), stade tres evolue de la maladie de Parkinson, et la DCL, de nombreux auteurs ont suggere de fusionner ces deux entites. En pratique clinique, il reste utile de distinguer la DMP de la DCL en reservant le terme de DCL aux patients chez lesquels les troubles cognitifs sont apparus precocement au cours de leur maladie. Les criteres diagnostiques de DMP recemment proposes sont plus precis que ceux du DSMIV et devraient permettre un diagnostic plus precoce. La survenue d’hallucinations, d’une diminution d’activite non expliquee par les signes moteurs ou d’une apathie chez un patient doit faire chercher une atteinte des fonctions superieures.

It is known that some non-motor manifestations, such as disturbances in smell, sleep, depression, gastrointestinal dysfunction, and others, may precede motor symptoms. Replenishment of dopamine deficiency, which, as known, develops in PD due to the death of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra, makes it possible to influence most motor and some non-motor symptoms of parkinsonism, however many non-motor manifestations remain resistant to this therapy. In addition, it has only a symptomatic effect, and the pathogenetic treatment of PD is currently unavailable, which is primarily due to insufficient knowledge about the etiology and mechanisms of the development of the disease. In particular, it has already been established that alpha synuclein (a pathomorphological marker of PD) begins to be deposited in the intestinal wall, in the enteric nervous system (ENS) long before it appears in neurons of the substantia nigra. Understanding the mechanism of interaction along the axis “intestine – brain”, the role of intestinal wall dysfunction in the onset and development of PD can lead to the development of new directions in the treatment of this disease. Today, the role of microbiota, in particular the intestinal microbiota, in the functioning of the human body, its various systems, including the nervous system, is widely studied in the world. The influence of its imbalance on the activation of inflammatory reactions in the ENS and the possibility of the subsequent development of PD are considered. This review provides some evidence supporting the hypothesis that PD can be initiated in the gut. In addition, the possibilities of influencing the course of BP using pre-, pro-, syn- and metabiotics are considered.",

However, in our day-to-day clinical practice we tend to see several other symptoms which may be motor or non-motor. Non-motor symptoms (NMS) are quite common and debilitating. The pathological hallmarks of PD are loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNPc) and accumulation of unfolded or misfolded alpha-synuclein. Diagnosis of PD is difficult in the pre-motor stage. Late diagnosis renders a substantial loss of dopaminergic neurons in SNPc and spread of disease in other parts of the brain. This may manifest as either full blown symptoms requiring multiple medications or may even lead to life threatening condition due to lack of early diagnostic tools and techniques. Biomarkers are required to diagnose PD at a very early stage when prevention is possible. Hence, we see a lot of interest among researchers involved in finding a biomarker specific to the disease. Biomarkers may be clinical, image based, genetic, and biochemical. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum markers which may correlate with disease pathophysiology are of great significance. One such molecule which recently gained a lot of attention is neuron-specific enolase (NSE). The main aim of this paper is to highlight the role of NSE in predicting neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation ultimately reflecting damage of brain cells in PD.",

      "abstract": "After Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most prevalent and incidental neurodegenerative disorder, affecting more than 2% of the population older than 65 years old. Since it was first described 200 years ago by Dr James Parkinson, great steps have been made in the understanding of the pathology. However, the cause(s) that initiates and perpetuates the neurodegenerative process is (are) still not clear. Thus, early diagnosis is not available, nor are there efficient therapies that can stop neurodegeneration. PD clinical features are defined by motor (like bradykinesia, resting tremor, gait impairment) and non-motor symptoms (like constipation, apathy, fathigue, olfactory dysfunction, depression and cognitive decline) that get more severe as the disease advances. Neuropathological hallmarks comprise selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in the Substantia Nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and Lewy bodies (LB) in different nuclei of the nervous system. Numerous studies have shown that these pathological features are aggravated by the confluence of other contributing factors, such as a genetic component, exposure to environmental toxins, mitochondrial dysfunction, increase of oxidative stress, calcium imbalance and chronic neuroinflammation, among others. Here, we provide a summary of the actual state of PD's pathology, the most studied molecular mechanisms, classic and novel therapeutic strategies and diagnosis methods, especially highlighting recent advances in these 200 years.",

Although PD is associated with a variety of Non-motor symptoms (NMS) in virtually all patients including hyposmia, constipation, pain and sleep disturbances. It is age related disorder and affects more than 6 million population every year. It is associated with neuronal degeneration in substantia nigra and to lesser extent, in the globus pallidus, putamen and caudate nucleus. The degeneration of the neurons of the substantia nigra that send their axons to the corpus striatum results in reduction in the release of neurotransmitter dopamine with in corpus striatum. This leads to hypersensitivity of the dopamine receptors in the post synaptic neurons in the striatum. Individuals have characteristics signs and symptoms tremors, bradykinesia, postural instabilities, rigidity. Neither loss of sense nor muscle power is usually seen in such cases. Deep tendon, Superficial and Abdominal reflexes are well retained on evaluation. There has been various types of classification in Parkinsonism which are described later. Together with aging, genetics, environment and the role of biological sex as important factor in development of PD has been widely discussed in the past decade. Investigations in PD remains a challenge, recent studies included 7 Tesla MRI, PET and SPECT have proved to be confirmatory in diagnosis of PD. Parkinsonism disease treatment includes increasing the levels of dopamine in brain by giving its immediate precursor L-dopa which can easily cross blood brain barrier unlike dopamine. Evidence of slowing the process of degeneration has been seen with drug selegiline. Other than drugs surgical options include pallidotomy",

Étant généralement peu inquiétantes, le sujet ne les rapportera pas toujours spontanément. Pourtant, elles peuvent en effet signer l’entrée dans une psychose ou une démence parkinsonienne. Elles grèvent la qualité de vie du patient, de son entourage et parfois mettent en péril le maintien à domicile des sujets. Elles ne doivent donc pas êtres négligées. Classiquement les hallucinations dans la maladie de Parkinson sont d’abord visuelles, parfois mineures (simples de passage à la périphérie du champ visuel) ou au contraire très élaborées. Leur physiopathologie demeure imparfaitement connue. L’atteinte visuelle centrale, et notamment au niveau de l’intégration des données visuelles semble jour un rôle majeur. Cependant, d’autres systèmes dont le fonctionnement est perturbé dans la maladie de Parkinson sont impliqués dans la survenue des hallucinations : système visuel périphérique (rétine), voies régulatrices du cycle veille sommeil et notamment du sommeil paradoxal et enfin le système frontal et notamment exécutif. La prise en charge des hallucinations dans la maladie de Parkinson est relativement stéréotypée. Il faut tout d’abord dépister pour les éliminer les facteurs favorisants, notamment de type médicamenteux ou métabolique. Si les hallucinations persistent, le traitement antiparkinsonien doit être revu rapidement avec en priorité la diminution ou l’arrêt des anticholinergiques, des agonistes dopaminergiques et de l’amantadine, puis des inhibiteurs de la catéchol-O-méthyltransférase (COMT) et de la monoaminoxydase B (MAO B). Au besoin, les doses de dopamine peuvent être diminuées. Ces adaptations thérapeutiques permettent en général de contrôler les hallucinations, parfois au détriment de l’état moteur. Malgré tout, si les hallucinations persistent, un traitement neuroleptique par petites doses de clozapine peut être indiqué avec en générale une excellente efficacité.",

      "abstract": "The origin of degenerative diseases of the central nervous system lies in genetic and acquired disorders. Analysis of the clinical characteristics of diseases affecting specific neuronal systems may help us to understand their pathogenesis. The stereotyped symptomatology characteristic of most degenerative diseases results from neuronal death in specific pathways: pyramidal tract and motor neurons in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, nigrostriatal dopamine system in Parkinson's disease, posterior and lateral columns of the spinal cord in Friedreich's ataxia, etc. This suggests that these neurons are sensitive to pathological processes that are still unknown. Progression of the disease, whether linear or not, is slow, but it is more rapid than similar effects due to ageing. This indicates either that the environmental cause of degeneration (if it exists) is continuously present or that a vital process has been once and for all disrupted, perhaps at the level of the genome, causing insufficient production of essential proteins, or accumulation of eventually toxic metabolites. Symptoms generally appear during adulthood, i.e. after normal differentiation has taken place, and after a considerable number of neurons have already been damaged. The initiation of neuronal death precedes the appearance of the first symptoms.",

Idiopathic PD is the most common cause of Parkinsonism (primary Parkinsonism) while, certain medication and different groups of neurological disorder may be causes of secondary Parkinsonism. The presence of intraneuronal proteinaceous cytoplasmic inclusions “Lewy Bodies” and the loss of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons are the main neuropathological hallmarks of PD. However, the etiology of the disease is still undefined; several studies assume that oxidative stress, mitochondrial defects, neuroinflammation, apoptosis and excitotoxicity play vital roles in the pathogenesis and progress of the disease. Experimental models of PD can be induced by several neurotoxins such as 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine, 6-hydroxydopamine, rotenone and paraquat which produce neuropathological and neurochemical changes that are identical to those seen in PD. The primary drug for PD treatment is L-dopa; however, drug-induced dyskinesia and motor complications restricted its use as long term treatment. Dopamine agonists are alternative options for initial treatment of PD and have been reported to retard the onset of motor complications. Combination of L-dopa with other medications, such ascatechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitors and monoamine oxidase B inhibitors has the ability to alleviate L-dopa-induced motor complications. Anticholinergic drugs can be used to control the symptoms of PD but their cognitive and autonomic side effects make them unsuitable for the elderly.",

Erroneous diagnoses are not infrequent, even in the most common disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). [1] Some of these errors may be avoided if the cognitive dysfunctions that often accompany these diseases are included in the diagnostic criteria.\n\nIn general, the cognitive disturbances found in movement disorders are in the category of ``subcortical dementia,'' consisting of a frontal lobe-like syndrome, without genuine amnesia or impairment of instrumental functions (aphasia, apraxia, or agnosia). Except for a few illnesses, such as essential tremor and idiopathic dystonia, in which intellectual deterioration is absent, subtle but specific cognitive deficits can frequently be detected in patients with a variety of diseases accompanied by movement disorders. [2] This is explained by the neuronal pathways connecting the basal ganglia to the cortex projecting not only to regions involved in the control of movements (motor, premotor, supplementary motor areas) but also to cortical areas contributing to cognitive functions (prefrontal cortex). In each of these diseases, the loss of different specific populations of neurons in the basal ganglia produces not only a characteristic motor syndrome but also a recognizable pattern of neuropsychological deficits. The use of appropriate neuropsychological tests to detect these deficits can therefore contribute to the diagnosis of such diseases.\n\nThis brief review will not deal with disorders caused by subcortical lesions of nondegenerative origin (tumors, sequelae of trauma or stroke, inflammatory and metabolic disorders, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, etc.) or with easily identified neurodegenerative diseases, i.e., when motor disability is prominent …",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease a chronic degenerative disease of the central nervous system, clinically manifested by a combination of hypokinesia and postural disorders with rigidity and resting tremor, and autonomic disorders and mental functions. The pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease is inhibition of the functions of dopaminergic systems of the central nervous system (stria negroid, tuberoinfundibular, olfactory, retinal, and so on). With a comprehensive defeat of dopaminergetic systems associated with the appearance not only of motor disorders, but also a wide variety of autonomic, endocrine, emotional and cognitive, that is, non-motor symptoms. The frequency and severity of non-motor disorders correlated with the duration of Parkinson's disease and the severity of motor disorders. It is important to note that many non-motorized violations appear already at the preclinical stage of Parkinson's disease, ahead of the manifestation of the classic symptoms of Parkinson's disease hypokinesia, rigidity, tremor and postural disorder. As the disease progresses, some of them become the dominant clinical significance, having a negative impact on the quality of life of patients, leading to their disability and reducing life expectancy. The period before the movement disorder can be quite long, sometimes up to 10 years, and is characterized by the appearance of non-motor symptoms. Typical non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease are impaired sense of smell, sleep disorders, depression, constipation, change in color perception, less pain, restless leg syndrome, apathy, fatigue, anxiety. Already in the early stages of Parkinson's disease can be detected as a violation of neurodynamic bradiphrenia and disorders of attention. For the first stage Parkinson characteristic lesion olfactory bulb, olfactory nucleus anterior, dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve, peripheral ganglia, autonomic nervous system, as well as pre-and post-ganglionic sympathetic and parasympathetic structures intestinal, heart and pelvic plexus that clinically hypoosmia, constipation, the sympathetic innervation of the myocardium as vasodilation, reducing the strength of heart contractions, disorders of the heart rate variability, orthostatic hypotension. In the second stage of the disease in the degenerative process involves the nucleus of the medulla oblongata and pons, including the core of the nuclei raphe, the locus coeruleus and reticular formation. The second stage is manifested clinically disturbed sleep and wakefulness rapid eye movements during sleep, daytime sleepiness, falling asleep as well as a violation of emotional disorders as depression and apathy. Join a moderate or severe cognitive impairment, and autonomic dysfunction. For the third stage is characterized by loss of the substantia nigra, the tonsils, the basal forebrain is shown connecting motor symptoms such as distortion of fine motor skills. At the fourth step involves the degeneration of the hippocampus and temporal mesokortex. The fourth stage of Parkinson's disease is characterized by a loss of 60% of the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra and a decrease in dopamine production by 80%. Symptomatology complemented tremor, rigidity, hypokinesia, different manifestations of autonomic dysfunction. In the fifth stage of the disease have shown an interest associative zones prefrontal, temporal and parietal cortex. Degeneration of the motor and sensory cortical areas is characteristic of the sixth stage of Parkinson's disease, is characterized by increasing cognitive, behavioral and psychotic disorders.

      "title": "Degenerative Central Nervous System (CNS) Disease",
      "abstract": "The hallmark of degenerative disorders of the CNS is the progressive loss of previously acquired abilities. In infants and young children, a deceleration in the rate of development is often the first presentation: the child falls progressively behind other children and only subsequently loses previously acquired milestones. When the declining developmental quotient is not due to an extrinsic agent or event or to secondary involvement of the CNS by a generalized systemic disease, neurodegenerative disease becomes a consideration.The acquisition of new developmental milestones does not exclude the existence of a degenerative disorder. In healthy infants, strides in development occur sporadically, with a child often appearing to have reached a plateau for several weeks. Initially, it may be only the prolongation of one of these plateaus that leads to suspicion of a progressive neurodegenerative diseaseMost degenerative CNS disorders can be divided clinically into three groups: gray-matter diseases, white-matter diseases, and system diseases. The gray-matter diseases, which primarily involve the neurons, occur with or without histologic evidence of storage of abnormal metabolic products. They lead to neuronal death and secondary degeneration of axons. In the white-matter diseases, myelin is disrupted, either by the destruction of normal myelin or by the production of biochemically abnormal myelin. The system diseases are a heterogeneous group of conditions involving progressive degeneration of anatomically defined systems, such as the dorsal columns,pyramidal tracts, or cerebellar nuclei. Typically, both neurons and myelin are destroyed in these disorders.The first clinical task in evaluating a child for any neurodegenerative disorder is to document that he or she has lost previously acquired milestones or has a decelerating developmental quotient. In either instance, the most important diagnostic tool is repeated developmental evaluations.The major clinical features that differentiate gray-matter from white-matter diseases are related directly to the functional roles of the neurons and myelin. Neuronal involvement in gray-matter disease leads to the early onset of dementia, the progressive loss of cognitive abilities, and seizures that frequently are myoclonic. The basal ganglia and cerebellar nuclei are collections of neurons, so extrapyramidal and cerebellar signs, such as ataxia, are common. Ganglion cells of the retina are affected in many of the gray-matter disorders, producing pigmentary degeneration of the retina. Abnormal storage of lipid in retinal ganglion cells (eg, in Tay-Sachs disease) makes the perifoveal area look gray and opaque. The fovea, which contains no ganglion cells,appears red by contrast, producing the clinically detected \"cherry red spot.\"The majority of degenerative diseases of white matter stem from biochemical defects resulting in abnormal myelin that breaks down rapidly. These\"dysmyelinating\" disorders are called leukodystrophies. Clinically, the earliest sign of most white-matter degenerations is spasticity. Dementia and seizures can occur, but usually later in the clinical course. Extrapyramidal signs are rare, but involvement of cerebellar pathways can cause ataxia. Rather than the cherry-red spot of gray-matter disease,optic atrophy is the most characteristic ocular change seen in white-matter disease. Some patients even have cortical blindness from demyelination of the optic pathways in the cerebral hemispheres.Each of the so-called system diseases has its own signs and symptoms,depending on the particular neural pathways involved. One such disease is Rett syndrome (RS), which is characterized by a period of normal development followed by the loss of developmental milestones and the onset of stereotypic hand movements akin to those seen with autism, followed by seizures and dementia. RS affects girls, probably exclusively, and occurs worldwide. Although most cases are sporadic, the disease has long been suspected of having a genetic basis. Recent genetic advances suggest that the gene for RS is located on the distal arm of the X chromosome.Clinical criteria alone can point to a diagnosis of RS. Usually the antenatal and birth histories are normal, but most girls affected with RS pass through four predictable stages:Stage 1 (birth to ∼18 mo):Deceleration of head growth, beginning between 2 and 4 months of age, results in an acquired microcephaly. This insidious failure of brain growth can be missed if head circumference is not meticulously measured and plotted at health supervision visits. Early in the disease, babies show decreased interest in their environment and become markedly hypotonic.Stage 2 (∼1 to 2 y): The loss of both expressive language and gross motor milestones, and the onset of abnormal hand movements, seizures, irritability,and insomnia are typical of progressing RS.Stage 3 (2 to 10 y): Severe mental retardation, seizures, and persistent stereotypic hand wringing movements characterize the childhood phase of RS. Most patients develop ataxic and wide-based gaits, but many affected girls never walk. Tremulousness is a common finding, as are breath-holding spells. Many children who have RS are misdiagnosed as having Angelman syndrome or ataxic cerebral palsy.Stage 4 (older than 10 y): As girls who have RS approach adolescence,they develop progressive scoliosis,muscle wasting, and can become wheelchair-bound. By the early teenage years, they reach a plateau in their neurologic regression, but death usually occurs during late adolescence from infection or cardiac arrhythmia.Many disorders that have different etiologies may resemble neurodegenerative diseases in clinical presentation:hydrocephalus, hypothyroidism, mass and structural lesions of the brain,chromosomal defects, poorly controlled seizures, environmental deprivation,subdural hematomas, and congenital and chronic infections, such as human immunodeficiency virus. Neurodegenerative disorders, unlike these others,are predominantly hereditary. Although the biochemical basis of many neurodegenerative disorders is not fully understood, a precise biochemical diagnosis always should be sought to make possible an accurate discussion of prognosis, to provide counseling, and sometimes to administer specific treatment.Over the past decade, the availability of molecular genetic testing has improved the accuracy of diagnosis in symptomatic patients, prenatally when genetic risk has been identified, and for carrier testing. Many neurodegenerative disorders can be diagnosed by biochemical testing of blood or urine without invasive procedures to obtain tissue for direct examination. Even so, a diagnosis of an altered enzyme disease should be confirmed histologically.In general, treatment is available for only a few of the neurodegenerative diseases. Unfortunately, most remain invariably fatal by late childhood. Dietary therapy, restriction of a substrate or substrate precursor, modification of enzyme activity with cofactor vitamin therapy, and enzyme replacement all have been attempted with only limited success. Hope for more effective treatment comes from developments in molecular genetics that may allow the repair of specific point mutations in the human genome.In 1966, Rett described a syndrome of cerebral atrophy and hyperammonemia that appeared to affect girls exclusively. Experience has shown that elevated ammonia levels are an exception rather than the rule, and no other laboratory or imaging test provides diagnostic confirmation. Once again, we are thrown back on our clinical skills. Girls who have RS develop normally through the first few months of life, until their brains begin to atrophy, leading to acquired microcephaly. They progress to gait apraxia and truncal ataxia, autistic-like behavior, loss of cognitive function, rather typical\"hand-washing\" movements, seizures,and pyramidal tract signs. The dementia is devastating.We usually think of X-linked disorders, which RS appears to be, as primarily affecting boys: factor VIII deficiency,glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, and ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency. Whereas these disorders are recessive, RS may well be inherited dominantly and be lethal to boys because they have only one X chromosome. Hopefully,as Dr Rich remarks, advances in our understanding of the molecular genetics of neurodegenerative disorders like RS will lead to effective treatment.",

      "title": "The role of functional neurosurgery in Parkinson's disease.",
      "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease is the most common parkinsonian syndrome among a group of primary degenerative brain disorders that manifest parkinsonian signs and symptoms. First described by Sir James Parkinson almost 200 years ago [1], it is believed to affect 0.5–1% of the population above the age of 60. The cardinal motor phenomena include rest tremor, increased muscle tone (rigidity), bradykinesia and hypokinesia, as well as abnormal postural reflexes and locomotion. Over the last decade, increased attention was focused on the non-motor manifestations of PD, such as cognitive changes, affective disorders (particularly depression), autonomic dysfunction (e.g., constipation, orthostatic hypotension), sleep problems, and sensory disturbances. In general, PD is still diagnosed clinically, but a definite diagnosis can be established only at autopsy with demonstration of eosinophilic cytoplasmatic inclusion bodies (Lewy bodies) in the substantia nigra. The differential diagnosis of PD is shared mainly with multisystem atrophy and vascular parkinsonism, as well as with a long list of other rare parkinsonian syndromes. On clinical grounds, it is sometimes extremely difficult to make the diagnosis, and 10–20% of patients are misdiagnosed even by movement disorders specialists. Pathologically, PD is a degenerative disease of brainstem nuclei, mainly of the pars compacta in the substantia nigra where the dopaminergic cell bodies are located. As a result, the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway also degenerates progressively causing hypoactive dopaminergic transmission in the basal ganglia. The cause of the rather selective nigral dopaminergic cell loss in PD is unknown. Certainly, loss of dopamine in the caudate and putamen nuclei of the basal ganglia causes perturbations in other neurotransmitter systems within these nuclei and beyond. Extensive neurophysiological and anatomical research over the last 15 years has indicated that the basal ganglia are only one component of large complex circuits that also involve parts of the cortex and thalamus [2].

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease has been described by James Parkinson and is called shaking palsy. Parkinson's disease is a brain disorder with features of a disease that destroys specific neurons responsible for the release of dopamine, an important substance in the brain. It is a progressive and disabling disease in which there is a loss of pigmented neurons in the substantia nigra with decreased dopamine. Acetylcholine has an excitatory effect, whereas dopamine is inhibitory. Both are found richly in the striated body. Parkinsonism, on the other hand, has its symptoms resulting from the imbalance between these two systems. It is a neurodegenerative disease that mainly affects the basal ganglia, specifically the dopaminergic system. Although clinically characterized by the motor symptoms of resting tremor, bradykinesia and asymmetric stiffness, Parkinson's disease today also includes non-motor symptoms caused by dysfunction of multiple neuronal populations. It is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, after Alzheimer's dementia, affecting 1-2% of the population over 60/65 years in different countries. Although no risk factors are clearly identified except for age, the etiology of the disease remains unknown. With the use of bodybuilding activity after 12 months, a significant improvement in gait of the individual in question was observed. Gait that has compromised the sinister side and generates a “circumference” to achieve foot elevation at the beginning of the gait, lost this circumference and generated significant knee extension, which contributed to the improvement of gait. Therefore, it is concluded that lower limb weight training exercises contribute to the improvement of gait in individuals with Parkinson's disease.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a multisystem alpha-synucleinopathic neurodegenerative disease and the most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer’s disease with a high incidence rate in the elderly population. PD is highly multifactorial in etiology and has complex and wide-ranging pathogenic mechanisms. Environmental exposures and genetic predisposition are prominent risk factors. However, current evidence suggests that an intimate link may exist between the risk factor of sleep disturbance and PD pathogenesis. PD is characterized by the pathological hallmarks of alpha-synuclein aggregations and dopaminergic neuron degeneration in the substantia nigra. The loss of dopamine-producing neurons results in both motor and non-motor symptoms, most commonly, bradykinesia, tremor, rigidity, psychiatric disorders, sleep disorders and gastrointestinal problems. Factors that may exacerbate alpha-synuclein accumulation and dopamine neuron loss include neuroinflammation and glymphatic system impairment. Extracellular alpha-synuclein can induce an inflammatory response which can lead to neural cell death and inhibition of neurogenesis. The glymphatic system functions most optimally to remove extracellular brain solutes during sleep and therefore sleep disruption may be a crucial progression factor as well as a risk factor. This literature review interprets and analyses data from experimental and epidemiological studies to determine the recent advances in establishing a relationship between glymphatic system dysfunction, sleep disturbance, and PD pathogenesis and progression. This review addresses current limitations surrounding the ability to affirm a causal link between improved glymphatic clearance by increased sleep quality in PD prevention and management. Furthermore, this review proposes potential therapeutic approaches that could utilize the protective mechanism of sleep, to promote glymphatic clearance that therefore may reduce disease progression as well as symptom severity in PD patients.",

The analysis of literature on the relationship between RLS and PD revealed three main hypotheses explaining the relatively high incidence of RLS in PD: (1) RLS can be considered as an early (prodromal) manifestation or a predictor of PD that can outpace its main symptoms by several years (by analogy with conduct disorder during sleep with REM); (2) the high incidence of RLS in the advanced stage of PD may be associated with augmentation of previously latent RLS symptoms during prolonged dopaminergic therapy of PD; (3) a significant proportion of RLS cases in PD patients are not «classical» RLS, but represent, for example, manifestations of motor or non-motor fluctuations or a special form of stereotypy in the legs. Further research is needed to determine if any of these statements are true.Нарушения сна и бодрствования являются важными симптомами болезни Паркинсона (БП), которые отрицательно влияют на качество жизни пациентов. Проведенные в обзоре данные свидетельствуют о существовании трех основных гипотез, касающихся взаимоотношения СБН и БП. Согласно первой из них СБН можно рассматривать как раннее (продромальное) проявление или предиктор БП, способный опережать ее основные симптомы на несколько лет (по аналогии с расстройством поведения во сне с БДГ); в соответствии со второй гипотезой, высокая частота СБН на развернутой стадии БП может быть связана с аугментацией ранее латентных симптомов СБН на фоне длительной дофаминергической терапии БП; третья гипотеза допускает, что значительная часть случаев СБН у пациентов с БП не является «классическим» СБН, а представляет собой, например, проявления моторных или немоторных флуктуаций либо особой формы стереотипии в ногах. Дальнейшие исследования необходимы, чтобы определить, является ли хотя бы одно из этих утверждений верным.",

      "title": "Ophthalmic disorders as a manifestation of Parkinson's disease",
      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a severe neurodegenerative disease accompanied with the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the central and peripheral nervous system. The diagnosis of Parkinson's disease can still be made only on the stage of irreversible and nearly total degeneration of the nigrostriatum dopaminergic system and exhaustion of brain compensatory mechanisms that explains the low efficacy of therapy. Ophthalmic pathology is one of the nonmotor symptoms of Parkinson's disease. This can be explained firstly by the fact that eye is a 'peripheral part of brain' and secondly by the involvement of dopaminergic neurons (dopamine-producing cells) that are subject to the selective degeneration during Parkinson's disease in the regulation of visual function in the eye and brain. Dopaminergic neurons and dopamine receptors are present in all structures of the eye. Parkinson's disease cause abnormalities not only in the retina but in the whole optic tract and can be considered as peripheral manifestations of the disease that precede the well-known motor dysfunctions. This review describes ophthalmological symptoms of Parkinson's disease, possible pathophysiological mechanisms of their development, optical disorders in experimental models of Parkinson's disease and also the perspectives of experimental and clinical studies of visual disorders for the development of preclinical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease.Болезнь Паркинсона - тяжелое социально значимое нейродегенеративное заболевание, сопровождающееся дегенерацией дофаминергических нейронов как в центральной нервной системе, так и периферической. До сих пор диагноз болезни Паркинсона может быть поставлен только после необратимой и почти полной деградации нигростриатной дофаминергической системы и истощения компенсаторных механизмов мозга, что и объясняет крайне низкую эффективность лечения больных. Одним из немоторных проявлений болезни Паркинсона считается патология зрения. Такая связь может быть обусловлена, с одной стороны, тем, что глаз фактически является 'мозгом, вынесенным на периферию', а с другой - тем, что в регуляции зрения на уровне мозга и самого глаза принимают участие дофаминергические нейроны (дофамин-продуцирующие клетки), которые при болезни Паркинсона подвержены избирательной дегенерации во всех отделах нервной системы. Дофаминергические нейроны и рецепторы к дофамину имеются во всех структурных образованиях глаза. Изменения зрительной функции при болезни Паркинсона возникают при возникновении патологических процессов не только в сетчатке, но и во всем зрительном аппарате, что можно отнести к периферическим проявлениям этой болезни, которые вполне вероятно предшествуют известным двигательным нарушениям. В настоящем обзоре обсуждены клинические проявления болезни Паркинсона у пациентов со стороны зрительного аппарата и возможные патофизиологические механизмы их развития, а также глазные проявления болезни Паркинсона при экспериментальном ее моделировании. Особое внимание уделено оценке перспективы использования экспериментального моделирования и клинических исследований патологии зрения для разработки доклинической диагностики болезни Паркинсона.",

      "title": "Restriktive Valvulopathie im Rahmen einer Behandlung mit Dopaminagonisten",
      "abstract": "Das Parkinson-Syndrom, benannt nach seinem Entdecker, dem Londoner Arzt Dr. James Parkinson, ist klinisch durch die motorischen Kardinalsymptome Rigor, Tremor, Akinese und posturale Instabilitat gekennzeichnet. Den motorischen Symptomen liegt neuropathologisch eine Degeneration der dopaminergen Neurone der Substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) des Mittelhirnes zu Grunde, die zu einem Dopaminmangel im Striatum fuhrt. \nDas idiopathische Parkinson Syndrom (IPS) ist die haufigste Form des Parkinsonsyndroms und gehort zu den haufigsten Erkrankungen des zentralen Nervensystems und ist nach dem Morbus Alzheimer die zweit haufigste neurodegenerative Erkrankung (McDonald et al., 2003). Das Manifestationsalter liegt zwischen 50 und 79 Jahren, mit einem mittleren Alter bei Krankheitsbeginn zwischen 58 und 62 Jahren, wobei Frauen und Manner annahernd gleich haufig betroffen sind (Muller, 2002). \nDie Ursache des IPS ist weitgehend ungeklart. Es konnten verschiedene Risikofaktoren definiert werden. Steigendes Alter ist als groster Risikofaktor fur die Entwicklung des IPS anzusehen. Es ist bekannt, dass mit zunehmendem Patientenalter immer mehr Neurone im ZNS untergehen, somit auch in der SN. Dabei handelt es sich jedoch nicht ausschlieslich um dopaminerge Neurone der SNc. McGeer konnte zeigen, dass mit steigendem Alter die Tyrosinhydroxylase-Aktivitat als limitierender Faktor bei der Umwandlung von Tyrosin zu Dopamin vermindert ist, wodurch Dopamin in geringerer Konzentration zur Verfugung steht (McGeer, 1971).\nTrotz Einfuhrung der Therapie mit L-Dopa und der damit verbundenen steigenden Lebenserwartung der betroffenen Patienten ist die Uberlebenszeit von IPS Patienten gegenuber gleichaltrigen Kontrollpersonen signifikant vermindert (D'Amelio et al., 2006).\n\nIn der Therapie der motorischen Defizite des idiopathischen Parkinsonsyndroms (IPS) finden unterschiedliche Dopaminagonisten (DA) Anwendung im klinischen Alltag. Chemisch differenziert werden zwei Klassen von Dopaminagonisten: zum Einen die Ergotalkaloide, zu denen insbesondere die Substanzen Pergolid, Lisurid, Cabergolin, Bromocriptin und α-Dihydroergocryptin zahlen. Zum Anderen die Non-Ergotalkaloide mit den Wirkstoffgruppen Apomorphin, Pramipexol, Ropinirol, Rotigotin und Piribedil. \nAktuell werden verschiedene DA in der Therapie des IPS eingesetzt. Bislang konnten mindestens 5 Rezeptorsubtypen der Dopaminrezeptoren beschrieben werden (D1-5). Die pharmakologische Einteilung erfolgt auf Grund der Struktur in zwei Hauptfamilien: Typ D1 (D1, D5) und D2 (D2-D4). DA wirken vorwiegend auf D2-Rezeptoren. Die Zusammenhange zwischen Rezeptorsubtyp, DA und klinischem Nutzen werden kontrovers diskutiert, ferner wirken manche DA auch auf andere Rezeptoren.\n\nDie genannten DA wirken als hochpotente Agonisten auf den Serotonin-Rezeptorsubtyp 5-HT2B. Dieser Rezeptorsubtyp wird unter anderem in groser Zahl auf Herzklappen exprimiert. Eine Aktivierung induziert die Mitogenese mit konsekutiver Myofibroblastenproliferation, wobei es zu einer Fibrosierung der Herzklappen bei intakt bleibender Klappenstruktur kommen kann (Fitzgerald et al., 2000, Rothman et al., 2000). Zu den Medikamenten, die uber diesen Mechanismus die Herzklappen schadigen konnen, gehoren auch die Migranemittel Ergotamin und Methylergonovin, sowie die Anorektika Fenfluramin und Dexfenfluramin (Fitzgerald et al., 2000). Daruber hinaus sind die fibrotischen Veranderungen identisch mit denen, die bei einem serotonin-produzierenden Karzinoid-Tumor beobachtet werden konnen (Moller et al., 2003).\n\nIn der vorliegenden retrospektiven Studie wurden die transthorakalen Echokardiographien von insgesamt 66 Patienten mit bekanntem IPS nach den Kriterien der „American Society of Echocardiography“ ausgewertet und ausgewahlte klinische Parameter, wie Alter, Krankheitsverlauf, sowie Medikamente erhoben. Alle transthorakalen Echokardiographien wurden mit einem Siemens-Sequoia-Gerat von einem Facharzt fur Kardiologie durchgefuhrt.\n\nDie Haufigkeit der restriktiven Valvulopathie wurde bei 66 Patienten mit einem IPS mittels transthorakaler Echokardiographie untersucht. Die Patienten wurden dabei mit Pergolid (n=23), Cabergolin (n=22), Pramipexol (n=4), Ropinirol (n=6) oder L-Dopa (n=11) behandelt. In der Pergolidgruppe wurde bei funf Patienten (22%), in der Cabergolingruppe bei vier Patienten (18%) eine restriktive Valvulopathie diagnostiziert. Kein Hinweis fur eine restriktive Valvulopathie fand sich bei den 21 Patienten, die entweder mit L-Dopa oder mit einem Non-Ergot-Dopaminagonisten behandelt wurden. Der Unterschied zwischen der Kumulativdosis und der Expositionsdauer der betroffenen und nicht betroffenen Patienten war lediglich hinsichtlich der Expositionsdauer in der Pergolidgruppe statistisch signifikant. Es gab keinen Unterschied hinsichtlich des Alters der betroffenen und nicht betroffenen Patienten. Herzklappeninsuffizienzen waren in der Pergolid- und Cabergolingruppe haufiger nachweisbar. Die Mitralklappe war in der Ergot-Gruppe haufiger betroffen als in der Non-Ergot- und L-Dopa-Gruppe. Eine Herzklappeninsuffizienz zweiten oder dritten Grades trat in der Non-Ergot-Gruppe haufiger als in der L-Dopa-Gruppe auf. Die Beobachtung, dass restriktive Valvulopathien lediglich bei den Ergot-Dopaminagonisten Pergolid und Cabergolin in Erscheinung traten, konnte durch die Tatsache zu erklaren sein, dass beide Substanzen hochpotente Agonisten des Serotonin-Rezeptorsubtyp 5-HT2B sind. 5-HT2B-Rezeptoren werden insbesondere auf Herzklappen exprimiert, wobei deren Aktivierung eine Mitogenese mit konsekutiver Myofibroblastenproliferation bewirkt, was pathophysiologisch eine Fibrosierung der Herzklappen bewirken kann.\n\n\nDiese Ergebnisse weisen im Einklang mit bisher publizierten Studien auf ein erhohtes Risiko einer restriktiven Valvulopathie bei Patienten mit einem idiopathischen Parkinsonsyndrom hin, die mit Cabergolin oder Pergolid behandelt wurden.",

      "abstract": "Penyakit Parkinson (PD) merupakan penyakit yang mengganggu pergerakan dan merupakan penyakit degeneratif sistem saraf pusat yang paling umum setelah Alzheimer. Parkinson biasanya terjadi pada usia 65 hingga 70 tahun. Kasus sebelum usia 40 tahun terjadi kurang dari 5%. Patologi pada PD ditandai oleh hilangnya intervasi neuron dopaminergik di subsantia nigra. Neurodegerasi PD tidak terbatas hanya pada neuron dopaminergik di substantia nigra, namun juga melibatkan sel-sel yang berlokasi di area otak lain yang saling terkoneksi. Gangguan motorik terjadi pada PD. Namun, seiring dengan perkembangan penyakit, dapat terjadi gangguan non-motorik seperti penurunan indra penciuman, disfungsi otonom, nyeri, kelelahan, gangguan tidur, gangguan kognitif dan psikiatrik. Penurunan kognitif, dalam bentuk penurunan fungsi eksekutif, visuospasial dan memori, serta demensia, merupakan aspek gangguan non-motorik dari penyakit parkinson. Hal tersebut berefek secara signifikan terhadap kualitas hidup penderita PD. Pemahaman terkait patologi yang mendasari penurunan kognitif pada PD memungkinkan dilakukannya intervensi dini dalam pencegahan perkembangan PD yang mengarah pada gangguan non-motorik. Neuropatologis utama PD adalah keberadaan Lewy bodies yang mengandung α-synuclein dan hilangnya neuron dopaminergik di substantia nigra, yang bermanifestasi penurunan fasilitasi gerakan sadar. Sejalan dengan perkembangan PD, patologi Lewy bodies menyebar ke daerah neokortikal dan kortikal. Neurodegenerasi daerah kortikal dan limbik yang luas, deposisi Lewy bodies, neuroinflamasi, small vascular disease (SVD), dan faktor genetik terlibat dalam penurunan fungsi kognitif pada PD.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common movement disorder and the second most common neurodegenerative disorder. Patients often present with heterogeneous symptoms, reflecting the underlying complex nature of pathogenesis (1). Prevalent motor-related symptoms include bradykinesia, rigidity, resting tremor, and postural instability due in large part to the loss of pigmented, dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc). However, additional brain regions that influence cognitive decline and other psychiatric conditions are affected both prior and subsequent to neurodegeneration in the midbrain, an important factor when considering pathogenic mechanisms in PD (2). In sporadic disease, lesions first occur in the dorsal motor nucleus of the glossopharyngeal and vagal nerves and anterior olfactory nucleus. Gradually, nuclear grays and cortical areas become affected as the disease process in the brain stem follows an ascending course. Lesions then appear in the anteromedial temporal mesocortex and neocortex, with end-stage dysfunction in first-order sensory association/premotor areas and primary sensory and motor fields (3).",

      "title": "Parkinson's syndrome and Parkinson's disease in mitochondrial disorders",
      "abstract": "Abstract In the majority of cases, mitochondrial disorders are multisystem conditions that most frequently affect the skeletal muscle, followed by the central nervous system. One of the clinical manifestations of central nervous system involvement is Parkinson's syndrome (PS). Evidence for an association of mitochondrial defects with PS comes from mitochondrial disorder patients who have developed Parkinson's syndrome and from Parkinson's syndrome patients who have developed a mitochondrial disorder. In addition, there are a number of patients with Parkinson's syndrome or Parkinson's disease (PD) who later develop subclinical immunohistological or biochemical indications of mitochondrial defects or accumulates mitochondrial DNA mutations within various cerebral regions. There are also Parkinson's syndrome patients who present with elevated cerebrospinal‐fluid lactate by magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Furthermore, it has been shown that mutations in genes causing PD, such as PINK1, parkin, DJ1, alpha‐synuclein , and LRRK2 , also cause mitochondrial dysfunction, which is one of the reasons why they are called mitochondrial nigropathies. Parkinson's syndrome in patients with a mitochondrial disorder may also result from oxidative stress or exogenous toxins. Treatment of mitochondrial Parkinson's syndrome is not at variance with the treatment of Parkinson's syndrome due to other causes, but because of the multisystem nature of mitochondrial disorders, mitochondrial Parkinson's syndrome requires additional therapeutic support. © 2011 Movement Disorder Society",

Gejala non motorik PP diantaranya adalah gangguan neuropsikiatri seperti depresi, psikosis, ansietas. Kami melaporkan sebuah kasus PP dengan gejala psikotik berupa halusinasi yang jarang dijumpai. Laporan Kasus: Pasien perempuan berusia 74 tahun terdiagnosis Parkinson sejak lebih dari 20 tahun, dibawa ke rumah sakit dengan bicara tidak nyambung, adanya halusinasi visual, dan emosi yang tidak stabil sejak 1 bulan. Keluarga pasien juga merasa sejak 6 bulan terakhir pasien menjadi sering lupa. Pasien dengan riwayat PP tidak rutin mengkonsumsi obat parkinson di bawah supervisi dokter. Keluhan halusinasi pernah dirasakan 2 tahun lalu namun membaik setelah perawatan. Diskusi: Gejala non motorik dapat dijumpai seiring perkembangan penyakit Parkinson dandapat diidentifikasi sebelum sindrom motor muncul. Adanya gejala psikosis berupa halusinasi dalam kasus yang dipaparkan terhadi setelah 18 tahun sejak pasien terdiagnosis, dimana berdasarkan hasil studi terdahulu dilaporkan 60% penderita PP berkembang adanya halusinasi atau delusi setelah 12 tahun perawatan dan pada usia lebih tua saat onset PP. Gangguan kognitif pada PP juga dicurigai dalam kasus walau belum sepenuhnya dapat ditegakan serta adanya gangguan tidur pada PP dengan prevalensi 40-90% dijumpai pada kasus yang kami laporkan. Kesimpulan: Manifestasi non motorik PP yang mencakup gejala neuropsikiatri sangat mempengaruhi kualitas hidup pasien maupun keluarga dan perawat pasien. Klinisi harus meningkatkan kewaspadaan terhadap gejala non motorik PP dan pemberian tatalaksana farmakologi dan non farmakologi harus dilakukan secara terintegratif bersama dengan bidang-bidang terkait sesuai dengan kondisi pasien.

Specific data on the therapeutical aspects of secondary depressive disorders remains quite scarce. The efficacy of antidepressant drugs may be less important in geriatric depression with cerebral disorders or \"secondary depressions\" than in primary ones. Consequently, electroconvulsive-therapy may appear as an interesting therapeutical option for these patients.",

      "abstract": "Introduction 1.1 Cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease Idiopathic Parkinson`s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by basal ganglia dysfunction frequently being associated with frontostriatal dysfunction and cognitive impairment.The prevalence of PD increases with age and is estimated at 100-200/100000 people (Chen et al., 2001;Schrag et al., 2000) worldwide.The clinical hallmarks of PD are akinesia, rigidity and tremor (Douglas et al., 1999;Hughes et al., 1992).In the past PD has been considered as a pure movement disorder, but in recent years the presence of non-motor symptoms in PD has been recognized.Non-motor symptoms include a variety of autonomic dysfunctions such as orthostatic hypotension, postural tachycardia, bladder dysfunction, sleep disturbances, psychiatric symptoms, i.e. depression, hallucinations or psychosis and cognitive impairment.Non-motor symptoms such as pain, depression or sleep disturbances might precede the onset of motor symptoms in PD and are sometimes even more disabling than motor deficits.For many years cognitive impairment and the occurrence of dementia have been considered as not typical for IPD.James Parkinson (Parkinson, 1817) wrote in his essay on the shaking palsy \" the senses are not disturbed\".However, there is now enough evidence in the literature that dementia might occur in up to 40% of PD-patients (Emre et al., 2004).PD dementia is the third most common reason for dementia.Dementia in PD has been associated with reduced quality of life, greater sensitivity to medication, higher risk of developing psychosis, shortened survival (Levy, 2002), increased caregivers stress and frequent transfer to nursing homes (Aarsland et al., 2000) compared to PD-patients without dementia.In contrast to dementia mild cognitive impairment might occur early in the course of the disease.Approximately, a quarter of PDpatients without dementia have mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) and 20% might have MCI at the time of diagnosis (Aarsland et al., 2011).The cognitive deficits in PD are specific and include executive dysfunction, attentional and visuospatial deficits.Executive functions include control, manipulation, and cognitive flexibility (",

      "abstract": "1.1 Clinical and pathological aspects of Parkinson’s disease Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, affecting millions of people worldwide (Dorsey, Constantinescu et al. 2007). While some cases of familial PD have been reported, the etiology of most cases is still unknown. Significant progress in understanding the pathophysiology of PD has been made from genetic and epidemiologic studies that have implicated defects in a few key biological processes as potential final common pathological pathways. PD is a progressive motor disorder characterized by death of dopaminergic neurons in the region of the brain called the substantia nigra pars compacta although other areas of the central and peripheral nervous system are involved (Braak, Del Tredici et al. 2003). The loss of dopaminergic neurons in PD leads to motor symptoms that include akinesia (inability to initiate movement), bradykinesia (slowness of movement), resting tremor, and balance problems. Non-motor symptoms can include cognitive impairments, mood disturbances, sleep dysfunction, gastrointestinal problems, and dysautonomia. PD is a progressive disorder and despite several effective therapies that treat many of the symptoms, there are no treatments that alter disease progression. Uncovering the causes of PD is likely necessary to find effective disease modifying therapies. The pathological hallmark of PD is the presence of Lewy bodies, which are cytosolic inclusions with several molecular components although -synuclein (-syn) is the predominant protein (Spillantini, Schmidt et al. 1997). Lewy bodies also contain ubiquitin, a polypeptide that targets proteins to the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) for degradation.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the most common movement disorder, with resting tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia and postural instability being major symptoms (1). Neuropathologically, it is characterised by the presence of abundant filamentous inclusions of α-synuclein in the form of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites in some brain cells, including dopaminergic nerve cells of the substantia nigra (2). PD is increasingly recognised as a multisystem disorder, with cognitive decline being one of its most common non-motor symptoms. Many patients with PD develop dementia more than 10 years after diagnosis (3). PD dementia (PDD) is clinically and neuropathologically similar to dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), which is diagnosed when cognitive impairment precedes parkinsonian motor signs or begins within one year from their onset (4). In PDD, cognitive impairment develops in the setting of well-established PD. Besides PD and DLB, multiple system atrophy (MSA) is the third major synucleinopathy (5). It is characterised by the presence of abundant filamentous α-synuclein inclusions in brain cells, especially oligodendrocytes (Papp-Lantos bodies). We previously reported the electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of two types of α-synuclein filaments extracted from the brains of individuals with MSA (6). Each filament type is made of two different protofilaments. Here we report that the cryo-EM structures of α-synuclein filaments from the brains of individuals with PD, PDD and DLB are made of a single protofilament (Lewy fold) that is markedly different from the protofilaments of MSA. These findings establish the existence of distinct molecular conformers of assembled α-synuclein in neurodegenerative disease.",

While clinical reports describe parkinsonism - often with lesions in the substantia nigra - secondary to traumatic brain injury, these do not represent cases of idiopathic PD. In laboratory studies, animal models of traumatic brain injury demonstrate neuronal loss in the substantia nigra, altered dopaminergic metabolism, or altered synuclein pathology. While parkinsonism does occur secondary to TBI, the relationship between TBI and subsequent idiopathic PD remains controversial.",

Esta revisión describe las características clínicas de la EP con énfasis en aquellas que diferencian la enfermedad de otros trastornos parkinsonianos. Debido a que no existe una prueba definitiva para el diagnóstico de la EP, la enfermedad debe diagnosticarse con base en criterios clínicos. El temblor en reposo, la bradicinesia, la rigidez y la pérdida de los reflejos posturales se consideran generalmente los signos cardinales de la EP. La presencia y la presentación específica de estas características se utilizan para diferenciar la EP de los trastornos parkinsonianos relacionados. Otras características clínicas incluyen síntomas motores secundarios (por ejemplo: Hipomimia, disartria, disfagia, sialorrea, micrografía, marcha arrastrando los pies, festinación, congelación, distonía, reflejos glabelares), síntomas no motores (por ejemplo: Disfunción autonómica, anomalías cognitivas / neuroconductuales, trastornos del sueño y anomalías sensoriales como anosmia, parestesias y dolor). La ausencia de temblor en reposo, la aparición temprana de dificultad para caminar, la inestabilidad postural, la demencia, las alucinaciones y la presencia de disautonomía, oftalmoparesia, ataxia y otras características atípicas, junto con una respuesta deficiente o nula a la levodopa, sugieren diagnósticos distintos de la EP. Un conocimiento profundo del amplio espectro de manifestaciones clínicas de la EP es fundamental para el diagnóstico adecuado de la enfermedad. Las mutaciones o variantes genéticas, las anomalías en la neuroimagen y otras pruebas son biomarcadores potenciales que pueden mejorar el diagnóstico y permitir la identificación de personas en riesgo.",

Several of these non-motor symptoms can manifest prior to the onset of motor symptoms. Recognizing these pre-motor symptoms may enable early diagnosis of PD. Currently, no single pre-motor symptom is able to predict the development of PD with 100% sensitivity or specificity. Ongoing studies in several independent at-risk cohorts should reveal the potential of combinations of pre-motor symptoms and multi-stage screening strategies to identify individuals at increased risk of PD. PD progression may be governed by a prion-like spread of a-syn throughout the nervous system. Identifying individuals at the earliest stage will likely be critical to preventing the pathological progression of PD, highlighting the relevance of pre-motor symptoms in the future treatment of the disease.",

If there is extensive brain damage, whether this results from trauma, disease, or brain tumors, there is likely to be a poor response to whatever treatment is given. The more diffuse the lesions the worse this will be: and localisation is also a factor, for example mesial temporal sclerosis causing complex partial seizures. For these reasons patients who are mentally handicapped often have the additional handicap of epilepsy (2). The best chance of controlling the fits lies in making an accurate diagnosis and applying appropriate treatment, whether this is surgery to remove a tumor or the identification of a metabolic disorder which can be controlled, such as pyridoxine dependency or biotinidase deficiency (3). It is important to identify epileptic syndromes, often genetically determined, so that at least an accurate prognosis can be given, even if this does not effect treatment. For example the prognosis for infantile spasms and the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome are well known (4). Tuberous sclerosis is another diagnosis to be viewed with concern. Even within the field of epilepsy there are important diagnostic issues; for instance differentiating minor seizures from reflex anoxic seizures, and absence epilepsy and pseudoseizures from complex partial seizures (5).

      "abstract": "The clinical spectrum of Parkinson's disease (PD) psychosis ranges from mild illusions to formed hallucinations or even frank delusions. Hallucinations occur in about one-third of PD patients treated with chronic dopaminergic therapy and are most often visual. Delusions are less common but typically consist of well-systematized, thematic ideas such as paranoia or infidelity. PD psychosis may be due to extrinsic (i.e., pharmacological treatment) and/or intrinsic (i.e., disease-related) factors. Risk factors for the development of psychosis include older age; advanced disease; akinetic-rigid motor phenotype; concomitant cognitive impairment, depression, or sleep disturbances; and multiple medical problems. When psychosis in PD develops acutely, becomes troublesome or frightening, or poses a safety risk, medical attention is necessary. Medical management of acute psychosis typically includes the following: identifying and addressing specific causes (e.g., infection, medications), reducing or discontinuing medications for PD and other conditions that may aggravate psychosis, and introducing antipsychotic medications. Since antipsychotics with dopamine-blocking properties may worsen parkinsonism, medications with greater serotonergic properties such as clozapine and quetiapine are favored. Effective and well-studied treatments that improve PD ­psychosis without worsening motor function are still needed.",

The disease is manageable with symptomatic treatment for several years before gait, postural and other symptoms develop. The term lower body parkinsonism was introduced to refer to parkinsonian syndromes marked chiefly by gait disturbance, with minimal or no upper limb difficulties.1 Lower body parkinsonism is thought to be a disorder of vascular origin that affects non-dopaminergic brain areas responsible for locomotion.2 The same regions are involved (at least in part) in the later stages of idiopathic PD.3 The principal locomotor deficit associated with parkinsonian syndromes is considered to be impaired generation of the postural shifts that mediate changes from one steady state posture or movement to another.\n\nIn the early stages of typical PD, falls are uncommon, although some gait abnormalities manifest early.4 Patients use voluntary control of gait to …",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND Although the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD) dominate the clinical picture, the nonmotor complaints are often more disabling for the Parkinson patient. REVIEW SUMMARY Behavioral, psychiatric, and cognitive changes occur commonly and are frequent causes for concern. Depression affects up to half of Parkinson patients and can worsen their motor function. Drug-induced psychoses can range from benign visual hallucinations to paranoid delusions. Dementia, classically described as subcortical, usually occurs in the elderly PD patient and is often clinically distinct from the cortical dementia of Alzheimer's disease although pathological descriptions overlap. A parkinsonian personality has been noted by psychoanalysts and movement disorder experts characterized as rigid and compulsive yet cautious and apprehensive with a subordinate behavior. Sleep disturbances associated with PD include insomnia, sleep fragmentation, daytime somnolence, vivid dreams, rapid eye movement behavior disorder, and restless legs syndrome. Sensory symptoms, including pain, may occur, as do symptoms of autonomic dysfunction including postural syncope. Problems with bladder and bowel control and sexual dysfunction are common and often distressing to both the patients and their partners. Fatigue, akathisia, seborrheic dermatitis, and scoliosis are conditions intrinsic to or aggravated by PD. Most of these problems are amenable to pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments. CONCLUSION Helping patients with PD cope with these difficulties is just as important as manipulating therapy to provide control of their motor symptoms. (THE NEUROLOGIST 6:18-27, 2000)",

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics LRRK2 Parkinson disease (PD) is characterized by features consistent with idiopathic PD: initial motor features of slowly progressive asymmetric tremor at rest and/or bradykinesia, cogwheel muscle rigidity, postural instability, and gait abnormalities that may include festination and freezing. Certain nonmotor symptoms in LRRK2-PD, especially REM sleep behavior disorder and cognitive decline, may occur at similar or slightly reduced frequency compared to typical idiopathic* PD. Onset is generally after age 50, although early-onset (in the 20s) and late-onset (in the 90s) disease has been described. * Idiopathic PD refers to the presence of signs and symptoms of PD for which the etiology is currently unknown and in which there is no known family history of PD. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of LRRK2-PD relies on clinical findings and the identification of a heterozygous pathogenic variant in LRRK2. Management Treatment of manifestations: Symptomatic treatment of parkinsonism is the same as for idiopathic Parkinson disease: pharmacologic replacement of dopamine, most commonly accomplished with the precursor of dopamine, L-dopa, combined with carbi-dopa. Dopamine agonists may also be used, as well as monoamine oxidase-B (MAO-B) inhibitors, amantadine, and/or anticholinergics. Physical, occupational, and voice therapy may be beneficial. Exercise is often recommended. Treatment of nonmotor manifestations – e.g., depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, urinary issues, orthostatic hypotension – should be addressed based on individual manifestations. Surveillance: Annual evaluation for both motor and nonmotor symptoms. Motor evaluation focuses on gait and falls, slowness of movement and dexterity, tremor, and rigidity. Evaluation for nonmotor signs and symptoms includes assessment of constipation, mood disorder, impulse control disorders, other psychiatric disorders, cognitive changes, sleep disturbance, orthostatic hypotension, and urinary frequency. In addition, at least yearly evaluation for melanoma. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Dopamine-blocking therapies may exacerbate parkinsonism. Genetic counseling LRRK2-PD is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. However, given the reduced penetrance associated with LRRK2-PD, a high percentage of affected individuals report unaffected parents. De novo mutation may occur; its frequency is unknown. Each child of an individual with LRRK2 Parkinson disease has a 50% chance of inheriting the pathogenic variant. However, the risk of developing disease is lower than 50% because of age-related reduced penetrance. Prenatal diagnosis for pregnancies at increased risk is possible if the pathogenic variant in the family is known.",

Impairment of motor skills and cognition compromise the patient’s diet, nutrition and ability to maintain proper oral hygiene. As a result dental caries and edentulism seem to be a direct impending predicament. It is important to understand that people with parkinson’s disease start experiencing symptoms later in the course of the disease because a significant amount of the substantia nigra neurons have already been lost or impaired. Lewy bodies (accumulation of abnormal alphasynuclein) are found in substantia nigra neurons of PD patients. In addition to movement-related (motor) symptoms, Parkinson’s symptoms may be unrelated to movement (non-motor). People with Parkinson’s disease are often more impacted by their non-motor symptoms than motor symptoms such as apathy, depression, constipation, sleep behavior disorders, loss of sense of smell and cognitive impairment. Prosthodontics management of patients with parkinson’s disease require diligent handling.Objectives and Methods: A patient with a history of Parkinsons disease for the past 5 years (under medication) visited Saveetha dental college with the chief complaint of broken prosthesis. High impact resin was chosen to be material of choice for this patient due to its high flexural strength. So the prosthetic phase was modified and a drug delivery denture was fabricated to meet the demands of this patient.

      "title": "Care and management of the patient with advanced dementia",
      "abstract": "References 316Many of the distinctions among the illnesses that cause the syndrome of dementia become blurred or disappear in advanced or late stage dementia for several reasons. First, neuropathological abnormalities become so widespread that almost all brain systems that subserve cognition and function become impaired. A second and related issue is that the widespread involvement of subcortical or 'downstream' structures and systems results in widespread and near total dysfunction of 'upstream' cognitive and motor systems that are not directly involved by neuropathology. Thus, this chapter will approach late stage or advanced dementia as a single or common end point of all the dementias even though some distinctions, for example the frequency of myoclonus and seizures, do persist. Thus, while knowledge of the unique aspects of specific diseases plays a prominent role in the care of people with dementia in the earlier stages of the dementia, this is usually not the case in late-stage dementia (Robinson et al., 2006).",

It is predominantly a motor disorder but has shown to present with psychosis in few cases. Psychotic symptoms result from chronic treatment with few anti- Parkinson’s medications, ranging from depression, delusions to visual hallucinations, eventually progressing to auditory hallucinations in a few cases. Presence of psychotic symptoms with loss of insight is indicative of late stage of Parkinson’s disease and has poor prognosis. Accurate diagnosis of symptoms can be difficult due to significant overlapping clinical presentations which can be an admixture of underlying disease, exacerbation of pre-existing psychiatric illness or iatrogenic. The article below portrays the complex interplay between Parkinson’s disease psychosis, medications and underlying disease process which heralds early identification of the symptoms using diagnostic tools and imaging techniques to improve the health of individuals and the community by “translating” findings into diagnostic tools and medicines. It also highlights the dire need to develop neuroprotective drugs as a mode of primary prevention of psychosis. We cannot underemphasize the need to educate the patient and caregiver to seek medical attention at earliest for prompt identification and application of disease modifying therapies to reduce disability and morbidity associated with it and limit nursing home placements",

      "abstract": "The difficulty in falling asleep, in maintaining sleep, and early awakening is common in primary care medical practice. Health care providers must be knowledgeable about sleep disorders presenting as poor sleep. There should be an organized and systematic approach to sleep problems. It has been estimated that at least 9% of adults have insomnia, although the prevalence may be as high as 22%. By definition, primary insomnia is a complaint of difficulty in initiating or maintaining sleep at night for at least a month, and it is associated with daytime tiredness and functional impairment. Many times, the complaint of poor sleep is associated with another primary sleep disorder like sleep disordered breathing, restless legs syndrome (RLS), and circadian rhythm disorders or with medical conditions like chronic pain, respiratory disorders and neurologic conditions (parkinsonism, Alzheimer's disease, and other neurodegenerative diseases). Psychiatric disorders have a bilateral relationship with insomnia. In major depression disorder (MDD), insomnia manifests months before symptoms of depression in nearly 40–50% of patients. Chronic insomnia, if not treated, can lead to depression. Pharmacologic treatment is effective in adjustment or short-term insomnia. The most effective management of insomnia is a combination of behavioral and pharmacologic therapy. According to the most excepted studies, a combination of behavior and pharmacologic treatment is considered to be most effective. The combination of the cognitive pharmacotherapy is noted to be superior to any other alternative treatments according to a recent randomized control clinical trial. In another trial, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is noted to be superior to pharmacotherapy. The effects of the CBT could last up to 2 years. A thorough investigation into the causes of primary and secondary insomnia is warranted mostly from the patient perspective.",

      "abstract": "Drug-induced psychiatric states occur frequently in PD. In the prelevodopa era, depression and other psychiatric disorders were described in PD, but in untreated patients psychosis was rare. Since the development of levodopa and other pharmacological treatments for PD, however, psychotic symptoms have become much more common (10-50%). In some individuals these problems can be more disabling than the motor features of PD and, as a result, pose a serious threat to the patient's ability to maintain independence. The drug-induced psychoses consist of several distinct psychiatric syndromes that can be divided broadly into those occurring on a background of a clear sensorium and those which are accompanied by confusion and clouding of consciousness. Benign organic hallucinosis is the most common of these syndromes (30%). It usually occurs on a background of a clear sensorium and may not be a particularly troublesome problem if the patient is able to retain insight into the nature of these symptoms. More disabling syndromes usually include delusional thinking that is frequently paranoid, confusion and even frank delirium. Although all these psychotic syndromes can occur in isolation, there is a tendency for mild symptoms to progress to more disabling ones if adequate and timely treatment is not instituted. Abnormal dreaming and sleep disruption often precede these difficulties by weeks to months and may provide an important early clue to their onset. The mechanisms responsible for drug-induced psychotic symptoms in PD are unknown, but dopaminergic (especially mesolimbic) and serotoninergic systems are likely to be involved. The treatment of the drug-induced psychoses in PD should be undertaken in a stepwise manner. A detailed discussion of this approach, including the use of anti-PD medication adjustment, clozapine, and other medications (neuroleptic and nonneuroleptic) and ECT is provided (see Fig. 1). Although drug-induced psychoses are the most important of the drug-induced psychiatric states, mania, anxiety, and hypersexuality may also occur. Depression is also common in PD, but it is unlikely to occur as a side effect of antiparkinsonian medications.",

      "title": "THE PARKINSONISMS",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND-An accurate diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) depends on identification of the cardinal clinical manifestations of the disorder. The parkinsonisms are those conditions that resemble PD clinically but have a different histological basis, prognosis, and response to treatment. This review details the clinical signs and symptoms that can aid the clinician in differentiating these mimicking conditions from true PD. REVIEW SUMMARY-A variety of diagnostic criteria have been proposed to establish a diagnosis of PD. Most require that at least two of the cardinal motoric signs of PD (akinesia, rigidity, and rest tremor) be present. Even when experienced clinicians apply these criteria, comparisons of clinical diagnoses with autopsy data suggests that there is a relatively high rate of diagnostic error resulting in other akinetic rigid syndromes being mistaken for PD. The possibility that a patient may be suffering from a form of parkinsonism other than PD is often suggested by the appearance of clinical signs and symptoms that are distinctly unusual in PD, such as early falling, early or severe autonomic disturbance, early dementia, lack of response to levodopa, absence of rest tremor, profound asymmetry of motoric signs, recent exposure to dopamine blocking drugs, and isolated involvement of gait. The presence of atypical signs and symptoms not only alert the clinician that a patient may not have PD but, in addition, may suggest which of the other specific parkinsonian disorders, such as progressive supranuclear palsy, multiple system atrophy, or corticobasal degeneration, is present. Laboratory aides are not usually useful in distinguishing between PD and other parkinsonian syndromes, but neuroimaging studies may be of some use in making this distinction because several of the parkinsonisms can be associated with relatively specific magnetic resonance imaging or positron emission tomography scan abnormalities, especially late in their course. CONCLUSION-Careful analysis of the mode of onset, sequence of appearance of symptoms, and response to therapeutic intervention combined with identification of atypical neurologic signs and symptoms can remarkably enhance the clinician's ability to distinguish PD from other akinetic rigid syndromes and disorders of gait that mimic it.",

Initially thought to represent a unitary phenomenon, often attributed to psychiatric disease, it is now clear that parasomnias are not a unitary phenomenon but rather are the manifestation of a wide variety of completely different conditions, most of which are diagnosable and treatable. The parasomnias may be conveniently categorized as \"primary sleep parasomnias\" (disorders of the sleep states per se) and \"secondary sleep parasomnias\" (disorders of other organ systems, which manifest themselves during sleep). The primary sleep parasomnias can be classified according to the sleep state of origin: rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, non-REM (NREM) sleep, or miscellaneous (i.e., those not respecting sleep state). The secondary sleep parasomnias can be further classified by the organ system involved. The underlying pathophysiology of many parasomnias is state dissociation-the brain is partially awake and partially asleep. The result of this mixed state of being is that the brain is awake enough to perform very complex and often protracted motor and/or verbal behaviors but asleep enough not to have conscious awareness of, or responsibility for, these behaviors.",

These NMSs can occur at any stage of PD, especially before the onset of motor symptoms, and may affect a patient's quality of life more than motor symptoms. Although PD is most commonly diagnosed in people over 65 years, some patients exhibit symptom onset before the age of 50, which is clinically known as early‐onset Parkinson's disease (EOPD). The high heterogeneity and incidence of EOPD‐associated NMSs can lead to the misdiagnosis of EOPD as other neurodegenerative diseases. In this review, we discuss the research progress related to NMSs in patients with EOPD, focusing on neuropsychiatric disorders, autonomic dysfunction, sleep disorders, and sensory impairment, and outline the association of NMSs with different genotypic alterations, with the aim of providing assistance in the clinical management of patients.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson Disease Jaime Moore (bio) and Jessica Kandl (bio) CARE OF THE PROFESSIONAL VOICE Parkinson disease (PD) is a progressive neurological disorder that affects approximately two million Americans.1 Typically, this disease presents in either sex after the age of 60; however, it can present in individuals as young as 30. It is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder facing the elderly.2 In addition to affecting movement, 70–90% of patients also experience Parkinson-related voice and speech disturbance, and up to 1/3 of these patients identify the voice and speech symptoms as the most debilitating deficits related to the disease.3 Parkinson disease can be challenging in singers and it is imperative that singing teachers and professional voice users recognize the effects of PD on the voice and speech and be familiar with treatment options. WHAT IS PARKINSON DISEASE? Parkinson disease is a neurologic disease caused by death of neurons in the substantia nigra, a dopamine-producing region of the brain.4 Subsequently, there is a decrease in production of dopamine, an important neurotransmitter. The substantia nigra is part of the basal ganglia, a region of the brain crucial in movement; therefore, changes in the neurotransmitters in this region lead to motor impairment, including difficulty walking resting, speech and voice impairment, tremor, rigidity (stiffness), and bradykinesia (slow movements). In addition to motor symptoms, the disease can cause depression, sleep disturbance, voice changes, and possibly cognitive impairments. Voice changes can be the first sign of PD, and recognizing these changes is important in ensuring that the patient receives the necessary care.5 Parkinson disease should be distinguished from the Parkinson Plus Syndromes such as multisystem atrophy.6 This group of syndromes is defined by Parkinson symptoms, but with additional clinic features such as rapid progression, early dementia, vision changes, and frequent falls. Vocal and speech disturbances in PD include hypokinetic dysarthrias marked by monopitch and slowed speech, reduced stress, imprecise consonants, breathiness, and reduced loudness.7 Patients with PD also have abnormal vocal processing and auditory feedback, which leads to the patient perceiving the voice as normal when it is not.8 Singers might note loss of range, decreased loudness, prolonged warm-up, and increased vocal instability. These speech and voice changes can limit patients’ ability to convey emotions as well as decrease speech intelligibility.9 Decreased intelligibility can lead patients with Parkinson disease to limit social interaction, which may result in isolation and decreased quality of life. [End Page 609] EVALUATION Patients diagnosed with Parkinson dysphonia and/or dysarthria require a multidisciplinary team approach including evaluations by a neurologist, otolaryngologist, speech language pathologist, and other professionals. A complete head and neck exam should be conducted, and additional neurologic signs such as resting tremor, “pill rolling” finger movements, and decreased facial expression should be noted.10 As part of the evaluation, the larynx is visualized typically using videostrobolaryngoscopy. Vocal fold bowing and atrophy are seen commonly, and the vocal fold bowing is associated with glottal incompetence and compensatory muscle tension dysphonia.11 Vocal tremor and vocal paresis and paralysis also have been reported in these patients. Objective voice testing can demonstrate increased shimmer and jitter and decreased harmonic-to-noise ratio. In addition to voice complaints, patients often have difficulty swallowing and reduced sense of smell, and these symptoms may require additional evaluation.12 TREATMENT Typically, medical therapy to increase dopamine is the initial treatment for PD.13 This is done through a combination of medications that prevent degradation of dopamine and increase the supply of dopamine. The regimen requires adjustment as the disease progresses. These medications have been shown to improve motor symptoms of the disease like rigidity, bradykinesia, and resting tremor; however, there are mixed data about the vocal impact.14 Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is another treatment option that involves implanting electrodes into specific areas of the brain. These electrodes send electrical impulses that help regulate pathway activity in a more normal pattern. This treatment has been shown to dramatically improve overall motor function of the patient; however, the vocal results are variable, with some studies demonstrate a negative impact on vocal quality.15 As neither option specifically addresses Parkinson dysphonia, additional treatment typically...",

      "abstract": "The neuropathology of Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD), like Parkinson's disease (PD), is heterogeneous, but most cases have Lewy-related pathology as the major pathologic substrate of parkinsonism. Less common causes of the PDD clinical syndrome include progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration. Most cases of PDD have diffuse cortical Lewy bodies, medial temporal neurofibrillary degeneration, and neocortical diffuse amyloid deposits. In most cases, Alzheimer-type pathology is not sufficient to warrant a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD). A subset of cases have concurrent AD, multiple cerebrovascular lesions consistent with vascular dementia, or severe pathology of the isodendritic core of cortically projecting subcortical nuclei with Lewy-related pathology that is relatively restricted to brainstem or limbic areas. Comparable degrees of Lewy-related and Alzheimer-type pathology are sometimes detected in subjects with PD without dementia, which suggests that there are other, yet to be determined, factors that are more proximal causes of cognitive impairment in PDD, such as synaptic loss, deficiencies of neurotransmitters, or the presence of soluble toxic oligomers of Aβ, tau or α-synuclein that lead to neuronal dysfunction.",

      "abstract": "Abstract When encountering medical symptoms such as motor paralysis, clinicians typically have to distin guish between (at least) two types of potential diagnosis. The first, more traditionally biomedical is that the paralysis originates from some demonstrable pathology of the peripheral or central nervous system; the second does not fulfil this criterion and the paralysis can be broadly considered as an ‘unexplained medical symptom’ or, more specifically, as an ‘unexplained neurological symptom’ (Brown and Ron 2002). Inclusion within this second group, however, could occur for a number of different reasons-none of which is mutually exclusive. It may be that an underlying pathological agent does in fact exist but has yet to be identified. In this case, it may just be a matter of time, test sensitivity and technical breakthrough before a proven physiological abnormality and a relevant causal link will be established. On the other hand, no underlying structural pathology may be",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder, after Alzheimer's disease. It predominantly affects the elderly. Age is the most clearly established risk factor and there is a male:female ratio of 1.5:1. Current incidence in the general population is 8.4-19 per 100,000 population per year with an approximate prevalence of 120 per 100,000 population. NICE recommends that patients with suspected Parkinson's disease should be referred untreated to a specialist with expertise in parkinsonian disorders. The diagnosis is primarily clinical. Parkinson's disease should be suspected in all patients presenting with bradykinesia (which is essential for the diagnosis of any form of parkinsonism, including Parkinson's disease), muscular rigidity, resting tremor (4-6 Hz) and postural instability not caused by a primary visual, vestibular, cerebellar, or proprioceptive dysfunction. At present, there are no specific biochemical, imaging or genetic tests to assist in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. Structural brain imaging (MRI or CT) has no role in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease but may be useful to exclude cerebrovascular disease, hydrocephalus and Wilson's disease in selected cases. Parkinson's disease is a condition that results in both motor and non-motor symptoms. Morbidity associated with non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease is becoming increasingly recognised and some non-motor symptoms such as hyposmia, apathy, depression and REM sleep behaviour disorder may precede the onset of motor symptoms.",

In these cases, the initial symptoms became manifest either during or immediately subsequent to some severe emotional disturbance or psychic trauma and the objective neurologic signs were at first minimal. As a result, the symptoms were attributed to emotional causes and only later after the objective neurologic signs had progressed was the correct diagnosis established. The possible role of the emotional disturbances as an etiological factor in the production of the structural changes is discussed. It is suggested that the emotional trauma precipitates both physiologic and psychologic alterations which lead to the appearance of objective neurologic signs.",

Parkinsonism includes Parkinson's disease (PD) and all the varied conditions with clinical features resembling those of PD. To identify patients with parkinsonism correctly it is important to be able to recognize the cardinal clinical features of PD, namely akinesia, lead-pipe rigidity, rest tremor, and postural instability. The next critically important step is to determine whether they suggest PD or one of the other non-PD causes of parkinsonism (see Table 2.1). This latter distinction will enable effective treatment strategies to be devised and a meaningful discussion of prognosis and genetic implications to be undertaken. The entire process of identifying parkinsonism and assigning a specific clinical diagnosis is particularly challenging in the elderly because many of the motor changes associated with normal ageing resemble parkinsonism. Additionally, several medical conditions that are common in this age group can result in parkinsonism that may incorrectly be considered evidence of PD.",

      "abstract": "Although still considered a paradigmatic movement disorder, Parkinson’s disease (PD) is associated with a broad spectrum of non‐motor symptoms. These include disorders of mood and affect with apathy, anhedonia and depression, cognitive dysfunction and hallucinosis, as well as complex behavioural disorders. Sensory dysfunction with hyposmia or pain is almost universal, as are disturbances of sleep–wake cycle regulation. Autonomic dysfunction including orthostatic hypotension, urogenital dysfunction and constipation is also present to some degree in a majority of patients. Whilst overall non‐motor symptoms become increasingly prevalent with advancing disease, many of them can also antedate the first occurrence of motor signs – most notably depression, hyposmia or rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder (RBD). Although exact clinicopathological correlations for most of these non‐motor features are still poorly understood, the occurrence of constipation, RBD or hyposmia prior to the onset of clinically overt motor dysfunction would appear consistent with the ascending hypothesis of PD pathology proposed by Braak and colleagues. Screening these early non‐motor features might, therefore, be one approach towards early ‘preclinical’ diagnosis of PD. This review article provides an overview of the clinical spectrum of non‐motor symptoms in PD together with a brief review of treatment options.",

Parkinson's disease is a mental illness in which 70% of the existence of Parkinson's disease is compensated, since Parkinsonism is typically treated more well in Ayurveda. In actuality, Parkinson's disease is a term used to describe persons who have Parkinson's disease but don't have any unusual symptoms and have a standard MRI that excludes all possible causes of their Parkinsonian symptoms. The main difference between the two is the medication's effect on Parkinson's disease and not the other. Parkinson's disease, the second most common neurodegenerative illness after Alzheimer's disease, affects around 1 in 1000 persons in the general population and 1% of those over 65 years old.

Moreover, some patients with PD have additional clinical features such as dementia, autonomic dysfunction, or gastrointestinal dysmotility (9–13). As a result, the accurate diagnosis of a patient with parkinsonism, and especially those with atypical or additional clinical features, ultimately depends on neuropathological examination. This chapter will review the pathological changes that characterize those conditions that may present with or have parkinsonism as a major feature, either in isolation or combined with other clinical manifestations.

Dementia in PD is nor responsive to dopamine replacement therapy, and is associated with a high morbidity, poor prognosis, and rapid progression. PD is characterized by degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra associated with accumulation of the synaptic protein α-synuclein, forming the pathological hallmark Lewy bodies (LB). However, advanced stages of PD are associated with other factors which may contribute to dementia, such as neurofibrillary tangles, senile plaques, vascular changes, and normal ageing processes. The literature reviewed in this chapter suggests that LB pathology appears to be the central pathology in PD-D but other factors also contribute.",

Other definitions exist, and there is no clear consensus in this matter. The core elements of insomnia are an inadequate quantity or quality of sleep, with both nocturnal and daytime consequences. Traditionally, insomnia has been subgrouped into sleep-onset insomnia, sleep-maintaining insomnia, and insomnia with early morning awakening; however, there is extensive overlap, and most insomniacs fit into more than one subgroup. Sleep disorders, particularly in the elderly, are strongly associated with increased morbidity and mortality, significant limitations in activities of daily living, and impaired quality of life. Aside from the obvious complications of daytime fatigue and somnolence, insomniacs have an increased incidence of psychiatric disorders such as depression and anxiety, increased use of over-the-counter medications and alcohol, and a higher incidence of accidents and unemployment. Chronic sleep loss has multisystem consequences and may represent a risk factor for obesity, insulin resistance, and Type 2 diabetes. However, the brunt of negative effects of sleep deprivation is borne by the brain. Chronic insomnia independently predicts incident cognitive decline in older men, but it also has been suggested that some degree of apparent age-related cognitive decline may be due to treatable insomnia.",

      "abstract": "The clinical neuropsychologic profiles of patients with Parkinson's disease and patients with SDAT show both overlap and dissociation. Speech, language, and certain memory skills are examples of dissociable differences, especially in the early stages of the disease. Furthermore the presence of depression, evidence of cognitive slowing, and absence of aphasia in patients with Parkinson's disease suggest prominent subcortical involvement. It is probably premature to categorize all of the cognitive changes in patients with Parkinson's disease as subcortical, however. Some skills, such as visuospatial and executive functions, are impaired in both disorders, and although the etiologic bases for task failure may differ for each, this issue remains open-ended. Another problem is that often the evidence for or against the cortical/subcortical distinction is insufficient and in some cases based on a single measure thought to be representative of a given cognitive domain. Most importantly there are few comparative studies that provide unequivocal support for making a cortical/subcortical distinction. Failure to equate for level of cognitive impairment or functional disability between dementias and strict adherence to cross-sectional study designs further compromise efforts to characterize each syndrome precisely. Whitehouse suggested that a prospective study of several different dementias studied in parallel, examining a wide range of cognitive skills, is required before the cortical/subcortical classification scheme can be validated. A critical component is an autopsy program to confirm diagnoses and provide clinicopathologic correlation. It is possible that the diverse nature of the cognitive impairment in patients with Parkinson's disease is not a methodologic artifact but reflects multiple disease subtypes. Ross, Mahler, and Cummings proposed three dementia syndromes in patients with Parkinson's disease: one that is relatively mild and meets the criteria for subcortical dementia, a second that is more severe and shows a wider range of cognitive impairment but is still neuropathologically distinct from SDAT, and a third severe dementia with both subcortical and cortical involvement that may reflect basal ganglia and Alzheimer-type pathology.",

Druga je po ucestalosti, odmah nakon Alzhaimerove bolesti kao prevladavajuci neurodegenerativni poremecaj s prosjecnom dobi nastanka u 60. godini života. Iako je bolest prisutna u oba spola, muskarci imaju 1.5 puta visi rizik od obolijevanja nego žene. Etiologija bolesti jos uvijek nije poznata, ali se pretpostavlja da je Parkinsonova bolest rezultat utjecaja razlicitih kombinacija genetskih i okolisnih cimbenika. Dijagnoza bolesti postavlja se na temelju klinicke slike. Glavni, motoricki znakovi bolesti su tremor u mirovanju, rigor, bradikinezija i posturalna nestabilnost koji uzrokuju poteskoce za osobu koja se sa njima susrece u svakodnevnim aktivnostima. Napredovanje intenziteta simptoma i same bolesti razlicito je kod svake osobe. Bolesnici hodaju sitnim koracima, nagnuti prema naprijed, bez spontanih kretnji ruku tijekom hoda, osiromasene mimike lica, tesko zapocinju određenu kretnju, pojavljuju se neželjena ubrzanja u govoru i kretanju sto dovodi do cestih padova. Iznimno je važno na vrijeme otkriti bolest, kako bi se sto prije zapocelo lijecenje i ucinkovitije smanjili simptomi bolesti. Fizioterapijska intervencija, koja zapocinje kvalitetnom procjenom, mora sadržavati sve komponente koje ce kroz intervenciju donijeti boljitak za pacijenta. Nakon procjene izrađuje se plan fizioterapijske intervencije koja treba biti individualno prilagođena svakom pacijentu. Vježbe disanja, vježbe koordinacije i balansa, vježbe izdržljivosti i vježbe povecanja mobilnosti, te medicinska masaža neke su od oblika fizioterapijske intervencije u lijecenju Parkinsonove bolesti. Osim standardnog terapijskog tretmana pacijenti oboljeli od Parkinsonove bolesti služe se i komplementarnim metodama lijecenja od kojih veliku važnost imaju akupunktura, Bowen tehnika, Shiatsu masaža, Tai Chi, joga, muzikoterapija, terapija plesom i osteopatija.

      "abstract": "Abstract Neurodegenerative diseases are often classified based on the abnormal accumulation of synuclein or tau. Traditionally, these disorders have been viewed as distinct clinical and pathological entities. However, advances in molecular genetics and protein biochemistry have shown intriguing overlaps. The most common synucleinopathy, Parkinson's disease, is characterized by extrapyramidal motor dysfunction, whereas the most common tauopathy, Alzheimer's disease, is defined by dementia. Yet there is overlap of clinical features; Parkinson's disease patients frequently have dementia, and Alzheimer's disease patients often manifest parkinsonism. Dementia with Lewy bodies exemplifies the existence of a continuum among these diseases. This overlap extends to the neuropathological findings; the pathognomonic hallmark for one set of disorders, Lewy bodies or neurofibrillary tangles, is present more often than expected in the other set. Moreover, mutations in LRRK2 known to cause parkinsonism are associated not only with dopaminergic neuronal degeneration, but also with the accumulation of synuclein, tau, neither, or both proteins. Other shared genetic features between tauopathies and synucleinopathies also exist. Finally, the known protein interactions between tau and synuclein further highlight the interface. Evidence for the intersection of tauopathies and synucleinopathies indicates the need for an updated disease classification scheme and may have important implications for therapeutic development.

      "abstract": "Cognitive symptoms such as poor memory and concentration represent a common cause of morbidity among patients presenting to general practitioners and may result in referral for a neurological opinion. In many cases, these symptoms do not relate to an underlying neurological disease or dementia. In this article we present a personal perspective on the differential diagnosis of cognitive symptoms in the neurology clinic, especially as this applies to patients who seek advice about memory problems but have no neurological disease process. These overlapping categories include the following 'functional' categories: 1) cognitive symptoms as part of anxiety or depression; 2) \"normal\" cognitive symptoms that become the focus of attention; 3) isolated functional cognitive disorder in which symptoms are outwith 'normal' but not explained by anxiety; 4) health anxiety about dementia; 5) cognitive symptoms as part of another functional disorder; and 6) retrograde dissociative (psychogenic) amnesia. Other 'non-dementia' diagnoses to consider in addition are 1) cognitive symptoms secondary to prescribed medication or substance misuse; 2) diseases other than dementia causing cognitive disorders; 3) patients who appear to have functional cognitive symptoms but then go on to develop dementia/another neurological disease; and finally 4) exaggeration/malingering. We discuss previous attempts to classify the problem of functional cognitive symptoms, the importance of making a positive diagnosis for the patient, and the need for large cohort studies to better define and manage this large group of patients.",

      "title": "Dysfunction of olfactory structures: A conserved mechanism of neurodegeneration?",
      "abstract": "The olfactory system participates in the reception, integration, and interpretation of olfactory signals. This chemical sense is essential for survival since it is involved in basic behaviors and physiological processes. Olfactory function decreases with age; however, olfactory impairments are also observed in several neurodegenerative and psychiatric pathologies. It is widely described that olfactory dysfunction is an early symptom in Parkinson (PD) and Alzheimer (AD) diseases, furthermore, olfactory brain areas are affected by the pathological hallmarks of these diseases before the brain areas involved in the motor and cognitive impairments, respectively. This information suggests a key role of olfactory system damage in the beginning of a neurodegenerative process. Not only does the early injury of the olfactory system occur in AD and PD, but also in other pathologies since increasing evidence indicate the presence of olfactory impairments in other neurogenerative and psychiatric diseases namely, depression, schizophrenia, and autism among others. In addition, people with systemic chronic diseases that promote central nervous system damage such as type 2 diabetes and obesity also show olfactory dysfunction, which also suggests that olfactory alterations in these individuals could be an early manifestation of a neurodegenerative process. Then, the aim of the manuscript is to describe the information which supports that olfactory system impairment is a prodromal factor for the development of several neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders, to recognize it as a shared mechanism of degeneration among diverse neuropathologies, and discuss the relevance of the assessment of the olfactory function in the diagnosis and improvement of neurodegeneration.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive alterations accompany or follow motor disorders in subjects with Parkinsonism. The canonical phenotype of the Parkinson’s disease Dementia (PD-D) or Lewy Body Dementia (LBD) includes deficit of attention, executive and visuospatial functions, and presents often with apathy, hallucinations, delusions, excessive daytime sleepiness, or sleep disorders. However, the clinical expression may overlap with other neurodegenerative diseases associated with cognitive disorders. Thus, while clinicians rely on phenomenological patterns to infer the disease causing the cognitive impairment, the inference is weakened by the heterogeneous clinical expression of the disease. In addition, recent post-mortem studies seem to undermine the supposed pathology-phenotype coherence, making it more and more unreliable the diagnosis based on symptoms. The lack of coherence between phenotype and pathology may support the speculation about a common mechanism underlying the progression of the disease. While it is very likely that a distinct, specific causal event determines the disease itself, the progression might well follow common patterns. A number of observations suggest that progressive diseases, which cause cognitive impairment, share a prion-like mechanism. A seeding process is supposed to account for the spreading of the lesion.",

The cause of PD is still unknown, but a number of genetic as well as environmental factors contributing to the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease have been identified. The hallmark of PD includes dopamine deficiency (neurotransmitter imbalance) due to the gradual loss of dopaminergic nerves in the sub-stantia nigra in the midbrain. Studying the mutation of associated genes is particularly informative in understanding the fundamental molecular and pathogenic changes in PD. Intracellular accumulation of misfolded or degraded protein due to mutated genes leading to the manifestation of mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress followed by multifaceted patho-physiologic symptoms. Other studies include the appearance of both motor and non-motor responses like resting tremor, muscle stiffness, slow movement and anxiety, anaemia, constipation, rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder. Many bioactive natural compounds have shown positive pharmacological results in treating a number of extensive disease models of PD. Despite the availability of end number of potent medicinal plants around the world, limited research has been done associated with various neurological disorders, in-cluding PD. The currently available dopamine-based drug treatments have several side-effects, fur-ther, not effective enough to combat PD completely. Therefore, various plant-based compounds with medicinal benefits have grabbed lots of attention of researchers to deal with various life-threatening neurodegenerative disorders like PD. On the basis of literature available till date, here, we have dis-cussed and addressed the molecular basis, current scenario, and the best possible treatment of PD for the future with minimal or no side-effects using various key bioactive compounds from natural origin/medicinal plants.",

      "title": "Gut Hormones Restrict Neurodegeneration in Parkinson’s Disease",
      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder and the second most common neurological disorder behind Alzheimer's disease in today's society.It is a progressive disorder that affects more than 1% of people older than 60.Cardinal features of Parkinson's disease include motor dysfunction such as rigidity, resting tremor, postural instability and bradykinesia.These debilitating symptoms manifest due to the massive loss of dopamine in the striatum, the nerve terminal region of dopamine neurons are located in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc).This anatomical circuit is known as the nigrostriatal pathway and plays a critical role in fine tuning motor functions.At present there are only a few known monogenic mutations accelerating the onset of Parkinson's disease, therefore most cases are considered sporadic and develop as a complex polygenic interaction with age and environment.Although the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease is largely unknown, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, intracellular protein accumulation (Lewy Bodies containing α-synuclein) and abnormal protein degradation all play a key role in disease progression.Because loss of dopamine in the striatum causes motor dysfunction in Parkinson's disease, dopamine supplementation can be used to alleviate motor symptoms but this is only a temporary solution as the efficacy diminishes with age and as the disease progresses.There are no known therapies that halt or reduce the progression of the disease, largely because the cause of Parkinson's disease remains enigmatic.Parkinson's disease also causes symptoms in other parts of the nervous system.Constipation and gastrointestinal (GI) problems are often some of the earliest symptoms, well before the presence of dopamine dysfunction, and post mortem studies in Parkinson's disease patients identified protein accumulation in the enteric nervous system of the GI tract [1].This 'Braak's hypothesis' suggests protein accumulation in enteric neurons spreads in a retrograde manner to the brain through the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus and triggers Parkinson's disease.Braak observed in post mortem tissue that patients with presymptomatic Parkinson's disease had protein aggregation in the peripheral nervous system but not the central nervous system [1].Protein aggregation ascended into the central nervous system and correlated with the development of motor dysfunction.This observation shows that the topographic ascending lesion pattern resembles a falling row of www.intechopen.comAdvanced Understanding of Neurodegenerative Diseases 270 dominos and prompts the question; does Parkinson's disease originate outside the central nervous system?Recent evidence supports the hypothesis that GI abnormalities, which precede central nervous system changes, trigger Parkinson's disease.For example, mice expressing mutant α-synuclein in gut enteric neurons exhibited extensive GI dysfunction followed by motor abnormalities [2].Moreover, low doses of rotenone, a compound found in pesticides that causes Parkinson's-like conditions, produced GI disturbances and enteric neuronal αsynuclein aggregates in rats before neuronal protein aggregation [3,4].These studies, taken together with the early GI disturbances in humans, clearly implicate the GI system in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease.The stomach and intestines comprise the GI 'digestive' system, which produces a number of hormones to aid energy metabolism, digestion and nutrient uptake into the circulation.Despite the fact that evidence suggests GI dysfunction triggers Parkinson's disease, little is known about gastrointestinal hormones in Parkinson's disease.This chapter examines how gut hormones influence the nigrostriatal dopamine system.www.intechopen.",

      "abstract": "In the nearly 200 years since James Parkinson's original essay on ‘shaking palsy’ (Parkinson, 1817), clinicians have learned that he described a syndrome rather than a specific disease and that Parkinson's has many imitators. As a syndrome, parkinsonism is characterized by tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity and postural reflex compromise. Parkinson's disease is one of many parkinsonian syndromes and is defined by the same clinical signs in association with a distinct type and pattern of cellular degeneration. Parkinsonism can occur as an isolated clinical syndrome, classified as primary when it is due to hereditary or idiopathic causes or secondary when it has another identifiable underlying etiology. When parkinsonism occurs in association with other neurological signs, it is classified as one of the well-defined parkinsonism-plus syndromes or as parkinsonism associated with defined hereditodegenerative disorders (Table 37.1). Parkinson's disease is the archetype of primary parkinsonism. A thorough history and comprehensive examination can usually differentiate Parkinson's disease from other parkinsonian syndromes. Nevertheless, clinicopathological studies have shown that 20% of patients thought clinically to have Parkinson's disease turn out to have pathological cellular changes suggestive of other diagnoses, and 5–10% of parkinsonian subjects with an atypical clinical picture for Parkinson's disease have the typical cellular changes of Parkinson's disease at autopsy (Hughes et al., 2001).",

Certain congenital cases do not come under this class, and there is also a group in which there seems to be a “negative disposition” of the individual. From a clinical study one of the following factors is necessary to the production of these ideas: (1) a state of mental weakness produced either by an intoxication or by some other cause acting acutely, or (2) a state of acute, subacute, or chronic pathological pain, or (3) an originally degenerative condition.",

Regarding the etiology of PD, it is a complex disease involving both genetic and lifestyle factors as well as environmental factors. In addition to the cardinal motor symptoms, non-motor symptoms and comorbidities of PD are increasingly recognized as central to the disease. These include somatic symptoms, such as pain and autonomic dysfunction (orthostatic hypotension, bladder dysfunction, and constipation), and behavioral problems, such as dementia, impulse control disorders, sleep disorders, fatigue, and psychosis.

      "abstract": "Event Abstract Back to Event Insight in bipolar disorder While the relationship between lack of insight in psychiatric disorders and anosognosia in neurological disorders has not been extensively studied, interest in examining psychiatric lack of insight has roots in advances in the understanding of the anosognosia. It is possible that both conditions share a common etiology in parietal and/or frontal lobe dysfunction, or they may represent two distinct entities with different etiologies, i.e., with predominance of brain dysfunction in anosognosia as opposed to the possible prominence of psychosocial factors in psychiatric lack of insight. While it has long been recognized that insight is impaired in schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders, the topic of insight in bipolar disorder has been relatively neglected. In mania, impairment of insight is about as severe as in schizophrenia and probably is associated with poor prognosis. The neuropsychological and/or psychosocial roots of lack of insight in mania remain unclear even if we recently reported that lack of insight might predict impaired decision-making in manic patients. In bipolar depression, impairment of insight is less severe than in mania; however, psychotic depression is associated with less insight than non-psychotic depression. There is some evidence that insight in depression may be less impaired when depressive symptoms are more severe, possibly supporting the depressive realism hypothesis. In remission, bipolar patients seem to recover insight. Thus, lack of insight in bipolar disorder appears to be a state-related phenomenon, unlike schizophrenia. Interest in studying clinical, neuropsychological and biological roots of insight in bipolar disorder, and their changes across different phases of illness, may improve our understanding of mechanisms underlying awareness of well-being in human.

      "abstract": "Patients with Parkinson's disease who develop disabling levodopa-induced motor fluctuations have a stronger therapeutic response than those who experience a more modest but stable response. A difference in the histopathological lesion between the two groups might be responsible. Case records from 97 patients with pathologically proven Parkinson's disease were reviewed to determine the pattern of levodopa response. Pathological findings for fluctuating and non-fluctuating cases were compared. Patients with motor fluctuations had a younger age of onset and longer disease course (P < 0.001), although mean age at death was almost the same. Four milestones of advanced disease (frequent falls, visual hallucinations, cognitive disability and need for residential care) occurred at a similar time from death in each group; this interval was not proportionate to the disease duration. There were no significant differences in the severity or distribution of Lewy body or other pathologies. Irrespective of the pattern of levodopa response, patients reach a common pathological endpoint at a similar age, and the duration and manifestations of end-stage disease are alike. A non-linear or exponential time relationship may govern the late clinical and pathological progression of Parkinson's disease.",

      "abstract": "It is frequently assumed that idiopathic Parkinson's disease starts with several nonmotor symptoms and signs, but the evidence for this stage in the disease process is of variable quality. This review evaluates the more robust prospective or pathologically confirmed publications to establish whether there is a premotor period and if so what is its duration. The most informative studies are considered to be those concerned with olfaction, dysautonomia, and sleep disorder. Estimates for the duration of the prodromal phase vary from months to decades. It is concluded that there probably is an early phase in the disease where a variety of nonmotor features develop, but the sequence and time of onset of such features is not well established.",

Although routine clinical neurological examination generally does not reveal any abnormality of sensation in persons with PD, objective abnormalities of proprioceptive function and sensorimotor integration have been demonstrated with sophisticated testing. Painful symptoms pose a considerable diagnostic and therapeutic challenge to the clinician. For diagnostic purposes, it is helpful to classify painful or unpleasant sensory symptoms into one or more of the following five categories: musculoskeletal pain, radicular or neuropathic pain, dystonia-related pain, akathitic discomfort, or primary, central parkinsonian pain. The identification of parkinsonian pain is vitally important for the effective diagnosis and treatment of pain in PD.",

      "title": "Parkinson's disease and parkinsonism: Clinicopathological discrepancies on diagnosis in three patients",
      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders. The cardinal neuropathological features of PD include selective and progressive loss of pigmented neurons in the substantia nigra, deficiencies in dopaminergic signaling in the striatum, and occurrence of phosphorylated α-synuclein-identified Lewy bodies in the nervous system. Parkinsonism, the clinical presentation of movement disorders seen in PD, is a feature shared commonly by other pathologically distinct neurodegenerative diseases, such as progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), and multiple system atrophy (MSA). Consequently, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish PD from such parkinsonism-related neurological disorders. In addition, parkinsonism is not always a feature of certain neurodegenerative diseases, and it can sometimes develop as a result of various forms of drug intoxication or cerebrovascular disease. Here, we describe the clinicopathological features of three patients (cases 1, 2, and 3) diagnosed as having PSP, MSA, and PD, respectively, in each of whom the postmortem histopathological diagnosis differed from the final clinical diagnosis. Neuropathologically, they had suffered from coexistent disorders: PD, MSA, and argyrophilic grain disease (case 1); PD (case 2); and vascular parkinsonism (case 3). The variety of patients showing features of parkinsonism underlines the importance of careful long-term follow up followed by postmortem neuropathological evaluation.",

      "abstract": "Comorbidity of depression, or depressive symptoms and Parkinson's disease (PD), is a common condition with a high prevalence,1 which may start developing before the formal clinical diagnosis of PD during the so-called premotor (non-motor or preclinical or prodromal) stage of the disease. Such association may be further strengthened during the progression of continuous neuronal loss and disease. The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of the association between depression and PD are not clearly understood, and it is hypothesised that changes in brain pathology, neurotransmitter signalling pathways and, particularly, abnormalities of dopaminergic, noradrenergic and serotoninergic projections may substantially contribute to its development.1 Psychological factors, life stresses and internal perception of PD as a devastating neurodegenerative condition with no effective cure may also contribute to the development of depression in patients with PD. Commonly observed key PD symptoms, such as rigidity, bradykinesia and hypomimia, may add complexity in clinical differentiation between depression or depressive symptoms and PD.\n\nVriend et al 2 use dopamine transporter (DaT) imaging with Iodine-123-fluoropropyl (FP)-carbomethoxy-3 β-(4-iodophenyltropane) (CIT) [123I]FP-CIT (DaTSCAN or DaTscan) in patients with PD with associated depressive …",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second neurodegenerative disorder most prevalent in the world, characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the Substantia Nigra (SN). It is well known for its motor and non-motor symptoms including bradykinesia, resting tremor, psychiatric, cardiorespiratory, and other dysfunctions. Pathological apoptosis contributes to a wide variety of diseases including PD. Various insults and/or cellular phenotypes have been shown to trigger distinct signaling events leading to cell death in neurons affected by PD. The intrinsic or mitochondrial pathway, inflammatory or oxidative stress-induced extrinsic pathways are the main events associated with apoptosis in PD-related neuronal loss. Although SN is the main brain area studied so far, other brain nuclei are also affected by the disease leading to non-classical motor symptoms as well as non-motor symptoms. Among these, the respiratory symptoms are often overlooked, yet they can cause discomfort and may contribute to patients shortened lifespan after disease diagnosis. While animal and",

Most previous attempts to define the heterogeneity of the condition have used prospective methods based on arbitrary features such as motor symptoms or age of disease onset. However, nonmotor symptoms including neuropsychological, neuropsychiatric, and behavioral impairments have received less attention. Sleep disturbances are extremely common in PD and appear to be associated with cognitive and psychiatric problems. Recent research has begun to elucidate the links between these variables, but the origin and extent of these relationships are not clearly understood. This review outlines the importance of sleep for healthy cognition and mood, highlighting the possible implications that disturbed sleep may have with regard to patients with PD. It also emphasizes the need for further studies that explore the heterogeneity of all disease features in PD.",

The aim of this study was to compare the frequency and the severity of psychiatric disorders in primary focal dystonia and Parkinson's disease. Methods: Two groups of 30 patients matched by gender and age underwent a neurological and psychiatric assessment. Results: Parkinson’s disease patients were diagnosed with higher rates of major depression ( P = 0.02) and generalized anxiety disorder ( P = 0.02), and greater severity of depressive symptoms ( P = 0.04), while patients with primary focal dystonia exhibited increased severity of obsessive-compulsive symptoms ( P = 0.02). Discussion: The difference in pathophysiology of primary focal dystonia and Parkinson’s disease may explain the different psychiatric profiles of these two diseases. The increased frequency of affective symptoms in Parkinson’s disease may be related to the fact that Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disease marked by the loss of monoaminergic neurons which does not happen in primary focal dystonia. Conclusion: The psychiatric profile differs in movement disorders with distinct neurobiological bases.

Although the first sign in Parkinson disease (PD) at an early stage varies, the diagnosis of PD is often the correct one, simply by taking account of its prevalence. However, confirmation of that diagnosis takes time and serial examinations, and it is increasingly recognized that a fraction of those diagnosed with PD actually have another movement disorder and will therefore have a different neurodegenerative disease at autopsy.1 In particular, the atypical parkinsonism disorders (APDs), such as multiple system atrophy (MSA), progressive supranuclear palsy, and corticobasal syndrome, as well as vascular parkinsonism, can mimic PD at early stages of the clinical disease. These misdiagnoses are not isolated to the general neurology practice; in fact, when the presentation is unusual or early enough, even movement disorder specialists cannot discriminate between PD and APD. As a result of these diagnostic challenges, individuals can walk away thinking they have PD, when in reality a typically more aggressive condition looms in their near future.",

      "abstract": "A Doença de Parkinson (DP) é a segunda doença neurodegenerativa mais comum. Na DP a forma degenerativa ou idiopática é a mais encontrada; existe também uma forma secundária com causa conhecida ou suspeita. Clinicamente, a DP manifesta-se com bradicinesia, rigidez, tremor de repouso e instabilidade postural. O início da DP é de caráter assimétrico e insidioso. A evolução dos sintomas é usualmente lenta e o prognóstico clínico é muito variável. O impacto da DP afeta todos os membros da família, pois além dos aspectos financeiros, toda organização familiar, psicológica e social sofre alterações. Tal fato representa desafio aos enfermeiros e gestores das políticas sociais e de saúde, pois as pessoas com DP e seus familiares carecem de atenção e cuidados por um longo período de tempo (ALVAREZ et al., 2016). Pensar no cuidador familia é pensar também em um contexto de vulnerabilidade. É provável que quanto maior for a situação de vulnerabilidade deste cuidador, quanto maior for a falta de conhecimento das condições de saúde por parte dele ou da família, maior será o grau e/ou intensidade da vulnerabilidade (SILVA, 2017). Objetivo: Conhecer o sentimento do cuidador informal primário quanto aos cuidados e o convívio com membro familiar com Doença de Parkinson.",

      "title": "[Neuropsychiatric manifestations in Parkinson's disease].",
      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's disease affecting 1-2% of the population over 60. Although diagnosed by its characteristic motor manifestations, PD may be preceded, and is frequently accompanied, by a wide range of psychiatric and cognitive symptoms. These symptoms are often more debilitating than its motor complications and it is nowadays appreciated that they can be an important cause of excess disability in PD, frequently necessitating hospitalization and institutionalization. Despite their frequent occurrence, most PD-related neuropsychiatric symptoms remain under-recognized and undertreated in clinical practice and their diagnosis is challenging because of the overlap of the somatic features of the psychiatric disorders and the motor symptoms of PD. Even when identified, there is a common perception that many of these symptoms are untreatable. Their recognition is essential not only for ascertaining the functional status of patients but also for better appreciating the nature of the neurodegenerative process in PD. These symptoms may precede the onset of motor symptoms and can be used as screening tools allowing for very early disease identification and for trials of possible diseasemodifying interventions. The pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric symptoms in PD involves complex and multifactorial mechanisms, including disease-related and psychological factors. Alterations in neurotransmitters like dopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine, involving subcortical projections and synaptic and neuronal changes involving limbic and cortical structures combine to result in these nonmotor symptoms. Potentially earlier evaluation and treatment of comorbid psychiatric and cognitive disorders in PD could improve quality of life and patient productivity, reduce morbidity and caregiver burden, and minimize healthcare costs. Management strategies include adjustment of dopaminergic medication, use of psychotropic treatments and behavioral and psychological interventions. Dopaminergic medication may precipitate neuropsychiatric conditions, such as the dopamine dysregulation syndrome. The choice of psychotropic medication for the neuropsychiatric symptoms of PD is determined by a balance between potential benefit versus side effects, mostly in terms of worsening motor symptoms. Furthermore, treatments used in general psychiatry services may not be as effective in PD. This article provides an overview and focuses on the neuropsychiatric manifestations in PD including depression, anxiety, psychosis, apathy and fatigue, personality, sexual dysfunction, sleep disorders, cognitive impairment and dementia, impulse control disorders and related behaviours. The epidemiology, pathophysiology and risk factors, clinical presentation and management of the most common neuropsychiatric complications in PD are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease (PD) and atypical parkinsonian syndromes is gaining increased clinical significance. The neurochemical and neuropathological basis in the various parkinsonian forms and even in an individual patient are not fully elucidated yet and could be heterogeneous. Loss of dopaminergic, cholinergic and noradrenergic innervation has been suggested to be the underlying neurochemical deficits for cognitive impairment and dementia in PD, but the onset of cognitive impairment and the progression to dementia may not share the same underlying neurochemical basis. Similarly, pathological evidence is also heterogeneous, ranging from subcortical pathology, limbic or cortical Lewy body type degeneration, and Alzheimer's type pathology that can be found even in the same patient with PD dementia (PDD). Typically, the prototype of early cognitive deficit in PD is a dysexecutive syndrome, but other cognitive domains are more involved when dementia develops, mainly including visuospatial, language and memory dysfunction. Functional radionuclide neuroimaging, by means of single-photon emission computed tomography and positron emission tomography, are contributing to characterize the topographic cortical pattern of cognitive impairment, as well as to define the underlying neurochemical deficit. Lastly, the advent of amyloid PET may help clarifying the meaning of amyloid load in diffuse Lewy body disease and PDD. Knowing the neurochemical and pathophysiological substrate of cognitive deficit in patients with PD or other degenerative Parkinsonisms may help the clinician in understanding the clinical condition of an individual patient in order to plan pharmacological and non-pharmacological intervention. The introduction of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors for therapy of PDD is an example of information integration between clinical-neuropsychological and pathophysiological-neurochemical aspects obtained also with the key contribution of functional neuroimaging.",

It represents a primarily geriatric syndrome that may be caused by one of several underlying conditions. There is insufficient evidence to support universal screening for cognitive impairment in older adults; however, clinicians should be alert to patient and caregiver concerns about cognitive changes and investigate such concerns with validated cognitive assessment tools. Alzheimer disease is the leading cause and prototypical form of dementia, presenting insidiously and causing progressive cognitive impairment with increasing severity over a period of years. Vascular dementia is the second most common form of dementia and often co-occurs with other progressive cognitive disorders. Lewy body dementias encompass Parkinson disease dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies, which have similar features and are differentiated primarily by the order of motor and cognitive symptom onset. Frontotemporal dementias occur earlier than other forms of dementia, progress rapidly, and often have a genetic component. An understanding of the conditions that cause dementia will assist clinicians in making an accurate diagnosis and providing appropriate treatment recommendations and counseling regarding the diagnosis and prognosis.",

Parkinson's ailment (PD) takes place due to the deficiency of dopamine hormone that regulates various activities of the human body. Researchers have diagnosed that voice defect is the major and early symptom of PD affected persons. Machine Learning (ML) has helped in detecting Parkinson's early with the aid of the usage of computer vision, natural language processing [8], speech recognition and so on. There may be no one unique symptom for the Parkinson's ailment not like the alternative neuro issues. Therefore, early and accurate diagnosis is critical to forestall or sluggish down the progression of the ailment in its tracks. The primary signs of the PD encompass tremors or shaking of fingers, palms, legs, jaw or head, stiffness of palms and trunk and in the end sluggish movement. The signs of Parkinson's ailment range from one individual to the subsequent and there may be no unique remedy for Parkinson's ailment however its impact can be lessened with the aid of early detecting and taking right medicine. Here, detecting the PD with the aid of the usage of LightGBM classifier is proposed. LightGBM is a gradient boosting framework that makes use of tree primarily based studying set of rules. LightGBM is more efficient and accurate compared to the alternative algorithms like XGBoost, CatBoost [13]. So, the performance of detecting the PD may be extended with the aid of the usage of this Classifier.",

Problems such as anxiety and depression are often comorbid with Parkinson's disease. Difficulties with aspects of cognition are also frequently present and may include deficits in executive function, working memory, planning and visuospatial problems. There is an extensive body of research that has examined the range of cognitive problems that emerge early in the disease process and often progress to dementia. More recently, research in this area has focused on identifying a stage referred to as preclinical dementia or mild cognitive impairment. There are still a number of difficulties that prevent accurate classification of patients with Parkinson's disease who will experience cogntive problems. However, identifying a period of preclinical dementia offers an opportunity to intervene to stop or slow the progression to dementia for this group.",

The typical clinical features of PD reflect well-known pathology in the dopaminergic nigrostriatal system, while extra-nigral pathology accounts for many of the non-motor features of PD. As will be subsequently discussed, the most characteristic pathologic feature of PD is neurodegeneration with Lewy body (LB) formation, but it must be acknowledged that occasionally other pathologic processes cause clinical features typical of PD. In particular, some cases of multiple system atrophy (MSA) or even progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) may be clinically mistaken for PD (Bower et al., 2002). More problematic are cases of PD with juvenile onset or those associated with an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, such as cases with Parkin and DJ-1 mutations (see below), in which LBs may not be present. Other early onset familial cases present with atypical clinical features such as early dementia and psychosis, which are not characteristic of typical PD (Gwinn-Hardy et al. 2000). Another diagnostic challenge is the relationship of cognitive dysfunction in PD to concurrent Alzheimer's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) (McKeith et al. 1996).",

Both reduced speed and saccades seen during SPEM, also known as saccadic pursuit (SP), have been studied in PD. A comprehensive literature review analyzed 26 studies of SPEM and PD. It appears that a greater proportion of PD patients have SPEM abnormalities consisting of reduced SPEM gain and/or SP compared to the normal population. It is not clear whether SPEM abnormalities are present early in the disease or begin sometime during disease progression. SPEM abnormalities may be correlated with disease severity but do not fluctuate or respond to dopaminergic medication in the same manner as other motor symptoms in PD. SPEM in PD is composed of normal SPEM interspersed with SP composed of both catch up and anticipatory saccades. This differs from other neurodegenerative disorders and may be related to an inability to inhibit extraneous saccades or to increased distraction reflecting executive dysfunction. Because the basal ganglia are involved in SPEM physiology, degeneration of the SNr neurons in PD may explain abnormal SPEM in this disorder. Since dementia, aging and medication effects influence SPEM, they should be controlled for in future studies of SPEM in PD. SP is easily detected on clinical exam and may be a biomarker for the disease or for disease progression. Oculomotor testing can be an important part of the Parkinson's exam.",

Nonetheless, in PD, the severity of the olfactory impairment seems to correlate with the severity of motor symptoms, although not in a linear fashion.\n\nInterestingly, olfactory dysfunction in PD is independent of disease stage and disease duration but is dependent on disease subtype—it is more severe in the rigidity-bradykinesia–predominant form than in the tremor-predominant form of PD.1,2 Olfactory dysfunction is also independent of dopaminergic therapy, suggesting that deficits in other neurotransmitter systems contribute to olfactory dysfunction. Indeed, neuropathologic studies of the olfactory system in PD reveal that even though there is significant neuronal loss, dopaminergic neurons in the olfactory bulb are not affected by the neurodegenerative process and do not exhibit Lewy bodies (LB).3 Somewhat surprisingly, one study reported an increase in the numbers of dopaminergic neurons in patients with PD compared to controls.4\n\nGiven the extensive interactions of the olfactory system with its environment, early hypotheses to explain olfactory system dysfunction in neurodegenerative disease in general, …",

      "abstract": "Abstract Introduction: Parkinson’s disease is a neurodegenerative disease that is often accompanied by disorders such as depression, psychotic disorders, cognitive disorders, anxiety disorders, sleep disorders, impulse control disorders. The aim of the study was to review the literature and present the characteristics of neuropsychiatric disorders occurring in people suffering from Parkinson’s disease, with the specification of the above-mentioned disorders. Material and method: The literature available on the PubMed platform from 1986 to 2022 was reviewed using the following keywords: Parkinson’s disease, depression, anxiety disorders, psychotic disorders, sleep disorders, cognitive disorders, impulse control disorders. Original studies, reviews, meta-analyzes and internet sources were analyzed. Results: The above-mentioned neuropsychiatric disorders appear with different frequency among people suffering from Parkinson’s disease and occur at different times of its duration or even precede its onset for many years. The non-motor symptoms in the form of depressed mood, energy loss or changes in the rhythm of the day may result in a delay of appropriate therapy and thus in complications. Neuropathological changes in the course of Parkinson’s disease as well as dopaminergic drugs used in its therapy influence the development of neuropsychiatric disorders. Conclusions: In order to avoid misdiagnosis, practitioners should use, e.g. scales intended for patients with Parkinson’s disease. To prevent the consequences of the aforementioned disease entities, methods of early diagnosis, determination of risk factors and standardization of the treatment process must be determined. Consistent care for patients with Parkinson’s disease is significant, not only in the neurological field, but also in the psychiatric one.",

Knowing how to differentiate the resting tremor of PD from essential tremor is an important diagnostic skill. Unlike patients with essential tremor, those with PD have other neurologic findings. A diagnosis of PD is likely if the patient has two of three major clinical features: resting tremor, bradykinesia, and rigidity. Minor signs may also be seen, including cognitive slowing, speech abnormalities, depression, dysautonomia, and sleep disturbances. The history and physical exam can determine if the patient has parkinsonism and whether the cause is Parkinson's disease.",

      "abstract": "The causes of Parkinson's disease spasticity can be divided into two broad categories. One is the muscle twitching and tension caused by Parkinson's disease itself. This is caused by the imbalance caused by the death of brain cells in the late stages of Parkinson's disease. Some cells die, and some cells do not. The resulting imbalance causes muscle twitching.There are also secondary causes, such as anti-Parkinson’s drugs, which come in many types, and can also cause muscle twitching. In addition, Parkinson's disease may be combined with other diseases, such as severe osteoporosis or epilepsy, which may also produce corresponding muscle twitches and spasms.This study proposes a new massage treatment plan for Parkinson's spasm. The massage program uses different methods, and different methods are proposed according to the spasticity of Parkinson's patients.",

Visual hallucinations may reflect delirium or neurocognitive disorder (NCD) due to Lewy body disease. This chapter focuses only on non-schizophrenic late-life psychosis. Psychosis is a gross impairment of reality testing, often manifest by hallucinations or delusions. Psychotic symptoms can be an inherent aspect of an illness or a secondary complicating factor. Earlier-onset/primary psychotic disorders, schizophrenia and related disorders, bipolar disorder with psychotic features, often extend into old age. Severe functional disability affects the surrounding environment and worsens caregiver stress, leading to reduced productivity beyond that of the patient. The aging brain shows a disproportion in the synthesis, discharge, and inactivation of noradrenergic, serotonergic, and dopaminergic neurons, loss of resilience, and loss of cognitive reserve, all increasing the risk for psychosis developing as a complication of an underlying pathology.",

      "abstract": "The link between heart and skeletal muscle disorders is based on similar molecular, anatomical and clinical features, which are shared by the 'primary' cardiomyopathies and 'primary' neuromuscular disorders. There are, however, some peculiarities that are typical of cardiac and skeletal muscle disorders. Skeletal muscle weakness presenting at any age may indicate a primary neuromuscular disorder (associated with creatine kinase elevation as in dystrophinopathies), a mitochondrial disease (particularly if encephalopathy, ocular myopathy, retinitis, neurosensorineural deafness, lactic acidosis are present), a storage disorder (progressive exercise intolerance, cognitive impairment and retinitis pigmentosa, as in Danon disease), or metabolic disorders (hypoglycaemia, metabolic acidosis, hyperammonaemia or other specific biochemical abnormalities). In such patients, skeletal muscle weakness usually precedes the cardiomyopathy and dominates the clinical picture. Nevertheless, skeletal involvement may be subtle, and the first clinical manifestation of a neuromuscular disorder may be the occurrence of heart failure, conduction disorders or ventricular arrhythmias due to cardiomyopathy. ECG and echocardiogram, and eventually, a more detailed cardiovascular evaluation may be required to identify early cardiac involvement. Paediatric and adult cardiologists should be proactive in screening for neuromuscular and related disorders to enable diagnosis in probands and evaluation of families with a focus on the identification of those at risk of cardiac arrhythmia and emboli who may require specific prophylactic treatments, for example, pacemaker, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator and anticoagulation.",

      "title": "Frontotemporal Neurocognitive Disorder",
      "abstract": "Frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder (FTNCD) represents a spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases that compromise function of frontal brain networks, resulting in cognitive and behavioral deficits (see Box 65- ). More often referred to as frontotemporal dementia in the medical literature, FTNCD is a common cause of dementia among patients ages 45–65 years and comprises two sometimes overlapping clinical syndromes: behavioral-variant frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder (Bv-FTNCD) and language-variant frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder (Lv-FTNCD) (Table 3- ). The latter syndrome includes two subtypes: progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA) and semantic dementia. DSM-5 Diagnostic Criteria for Major or Mild Frontotemporal Neurocognitive Disorder The criteria are met for major or mild neurocognitive disorder. The disturbance has insidious onset and gradual progression. Either (1) or (2): Behavioral variant: Three or more of the following behavioral symptoms: Behavioral disinhibition. Apathy or inertia. Loss of sympathy or empathy. Perseverative, stereotyped or compulsive/ritualistic behavior. Hyperorality and dietary changes. Prominent decline in social cognition and/or executive abilities. Language variant: Prominent decline in language ability, in the form of speech production, word finding, object naming, grammar, or word comprehension. Relative sparing of learning and memory and perceptual-motor function. The disturbance is not better explained by cerebrovascular disease, another neurodegenerative disease, the effects of a substance, or another mental, neurological, or systemic disorder. Probable frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder is diagnosed if either of the following is present; otherwise, possible frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder should be diagnosed: Evidence of a causative frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder genetic mutation, from either family history or genetic testing. Evidence of disproportionate frontal and/or temporal lobe involvement from neuroimaging. Possible frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder is diagnosed if there is no evidence of a genetic mutation, and neuroimaging has not been performed. Coding note: For probable major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration, with behavioral disturbance, code first 331.19 (G31.09) frontotemporal disease, followed by 294.11 (F02.81) probable major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration, with behavioral disturbance. For probable major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration, without behavioral disturbance, code first 331.19 (G31.09) frontotemporal disease, followed by 294.10 (F02.80) probable major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration, without behavioral disturbance. For possible major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration, code 331.9 (G31.9) possible major neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration. ( Note: Do not use the additional code for frontotemporal disease. Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but should still be indicated in writing.) For mild neurocognitive disorder due to frontotemporal lobar degeneration, code 331.83 (G31.84). ( Note: Do not use the additional code for frontotemporal disease. Behavioral disturbance cannot be coded but should still be indicated in writing.) FTNCD involves a variety of largely nonoverlapping neuropathological patterns that are distinct from those observed among persons with Alzheimer's disease (AD). These frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) pathological subtypes include diseases that are characterized by aggregation of one of three proteins in affected frontal or temporal areas of the cerebral cortex: tau, transactive response DNA-binding protein (TDP-43), and fused-in-sarcoma (FUS). Other less common pathologies have been described. Clinical symptomatology may provide clues about the underlying FTLD subtype, but there are no strict associations between Bv-FTNCD or Lv-FTNCD and a particular histopathology. Clinical features of behavioral-variant frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder (Bv-FTNCD) and language-variant frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder (Lv-FTNCD), including progressive nonfluent aphasia (PNFA) and semantic dementia (SD) Subtype Symptoms Cognitive profile Neuroimaging Motor findings Neuropathology Bv-FTNCD Behavioral disinhibition, apathy, loss of empathy, repetitive or stereotyped motor behaviors, and hyperorality Deficits in attention, working memory, set shifting, mental flexibility, response inhibition, and abstract reasoning, with relative preservation of memory and visuospatial function Right hemispheric frontal and/or anterior temporal atrophy, particularly involving the orbitofrontal, insular, and anterior cingulate cortices Motor neuron disease in 10%–15%; Parkinsonian findings or supranuclear gaze disturbance in others FTLD-tau, FTLD-TDP, FTLD-FUS, and others Lv-FTNCD (PNFA) Slow, effortful, and telegraphic speech; dysarthria; agrammatisms; and occasional asymmetric right foot and hand motor impairment Agrammatical speech, decreased phonemic fluency, and apraxia of speech, with relative preservation of memory and visuospatial function Left frontoinsular and perisylvian atrophy Asymmetric Parkinsonian signs, apraxia, focal dystonia, myoclonus, alien limb phenomenon, supranuclear gaze disturbance, axial rigidity, and postural instability FTLD-tau in most cases Lv-FTNCD (SD) Decreased object naming and single word comprehension Impaired naming, surface dyslexia, and prosopagnosia, with relative preservation of memory and visuospatial function Asymmetric anterior and lateral temporal atrophy, usually left more than right Less common than in other FTNCD subtypes FTLD-TDP in most cases Note. FTLD = frontotemporal lobar degeneration; FUS = fused-in-sarcoma; TDP = transactive response DNA-binding protein. There are two general approaches to treatment of FTNCD: disease modification and symptomatic management. Disease-modifying therapies target pathogenic molecules and thereby alter, slow, or arrest the disease process. Unfortunately, no disease-modifying therapies are available for persons with FTNCD at this time. Symptomatic management attempts to control disease manifestations alone, and it is the only approach to FTNCD currently available.",

Progressive loss of nigral neurons with Lewy bodies is considered an essential neuropathological feature. Recent studies, however, indicate that nigral degeneration is only a part of this synucleinopathy, and clinical symptoms go far beyond motor parkinsonism. Olfactory disturbances, autonomic dysfunction, pain, sleep fragmentation, depression, and dementia with or without psychosis are frequently seen. The variability in the expression of these signs and symptoms suggests multiple causes and/or pathogeneses within the present diagnostic disease entity. In this article, a recently proposed staging of PD-related brain pathology will be correlated with the various clinical expressions. It will be argued that the specific topographical sequence of the pathology, depending on the extent and progression of the degenerative process at defined sites, may explain the individually variable expression of this disease.",

      "abstract": "A task force of the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society (MDS) recently published a tremor classification scheme that is based on the nosologic principle of two primary axes for classifying an illness: clinical manifestations (Axis 1) and etiology (Axis 2). An Axis 1 clinical syndrome is a recurring group of clinical symptoms, signs (physical findings) and possibly laboratory results that suggest the presence of at least one underlying Axis 2 etiology. Syndromes must be defined and used consistently to be of value in finding specific etiologies and effective treatments. The MDS task force concluded that essential tremor is a common neurological syndrome that has never been defined consistently by clinicians and researchers. The MDS task force defined essential tremor as a syndrome of bilateral upper limb action tremor of at least 3 years duration, with or without tremor in other locations (e.g., head, voice, or lower limbs), in the absence of other neurological signs (e.g., dystonia, parkinsonism, myoclonus, ataxia, peripheral neuropathy and cognitive impairment). Deviations from this definition should not be labeled as essential tremor. Patients with additional questionably-abnormal signs or with signs of uncertain relevance to tremor are classified as essential tremor plus. The MDS classification scheme encourages a thorough unbiased phenotyping of patients with tremor, with no assumptions of etiology, pathology, pathophysiology or relationship to other neurological disorders. The etiologies, pathology and clinical course of essential tremor are too heterogeneous for this syndrome to be viewed as a disease or a family of diseases.",

      "abstract": "Soggetti portatori di disabilitŕ presentano spesso disturbi endocrini e metabolici, primitivi o secondari alla menomazione psico-fisica. La disabilitŕ č spesso provocata da malattie geneticamente determinate, da traumi cranici o midollari con conseguenti alterazioni neurologiche, o da patologie infettive cerebrali con esiti significativi. Si comprende quindi facilmente la possibile associazione fra la disabilitŕ e disordini della funzione ipotalamica e ipofisaria, con quadri di ipopituitarismo di varia entitŕ. Ne conseguono manifestazioni cliniche, spesso subdole e non facilmente diagnosticabili, almeno nella fase iniziale, che, se non vengono riconosciute tempestivamente, possono avere conseguenze serie. Ad esempio un deficit di ormone della crescita o dell'ormone tiroideo o una carenza di cortisolo, in etŕ infantile possono dar luogo a gravi conseguenze patologiche. Un'altra patologia associata alla disabilitŕ č l'obesitŕ, sia ipotalamica che conseguente alla scarsa attivitŕ fisica. L'obesitŕ facilita lo sviluppo di diabete mellito, peraltro associato talora a malattie geneticamente determinate. Pertanto in una struttura residenziale per disabili č necessaria la consulenza di uno specialista endocrinologo al fine di riconoscere tempestivamente, sulla base di esami clinici e di laboratorio, eventuali patologie endocrine e metaboliche. Questo consente di intraprendere subito una terapia sostitutiva. L'assistenza sanitaria specialistica comprende l'attuazione di schemi di terapia adeguati, la compliance alla terapia, l'attuazione di idonei percorsi diagnostici e di follow-up. Grandi difficoltŕ si incontrano inevitabilmente nell'attuare programmi di attivitŕ fisica e di dieta al fine di limitare l'aumento ponderale. Un corretto intervento in questo campo richiede la collaborazione fra lo specialista e la strut- tura residenziale che assiste il disabile e percorsi di facilitazione per queste attivitŕ anche attraverso convenzioni stipulate ad hoc. Č fondamentale, infine, l'ottimizzazione di un'assistenza multidisciplinare ben integrata.",

      "abstract": "It is well-known that Lewy body Parkinson disease (PD) gives rise to a motor disorder; that this is associated with degeneration of meso-striatal dopaminergic neurons; and that meso-striatal dopaminergic neurons interact with frontal-subcortical loops. When one turns to the dementia of PD (PDD) or that of dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB)—2 syndromes that are presently only distinguished by an arbitrary cutoff in the timing of motor compared to cognitive dimensions, but are quite possibly manifestations of the same pathologic process—the heart, for many, has often led the mind in assuming that cognitive decline must also relate to dysfunction of (nonmotor) frontal-subcortical loops or dopaminergic degeneration of meso-limbic or meso-cortical projections. Aside from possible prejudice in this assumption, there may be notable methodologic problems in being too focused on a system-specific hypothesis for cognitive decline in a neurodegenerative disease. Focusing exclusively on imaging the dopaminergic system in PDD/DLB, for instance, and finding correlations with behavior could indicate a causal relationship, but if imaging and behavioral change are each a function of disease duration or severity of …",

      "abstract": "The term Parkinson's disease has been changed in 'Parkinson's diseases' to describe different clinical entities observed in several studies investigating the existence of PD subtypes. PD patients could be grouped based on clinical features. By considering only motor symptoms, we can classically distinguish two groups: \" the tremorigen-form\" and \"akinetic- rigidity-form\" where resting tremor and akinesia/bradikynesia and rigidity are the most motor predominant symptoms, respectively. Non-motor symptoms (NMSs) are practically always present during the course of the disease and some of them (constipation, depressive status, hyposmia and anxiety) could even exist before the onset of classical motor symptoms. Many other NMSs and in particular hallucinations, cognitive impairment, sleep disorders and difficulty in swallowing strongly affect the advanced stage of disease, and represent a real therapeutic challenge when these symptoms are simultaneously present with different severity. If not adequately treated, they can increase the risk of hospitalization and admissions in nursing home, and profoundly and negatively influence the quality of life and participation in social activity of these patients. PD subtypes according to the combination of motor and non-motor symptoms have been recently proposed. This classification derives from cluster analysis which permits to identify statistically distinct subtypes of Parkinsonian patients according to the relevance of both motor and non-motor symptoms. In this point of view, we propose a schematic therapeutic approach of motor and non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease according to cluster symptoms presentation (motor and non-motor symptoms) and using medications that act on multiple domains of PD symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Increasingly, many centres around the world are delivering multidisciplinary care for patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).1 2 Indeed, a multidisciplinary team approach currently seems inevitable for anyone who understands even a little about PD. After all, this really is a wretched disorder, with a complex and diverse phenotype. Patients become progressively incapacitated, not only because of the well known motor symptoms (bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor, gait impairment and postural instability), but also because of a wide variety of non-motor symptoms. These include neuropsychiatric disorders (cognitive disturbances, hallucinations, psychosis), sleep disorders (insomnia, rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder, periodic leg movements), autonomic dysfunction (orthostatic hypotension, constipation, urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction) and pain from various sources (eg, central pain, painful off period dystonia). Not surprisingly, PD is regarded by patients as one of the most unbearable disorders around, ranked second on the respective lists for both motor and cognitive disorders.3 Perhaps even more telling is the fact that many immediate caregivers are on the brink of succumbing to the pressure of living with someone with PD.4–6 Moreover, conventional therapies—drug treatment and stereotactic deep brain surgery—offer only partial and temporary relief, particularly in more advanced disease.7 Against this background, any neurologist who still feels that a single discipline suffices to combat this debilitating disease must seem almost heartless, or at least a bit naive. And any potential critics should be consoled by the fact that multidisciplinary care has already won its spurs in other areas of neurology—for example, stroke units.8",

In the diagnosis, the key is the correct assessment of neurological status, its dynamics, as well as confirmed by paraclinical research methods, in patients with neurological diseases, which in themselves can lead to the development of mental disorders. However, ignoring the features of mental disorders, the lack of a clinically adjusted approach to this category of patients, difficulties in highlighting the most significant symptoms, can lead to misdiagnosis. Therefore, it is so important to know not only the neurological manifestations of certain neurological diseases, but also to properly navigate their mental manifestations.

      "title": "Study on Neurological Soft Signs in patients with ObsessiveCompulsive Disorder.",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:\r\nIn the era of expanding recent advancements and progress made in\r\nThe field of neuro psychiatry , a relatively neglected aspect is complete\r\nNeurological examination which is non invasive, easy to administer and\r\nProvides wealth of information regarding the various aspects of the\r\nDisease. Impaired neurological performance has been documented in\r\nVarious psychiatric conditions and the concept of neurological\r\nExamination in psychiatry ,a time old concept whose significance has\r\nGained importance with blurring of the thin line between neurology and\r\nPsychiatry leading to the concept of neuropsychiatry. Neuro biological\r\nUnderpinnings of psychiatric conditions further propelled the significance\r\nOf neurological examination in psychiatry.\r\nNeurological examination in psychiatry, particularly has two\r\nGeneral aspects\r\n1] Examination for ‘hard signs’ or ‘major signs’ or ‘localizable\r\nSigns’ such as cranial nerve lesion, motor deficit, sensory impairment,\r\nReflex asymmetry which reflects presence or absence of neuropathology\r\nAnd a localizing lesion.\r\n2] Evaluation of performance decrements in neurological domains\r\nWithout any identifiable neurological lesion or disorder (Sanders &\r\nKeshavan, 1998).\r\nAs mentioned above these decrements in neurological domains\r\nMainly includes the concept of our focus “NEUROLOGICAL SOFT\r\nSIGNS” or “SOFT NEUROLOGICAL SIGNS”.(Sanders & Keshavan,\r\n1998)\r\nNEUROLOGICAL SOFT SIGNS\r\nDr. Loretta Bender ,a pioneer in neuro psychiatric aspects of\r\nChildhood disorders introduced the concept of neurological soft signs in\r\n1947 in reference to non diagnostic neurological abnormalities seen in\r\nChildren with schizophrenia .(Sadock, Benjamin James., Sadock, 2007)\r\nDEFINITION\r\nNSS are defined by Shaffer and o’connor as\r\n“ Non normative performance (s) on a motor or sensory test(s)\r\nWhich would be identical or akin to test(s) of traditional neurological\r\nExamination, but elicited from an individual who shows none of the\r\nFeatures of fixed or transient neurological disorder ”\r\nShaffer et al also proposed that to consider a sign as an NSS it should\r\nHave following features\r\n1] No association should exist between an observed behaviour and\r\nA positive history of neurological disease or trauma\r\n2] It should not be a pathognomonic sign of any neurologic disease\r\nOr encephalopathy\r\n3] It should not be indicate any specific CNS pathology\r\nThus the NSS are minor neurological deviation in motor and sensory\r\nFunction that are not localized to any specific area of the brain and not\r\nCharacteristic of any specific neurological condition ,mostly indicating\r\nDiffuse cerebral dysfunction.\r\nEver since they have been introduced they were termed as ‘soft\r\nSigns’, ‘non focal signs’, ‘diffuse signs’, ‘minimal brain damage\r\nSyndrome’ due to their lack of specificity ,validity or localization at that\r\nTime. The term ‘soft’ also signifies the nature of wide but blurred\r\nBoundaries of varying domains like EEG findings ,behaviour disturbance,\r\nLearning disorders, neurological functions that were considered under the\r\nUmbrella of soft signs.(Sanders & Keshavan, 1998)\r\nThe initial focus of these NSS remained mainly in the field of child\r\nPsychiatry with description of concepts of ‘Minimal Brain Damage’ in\r\nChildren with hyperactivity, impulsivity and with no demonstrable\r\nNeurological lesion. Later from 1990 with quantification of validated and\r\nStandardised instruments for assessment of these signs, the focus shifted\r\nTo major psychiatric conditions leading to exhaustive research in the\r\nSubject which provided significant understanding of the neurobiology,\r\nNeuro anatomical correlates, genetic underpinnings , neuro developmental\r\nBasis, endophenotypic markers and predictors of neuropsychological\r\nDysfunction in certain psychiatric conditions.\r\nWith this brief introduction about the neurological soft signs ,we\r\nNow focus on existing documented literature that has changed the concept\r\nOf these NSS, their significance in psychiatric conditions and the various\r\nAspects of their relation to Obsessive compulsive disorder which is the\r\nMain focus of our study.",

AF is classified into three categories; (1) pure autonomic failure, without associated neurological disorders, (2) AF with Parkinson's disease (PD), and (3) AF with multiple system atrophy (Shy-Drager syndrome) (Bannister, 1988). AF with PD is pathologically characterized by neuronal cell degeneration in the intermediolateral column and the substantia nigra, together with Lewy bodies mainly in the pigmented nuclei in the brain stem. Patients with PD occasionally develop syncope or dizziness due to orthostatic hypotension and/or postprandial hypotension as well as urorectal disturbances as the initial symptoms, and are followed by parkinsonism. Levodopa is usually effective for parkinsonism but the prognosis is rather poor. AF with PD could be regarded as a form of 'the Lewy body disease' according to Kosaka's clinicopathological entity (1984).",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a highly heterogeneous disorder, which probably consists of multiple subtypes. Aggregation of misfolded alpha-synuclein and propagation of these proteinacious aggregates through interconnected neural networks is believed to be a crucial pathogenetic factor. It has been hypothesized that the initial pathological alpha-synuclein aggregates originate in the enteric or peripheral nervous system (PNS) and invade the central nervous system (CNS) via retrograde vagal transport. However, evidence from neuropathological studies suggests that not all PD patients can be reconciled with this hypothesis. Importantly, a small fraction of patients do not show pathology in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus. Here, it is hypothesized that PD can be divided into a PNS-first and a CNS-first subtype. The former is tightly associated with REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) during the prodromal phase and is characterized by marked autonomic damage before involvement of the dopaminergic system. In contrast, the CNS-first phenotype is most often RBD-negative during the prodromal phase and characterized by nigrostriatal dopaminergic dysfunction prior to involvement of the autonomic PNS. The existence of these subtypes is supported by in vivo imaging studies of RBD-positive and RBD-negative patient groups and by histological evidence- reviewed herein. The present proposal provides a fresh hypothesis-generating framework for future studies into the etiopathogenesis of PD and seems capable of explaining a number of discrepant findings in the neuropathological literature.",

Loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra results in neurological symptoms, including the characteristic motor symptoms seen in Parkinson’s Disease. In addition to the distressing motor symptoms, neuropsychiatric symptoms and treatment-related symptoms are common features of Parkinson’s Disease. Symptom constellations vary from early-stage to late-stage and necessitate that treatment approaches evolve throughout disease progression. Given the range of psychological and cognitive challenges posed by Parkinson’s Disease, health psychologists must recognize relevant symptomology and utilize appropriate tools to manage the everchanging psychological sequelae. When done effectively, psychologists can play a critical role in the management of psychological symptoms and the improvement of quality of life for individuals diagnosed with Parkinson’s Disease.

The person may or may not have insight in that he or she is having a hallucination. Psychotic symptoms such as hallucinations and delusions are the cardinal features of psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, schizo-affective disorder, delusional disorder, and brief psychotic disorder.

No prior systematic analysis has assessed clinical clues predicting later development of PD or Parkinson-plus syndrome. <strong>Methods:</strong> We identified patients with AOPLLD from medical records. We excluded patients who had not been diagnosed by a neurologist, and who had a preexisting diagnosis of PD, psychogenic, or secondary dystonia. Records were subdivided into those who later developed PD or Parkinson-plus disorders and those who did not. The following clinical characteristics were compared between the two groups: dystonia onset age, type of dystonia, levodopa response, anticholinergic response, and family history of Parkinsonism or tremor. <strong>Results:</strong> Twenty-two AOPLLD patients were identified: 77% female; the median dystonia onset age was 53 years. Eight (37%) developed Parkinson's disease; 2 (9%) developed corticobasal syndrome. Twelve patients (54%) did not develop Parkinsonism after a median follow-up period of 1.5 years. There was a significant difference in leg dystonia levodopa response between the two groups (p=0.02). <strong>Conclusion:</strong> In patients with AOPLLD, leg dystonia with levodopa response is associated with the future development of PD.",

Pojavnost Parkinsonove bolesti raste s životnom dobi. Etioloski se dijeli u 3 grupe: idiopatski, postencefaliticni i neurolepticni oblik. Dijagnostika se temelji na prisutnosti tri glavna simptoma,a to su tremor, rigor i bradikinezija. Nema laboratorijske pretrage koja ce potvrditi bolest. Problemi koji se javljaju se mogu podjeliti na tjelesne, psiholoske i socijalne. Simptomi koji karakteriziraju Parkinsonovu bolest su: akineticki tremor, rigor, bradikinezija i posturalna nestabilnost. Depresija, anksioznost i poremecaj spavanja se pojavljuju u vidu psiholoskih problema. Socijalni problemi oboljelih su položaj u drustvu, prisutnost predrasuda i neadekvatnih arhitektonskih barijera. Bolest se ne može u potpunosti izlijeciti. Cilj lijecenja je usporiti tijek bolesti, a to se provodi primjenom lijekova i fizikalne terapije. U ovom radu je analizirano istraživanje o stavovima okoline prema osobama s Parkinsonovom bolesti. Istraživanje je obuhvacalo 26 ucenika 4. razreda Srednje skole Pakrac, smjera fizioterapeutski tehnicar. Upitnik koji se koristio za istraživanje je „Stavovi okoline prema osobama s tjelesnim teskocama“. Upitnik sadrži tri komponente: Kognitivna komponenta stavova (1 i 2) i Afektivnu komponentu stavova. Kognitivna komponenta stavova se dijeli na implikaciju devijantnih karakteristika i tragicno sagledavanje osoba s tjelesnim ostecenjima. Afektivna komponenta podrazumijeva emocionalan odnos ispitanika prema oboljelima. Rezultati istraživanja su pokazali da ucenici imaju pozitivne stavove prema oboljelima od Parkinsonove bolesti, a najvise prema njihovom odnosu u drustvu. Ucenici ne pokazuju neugodno ponasanje, nesigurnost te strah od izravnog kontakta u prisutnosti oboljelih.",

PD is known mainly by its cardinal motor symptoms which are believed to be associated with dopamine deficiency in the nigrostriatal pathway as a result of DAergic neurons degeneration in the substantia nigra pars compacta of the midbrain. However, other brain structures degenerate (non-dopaminergic abnormalities) in PD resulting in other symptoms known as non-motor symptoms (NMS). NMS and non-DAergic abnormalities are sometimes present before diagnosis and almost inevitably emerge with the disease progression. Hence, they might play a tremendously important role in the management and sometimes even the diagnosis of PD. This chapter will provide an overview on the neuropathobiology of NMS in PD.",

Olfactory dysfunction occurs early in the disease process, is independent of disease stage, duration, and treatment. However, olfactory dysfunction appears to be dependent on disease subtype. Olfaction is mildly impaired or preserved in most of the parkinsonism-plus syndromes (PPS). This provides a means of differential diagnosis between typical PD and PPS. Olfactory function is impaired also in familial forms of parkinsonism in which the genetic defect is known. In familial parkinsonism, olfactory function is impaired in both typical PD and PPS phenotypes. Olfactory dysfunction does not appear to be a manifestation of dopamine deficiency. Olfactory dysfunction is also associated with other neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), Huntington's disease (HD), as well as with normal aging. The neuropathological changes observed in the olfactory system in PD and other neurodegenerative diseases appear to be disease-specific, raising the possibility that olfactory dysfunction may be the result of a central rather than a peripheral process. The cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying olfactory dysfunction in PD and other neurodegenerative diseases remain unknown.",

Particular attention deserves the timing of the onset of motor or cognitive symptoms, which is extremely useful issue giving the frequent overlapping between neurodegenerative diseases. Aim of this review is to provide a description of typical clinical and imaging features of all neurodegenerative diseases, especially idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (PD) and Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Particular attention will be devoted to the cluster of symptoms at the moment of the diagnosis. Based on early starting symptoms (cognitive or extrapiramidal) we will introduce criteria to differentiate AD from fronto-Temporal Dementia (FTD), Lewy bodies dementia (DLB) and Vascular dementia (VaD), and between PD, Vascular Parkinsonism (VP) and DLB. All these diseases are characterized by cognitive deficits. PD will be suspected if cognitive impairment occurs at least one year after the onset of the motor symptoms while VP and DLB are more likely if cognitive deficits and motor symptoms appear simultaneously. Finally, we will focus on parkinsonian signs plus other motor symptoms at the time of the diagnosis. The presence of cerebellar or pyramidal signs, with falls and autonomic dysfunction, with or without cognitive deficit should help to consider potential causes of atypical parkinsonism including cortical-basal degeneration (CBD), multiple system atrophy (MSA) and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP).",

It is likely that the two conditions share common functional and biochemical characteristics.

      "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder resulting from the death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and the appearance of protein aggregates in neuronal cell bodies composed predominantly of alpha-synuclein, known as Lewy bodies. PD is now recognized as a multisystem disorder characterized by severe motor impairment and various non-motor symptoms. Cognitive decline is one of the most common and worrisome non-motor symptoms. Moderate cognitive impairment (CI), diagnosed already in the early stages of PD, usually leads to deep dementia. The main types of CI observed in PD include executive dysfunction, attention, and memory disfunction, visuospatial decline, and verbal deficits. According to the literature, the following mechanisms play a significant role in the development of cognitive dysfunctions in PD: (1) changes in the conformational structure of synaptic proteins; (2) disruption of synaptic transmission; (3) neuroinflammation (pathological activation of neuroglia); (4) mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress; (5) metabolic conditions; (6) functional remodeling of the neural networks. The listed molecular and synaptic changes in the brain can lead to the death of dopamine-synthesizing cells of the substantia nigra and dysfunction of other mediator systems, as well as partial cellular atrophy in the neocortex and subcortical nuclei. As a result, the functioning of neural networks involved in the transmission of information related to the regulation of motor activity and cognitive functions is disrupted. Elucidation of the causes of changes occurring in PD and the search for methods to eliminate them will help create new approaches in the treatment of this disease. The aim of the review is to analyze the pathological processes in the brain that underlie the onset of cognitive impairment in PD. The review analyzes the data obtained both from studies on patients with PD and animal (rodents and primates) models of this disease used for the evaluation of the mechanisms underlying etiology and the development of PD in humans.",

      "abstract": "Increasingly, many centres around the world are delivering multidisciplinary care for patients with Parkinson's disease (PD).1 2 Indeed, a multidisciplinary team approach currently seems inevitable for anyone who understands even a little about PD. After all, this really is a wretched disorder, with a complex and diverse phenotype. Patients become progressively incapacitated, not only because of the well known motor symptoms (bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor, gait impairment and postural instability), but also because of a wide variety of non-motor symptoms. These include neuropsychiatric disorders (cognitive disturbances, hallucinations, psychosis), sleep disorders (insomnia, rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder, periodic leg movements), autonomic dysfunction (orthostatic hypotension, constipation, urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction) and pain from various sources (eg, central pain, painful off period dystonia). Not surprisingly, PD is regarded by patients as one of the most unbearable disorders around, ranked second on the respective lists for both motor and cognitive disorders.3 Perhaps even more telling is the fact that many immediate caregivers are on the brink of succumbing to the pressure of living with someone with PD.4,–,6 Moreover, conventional therapies—drug treatment and stereotactic deep brain surgery—offer only partial and temporary relief, particularly in more advanced disease.7 Against this background, any neurologist who still feels that a single discipline suffices to combat this debilitating disease must seem almost heartless, or at least a bit naive. And any potential critics should be consoled by the fact that multidisciplinary care has already won its spurs in other areas of neurology—for example, stroke units.8\n\nLuckily for PD patients, help is on the way. Evidence is growing to support the effectiveness of various allied health disciplines. Thus far, the case is strongest for specific physiotherapy techniques, such as cueing.9 But there are also practice based guidelines—from accumulating research evidence, …",

You have to suspect on Parkinson disease when patient have characteristic tremor when resting, reduced mobility and rigidity. For now, there is no cure that can completely stop disease. The goals of treatment is to affect symptoms and easet hem. Parkinson disease demands correct and balanced nutrition to achieve satisfactory level of energy and better drugs performance. Dementia is a common complication of Parkinson disease. Disease, with it's symptoms, directly disrupts quality of life and social inclusion of patient. Although several models of care currently exist, most practitioners operate from a monodisciplinary or a consultative standpoint. Nursing care is one of the important factors in care process of PD patient, and it has to be well planned and individualized (adapted to the patient and his needs). Nursing care demands holistic approach, it is directed to satisfy their needs, to prevent complications, to preserve independence as long as possible and to educate the patient and his family.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative movement disorder distinguished by resting tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, postural instability and gait disturbances. Non-motor symptoms including dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system, neuropsychiatric changes, sensory and sleep disturbances are also common. PD may be diagnosed at any age but is most common in aged populations affecting approximately 1% of individuals over 60 years of age and rising to approximately 4% in age groups above 85 years of age (de Lau and Breteler, 2006; Van Den Eeden et al., 2003). It has become apparent that differential subgroups may be categorised by age of onset, dominant symptoms and progression. Two key subsets include lateand early-onset PD. Late-onset PD is typically identified in individuals over the age of 70 and is characterised by postural imbalance and gait impairment with accompanying rigidity and akinesia. Early-onset PD is typified by a dominant tremor and slow progression in motor decline, and is primarily identified in individuals less than 50 years of age (Lewis et al., 2005; Selikhova et al., 2009). The lead pathological identifier of PD is moderate to severe dopaminergic neuronal loss within the substantia nigra pars compacta with accompanying Lewy pathology in surviving neurons (Daniel and Lees, 1993; Dickson et al., 2009; Gelb et al., 1999). It is thought that the combination of Lewy pathology and dopaminergic cell loss in PD leads to striatal dopamine depletion, and this accounts for the motor symptoms (Obeso et al., 2008). Earlier diagnosis of PD is important as motor symptoms do not become apparent until approximately 60% of dopaminergic neurons are lost (Fearnley and Lees, 1991; Pakkenberg et al., 1991). Current treatments are available to manage the symptoms of PD. Medications such as the dopamine precursor L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA) and inhibitors of dopamine metabolism are used to supplement the reduced dopamine level. Deep brain stimulation is an alternative treatment. The patient undergoes surgery to implant an electrical stimulation device into the affected region of the basal ganglia. The electrical impulses generated by the device interfere with the abnormal signals that are causing the tremor, thereby alleviating some of the symptoms of the disease (reviewed in (Hurelbrink and Lewis, 2010)). To identify treatments that address or arrest the progressive nature of PD, an understanding of the molecular mechanisms responsible for the loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons and associated Lewy pathology must be delineated.",

Pathologically, Parkinson's disease is defined by the presence of Lewy bodies, which result from the aggregation of alpha-synuclein. Braak, et al. have proposed that the aggregation of alpha-synuclein pathology in Parkinson's disease begins in the medulla oblongata and progresses predictably, reaching the substantia nigra in the midbrain after affecting the brain stem. Apart from the motor symptoms of the disease, non-motor symptoms may precede the evoked potentials, and these include cognitive dysfunction, psychiatric disorder, sleep disorders and autonomic dysfunction.To describe and discuss the non-motor symptoms and diagnostic tests and procedures which may provide a pre-motor diagnosis of Parkinson's disease.Non-motor symptoms are now accepted as an integral part of the clinical spectrum of Parkinson's disease and there is evidence to suggest that olfactory dysfunction and sleep disturbances may occur before motor signs. The presence of various non-motor symptoms in conjunction with imaging studies has the potential to detect patients with Parkinson's disease in the pre-motor phase. Nevertheless, a larger number of studies are required, in particular cohort design of subjects in risk.",

      "title": "Gait disorders in the elderly.",
      "abstract": "gaIt and balance both declIne wIth normal, or non-pathological aging. Gait and posture tend to become parkinsonian, meaning “looks like Parkinson’s disease.” This connotes a stooped posture, reduced armswing, reduced stride length and a tendency towards a flat foot strike However, a large number of pathological changes may develop contributing to this normal decline. Some of these involve the nervous systems, central or peripheral, and some involve non-neurological systems which not neurologically controlled. It is obvious that gait difficulties and imbalance contribute to reduced quality of life. It is uncommon to meet a patient in a nursing home who walks normally. Gait impairment and the risk of falls is one major contributing factor to nursing home placement. Falls are common in the elderly. There are different definition for “fall,” but the World Health Organization definition of a fall (E880-E888 in ICD 9 and W00-W19 in ICD 10) requires the person to come to rest “inadvertently” at a lower level than intended. I consider trips and slips as different although possible indicators of a falling tendency. We all may slip on ice, or trip over a plug, but it is an indicator of a problem if it is recurrent, suggesting a problem correcting the loss of balance. Over 30% of community dwelling people over 65 fall at least once each year and falls were the leading cause of traumatic death and morbidity in the elderly. The death rate from falls skyrockets with age, increasing from ten per 100,000 per year for ages 65-74, to 147 per 100,000 per year for those over age 85. The financial costs alone are astronomical and increasing. The claim that “falls among older adults are preventable,” is akin to stating that cigarette smoking or drug addiction or obesity is preventable. The correct statement is, and should be, “falls in the elder can be reduced.” They cannot be prevented, partly due to impaired cognitive function that often accompanies gait disorders in the elderly. My own experience, from talking to patients and from reviewing doctor notes is that many patients do not have their walking evaluated during their routine primary care physician (PCP) appointments. In a study of hospitalized patients, often admitted after a fall, gait was not documented on the chart. The reasons for this are manifold, but I believe that two, which are virtually never discussed, are: doctors have not been taught how to evaluate gait and that most doctors lack a vocabulary for gait, and therefore have difficulty describing what they see. Walking requires the ability to stand, maintain position (keeping center of gravity over the feet) and advance. The overall controlling mechanism is the brain, but, obviously, the feet, ankles, knees and hips must be able to bear the weight; the muscles must be sufficiently strong. The inner ear must be able to determine the direction of gravity’s pull. Binocular vision is important for judging distance and compensating for other impaired sensory systems. The peripheral nerves must convey information from the environment in to the spinal cord, and then out to the appropriate muscles at the appropriate time (“garbage in, garbage out”). And aging affects each of these systems, often in very unequal ways. Determining an exact cause of a gait abnormality is sometimes impossible, although identifying which systems contribute to the process is usually not that difficult to determine.",

The clinical manifestations are similar to those seen in other degenerative disorders that cause dementia with some minimal differences; some specific disturbances such as depression and a decline in verbal fluency may identify individuals who are in the early stages of dementia. While patients advanced in age seem to be at higher risk of dementia with Parkinson's disease, the risk is uniform throughout the duration of disease. There are no known environmental risk factors specific for dementia, though many putative factors have been identified for Parkinson's disease.

      "abstract": "Psychiatric disorders (PDs) in neurology are more frequent then it verified in routine exam, not only in the less developed but also in large and very developed neurological departments. Furthermore, psychiatric symptoms (PSs) in neurological disorders (NDs) among primary health care physicians and other specialties are often neglected. Anxiety and depression are most common, but hallucinations, delusions, obsessive-compulsive disorder and delirium or confusional state are also frequent comorbidity in many neurological conditions such as stroke, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson disease (PD). Depression and NDs also have a bidirectional relationship, as not only are patients, for example with stroke at greater risk of developing depression, but patients with depression have a two-fold greater risk of developing a stroke, even after controlling for other risk factors. Dementia or cognitive impairment are part of clinical picture of PD, stroke patients, patients with MS, Huntington disease etc. The prototype of dementia in PD and other NDs is a dysexecutive syndrome with impaired attention, executive functions and secondarily impaired memory. So-called \"functional\" (or psychogenic or hysterical/conversion) symptoms are relatively infrequent in \"neurological\" conditions, but very often unrecognized and not properly treated. Treatment of PSs in neurology, basically are not different then treatment of these symptoms in psychiatry and should be include pharmacotherapy and psychiatry. This presentation gives an overview of frequency and type of PSs underlying necessity to recognize these disorders in every day routine exam and properly treatment.",

These and other movement disorders may also occur as presenting or prominent features of general neurological disorders such as stroke, encephalitis, multiple sclerosis, or CNS tumors. Moreover, they may also occur in the setting of a wide spectrum of systemic diseases, including metabolic and endocrine disorders, intoxications, hematological diseases, cancer, or infection.

Either acute or subacute presentations seem to be pure abnormalities in the coronal plane and are usually reversible. However, a chronic form occurs often in a combined fashion with anteroposterior flexion (camptocormia), improves only partially, remains stable, or even worsens over time. The acute/subacute phenotype is the condition originally named as Pisa syndrome (PS). The pathophysiology of PS remains poorly understood, and a cholinergic-dopaminergic imbalance has been suggested as being involved in the cause of this disorder. The role of other neurotransmitters and how they become dysfunctional in PS remains to be elucidated. Specific treatments, other than discontinuing the medications responsible for the disorder, whenever possible, are undeveloped because of the unknown etiology.",

The physician involved in the care of these patients knows that the disease may present itself also with extramotor symptoms, which condition a more difficult management of the patient. The non-motor symptoms are classified in four categories in order of management importance: 1) disautonomic, 2) cognitive, 3) affective and 4) sensitive. These symptoms are more frequent and difficult to manage in late stage of disease, except for affective type, which may be precox and adaptive at the communication of the diagnosis or sometime precede it. The more frequent disautonomic symptoms are: constipation, symptoms related to the uro-genital sphere, the cardio-pressor regulation (orthostatic hypotension), the thermoregulation, sialorrhea dysphagia and seborrhoea. The cognitive symptoms: isolate (bradyphrenia, alteration of executive function) or dementia with or without delirium and allucinosis. The affective symptoms: depression, agitation, anxiety, panic attacks. The sensitive symptoms: pain, dysesthesia, paresthesia with bizzarre features (cold sensation, numbness, interior agitation). There are other symptoms which are not framing in the previous categories: sleep, respiratory and circulatory disorders (venous and lymphatic), which have different causal factors: emotional-affective, motor and iatrogenic. The therapeutic intervention on these symptoms is of essential importance in the management of the patient with Parkinson's disease, with a great impact on his quality of life.

      "abstract": "A neurological condition of the brain is Parkinson's disease. It causes the body to shake, the hands to shake, and it makes the body stiff. At this advanced level, there is still no viable treatment or cure. Only when treatment is initiated at the earliest stage of the disease is it effective. These could potentially save a life in addition to lowering the cost of the illness. The majority of ways can identify Parkinson's disease after it has advanced, which results in basal ganglia, which regulates movement of the body with a small quantity of dopamine, losing about 60% of their dopamine. The presence of diminutive precursors to chronic diseases, especially neurologically based ailments such as Parkinson’s can indicate and diagnose them in their earliest stages. Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by symptoms such as spasms in the limbs, jaw, and head, rigidity in the limbs and trunk, slow movement, etc. It is important to notice these preliminary symptoms early on to avoid developing Parkinson's disease. This project proposes algorithms used on the dataset to predict PD. Two kinds of datasets are used; one voice dataset and another spiral drawing dataset, and algorithms are used in these datasets to predict the disease and to show the results a user-friendly Web-Application is developed. The algorithms used are K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) on voice dataset implementation and Random Forest on spiral drawing implementation.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Parkinson’s disease is prototypically a movement disorder. Although perceptual and motor functions are highly interdependent, much less is known about perceptual deficits in Parkinson’s disease, which are less observable by nature, and might go unnoticed if not tested directly. It is therefore imperative to seek and identify these, to fully understand the challenges facing patients with Parkinson’s disease. Also, perceptual deficits may be related to motor symptoms. Posture, gait and balance, affected in Parkinson’s disease, rely on veridical perception of one’s own motion (self-motion) in space. Yet it is not known whether self-motion perception is impaired in Parkinson’s disease. Using a well-established multisensory paradigm of heading discrimination (that has not been previously applied to Parkinson’s disease), we tested unisensory visual and vestibular self-motion perception, as well as multisensory integration of visual and vestibular cues, in 19 Parkinson’s disease, 23 healthy age-matched and 20 healthy young-adult participants. After experiencing vestibular (on a motion platform), visual (optic flow) or multisensory (combined visual–vestibular) self-motion stimuli at various headings, participants reported whether their perceived heading was to the right or left of straight ahead. Parkinson’s disease participants and age-matched controls were tested twice (Parkinson’s disease participants on and off medication). Parkinson’s disease participants demonstrated significantly impaired visual self-motion perception compared with age-matched controls on both visits, irrespective of medication status. Young controls performed slightly (but not significantly) better than age-matched controls and significantly better than the Parkinson’s disease group. The visual self-motion perception impairment in Parkinson’s disease correlated significantly with clinical disease severity. By contrast, vestibular performance was unimpaired in Parkinson’s disease. Remarkably, despite impaired visual self-motion perception, Parkinson’s disease participants significantly overweighted the visual cues during multisensory (visual–vestibular ) integration (compared with Bayesian predictions of optimal integration) and significantly more than controls. These findings indicate that self-motion perception in Parkinson’s disease is affected by impaired visual cues and by suboptimal visual–vestibular integration (overweighting of visual cues). Notably, vestibular self-motion perception was unimpaired. Thus, visual self-motion perception is specifically impaired in early-stage Parkinson’s disease. This can impact Parkinson’s disease diagnosis and subtyping. Overweighting of visual cues could reflect a general multisensory integration deficit in Parkinson’s disease, or specific overestimation of visual cue reliability. Finally, impaired self-motion perception in Parkinson’s disease may contribute to impaired balance and gait control. Future investigation into this connection might open up new avenues of alternative therapies to better treat these difficult symptoms.",

Beynin substantia nigra pars kompakta bölgesinde dopamin üreten ve hareketlerin kontrolünden sorumlu olan motor nöronların zaman içerisinde ölmesi sonucu ortaya çıkar. PH teşhisinde kullanılan klasik semtomlar arasında titreme, kaslarda sertlik, hareketlerde yavaşlama ve postural bozukluklar sayılabilir. Tüm bu belirtiler ortaya çıksa bile, iyi bir nörolog dahi hastalık teşhisini yüzde yüz doğrulukta ortaya koyamayabilir çünkü PH çoklu sistem atrofisi ve Lewy cisimli demans gibi diğer bazı nörolojik hastalıklarla karıştılmaktadır. Bunlara ilaveten, hastalığın belirtileri ortaya çıkmadan erken teşhisi şu an için mümkün olmayıp, varlığı motor nöronların %70'den fazlası kaybedildikten ve fiziksel belirtiler ortaya çıktıktan sonra anlaşılmaktadır. Bu nedenle fiziksel belirtiler ortaya çıkmadan, PH'nın erken teşhisinde kullanılabilecek bir biyobelirteç veya biyobelirteç grubunun bulunması oldukça önemlidir. Proteomiks yaklaşımlar biyobelirteç keşfi amaçlı yapılan çalışmalarda sıklıkla kullanılırlar. Proteomiks kısaca hücre veya biyolojik sıvılardaki proteinlerin varlıklarının gösterilmesi, ortam veya biyolojik şartlara bağlı olarak organizmada oluşan değişikliklerin protein seviyesinde incelenmesi diye tarif edilebilir. Genom araştırmaları sonrası çağı olarak da görülen bu alan, hücrede asıl görev yapıcı moleküller olan proteinlerin tanımlanmasından fonksiyonlarına kadar çok geniş bir yelpazede araştırma yapma olanağı sağlamaktadır.

The canonical phenotypeof the Parkinson's disease Dementia (PD-D) or Lewy Body Dementia (LBD) includes deficit of attention, executiveand visuospatial functions, and presents often with apathy, hallucinations, delusions, excessive daytime sleepiness,or sleep disorders. However, the clinical expression may overlap with other neurodegenerative diseases associatedwith cognitive disorders. Thus, while clinicians rely on phenomenological patterns to infer the disease causing thecognitive impairment, the inference is weakened by the heterogeneous clinical expression of the disease. In addition,recent post-mortem studies seem to undermine the supposed pathology-phenotype coherence, making it moreand more unreliable the diagnosis based on symptoms. The lack of coherence between phenotype and pathologymay support the speculation about a common mechanism underlying the progression of the disease. While it is verylikely that a distinct, specific causal event determines the disease itself, the progression might well follow commonpatterns. A number of observations suggest that progressive diseases, which cause cognitive impairment, share aprion-like mechanism. A seeding process is supposed to account for the spreading of the lesion.",

Psychotic disorders in early adulthood are most frequently diagnosed with the schizophrenia spectrum or mood disorders. However, they may be the manifestation of neurologic, endocrine or immunologic disease. Individuals with NDD's such as the autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or intellectual developmental disorder (IDD) may also present initially in adulthood. Therefore it is not uncommon that the psychiatrist is the first physician to assess a psychotic patient with underlying medical illness or a NDD. Failure to identify the underlying cause will delay appropriate management. Overdiagnosis of primary psychiatric disorders may be misleading in planning the treatment, as evidence-based treatment algorithms relevant to psychosis are intended for primary psychotic disorders like schizophrenia, and symptomatic treatment may result in unnecessary exposure to antipsychotic drugs. Exclusion of other medical conditions and NDD's is essential before establishing a diagnosis of schizophrenia.",

Among them, depression and anxiety complicate PD and are present at high rates in PD patients. Organic depression is generally known to affect a patient's recovery from the sequelae of the primary disease; thus early detection and appropriate treatment are essential. Depression in PD is thought to result from different factors such as disappearance of neurons in the dopamine, noradrenaline, and serotonin as well as from psychogenic reactions associated with the onset of the disease. Moreover, anxiety may also be a side effect of PD treatment. As morbid states of depression and anxiety are complicated, these symptoms are often difficult to diagnose. Moreover, the validity of these diagnostic methods has not been established. Therefore, accurate diagnoses of morbid states in the early stage of the disease and corresponding appropriate treatments are vital.",

      "title": "When does Parkinson's disease begin?",
      "abstract": "Abstract Pathological and neuroimaging studies have shown that in Parkinson's disease (PD) there is a “subclinical” or “premotor” period during which dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN) degenerate but typical motor symptoms have not yet developed. Post‐mortem studies based on nigral cell counts and evaluating dopamine levels in the striata, and imaging studies assessing the nigrostriatal pathway in vivo, have estimated that this time period could last 3 to 6 years. In addition, emerging evidence indicates that the neuropathological process of PD does not start in the SN but more likely elsewhere in the nervous system: in the lower brainstem and the olfactory bulb, or even more distant from the SN, such as in the peripheral autonomic nervous system. Patients with PD frequently can present non‐motor symptoms, such as hyposmia or constipation, years before the development of classical motor signs. The physiopathology of these “premotor” symptoms, though still unclear, is currently thought to be related to early involvement by the pathological process underlying PD of non‐dopaminergic lower brainstem structures or autonomic plexuses. However, the answer to the question “when does PD start” remains uncertain. Here, we review clinical, pathological, and neuroimaging data related to the onset of the pathological process of PD, and propose that its onset is non‐motor and that non‐motor symptoms could begin in many instances 10 and 20 years before onset of motor symptoms. The variable course of the disorder once the motor symptoms develop, suggests that the start and progression of premotor PD is also highly variable andgiven the heterogeneous nature of PD, may differ depending on the cause/s of the syndrome. When and where the neuropathological process develops in PD remains uncertain. © 2009 Movement Disorder Society",

      "abstract": "Sleep quality is one of the major sources of dissatisfaction among patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Insomnia, parasomnia and daytime sleep disorders are all common. The motor problems accompanying PD are well studied and documented, yet little is known about sleep and the other non-motor problems. Dopaminergic medications, the neurochemical and neurodegenerative changes may all contribute to the pathogenesis of sleep disorders in PD. Subjective or objective sleepiness assessment should routinely be performed by physicians looking after PD patients. Patients should be informed of the risks associated with excessive daytime sleepiness. Management is difficult and should be targeted to the specific sleep disorder and its likely cause. Simple sleep measures such as sleep hygiene should be tried first before pharmacological treatment is initiated.",

      "title": "Exploring the connection between sleep disorders and neurological diseases: implications for diagnosis and management",
      "abstract": "Sleep is a vital and complex physiological process which is critical to maintain normal functioning of the nervous system1. Research suggests that lack of sleep or sleep disorders increase the risk of several health issues including hypertension, cardiovascular disorders, diabetes, depression, and obesity1. In this article, we aim to discover the relationship between sleep disorders and neurological diseases and its implications for diagnosis and management. Sleep disorders have been shown to have an impact on several neurological diseases. Poor sleep can increase the risk of Alzheimer disease (AD), Parkinson disease (PD), multiple sclerosis, and Huntington disease2. Moreover, sleep disorders have also been shown to have an impact on increasing the risk of stroke, epilepsy, and affecting cognitive function such as learning and memory. Furthermore, autism spectrum disorder and neuropathic pain have also shown to have an association with sleep disorders2. Just like sleep disorders have a negative impact on the nervous system, some neurological diseases can affect the sleeping patterns of an individual. A few central nervous system conditions have been shown to cause sleep apnea which results in a disturbed circadian rhythm resulting in difficulty sleeping at night. Over 50% of patients with a history of stroke have reported of sleeping problems. Moreover, AD and PD have also been shown to have an association with poor sleep3. Establishing a robust diagnosis of sleep disorders in patients with neurological diseases can prove to be challenging due to overlap in symptoms which may lead to misdiagnosis. The current gold standard test for diagnosing sleeping disorders is polysomnography4. Other tests include: lab testing to screen for stimulants or other medications which may increase the level of alertness and disturb sleep; Multiple Sleep Latency Test to determine the degree of sleepiness; Maintenance of Wakefulness Test to test for the ability of staying awake; and actigraphy which includes the use of a device worn on the writs which provides data regarding periods of rest and/or sleep activities5. Even though these tests are accurate per se, there are always certain limitations. In order to understand the complex relationship between neurological diseases and sleep disorders, there is a need for emerging diagnostic technologies to improve accuracy which is critical for providing an early intervention and improving patient outcomes. Treating sleep disorders among patients with underlying neurological disorders can also be arduous, given the complex nature of the relationship between the two. Therapies targeted toward treating sleep disorders include light therapy, orofacial therapy, and cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBT-I). In addition, medical management includes the use of medications such as benzodiazepines (eg, zolpidem, zaleplon, and eszopiclone), melatonin receptor agonists (eg, ramelteon), and orexin receptor antagonists (eg, suvorexant)6. Furthermore, continuous positive airway pressure has shown promising results in improving sleep among patients suffering from obstructive sleep apnea7. Although the discussed managements and treatments are excellent for treating sleep disorders, there still remains a lack of literature in the management and treatment for sleeping disorders among those with underlying neurological disorders. Thus, there is a need for more targeted therapies which take account of the underlying mechanisms of sleep disorders and neurological diseases. Collaboration between neurologists and sleep specialists is crucial to enhance the identification and early intervention of sleep disorder and neurological diseases. It is also imperative for primary care physicians to have a strong understanding of sleep abnormalities in patients with neurological conditions. These physicians can screen patients for sleep disorders and refer them so specialists for further evaluation and treatment, which will provide appropriate care to the patients and improve outcomes. Moreover, educating the patients regarding importance of sleep and their beneficial effects on neurological health is essential. The combined effort of patients and their health care professionals will provide a more comprehensive care for those suffering with neurological diseases and sleep disorders. To conclude, sleep is crucial for optimal functioning of the nervous system and research has shown that sleep disorders increase the likelihood of several health issues. The relationship between sleep disorders and neurological disorders in complex making appropriate diagnosis and treatment challenging. Poor sleep has been linked to various neurological diseases including AD, PD, multiple sclerosis, and Huntington disease. Establishing an accurate diagnosis of sleep disorders in patients with neurological disease is necessary for early intervention and improved outcomes. Moreover, targeted therapies that consider the underlying disease mechanisms of sleep disorders and neurological are needed to improve management and treatment of these patients. Collaboration between neurologists, sleep specialists, and primary care physicians is necessary for better identifications and treatment of sleep disorders in patients with underlying neurological conditions. Lastly, educating the patients regarding the importance of sleep and encouraging a combined effort between patients and health care providers will provide a more comprehensive care for those with neurological diseases and sleep disorders.

      "title": "Sleep disturbances in patients with Parkinson’s disease: It’s time to wake up!",
      "abstract": "Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) develop a range of non-motor symptoms (NMS). Sleep disturbance is one of the common NMS of PD and the onset of sleep disorders often precede the onset of motor symptoms of PD. Motor symptoms of PD often receive the main clinical focus and the sleep disturbances often go unnoticed in clinical practice. Given that the prevalence of PD is higher in the elderly population, primary care physicians, geriatricians, and gerontologists are usually the first point of contact for a majority of patients with PD. Because of this, it is important that they have a clear understanding about the diagnosis and management of the sleep disturbances in PD. This review provides an overview of the full spectrum of sleep disturbances in PD that includes insomnia, excessive daytime sleepiness, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, restless leg syndrome, periodic limb movements, and obstructive sleep apnea. Although these sleep disorders may be primarily associated with PD, it is crucial to delineate the other treatable causes of sleep disturbances such as side effects of medications and physical symptoms not related to PD. This review highlights the major sleep disorders observed in patients with PD and succinctly discusses their management aspects. In addition, we have briefly described the effect of deep brain stimulation on the natural course of several sleep disorders in PD in this article.",

      "title": "Chronic Pain, Psychopathology, and DSM-5 Somatic Symptom Disorder",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor:\r\n\r\nThe neurophysiological mechanisms and comorbidities of anxiety and depression with chronic pain cited by the authors1 serve as evidence of correlation, not causality. When A (neurophysiological mechanism) and B (symptom of chronic pain) occur together, it cannot be concluded that A causes B, because it could just as well be that B causes A, or a third factor causes both. Regarding the comorbidity of chronic pain with anxiety or depression, it could be that these forms of psychological distress result from chronic pain due to physical impairment, that the pain is a symptomatic expression of anxiety or depression, or that underlying psychosocial issues are causing both. A mentor of mine used to say, “You can’t have a bad thought without a bad molecule, and you don’t know which comes first,” and this paper proves that adage.\r\n\r\nWhen a symptom or condition is diagnosed as psychosomatic, this should not be done solely by exclusion, that is, lack of objective medical evidence. There should be positive substantiation through identification of psychological factors that provide an understanding of what is going on in the life of the patient. The ability to at least ballpark such situations should be in the therapeutic armamentarium of every physician, while psychiatrists should be able to provide biopsychosocial formulations as a core skill. By doing so, we help our patients by empowering them to deal with real life problems, as opposed to placing them in a position of passivity as recipients of a medical solution. Problems occur when psychosomatic diagnoses are communicated poorly, such as “There’s nothing really wrong with you” or “It’s all in your head,” and when patients are not ready to assume psychological ownership of personal problems. Either of these can result in demonization of physicians who make such diagnoses, in the former case justifiably, not so the latter.\r\n\r\nCase in point: the diagnosis of tension headaches seems to have disappeared from the medical lexicon, because everyone has migraines. Despite their potential severity, tension headaches are not seen as medical enough, place an onus on patients to deal with whatever source of tension is causing the headaches, and places physicians who make this diagnosis at risk of demonization for allegedly blaming patients and minimizing their suffering. By contrast, the diagnosis of migraine is perceived as more validating and more supportive, leading to a proliferation of migraine diagnoses and treatments.\r\n\r\nJust as the failure to make a medical diagnosis can have serious consequences in patients with chronic pain and other medically unexplained symptoms, so, too, can the neglect of a psychosomatic diagnosis, in terms of extensive and fruitless investigations and consultations, iatrogenic complications of questionable treatments, and reinforcement of illness–disabled role issues at the expense of dealing with real problems. The mind is more than the sum of the neurochemical parts of the brain, and the failure to recognize this places us at risk of falling into a mindless brand of psychiatry.2",

      "abstract": "Parkinson’s diseases, occuring most often between the ages of 50 and 60 years, on average at the age 58 years is a progressive degenerative disease of the central nervous system of global importance and serious consequences for public health. Its main symptoms are tremor at rest muscle stiffness and bradykinesia, i.e. slowness of movement (the so-called parkinsonian triad). Atrophic lessons of substantia nigra, located in the midbrain, responsible for the production of dopamine, contribute to the onset of symptoms of the disease. Patients with Parkinson’s diseases suffer from a variety of extra-motor symptoms often psychiatric disorders, especially panic or generalized anxiety. The author presents the case of 63 years old man diagnosed with Parkinson’s diseases 4 years ago, with quite a significant severity in the last 2 years. Left limb weakness (upper and lower) deepened and general slowing of movement developed then restless legs syndrome developed fully (specific sensations in the area of the feet and lower legs in the evening and night hours, temporarily decreasing when moving, walking, stretching the muscles). For about 6 months he have had attacks of anxiety and anxiety as well as a fully developed generalized anxiety disorder. The combination of levodopa and carbidopa and pregabalin was used, resulting in a reduction of slowness and stiffness as well as a significant reduction in anxiety and anxiety after approximately 8 weeks.",

La prevalen-cia puntual de la demencia asociada a la enfermedad se estima en alrededor del 25-30 °% con un incremento proporcional en relación con la edad y el tiempo de evolución de la enfermedad. El perfil clínico puede ser heterogéneo y hace referencia a la alteración en los diferentes dominios que supone un substrato neurobiológico diferente.

La valoración rutinaria de las actividades de la vida diaria y el desempeño funcional se ha relacionado con el grado de compromiso así como con el rendimiento cognitivo global. Pacientes en estadios avanzados y candidatos a la cirugía de estimulación cerebral profunda requieren la evaluación neuropsicológica para seguimiento e identificación de potenciales riesgos o contraindicaciones cognitivas, comportamentales y/o emocionales.

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative condition that gradually impairs both motor function and cognitive abilities. This decline stems from by the deterioration of cells responsible for producing dopamine in the brain. Parkinson's disease can occur in individuals across diverse age brackets, with a higher incidence in those aged 60 and older. Yet, it should be emphasized that Parkinson's can also impact individuals at a younger age, often in their 40s or 50s, termed \"early-onset\" Parkinson's disease. In rarer cases, Parkinson's has even been identified in much younger individuals. There are two kinds of symptoms in PD (motor and non-motor symptoms). In motor-symptoms it's having (tremors, rigidity, bradykinesia, postural instability, freezing), and in non-motor symptoms it's having (cognitive changes, mood disorders, sleep disorders, automatic dysfunction, sensory issues, fatigue, constipation, sexual dysfunction). However, many feature extraction methods face challenges with low performance accuracy, which is unacceptable when dealing with the detection of a chronic condition of this disease. Diverse approaches within machine learning, encompassing decision trees, logistic regression, SVM, and KNN, were used to determine which individuals with Parkinson's disease and which ones were healthy controls. It's interesting to note that baseline models, such as the frequency domain method, performed comparably, indicating that they would be a good choice for PD diagnosis.",

      "abstract": "˝Parkinson plus˝ syndrome designates a group of neurodegenerative diseases which present with parkinsonian features (bradykinesia, tremor, rigidity, postural instability), but can be differentiated from Parkinson's disease by certain clinical features. In the recent literature these diseases are also called atypical parkinsonism. Considering their histopathological substrate they can be divided into α-synucleinopathies and tauopathies. α-synucleinopathies include multiple system atrophy and dementia with Lewy bodies. They are characterized by accumulation of α-synuclein in oligodendrocytes and neurons. Multiple system atrophy presents with autonomic dysfunction, parkinsonism, or cerebellar syndrome. Dementia with Lewy bodies is the second most common dementia after Alzheimer's disease and it is challenging to differentiate it from Parkinson's disease dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Tauopathies include progressive supranuclear palsy, frontotemporal lobar degeneration and corticobasal degeneration, all having in common the accumulation of tau protein, which then forms the insoluble neurofibrillary or gliofibrillary tangles. It is important to notice that frontotemporal lobar degeneration can be associated with accumulation of other proteins different from tau. Regarding the brain regions affected by pathological processes, a variety of complex clinical presentations are seen. Progressive supranuclear palsy presents with axial parkinsonism, supranuclear gaze palsy and postural instability associated with falls. Frontotemporal lobar degeneration presents as a behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia and primary progressive aphasia. Corticobasal degeneration presents with progressive, asymmetric parkinsonism with poor response to levodopa, dystonia, myoclonus, and signs of cortical affection. The precise pathophysiological cause of these changes is still unknown and it is expected that with the understanding of these processes a new potential etiologic therapy will emerge.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a long-term neurodegenerative disease characterized by the presence of dopaminergic neuronal loss and dysfunction in the substantia nigra. Motor disturbance is the symptom most typically reported, including bradykinesia plus either limb rigidity, resting tremor, or postural instability [1–3]. Importantly, it has been reported that at the point when the patient meets criteria for the principal of motor disturbance, approximately 60% of substantia nigra neurons are lost [4]. Non-motor symptoms have also been observed in both PD patients as well as in related animal models, including pain, autonomic dysfunction, depression, anxiety, olfactory dysfunction, cognitive impairment and sleep disorders [5,6]. The presence and severity of these non-motor symptoms as the disease progresses exacerbate the degree of disability of PD patients. These non-motor symptoms suggest that neurodegenerative processes in PD extends beyond the substantia nigra and dopaminergic deficit [6–10]. It has been noted that before PD becomes clinically significant, neurodegeneration has been ongoing for some time. This has led to the notion of a “pre-motor” phase [11], during which non-motor manifestations and a variety of other abnormalities may offer key biomarkers of the disease process.",

      "title": "Neurologic erectile dysfunction",
      "abstract": "Because erection is a neurovascular event, any disease or dysfunction affecting the brain, spinal cord, cavernosus and pudendal nerves, or receptors in the terminal arterioles and cavernosus muscles can induce erectile dysfunction (ED). The medial preoptic area with the paraventricular nucleus has been regarded as an important integration centre for sexual drive and penile erection in animal studies []. Pathological processes affecting these regions, such as Parkinson's disease or stroke, are often associated with ED. Parkinsonism's effect may be caused by the imbalance of dopaminergic pathways. In patients with spinal cord injury, the degree of erectile function that persists depends largely on the nature, location and extent of the spinal lesion. Other disorders at the spinal level (e.g., spina bifida, disc herniation, syringomyelia, tumor and multiple sclerosis) may affect the afferent and efferent neural pathways in a similar manner.",

      "abstract": "ATYPICAL PARKINSONIAN SYNDROMES Idiopathic Parkinson's disease is the most common cause of parkinsonism, but in almost 40 % of cases, parkinsonism is due to other causes. The diagnosis of atypical parkinsonian syndromes remains difficult at the early stage. Parkinson's syndrome is associated with other symptoms called «red flags». These red flags need to be identified during the clinical examination. Unlike Parkinson's disease, dopaminergic treatment are slightly effective on motor symptoms. The prognosis is worst, with a faster progression. The life expectation is reduced compared to Parkinson's disease. Diagnosis certainty, given by anatomopathology, is not available during the patient's lifetime. Advances in functional imaging improve diagnosis accuracy. Clinical course answers diagnosis uncertainties in a few month or years. The follow up is multidisciplinary. No treatment is currently available.SYNDROMES PARKINSONIENS ATYPIQUES Dans près de 40 % des cas, la présence d’un syndrome parkinsonien n’est pas dûe à une maladie de Parkinson idiopathique (MPI). Les syndromes parkinsoniens atypiques font partie des diagnostics différentiels à envisager. Le syndrome parkinsonien est alors associé à d’autres symptômes appelés « drapeaux rouges », qui doivent être recherchés à l’interrogatoire et à l’examen physique. Il s’agit de maladies neurodégénératives de moins bon pronostic que la MPI : la progression des signes est plus rapide et la durée de survie diminuée. Contrairement à la maladie de Parkinson, les signes moteurs répondent peu ou pas au traitement dopaminergique. Le diagnostic des syndromes parkinsoniens atypiques est difficile au stade précoce. La certitude diagnostique, obtenue par l’anatomopathologie, n’est pas disponible du vivant du patient. Les progrès de l’imagerie fonctionnelle nous apportent une aide précieuse, et l’évolution clinique permet souvent de répondre à la question diagnostique en quelques mois ou années. La prise en charge est multidisciplinaire. Il n’existe pas de traitement curatif aujourd’hui.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurobehavioral disorder defined clinically by its motor features. Pathologically, it is defined by the loss of pigmented neurons in the brain stem, coupled with the presence of Lewy bodies in those degenerating centers. However, advances in histology have led to the recognition of pathological changes in regions far more widespread than recognized even a decade ago, and there is every reason to believe that more surprises are in store in the near future. The correlations between pathology and clinical phenomena have yet to be made for most brain regions, leaving our understanding of the mechanisms of the clinical features of the disease incomplete. The behavioral and nonmotor aspects of PD are particularly difficult to understand because of the major overlap among problems due to neuronal degeneration, psychological responses to progressive disability, iatrogenic complications, and the secondary effects of primary disorders, such as excessive daytime somnolence due to sleep disorder.",

More than 6 million people world­wide suffer from Parkinson’s disease. The diagnosis of the di­sease is based on history, heteroanamnesis and clinical exa­mi­na­tion.

It is very important to recognise patients’ sexual dysfunctions early for an appropriate and effective management of their per­so­nal and couple life. The family doctor knows the patient and can detect early prodromal symptoms and also observe the impact that the disease may have on the partner of the Parkinson’s disease patient with sexual dy­na­mics disorders.

Należą one do grupy objawów pozaruchowych. Uwzględnienie ich w całościowym, interdyscyplinarnym procesie diagnostyczno-terapeutycznym zwiększa szanse na optymalne fizyczne, psychiczne, poznawcze oraz społeczne funkcjonowanie chorych i zachowanie przez nich ogólnej dobrej jakości życia. Choć zburzenia neuropsychiatryczne i funkcji poznawczych mogą być bardziej uciążliwe dla chorych niż zaburzenia ruchowe, to często są one pomijane w procesie diagnostycznym i leczeniu. Ich współwystępowanie obniża efektywność leczenia podstawowego, przyspieszając proces deterioracji fizycznej i poznawczej, i prowadząc do większej niepełnosprawności i śmier telności. Profil objawów neuropsychologicznych w PD jest specyficzny, odmienny niż w innych chorobach neurozwyrodnieniowych (np. chorobie Alzheimera), i obejmuje zaburzenia w zakresie pięciu podstawowych obszarów poznawczych, tj.: funkcji wykonawczych z bradyfrenią, pamięci, sprawności wzrokowo-przestrzennej, procesów uwagi, sprawności językowej. W momencie rozpoznania łagodne zaburzenia poznawcze występują u 30% chorych, po 3 latach — u 50%, natomiast po kilkunastu latach u 80–90% pacjentów z PD rozpoznaje się otępienie. W populacji ogólnej osób w wieku powyżej 65 lat rozpowszechnienie otępienia w przebiegu PD wynosi 2–4%. Wzrastająca długość życia chorych oraz potr zeba podnoszenia jakości życia pacjentów z chorobami neurozwyro dnieniowymi skłaniają do poszukiwania bardziej efektywnych metod wczesnej diagnostyki i wielostronnego leczenia, z uwzględnieniem oddziaływań farmakologicznych i niefarmakologicznych.",

How the cognition progress to dementia is a key to be explored. The cognitive impairment shows two profiles: cortical (memory encoding, visuospatial abilities, and language) and subcortical, with a dysexecutive syndrome that includes deficits in recognition memory, attention processes, and visual perception as well as visual hallucinations and cognitive fluctuations. Behavioral problems such as apathy, anxiety, depression, and impulse control disorders take a significant part in the loss of autonomy and progression of the disease. To detect the risk of Parkinson’s disease dementia development, the integral evaluation of patients in all stages of the disease should consider the interplay of genetic and epigenetic factors, motor subtypes, and non-motor symptoms (NMS) in order to implement different therapeutics and supportive strategies when they are likely to have efficacy.",

      "title": "Alteraciones cognitivas y lingüísticas en la enfermedad de Parkison",
      "abstract": "La Enfermedad de Parkinson (EP) es una enfermedad neurodegenerativa caracterizada principalmente por sintomas motores (rigidez, bradicinesia, temblor en reposo) que aparece por una perdida de dopamina en el circuito que conecta los ganglios basales con la corteza cerebral y por la aparicion de depositos de Lewy en diferentes regiones cerebrales. Aunque el origen de la EP es parcialmente desconocido, han sido descubiertos algunos genes que estan involucrados en su aparicion, pero que explican solamente un pequeno porcentaje de los casos. En las ultimas decadas, el interes por los sintomas no motores (SNM) de la enfermedad ha ido creciendo progresivamente. El deterioro cognitivo leve (DCL) es uno de estos sintomas que puede aparecer incluso desde los inicios de la enfermedad y en algunos casos, evolucionar hasta la demencia. El perfil cognitivo de estos pacientes suele caracterizarse por dificultades ejecutivas, aunque tambien es frecuente encontrar deficits de memoria, de habilidades visuoespaciales, de procesamiento emocional y del lenguaje.En el caso del lenguaje, las alteraciones pueden afectar tanto al procesamiento de mas alto nivel como la pragmatica o la comprension de oraciones, hasta el procesamiento lexico-semantico. Sin embargo, aun hay controversia acerca del origen de estos deficits. Diferentes estudios han tratado de conocer si el deficit es puramente linguistico o si por el contrario es secundario a las alteraciones cognitivas presentes en los pacientes, o incluso si existe relacion con el trastorno motor y/o los niveles de dopamina cerebral.El objetivo principal de esta Tesis es conocer el perfil cognitivo de un grupo de pacientes con EP sin demencia asi como las alteraciones linguisticas que pueden presentar, principalmente de los verbos.La hipotesis de partida es que los pacientes con EP muestran deficits cognitivos y en el reconocimiento de expresiones faciales en ausencia de demencia objetivados con pruebas neuropsicologicas. En cuanto a los trastornos del lenguaje, la hipotesis principal de este trabajo es que los pacientes con EP sin demencia presentan deficits linguisticos en el procesamiento de los verbos que aumentan con la retirada de la medicacion dopaminergica. Para poner a prueba estas hipotesis, llevamos a cabo 5 estudios distintos. En el primer trabajo participaron 50 pacientes con EP y 42 controles sanos. En el segundo, 40 pacientes con EP y 19 controles, en ambos, los pacientes fueron evaluados con una extensa bateria neuropsicologica y en el segundo se incluyeron mas tareas linguisticas y una de reconocimiento de expresiones faciales. En el tercer estudio, una muestra de 49 pacientes con EP y 19 controles realizaron una tarea de denominacion de acciones en la que se controlo el contenido motor de los dibujos que tenian que denominar. En los experimentos cuatro y cinco, 20 pacientes fueron evaluados con la misma tarea de denominacion de acciones (estudio cuatro) y con cuatro tareas de fluidez verbal (estudio cinco), mientras estaban con y sin los efectos de la medicacion dopaminergica.Los resultados encontrados han sido publicados en cinco articulos y pueden resumirse de la siguiente manera:En el primer articulo (Rodriguez-Ferreiro, Cuetos, Herrera, Menendez & Ribacoba, 2010) se encontro que la muestra con EP sin demencia presentaba dificultades en tareas que evaluaban funciones ejecutivas, atencion, orientacion temporal, memoria inmediata, fluidez semantica, denominacion de personajes famosos y denominacion de acciones. En el segundo articulo (Herrera, Cuetos & Rodriguez-Ferreiro, 2011), encontramos diferencias significativas en la fluidez semantica, la fluidez de acciones, la denominacion de acciones, la denominacion de personajes famosos, la atencion y el reconocimiento de expresiones faciales. Los analisis de regresion mostraron que la tarea de reconocimiento de expresiones era la que mejor diferenciaba entre el grupo de EP y el grupo control. Ademas la distribucion de este deficit era similar tanto para los pacientes con DCL como para los pacientes con funciones cognitivas normales. Centrandonos en las alteraciones del lenguaje, en el tercer articulo (Herrera, Rodriguez-Ferreiro & Cuetos, 2012) se observo que los pacientes cometen mas errores a la hora de denominar dibujos que tienen un alto contenido motor en comparacion con aquellos de bajo contenido motor, mientras que los controles tenian un rendimiento similar en ambas categorias. Los resultados del cuarto articulo con pacientes con y sin medicacion (Herrera & Cuetos, 2012), mostraron que mientras en los pacientes con medicacion, los tiempos de reaccion (TR) eran similares para ambos tipos de dibujos, en los EP off, los TR eran significativamente mas lentos para los dibujos con un alto contenido motor. Por ultimo, los resultados obtenidos en el quinto estudio (Herrera, Cuetos & Ribacoba, 2012) muestran que los pacientes off medicacion generan significativamente menos palabras en las tareas que dependen de las zonas frontales (fluidez fonologica y de acciones). Y lo mas interesante es que en el caso de la fluidez de acciones, los pacientes off medicacion generaron verbos significativamente mas frecuentes que en on o que los generados por el grupo control.Los resultados sugieren que es posible encontrar deficits cognitivos en pacientes con EP sin demencia o quejas subjetivas de deterioro en los estadios iniciales de la enfermedad. Ademas estas dificultades no solo se relacionan con las tareas ejecutivas, sino que tambien aparecen problemas semanticos. Aparte de los deficits cognitivos, es posible encontrar problemas relacionados con el reconocimiento de expresiones faciales, independientes a la presencia de DCL.En cuanto a los trastornos linguisticos, los EP muestran un deficit especifico en el procesamiento de los verbos evaluado tanto con tareas de denominacion de acciones como de fluidez verbal. En el caso de la denominacion de acciones, el deficit parece tener un origen semantico, pues las dificultades aumentan al denominar acciones con mayor contenido motor que es mas acusado en los pacientes en los que el trastorno motor es mas severo (cuando estan sin medicacion). Estos datos sugieren que las mismas areas encargadas de planificar y ejecutar los movimientos estan implicadas, al menos en parte, en el procesamiento de los verbos de accion. Ademas la dopamina tambien parece jugar un papel importante en la activacion del sistema lexico-semantico de los verbos, pues cuando los pacientes se encuentran sin los efectos de la medicacion, solo pueden acceder a aquellos verbos que tienen mayor frecuencia lexica y por tanto estan mas accesibles.En definitiva, los resultados presentados muestran que los pacientes con EP sin demencia, presentan deficits cognitivos, de reconocimiento de expresiones faciales y dificultades relacionadas con el procesamiento de los verbos.",

      "abstract": "The classic Parkinson disease diagnosis triad are resting tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia. Postural stability and falls are often a late complication of the disorder. The natural history of the disorder stems from an unexplained loss of neurons, and the largest risk factor appears to be age. Literature regarding neuroprotective agents and medications that may help \"slow down\" the disease progression have been widely published. Once the diagnosis is made, in some cases, months to years may have passed before effective therapy is begun. With the advent of levodopa in the late 1960s and early 1970s, the gold standard for therapy of Parkinson disease has remained carbidopa/levodopa. As a result of the treatment, long-term complications of the motor symptoms were reported for the therapy aimed at helping those motor symptoms. Today the prognosis of patients with the diagnosis is excellent. Patients get relief from motor complaints but continue to suffer from non-motor complications.",

      "title": "Depression: A Primary Symptom of Parkinson Disease?",
      "abstract": "Depression: A Primary Symptom of Parkinson Disease? One of the most common neurological conditions present in geriatric clients who seek rehabilitation services is Parkinson disease. While there appears to be good agreement on the nature of its primary physical symptomatology -- i.e., tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia -- this is not the case for its primary psychological symptomatology (Dakof & Mendelsohn, 1986). There is considerable disagreement about whether chronic depression occurs frequently enough to be considered a primary symptom of the disease, and if it does, whether its cause is mainly biochemical or psychosocial. A high incidence of chronic depression among persons who have this disease -- regardless of whether its etiology were physiological or psychological--obviously would impact upon the activities of those responsible for planning and assessing rehabilitation services for such persons. Traditionally, depression had been regarded as being as much a primary symptom of Parkinson disease as tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia (Dakof and Mendelsohn, 1986; Gotham, Brown, and Marsden, 1986; Horn, 1974; Robins, 1976; Santamaria, Tolosa, and Valles, 1986). This may have been due, in part, to the fact that persons who are depressed and those who have Parkinson disease tend to share the following symptoms: slowness in movement, stooped posture, blank facial expression, sleep disturbances, and slowness in cognitive functioning. The findings of several recent studies suggest that chronic depression is not a primary symptom of Parkinson disease--i.e., they suggest that the majority of persons who have the disease are not chronically depressed (Dakof and Mendelsohn, 1986; Santamaria, Tolosa, and Valles, 1986). A study is reported in this paper the findings of which are consistent with this conclusion. Method Fifty-two persons who had Parkinson disease, who were members of the Wisconsin Parkinson Association, completed a semantic differential task (Osgood, Suci, & Tannenbaum, 1957). The majority of the participants were male (70 percent) and married (81 percent). The participants ranged in age from 45 to 83 years (mean - 68 years) and the mean length of time they had had Parkinson disease was eight years (range 2 to 25 years). The majority (65 percent) of them were retired. Participants were instructed to rate themselves on each of 81 seven-point, bipolar adjectival scales with regard to how well the adjectives that defined the scale described them. The semantic differential used (Silverman, 1985, pp. 258-259) was designed for eliciting stereotypes of persons who had communicative disorders. We decided to use this semantic differential because it included a depressed/happy scale, and since it contained so many scales, participants would be unlikely to infer the purpose of our study (i.e., to determine whether the majority of persons with Parkinson disease are depressed) from examining it. Each scale was presented in this form: depressed - - - - - happy. The semantic differential task was administered using a standard set of instructions (Silverman, 1985, pp. 256-257). Results Three percentages were computed for each scale: the percentage of participants whose ratings were at one of the two poles (i.e., the percentage who placed a mark on one of the three lines at the right or left side of the scale) and the percentage of participants whose ratings were at the center of the scale. The majority of the participants did not judge themselves to be depressed. Only nine of the 52 (17 percent) revealed by their ratings on the depressed/happy scale that they were depressed: A chi square test (Siegel, 1956) indicated that the probability of this outcome being due to chance is less than 0.01. These data suggest that chronic depression is not experienced by the majority of persons with Parkinson disease who are similar to our subjects and, hence, it is not a primary symptom of Parkinson disease for such persons. …",

      "abstract": "La maladie de Parkinson a longtemps été considérée comme un trouble neurodégénératif d’expression motrice pure. Il est à ce jour établi que la triade symptomatique hypertonie extrapyramidale-tremblement- akinésie ne peut résumer la complexité du trouble. Pouvant inaugurer la maladie ou survenir plus tardivement, les symptômes non moteurs, qu’ils soient cognitifs ou psychiatriques, ont un retentissement majeur sur l’autonomie fonctionnelle et la qualité de vie des patients [1]. Les troubles psychiatriques comorbides à la maladie de Parkinson, par leur fréquence et leur impact, nécessitent un repérage et une prise en charge spécifiques et précoces, s’inscrivant dans une approche holistique centrée sur le patient. En effet, la dépression est souvent sous-évaluée et de fait sous-traitée chez le sujet souffrant de maladie de Parkinson. Parmi les autres symptômes pouvant compliquer la prise en charge de ces patients, les manifestations liées au syndrome de dérégulation dopaminergique peuvent également relever d’une prise en charge psychiatrique adaptée [2]. Quant aux hallucinations visuelles, elles sont fréquentes et constituent un marqueur d’évolution, signant parfois l’entrée dans un processus démentiel ou dans ce que l’on qualifie de « psychose » parkinsonienne [3]. Dans un tel contexte, cette session thématique se propose de présenter un état des connaissances sur les spécificités et les conséquences des troubles psychiatriques associés à la maladie de Parkinson et de préciser les stratégies de dépistage et de prise en charge spécifiques.",

Some NMS may antedate the diagnosis of PD. Examples of NMS include cognitive impairment, autonomic dysfunction, visual dysfunction, sleep abnormalities, and psychiatric disorders. NMS are associated with wide-ranging abnormalities in extranigral dopaminergic systems and non-dopaminergic (e.g. cholinergic, noradrenergic, serotoninergic) systems. The type and severity of NMS vary based on age, disease severity, and predominant motor symptoms. NMS can be disabling and reduce quality of life. Treatment of NMS can be challenging. Some NMS are helped by dopaminergic treatment, whereas others can be induced or exacerbated by treatments that help the motor dysfunction. Physicians should probe their PD patients about their NMS and address them for better care. Clinical trials should incorporate NMS as outcomes for more meaningful conclusions on the effect of treatments under investigation.",

      "abstract": "Machine learning is set of methods which can detect pattern in data, create new pattern, and can estimate future data. There are mainly two types of machine learning supervised and unsupervised. Neural network is technique of machine learning which is used for perposed work. As we have seen that nowadays many neurological disorder problems found in every age group. From these neurological disorders Parkinson disease is gradually increasing in older people. It has generally seen after the age of 50. Symptoms of Parkinson disease seems similar to other neurological disorders at the first time, thats why sometime it is difficult to differentiate it from other neurological disorders. This disease reduce the quantity of dopamine in the substantia nigra,in the part of brain. Dopamine helps to carry signals from brain to all parts of body. When degree of dopamine decreases in brain body movements becomes slow. Its symptoms are generally muscle stiffness, shaking, lower balance of body, and voice distortion. We choose the voice distortion for our research because if person is affected with PD it can be easily identified from its vocal speech. Parkinson disease patient’s voice would be harsh,rigid and sometimes he cannot pronounce words properly. There are many diagnosis system have been developed for Parkinson disease but these systems can only classify it into two stages healthy or unhealthy. So we have tried to classify it into more then two stages so that diagnosis can be more easy. We classify it into 7 stages which shows the degree of harming from his speech signals. We use ANN based stage classifier, we calculate the features then perform pre-processing then classify it. Our result for this research work is shows 88.9% accuracy in true classification of data in seven different stages of the disease.",

A medida que la enfermedad de Parkinson progresa, sus manifestaciones no motoras se van haciendo cada vez mas evidentes, hasta el punto de que, en fases avanzadas, llegan a dominar el cuadro clinico. El abanico de sintomas no motores de la enfermedad de Parkinson es muy amplio. Las alteraciones de la funcion urinaria y de la funcion sexual (entendida como capacidad para llevar a cabo la funcion sexual) pueden enmarcarse dentro de los trastornos disautonomicos. La hipersexualidad se englobaria en el grupo de trastornos del control de impulsos. Desarrollo. Se revisa la epidemiologia, fenomenologia y tratamiento de los trastornos urinarios, la disfuncion sexual y la hipersexualidad como sintomas no motores de la enfermedad de Parkinson. Conclusiones. Los trastornos urinarios son el sintoma no motor mas frecuente en la enfermedad de Parkinson. Se presentan, habitualmente, como nicturia, urgencia y aumento de la frecuencia miccional (polaquiuria). El tratamiento de eleccion son los anticolinergicos. La disfuncion sexual es una queja frecuente en el enfermo parkinsoniano. Su etiologia es multifactorial y resulta mas frecuente en el varon que en la mujer. En el hombre se manifiesta principalmente como incapacidad para la ereccion, eyaculacion precoz o perdida de la capacidad para eyacular, mientras que en la mujer predomina la disminucion de la libido, la disminucion del arousal y la dificultad para alcanzar el orgasmo. La hipersexualidad afecta sobre todo a varones jovenes y se ha relacionado con el uso de agonistas dopaminergicos.",

      "abstract": "Parkinsonova bolest je kronicni progresivni poremecaj kod kojeg dolazi do neurodegeneracije sive tvari i smanjenja proizvodnje neurotransmitera dopamina. Parkinsonova bolest je, uz Alzheimerovu bolest, jedan od najucestalijih neurodegenerativnih poremecaja u svijetu. Simptomi se prvi put obicno pojavljuju između 50. i 65. godine. Glavni klinicki simptomi su tremor, rigor, bradikineza te posturalna nestabilnost. Uz navedene simptome javlja se zamor, hiposomija, poremecaj spavanja, bol te poremecaj kognitivnih funkcija. Etiologija same bolesti jos nije poznata, ali smatra se da je Parkinsonova bolest uzrok međudjelovanja genetskih i okolisnih cimbenika. Dijagnoza se temelji na uocenoj prisutnosti barem dva od tri glavna simptoma bolesti u klinickoj slici. Pri postavljanju dijagnoze potrebno je napraviti vise pregleda u duljem razdoblju pri cemu se prate simptomi i rabe razni testovi ukljucujuci detaljan neuroloski pregled, kompletni fizikalni pregled, uzimanje anamneze i procjenu genskog rizika. Fizioterapijska intervencija mora biti svrsishodna, primjerena mogucnostima pacijenta te individualno osmisljena. Razlicito je usmjerena kroz svaki od stupnjeva bolesti: rani, srednji i kasni. U ranom stupnju naglasak treba staviti na prevenciju misicno-kostanih ostecenja provođenjem aktivnog pokreta. Vježbe koje se preporucaju u ranom stupnju su: vježbe za balans i koordinaciju, vježbe za povecanje opsega pokreta, vježbe izdržljivosti, vježbe jacanja, vježbe istezanja, respiratorne vježbe i vježbe mimicne muskulature. U srednjem stupnju provode se tehnike za povecanje pokretljivosti i posturalne svjesnosti. Naglasak je na svakodnevnim aktivnostima kao sto su: sjedanje, dizanje iz razlicitih stolica, sjedanje na stolicu, lijeganje u krevet te ustajanje iz kreveta. U kasnom stupnju u slucaju potrebe za invalidskim kolicima poželjno je i osigurati opremu za laksu mobilnost u krevetu i transfer. Uz navedene intervencije pozitivan ucinak su pokazali PNF i Bobath koncept, terapija glazbom i plesom te Alexander tehnika. Osim primjene fizioterapijskih postupaka, edukacija i psihosocijalna podrska bolesnicima i clanovima obitelji, kao i osnivanje udruga bolesnika s Parkinsonovom bolesti, znacajno doprinosi razumijevanju bolesti. Fizioterapeut i ostali clanovi tima moraju naci nacin kako pristupiti takvom bolesniku, kako komunicirati s njim, kako pridobiti bolesnika na suradnju koja je bitna i kljucna za oporavak.",

These results suggest that PD in which depression precedes neurological symptoms is a specific subtype of PD.

      "abstract": "Parkinsonism is a progressive motor disease that affects 1.5 million Americans and is the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer’s. Typical neuropathological features of Parkinson’s disease (PD) include degeneration of dopaminergic neurons located in the pars compacta of the substantia nigra that project to the striatum (nigro-striatal pathway) and depositions of cytoplasmic fibrillary inclusions (Lewy bodies) which contain ubiquitin and α-synuclein. The cardinal motor signs of PD are tremors, rigidity, slow movement (bradykinesia), poor balance, and difficulty in walking (Parkinsonian gait). In addition to motor symptoms, non-motor symptoms that include autonomic and psychiatric as well as cognitive impairments are pressing issues that need to be addressed. Several different mechanisms play an important role in generation of Lewy bodies; endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress induced unfolded proteins, neuroinflammation and eventual loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of mid brain in PD. Moreover, these diverse processes that result in PD make modeling of the disease and evaluation of therapeutics against this devastating disease difficult. Here, we will discuss diverse mechanisms that are involved in PD, neuroprotective and therapeutic strategies currently in clinical trial or in preclinical stages, and impart views about strategies that are promising to mitigate PD pathology.",

      "abstract": "Movement disorders consist of a diverse and heterogeneous group of neurological impairments, frequently accompanied by abnormalities in ocular motility and visual perception. Parkinson’s disease is one of the more common and is caused by degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra of the midbrain with loss of dopamine terminals in the basal ganglia. It is regarded primarily as a disorder of the motor system with bradykinesia, rigidity, and tremor as its main features. However, autonomic, cognitive, and sensory symptoms frequently occur as well.\n\nVisual disturbance is not considered to be one of the cardinal clinical symptoms of Parkinson’s disease even though blurred vision, photophobia, asthenopia (weakness or fatigue of the eyes, usually accompanied by headache and dimming of vision), or trouble reading are common, often significantly interfering with the patient’s quality of life.1,2 Visual problems have particular significance because of the Parkinson patient’s impaired mobility and the implications for driving safety. In most cases, however, gross eye examination appears normal. Nonetheless, several papers have been published describing ophthalmological abnormalities, including problems with visual function, ocular movements, and visual hallucinations, as well as complications of drug therapy or neurosurgical interventions. We will review these in this article.\n\nThe most common ocular complaints are the result of ocular surface irritation, including blepharitis and xerophthalmia (dry eyes). Blepharitis is often responsible for ocular pain;3 dry eyes can cause itching, burning, irritation, and blurred vision that may improve with blinking. Unfortunately, spontaneous blinking is impaired, leading to discomfort, particularly after periods of reading, watching TV, or computer use. Blepharitis can cause excessive tearing, but most studies show decreased lacrimal flow in Parkinson patients, reflecting autonomic dysfunction.2,4\n\nThe decreased blink rate, a classical manifestation of Parkinson’s disease,5 is likely to worsen any discomfort from dry eyes, …",

      "abstract": "Dementia occurs in Parkinson's disease more commonly than in the general population. It is claimed that cortical and subcortical dementia syndromes can be commonly recognized, and that a variety of pathological lesions are responsible. Some persons presenting with dementia but no Parkinsonism also have the same basic pathological lesions seen in Parkinson's disease. By definition the brain pathology of Parkinson's disease consists of nerve cell loss associated with Lewy bodies in the substantia nigra. These Lewy bodies are filamentous inclusions present in nerve cells, many of which show degenerative change. The resulting degree of dopaminergic nigrostriatal neuronal depletion is sufficient to cause Parkinsonism. Such persons are said to have Lewy body disease, because Lewy bodies and neuronal degeneration are probably always present in other specific regions of the nervous system, namely the ventral tegmental area, locus coeruleus, raphe nuclei, thalamus, nucleus basalis of Meynert, cerebral cortex and the entire autonomic nervous system. The same pathological findings, except for major destruction of the substantia nigra, are present in a few persons without Parkinson's disease dying in late age, this pathological process being referred to as incidental Lewy body disease or pre symptomatic Parkinson's disease. Some patients with Lewy body disease develop dementia.",

      "abstract": "Olfactory dysfunction is an early ‘pre-clinical’ sign of Parkinson’s disease (PD). In this chapter I briefly review what is known about such dysfunction in PD and related diseases. In general, the dysfunction is robust and bilateral, anosmia is not the norm, women exhibit less loss than men, and some monogenetic forms of the disease exhibit the dysfunction. The loss is unrelated to disease stage or magnitude of the motor symptoms, save perhaps in the earliest stages of the disorder. Lewy body pathology, a hallmark of PD, appears to be correlated with the olfactory dysfunction, although it is not known whether this reflects a causal relationship. Dopamine is over-expressed in the olfactory bulbs of PD patients. Interestingly, deficiencies in other neurotransmitters, most notably acetylcholine, are correlated with the olfactory loss. A number of diseases often misdiagnosed as PD have little or no smell loss, including essential tremor, vascular parkinsonism, and progressive supranuclear palsy, making olfactory testing of value in differential diagnosis. The limited data suggest that the physiological basis of PD-related olfactory dysfunction is likely multifactorial, representing a combination of environmentally and genetically determined pathologies that involve multiple transmitter systems.",

Nedostatak dopamina smanjuje kontrolu koordinacije voljnih pokreta i pocetak motoricke radnje, uz javljanje nevoljnih pokreta, bradikineziju i rigidnost. Prvi puta ju spominje James Parkinson 1817.god. To je jedna od najucestalijih neurodegenerativnih bolesti uz prevalenciju 14 do 450 na 100 000 stanovnika, s tendencijom rasta. U Hrvatskoj je 6000 registriranih oboljelih, a procjene se krecu 15 do 20 000 ukupno oboljelih. Bolest rezultira razlicitim simptomima među kojima su oni vezani za gutanje i slinjenje među ucestalijima. U aktu gutanja sudjeluje pet živaca i 25 misica zbog cega su teskoce gutanja, uz promjene glasa, u pravilu prisutne od samoga pocetka pojave bolesti i cesto su njen prvi znak. Procjenjuje se da 50 do 75% (prema nekima i 100%) oboljelih ima smetnje gutanja. Znacajan problem vezan za logopedsku patologiju je i salivacija. Patogeneza disfagije i salivacije je multifaktorski uzrokovana, te ukljucuje kognitivne i psihosocijalne promjene zajedno s promjenama ekstrapiramidnog autonomnog živcanog sustava. Disfagija je karakterizirana razlicitim teskocama gutanja i povecanim rizikom aspiracije. U pocetnim su stadijima bolesti izraženije orofaringealne teskoce gutanja i zapocinjanje samoga refleksa zbog promjena u inervaciji poprecno-prugastih misica koji su voljno pokretani, a u kasnijim stadijima smetnje vezane za gutanje mogu biti prisutne u cijelome gornjem probavnom traktu. Logopedi do sada, za razliku od prakse u razvijenim zemljama, nisu znacajnije ukljucivani u pracenje i rehabilitaciju osoba oboljelih od ove bolesti. Važnost sudjelovanja logopeda najvise potkrepljuje podatak kako su, cesto, disfagija i salivacija prvi simptomi bolesti.

Some neurological conditions characterized by movement disorders that start or persist during sleep hinder sleep onset and/or sleep continuity, causing a poor sleep complaint. CNS lesions and/or dysfunction in three specific neurological conditions (fatal familial insomnia, Morvan's chorea, and delirium tremens) impair the basic mechanisms of sleep generation inducing a syndrome in which the inability to sleep is consistently associated with motor and sympathergic overactivation.

Najčešći simptomi pacijenata koji boluju od Parkinsonove bolesti su tremor u mirovanju, rigidnost, bradikinezija i poremećaj hoda. Liječenje Parkinsonove bolesti složeno je. Razlog tome je kompleksnost bolesti te dugogodišnja progresija. Liječenje može biti medikamentozno ili invazivnim metodama liječenja poput duboke mozgovne stimulacije. Kod medikamentoznog liječenja koristimo tri kategorije lijekova. Prva kategorija lijekova povećava razinu dopamina u mozgu, druga kategorija lijekova, kao što su antikolinergički lijekovi, smanjuje simptome Parkinsonove bolesti i treća kategorija djeluje na nemotoričke simptome Parkinsonove bolesti. Ako medikamentozno liječenje nije dostatno, danas se najviše primjenjuje duboka mozgovna stimulacija. Duboka mozgovna stimulacija je neurokirurška intervencija kojom se ugrađuje elektroda u područje subtalamičke jezgre, ventralne intermedijalne jezgre ili u područje globus pallidus, jer se motoričke komplikacije Parkinsonove bolesti ne mogu adekvatno kupirati lijekovima. Prije same neurokirurške intervencije važna je prijeoperacijska priprema i procjena pacijenata koji su potencijalni kandidati za ovakav zahvat.

      "abstract": "Abstract Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is the second most common form of neurodegenerative parkinsonism after idiopathic Parkinson’s disease. Patients most often present with an insidious change in balance, personality, or cognitive function that characteristically leads to severe postural instability, vertical supranuclear gaze palsy, and death within seven or eight years; this classic clinical presentation is now know as Richardson syndrome (also Steele–Richardson–Olszewski syndrome). Less commonly, patients present with bradykinesia and rigidity (PSP–parkinsonism) which is only later followed by the emergence of falls, eye movement abnormalities, and cognitive impairment; others may present with pure akinesia and gait freezing (PSP–PAGF), corticobasal syndrome (PSP–CBS), or progressive non-fluent aphasia (PSP–PNFA). The characteristic neuropathological findings of abnormal accumulations of neurofibrillary tau protein in the subthalamic nucleus and other brainstem regions define the disease, and because of these findings PSP is included amongst the primary ‘tauopathies’. Corticobasal degeneration (CBD) is another rarer tauopathy characterized by the accumulation of neurofibrillary and oligodendroglial tau in the cortex and basal ganglia. The classic ‘motor’ presentation of CBD is known as ‘corticobasal syndrome’: a combination of limb apraxia, cortical sensory loss, alien limb, focal myoclonus, and limb dystonia, as well as rigidity and bradykinesia that do not respond to dopaminergic medications. Corticobasal syndrome is not specific to CBD and is also known to occur in other diseases such as PSP, Alzheimer’s diseas,e and the frontotemporal dementias. The ‘cognitive’ presentation of CBD typically includes behavioural disturbance, including personality change and executive dysfunction, and progressive non-fluent aphasia. There is some clinical and pathological overlap between these two conditions, and progressive decline over six to twelve years is usual in both. There are no disease-modifying therapies for PSP or CBD, and treatment is focused on optimizing independence, minimizing the complications of the advancing parkinsonism, and supporting care-givers.",

En Mexico, ocupa el tercer lugar en frecuencia dentro de las enfermedades neurologicas atendidas en el Instituto Nacional de Neurologia y Neurocirugia. Esta patologia se caracteriza por la perdida de las neuronas dopaminergicas ubicadas en la sustancia nigra que controlan el movimiento motor voluntario. Estas neuronas tienen prolongaciones que inervan el cuerpo estriado y donde ocurre la liberacion de la dopamina, uno de los principales neurotransmisores que participan en numerosas funciones como coordinacion motora, emociones, memoria, mecanismos de recompensa, entre otras. La perdida de las neuronas dopaminergicas causa una disminucion en el contenido de dopamina, lo que ocasiona los sintomas caracteristicos de la enfermedad. Existen varios mecanismos celulares que se activan antes de que ocurra la muerte neuronal. Uno de los principales mecanismos que juega un papel relevante en la progresion de la muerte de las neuronas dopaminergicas, es la neuroinflamacion.",

Whilst it was historically considered to be a movement disorder there are multiple non-motor symptoms, which often precede the motor symptoms by years or even decades.

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by resting tremor, slow and decreased movement (hypokinesia and akinesia), rigidity, postural instability, problems with gait, and coordination. The prevalence of PD is between 0.1% and 0.3% in the general population and between 1% and 2% in persons 65 years of age or older. Patients with PD are more likely to suffer from pain. Indeed, the chief complaint of patients with severe motor disturbance and severe pain is pain rather than motor disturbance. Fibromyalgia (FM) is defined by widespread pain (pain in the left and right sides of the body, pain above the waist, pain below the waist, and axial skeletal pain) for more than 3 months and the presence of at least 11 of the 18 specified tender points. FM and chronic widespread pain (CWP), which is usually an incomplete form of FM, cause pain in the musculoskeletal region, but their etiologies are unknown. Therefore, it is almost impossible to determine whether or not pain in the musculoskeletal region is in the musculoskeletal origin. We suspect that dysfunction or degeneration of the nerves that control pain, mind, and movement in the brain causes FM, depression, and PD, respectively. When pain in PD is discussed, FM and CWP should be considered because their prevalence is high. Patients with PD may be likely to suffer from FM and CWP; however, the prevalence of FM and CWP in patients with PD has not been reported. Here, we discuss the relationship between PD and FM or CWP.",

The latest studies of toxic substance-based animal models of PD suggest that genomic silencing of the inflammasomes hinders neuroinflammation, and is neuroprotective which supports this hypothesis. The key manifestations reported in patients with PD are categorized into: initial symptoms; primary motor symptoms; secondary motor symptoms; primary nonmotor symptoms; and secondary nonmotor symptoms. James Parkinson first identified PD as the \"shaking palsy\" or agitans of paralysis in 1817 caused by a rather precise and gradual neurodegeneration of pigmented nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. The initial symptoms are mild and gradually improve, which makes them hard to detect. Sexual impairment is one of the primary factors for worsening of a PD patient's quality of life.",

As far as cognitive deficits are manifest in parkinsonian patients at an early stage of the disease, many studies tend to describe them as fitting a frontal syndrome. As a consequence of dysfunction of the striatum, the (pre)frontal cortex receives deficient input from the striatum, which might explain the similarity of the cognitive deficits of parkinsonian patients with those of patients with frontal dysfunction. The present studies provide evidence that the cognitive deficits of parkinsonian patients display a certain similarity with those of patients with frontal dysfunction at the level of the ultimate performance, but that the underlying processes have a distinct character. Parkinsonian patients exhibit a decrease in self-generated problem-solving. This deficit is manifest at a level of cognitive function, which goes beyond task or domain. Among all disease variables, only severity of the disease and especially rigidity proved to be related consistently to this decrease in self-generated problem-solving.",

      "abstract": "Summary Comorbidity commonly refers to the cooccurrence (o r dual diagnosis) of two disorders or syndromes in the same patient, regardless of whether the disorders are coincidentally or causally linked. Indeed, illnesses have been classified in discrete diagnostic categories although no sharp discontinuities in symptom distributions are observed across most mental disorders. Depression is a relatively common psychiatric comorbididy of most neurological disorders, with prevalence rates ranging between 20 and 50% among patients with stroke, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease and dementia. Furthermore, depression is an independent predictor of poor quality of life in these patients and has a negative impact on the response to treatment, course and recovery of neurological deficits. Comorbid depressive disorders in neurologic patients can be indistinguishable to the primary mood disorders and may mimic major depression, dysthymic, minor depressive, and bipolar disorders described in the DSMIV classification of mood disorders. In addition, the great overlap of medical and psychiatric symptoms in depression and neurologic disorders may lead to both falsepositiv e and falsenegative diagnoses of depression. Patient with comorbid condition have lower response rate and /or a longer time to response, greater reports of side effect early in treatment and greater likely hood of dropping out. In this review, we focus on comorbid disorder associated with depression.",

Additional brain regions also affected in clinical Parkinson's disease include the ventral tegmental area, locus coeruleus, serotonergic dorsal raphe system, and the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus ( I) . Furthermore, it has been suggested that damage to these various regions of the brain leads to a variety of motor and mental disorders (depression and dementia) that are specific to the damage in each of these neuronal systems (2) .

      "abstract": "Most of the literature regarding the importance of accurately and efficiently differentiating neuropsychiatric symptoms as secondary to medical conditions or as a primary psychiatric illnesses is found in the emergency department setting. It has been reported that 6 to 12% of patients presenting to the emergency department have psychiatric complaints or behavioral disturbances.12 Patients with psychiatric or behavioral disturbances are generally \"medically cleared\" prior to transfer to psychiatric care.2 Assessing if a patient is \"medically cleared\" helps to identify medical illnesses that could cause or contribute to psychiatric or behavioral symptoms which may make treatment at a psychiatric facility inappropriate or even dangerous.2 Appropriate treatment in the emergency department setting, therefore, may prevent morbidity and mortality associated with misdiagnosing of a medical illness as a psychiatric illness and from improper treatment of psychiatric illnesses.2 When psychiatric, neurologic, or behavioral manifestations are secondary to medical conditions, the focus of treatment should be on the underlying condition.3 This can be said for any kind of signs or symptoms – rarely is a single or set of signs or symptoms addressed without an evaluation for the underlying root cause. Symptomatic treatment of the neuropsychiatric manifestations, however, should not be overlooked and should run parallel to the primary condition.3To help identify a primary psychiatric illness compared to symptoms secondary to a medical illness, several factors that may assist in clarifying diagnosis include a focus on cognitive versus somatic symptoms, identification of personal or family history of psychiatric illness and response to treatment, careful neurologic exam emphasizing cognitive and mental status exam as part of the physical exam, and an understanding that a psychiatric diagnosis is not purely a diagnosis of exclusion of medical illnesses.3 Features suggesting that psychiatric symptoms are secondary to a medical illness include an abrupt onset with no known or readily recognizable precipitants, a temporal association with onset, worsening, or remission of the psychiatric symptoms concurrent with the medical illness, and the presence of atypical features.34 Additionally, the absence of a personal or family history of psychiatric diagnosis, late onset of new behavioral symptoms, obvious systemic disease, evidence of increased intracranial pressure, nonauditory hallucinations, use of psychoactive or centrally-acting medications, the occurrence of autonomic dysfunction with good premorbid function, and treatment resistance further suggest a medical origin.4 Though routine laboratory testing of all psychiatric patients presenting to the emergency department has not been supported in the literature, it is suggested that a complete history (including a detailed medication history) and physical exam with a full set of vital signs may be sufficient to exclude medical reasons for symptom presentation.125 Further laboratory and ancillary testing may be guided by the obtained information.125 Obtaining information directly from the patient may be, at times, difficult to obtain, therefore, collateral history from bystanders, family, friends, caregivers, health care professionals, law enforcement, paramedics, etc. is important.2Illnesses that may be commonly known to be associated with psychiatric symptoms are presented in Table 1. Increasing awareness and understanding of neuropsychiatric symptoms and adverse effects (and subsequently, management) may lead to more appropriate therapy choices or management and improved patient care. Additionally, comorbid medical illnesses may have implications on psychotropic medication selection. This issue of the Mental Health Clinician highlights psychiatric and neurologic manifestations of medical illnesses or those adverse effects secondary to medications.",

      "abstract": "This chapter discusses Parkinson's disease (PD). PD is primarily characterized by motor symptoms; these include bradykinesia with rigidity and/or rest tremor according to the latest diagnostic criteria. Dr James Parkinson noted that the disease came on gradually, beginning in the hands and arms before moving through the rest of the body, and observed the weariness, inconvenience, and anguish it provoked in its victims. Nowadays, an increasingly more prominent role is being given to non-motor symptoms of PD; efforts are accordingly being made to produce a reclassification of clinical subtypes. Parkinsonism is principally divided into primary and secondary types. While potential causes of secondary parkinsonism should always be investigated and, when possible, treated, primary parkinsonism embraces a number of neurodegenerative disorders of multifactorial origin. The most common type of primary parkinsonism is PD. Another group of degenerative disorders is labelled atypical parkinsonism. The designation ‘atypical’ mainly refers to the poor levodopa response and the early manifestation of additional clinical features such as ophthalmoparesis, dysautonomia, apraxia, or dementia. Finally, the differential diagnosis of parkinsonism also encompasses a wide range of rare hereditary degenerative disorders that should be taken into account if the clinical presentation is not typical.",

      "title": "Axial Postural Abnormalities in Parkinsonism: Gaps in Predictors, Pathophysiology, and Management",
      "abstract": "Axial postural abnormalities are common and disabling motor complications of Parkinson's disease (PD) and parkinsonism. They consist of abnormal trunk or neck postures in the upright position, often interfering with daily life activities.1-5 A high number of patients with PD may develop one or more axial postural abnormalities, which may begin as minor forms, almost universal in persons with parkinsonism (eg, minor flexed posture of the trunk and lower limbs), and progress to severe forms such as camptocormia, antecollis, or Pisa syndrome in over 20% of patients,1 although the definitions of severe axial postural abnormalities were purely based on subjective/expert opinion. Drug-induced parkinsonism or progressive supranuclear palsy may also present axial postural abnormalities, and in multiple system atrophy these symptoms are more frequent than in PD and occur earlier in the disease course.2, 6 Because axial postural abnormalities are associated with an increased risk of falling, pain, and diminished quality of life, their proper prevention and management is warranted.2, 4, 5, 7, 8 However, to date, recommendations for multidisciplinary management and prevention remain an unmet need.3 Diagnosis is typically based on a simple clinical examination, whereas treatments (eg, pharmacological, physical therapy, and surgical treatments) have been evaluated only in small single-center studies that failed to show consistent, long-lasting improvement.2, 5, 8-10 The absence of reliable protocols for the assessment, treatment, and prevention of axial postural abnormalities in parkinsonism is probably due to the largely obscure pathophysiology and uncertainty about prognostic factors needed to estimate beneficial responses to therapy (eg, duration of axial postural abnormalities).2, 5, 8, 11-13 The aim of this viewpoint is to critically analyze the literature on axial postural abnormalities, identify the current issues and gaps, and formulate proposals for current clinical management and future research exploration. Research on clinical predictors and risk factors for the onset of axial postural abnormalities in parkinsonism was mainly limited by the low quality of the methodology in the available literature (Supporting Information).2, 5, 8 Indeed, only a few studies were aimed primarily at the analysis of risk factors, and most studies were cross-sectional, lacking adequate longitudinal follow-up. In most cases the patient sample (usually PD) was heterogeneous for disease severity and stage. Clinical predictors were investigated for all axial postural abnormalities; however, the dependent variable in many studies was the presence of more than one axial postural abnormality, rather than a singular one. This approach renders it difficult to identify clinical predictors specific for each axial postural abnormality, which may vary between camptocormia, Pisa syndrome, and antecollis. Also, the cutoffs defining an axial postural abnormality differed across studies and were not stated in many cases. This generated possible bias in the prevalence rates due to differences in the clinical characteristics of patient samples. The identification of clinical predictors in patient samples presenting different degrees of trunk/neck flexion is challenging and limits interpretation of the study results. For example, patients with greater trunk flexion may also have more motor complications (ie, motor fluctuations) that make it difficult to identify the clinical predictors for mild axial forms (ie, anterior trunk flexion),3 which are of major clinical interest for prevention strategies. Finally, the variability in tools and reference bone points used for quantifying the degree of axial postural abnormalities renders comparison of study results arduous. The pathophysiology of axial postural abnormalities in PD is not clear, but several causes have been proposed,2, 5, 8 including central mechanisms (eg, imbalance in basal ganglia functioning leading to dystonia/rigidity, altered sensory–motor integration, higher cognitive function deficits) and/or peripheral mechanisms (ie, alteration in the musculoskeletal system).2, 5, 8 The main pathophysiological mechanisms considered in the literature are discussed here (Supporting Information). Dystonia, or a more general hyperactivity of paraspinal and nonparaspinal muscles, is the most common explanation for axial disability based on findings from electromyographic investigation.2, 5, 8, 9, 14-20 The hypothesis that dystonia underlies axial postural abnormalities is supported by three main findings: (1) the existence of drug-induced Pisa syndrome or camptocormia, (2) the (rare) existence of sensory tricks to alleviate some postural abnormalities, and (3) evidence of misalignment improvement by botulinum toxin type-A or lidocaine administration in some patients.2, 5, 8 However, in patients with Pisa syndrome, electromyography findings have been inconsistent concerning the side (ipsilateral or contralateral) of hyperactivity of paraspinal and nonparaspinal muscles in relation to trunk bending and PD asymmetry.16, 18, 19 Some studies suggested two different electromyographical patterns: (1) hyperactivity of lumbar and thoracic paraspinals ipsilateral to the trunk-leaning side during quiet stance and voluntary contralateral trunk flexion18, 21 and (2) hyperactivity of nonparaspinal muscles (eg, external oblique muscles, rectus femoris, and iliopsoas) ipsilaterally to the leaning side during quite stance and during voluntary contralateral trunk flexion.17 The paraspinal muscles contralateral to the side of flexion may have a compensatory action to further limit trunk bending.17 Other studies reported tonic and persistent activity in the paraspinal thoracic muscle and/or abdominal oblique muscles ipsilateral to the bending side and less-affected PD side, along with reduced/absent activity of the same muscles on the opposite side.19 In patients with camptocormia, studies suggested that the bilateral abdominal internal and the external oblique muscles, together with the rectus abdominis muscles, may be responsible for camptocormia with thoracic fulcrum,14 whereas rectus abdominis and iliopsoas hyperactivity could be more frequently involved in camptocormia with lumbar fulcrum.14, 20 Another study found hyperactivity of paraspinal muscles (ie, iliocostalis lumborum, longissimus, and multifidus) and, to a lesser extent, the rectus femoris but not rectus abdominis.15 It is probable that some hyperactivities observed in camptocormia, like those of paraspinal muscles that are spine erectors, are compensatory. Patients with antecollis showed hypertrophy and active spasms or hyperactivity in anterior (sternocleidomastoid muscles) and posterior (semispinalis, splenius capitis, trapezius, and levator scapulae) neck muscles.2 Passive head-up maneuvers may be limited by marked bilateral contractions of sternocleidomastoid muscles.2 The paucity of studies and objective measures to identify and quantify dystonia complicates the interpretation of these findings. Needle electromyography (EMG) has limited use because it is invasive and can be challenging when applied in deep muscles. Also, interpretation of needle EMG is relatively subjective as it is technically difficult to perform and has not been standardized for investigating axial muscles, and quantitative normative measures for activation of these muscle groups are not available. Finally, when EMG is performed in those with long-standing symptoms, it remains difficult to reliably separate primary abnormalities (ie, those causing postural abnormalities) from secondary ones (ie, resulting from the chronic changes in posture, or related to compensatory mechanisms). No studies have specifically and systematically evaluated rigidity in patients with axial postural abnormalities. During clinical examination in the supine position, patients demonstrate almost complete resolution of trunk bending, whereas when sitting or standing the paravertebral muscles may appear to have a wooden consistency.2, 15 The association between axial postural abnormalities and a more severe motor impairment and a rigid-akinetic phenotype makes rigidity a process worthy of investigation, albeit difficult to measure it empirically. Patients with PD have difficulty in properly controlling their postural stabilization and orientation (and also their interaction) based on sensory information from muscles and joints.2 PD patients with Pisa syndrome or camptocormia find it more difficult to achieve good postural alignment with gravity and display greater velocity of body sway than patients without axial postural abnormalities.22, 23 Patients with camptocormia with a lower fulcrum may have more severe gait and postural control deficits than patients with a thoracic fulcrum or patients without camptocormia.23 However, no studies have so far investigated the relationship between antecollis and postural instability. Postural control is a complex system involving the integration of different sensory inputs, including vestibular, visual, and proprioceptive. Some findings support the notion that proprioceptive function/kinesthesia is abnormal in PD.22, 23 Evidence was initially restricted to motor control of the limbs,24 but more recent studies22, 23 showed that proprioceptive defects might also affect axial motor control not only in the yaw plane (turning about the vertical axis)24 but also in the sagittal and coronal planes. Further studies are needed to understand the contribution of defective proprioceptive and kinesthesia in the pathophysiology of axial postural abnormalities.2, 24 Moreover, postural control depends on vestibular information. PD patients with Pisa syndrome may present with a central, peripheral, or mixed vestibular dysfunction2 along with a deviation in the subjective visual vertical,25 which was estimated to occur in about 67% of PD patients.26 A recent case–control study found worse performance on visuospatial ability tasks by PD patients with Pisa syndrome compared to PD controls without axial postural abnormalities.27 Visuospatial deficits are associated with dysfunctional subjective visual vertical, possibly contributing to altered perception of the trunk in space and the development of Pisa syndrome but not camptocormia.27 Whether visual spatial deficits and subjective visual vertical are defective and might also contribute to the development of antecollis has not been systematically investigated yet. Moreover, postural control demands complex motor–cognitive interactions that rely on high attentional resources and conserved executive functions. Some studies reported lower scores on tasks exploring executive functions (ie, divided attention, inhibitory control, and delayed free recall in verbal learning), perceptual visuospatial functions, and language for patients with Pisa syndrome compared to patients with PD without axial postural abnormalities.2, 5, 8, 28 Nevertheless, the association between kinesthetic/proprioceptive and cognitive deficits with axial postural abnormalities remains controversial. Without further details from pathophysiology studies, and also without intervention studies, three possibilities remain: (1) these deficits are a mere association (ie, they merely coincide with those with more severe disease), (2) these dysfunctions are not causal but rather a secondary manifestation (ie, they result as a consequence of the axial postural abnormalities), or (3) they are actually a contributing factor. The bulk of evidence from EMG (eg, fibrillation potentials, small polyphasic motor unit potentials, and weakness),5, 8, 14, 15, 17, 19, 29-34 muscle biopsy (eg, abnormal histology),5, 8, 29-32, 35 and muscle imaging (eg, fatty infiltration of muscles and muscle atrophy)5, 8, 9, 14, 17, 19, 29-31, 36 suggests myopathy as a contributing factor to the development of axial postural abnormalities. The cause of myopathy remains unclear, but ongoing research marks it as a secondary myopathic process, as a consequence of a chronically maintained abnormal posture.34 These phenomena probably reflect a continuum from early myopathic changes (ie, edema and partial swelling, contrast enhancement without degenerative muscle changes) in the early stages of camptocormia to progression to muscle atrophy and fatty degeneration in the end stage as shown by muscle magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and biopsy. Although the exact cause of these muscular changes is unclear, they may arise due to muscle disuse or denervation secondary to chronic primary trunk misalignment. Camptocormia might be a consequence of overusing paraspinal muscles due to rigidity in patients with PD or a pronounced proprioceptive dysregulation in the context of underlying disease. Although a primary myopathy has been suggested to explain Pisa syndrome,19 no pathological studies have proven this hypothesis. Therefore, the observed muscular changes are probably caused by secondary mechanisms. The atrophy of paraspinal muscles ipsilateral to the bending side may be due to muscle disuse (excluded because of hyperactivity of nonparaspinal muscles) and cannot contribute to the development of Pisa syndrome; contralateral muscle atrophy instead might be secondary to the stress of prolonged stretching, as a consequence of muscle weakness, theoretically leading to Pisa syndrome.17 The mechanical efficiency of muscular activation of trunk extension (especially at the thoracic level) was markedly reduced in PD patients with camptocormia compared to those with PD without postural issues and to healthy controls, which suggests impairment of neuromuscular recruitment.34 The EMG of the paraspinal muscles is technically difficult, but this disadvantage is relative, as MRI and muscle biopsy can show the presence of myopathy. Although the finding of a monomorphic myopathy in the camptocormia of PD patients can be considered corroborated,35 the clarification of its cause remains an important task. Currently, the recording of myopathy with its subdivision into acute and chronic forms of muscle changes provides clues for therapeutic options.12 Postural improvement after high-frequency deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the bilateral subthalamic nuclei37 supports the notion that axial postural abnormalities may result from dysfunction of the basal ganglia. There is limited evidence for the presence of drug-induced axial postural abnormalities in persons with parkinsonism,2, 5, 8 with a dose reduction (or even complete withdrawal) or switching to another dopaminergic medication leading to improvement in posture.2, 8, 38 Finally, patients with axial postural abnormalities may present with a concomitant clinical history of back surgery (eg, laminectomy), degenerative spinal conditions, or trauma, which may have mechanical effects on bones or soft tissue (eg, muscles or fascia) and predisposing to their development.39 In clinical practice, the first step is to objectively measure the degree of trunk and/or neck flexion preferably while the patient is wearing only underwear (Fig. 1) during standing and walking.40 We suggest to investigate the possible presence of mild forms of axial postural abnormalities at each visit and inform and educate patients and caregivers on these symptoms; when actual axial postural abnormalities have been identified, clinicians could consider pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions for their treatment. Figure 2 shows a practical road map as guidance for their clinical management. Four major issues may have limited the progress of research in this field: (1) different nosology and cutoffs to define axial postural abnormalities, (2) lack of common and objective assessment procedures, (3) heterogeneity of study design, and (4) heterogeneity of patient samples. Future research should focus on their clinical evaluation in terms of early detection and quantification using consensus-based criteria.3 Prospective, observational, long-term studies with large samples are immediately needed to explore the potential risk (causal) factors and pathophysiology involved in their development. From a therapeutic point of view, we call for well-controlled clinical trials: randomized trials using standard criteria for inclusion and endpoint measurement3 are needed to compare the efficacy of different pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions and their combined effect (ie, botulinum toxin injections + physiotherapy). Such controlled studies could also focus on the merits of dopaminergic therapy withdrawal when these are suspected to have played a role in causing axial postural abnormalities. Moreover, we suggest researchers focus on a single postural abnormality per study, because risk factors, pathophysiology, and response to treatments may vary between camptocormia, Pisa syndrome, and antecollis. Finally, prevention programs using common diagnostic criteria3 should be investigated to study how the development of axial postural abnormalities can be avoided. Educate patients and their families to monitor possible improvement or worsening of posture. Adjustment of pharmacological therapy: remove the prescribed dopaminergic therapy potentially associated with the subacute onset of axial postural abnormality. The removal of therapy needs to be done very cautiously as this may also lead to a worsening of the underlying parkinsonism.8 Other expert opinion–based options include the following: botulinum toxin injection of hyperactive muscles should be cautiously considered for each patient based on EMG findings, in carefully selected patients, under the care of experts; avoiding injections of compensatory paraspinal and nonparaspinal muscles; prompt physiotherapy intervention to strengthen weak/compensatory trunk/neck muscles and improve balance and mobility; and prescription of walking aids (ie, high-frame walker) if needed. When a patient is suitable for DBS aimed at managing motor symptoms, camptocormia, and Pisa syndrome could also improve after surgery. Orthopedic surgery should be considered in very selected cases: patients should be properly counseled regarding the increased risk of operative complications and closely followed for incipient failure.

      "title": "Diagnosis and Pharmacological Management of Parkinson’s Disease: A Review",
      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a common and progressive neurological illness affecting persons aged 55 to 65. Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurological disorder. It has the potential to result in considerable impairment and a low quality of life. However, symptomatic medications may assist patients in living more comfortably. Apart from distal resting tremor and stiffness, the condition manifests itself via bradykinesia and an asymmetric start. Progressive motor and non-motor symptoms have a detrimental effect on an individual's overall quality of life. Non-motor symptoms are increasingly gaining recognition. It might be difficult to treat both motor and non-motor complaints. As a result, primary care physicians should be capable of diagnosing and treating Parkinson's disease. The article examines various healthcare practitioners' diagnosis accuracy and their use of multiple diagnostic procedures to differentiate Parkinson's disease from other comparable illnesses. There is no cure for Parkinson's disease, although there are treatments. On the other hand, it examines non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Drug-induced dyskinesia is a side effect of levodopa, the primary Parkinson's disease medication. Treatment with a dopamine agonist initially alleviates motor problems. Alternative medications (monoamine oxidase type B inhibitors (MAOBIs), amantadine, anticholinergics, b-blockers, or dopamine agonists) may be provided first to avoid levodopa-related motor difficulties. Modifying the levodopa dosage or adding MAOBIs or dopamine agonists may assist in regulating motor fluctuations. Primary care doctors will benefit from this article's focus on early diagnosis and pharmaceutical treatment of Parkinson's disease's characteristic motor symptoms. Parkinson's disease-related motor symptoms may be treated with levodopa and dopamine agonists, according to several trials. No evidence exists to back up alternative treatments for motor or non-motor symptoms. A subspecialist's opinion is often sought. Key words: Parkinson disease, tremor, levodopa, dopamine.",

The motor symptoms of this disease, as well as non-motor symptoms is quite common. Among non-motor symptoms of sexual dysfunction, and hypersexuality, may be due to the disease itself or the drugs used.In this study, anti-Parkinson medication caused by the increased frequency of sexual desire were evaluated and compared with the control group. In addition, the frequency of sexual dysfunction in patients with Parkinson?s disease were also investigated.Parkinson's disease, duration and stage of the disease and the medication were not risk factors for hypersexuality. Patients with and without dopamine agonist were similar in terms of frequency of hypersexuality .Under the appropriate treatment of Parkinson's patients, the incidence of sexual dysfunction were not increased compared to those without Parkinson?s disease.It was found that sexual function is better in women with Parkinson? disease.Hypersexuality which is known induced by antiparkinson medication especially with dopamine agonists, may be also associated with other factors. Good evaluation and treatment of sexual dysfunction and hypersexuality is very important in terms of quality of life in Parkinson?s disease.",

The incidental finding of Lewy bodies can precede clinical Parkinson's disease. It is thought they do not occur as an age‐related feature, although this cannot be stated with certainty.

      "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease was the first neurodegenerative disease in which a deficient neurotransmitter (dopamine) was succesfully replaced by a systemically administered drug (levodopa). However, chronic levodopa therapy is associated with the development of motor and psychiatric complications. Furthermore, the progressive course of the disease is not halted and levodopa-resistant symptoms, such as dementia or postural instability, eventually appear. Most of these problems are related to the progressive nature of Parkinson’s disease. Therefore, stopping or slowing the progression of Parkinson’s disease is one of the main therapeutic objectives. Since the discovery of1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-induced parkinsonism in the early 1980s, the possibility of protecting dopaminergic nigral neurons against the action of toxic insults has attracted the attention of the neurological community. Could Parkinson’s disease also be the first neurodegenerative condition with a potential neuroprotective treatment? The promise of rational neuroprotective therapy is generating much excitement and some frustration among researchers. In this article, the state of the art of neuroprotection in Parkinson’s disease is reviewed.",

Firstly, the clinical presentation of a dementia disorder, especially in the elderly, may involve features consistent with the clinical diagnostic guidelines for the syndrome of dementia with Lewy bodies, including fluctuating cognitive performance, visual hallucination and mild features of parkinsonism. Secondly, patients with an established neurological diagnosis of Parkinson's disease have an increased risk of developing dementia during their illness. At these extremes the clinical diagnoses are distinct, but many patients are encountered who are less easy to classify clinically. Throughout this spectrum the pathological features of brain and peripheral nerve disease are overlapping and do not provide the basis for clear-cut syndromic diagnoses. Cognitive impairment in dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease dementia is associated with more extensive anatomical spread of α-synucleinopathy in the brain and variable, often extensive, Alzheimer type pathology. Both dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease dementia present challenges for clinicopathological correlation and diagnosis.",

Cognitive decline in PD exists as a continuum, with symptoms ranging from normal cognition to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and finally dementia (PDD). MCI is clinically heterogeneous and its progression varies with cases reverting to normal cognition. On the contrary, when dementia occurs, the decline is usually rapid and stereotyped. The combination of Lewy and Alzheimer's disease pathology is the most robust pathological correlate of PDD. There are no approved drugs for PD-MCI and the benefit from the only approved symptomatic treatment for PDD is modest.

      "abstract": "Abstract The diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease (PD) is not always simple. Even seasoned physicians may be troubled by certain cases. For the person with PD, recognizing that something is wrong may take months. The onset is insidious and symptoms may blend into the routine. Although tremor may provide a clear signal, many people do not experience this as one of their initial symptoms. Some of the manifestations of PD may be so subtle and nonspecific that they are not even appreciated as being abnormal. For example, they may be written off to age: “Of course I’m slowing down; I’m getting older.” Or some other explanation may seem plausible: “I walk bent over because my back hurts.” On the other hand, certain signs may be incorrectly attributed to PD. Not all tremor represents PD, and in fact the majority of people with tremor do not have PD. Parkinson’s disease is a clinical diagnosis made in the doctor’s office. The story plus examination findings provide the evidence. There are no laboratory tests that identify PD. The tests are primarily for the purpose of excluding other disorders and are often not needed (see chapter 7 on testing). In this chapter, we focus on the clinical clues that point us to the diagnosis.",

      "abstract": "Dementia more than one year after the onset of motor features associated with Parkinson's disease is defined as Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD). If it develops within one year of the motor features, the term dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) is used. Since clinical and pathological features are similar, it is generally accepted that both represent a continuum of the same disorder. PDD together with DLB account for around one fifth of all cases of dementia in the elderly. Studies suggest that most patients with Parkinson's disease would eventually develop dementia if they lived long enough. The diagnosis of PDD in the presence of long-standing pronounced motor features rarely poses a diagnostic dilemma. However, the diagnosis of DLB may be more difficult. It relies on the revised consensus clinical criteria which require the presence of at least two of the following three syndromes: persistent visual hallucinations, fluctuating defects in cognitive and functional ability, and parkinsonism. An early referral to a specialist clinic may not only help to confirm the diagnosis, but also to co-ordinate the group of professionals working with the patient. Well lit rooms and the use of glasses and hearing aids can help to reduce hallucinations. Cholinesterase inhibitors used in Alzheimer's disease have a role in DLB and PDD. Trials show moderate improvements in cognitive function in patients treated with rivastigmine. The greatest impact, however, seems to be on the psychotic features of the disease. Patients with DLB are less likely to have a good motor response from L-dopa than patients with Parkinson's disease or PDD.",

It occurs before disease onset as a prodromal symptom, during and then throughout the disease course. Causes are multifactorial and can be multiple in the same patient. Specific sleep disorders that are known to occur in those with Parkinson's disease include REM sleep behavior disorder, sleep disordered breathing including obstructive sleep apnea, restless legs and periodic limb movements, nightmare disorder, insomnia alongside direct side-effects of the medication used for therapy. One key question is whether these sleep disorders impact upon the motor and non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease. There has been significant interest in recent years in using certain sleep disorders, in particular, REM sleep behavior disorder, as a biomarker both for those at risk of Parkinson's disease but also influencing the subsequent severity and speed of progression. However, other sleep disorders in the general population may also increase the risk of developing Parkinson's disease. It is important to understand whether the treatment of sleep disturbance and specific sleep disorders modifies the long-term risk of developing Parkinson's disease or its progression.",

This disease is most common in the elderly, what makes it a prominent health problem in developed countries, where the elder population is expected to importantly increase in the future. The mechanism generating the disease is the death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), a small brain region from the brain stem. These neurons release the neurotransmitter dopamine to the basal ganglia, a large and complex brain structure implicated in motor control and reinforcement learning. Once SNc neurons have died, the basal ganglia starts showing prominent features of malfunction, and the characteristics symptoms of Parkinson's disease began to be observed in the patient (i.e. general difficulty or inability to execute motor movements and limb tremor, among others). Modern theory of Parkinson's disease focuses on the abnormal brain activity oscillations observed in the basal ganglia, which are consistently observed in parkinsonian patients and correlate with their symptoms. This paper develops a mathematical model of the basal ganglia, which reproduces the experimentally recorded neuronal activity of this brain structure in health and disease. Studying this model numerical and analytically, we draw conclusion on how and where these oscillations are generated within the brain. If the conclusions of this mathematical model are further confirmed experimentally, we think they pave the way towards controlling such oscillations pharmacologically or through electrode stimulation in the future.",

Over the course of the disease and across all its stages, virtually every individual with PD experiences some degree of cognitive deficit, ranging from mild cognitive impairment to dementia. Across this spectrum, cognitive impairments affect functioning and quality of life, often more than motor aspects of the disease. Advances in treatments for motor deficits in PD now render the clinical significance of cognitive dysfunction more obvious, including its impact on psychiatric presentations and their treatment. Since cognitive dysfunction is underdetected and undertreated in clinical practice, holistic psychiatric care of PD patients warrants appreciation of the clinical presentation, biopsychosocial features, and treatment of cognitive impairment.

      "abstract": "Non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD), such as excessive daytime sleepiness, 'sleep attacks', insomnia, restless legs syndrome and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, are common and provide a challenge to treatment. These sleep symptoms are also described in patients suffering from the sleep/wake disorder, narcolepsy. The International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD-2) narcolepsy criteria uses a number of markers for diagnosis, of which lack or deficiency of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) hypocretin-1 levels is a key marker. Hypocretin neurons prominently located in the lateral hypothalamus and perifornical nucleus have been proposed to interact with mechanisms involving sleep and arousal. Low hypocretin-1 levels in the CSF have been shown to correlate with hypothalamic hypocretin cell loss in narcolepsy and other forms of hypersomnia; therefore, it has been proposed that degenerative damage to hypocretin neurons (such as in PD) may be detected by low CSF hypocretin-1 concentrations, and may also explain the sleep symptoms experienced by some PD patients. To date, there is mixed conflicting data describing hypocretin-1 levels in the CSF of patients with parkinsonism associated with sleep symptoms, with most studies showing no significant decrease when compared with controls. However, hypocretin-1 CSF deficiency has been shown in some studies to be more prominent in PD patients with sleep symptoms versus those without. Notably, the hypocretin system has been shown not to be selectively disrupted, with one study showing melanin concentrating hormone cell loss in the same patients with hypocretin loss. It is likely that hypocretin deficiency in PD patients occurs secondary to collateral damage caused by the neurodegenerative process involving the hypothalamus. Awareness of narcoleptic events in PD is important for driving related advice, in addition to the possible use of dopamine D3 receptor active agonists.",

PD involves the whole body and begins with gastrointestinal lesions, which do not start in the midbrain substantia nigra, but from the beginning of the medulla oblongata of the glossopharyngeal nerve nuclei, to the motor nerve dorsal nucleus of the vagus nerve, to the pons and midbrain, and finally to the neocortex. The human eye, ear, nose, tongue, and body perceive the external world. (1) Visual impairment in patients with PD can be easily confused with senile eye disease. This change in retinal pigment cells has many similarities to the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra in PD. (2) Selective high-frequency hearing impairment can cause a certain degree of communication barriers, only understanding the son’s bass but not the daughter’s soprano, and there is a certain relationship between hearing and body postural balance. (3) Olfactory loss is one of the earliest signs of PD and an important indicator for the early screening of PD. (4) Taste disorders, including loss of taste and taste memory, can cause cognitive impairment. (5) The body’s sense of touch, pressure, pain, temperature, and position abnormalities interfere with the motor symptoms of PD and seriously affect the quality of life of patients.

It is also not unusual for other neurological problems, such as epilepsy, to complicate the picture. The question is always whether the intellectual problems are due to a static defect, or are part of a progressive neurodegenerative disorder. Many conditions declare themselves with the passage of years. However, a small but significant group of conditions are sufficiently indolent in their progress to cause no obvious deterioration until late adolescence or adulthood. In this situation, a parent or carer may ask the adult neurologist to assess whether the perceived decline in functioning is real, and if so, what the cause is. This situation is often far from clear-cut, and so I will try and provide some guidance for when this difficult diagnostic problem arises.

Hallucinations are a significant symptom of PDP, sporadic at first but more frequent in the later course of the disease, and significantly disrupt daily activities. Appropriate and timely screening of psychotic manifestations is necessary for adequate therapeutic procedures. After the exclusion of comorbid conditions as a possible cause of psychosis, correction of antiparkinsonian therapy may be required, and if necessary, the introduction of antipsychotics.

      "title": "Natural Neuroprotectives for the Management of Parkinson's Disease",
      "abstract": "Neurodegeneration is an umbrella term for the progressive loss of structure and/or function of neurons along with destruction of nerve cells. Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most general neurodegenerative disorder that involves a decreased nigrostriatal availability of dopamine, resulting in motor impairment including bradykinesia, rigidity, and tremor. Currently, the exact cause of PD is unclear with no single factor accountable for neurodegeneration. It shows that several factors may contribute to its development, such as formation of reactive oxygen species, protein misfolding, and neuroinflammation. The deficiency of dopamine occurs due to loss of dopaminergic neurons and degradation of dopamine. Free radicals are generated after the degradation of dopamine and contribute to neurodegeneration. The body has various endogenous antioxidants, but when the level of free radicals is too high due to their overproduction, these endogenous antioxidants are unable to scavenge them, and oxidative stress takes place. Many dopamine-replenishing drugs have been developed to minimize the PD-associated motor deficits although they produce symptomatic relief only and fail to prevent disease progression. Increasing evidence that oxidative stress is critically involved in the pathogenesis of PD suggests that pharmacological targeting of the antioxidant machinery may have therapeutic value. These findings strongly suggest consideration of natural antioxidants or neuroprotectives as an intervention in PD. Many experimental reports have shown the role of natural neuroprotectives such as coenzyme Q10, vitamin E, curcumin, naringenin, melatonin, and vitamin C in the prevention and management of PD. Coenzyme Q10 protects mitochondria and dopaminergic neurons from reactive oxygen species. This provides neuroprotective therapy in PD. Vitamin E is an antioxidant that helps to avoid oxidation of brain lipids. Similarly to tocopherol, ascorbic acid is a free radical scavenger besides aiding in the regeneration of tocopherol. Curcumin, naringenin, and melatonin are antioxidants, with curcumin additionally having the potential to inhibit monoamine oxidase B. This chapter will deal with the literature covering the use of various natural neuroprotective agents that may find application in PD. This chapter will also focus on the mechanism of actions and in vitro and in vivo application of natural neuroprotectives in experimental animal models and in patients with PD.",

Nonmotor manifestations of PD play a significant role in the impairment of disease-related quality of life. The cause of nonmotor manifestations of PD is multifactorial, but to a large extent, these manifestations are related to the nature of the neurodegenerative process and the widespread nondopaminergic neuropathological changes associated with the disease. Recognition of nonmotor disability is essential not only for ascertaining the functional status of patients but also for better appreciating the nature of the neurodegenerative process in PD. In addition, a number of nonmotor manifestations can precede the onset of motor symptoms in PD and can be used as screening tools allowing for early disease identification and for trials of possible disease-modifying interventions.

      "title": "Clinical Study on the Incidence of Pain in Parkinson's Disease",
      "abstract": "This study focuses on the diagnosis and management of pain in Parkinson’s disease. Separating Parkinson’s disease related pain from pain of other origin is very difficult. They all come under one umbrella among the different forms of Parkinson’s disease related pain, musculoskeletal pain is the most common form accounting for 40% in PD. Pain occurs in about 60% of Parkinson’s disease patients, two to three times more frequent in this population than in age matched healthy individuals. It is an early and potentially disabling symptom that can precede motor symptoms by several years. The lower back and lower extremities are the most commonly affected areas. The most used classification for pain in PD defines musculoskeletal, dystonic, central, or neuropathic/radicular forms.\r\n\r\nIts different clinical characteristics, variable relationship with motor symptoms and inconsistent response to dopaminergic drugs suggest that the mechanism underlying pain in Parkinson’s disease is complex and multifaceted, involving the peripheral nervous system, generation and amplification of pain by motor symptoms and neuro-degeneration of areas related to pain.\r\n\r\nThe basal ganglion processes somatosensory information differently. Increased subjective pain sensitivity with lower electrical and heat pain threshold has been reported in Parkinson’s disease patients. The mechanism is assumed to be diminished activity of the descending inhibitory system of the basal ganglia. Promising perspectives for this have come from studies using different pain scales in Parkinson’s disease.\r\n\r\nSelection criteria- “King’s Parkinson’s disease pain scale,” which was proposed by a multicenter group that included King’s College Hospital in London, is officially advocated by the “International Parkinson’s and Movement Disorder Society Non-Motor PD Study Group” for evaluating pain in Parkinson’s disease treatment prevalence.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease is a neurological disorder, which is said to affect 4 million people in the world or more. The motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease can have an impact over the quality of life of the people affected, especially as the disease progresses and the symptoms worsen. Agitated paralysis (Parkinson’s disease) is a frequent disorder, described as involuntary quivering movement with diminished muscle strength of the parts of the body without tremor and even when the limb is supported with the trunk bending forward and proliferation and passage from walking to running, without intellectual impairment.\r\nThis paper’s objective was to highlight the fact that the Parkinson’s patient is among the persons requiring special attention both from their family, and the medical specialized staff. Persons suffering from this disorder are dependent on those around them, especially in the advanced stages of the disease, which is why early diagnosis is an important factor. The patients with Parkinson’s need help and understanding and must not be seen as a burden, since their handicap is involuntary.\r\nThis paper’s subject is the kinetic treatment of Parkinson’s disease. The general objective is to prepare a rehabilitation program, specially adapted to each person’s needs, depending on the stage of the disease and to provide both physical and moral support.\r\nRezumat\r\nBoala Parkinson este afecțiune neurologica, despre care se spune ca afecteaza 4 milioane de persoane din lume sau chiar mai mult. Simptomele motorii ale maladiei Parkinson pot avea un impact asupra calitații vieții persoanelor afectate, in special pe masura ce maladia evolueaza și simptomele se inrautațesc. Paralizia agitanta (Boala Parkinson) este boala frecventa, descrisa ca fiind o tremuratura involuntara cu diminuarea forței musculare, in parțile corpului fara tremuraturi și chiar când membrul este susținut, cu progresiune și inclinare a trunchiului inainte și trecere de la mers la fuga,  fara atingere intelectuala.\r\nAceasta lucrare are rolul de a evidenția faptul ca bolnavul de Parkinson se numara printre persoanele care necesita deosebita atenție atât din partea familiei cât și din partea personalului medical de specialitate. Persoanele care sufera de aceasta afecțiune sunt dependente de cei din jur, mai ales atunci când boala este intr-un stadiu destul de avansat, de aceea diagnosticarea precoce este un factor important. Bolnavul de Parkinson  trebuie ajutat și ințeles și nu trebuie considerat povara deoarcere handicapul lor este involuntar.\r\nSubiectul acestei lucrari âl constituie tratamentul kinetic al bolii Parkinson. Obiectivul general este de a elabora un program de recuperare, special adaptat pentru necesitațile fiecarui caz in parte in funcție de stadiul bolii și de a oferi sprijin atât fizic cât și moral.",

      "abstract": "Autoimmune polyendocrine syndromes (APS) are rare endocrinopathies characterized by the coexistence of at least two glandular autoimmune diseases. APS comprise a wide spectrum of autoimmune disorders and are divided into a very rare juvenile (APS type 1) and a more common adult type with (APS 2) or without adrenal failure (APS 3). The first clinical manifestations of APS 1 usually occur in childhood whereas APS 2 mostly occurs during the third and fourth decades of life. The third type has been described in adults that, contrary to types 1 and 2, does not involve the adrenal cortex. No clinical differences between types 2 and 3 have been described except the absence of adrenal failure. Type 4 APS is a rare syndrome characterized by the combination of autoimmune conditions not falling into the above categories. It consists of adrenal failure with one or more minor autoimmune disorders barring major components of type 1 and 2 APS. Usually, autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome of adults manifests itself as one of the major autoimmune diseases (such as adrenal failure, Grave's disease, or type 1 diabetes) and minor autoimmune disorders (vitiligo, alopecia) preceding the development of autoimmune deficiency of major endocrine glands. This article describes a patient with type 3 APS, who developed type 1 diabetes. Grave's disease and vitiligo. The development of the syndrome started from vitiligo in the chidhood. Moreover, the patient suffered primary sterility and presented with progressive diabetic nephropathy of autoimmune origin. It is concluded that patients with a single autoimmune component of polyendocrine syndrome should be screened to exclude other autoimmune endocrine disorders.",

Diese Beeinträchtigungen erklären sich sowohl aus der zugrundeliegenden Neuropathologie sowie der parkinson-assoziierten Neurotransmitter-Imbalancen als auch aus den mit dieser Erkrankung einhergehenden Alltagsveränderungen. Nach Gifford und Cummings [21] werden bis zu 75 Prozent der moderaten bis schweren Demenzfälle von Hausärzten nicht erkannt; bei leichten kognitiven Beeinträchtigungen und affektiv-emotionalen Problemen liegt die Zahl noch höher. Aufgrund der maskierenden Symptomatik der Parkinsonkrankheit kann angenommen werden, dass diese Zahlen bei dieser Patientengruppe wahrscheinlich höher liegen.

      "abstract": "Despite its imprecision, atypical parkinsonism is a useful clinical term. It unites a group of disorders linked by the predominant presence of bradykinesia, but where additional clinical features exclude Parkinson's disease (PD; hence the analogous but currently less-favored term Parkinson's plus). In most cases, disease progression is rapid and relentless and the response to dopaminergic drugs minimal or temporary. Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is the most common example among the primary neurodegenerations, but a substantial number of cases are found at autopsy to have neurofibrillary tangle degeneration, or a combination of neocortical and subcortical Lewy bodies. Extensive subcortical cerebrovascular disease without additional neurodegenerative pathological change is another relatively common cause, but one that presents considerable diagnostic difficulties in clinical practice. Because so many of these pathologies carry a grim and hopeless prognosis, the delicate nuance of uncertainty implicit within the term atypical parkinsonism may be preferable to a more precise alternative clinical label. Nonetheless, names given to neurological disorders assume great importance, both within the medical profession and for those individuals who acquire them: \"giving a name to the enemy,\" however baleful, is often greeted, at least initially, with a sense of relief—\"better the devil you know!\"",

Obgleich sie sehr häufig auftreten, werden sie bis heute allzu oft nicht angemessen wahrgenommen und therapiert. Die Gründe dafür sind u. a. in der Vielfältigkeit der Schmerzen und in der anspruchsvollen Differenzialdiagnostik zu suchen. Die Krankheit vereint unter dem Überbegriff Morbus Parkinson Schmerzen verschiedenster Art. In Analogie zum chronischen Schmerzsyndrom kann man jedoch 3 große Subgruppen unterscheiden: den neuropathischen, den nozizeptiven und den gemischten Schmerz (mixed pain). Die Pathophysiologie von Schmerzen bei Parkinson ist sehr komplex und in vielen Punkten noch unklar. Neue wissenschaftliche Erkenntnisse weisen auf eine Dysfunktion der Basalganglien bei der Entstehung, Weiterleitung und Verarbeitung von Schmerzen hin. Schmerzen können bereits in der präsymptomatischen Krankheitsphase auftreten und der motorischen Symptomatik vorausgehen, oder aber sie treten in Analogie zu den motorischen Krankheitssymptomen nach Diagnosestellung auf. Es gibt Schmerzen, die durch eine Optimierung der dopaminergen Medikation gelindert werden können, aber auch Schmerzen, die keine Response auf L-Dopa zeigen. Schmerzen, welche durch motorische Krankheitssymptome und Off-Phasen assoziiert auftreten, weisen auf eine notwendige Optimierung der dopaminergen Medikation hin. Botulinumtoxin hat sich in der Therapie fokaler Dystonien bewährt. Kasuistisch wird über eine Besserung von Schmerzen und Dysästhesien nach tiefer Hirnstimulation berichtet. Nicht L-Dopa-responsive Schmerzen sollten einer multimodalen Schmerztherapie zugeführt werden, welche insbesondere auf mögliche Interaktionen mit Parkinson-Medikamenten Rücksicht nehmen sollte.",

PD is also the most common cause of parkinsonism, a clinical syndrome with a constellation of symptoms including bradykinesia, rigidity and resting tremor. The diagnosis of PD is based on a set of clinical criteria that focus on the motor signs of the disease [2]. However, diagnostic accuracy is only 90% even in the hands of movement disorders experts [3]. PD diagnosis is more prone to error early in the clinical course of the disease [4], even though the pathologic process leading to PD probably begins a decade or more before clinical signs are apparent. By the time patients are diagnosed, approximately 70–80% of striatal dopamine and over 50% of substantia nigra (SN) neurons have already been lost [5]. Likewise, monitoring PD progression and medication responses is also subject to error as it primarily relies on relatively coarse and somewhat subjective measures of motor performance.",

A doença de Parkinson é considerada uma enfermidade neurodegenerativa crônica e progressiva que limita a independência nas atividades funcionais e na qualidade de vida dos pacientes podendo causar uma série de desafios. Apresenta sintomatologia complicada, com disfunções de ordem motora, como fortes tremores de mãos, pés e corpo, rigidez muscular, alterações posturais, desequilíbrio, incontinência urinária, alterações na fala, entre outros. É caracterizada, também, por manifestações não motoras, como as sensitiva-sensoriais, autonômicas, afetivas, cognitivas, comportamentais e do sono, que poderão causar incapacidades e contribuir com a dependência do portador. A qualidade de vida atua como um indicador nos conceitos clínicos de doenças específicas por meio da avaliação do impacto físico e psicossocial que algumas enfermidades podem gerar, possibilitando assim um melhor conhecimento do paciente e de sua adaptação a determinada condição. Devido à possibilidade de incapacidade produzida pelos sintomas da doença, é fundamental a adoção de estratégias para melhorar a qualidade de vida dos portadores, como adoção de recursos terapêuticos complementares. Foi realizado um levantamento bibliográfico através de busca eletrônica de trabalhos científicos que nos possibilitou perceber que, devido ao caráter progressivo e degenerativo da doença é preciso que profissionais da área de saúde estejam atentos para conhecer e indicar maneiras adequadas para prevenir e minimizar os efeitos da enfermidade, proporcionando aos portadores manutenção/ melhoria qualidade de vida.",

      "title": "Triggers, Facilitators, and Aggravators: Redefining Parkinson’s Disease Pathogenesis",
      "abstract": "We propose a new conceptual model for PD pathogenesis, in which disease-associated factors are divided into three categories: triggers, facilitators, and aggravators. Triggers are agents or events that begin the disease process; these factors are necessary but insufficient for PD to develop. Facilitators are factors that allow the disease to spread to, and significantly impact, the central nervous system. Aggravators directly promote the neurodegenerative process and often have a snowballing effect that exacerbates pathology and spreads the disease beyond the basal ganglia. We propose that clinical therapies aimed at slowing or arresting PD progression should not only be given to patients enriched for the appropriate target (i.e., administered to the appropriate subpopulation), but also be applied during the appropriate temporal phase at which the relevant factor is most active. We hypothesize that Parkinson's disease (PD) pathogenesis can be divided into three temporal phases. During the first phase, 'triggers', such as viral infections or environmental toxins, spark the disease process in the brain and/or peripheral tissues. Triggers alone, however, may be insufficient, requiring 'facilitators' like peripheral inflammation for PD pathology to develop. Once the disease manifests, 'aggravators' spur further neurodegeneration and exacerbate symptoms. Aggravators are proposed to include impaired autophagy and cell-to-cell propagation of α-synuclein pathology. We believe clinical trials need to consider these three phases and target potential therapies at the appropriate stage of the disease process in order to be effective. We hypothesize that Parkinson's disease (PD) pathogenesis can be divided into three temporal phases. During the first phase, 'triggers', such as viral infections or environmental toxins, spark the disease process in the brain and/or peripheral tissues.

Once the disease manifests, 'aggravators' spur further neurodegeneration and exacerbate symptoms. Aggravators are proposed to include impaired autophagy and cell-to-cell propagation of α-synuclein pathology. We believe clinical trials need to consider these three phases and target potential therapies at the appropriate stage of the disease process in order to be effective. A crucial unmet need for patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) is a disease-modifying therapy. This is particularly urgent considering that the number of people with PD is set to double over the next 20 years, with over 14 million PD cases expected worldwide by 2040 [1Dorsey E.R. Bloem B.R. The Parkinson pandemic — a call to action.JAMA Neurol. 2018; 75: 9-10Crossref PubMed Scopus (395) Google Scholar]. We believe that an inadequate understanding of the relative relationship and temporal sequence of factors involved in PD pathogenesis might be hampering advances of new therapies. Many past attempts to develop therapies were designed with the aim of slowing disease progression by targeting single molecular pathways in PD pathogenesis; these attempts also typically viewed PD as a uniform disease, and subsequently treated all patients with the same therapeutic regimen. The PD research field is now questioning the accuracy of considering PD as a single entity. Instead it has been suggested that PD is in fact an umbrella term given to a large cluster of disorders encompassing a range of clinical, epidemiological, molecular, neuropathological, and genetic subtypes [2Espay A.J. et al.Precision medicine for disease modification in Parkinson disease.Nat. Rev. Neurol. 2017; 13: 119Crossref PubMed Scopus (94) Google Scholar, 3Espay A.J. et al.Biomarker-driven phenotyping in Parkinson's disease: a translational missing link in disease-modifying clinical trials.Mov. Disord. 2017; 32: 319-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (97) Google Scholar]. We would argue that if research programs culminate in clinical trials that continue to target a single pathogenic mechanism in groups of patients defined by the broad clinical diagnosis of PD, they are unlikely to yield effective disease-modifying treatment. We agree with the view that PD patients are a heterogenous population and, at best, patients can be grouped into different clusters with certain shared characteristics. In this opinion piece, we hypothesize that in a given patient, or patient cluster, the prevailing pathological mechanism will change during the different phases of PD. Based on this hypothesis, we propose a new conceptual model for PD pathogenesis. From the treatment perspective, the proposed model implies that medical interventions need to be disease-stage specific and personalized to maximize the chances of modifying the course of the disease. Specifically, our model first divides the factors that contribute to neurodegeneration into three categories: triggers, facilitators, and aggravators. Second, we argue that each of these factors play distinct roles at different stages of the disease. Triggers encompass factors that enable the initiation of the disease process. These are most prominent during the period of 'prodromal PD'. However, triggers alone are, in most cases, insufficient for PD to develop, as they require the presence of 'facilitators' for the disease to spread to, and significantly impact, the central nervous system. We propose that this applies not only to idiopathic PD, but also to familial forms of PD, as no known genetic form has complete penetrance, and the onset of PD symptoms in the familial forms are known to occur over a wide age span. We acknowledge that familial cases have a greater contribution of genetic factors as a facilitator event, compared with idiopathic PD. Facilitators can also be factors that sensitize cells to the toxic effects of triggers and promote a neurodegenerative cascade that may involve the formation and/or seeding of pathogenic α-synuclein. It would be necessary for these facilitators to be present during the initial stages of the disease process, when α-synuclein pathology transitions to the midbrain after initially being confined to a small number of cells in peripheral locations in the nervous system (e.g., enteric nerves) or central ones (e.g., olfactory system). Finally, we suggest a third category of factors that contribute to PD pathogenesis. These are 'aggravators', which directly promote the neurodegenerative process by exacerbating the pathology and promoting the spread of the disease beyond the basal ganglia. The phases where triggers, facilitators, and aggravators act do not necessarily have distinct boundaries; rather, they represent a continuum along the disease course. The proposed terminology, however, can be helpful as a conceptual framework for articulating more clearly when, across a process that typically lasts several decades, different factors act, and what are their key roles. We think our hypothesized framework will facilitate the development of selective therapies that target the right mechanism at the right time. We will use examples to illustrate how key biological mediators of PD pathophysiology can be divided into the three categories of triggers, facilitators, and aggravators (Figure 1), and we will examine when is it during the disease process that they are most likely to play a critical role in PD pathogenesis. With the exception of relatively rare genetic forms of PD, triggers of PD are largely unknown. Yet a number of suspected triggers have been inferred from endogenous functions of candidate PD risk genes, and from findings in experimental animals. In idiopathic PD, the triggers are thought to act decades before the loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic signaling has reached levels necessary for the onset of clinical motor symptoms [4Ross G.W. et al.Parkinsonian signs and substantia nigra neuron density in decendents elders without PD.Ann. Neurol. 2004; 56: 532-539Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar, 5Marsden C.D. Parkinson's disease.Lancet. 1990; 335: 948-952Abstract PubMed Scopus (0) Google Scholar]. We propose that triggers often act transiently, with the triggering event lasting a few weeks or months and occurring relatively early in the life of individuals that will develop PD. The transient nature of such triggers makes them particularly difficult to detect, and a thorough review of patient medical histories may be necessary to identify possible triggers. Several triggers of PD have already been proposed and include pathogens and environmental toxins, as well as head trauma (Table 1). Potential outcomes of triggering events may include long-term gut dysfunction [6Barreau F. Hugot J. Intestinal barrier dysfunction triggered by invasive bacteria.Curr. Opin. Microbiol. 2014; 17: 91-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar], chronic inflammation in critical tissues [7da Fonseca D.M. et al.Microbiota-dependent sequelae of acute infection compromise tissue-specific immunity.Cell. 2015; 163: 354-366Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (188) Google Scholar], or the direct misfolding of α-synuclein into pathogenic conformers (e.g., resulting from exposure to heavy metals) [8Uversky V.N. et al.Metal-triggered structural transformations, aggregation, and fibrillation of human α-synuclein a possible molecular link between Parkinson's disease and heavy metal exposure.J. Biol. Chem. 2001; 276: 44284-44296Crossref PubMed Scopus (926) Google Scholar]. Two anatomical sites have been suggested to be of particular relevance as places of origin for PD pathology. In 2003, Braak and colleagues first proposed that the olfactory epithelium and intestines might be where PD begins [9Braak H. et al.Staging of brain pathology related to sporadic Parkinson's disease.Neurobiol. Aging. 2003; 24: 197-211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7188) Google Scholar]. This was based on the histological observation of α-synuclein aggregates in these sites in very early stage PD, and even in cases presumed to be prodromal PD [9Braak H. et al.Staging of brain pathology related to sporadic Parkinson's disease.Neurobiol. Aging. 2003; 24: 197-211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7188) Google Scholar]. Gastrointestinal dysfunction and hyposmia are core features of PD, often occurring years to decades before the emergence of motor symptoms [10Schapira A.H. et al.Non-motor features of Parkinson disease.Nat. Rev. Neurosci. 2017; 18: 435-450Crossref PubMed Scopus (777) Google Scholar]. Their involvement in the early symptoms of PD, together with the findings of α-synuclein aggregates in these tissues [9Braak H. et al.Staging of brain pathology related to sporadic Parkinson's disease.Neurobiol. Aging. 2003; 24: 197-211Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (7188) Google Scholar], indicate that the gastrointestinal tract and olfactory system might be trigger sites in PD pathogenesis. Below, we will use pathogens and microbiome changes, as well as pesticides and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), as illustrative examples of potential triggers.Table 1Examples of Triggers Proposed to Spark the PD Pathogenic ProcessTriggersExamplesRefsGastrointestinal microbiota perturbationsIncreased LactobacillusReduced Prevotella21Sun M.F.

Even common gastrointestinal infections, such as norovirus, induce upregulation of α-synuclein in the gastrointestinal tract, potentially in an effort to rally an immune response [11Stolzenberg E. et al.A role for neuronal alpha-synuclein in gastrointestinal immunity.J. Innate Immun. 2017; 9: 456-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar]. Aggregated α-synuclein is present in the enteric nervous system in PD patients [12Barrenschee M. et al.Distinct pattern of enteric phospho-alpha-synuclein aggregates and gene expression profiles in patients with Parkinson's disease.Acta Neuropathol. Commun. 2017; 5: 1Crossref PubMed Scopus (66) Google Scholar], but it has also more recently been shown to occur in healthy people, indicating that α-synuclein aggregates in the gut are not specific to PD [13Chung S.J. et al.Alpha-synuclein in gastric and colonic mucosa in Parkinson's disease: limited role as a biomarker.Mov. Disord. 2016; 31: 241-249Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar, 14Killinger B.A. et al.The vermiform appendix contributes to the development of Parkinson's disease.Sci. Transl. Med. 2018; (in press)Crossref PubMed Scopus (161) Google Scholar]. We propose that aggregation of α-synuclein in the gut is not necessarily abnormal per se, and is most often part of an appropriate, self-contained inflammatory response following infection. We speculate that what differentiates those who develop PD from those who do not might be the presence of facilitators (see later) that amplify the α-synuclein aggregates and allow for their spread along the vagus nerve, eventually causing seeding in the brainstem and Lewy pathology in the central nervous system. Several studies have reported changes in gut microbiota in PD, including increases in Lactobacillus, Akkermansia, and Bifidobacterium, and decreases in Prevotella, Blautia, and Faecalibacterium [15Scheperjans F. The prodromal microbiome.Mov. Disord. 2018; 33: 5-7Crossref PubMed Scopus (18) Google Scholar]. The majority of these studies suffer from the confounder that anti-parkinsonian medication might change the gut microbiome [16Bedarf J.R. et al.Functional implications of microbial and viral gut metagenome changes in early stage L-DOPA-naïve Parkinson's disease patients.Genome Med. 2017; 9: 39Crossref PubMed Scopus (310) Google Scholar]. However, unmedicated patients with rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder who exhibit a high conversion rate to PD display similar changes in the gut microbiota [17Heintz-Buschart A. et al.The nasal and gut microbiome in Parkinson's disease and idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder.Mov. Disord. 2018; 33: 88-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar]. This supports the idea that microbiota alterations occur in prodromal and early PD. Moreover, α-synuclein-overexpressing mice exposed to the microbiota from PD patients display exacerbated motor dysfunction compared with those that received microbiota from healthy donors, supporting perturbation of gut microbiota as a potential PD trigger [18Sampson T.R. et al.Gut microbiota regulate motor deficits and neuroinflammation in a model of Parkinson's disease.Cell. 2016; 167: 1469-1480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1794) Google Scholar]. While all of the aforementioned studies have focused on the gut microbiome, it is possible that analogous changes in the nasal microbiome trigger α-synuclein aggregation in the olfactory bulb. Though studies of the nasal microbiome in PD are yet to yield any convincing differences [17Heintz-Buschart A. et al.The nasal and gut microbiome in Parkinson's disease and idiopathic rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder.Mov. Disord. 2018; 33: 88-98Crossref PubMed Scopus (291) Google Scholar, 19Pereira P.A. et al.Oral and nasal microbiota in Parkinson's disease.Parkinsonism Relat. Disord. 2017; 38: 61-67Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (108) Google Scholar], even if present, one should note that such suggested changes might only be present transiently during the prodrome. We speculate that a localized effect of altered microbiota causing inflammation leads to α-synuclein aggregation in enteric nerves or the olfactory system, with propagation of pathology to more central locations. Thus, gut dysbiosis and/or small intestinal bacterial overgrowth, along with increased intestinal permeability, can cause systemic inflammation, which could spread to the central nervous system through systemic circulation and several neural pathways [20Duerkop B.A. et al.Immune responses to the microbiota at the intestinal mucosal surface.Immunity. 2009; 31: 368-376Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (315) Google Scholar]. The downstream effects of gastrointestinal dysbiosis could be mediated by endogenous inflammatory factors or by metabolites directly produced by the gut bacteria [21Sun M.F. Shen Y.Q. Dysbiosis of gut microbiota and microbial metabolites in Parkinson's disease.Ageing Res. Rev. 2018; 45: 53-61Crossref PubMed Scopus (191) Google Scholar]. Metabolites secreted from gut bacteria that have been proposed to impact glial biology and neuroinflammation include short chain fatty acids and tryptophan metabolites [18Sampson T.R. et al.Gut microbiota regulate motor deficits and neuroinflammation in a model of Parkinson's disease.Cell. 2016; 167: 1469-1480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1794) Google Scholar]. Microbiome metabolites have been shown to induce microglia activation and motor deficits in α-synuclein transgenic mice [18Sampson T.R. et al.Gut microbiota regulate motor deficits and neuroinflammation in a model of Parkinson's disease.Cell. 2016; 167: 1469-1480Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (1794) Google Scholar]. Such metabolites may modify brain activities by regulating peripheral immune cell function and/or through activation of the vagal nerve either directly (e.g., evoke nerve responses) or indirectly (e.g., through enteroendocrine cell signaling) [22Bonaz B. et al.The vagus nerve at the interface of the microbiota-gut-brain axis.Front. Neurosci. 2018; 12: 49Crossref PubMed Scopus (480) Google Scholar]. Epidemiological studies have linked pesticide exposure with increased PD risk. A recent meta-analysis reported that exposure to several common pesticides is associated with ≥50% increased risk for developing PD [23Gunnarsson L.G. Bodin L. Parkinson's disease and occupational exposures: a systematic literature review and meta-analyses.Scand. J. Work Environ. Health. 2017; 43: 197-209Crossref PubMed Scopus (38) Google Scholar]. Furthermore, it is plausible that exposure to more than one pesticide confers an even greater risk compared with exposure to any individual chemical [24Wang A. et al.Parkinson's disease risk from ambient exposure to pesticides.Eur. J. Epidemiol. 2011; 26: 547-555Crossref PubMed Scopus (239) Google Scholar]. In principle, pesticides could trigger PD pathogenesis via several possible mechanisms, including inhibiting mitochondrial complex I, inducing oxidative stress, stimulating inflammation, and causing α-synuclein fibrillization [25Baltazar M.T. et al.Pesticides exposure as etiological factors of Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases—a mechanistic approach.Toxicol. Lett. 2014; 230: 85-103Crossref PubMed Scopus (256) Google Scholar]. Human dopaminergic neurons carrying the SNCA-A53T mutation develop impaired anterograde mitochondrial transport when exposed to regulated and approved pesticides [26Stykel M.G. et al.Nitration of microtubules blocks axonal mitochondrial transport in a human pluripotent stem cell model of Parkinson's disease.FASEB J. 2018; 32: 5350-5364Crossref PubMed Scopus (27) Google Scholar]. Exposure at these low levels caused impairment only in neurons carrying the PD mutation, supporting our concept that triggers (e.g., pesticides) need to be accompanied by a facilitator (e.g., PD risk mutation) to render neurons vulnerable to disease. Intravenous injection of the neurotoxin MPTP (e.g., through use of the synthetic analgesic drug MPPP when accidentally contaminated with MPTP) causes rapid death of nigral dopamine neurons and, consequently, PD symptoms [27Langston J.W. et al.Chronic parkinsonism in humans due to a product of meperidine-analog synthesis.Science. 1983; 219: 979-980Crossref PubMed Scopus (3954) Google Scholar]. However, the very acute nature of MPTP-induced parkinsonism limits its relevance to understanding familial or idiopathic PD. Furthermore, in the few individuals who injected MPTP intravenously and developed PD symptoms, the dose of the trigger (MPTP) was presumably so large that it overrode the need for a facilitator. Notably, not all people who injected MPTP developed parkinsonism and over 30 years ago, four cases exposed to MPTP intravenously were found to have reduced 6-fluorodopa uptake on positron emission scans, but no clinical signs of PD [28Calne D. et al.Positron emission tomography after MPTP: observations relating to the cause of Parkinson's disease.Nature. 1985; 317: 246Crossref PubMed Scopus (268) Google Scholar]. This suggests that the trigger in this case (MPTP) does not always cause significant nigral neurodegeneration, possibly due to the absence of appropriate facilitators or to a lower dose being injected. While MPTP-induced parkinsonism might be illustrative of the interrelationship between a trigger and its facilitators, the relevance to aggravators in idiopathic PD is probably limited because MPTP toxicity does not induce pathological hallmarks of PD-like Lewy bodies [29Masilamoni G.J. Smith Y. Chronic MPTP administration regimen in monkeys: a model of dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic cell loss in Parkinson's disease.J. Neural Transm. 2018; 125: 337-363Crossref PubMed Scopus (40) Google Scholar]. We define facilitators as factors that help triggers access the nervous system or spread the pathology to more central parts of the nervous system. We propose that the facilitator role in disease pathogenesis takes place concomitantly with the triggering event or after it, usually during the prodromal or asymptomatic phase of PD. Notably, facilitators and aggravators can either be permanent (e.g., in the form of a genetic predisposition) or transient, such as in the case of temporary gastrointestinal inflammation. PD development may depend on the simultaneous or proximal occurrence of the trigger and the facilitator; however, it is also conceivable that a trigger precedes the actions of a facilitator by several years. For example, pathogen-induced (trigger) inflammation in the gut resulting in localized α-synuclein accumulation and aggregation in enteric nerves [11Stolzenberg E. et al.A role for neuronal alpha-synuclein in gastrointestinal immunity.J. Innate Immun. 2017; 9: 456-463Crossref PubMed Scopus (168) Google Scholar] may not promote PD until years later, after an age-related decline in cellular energy homeostasis and lysosomal function (facilitators) has set in, which in turn could enable the propagation of α-synuclein aggregates to the brainstem. Inflammation in PD is present both in the periphery (systemic inflammation) and in the central nervous system [30Macchi B. et al.Inflammatory and cell death pathways in brain and peripheral blood in Parkinson's disease.CNS Neurol. Disord. Drug Targets. 2015; 14: 313-324Crossref PubMed Scopus (69) Google Scholar]. Genome-wide studies further revealed several polymorphisms in inflammatory genes associated with PD [31Hamza T.H. et al.Common genetic variation in the HLA region is associated with late-onset sporadic Parkinson's disease.Nat. Genet. 2010; 42: 781Crossref PubMed Scopus (592) Google Scholar, 32Chang D. et al.A meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies identifies 17 new Parkinson's disease risk loci.Nat. Genet. 2017; 49: 1511Crossref PubMed Scopus (633) Google Scholar, 33Pierce S. Coetzee G.A. Parkinson's disease-associated genetic variation is linked to quantitative expression of inflammatory genes.PLoS One. 2017; 12e0175882Crossref PubMed Scopus (33) Google Scholar]. At the molecular level, inflammatory mediators are known to promote α-synuclein misfolding and aggregation [34Gao H.-M. et al.Neuroinflammation and oxidation/nitration of α-synuclein linked to dopaminergic neurodegeneration.J. Neurosci. 2008; 28: 7687-7698Crossref PubMed Scopus (336) Google Scholar]. Importantly, there are also emerging, compelling links between inflammation and the spread of α-synuclein pathology, which could explain how systemic inflammation facilitates the propagation of α-synuclein pathology from peripheral tissues to the central nervous system [35Tyson T. et al.Sorting out release, uptake and processing of alpha-synuclein during prion-like spread of pathology.J. Neurochem. 2016; 139: 275-289Crossref PubMed Scopus (63) Google Scholar]. Notably, colon biopsies from PD patients exhibit increased mRNA levels for proinflammatory cytokines and glial markers, indicative of enteric inflammation [36Devos D. et al.Colonic inflammation in Parkinson's disease.Neurobiol. Dis. 2013; 50: 42-48Crossref PubMed Scopus (371) Google Scholar]. Furthermore, patients with inflammatory bowel disease have a higher incidence of PD [37Peter I. et al.Anti–tumor necrosis factor therapy and incidence of Parkinson disease among patients with inflammatory bowel disease.JAMA Neurol. 2018; 75: 939-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar, 38Villumsen M. et al.Inflammatory bowel disease increases the risk of Parkinson's disease: a Danish nationwide cohort study 1977–2014.Gut. 2018; (Published online May 21, 2018)https://doi.org/10.1136/gutjnl-2017-315666Crossref Scopus (163) Google Scholar, 39Lin J.C. et al.Association between Parkinson's disease and inflammatory bowel disease: a nationwide Taiwanese retrospective cohort study.Inflamm.

Bowel Dis. 2018; (Published online May 16, 2018)https://doi.org/10.1093/ibd/izy190Crossref Scopus (84) Google Scholar], which is substantially reduced by early exposure to anti-inflammatory, antitumor necrosis factor therapy [37Peter I. et al.Anti–tumor necrosis factor therapy and incidence of Parkinson disease among patients with inflammatory bowel disease.JAMA Neurol. 2018; 75: 939-946Crossref PubMed Scopus (185) Google Scholar]. Systemic inflammation in PD is reflected by elevated serum IL-6, TNF-α, and C-reactive protein, which are associated with severity or faster decline of motor symptoms [41Williams-Gray C.H. et al.Serum immune markers and disease progression in an incident Parkinson's disease cohort (ICICLE-PD).Mov. Disord. 2016; 31: 995-1003Crossref PubMed Scopus (145) Google Scholar]. In addition, there is an increased risk for PD among people who develop type 2 diabetes, especially at younger ages (25–44 years) [42De Pablo-Fernandez E. et al.Association between diabetes and subsequent Parkinson disease: a record-linkage cohort study.Neurology. 2018; (Published online June 13, 2018)https://doi.org/10.1212/WNL.0000000000005771Crossref PubMed Scopus (127) Google Scholar]. Since type 2 diabetes is coupled with systemic inflammation, this might suggest a facilitating role for inflammatory changes in those who happen to be exposed to disease triggers. Furthermore, general immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory treatments reduce the risk of developing PD [43Racette B.A. et al.Immunosuppressants and risk of Parkinson disease.Ann. Clin. Transl. Neurol. 2018; 5: 870-875Crossref PubMed Scopus (48) Google Scholar]. Taken together, systemic inflammation itself, and several chronic conditions that feature increased inflammation, might be cons",

      "title": "Early Degeneration of Both Dopaminergic and Serotonergic Axons – A Common Mechanism in Parkinson’s Disease",
      "abstract": "Motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) are tightly linked to the degeneration of substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons and their projections into the striatum. Moreover, a broad range of non-motor symptoms like anxiety and depression frequently occur in PD, most likely related to the loss of serotonergic neurons and their projections into corresponding targets. Strikingly, nigral dopaminergic neurons and raphe serotonergic neurons are severely affected in PD showing characteristic hallmarks of PD neuropathology, in particular alpha-synuclein containing Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites. So far, the initial events underlying neurodegenerative processes in PD are not well understood. Several observations, however, indicate that neurites and synapses of diseased neurons may be the first subcellular compartments compromised by alpha-synuclein associated pathology. In particular axonal pathology and deficits in axonal transport may be leading to the onset of synucleinopathies such as PD. This review will highlight current findings derived from imaging and neuropathological studies in PD patients, as well as cellular and animal PD models, which define the initial underlying structural and molecular events within dopaminergic and serotonergic circuits leading to the 'dying back' degeneration of axonal projections in PD.",

      "abstract": "The causes of pain in early/moderate Parkinson's disease (PD) are not well understood. Although peripheral factors such as rigidity, reduced joint movements and poor posture may contribute towards the development of pain, central mechanisms including altered nociceptive processing may also be involved.We performed a large clinical study to investigate potential factors contributing towards pain in early/moderate PD. We recruited 1957 PD participants who had detailed assessments of pain, motor and non-motor symptoms. The King's Parkinson's Pain scale was used to quantify different subtypes of pain.85% of participants reported pain (42% with moderate to severe pain). Pain influenced quality of life more than motor symptoms in a multiple regression model. Factors predicting overall pain severity included affective symptoms, autonomic symptoms, motor complications, female gender and younger age, but not motor impairment or disease duration. There was negligible correlation between the severity of motor impairment and the severity of musculoskeletal or dystonic pain as well as between the severity of OFF period motor problems and the severity of OFF period pain or OFF period dystonic pain. Features of central sensitization, including allodynia and altered pain sensation were common in this population. The use of drugs targeting central pain was very low.Pain in early/moderate PD cannot be explained by peripheral factors. Central causes may play a much more important role than previously considered. These results should lead to a major shift in the investigation and management of this common and disabling symptom.",

There is circumstantial evidence that this is also true in humans. Since a reduced ability to experience pleasure or reward (i.e. anhedonia) is a cardinal feature of clinical depression, and since the mesolimbic and mesocortical dopamine projections have been shown to degenerate in Parkinson’s disease, it is suggested that damage to these reward-related systems may contribute directly to the high incidence of depression that has been reported in this disease.",

The negative motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease are considered to give the greatest clue to normal function of this region of the brain. Particular attention is given to disorders of movement. These include delayed initiation and slowed execution of simple fast movements, due to abnormal specification of initial agonist activity. This might compromise predictive motor action, but this is shown to be preserved in Parkinson's disease. Disorders of more complex movements, such as repetitive, concurrent and sequential motor actions, are also abnormal in Parkinson's disease. These various defects are discussed in terms of a motor strategy involving the selection and sequencing of motor programmes to form a motor plan, and the initiation and execution of that motor plan. On the evidence available, it is suggested that patients with Parkinson's disease are unable to automatically execute learnt motor plans.",

Based on the National Center for Sleep Disorders Research Classification,5 insomnia symptoms can be defined as subjective complaints of difficulty falling asleep, difficulty maintaining sleep, early awakening and non refreshing sleep despite an adequate opportunity to sleep. An important consideration is whether the presence of one or more of these symptoms causes significant impairment to the patient’s social, occupational or other important areas of functioning. Insomnia can be due to primary or secondary causes. Primary insomnia refers to insomnia that appears to be unrelated to any identifiable underlying medical or psychiatric disorder.6,7 Secondary causes of insomnia include conditions where another disorder contributing to or aggravating the insomnia can be diagnosed (Table1). The diagnosis of sleep disorders is often based on obtaining a detailed sleep history, a neuropsychiatric evaluation, a physical examination looking for medical and other disorders, mental status examination and relevant investigations. A sleep diary that the patient maintains in which sleep-relevant behaviours such as bedtime and waking times, awakenings, total sleep time, napping, medications, alcohol and mood on waking often provides valuable information for the patient and physician. Patients with sleep-disordered breathing, sleep-related motor disorders and those with severe, chronic insomnia for which an obvious cause cannot be found may require referral for sleep laboratory evaluation.

A 73-year-old, previously healthy woman began to have memory problems (e.g., forgetful, forgetting to turn lights off, forgetting neighbors’ names) and infrequent delusional episodes (e.g., thinking that someone had stolen her wallet) for which she saw a general physician, who referred her to a memory clinic. She was taking no drugs that might affect cognitive or motor function. She was alert but slightly nervous and irritable. Her speech was fluent, and cranial nerve examinations, including extraocular muscle movement and eyelids, produced normal results. Her posture, including her neck, was normal. She had no tremor, rigidity, or akinesia of the neck, hands, or feet. Her gait was slightly slow for her age. Sensory examinations were unremarkable. She scored 20 out of 30 (normal > 24) on the Mini-Mental state Examination (MMSE) and 8 out of 18 (normal > 16) on the Frontal Assessment Battery (FAB). Laboratory data were normal. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Figure 1A) and brain 99mTc- L,L-ethyl cysteinate dimer single-photon emission computed tomography showed no remarkable changes. Metaiodobenzylguanidine myocardial scintigraphy results were normal (heart to mediastinum ratio on delayed images 3.35, normal > 2.0).6 Although hippocampal atrophy was not remarkable, she was diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due possibly to Alzheimer's disease. She was referred back to the local clinic, where 5 mg/d donepezil hydrochloride was started. Two years later, she was referred to the memory clinic again because of slow, short-stepped gait with assistance that had begun 1 year before. On examination, her cognitive function had deteriorated: MMSE score 14, FAB score 5. Delusions were not significant. Cranial nerve examination showed supranuclear vertical gaze palsy and dysarthria. She had no retropulsion. She had rigidity in her neck and upper extremities and marked akinesia bilaterally. She had no signs of aphasia, apraxia, limb dystonia, or alien hands. Brain MRI showed atrophy of the midbrain tegmentum (humming-bird sign or emperor penguin sign)7 (Figure 1B), and she was diagnosed with PSP1, 2 and referred back to the local clinic with instructions that she needed 300 mg/d of levodopa/carbidopa for gait difficulty. At the first visit, she had MCI alone without motor disorder. At the second visit, 2 years later, she had vertical gaze palsy and axial rigidity and akinesia. She did not have classical corticobasal syndrome during the course of the disease. Repeated brain MRI revealed midbrain atrophy and neurological signs. No similar cases had been previously reported to the knowledge of the authors except for a schizophrenia-like case8 and two cases of behavioral changes.9, 10 At the first memory screening, The woman described herein had marked frontal executive dysfunction as assessed according to the FAB. Prominent frontal dysfunction is a feature of PSP but not of Alzheimer's disease.3 A pathological lesion might have started in the frontal cortex and caused her frontal executive dysfunction. In conclusion, an elderly woman with PSP who presented with MCI without motor disorder is reported. MCI can be listed as a premotor feature of PSP.

      "title": "Substance P and its tachykinin NK1 receptor: a novel neuroprotective target for Parkinson′s disease",
      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common motor neurodegenerative disorder affecting approximately 4 million people worldwide. Although PD presents primarily with motor dysfunction, non-motor symptoms including cognitive decline, mood disorders, reduced olfaction and constipation are also often present, with some of these non-motor symptoms even presenting prior to the onset of motor symptoms. It is well known that PD is largely caused by the gradual degeneration of dopaminergic neurons within the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), along with the presence of protein aggregates called Lewy bodies, which consist primarily of α-synuclein and are found in the cytoplasm of surviving neurons. This ongoing cell loss and Lewy body pathology is not confined to the SNc, but is also seen in other brain regions implicated in PD pathogenesis such as the locus ceruleus. Nonetheless, the cause of cell death in PD still remains somewhat elusive. Numerous secondary cell injury cascades have been linked to this progressive dopaminergic cell death, including inflammation, blood brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction, oxidative stress, glutamate excitotoxicity and mitochondrial dysfunction. Despite this, current PD treatment does not protect dopaminergic neurons but rather provides symptomatic benefit by replacing lost striatal dopamine (DA) either directly or by preventing its breakdown. The “gold-standard” treatment for PD is L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA), the precursor to DA, combined with a peripheral dopa decarboxylase inhibitor such as benseraside. Since its inception as a PD therapeutic over 50 years ago, L-DOPA has primarily been administered in a pulsatile manner. This type of L-DOPA delivery results in maladaptive changes to brain signaling pathways and expression of L-DOPA induced dyskinesia (LID), or involuntary abnormal movements. Unfortunately, all patients will develop LID at some stage throughout their treatment, which they often find much more debilitating than the motor symptoms they presented with at diagnosis. Current research is thus focused on developing novel neuroprotective therapies that aim to treat the underlying cause of the disease, as well discovering possible adjunct therapies to L-DOPA that inhibit the expression of LID without interfering with L-DOPA motor improvement. Our recent studies have identified the neuropeptide substance P (SP) and its tachykinin NK1 receptor (NK1-R) as novel neuroprotective targets for both ongoing dopaminergic degeneration and mild to moderate LID. Thus treatment with an NK1-R antagonist may provide a new PD therapeutic that shows particular efficacy in the early stages of PD and LID (Thornton and Vink, 2012; Thornton et al., 2014). Substance P and NK1-R are widely expressed throughout the peripheral and central nervous systems in primary sensory neurons or C-fibers, as well as on endothelial cells and inflammatory cells. They are expressed in particularly high levels within the SNc where SP-containing striatal projection neurons synapse with dopaminergic neurons to potentiate the release of striatal DA, normal levels of which are required for proper motor function. It is the death of dopaminergic neurons and the subsequent loss of dopaminergic drive in this system that results in the loss of nigral SP expression seen post-mortem, and in experimental models of PD where near total degeneration of dopaminergic neurons occurs. This contrasts to early PD where remaining dopamine neurons can maintain striatal DA levels. At this time, nigral SP expression is unaffected or even increased. Indeed in our studies, SP expression was elevated following treatment with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) in vitro, with a significant correlation between SP levels and cell death (Thornton et al., 2010). Similarly, SP expression was increased in rodents following intratstriatal injections of 6-OHDA as early as day 3 in the striatum and substantia nigra, which was prior to the onset of dopaminergic degeneration that began around day 7 post-lesion (Thornton and Vink, 2012). Moreover when intrastriatal 6-OHDA injections were combined with endogenous SP treatment, significantly greater dopaminergic degeneration and further loss of motor function was seen compared to vehicle treated animals. In contrast, combination treatment of an NK1-R antagonist with 6-OHDA prevented the increase in SP seen at day 21 post-6-OHDA, and protected dopaminergic neurons and improved motor function. These results suggest that SP may be important in the early stages of PD pathogenesis. This early increase of SP expression in PD may not only be due to a greater release from striatal projection neurons to maintain striatal DA levels, but may also be due to dopaminergic degeneration initiating neurogenic inflammation, a neurally elicited local inflammatory response. Neurogenic inflammation occurs in the setting of injury or inflammation, both of which are present in PD, and results in the release of SP and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) from C-fibers surrounding blood vessels. Calcitonin gene-related peptide, a potent vasodilator, facilitates recruitment of inflammatory mediators, whereas SP binds to NK1-R on endothelial cells of cerebral microvasculature to increase BBB permeability. Normally, the structure of the BBB confers low paracellular permeability because of specialized endothelial cells with low pinocytotic activity, and expression of interendothelial adheren and tight junctional proteins such as cadherins, claudins, occludin and junctional adhesion molecules. This structural arrangement ensures that the passage of substances through the cerebral microvasculature is highly controlled, which is vital to maintain neuronal homeostasis (Hawkins and Davis, 2005). Consequently, dysfunction of the BBB stimulates an unfavorable neuronal environment due to the presence of normally excluded proteins, ions, toxins, metals and cells. Increased permeability of the BBB has been observed in clinical and animal models of PD with decreased expression of the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein and increased extravasation of the serum protein albumin being reported (Kortekaas et al., 2005; Pisani et al., 2012). Whether these changes are due to increased protein transport or loss of structural proteins like claudin-5 or occludin remains to be elucidated. Of interest for PD pathogenesis is that the barrier is particularly weak surrounding the cerebral microvasculature of the substantia nigra, with dopaminergic neurons seeming to be more vulnerable to experimentally induced barrier dysfunction than other neuronal populations (Rite et al., 2007). This may be due to the increased basal level of oxidative stress in the SNc from the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) during normal DA metabolism, as oxidative stress can in itself induce BBB dysfunction and has been strongly linked to dopaminergic cell death. It is this abnormally high level of oxidative stress in the substantia nigra that has been attributed to the increased albumin to cerebrospinal fluid ratio seen in the healthy elderly compared to the young and healthy population. Therefore in PD, where age is the greatest risk factor, the BBB may, in part, already to be functioning incorrectly. This means that only minor changes to the cerebral environment are required to induce further impairment of the barrier and subsequent dopaminergic cell loss. BBB dysfunction is also thought to contribute to LID by facilitating the uncontrolled entry of L-DOPA from the blood into the brain parenchyma resulting in fluctuating endogenous DA levels. Interestingly, administration of L-DOPA re-instates the dopaminergic drive in the SP-DA positive feedback regulation, increasing nigral SP expression back to normal levels. In doing so, endogenous SP is once again available to induce barrier breakdown. Indeed, L-DOPA treatment has been observed to increase barrier permeability to albumin (Westin et al., 2006). Apart from a direct ability to increase BBB permeability through neurogenic inflammation, SP is also involved in angiogenesis. Formation of new blood vessels with immature BBB properties has been observed in experimental LID (Westin et al., 2006). Due to the lack of an effective barrier on these vessels, L-DOPA delivery to the brain is unregulated causing fluctuating endogenous DA levels and LID. Confirmation that SP may be involved in the onset of LID was first reported in our studies where NK-1R antagonist treatment prevented the onset of mild to moderate LID (Thornton et al., 2014). Although the exact mechanism of this protection was not studied, the reduced FosB levels suggested regulation of the D1-mediated basal ganglia signaling pathway and prevention of the maladaptive changes. This could have been partially due to the NK1-R antagonist stabilizing the barrier, resulting in regulated delivery of DA to striatal projections neurons (Thornton et al., 2014). This role for SP in the onset of LID was recently confirmed by Yang et al. (2015), who showed treatment with an NK1-R antagonist reduced LID in 6-OHDA lesioned rodents by preventing DA efflux and the subsequent increase in secondary messenger systems, Arc and Penk (Yang et al., 2015). Importantly, both studies confirmed that administration of the NK1-R antagonist did not interfere with L-DOPA induced improvement in motor function. This augurs well for the use of NK1-R antagonists as a novel adjunct therapy to L-DOPA in the treatment of PD. Along with its effects on endothelial cells and BBB permeability, SP can also directly interact with inflammatory cells by binding to NK1-R expressed on microglia, astrocytes and leukocytes resulting in mast cell degranulation and cytokine production. Interestingly, histamine, which is released during mast cell degranulation, has been associated with BBB breakdown and the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons (Liu et al., 2007). Inflammatory processes in PD are unfortunately self-perpetuating with dying neurons activating the resident immune cells, including microglia. In turn, microglia produce high levels of ROS including superoxide, reactive nitrogen species (RNS) and pro-inflammatory cytokines resulting in further degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. This results in a vicious cycle of ongoing cell death and chronic inflammation. Indeed chronic activation of microglia has been visualized using positron emission tomography in the midbrain of PD patients and is a consistent feature in animal models of PD. Inflammatory processes are exacerbated in PD by the infiltration of peripheral immune cells such as T-lymphocytes, which are able to enter through the dysfunctional barrier and release pro-inflammatory cytokines, thereby further activating resident immune cells. Indeed, CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells have been observed within the SN in both the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) model of PD and at postmortem, with CD4+ T cells linked to MPTP-induced dopaminergic neurodegeneration (Brochard et al., 2009). The release of pro-inflammatory factors from either resident or peripheral immune cells may also directly increase BBB permeability by changing the expression of tight junction proteins (as reviewed by Hawkins and Davis, 2005) thereby allowing further infiltration of unwanted substances that could influence neurodegeneration. These results suggest that BBB dysfunction and inflammation work in concert to exacerbate ongoing dopaminergic cell death. Our own studies examining the relationship between BBB dysfunction and inflammatory processes in the 6-OHDA intrastriatal model of PD have confirmed their association with dopaminergic cell death (Thornton and Vink, 2012). In these studies, progressive dopaminergic degeneration was associated with both albumin extravasation and increased numbers of resident inflammatory cells, with both barrier disruption and activated microglia peaking at day 14 post-lesion coincident with significant dopaminergic degeneration. Treatment with an NK1-R antagonist prevented the albumin extravasation, and was accompanied by a reduction in inflammation. Although peripheral immune cell infiltration was not directly measured in this study, ED-1, a marker of phagocytotic cells including activated microglia and peripheral blood-borne macrophages, was assessed. NK1-R antagonist treatment did cause a reduction in the number of nigral ED-1 positive cells, which could represent a reduction in the direct activation of microglia and/or prevention of peripheral blood-borne macrophage recruitment due to restoration of BBB integrity. In summary, SP-induced neurogenic inflammation may play an important role in the pathogenesis of PD, including LID, by increasing BBB permeability and subsequent peripheral immune cell infiltration, as well as activation of resident immune cells (Figure 1). These injury cascades not only directly contribute to the ongoing neurodegeneration of dopaminergic neurons in PD but can also exacerbate other secondary injury mechanisms such as oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Treatment with an NK1-R antagonist attenuated the progression of PD and significantly reduced the onset of LID, presumably by inhibiting multifactorial injury mechanisms involving SP and NK1-R. Blocking the effects of SP with a NK1-R antagonist therefore presents a potentially promising new avenue for neuroprotection in PD.Figure 1: Mechanisms by which SP-induced neurogenic inflammation is implicated in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease.SP is released from C-fibers surrounding substantia nigra cerebral microvasculature and from striatal projection neurons. SP binds to NK1-R on endothelial cells to increase BBB permeability, or to microglia causing a release of pro-inflammtory cytokines and ROS/RNS. This is turn can further increase BBB permeability, but also directly causes dopaminergic degeneration. The increase in BBB permeability allows T-lymphocyte infiltration, which promotes further activation of microglia and cytokine release.

Epilepsy is a chronic condition characterized by recurrent, unprovoked seizures due to abnormal electrical activity in the brain. The pathophysiology involves various factors, including genetic mutations, structural brain abnormalities, and neurotransmitter imbalances. Epidemiologically, epilepsy affects about 50 million people worldwide. Symptoms range from brief lapses in attention to severe convulsions. Diagnosis is primarily through clinical history, EEG, and neuroimaging. Treatment includes antiepileptic drugs, lifestyle modifications, and in some cases, surgery. Complications can include injury during seizures, cognitive impairment, and social stigma. Prevention involves managing risk factors like head injuries and infections. Parkinson’s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. The pathophysiology involves the accumulation of Lewy bodies and a decrease in dopamine production, leading to motor and non-motor symptoms. Epidemiologically, Parkinson’s disease affects about 1% of the population over 60. Symptoms include tremors, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability. Non-motor symptoms can include depression, sleep disturbances, and cognitive decline. Diagnosis is based on clinical evaluation, with imaging and response to dopaminergic therapy aiding in confirmation. Treatment focuses on symptomatic relief through medications like levodopa, dopamine agonists, and MAO-B inhibitors. Advanced cases may benefit from deep brain stimulation. Complications include worsening motor function, cognitive decline, and increased risk of falls. Prevention strategies are limited but may include lifestyle factors like regular exercise and a healthy diet to support overall brain health.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Depression is common in PD, occurring in up to one-half of the patients. Anxiety disorders may be as common as depression and the two are frequently co-existent. Parkinson plus syndrome (PPS) is a group of sporadic, neurodegenerative diseases of the central nervous system, less common and usually more severe than Parkinson’s disease. They are characterised by relatively rapid disease progression and the presence of features that are atypical for PD, such as early postural instability and dementia, severe autonomic failure, or pyramidal and cerebellar signs. Material and Methods: The study was conducted to assess the effect of duration in non-motor dysfunction in 60 patients with Parkinsonism including idiopathic Parkinson’s disease and Parkinson plus syndrome who attended either the outdoor services, or were admitted in the Neurology ward of our tertiary care centre, PGIMER &amp; Dr. RML Hospital, New Delhi, India. Results: PD patients had no correlation between cognition and duration of disease (p=0.079 with MMSE and p=0.145 with SCOPA COG) but had significant correlation between depression, sleep problems, pain and autonomic dysfunction with duration of disease (p=0.027, 0.008, 0.010 and 0.042 respectively). Conclusion: Early recognition and diagnosis of PD and PPS is important as treatment may improve quality of life in patients. Co-existence of non-motor dysfunctions in the disease significantly adds to the burden of disease and affects the quality of life.",

      "title": "Other extrapyramidal syndromes: parkinsonism-plus and other forms of secondary parkinsonism",
      "abstract": "There are numerous other causes of an extrapyramidal syndrome manifesting as parkinsonism apart from Parkinson's disease (see previous chapter). Traditionally, these are listed etiologically as shown in Table 34.1. In this list three broad groups emerge namely that referred to as the parkinsonism-plus syndromes (also called atypical parkinsonian syndromes), the symptomatic or secondary parkinsonian conditions and the hereditary/heredodegenerative disorders (Table 34.1). The parkinsonism-plus syndromes are so called because they are multisystem degenerations and have other features in addition to parkinsonism. This older classification, although useful, has its limitations because the divisions drawn are somewhat artificial and there is a fair amount of overlap in the disorders listed under the different subheadings. For example, additional clinical features can also be present in disorders in the two groups apart from the parkinson-plus disorders and it is being realized that a genetic basis may even underlie parkinsonian disorders thought to be sporadic like progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Great advances at the molecular, ultrastructural and genetic level are leading to a newer way of classifying many of these degenerative diseases affecting the basal ganglia causing extrapyramidal syndromes (Dickson, 1997; Spillantini, 1999). Many parkinsonian syndromes can now be viewed as being caused by the genetic or sporadic occurrence of diseases characterized on the basis of cytoskeletal pathology and staining of particular proteins, for example, alphasynucleinopathies where alpha-synuclein is present (Spillantini, 1999; Goedert, 2001) or taupathies wherein there is deposition of tau protein (Morris et al., 1999a). This way, many of the disorders listed in Table 34.1 can now be reclassified as shown in Tables 34.2 and 34.3 on a molecular basis. Thus PSP and corticobasal degeneration and the inherited condition of frontotemporal dementia parkinsonism as well as dementia pugilistica or encephalitislethargica from the secondary parkinsonism division are all grouped together as ‘taupathies’, while multiple system atrophy (MSA) and Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies go together as ‘alpha-synucleinopathies’ (Spillantini et al., 1998a).",

A total of 205 patients with idiopathic Parkinson’s disease and 17 patients with multiple system atrophy had been examined. The severity of disease in patients with multiple system atrophy was significantly higher than in patients with Parkinson’s disease. Fall, freezing when walking, swallowing disorders, autonomic disorders, intellectual impairment, and depression occurred significantly more often in patients with multisystem atrophy compared with patients with Parkinson’s disease. Unlike Parkinson’s disease, in which the vast majority of cases (97.84 %) excellent, good or moderate effect of antiparkinsonian drugs was noted, in most patients with multiple system atrophy (73.33 %) only minor therapeutic effect was observed. Rapidly progressive autonomic dysfunction (not associated with any comorbidity) that developed shortly (1–2 years) before Parkinson’s disease, as well as onset of the disease with postural reflex impairment can be some of the distinctive features of multiple system atrophy.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson s disease (PD) is caused by an abnormal degeneration of the dopamine producing cells in the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area. When PD advances, degeneration of the nigroestriatal tracts may expand and involve other pathways (mesolimbic and frontal), and also serotonergic and cholinergic systems. This degeneration leads to a multitude of motor and non motor behavioral disturbances.On the background of progressive degeneration, chronic levodopa and dopaminergic agonist administration may cause pulsatile non physiologic overstimulation of dopaminergic receptors. This may induce perturbations in limbic and frontal cortex structures and overstimulation of serotonergic, cholinergic and other neurotransmitter systems. These events are the basis of parkinsonian psychosis, perhaps in the setting of early dementia. The treatment of this psychosis is difficult. The reduction or withdrawal of dopaminomimetic agents may improve psychosis with worsening of parkinsonian disability. The recommended order to discontinue antiparkinsonian drugs, when is required, is anticholinergic, selegiline, amantadine and dopamine agonist. Levodopa should be reduced to a tolerable minimum to compensate the motor disturbances. At this point, it may be necessary to add an atypical neuroleptic such as clozapine, quetirapine or olanzapine to improve the symptomatology.More studies are needed to asses the relationship between parkinsonian psychosis and early dementia. Additional, the development of new drugs could be helpful to control these psychotic symptoms in PD without serious secondary effects.",

PD is mainly characterized by motor symptoms. As one of the most common motor problems in people with PD, gait dysfunction leads to not only a decrease in mobility, but also a reduction in quality of life for persons with PD. Further, disabling symptoms in PD are also manifested as non-motor features, including depression, anxiety and apathy, all of which has significant impact on overall quality of life. Thus, it is important to understand how psychological symptoms co-manifest along with motor symptoms in people with PD. In considering the co-occurrence, it is worth noting that these non-motor symptoms of PD occur in both early and advanced stages of the disease. This points to the possibility of utilizing psychological symptoms as key indicators to predicting movement disabilities spotting a potential PD patient. Therefore, understanding Parkinson\"s gait and non-motor symptoms together is essential for diagnosis and treatment for people with PD, providing important clinical implications to researchers and clinicians.",

The presence of tremor, asymmetry, cognitive decline, cerebellar abnormalities, and autonomic dysfunction helps to define the cause. Parkinson disease (PD) is the most common of the parkinsonian syndrome, and is defined by asymmetric resting tremor, bradykinesia, and rigidity. Patients with PD respond to levodopa in the early stages of the disease, but become less responsive and develop more drug-related side effects and disability as the disease progresses. Progressive supranuclear palsy usually presents with gait difficulty, and the key diagnostic clue is difficulty with downward saccadic eye movements. Multiple system atrophy may include cerebellar and autonomic features that overshadow the extrapyramidal ones. Corticobasal degeneration is an extrapyramidal disorder with cognitive and behavioral abnormalities including prominent limb apraxia. Parkinsonism may be related to drugs (particularly neuroleptic agents) or cerebrovascular disease.",

The few data in comorbid Parkinson cases seem to point to a rapid cycling pattern of bipolar symptoms. With regard to therapeutic intervention, the literature supports pramipexole for treatment of both Parkinson and depressive symptoms in bipolar depression. Lithium, the mood stabilizer of choice for treating manic states, is problematical for use in Parkinson patients because of its side effects.

Estas alteraciones en el movimiento pueden ser por pobreza o dificultad para realizar movimientos del tipo que se observa en la enfermedad de Parkinson idiopatica (parkinsonismos secundarios a farmacos), o tambien por exceso de movimiento con cuadros distonicos o coreicos agudos o cronicos. La causa por la cual los mismos farmacos provocan efectos aparentemente opuestos no se conoce bien, aunque se supone que factores individuales de farmacocinetica, farmacodinamica y sensibilidad de distintos tipos de subreceptores desempenan un papel esencial. Desarrollo. Se exponen, divididos en dos partes segun el trastorno sea hiper o hipocinetico, los grupos sindromicos mas frecuentes, asi como los farmacos mas habitualmente responsables de dichos cuadros. Los trastornos por exceso de movimiento mas frecuentes son la discinesia aguda, la acatisia y la discinesia tardia. El trastorno por escasez de movimiento es un cuadro parkinsoniano que puede ser indistinguible de la enfermedad de Parkinson idiopatica. Conclusion.

These symptoms include executive dysfunction and disorders of thought, such as hallucinations and psychosis. Such symptoms may go on to predict dementia related to PD, which involves amnestic dysfunction and is typically seen later in the disease. Cognitive symptoms are associated with dysfunction in cholinergic circuits, in addition to the abnormalities in the prefrontal dopaminergic system.

      "title": "Clinical differential diagnosis of parkinsonism",
      "abstract": "A complete history remains critical in establishing the correct diagnosis. The physician must inquire about medications, possible environmental exposures, and family history of neurological disease, including essential tremor, dominantly inherited spinal cerebellar ataxias, and dementia, as well as parkinsonism. Parkinsonism in the adolescent or young adult should never be assumed to be idiopathic PD until other causes have been ruled out. If the clinical features resemble PD in all respects and there is an affected sibling, than there is a good possibility that disease is caused by recessive mutations in the parkin gene. The absence of rest tremor makes the diagnosis of PD difficult. If the patient also failures to response to L Dopa, the diagnosis is in serious doubt. Patients should be reexamined with a close look for down-gaze paresis and facial dystonia (PSP), also static hypotension (MSA), bulbar dysfunction with truncal ataxia (MSA, SCA). Although postural instability is one of the cardinal features of PD, it is usually not prominent early in disease. When initial signs include postural instability out of proportion to other manifestations, the clinicians should look hard for other forms of parkinsonism. In particular, several parkinsonism-plus syndromes can present with postural instability in gait disorder, including PSP and MSA. Dementia at the onset of illness agues against PD, suggesting instead primary dementia with parkinsonian features. Forms of dementia with parkinsonian features include diffuse Lewy-body disease and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. Early cognitive changes are also common in PSP, which may misdiagnosed as Alzheimer's disease. Diffuse Lewy-body disease was until recently an underdiagnosed cause of dementia with parkinsonism, accounting for up to 20% of all dementia in the elderly. Although usually unilateral in onset, PD typically becomes bilateral within several years. A patient whose disease persists in a markedly asymmetric manner may have corticobasal degeneration or hemiparkinsonism-hemiatrophy. Clinical differential diagnosis can often be made easier by SPECT, PET, smelling tests, and brain parenchyma sonography, nevertheless history and results of neurological examination are still crucial in establishing the cause of parkinsonism.",

The finding of mild cognitive deficits is common in Parkinson's disease, such as reduced flexibility, psychomotor slowing, reduction in learning capacity and information retrieval, and disturbances in visuospatial tasks. The most prevalent cognitive disturbance is an impairment in visuospatial tasks, not necessarily related to the degree of motor disability. Dementia, when present early on in the course of the disease may suggest alternative diagnoses (Diffuse Lewy body dementia, Alzheimer's disease with extrapyramidal features, Fronto-temporal dementia, etc.), while in those cases in whom the dementing disorder develops at a later stage, it is assumed to be an integral part of the disease, albeit corresponding to variable pathogenetic mechanisms.",

      "abstract": "In addition to typical motor dysfunction (parkinsonism), diverse non-motor symptoms (NMS) are frequently observed in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD). Some NMS may antedate the diagnosis of PD. Examples of NMS include cognitive impairment, autonomic dysfunction, visual dysfunction, sleep abnormalities and psychiatric disorders. NMS are associated with wide-ranging abnormalities in extranigral dopaminergic systems and non-dopaminergic (e.g. cholinergic, noradrenergic, serotoninergic) systems. The type and severity of NMS vary based on age, disease severity and predominant motor symptoms. NMS can be disabling and reduce quality of life. Treatment of NMS can be challenging. Some NMS are helped by dopaminergic treatment, whereas others can be induced or exacerbated by treatments that help the motor dysfunction. Physicians should probe their PD patients about their NMS and address them for better care. Clinical trials should incorporate NMS as outcomes for more meaningful conclusions on the effect of treatments under investigation.",

      "title": "Insight across mental disorders: A multifaceted metacognitive phenomenon",
      "abstract": "There is now general agreement that lack of insight is not merely a fundamental aspect of delusions and hallucinations, or just a symptom of psychotic disorders but rather a multi-dimensional construct. Several different components of insight have been proposed and empirically examined during the last three decades, such as the ability to recognize that one has a mental illness, the capacity to relabel unusual mental events as pathological, the specific attribution of one's symptoms to having a mental illness, awareness of illness' consequences, and compliance with treatment.1 Insight impairment is an important prognostic factor in schizophrenia, impacting negatively on medication adherence, treatment outcome, and social functioning.2 Although largely investigated in schizophrenia and other psychoses, insight impairments are observed in many, if not all, mental disorders. Varying levels of awareness of mental illness and/or of specific symptoms are expected in patients with bipolar disorders, Alzheimer disease and other neurocognitive disorders, obsessive-compulsive (OCD) and related disorders.1,3 While in DSM-5 an \"insight\" specifier was incorporated for OCD, body dysmorphic and hoarding disorder, patients' insight has been found ranging from good to absent in other disorders, such as depressive disorders,4 eating disorders,5 and even specific6 and social7 phobias. Moreover, impaired insight is a common reason that many people with clinical depression or anxiety disorders never seek appropriate treatment and most of the people with addictions and personality disorders fail to recognize and address their problems even when the consequences are devastating: personal suffering, broken relationships, and physical health problems. Depending on the disorder and reflecting different conceptual approaches, many different terms are used to describe lack of insight, such as poor self-awareness, denial, anosognosia (mainly in neurological deficits, e.g. hemiplegia), ego-syntonic symptoms, or even self-deception. At any rate, as an aspect of self-knowledge, insight has psychological (defense mechanisms, coping strategies), social and cultural facets. On the other hand, the attitudes and behaviours towards one's illness are products of inference processes and therefore can be influenced by cognitive dysfunctions. Previous research in schizophrenia showed correlations between neurocognitive functions and insight measures but the strength of this association is rather weak.8 Social cognition may be a crucial cognitive determinant of impaired insight in schizophrenia. The correct attitude toward morbid change in oneself relies on the capacity to reflect upon self from the perspective of the other (i.e., \"to see ourselves as others see us\"). This capacity is clearly linked to the ability to understand mental states (e.g., beliefs, knowledge, and intentions) of others, that is, theory of mind or mentalizing. Recent research has shown that mentalizing deficits may substantially contribute to insight impairment in schizophrenia.9 This effect could be further examined in the broader context of patient's failures in metacognition, i.e. the general ability to think about thinking, and their relationships with insight impairment in schizophrenia. Mentalizing and introspection are closely related developmentally and it is yet unclear which one is the primary ability: we are able to understand others and then apply this understanding to ourselves or we are able to reflect on ourselves and then apply this reflection to others. A recent line of research in schizophrenia is based on the distinction introduced by Beck et al10 between clinical insight (i.e., awareness of illness) and cognitive insight, which describes a metacognitive ability, specifically patients' flexibility towards their beliefs, judgements and experiences. The self-report Beck Cognitive Insight Scale (BCIS) examines two subcomponents: self-certainty, assessing overconfidence about being right (e.g. \"I know better than anyone else what mycomponents: self-certainty, assessing overconfidence about being right (e.g. \"I know better than anyone else what my problems are\"), and self-reflectiveness, assessing willingness to accept external feedback and recognition of dysfunctionalreasoning style (e.g. \"Some of the ideas I was certain were true turned out to be false\"). Cognitive insight in thisform describes two related but distinct aspects of metacognition in patients with psychosis, differentially associated withclinical insight, symptoms, treatment outcomes, and functioning.11 Another method for assessment of similar metacognitiveskills also used in schizophrenia is a scale (Metacognition Assessment Scale - Abbreviated, MAS-A) that is administeredthrough a specific interview and examines the capacities of self-reflectivity, understanding of the other individuals'mental states, and using metacognitive knowledge to respond to psychosocial challenges. Lysaker and colleaguesfound recently that metacognitive deficits assessed with MAS-A predict impaired insight in schizophrenia independentof symptoms.12 It is questionable whether BCIS and other methods used so far to assess self-reflection in psychoses arevalid and useful for patients with non-psychotic disorders.11 However, the metacognitive conceptualization of insightmight contribute to a new research framework for insight impairments across mental disorders. According to this approach, poor insight is in part a failure of self-reflection, i.e. the process by which we synthesizeand comprehend ideas about ourselves. This may be due to general deficits in metacognitive abilities (self-reflectivity,mentalizing) or may represent limited, domain-specific, or transient dysfunctions in metacognitive processes. Insight hasto be thought of as a relational concept, that is insight into something: insight into illness, current syndrome, specificsymptoms, pathological personality traits, social difficulties etc.1,3 In an integrated model of insight across mental disorders,aspects of metacognition interacting with multiple other (clinical, neurocognitive, emotional, and social) factorsdetermine patient's ability to correctly process information into self-awareness. The identification of these factors andtheir interactions may be a fruitful field in the research of insight.",

Parkinson's is a reformist ailment that causes degeneration of the frontal cortex, provoking both motor and mental issues. While Dysphonia is a voice issue that causes mandatory fits in the larynx muscle, this is one of its indications. While, Bradykinesia, which is ordinarily described as slowness of improvements, is one of the cardinal signs of Parkinson's sickness (PD). Essential clinical rating scales are used usually to measure bradykinesia in routine clinical practice albeit this kind of examination is uneven. It requires clinical investigation, and it can happen starting from the age of 6. Along these lines, this is a starter study that endeavors to recognize connections between Parkinson's contamination factors for basic unmistakable verification of the sickness. There are 1 million cases in India. It is hence reasonable to acknowledge that there is a connection between a patient's ability to talk/make and the development towards Parkinson's as these limits rot as time propels. The mark of the examination was to survey the features of the sound data and the hour of contorting drawing as an extent of bradykinesia. Henceforth to make strong proof that vocalization data and the handwriting test from a patient can assist with dissecting whether they experience the evil impacts of Parkinson's.

      "title": "Alpha-synuclein preformed fibrils: a tool to understand Parkinson’s disease and develop disease modifying therapy",
      "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by multiple motor and non-motor symptoms, which include, among others, constipation, sleep disturbance, bradykinesia, gait and balance abnormalities, muscle stiffness and resting tremor. The motor symptoms are caused by progressive age-related death of dopaminergic neurons and in the vast majority of patients suffering from age-related idiopathic PD the cause of dopaminergic neurodegeneration is unknown. Even in the familial early-onset PD where genetic mutations have been identified, the molecular mechanisms driving degeneration of dopaminergic neurons are far from clear. Consequently, there is no clinically approved disease-modifying therapy capable of stopping or at least slowing down the disease progression. Intracellular accumulation of insoluble protein deposits emerged as a common element of major age-related neurodegenerative disorders. Such deposits are commonly observed in histopathological examination of brains from patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) (α-synuclein (αSyn), β-amyloid peptide and Tau deposits); amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (SOD1, TDP43 and FUS deposits); multiple systems atrophy (MSA), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and PD (αSyn deposits in all three). Moreover, protein aggregation pathology is not limited to neurodegenerative diseases, but can also occur in peripheral organs, such as the gastrointestinal tract and kidneys, for example, in various amyloidoses. Despite being common denominator of most prevalent neurodegenerative disorders, the role of pathological protein aggregation in the etiology of AD, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, MSA, DLB, and PD remains unclear, with very few molecular mechanisms confirmed in patients. Moreover, several clinical trials have targeted protein aggregates in neurodegenerative disorders (e.g. treatments targeting β-amyloid peptide in AD) with limited success, leading to a view that protein aggregation might be just epiphenomenon accompanying neurodegeneration. However, in our opinion it is rather the lack of mechanistic understanding of pathological protein misfolding, spread and disturbances it causes to cells that hindered successful development of disease-modifying therapies (Chmielarz and Saarma, 2020). Recently developed models utilizing αSyn pre-formed fibrils (αSyn PFFs) have rapidly progressed our understanding of protein aggregation in PD, aiming for the development of more evidence based and ultimately effective treatments. αSyn is one of the main components of proteinaceous neuronal inclusions called Lewy Bodies characteristic for DLB and PD (Fouka et al., 2020). Lewy Bodies contain αSyn crowded together with fragments of membranous organelles and vesicles (Shahmoradian et al., 2019) and their formation has been recently proposed to drive neuronal pathology (Mahul-Mellier et al., 2020; Figure 1). Mutations and polymorphisms in the gene encoding αSyn are known risk factors and, in some cases, even direct causes of familial forms of PD. During PD progression, insoluble aggregates are increasingly observed in multiple brain regions, suggesting that misfolded αSyn spreading through interconnected neuronal networks possesses prion-like properties. Supporting thе hypothesis, host-to-graft spread of Lewy Body pathology was also observed in fetal midbrain-derived neurons transplanted to the brains of PD patients. Yet, despite that Lewy Bodies in PD have been described more than 100 years ago and for more than 20 years we know that αSyn is their main component, the causative role of αSyn in PD progression and degeneration of dopaminergic neurons has not been conclusively proven. For example, it is still not clear which conformation(s) and oligomeric state(s) (e.g. soluble oligomers or short fibrils) of misfolded αSyn are the most active in propagation and seeding aggregation in neurons and glial cells in the human brain. The molecular mechanisms for uptake of misfolded αSyn are also not fully elucidated. In addition to genetic and pathological evidence, application of sensitive protein misfolding cyclic amplification or real-time quaking-induced conversion assays demonstrated the presence of misfolded protein species capable of seeding αSyn aggregation in cerebrospinal fluid (Shahnawaz et al., 2020) and even in skin samples of PD patients (Manne et al., 2020). Inoculation with Lewy Body extracts collected post-mortem from PD patients’ brains induced the development and spread of αSyn pathology not only in rodents, but also in non-human primates (Arotcarena et al., 2020). Supported by such data, αSyn has emerged as a promising target for disease-modifying therapy in PD, MSA and, possibly, DLB. Proposed therapeutic approaches targeting αSyn include interfering with initial aggregation by small molecules stabilizing correctly folded protein conformation, directly binding misfolded fibrils and promoting either their dissociation or inhibiting their growth; enhancing degradation of intracellular αSyn by stimulating lysosomal activity or by small molecules – proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) – promoting preoteasomal degradation; lowering cellular αSyn levels by anti-sense oligonucleotides (ASO) and cell-penetrant nanobodies; inhibiting uptake and targeting transmission of extracellular αSyn with active and passive immunization. Many of such treatments are currently in clinical trials (see https://clinicaltrials.gov/ for a regularly updated list) and some have shown good safety profiles (e.g. anle138b, NPT200-11, ENT-01, nilotinib, memantine and several other small molecules and active and passive immunotherapies targeting αSyn misfolding and spread), however, conclusive evidence of their efficacy is still to be demonstrated. Interestingly, encouraging results have recently been reported from PASADENA phase II clinical trial of monoclonal humanized antibody designed to stop misfolded αSyn transmission. While not meeting its primary endpoint, this trial demonstrated clear improvement in both motor and cognitive symptoms, convincing enough to prompt Roche and Prothena to support moving into the next phase of clinical development (see https://ir.prothena.com/news-releases/news-release-details/roche-and-prothena-will-advance-prasinezumab-late-stage-clinical). Further development of successful αSyn targeting therapies would benefit immensely from a comprehensive understanding of the entire process of the pathology transmission, Lewy Body formation and resulting cellular damage. Significant progress in our understanding of these questions has been made in preclinical studies, thanks to multiple αSyn transgenic models (Airavaara et al., 2020) and the development of αSyn PFFs able to seed aggregation of endogenous αSyn in cultured cells and in vivo (Hijaz and Volpicelli-Daley, 2020).Figure 1: Preparation and application of α-synuclein preformed fibrils to reconstruct multiple steps of Lewy body formation and pathological protein transmission.(A) Major steps in PFF-induced αSyn aggregation model: (1) formation of αSyn fibrils in vitro; (2) cellular uptake of αSyn PFFs; (3) processing and release to cytoplasm; (4) recruitment of endogenous αSyn; (5) seeding of endogenous αSyn misfolding, formation of oligomers and insoluble αSyn fibrils; (6) maturation of fibrils and formation of Levy Bodies containing fragment of lipid membranes and mitochondria; (7) lysosomal and proteasomal degradation of misfolded αSyn oligomers and fibrils; (8) release and propagation of misfolded αSyn. (B) Application of αSyn PFFs and genetic models to study molecular mechanisms and develop therapies targeting pathological αSyn aggregation, and the remaining questions. Numbers correspond to major PFF-induced αSyn aggregation steps depicted in Figure 1. ASOs: Anti-sense oligonucleotides; HMW: high molecular weight; KO: knockout; LBs: Lewy bodies; NTFs: neurothrophic factors; OE: overexpression; PROTACs: proteolysis targeting chimeras.αSyn PFFs model allows studying multiple steps of Lewy Body pathology development: uptake of pathogenic fibrils, their internalization, transport, processing and recruitment of endogenous αSyn, its post-translational modifications (e.g. phosphorylation of Ser129), formation and maturation of Lewy Body-like inclusions (Figure 1A) and, finally, effects of these processes on cell function and survival. Furthermore, with αSyn PFFs we can study the mechanism of pathology transmission between neurons and in vivo spreading through neuronal connectome as well as motor and behavioral outcomes of accumulation of αSyn deposits in different brain structures (Hijaz and Volpicelli-Daley, 2020). Application of αSyn PFFs as well as genetic models allowed pre-clinical testing of multiple approaches aiming to develop disease-modifying PD therapy (Figure 1B). Additionally, the formation of fibrils may be templated with pathological αSyn species from the brain and/or cerebrospinal fluid samples of PD and MSA patients. In such case the fibrils assume pathological conformation of templating patient material, allowing studying the differences and discriminating pathological αSyn aggregates in PD and MSA (Shahnawaz et al., 2020). αSyn PFFs are purified prion-like, self-templating and transmittable aggregates of misfolded αSyn, which can induce formation of Lewy Body-like inclusions and cellular dysfunction both in in vitro and in vivo models (Er et al., 2020; Hijaz and Volpicelli-Daley, 2020). αSyn PFFs are formed by bacteria-expressed purified recombinant monomeric αSyn incubated at high concentration at 37°C with shaking for up to seven days, during which time it folds into elongated fibrils, exhibiting amyloid and self templating properties. Obtained fibrils are subsequently sonicated to form short, about 50 nm in length, fragments, most efficient at seeding pathology (Hijaz and Volpicelli-Daley, 2020; Figure 1A). Formation of fibrils in vitro can be easily monitored to investigate initial steps in this putatively nucleation-dependent process. For example, conversion of monomeric αSyn into pathogenic αSyn PFFs involves the preceding step of liquid-liquid phase separation, which can be fostered by PD linked mutations or heavy metal interaction (Ray et al., 2020). Understanding of the de novo αSyn PFFs formation and ability to monitor it is of obvious value for the development of drugs targeting this process. In vitro PFF model is also useful for testing compounds aiming to dissociate fibrils or inhibit their growth to avoid formation of putatively more toxic αSyn oligomers. Several such compounds (e.g. anle138b, NPT200-11, ENT-01, memantine and others) are currently in different phases of clinical trials. αSyn PFFs were also used to study neuronal uptake of misfolded αSyn, which was shown to be receptor-mediated, albeit alternative hypotheses have also been proposed, such as direct penetration of membrane, adsorptive-mediated endocytosis or transmission through tunneling nanotubes or exosomes (Fouka et al., 2020). After uptake, αSyn PFFs localize in lysosomal compartment and partial lysosomal processing might actually enhance or even be required for αSyn PFFs pathogenicity in cells (Hijaz and Volpicelli-Daley, 2020; Figure 1). However, it is still not clear how exactly αSyn PFFs are processed and how they are released to cytoplasm and, possibly, also to extracellular space. Several studies highlight the role of extracellular exosomes in promoting the spread of misfolded αSyn; moreover, elevated levels of αSyn in neuronal exosomes isolated from patients’ serum emerge as a promising diagnostic biomarker of early PD (Hijaz and Volpicelli-Daley, 2020; Jiang et al., 2020). However, additional studies are needed to resolve what type of autophagy/lysosomal pathway modulation will be beneficial and which might be ineffective or even harmful. We have recently utilized αSyn PFFs in vitro in primary dopaminergic neurons and in vivo in mouse to demonstrate protection against formation of αSyn deposits by stimulation of GDNF/RET signaling at early time points after αSyn PFF uptake, presumably through modulation of endo-lysosomal pathway (Chmielarz et al., 2020). Indeed, several molecules, such as ambroxol and venglustat, modulating lysosomal function by affecting levels and activity of lysosomal glucocerebrosidase are currently being tested in clinical trials for PD treatment. When applied to neuronal cultures, including primary and human induced pluripotent stem cell derived neurons, αSyn PFFs induce accumulation of insoluble intracellular deposits which maturate over time, increasing their resemblance to Lewy Bodies (Mahul-Mellier et al., 2020). Application of αSyn PFFs to neurons cultured in microfluidic chambers allows to dissect cell-to-cell transmission of pathological aggregates and to demonstrate the effectiveness of antibodies targeting extracellular αSyn or putative αSyn receptors in blocking this process. When αSyn PFFs are injected into the brain parenchyma, similar deposits are observed in anatomically connected areas (Arotcarena et al., 2020; Hijaz and Volpicelli-Daley, 2020), resembling the spreading behavior of pathology in PD patients (Horsager et al., 2020). Importantly, formation and spreading of αSyn PFFs induced deposits through neuronal connections is dependent on endogenous αSyn, and the extent of pathology varies between neuronal types (Hijaz and Volpicelli-Daley, 2020). Application of αSyn PFFs to primary mouse midbrain neuronal cultures or human stem cell-derived dopaminergic neurons allows monitoring accumulation of αSyn deposits and their effects on survival of PD-relevant dopaminergic neurons in vitro and in humanized rats (Er et al., 2020; Hoban et al., 2020). Sensitivity of αSyn PFF induced pathology to endogenous αSyn levels makes αSyn PFF based models ideally suited to test the effectiveness of ASOs, PROTACs or gene therapy aimed at lowering expression or promoting degradation of αSyn. The biggest limitation of αSyn PFFs model is that seeded deposits only modestly impair neuronal function and survival, the latter only after prolonged period of time (Mahul-Mellier et al., 2020), complicating testing of survival-promoting agents. Different research groups have reported variable effects of PFFs on cell survival. This could be partially because of technical difficulties in standardizing PFF preparations and batch-to-batch variations. However, delayed and modest effects on cell survival seem to be more in line with actual slow PD progression in humans. Actually, the mechanism by which pathological αSyn cause cell death remains elusive, although recent data suggest that this process is driven by formation of pathological deposits resembling Lewy Bodies containing not only αSyn but also fragments of membranous organelles (Mahul-Mellier et al., 2020). Understanding how αSyn pathology contributes to neuronal death could allow to design therapies aimed at increasing survival of cells already afflicted with αSyn pathology, such as neurotrophic factors or small molecules mimetics (Chmielarz et al., 2020). From the perspective of drug discovery, αSyn PFF models have advantages of being adaptable to multi-well plate formats with automatized quantification in dopaminergic neurons (Er et al., 2020). While still not feasible for use in high throughput screening campaigns, they can allow for functional validation of promising therapeutics in a physiologically relevant model allowing for monitoring αSyn aggregation and dopaminergic cell survival. Subsequently, therapies can be further validated in αSyn PFF based models in stem cell-derived human dopaminergic neurons and in vivo for long term effectiveness at slowing the spread of pathology and for behavioral outcomes (Hoban et al., 2020). Thanks to progressive nature of αSyn PFF in vivo model, it could also be used to identify a time window for effective treatment. Moreover, by varying the site of αSyn PFF injection (e.g. brain versus duodenum) (Arotcarena et al., 2020), we can verify the effectiveness of treatments in putative brain-first or body-first subtypes of PD (Horsager et al., 2020). Lastly, in vivo αSyn PFF models will be useful for development of PET tracers for longitudinal assessment of αSyn pathology in PD patients. When developed, such imaging tools would be extremely useful both for monitoring of clinical trials and early diagnosis of the disease. Overall, αSyn PFFs allow to study both pathophysiology of PD and the effectiveness of therapeutic approaches in physiologically relevant cellular and in vivo models, amenable to both meticulous investigations of mechanisms driving Lewy Body formation and spread, and screening and efficacy validation of compounds blocking these processes. While we still have many questions related to αSyn misfolding and pathology progression (Figure 1B), αSyn PFFs have been and will be very instrumental for helping researchers to find answers to these questions. Not surprisingly, αSyn PFFs elicit great hopes as a reliable and robust tool to model pathological protein aggregation in PD research and have seen extensive adoption in the field.

Es ist bis jetzt unklar, ob die somatosensorischen Symptome primar, dass heist durch eine direkte Storung der sensorischen peripheren oder zentralen afferenten Bahnen, oder sekundar, dass heist als Folge der motorischen Symptome oder der dopaminergen Therapie, auftreten. \r\nEs wurde das somatosensorische Profil von asymptomatischen PINK1- und PARKIN- Mutationstragern, die gefahrdet sind fruher oder spater an einem Morbus Parkinson zu erkranken mit Hilfe einer standardisierten quantitativ-sensorischen Testbatterie, dem so genannten QST-Protokoll (QST = quantitativ-sensorische Testung) des Forschungsverbundes Neuropathischer Schmerz, erstellt. Die Ergebnisse wurden mit einer passend zur Mutationsgruppe gesunden Kontrollgruppe verglichen. Zusatzlich wurde die Haufigkeit des Auftretens von pathologisch gemessenen QST-Werten dargestellt und eine elektrophysiologische Untersuchung der peripheren Nerven durchgefuhrt. \r\nDabei zeigte sich, dass die PARKIN-Mutationstrager eine Tendenz zu einer erhohten mechanischen Detektionsschwelle sowie einer heruntergesetzten Reizschwelle fur Kalteschmerz haben. Die PINK1-Mutationstrager wiesen eine erhohte mechanische Schmerzschwelle sowie eine erhohte Detektionsschwelle fur mechanische Reize auf. Eine Schadigung der peripheren Nerven konnte mit Hilfe der elektrophysiologischen Untersuchung ausgeschlossen werden. \r\nDiese Ergebnisse zeigten, dass somatosensorische Veranderungen bei den familiaren Parkinson-Syndromen vorkommen und den motorischen Symptomen vorangehen. Ein eindeutiges Muster zur Erkennung der Atiologie des Parkinsonsyndroms durch die Erstellung eines somatosensorischen Profils lies sich nicht feststellen. Weiterhin sprechen die Ergebnisse fur eine Storung in der zentralen Verarbeitung der verschiedenen Reize. Eine eindeutige Aussage daruber, ob es sich dabei um Storungen im dopaminergen System handelt, konnte nicht gemacht werden.",

Dystonia is often classified by etiology, and may be primary (sporadic or familial) or secondary. Secondary causes of dystonia have accompanying neurological deficits or an identifiable structural or metabolic lesion. Classification of dystonia based on etiology has undergone extensive modifications as new genetic bases for some forms of dystonia and other primary neurological diseases have been identified. (Chapters 3 and 8). Secondary dystonia can be further classified into symptomatic dystonia and the dystonia plus syndromes. Symptomatic dystonia is due to an identifiable brain disease, an obvious brain or peripheral insult, or a hereditary or sporadic degeneration of the brain. The dystonia plus syndromes (1) have accompanying neurological signs and/or clinical and laboratory findings suggestive of neurochemical disorders, without evidence of an underlying neurodegenerative process (Table 1).",

Definimos el Parkinson como un trastorno motor secundario a la degeneracion progresiva de dopamina en el cerebro cuya afeccion tiene una incidencia anual de 8-18 casos por cada 100.000 habitantes y afecta a personas mayores de 60 anos, sin distincion sexual. Este trastorno neurodegenerativo se caracteriza por manifestaciones tanto motoras como no motoras. Actualmente, no se dispone de ningun tratamiento medico ni quirurgico que retrase su progresion. Por ello, el principal objetivo es intentar disminuir los sintomas mediante tecnicas como la administracion de levodopa o la estimulacion cerebral profunda y conseguir la independencia funcional del paciente. En este documento desarrollamos los cuidados a ofrecer desde un enfoque multidisciplinar al paciente con Parkinson, entendiendo la importancia que tiene conocer cuales son los cuidados que precisan este tipo de pacientes para su avance y mejoria. EnglishParkinson’s disease, first described in 1817 by James Parkinson, is the second most frequent neurodegenerative disease. We define Parkinson’s disease as a motor dysfunction originated by the progressive degeneration of dopamine in the brain whose condition has an annual incidence rate of 8-18 cases for every thousand inhabitants. It affects people over 60, regardless of their sexual distinction. This neurodegenerative disorder is characterized by both motor and non-motor symptoms. Nowadays, there is no medical or surgical treatment to slow its progression. That is why the aim objective is to try to reduce the symptoms through the administration of L-dopa or the deep-brain stimulation to get the functional independence of the patient. In this study, we develop a planning care for a Parkinsonian patient, taking into account the importance of knowing which is the care required by these patients for their recuperation.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease that installs progressively and usually manifests itself in individuals around 60 years of age. Identifying the presence of olfactory dysfunction may enable early treatment and delay the onset of motor symptoms. Objective: To relate the diagnosis of olfaction dysfunction with the delay of the appearance of other symptoms of Parkinson’s Disease. Methodology: Review the BVL and SciELO databases using the descriptors “Parkinson” and “Smell” and applying the inclusion criteria: articles available on human studies in the period between 2012 and 2017. Results and Discussion: The main symptoms associated with PD are motor (tremors, stiffness, postural instability). However, PD is a multifactorial pathology, and there may even be olfactory dysfunction. This situation is worrying because it can reduce the patient’s quality of life. Through the smell it is possible to avoid the ingestion of toxic foods, besides the fact that the olfaction is always associated with the sense of taste, the palate. Olfactory dysfunction does not always occur in PD patients, but, when present, it is one of the initial symptoms, and may occur even a few years before motor manifestations. Therefore, it would be possible to initiate an early treatment to delay the appearance of other symptoms, considering that PD is still incurable. Conclusion: The use of olfaction tests is essential to identify risk groups for PD and is economically viable. Thus, the routine implementation of these tests is of great relevance as a way to delay the onset of motor symptoms of PD and to promote the improvement patients’s quality of life.",

      "abstract": "En la enfermedad de Parkinson (enfermedad neurodegenerativa mas comun tras la demencia tipo Alzheimer) la mayor tasa de incidencia se presenta en adultos alrededor de los 70 anos. Entre los trastornos no motores se encuentran alteraciones a nivel neuropsiquiatrico como la depresion. Raramente queda algun sistema del organismo fuera de la afectacion global que produce la enfermedad. En la septima decada de la vida, estos pacientes sufren dolencias tipicas de la edad como son la hipertension arterial, la diabetes mellitus, dislipemia, obesidad, ictus y cardiopatia isquemica que aumentan la fragilidad en estos pacientes.\nHipotesis principal: Los sintomas no motores (esencialmente depresion y factores de riesgo cardiovascular) serian riesgos mayores de fragilidad en pacientes con enfermedad de Parkinson en la septima decada de la vida.\nObjetivo principal: Analizar la influencia de sintomas no motores en el riesgo de fragilidad de pacientes con parkinson en la septima decada de la vida.\nObjetivos secundarios 1. Incidencia de depresion comorbilidad asociada a esta sintomatologia en la enfermedad de Parkinson (septima decada).\n2. Analisis de factores de riesgo cardiovascular mas prevalentes asociados a enfermedad de Parkinson.\n3. Evaluar la influencia de la edad y/o del sexo en el desarrollo de patologia no motora en la septima decada de la vida.\nFueron revisadas 225 historias clinicas de pacientes con parkinson. Se busco la presencia de depresion y factores de riesgo cardiovascular: hipertension arterial, dislipemia, obesidad, diabetes mellitus, cardiopatia isquemica e ictus. Mediante estudio estadistico, fueron analizadas cada una de las variables en relacion con el sexo del paciente, los anos de evolucion de enfermedad de Parkinson, la edad, el estadio del paciente en el momento del estudio, y la correlacion entre anos de evolucion de la variable en cuestion y los anos de evolucion de enfermedad de Parkinson. Posteriormente fueron analizadas las variables de dos en dos, estudiando en cada una de ellas de nuevo los mismos puntos que en las individuales mas el porcentaje de pacientes que presentaban las dos variables a estudio. En ultimo lugar se realizo un estudio de regresion logistica que indicaria la relacion de cada variable estudiada con el resto de variables.\n Los resultados derivados del estudio mostraron: 1. La hipertension arterial, la depresion y la dislipemia son los sintomas mas prevalentes en pacientes con enfermedad de Parkinson a los 70 anos en Murcia.\n2. Estos tres sintomas podrian contribuir a aumentar el riesgo de fragilidad en pacientes con enfermedad de Parkinson por lo que hay que poner especial atencion en su prevencion en parkinson.\n3. La depresion es un sintoma de origen endogeno y propio de la enfermedad de Parkinson que debe ser tratado y ser incluido especificamente en factores de riesgo cardiovascular.\n4. Ser mujer con enfermedad de Parkinson en la septima decada de la vida lleva asociado un riesgo de fragilidad mas elevado que el hombre condicionado por la mayor incidencia de depresion, hipertension arterial y dislipemia en el sexo femenino.\n5. La incidencia de obesidad y diabetes mellitus no es superior a la poblacion general, pero en pacientes con enfermedad de Parkinson estan interrelacionadas.\n6. En los pacientes de enfermedad de Parkinson no existe mayor incidencia ni de cardiopatia isquemica ni de ictus en el rango de edad de 70-80 anos.\n7. Sin embargo, el ictus hay que prevenirlo en aquellos pacientes de enfermedad de Parkinson que presentan depresion e hipertension arterial ya que tiene mayor riesgo de sufrirlo.\n8. Queda por determinar como todos estos factores pueden aumentar la fragilidad en pacientes de Parkinson de edad avanzada. In Parkinson's disease (the most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's dementia), the highest incidence rate occurs in adults around 70 years of age. Non-motor disorders include neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression. Rarely is there any system of the organism outside the global affectation that produces the disease. In the seventh decade of life, these patients suffer from typical ailments of age such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, dyslipemia, obesity, stroke and ischemic heart disease that increase the fragility in these patients.\nMain hypothesis: Non-motor symptoms (essentially depression and cardiovascular risk factors) would be greater risks of frailty in patients with Parkinson's disease in the seventh decade of life.\nMain objective: To analyze the influence of non-motor symptoms on the risk of fragility of patients with Parkinson in the seventh decade of life.\nSecondary objectives 1. Incidence of depression comorbidity associated with this symptomatology in Parkinson's disease (seventh decade).\n2. Analysis of the most prevalent cardiovascular risk factors associated with Parkinson's disease.\n3. To evaluate the influence of age and / or sex on the development of non-motor pathology in the seventh decade of life.\nTwo hundred twenty five clinical records of patients with Parkinson's disease were reviewed. Depression and cardiovascular risk factors were sought: arterial hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity, diabetes mellitus, ischemic heart disease and stroke. Statistical analysis was performed to analyze each of the variables in relation to the patient's sex, the years of evolution of Parkinson's disease, the age, the stage of the patient at the time of the study, and the correlation between years of evolution of the disease Variable in question and the years of evolution of Parkinson's disease. Subsequently, the variables of two in two were analyzed, again studying the same points in each one of them as in the individual ones, plus the percentage of patients who presented the two variables under study. Finally, a logistic regression study was carried out, which would indicate the relationship of each variable studied with the other variables.\nThe results derived from the study showed: 1. High blood pressure, depression and dyslipidemia are the most prevalent symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease at age 70 in Murcia.\n2. These three symptoms may contribute to increase the risk of fragility in patients with Parkinson's disease, so special attention should be paid to its prevention in Parkinson's disease.\n3. Depression is a symptom of endogenous origin and characteristic of Parkinson's disease that should be treated and included specifically in cardiovascular risk factors.\n4. Being a woman with Parkinson's disease in the seventh decade of life is associated with a higher risk of frailty than men, conditioned by the higher incidence of depression, hypertension and dyslipidemia in females.\n5. The incidence of obesity and diabetes mellitus is not higher than the general population, but in patients with Parkinson's disease are interrelated.\n6. In patients with Parkinson's disease, there is no higher incidence of ischemic heart disease or stroke in the age range of 70-80 years.\n7. Stroke, however, has to be prevented in patients with Parkinson's disease who have depression and high blood pressure since they are at increased risk for stroke.\n8. It remains to be determined how all these factors can increase frailty in elderly Parkinson's patients.",

      "abstract": "Sporadic Parkinson disease (PD) is, after Alzheimer disease (AD), the second most frequent neurodegenerative disorder.1 The pathologic process in PD is progressive and takes years to reach its full extent. It does not affect nonhuman vertebrates or organ systems other than the nervous system, and, apparently, it does not go into remission. Unlike AD, however, the pathology is distributed throughout the entire nervous system—that is, not only the central but also the peripheral and the enteric nervous systems (CNS, PNS, ENS). As a result, PD has come to be acknowledged as more than a monosystemic disorder with preferential obliteration of nigral dopaminergic neurons.2–8,e1-e3\n\nIn the clinically recognizable, i.e., motor, phase of sporadic PD, most patients display signs of motor dysfunction (hypo- or bradykinesia, cogwheel rigidity, postural instability, resting tremor),9,e4,e5 but these symptoms also occur in other disorders associated with dopamine loss in the nigrostriatal system.e6,e7 Familial forms of parkinsonism exist,3,e8,e9 and the syndrome may also develop as a sequel to intoxication, trauma, vascular alterations, metabolic disease, or infection.e3,e10-e14 In addition, parkinsonism can develop in tauopathies, including corticobasal degeneration and progressive supranuclear palsy,e15-e17 or in synucleinopathies, such as multiple system atrophy and Lewy body disease.10,11,e18-e20 Lewy body disease has been subdivided further into pure autonomic failure, dementia with Lewy bodies, and sporadic PD.11,12 The latter two entities are nearly indistinguishable at neuropathologic examination, and there is a growing consensus that, clinically, they are closely related, if not identical.13–17 Here, we refer only to the Lewy body pathology associated with the synucleinopathy sporadic (or idiopathic) PD, the most widespread form of parkinsonism.1,8,e25\n\nIn PD, typical α-synuclein immunoreactive inclusions (Lewy neurites [LNs], Lewy bodies [LBs]) develop within specific types of projection neurons in all portions of the …",

      "title": "Mild Parkinsonian signs: An overview of an emerging concept",
      "abstract": "Abstract Mild Parkinsonian signs (MPS) include gait and balance changes, rigidity, bradykinesia, and tremor. MPS can occur commonly during the clinical examination of older people who do not have known neurological disease, with prevalence estimates for MPS as a whole ranging from 15% to 95%. MPS are generally progressive and they are coupled with functional difficulties, impaired gait and balance, and increased risks of mild cognitive impairment, dementia, and mortality. The mechanistic basis for these signs is unclear, but is likely to be multifactorial, with possible factors including an age‐associated decline in dopaminergic nigrostriatal activity, the early development of neurodegenerative (Lewy body or Alzheimer's type) pathologies in the basal ganglia, or the accumulation of vascular pathology in the brain. It would be valuable to identify those individuals with MPS who are at increased risk for the development of future Alzheimer's disease, full‐blown Parkinson's disease, or strokes, and to develop therapeutic strategies to intervene to lessen the likelihood of MPS‐related morbidity and mortality. © 2007 Movement Disorder Society",

      "abstract": "The first step in treating a patient with Parkinson's disease (PD) and psychiatric symptoms is ensuring that the patient actually has PD. No disease-modifying treatments or neuroprotective drugs exist for PD. Treatments include levodopa; dopamine agonists such as pramipexole, ropinirole, and apomorphine; monoamine oxidase inhibitors such as seligiline and rasagaline; and glutamatergic antagonists such as amantadine. Psychiatric symptoms are highly prevalent in PD, but are often unrecognized and undertreated, and are easily missed if not specifically investigated. Psychotherapy is evidence based treatment for many idiopathic psychiatric disorders, and does not cause side effects or worsen motor symptoms. The specific psychiatric disorders in Parkinson's disease are: mood disorders, anxiety disorders, psychotic disorders and cognitive disorders. The other psychiatric symptoms in Parkinson's disease are: delirium, sleep disorders, and sexual disorders.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Diabetes is the most common cause of peripheral neuropathy in the world. Both type 1 (insulin‐dependent) and type 2 diabetes are commonly complicated by peripheral nerve disorders. Two main types of neuropathy are observed: the most common is a nerve fibre length dependent, distal symmetrical sensory polyneuropathy with little motor involvement but frequent, and potentially life threatening, autonomic dysfunction. Alteration of temperature and pain sensations in the feet is an early manifestation of diabetic polyneuropathy. The second pattern is a focal neuropathy which more commonly complicates or reveal type 2 diabetes. Poor diabetic control increases the risk of neuropathy with subsequent neuropathic pains and trophic changes in the feet, which can be prevented by patient's education. Key Concepts: Length‐dependent diabetic polyneuropathy is the most common neuropathy in the world. Neuropathic pains are the most common symptoms of diabetic neuropathy. Charcot joints and plantar ulcers are favored by loss of pain sensation. Autonomic dysfunction is commonly associated with small fibre diabetic neuropathy. The prevalence of diabetic polyneuropathy increases with duration and poor diabetic control. Focal neuropathies are more common in type 2 diabetic patient.",

Of note, two key changes in DSM-5 pertinent to older adults are elimination of minor depression from the appendix and elimination of the bereavement exclusion criterion for major depression. In a helpful addition, the DSM-5 major depression criteria now include a \"note\" on the relationship between depressive symptoms and response to significant loss. Depressive symptoms are likewise present in other DSM-5 disorders, such as adjustment disorder with depressed mood and mood disorder due to a general medical condition (see Table 5–1 ).

A manic episode is defined as an alteration in mood that is euphoric, expansive, or irritable; lasts for at least 1 week; and occurs with three other associated symptoms (e.g., decreased need for sleep, increased energy, racing thoughts, pressured speech, increased behaviors that may have high likelihood for bad outcome). Manic episodes in later life also may present with a mixture of manic, dysphoric, and cognitive symptoms, with euphoria being less common (Post 1978). When mania is associated with significant changes in cognitive function—so-called manic delirium—it may be difficult to distinguish from organic conditions or schizophrenia (Shulman 1986). A diagnosis of bipolar II disorder can be made when a patient has experienced one or more depressive episodes accompanied by at least one hypomanic episode. A hypomanic episode is defined as at least 4 days of altered mood (expansive, euphoric, irritable) occurring with at least three other associated symptoms (see above). Bipolar disorder not otherwise specified is defined as disorders with bipolar features that do not meet the criteria for specific bipolar disorders.",

      "title": "POSSIBLE PREDICTORS OF VASCULAR COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT–NO DEMENTIA",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: The term “predementia syndrome” identifies all conditions with age-related deficits in cognitive function reported in the literature, including a mild stage of cognitive impairment based on a normality model and pathological conditions considered predictive or early stages of dementia.1,2 Such predementia syndromes have been defined for Alzheimer's disease (AD), but have not yet been operationalized for vascular dementia (VaD) and other specific forms of dementia. Therefore, the term “predementia syndromes” includes different conditions, and of these predementia syndromes, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is the most widely used term to indicate older persons without dementia with no significant disability and mild memory or cognitive impairment that cannot be accounted for by any recognized medical or psychiatric condition.1,2 Predementia syndrome is, therefore, an umbrella term that includes also the preclinical phase of dementia of numerous rating scales developed for staging dementia (i.e., Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale score of 0.5 or “questionable dementia”).1 There is now ample evidence that MCI is often a pathology-based condition with a high rate of progression to AD.1,2 Therefore, MCI, and particularly amnestic MCI (aMCI) was also identified as the predementia syndrome for AD. The more recently proposed multiple subtypes of MCI were intended to reflect the heterogeneity of different types of dementia. Actually, the recent subclassification of MCI according to its cognitive features (dysexecutive MCI and aMCI or aMCI and non-amnestic MCI (naMCI): single domain aMCI and multiple domain aMCI or single domain naMCI, and multiple domain naMCI), clinical presentation (MCI with parkinsonism, or cerebrovascular disease (CVD), or depressive symptoms, or behavioral and psychological symptoms) or likely etiology (MCI-AD, vascular MCI, or MCI-Lewy body dementia) represents an attempt to control this heterogeneity.1,2 In particular, vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) is a heterogeneous group of cognitive disorders that share a presumed vascular cause.3 In 2003, it was hypothesized that people with VCI have a specific cognitive profile in which memory is preserved and executive function impaired.4 Within the VCI construct, the parallel condition to MCI is VCI–no dementia (VCI-ND) or vascular predementia MCI, defined as the clinical phenotype of cognitive impairment of a presumed vascular cause that is not severe enough to meet the criteria for dementia.3 NaMCI can, in some cases, be vascular in origin, and other subtypes of MCI can progress to VCI.3 The Canadian Study of Health and Aging (CSHA) found that, in elderly people with VCI-ND, low scores on tests of memory and semantic category fluency predicted incident cases of dementia (VaD and AD combined) 5 years later. Most of these incident cases had VaD.5 Other groups have also shown that reductions in memory, as part of a more global pattern of impairment, precede diagnoses of VaD and AD by up to 4 years.3,6 In the Italian Longitudinal Study on Aging (ILSA), in 2,963 individuals from a population-based sample, it was found that, in a predementia syndrome with a cognitive pattern similar to AD and with a central role for memory decline (aMCI), in those who progressed to dementia, 60% progressed to AD and 33% to VaD or VCI.6 Recently, in the CSHA, in people with no cognitive impairment at baseline, abstract reasoning was considerably worse in those who developed VCI than in those who developed AD and had memory impairment.7 These results suggest the existence of a preclinical phase of VCI (VCI-ND) during which widespread but subtle executive dysfunction plus memory impairment may be detected some years before a clinical diagnosis can be rendered. Beyond controlling the established vascular risk factors for stroke, prevention of VCI-ND might be possible through physical activity.8 In another recent community-based study, the Fremantle Diabetes Study (FDS), involving 205 older subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus (mean age 75.3), 164 subjects with normal cognition (CDR=0) and 41 with cognitive impairment without dementia or “questionable dementia” (CDR=0.5), after 1.6 years of follow-up, 33 (16.1%) had experienced cognitive decline. After controlling for age, education, and cognitive function, cognitive decline was predicted by urinary albumin excretion rates, whereas the use of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) appeared protective.9 The authors correctly acknowledged that blood pressure lowering has been shown to be effective in preventing stroke-related dementia (i.e., VCI), but the data on AD are conflicting,10 although the possible protective effect of ACEIs or ARBs may occur independently of blood pressure lowering. Given this evidence and the presence of type 2 diabetes mellitus in the whole FDS sample, it seems reasonable to postulate that the cognitive impairment without dementia identified with a CDR of 0.5 may be particularly due to vascular pathology (VCI-ND). In conclusion, we strongly suggest a vascular origin for the cognitive impairment without dementia predicted by microalbuminuria and ACEIs or ARBs in the FDS, with a clinical phenotype compatible with VCI-NA. These findings suggest new possible predictors of VCI-ND, beyond reported executive dysfunction plus memory impairment and physical activity.7,8 Conflict of Interest: The editor in chief has reviewed the conflict of interest checklist provided by the authors and has determined that the authors have no financial or any other kind of personal conflicts with this letter.

In addition, patients with PD also show cognitive and psychiatric dysfunction, including dementia, mild cognitive impairment, depression, hallucinations, among others. Interestingly, the occurrence of these symptoms –motor, cognitive, and psychiatric—vary among individuals, such that a subgroup of PD patients might show some of the symptoms, but another subgroup does not. This has prompted neurologists and scientists to subtype PD patients depending on the severity of symptoms they show. Neural studies have also mapped different motor, cognitive, and psychiatric symptoms in PD to different brain networks. In this review, we discuss the neural and behavioral substrates of most common subtypes of PD patients, that are related to the occurrence of (a) resting tremor (vs. nontremor-dominant), (b) mild cognitive impairment, (c) dementia, (d) impulse control disorders, (e) depression, and/or (f) hallucinations. We end by discussing the relationship among subtypes of PD subgroups, and the relationship among motor, cognitive, psychiatric factors in PD.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder clinically characterized by bradykinesia, rest tremor, rigidity, and postural and gait disturbances, which are frequently observed in older people. It also shows non-motor symptoms, such as depression, anxiety, cognitive impairment and dementia. The number of patients is gradually increasing worldwide. Aging is a risk factor for the onset of Parkinson's disease, and various physiological effects of aging influence its progression. Frailty is a geriatric syndrome in which the reversible and vulnerable status between robustness and disability is affected by various physiological stressors with aging. Frailty consists of physical, psychological and social aspects. Furthermore, sarcopenia, a syndrome characterized by the loss of muscle mass, strength and function, is also significantly associated with frailty. To maintain the quality of life of older people, frailty, including sarcopenia, should be quickly and appropriately managed. Polypharmacy is an important factor causing the progression of frailty in geriatric syndrome. Although Parkinson's disease and frailty have similar symptoms, and are considered to affect each other, the clinical features and mechanisms of both largely remain unclear. Nevertheless, little literature on the relationship between frailty and Parkinson's disease is currently available. This narrative review aims to clarify the relationships between Parkinson's disease and frailty, not only on the physical, but also on the mental, cognitive, and social aspects and issues regarding polypharmacy in Parkinson's disease explored by previous studies.

      "abstract": "Abstract Schizoaffective disorder was first described in the literature by Kasanin in 1933, referring to a group of patients in whom both psychotic (“schizo”) and mood (“affective”) symptoms are prominent features. A formal diagnosis of schizoaffective disorder requires that (1) a mood episode (major depressive, manic, or mixed) co‐occurs with active schizophrenia symptoms; (2) hallucinations or delusions have occurred for at least 2 weeks in the absence of prominent mood symptoms; (3) the mood symptoms are present for a substantial portion of the total active and residual phases of schizophrenia; and (4) the symptoms are not related to the direct physiological effects of a substance or a general medical condition. Schizoaffective disorder can be further broken down into two subtypes: depressive type (if the mood component consists of only major depressive episodes) and bipolar type (if a manic or mixed episode is part of the mood component). Because loss of interest or pleasure also resembles another common symptom of schizophrenia (i.e., anhedonia), the other essential feature of a major depressive episode, pervasive depressive mood, must be present in the depressive type of schizoaffective disorder.",

Parkinson’s often starts with a tremor in one hand. Slow movements, stiffness in the body, and loss of balance are some of the major symptoms of the disease. Damaged nerve cells present in the brain cause drops in the levels of dopamine in the body. It is very difficult to detect Early-Stage Parkinson’s Disease. Researchers have now been able to detect Parkinson’s disease at an early stage (Perhaps at Stage 2 or Stage 3), but there have been no significant advancements in the detection of Parkinson’s at the initial stage. Analyzing the handwriting styles can be one of the initial symptoms of the disease. The dataset given by NIATS of the Federal University of Uberlandia was used in our research.

However, there are a number of signs and symptoms that could raise the suspicion of this neurological condition. In such situations, the collaboration between the family doctor and neurologist becomes extremely important, because the family doctor can identify these changes more easily when interacting with the patient who may come accusing other symptoms, even other than those that may suggest Parkinson’s disease. In this case, an early diagnosis is possible and will allow the initiation of treatment which is important not only to maintain the patient’s quality of life for a longer period of time, but even to improve life expectancy. The role and importance of the family doctor are not limited to the early diagnosis, becaue monitoring the patient with chronic disease is interdisciplinary and the possible side effects of chronic treatment or the complications that may occur will often cause the patient to turn to his family doctor who may decide to start the treatment for non-motor disorders or may refer the patient for further investigations.",

Brief psychotic disorder is an acute but transient disorder with the onset of one or more of the following psychotic symptoms: Delusions Hallucinations Disorganized speech Grossly disorganized or catatonic behavior At least one of these symptoms must be delusions, hallucinations, or disorganized speech. The symptoms in BPD last between one day to one month, with a complete return to premorbid level of functioning after the disease course in response to antipsychotic medications. The disturbance in behavior cannot be better accounted for by schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, mood disorder with psychotic features, or be a direct result of a drug, medication, or medical condition like thyrotoxicosis, sarcoidosis, or syphilis.",

      "title": "Design and Development of Efficient Model to Predict Neurodegenerative Disorders Using Advanced LSTM: A Review of Literature",
      "abstract": "Purpose: A continuous Nervous system illness that influences development is known as neurodegenerative sickness. Side effects show up continuously, and may start with a scarcely distinguishable quake in just a single hand. Quakes are normal, but they are frequently joined by firmness or eased back versatility. The emphasis is on Parkinson's infection specifically (PD). The signs and results of Parkinson's contamination shift starting with one individual then onto the next. Early reprimand markers could be subtle and go unnoticed. Regardless, when aftereffects start to influence the different sides of your body, secondary effects normally jump on single side of your body and decay on that side. Parkinson's illness is brought about by the demise of nerve cells in the substantia nigra, a portion of the cerebrum. The exactness of a few fake brain network approaches, for example, Convolutional Neural Network, Recurrent Neural Network, Long-Short term Memory network have been concentrated on to analyze Parkinson's illnesses. This record inspects a synopsis of a portion of the examination and concentrates on that have been directed in the field of clinical diagnostics. In light of the audit, research holes are featured, as well as examination needs for future review. Approach: A thorough study on the algorithms used in analysis of handwritten and vocal to distinguish and anticipate Parkinson's illness. Findings: The review showed that the majority of the AI and deep learning strategy can order neurodegenerative illness in view of vocal, transcribed and walk investigation in light of the clinical datasets. The new crossover philosophy proposed will be more exact as the model will actually want to foresee and distinguish neurodegenerative sickness in view of eye development. Originality: The sort of information expected for forecast and discovery framework are considered and the design and portrayal outline of a proposed model are incorporated. Paper Type: Literature Review.",

      "title": "Neurotransmission in Parkinson’s disease: beyond dopamine",
      "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease (PD) is most frequently associated with characteristic motor symptoms that are known to arise with degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. However, patients with this disease also experience a multitude of non‐motor symptoms, such as sleep disturbances, fatigue, apathy, anxiety, depression, cognitive impairment, dementia, olfactory dysfunction, pain, sweating and constipation, some of which can be at least as debilitating as the movement disorders and have a major impact on patients’ quality of life. Many of these non‐motor symptoms may be evident prior to the onset of motor dysfunction. The neuropathology of PD has shown that complex, interconnected neuronal systems, regulated by a number of different neurotransmitters in addition to dopamine, are involved in the aetiology of motor and non‐motor symptoms. This review focuses on the non‐dopaminergic neurotransmission systems associated with PD with particular reference to the effect that their modulation and interaction with dopamine has on the non‐motor symptoms of the disease. PD treatments that focus on the dopaminergic system alone are unable to alleviate both motor and non‐motor symptoms, particularly those that develop at early stages of the disease. The development of agents that interact with several of the affected neurotransmission systems could prove invaluable for the treatment of this disease.",

      "abstract": "Sabemos que la enfermedad de Parkinson, es el trastorno neurodegenerativo más frecuente, después de la enfermedad de Alzheimer y que su principal factor de riesgo es la edad avanzada. Dicha enfermedad supone cada vez más un reto de salud pública en nuestras sociedades occidentales progresivamente envejecidas.(1) Esta se caracteriza clínicamente por la presencia de la tríada motora: acinesia o lentitud de movimientos, temblor de reposo y rigidez, por ello ha sido clásicamente considerada y estudiada como un trastorno motor; Sin embargo, en las últimas décadas, ha aumentado el reconocimiento de manifestaciones no motoras como la apatía, el deterioro cognitivo o los síntomas disautonómicos entre otros.(1) Según la Asociación Europea de la Enfermedad de Parkinson el 94 % de los pacientes sufre anomalías motoras, el 84 % síntomas depresivos y en un 65 % trastornos cognitivos, Estas diferencias fisiopatológicas están influenciadas por factores genéticos, emocionales y epigenéticos, que se expresan en una inflamación crónica de bajo grado ,asociado directamente a una mayor degeneración de las células neuronales ; ésta combinación supone para el paciente una progresiva disminución en su calidad de vida. Se presenta el caso de un paciente de 78 años de edad con diagnóstico de enfermedad de Parkinson desde hace 17 años, en manejo médico convencional por especialistas en neurología, con pobre respuesta al tratamiento , con deterioro clínico y con alteración importante de su calidad de vida, que al momento de su valoración inicial, aplicando la escala de calidad de vida Euroqol 5D mostraba un puntaje 6.74 % , y en el termómetro de calidad de vida de esta misma escala 20 puntos % , con una severidad según la escala Hoehn y Yahr tambien de calidad de vida , en estadio 5, indicando (necesita ayuda para todo permanece sentado o acostado) , y por el índice de Katz que evalúa la independencia de un enfermo para realizar actividades de la vida diaria por calculadora virtual registrando los items obtenidos . 5 puntos ( incapacidad severa) , se inicio tratamiento desde la medicina biorreguladora de sistemas, aplicando como conceptos la detoxificación básica y central , la inmunomodulación y la regulación del eje hipotálamo hipófisis adrenal (HHA) con medicamentos como Galium Heel, Cerecomp Compositum, Traumeel S , Neurexan entre otros. por vía oral y endovenosa; después de 3 meses de tratamiento se logra evidenciar en el paciente una mejoría notable de sus síntomas clínicos siendo muy evidente en el temblor , rigidez , agitación psicomotora , demostrado por cambios en los resultados de las escalas ;en la escala Euroqol 5D mejorando en un 62.43 % en su calidad de vida , 50 puntos % en el termometro de calidad de vida de esta misma escala y ; pasando a un estadio 3 en la escala de Hoehn y Yahr (alteración bilateral leve o moderada con cierta inestabilidad postural), y obteniendo en el índice de Katz un puntaje de 3 puntos ; además se logro reducir la dosis de medicación antihipertensiva .Con este caso clínico podemos sugerir que el uso de medicamentos biorreguladores en dosis bajas multiobjetivo y multicomponente favorecen el proceso de autorregulación de redes desreguladas en la Enfermedad de Parkinson como son el sistema linfático \" glinfático\", la red neuroendocrina ,mitocondrial y modulando la inflamación crónica de bajo grado; logrando disminuir la severidad de los síntomas , la limitación funcional y mejorando la calidad de vida .",

      "abstract": "By some estimates, nearly half of patients with PD also suffer depression. Because features of PD frequently overlap with typical manifestations of major affective disorder (or mild dysthymia), both diagnosis and treatment of this comorbidity are challenging. Some of these interactive features include cognitive and speech deficits and impairments in emotional expression (e.g., PD-related facial masking) or processing. Parkinsonian depression probably is caused by an independent abnormality rather than as a maladaptive response to disease, in that the degree of depression is not correlated with PD severity. Prognostically, depressive features (e.g., introversion, inflexibility) may represent a subtle premorbid state heralding the onset of PD or an accelerated cognitive decline thereafter. Therapeutic mainstays for parkinsonian depression include psychosocial counseling at the time of PD diagnosis (and during advanced stages of PD) as well as appropriate medication regimens, the relative clinical efficacy of which remain a matter of ongoing clinical inquiry: levodopa, dopamine agonists, selegilene, tricyclic antidepressants, and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors). This review formulates a rational treatment algorithm to assist in clinical management of parkinsonian depression, an enormously complex clinical entity.",

      "title": "Diagnosis and Biomarkers of Parkinson's Disease",
      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD), also known as Parkinsonism, is a neurological condition that mostly, but not solely, impairs movement control. It is distinguished by an increased deterioration and loss of dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra area of the brain. The exact aetiology of PD is complicated and multifaceted. It is considered to comprise a blend of genetic vulnerability and environmental variables that contribute to the development of the condition. Some of the important reasons include heredity, the pile-up of abnormal alpha-synuclein proteins in the brain and enteric nervous systems, heavy metal neurotoxicity, head trauma, and so on. Over the years, the diagnosis of PD has mostly hinged on the clinical triad of its movement-related symptoms: tremor, rigidity, and bradycardia. Though these symptoms are not prodromal of PD, they are often detected in the extremely severe phase of the illness when therapies and treatments are no longer highly effective. Therefore, this review focuses on the need for understanding the prodromal biomarkers associated with PD, such as non-motor biomarkers, biochemical biomarkers, and inflammatory biomarkers, as well as advances in neuroimaging biomarkers, in order to facilitate new diagnostic methods other than the normal motor symptoms to aid early diagnosis and responsive therapies and treatments of the disease. Some new discoveries, such as that of distinct neural networks and pathways of the illness, combination biomarkers, and salivary gland biopsy, are promising and could assist to quickly detect the condition.",

The classical motor symptoms of PD include bradykinesia, rest tremor, muscular rigidity and postural impairment. Apart from the typical motor symptoms, PD is characterized by a wide range of different non-motoric symptoms like depression, dementia, speech disorders, sleep disorders and autonomic dysfunction. Clinical diagnosis of PD is based on the presence of parkinsonian motor features and dopaminergic imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) or single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) are used to confirm the diagnosis and to distinguish PD from other similar diseases. Available medications for PD only treat symptoms of the disease trying to control motor features and to improve the quality of life of patients.\r\nParkinson’s rating scales have an important role in clinical practice. They are used to assess the degree of disease-related disability, for monitoring and predicting further progression of the disease and to help to evaluate the efficiency of the therapeutic procedures. Generally, they can be divided into those related to motor manifestations and to those evaluating non-motoric symptoms. However, the best results and an accurate insight into the patient's health condition can only be obtained by their combination. The most well established and widely used rating scale is the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale – UPDRS, which combines elements of both motor and nonmotor scales. Many clinical trials have proven that the UPDRS demonstrates high internal consistency and reliability, shows moderate to good validity and has a stable factor structure. The second two most used rating scales are the Hoehn-Yahr Scale (HY) and Schwab and England Scale (SE-ADL), which demonstrate similar validity and reliability as the UPDRS.",

In each case, the pain syndrome overshadowed the other features of the parkinsonism. Five patients experienced oral pain and three patients, all women, had genital pain. No other definable organic cause was detected to explain the symptoms in any case. The genital pain tended to fluctuate in severity with the motor manifestations of the parkinsonism and could be abolished or reduced by levodopa.

It is likely that chronic peripheral neuropathy may lead to neuroplastic changes and affect the central nervous system. These functional and anatomical changes can exacerbate the overall experience of pain. As the changes become more chronic, co-morbid conditions such as sleep disorders, anxiety and depression can accompany the chronic pain, and further complicate treatment. The prevalence of NP conditions is difficult to establish. There are many confounding factors that may lead to under-reporting of NP. In primary medical care settings, the prevalence has been reported to be between 2 and 11%.[34] Studies have focused on specific NP conditions, secondary to other pathological conditions. It has been shown that the about 26% of patients with type 2 diabetes can experience neuropathy. Cancer patients indicate a prevalence of 19–39. About 1% and 37% of chronic low back pain patients may have a neuropathic component related to it.[567] Even with high prevalence in chronic conditions, the overall numbers of NP conditions tends to be small. One of the reasons is the lack of identification, diagnosis, and treatment. There is no standard approach between health care providers for NP. NP can be localized to the craniofacial region such as in trigeminal and glossopharyngeal neuralgia, painful traumatic trigeminal neuropathy (PTTN), burning mouth syndrome, or may affect other areas of the body such as in case of diabetic neuropathy. In the orofacial region, NP mainly affects the trigeminal nerve and can be referred to as Neuropathic Orofacial Pain (NOP). Peripheral NP can be a result of nerve damage. Different types of nerve damage such as crush, transection, partial transection, and inflammatory insult can induce various clinical pain presentations and further complicate the process of diagnosis and management. In the orofacial region, development of pain following nerve damage (i.e., PTTN) is around 3–5%, which is low when compared to other parts of the body, where an incidence of painful traumatic neuropathy is 5–17%.[891011] PTTN secondary to dental procedures can be a major complication. Third molar extractions have been reported to cause altered sensations in 0.3–1% of cases.[121314] Persistent pain after successful endodontics has been found to occur in 3–13% of the patients.[151617] The incidence of neurosensory disturbance post implant can range anywhere from 0.6 to 36%.[18192021] Causes of central pain may include trauma, cerebrovascular injuries, tumors, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease. NP can also be classified based on frequency into continuous or episodic. Episodic neuropathies are usually characterized by short, sudden, sharp, or electrical like paroxysmal pain. The pain is usually severe and sporadic in nature. Continuous NP is usually characterized by continuous dull pain of mild to moderate intensity with occasional paroxysms of pain. There is presently no definitive cure to this condition, and the available treatment requires long-term prescription medications with significant side effects. In some cases, surgical procedures and adjunctive therapy are also recommended. Evaluation of sensory alterations can be performed using quantitative sensory testing which is a noninvasive assessment of normal and abnormal responses of the nervous system to various stimuli. Mapping and sketches of the affected area can help treatment decisions and management. The medications used for NP can include antidepressants, anticonvulsants, antiarrhythmics, opioids and nonopioid analgesics, and topical medications.[22] Adjunctive treatment can include but is not limited to a variety of options which include physical therapy, acupuncture, hypnosis, counseling, biofeedback, massage, relaxation, pressure, herbs, yoga, exercise, and electrotherapy. The prevailing “trial and error” approach to NP treatment includes a titration regimen of 3–8 weeks which is very often repeated several times before an effective medication for the individual patient is identified. As health care providers it is important to recognize NOP conditions to avoid unnecessary treatment and suffering. Financial support and sponsorship Nil.

      "title": "Basal Ganglia Disease And Depression",
      "abstract": "Abstract Diseases of the basal ganglia are quintessential neuropsychiatric disorders, characterized by abnormal movements, cognitive impairment, and psychiatric symptoms and signs. Depression is common in these illnesses and may occur at presentation or during the course of the illness. Individuals may present to the psychiatrist before seeing a neurologist. Depression is an important target for research, as it affords a unique perspective on the pathophysiology of basal ganglia diseases as well as an alternative method of understanding the biology of mood disorders. Traditionally, basal ganglia diseases are diagnosed and treated by neurologists, who define their onset by specific motor manifestations. Psychiatric symptomatology has been considered peripheral to the understanding of the motor disorders that define basal ganglia diseases. There is growing evidence for the contrary view that mood and affect are integrally related to the evolution of these diseases. For example, in diseases such as Huntington’s disease or Wilson’s disease, where the genetic mutation has been identified, it is possible to identify presymptomatic individuals, prior to the development of motor signs, who are unaware of their genetic status, and determine whether cognitive or psychiatric manifestations occur more often in gene-positive than in genenegative individuals. Another way to examine the role of psychiatric impairment is to study individuals in the general population who have undergone psychiatric assessments and to determine if individuals with a history of affective disorder are more likely to develop specific basal ganglia diseases (e.g., Parkinson’s disease) than individuals without mood disorders. This chapter includes a review of the epidemiology, prevalence, and correlates of depression in basal ganglia diseases and their treatment.",

      "title": "Aripiprazole-Induced Parkinsonism in a Child",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: Parkinsonism is a neurologic syndrome that manifests as any combination of 6 cardinal features: tremor at rest, rigidity, bradykinesia/hypokinesia, flexed posture, loss of postural reflexes, and the freezing phenomenon.1 At least 2 of these features, with at least 1 being either tremor at rest or bradykinesia, must be present for a definitive diagnosis of parkinsonism.1 The biochemical abnormality in parkinsonism is reduced dopaminergic neurotransmission in the basal ganglia.1\r\n\r\nIn 1954, Steck2 first described neuroleptic-induced parkinsonism in patients taking chlorpromazine. This observation was confirmed by Gade and Heinrich3 in 1955. The prevalence of neuroleptic-induced parkinsonism is difficult to ascertain because of heterogenous patient populations, variable drug regimens, and other factors that make this distinction extremely difficult. In most cases, however, it is second only to Parkinson's disease as the most common cause of parkinsonism.4,5,6 Various medications such as neuroleptics, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, lithium, valproic acid, calcium channel blockers, antiarrhythmics, procholinergics, chemotherapeutics, amphotericin B, estrogen, and others have been implicated.4 To our knowledge, we are reporting the first published case of aripiprazole-induced parkinsonism.\r\n\r\nCase report. A 12-year-old white boy presented to the emergency department in 2010 with chief complaints of excessive drooling, generalized slowing of body movements, and difficulty in walking with stiffness in arms and legs for 3 days. His psychiatric history was significant for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD; nightmares, flashbacks, numbing, avoidance, and sexually acting-out behavior) due to physical and sexual abuse, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; hyperactivity, impulsivity, and inattention), oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), and mood disorder not otherwise specified (longstanding history of mood dysregulation, mood swings, and excessive irritability). On mental status examination, he described his mood as “sad.” His affect was blunted, his speech was limited to short response, and he denied having audiovisual hallucinations. He was not delirious. On physical examination, he was found to have bradykinesia, lip smacking, flexed posture, and cogwheel rigidity. There was no past history of illicit substance or alcohol abuse. There was no family history of movement disorders.\r\n\r\nHis outpatient medications included lisdexamfetamine 70 mg orally every morning and guanfacine 1 mg orally every morning. Within 3 days of initiation of benztropine 1 mg orally twice daily and aripiprazole 5 mg/d orally, he developed classic parkinsonian symptoms, ie, bradykinesia, cogwheel rigidity, and flexed posture. After emergency department stabilization, he was admitted to the inpatient psychiatry unit with an additional diagnosis of neuroleptic-induced parkinsonism. Findings from his routine blood work including complete blood cell count with differential, comprehensive metabolic profile, and drug screen as well as noncontrast head computed tomography scan were within normal limits. All medications were stopped except benztropine 1 mg orally twice daily, and amantadine 100 mg orally twice daily was given, which led to symptom resolution within 72 hours. After release from the hospital, he was rechallenged with an antipsychotic, quetiapine extended release (XR) 50 mg orally every evening, with reemergence of parkinsonian symptoms. Quetiapine XR was discontinued, with dramatic resolution of parkinsonian symptoms.\r\n\r\nA PubMed search for the years 1954 to 2010 with the keywords antipsychotics, aripiprazole, parkinsonism, and children was performed, and a Google Scholar search incorporating the same keywords and range of years was also conducted. To our knowledge, only 2 casereports of drug-induced parkinsonism in children7,8 have been published.\r\n\r\nNeuroleptic-induced parkinsonism results from a diminution in dopamine activity.9 This can be induced by depletion of dopamine in presynaptic stores (eg, during reserpine treatment), dopamine-blocking agents (eg, antipsychotics), and the atypical calcium-blocking agent cinnarizine.9 Dopamine-2 blockade in nigrostriatal dopamine system results in parkinsonian symptoms in patients who are taking antipsychotics.10 This effect is frequent with typical antipsychotics, being strong D2 blockers, compared to atypical antipsychotics, which are relatively weak D2 blockers.11 Absence of tremor and reversibility are typical of drug-induced parkinsonism rather than Parkinson's disease.12\r\n\r\nThis syndrome usually subsides with dose reduction or medication cessation.9 As such reduction or cessation is not always possible, alternative strategies include switching from a high-potency D2 blocking agent (eg, fluphenazine) to a lower-potency first-generation antipsychotic or second-generation antipsychotic agent (eg, quetiapine). According to the literature, aripiprazole, a partial D2 agonist, may also decrease the risk of acute extrapyramidal symptoms.9 Adjunctive anticholinergic agents, eg, benztropine or dopamine agonists such as amantadine, are effective agents to alleviate extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS).9\r\n\r\nPhysicians should look for the symptoms of parkinsonism and movement disorders in children who are on treatment with antipsychotics, either typical or atypical. Incidence of EPS appears to be greater for typical antipsychotics. Among atypical antipsychotics, hierarchy of EPS risk is risperidone > olanzapine = ziprasidone = aripiprazole > quetiapine > clozapine.10,13 If challenged by a neuroleptic again, patients may have reemergence of parkinsonian symptoms.",

Since therapy and prognosis differ considerably between different forms of parkinsonism, an early correct diagnosis is of great clinical significance but may be challenging on clinical grounds alone. Ancillary tests for enhancement of diagnostic accuracy include drug-challenge testing to assess dopaminergic responsiveness, neuroimaging to evaluate nigrostriatal pre-synaptic dopaminergic function or evidence for structural abnormalities, and genetic testing to identify common genetic subtypes of Parkinson’s disease. Therapeutic management of parkinsonism mainly depends on the underlying pathology. Levodopa is the single most effective way to treat the motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease, but it may also be at least partially effective in other types of parkinsonism, so that a trial with levodopa will be part of the treatment approach in most patients presenting with parkinsonism.",

Patients and Methods: The study used a patients and methods approach. The study also comprised studies and papers that provided information on clinical aspects, as well as links and correlations between Parkinson’s disease and mental illnesses. Results: Symptoms of mental disorders are extremely prevalent in PD, but they are frequently undetected, undertreated, and overlooked if not evaluated precisely. Neuropsychiatric disorders of Parkinson’s disease divide into a number of major groups: anxiety and mood disorders, psychosis, behavioral modifications such as sexual disorders, impulse control disorders, dopaminergic medication abuse, and sleeping disorders. Conclusion: The majority of mental health conditions in PD are treatable, and failure to do so has a negative impact. Numerous investigations demonstrate that psychiatric symptoms influence the quality of life more than motor manifestations. Depression seems to be associated with deterioration in cognitive performance, tasks associated with everyday living, and motor performance and might have the greatest influence on the quality of life in PD. Psychosis is the leading cause of caretaker concern and a significant predictor of nursing residence relocation. The objective of therapy for mental illnesses in PD ought to include remission; inadequate treatment must be avoided.",

      "abstract": "In Parkinson's disease, a postural/kinetic tremor may occur in association with the classical resting tremor. According to the consensus statement of the Movement Disorder Society on tremor,1 this association is classified as type I (classical parkinsonian tremor) if the difference between the frequencies of postural/kinetic tremor and resting tremor is less than 1.5 Hz; and as type II if this difference is more than 1.5 Hz. In type I tremor, resting tremor and postural tremor share common pharmacological properties, responding to levodopa.2,3 Type II tremor (that is, a predominant postural/kinetic tremor associated with a resting tremor of a lower frequency) is considered to be a combination of essential tremor and parkinsonian tremor, and is reported in between 3% and 24% of the patients diagnosed as having Parkinson’s disease.3 Though postural/kinetic tremor and resting tremor may show some overlap in their electrophysiological properties in Parkinson’s disease, the postural/kinetic component does not respond to levodopa.3 Nevertheless, clinical criteria may be insufficient to differentiate between Parkinson’s disease and essential tremor.\n\nWe report a case of a 70 year old patient affected by essential tremor and Parkinson's disease, in whom acute dopaminergic challenge tests allowed us to differentiate between the two components of severe bilateral arm tremor.\n\nAcute dopaminergic challenge tests, which are well accepted as a diagnostic tool in Parkinson’s disease, may be helpful in …",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most popular variety of parkinsonism and is known as \"idiopathic parkinsonism\" because the cause is unknown. PD is a common neurology-related disorder after Alzheimer's. Reduction of dopaminergic cells and increased iron deposition in the SN of the midbrain are the primary pathophysiologic causes of tremors, bradykinesia and rigidity. Motor symptoms are seen due to loss of dopamine, whereas nonmotor symptoms are through cholinergic, serotoninergic or noradrenergic systems. This neurodegenerative disease is also called a subtype of synucleinopathy. A protein called alpha-synuclein is abnormally accumulated in the brain leading to the destruction of brain cells resulting in PD-specific symptoms. Clinically and pathologically many neurodegenerative diseases mimic each other and the most common being the close resemblance of PD being mimicked as Alzheimer's disease. In Alzheimer's disease, however, a different protein known as tau protein accumulates in brain cells. Thus, clinical presentations differ predominantly, and dementia is the presentation of Alzheimer's disease, whereas tremors and imbalance would be the presentation of PD [1].",

      "abstract": "Parkinson disease (PD) is the most frequent neurodegenerative disorder, affecting about 1% of people over 50 years old. It is caused by the progressive loss of dopaminergic (DA) neurons, accompanied by the accumulation of Lewy bodies, which are abnormal structures inside nerve cells that contain proteins such as a-synuclein, Parkin, and components of the ubiquitin proteasomal pathway (a cellular-degradation pathway). Patients are usually treated with levodopa, and although the drug initially improves motor symptoms, many patients later develop a range of abnormal or uncontrolled muscle movements, called dyskinesias. More than 90% of PD cases are sporadic, but rare genetic forms may yield invaluable information on the pathogenesis of both familial and spontaneous PD.\r\n\r\nAfter mutations affecting Parkin, mutations in PINK1 (PTEN-induced putative kinase 1) are the second-most common cause of autosomal recessive PD (where both parents must contribute a defective gene for PD to arise in the offspring). Point or truncation mutations in PINK1 produce PD with a broad phenotypic spectrum, from early-onset with atypical features to typical late-onset PD. Pathogenic PINK1 mutations—of which about 20 have been identified—annihilate or reduce the kinase activity of the protein. A study by Julia W. Pridgeon (Department of Pharmacology, Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, Georgia, United States) and colleages published in this issue of PLoS Biology shows that the failure of PINK1 to phosphorylate one particular substrate, TRAP1, can sensitize cells to the lethal effects of reactive oxygen species.",

      "title": "Pathway for Parkinson disease",
      "abstract": "Parkinson disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease with unknown etiology. PD is commonly referred to as a “motor disease,” reflecting its clinical symptoms, including resting tremors of extremities, muscular rigidity, shuffling gait, stoop posture, and bradykinesia (1). The underlying pathology of PD is progressive neuronal loss, particularly in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc), and the presence of abnormal protein-rich aggregates—known as Lewy bodies—in the remaining neurons (2). The loss of dopaminergic neurons in the SNc, leading to dopamine deficiency, is believed to be responsible for the motor and nonmotor symptoms, including orthostatic hypotension, mood disorders, sleep disorder, and loss of sense of smell. Dopamine replacement therapy provides symptomatic relief, but disease progression continues unabated. Therefore, there is a need for understanding the mechanisms of PD to aid the development of more effective therapeutics. This endeavor is fueled by genetic discoveries in the past two decades that identified a number of genes associated with rare inheritable PD, including SNCA, Parkin/PRKN, DJ-1/Park7, PINK1, and LRRK2 (leucine-rich repeat kinase 2) (3). The push now is to understand the functions of these gene products and the biological pathways in which they operate. In PNAS, Beilina et al. identify a number of LRRK2 interactors whose jobs are to process endocytosed vesicles, thereby associating LRRK2 with the vesicle endocytosis pathways (4).",

      "abstract": "The basal ganglia comprise a group of gray matter structures beneath the cerebral cortex, that surrounds the thalamus and hypothalamus. The basal ganglia play an important role in controlling movement. The motor circuits within the striato-pallidal complex are thought to facilitate desired movement and inhibit unwanted movement through their influence, via the thalamus, mainly on cortical precentral motor regions. Localized damage to parts of the basal ganglia occurs in certain diseases such as Parkinson's disease. Parkinsonism is a common neurological disorder that affects about one person in every 1,000 of the general population and about 2% in the elderly. The diagnosis of Parkinson's disease is based on the presence of two or more of the major symptoms: tremor, rigidity, postural instability, and bradykinesia. The pathological process behind the motor disabilities of Parkinsonism is a progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra, that results in dopamine depletion in the striatum. Brain dopamine deficiency is sufficient to explain all of the major symptoms of Parkinson's disease.",

There is major depression, sometimes referred to as psychotic or endogenous depression, mania and bipolar or manic depression. Any extreme of mood may be associated with psychosis in which thinking may become irrational and delusional. Since drug therapy should be based upon symptomatology and not on diagnosis this should not cause problems. However, it has sometimes been rather difficult to differentiate clearly manic depression from schizophrenia and the boundaries may merge. In typical cases the distinction is clear. There may also be a tendency for the nature of the illness to change over the years and the diagnosis may change accordingly. Until the major mental illnesses can be characterised completely in terms of specific disorders in structure or function, diagnosis will need to remain linked to symptoms and treatment. A recent promising beginning is the association of a genetic abnormality with the illness.",

It is increasingly recognized that nonmotor symptoms are common and can adversely affect quality of life, yet they often are not diagnosed and consequently are often untreated. Nonmotor symptoms include neuropsychiatric issues such as anxiety, depression, hallucinations, impulse control disorders, and cognitive impairment, as well as autonomic dysfunction, which may present as gastrointestinal, urinary, and sexual disturbances. Nonmotor symptoms also include excessive sweating, orthostatic hypotension, and sleep disturbances. Management of PD requires recognition of both motor and nonmotor symptoms as well as an understanding of the relationship between these symptoms and how they can be affected by treatments for PD. Therapy should be individualized for each patient, as treatments for the motor symptoms of PD can improve some nonmotor symptoms while they can worsen others. In many cases, symptom-specific treatments are necessary to control nonmotor symptoms of PD.",

Uncommon, complex, and multisystem diseases are commonly misdiagnosed. Two case histories are described, and relevant terms differentiating psychosomatic, somatopsychic, and multisystem illnesses are identified, reviewed, and discussed. Adequate differentiation requires an understanding of the mind/body connection, which includes knowledge of general medicine, psychiatry, and the systems linking the body and the brain. A psychiatric diagnosis cannot be given solely based upon the absence of physical, laboratory, or pathological findings. Medically unexplained symptoms, somatoform disorder, and compensation neurosis are outdated and/or inaccurate terms. The terms subjective, nonspecific, and vague can be used inaccurately. Conversion disorders, functional disorders, psychogenic illness, factitious disorder imposed upon another (Munchausen’s syndrome by proxy), somatic symptom disorder, psychogenic seizures, psychogenic pain, psychogenic fatigue, and delusional parasitosis can be over-diagnosed. Bodily distress disorder and bodily distress syndrome are scientifically unsupported and inaccurate. Many “all in your head” conditions may be related to the microbiome and the immune system. Better education concerning the interface between medicine and psychiatry and the associated diagnostic nomenclature as well as utilizing clinical judgment and thorough assessment, exercising humility, and maintaining our roots in traditional medicine will help to improve diagnostic accuracy and patient trust.",

      "abstract": "FOR MOST PARENTS their child's first convulsion is a dramatic, frightening event which demands immediate medical attention. The physician, on the other hand, may see the patient after recovery from the attack and may tend to minimize the severity of the situation and assume a wait-and-see attitude before investigation and treatment are initiated. The convulsion is a symptom that indicates a disturbance of cerebral neurones. This disturbance may be the result of underlying organic disease of the brain, either fixed or progressive, or it may be an indication of a functional disturbance related to a circulatory or metabolic disorder. The first attack may be so mild that the child is unaffected but subsequent attacks may be prolonged, or result in status epilepicus, and produce a mild or severe degree of mental impairment. There is considerable evidence to indicate that anoxia associated with convulsions can cause brain damage and for this reason every child who has had a convulsion should be investigated and, with rare exception, placed on prophylactic daily anticonvulsant medication when no specific treatable condition is discovered. EVALUATION The first step in the study of a child who has a convulsion is to document its occurrence. Anxious parents are, as a rule, poor witnesses. Despite this, every effort should be made to obtain a description of the seizure, particularly premonitory symptoms, loss of consciousness, convulsive movements, duration of the attack, and the state of the patient following the attack. In infants breath-holding spells may simulate convulsive seizures. In breath-holding spells there is always a precipitating factor, usually a slight injury or some emotional disturbance which results in violent crying, ending suddenly in respiratory apnea. The cyanosis in such attacks appears before the loss of consciousness and convulsive movements.",

      "abstract": "Chapter 52 discusses Parkinson’s plus syndrome, which refers to a group of neurodegenerative disorders with the common feature of parkinsonism not due to Lewy body pathology. Some of the conditions, such as multiple-system atrophy, are synucleinopathies, whereas others, such as progressive supranuclear palsy, are tauopathies. Generally, other neurologic manifestations are present in addition to parkinsonism, such as dysautonomia, cerebellar dysfunction, oculomotor abnormalities, and dementia. Sleep disorders are common in many of these conditions.",

Desarrollo. Se revisa lo mas relevante acerca de los sintomas no motores sensoriales en la EP: alteraciones visuales, disfuncion olfatoria, alteraciones del gusto, hipoacusia y otros trastornos auditivos, y dolor y sintomas sensitivos asociados. Conclusiones. El dolor es un sintoma muy prevalente e infradiagnosticado en la EP, siendo muy importante su identificacion y tipificacion para un correcto tratamiento. La hiposmia es un sintoma muy frecuente que podria utilizarse como marcador precoz de la EP. Diversas alteraciones visuales y auditivas deben tenerse en cuenta igualmente en los pacientes con EP.",

Dopamine is a neurotransmitter involved in movement, motivation, memory, and other functions; its level is decreased in the PD brain due to dopaminergic cell death. Lack of this vital substrate in the parkinsonian brain is a motor impairment abnormality and possibly a reason for the cognitive deficit seen in parkinsonian patients. Biomarkers are measurable and reproducible parameters that make it possible to identify physiological and pathological processes. They must be specific, easy to obtain, and reproducible. Some are capable of diagnosing Parkinson's disease whose symptoms have not yet been described. This is where its usefulness lies in the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, since this disease, by the time it presents symptoms, already shows neuronal damage and the therapeutic approach can only delay its progression.",

Elle est caracterisee par la destruction des neurones dopaminergiques des noyaux gris centraux et par la presence de corps de Lewy au niveau des neurones dopaminergiques restants. Les symptomes de cette maladie sont multiples, avec des manifestations motrices (triade parkinsonienne : tremblement, rigidite et lenteur des mouvements) et non motrices (dont font partie les troubles psychiques).La cause de la Maladie de Parkinson reste encore inconnue. Il existe neanmoins plusieurs hypotheses. La theorie du stress oxydatif, est a ce jour l'hypothese la plus defendue, avec une implication environnementale et genetique. La dopamine est au coeur du processus lesionnel de la Maladie de Parkinson. Le traitement mis en place aura pour objectif de la remplacer ou de diminuer sa degradation. Cependant, comme la dopamine ne peut pas traverser la barriere hemato-encephalique, c'est son precurseur levogyre, la levodopa (ou L-Dopa) qui sera utilisee. Le traitement de la Maladie de Parkinson a une base medicamenteuse, mais il ne faut pas oublier les techniques de reeducation fonctionnelle et de readaptation (kinesitherapie, orthophonie et ergotherapie), qui occupent une place fondamentale au sein de la strategie therapeutique. Actuellement, de nombreux espoirs sont fondes sur la recherche du fait qu'il n'existe pas encore de traitement curatif. La recherche avance ainsi dans toutes les directions : genetique, cellules souches, chirurgie, nouvelles formes medicamenteuses et nouveaux medicaments.Dans une derniere partie, les resultats d'une enquete realisee aupres de personnes atteintes de la Maladie de Parkinson en Lorraine seront analyses.

      "title": "Association between chronic insomnia and depression in elderly adults",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is not just a common symptom of various psychiatric or physical disorders, but is itself categorized as a primary psychiatric disorder. Aside from the manifestations of difficulty initiating sleep, fragmented sleep, early-morning wakenings, and overall poor sleep efficiency, the subjective feeling of inadequate or non-restorative sleep the next morning, as well as psychosocial distress or dysfunction caused, are even more crucial in the diagnosis of insomnia.1,2 The duration of insomnia required for diagnosis as “chronic” has varied from as little as 1 month to as long as 6 months, depending upon the criteria used. The increased incidence of chronic insomnia has been related to concomitant medical and psychiatric disorders, which are frequently present among the elderly. When insomnia becomes chronic, it will invariably increase medical problems significantly, and impact a patient's quality of life, cognitive and psychosocial function adversely,1,2 while further exaggerating the already existing psychiatric or medical conditions. Somatic comorbidities associated with aging are known to be risk factors for insomnia and depression. Therefore, chronic insomnia will further aggravate the heavy burden of medically ill elderly patients and their caregivers.3,4 The prevalence of insomnia among the general adult population is approximately 6% to 30%.2,5 Furthermore, an estimated 50% to 70% of all people aged ≥65 years have reported at least one condition of chronic sleep disturbances.4 A study conducted in one district of metropolitan Taipei, Taiwan has shown that nearly half of the elderly reported suffering from insomnia and poor sleep quality, and 22% of elderly subjects used medication for sleep, numbers that are consistent with results of previous studies in other countries.6 In this study, 7% of the elderly have possible depression. The severity of depression has also been found to be a significant factor related to their insomnia and sleep quality.6 Major depressive disorder (MDD) and insomnia are closely and multifacetedly related, and they pose a bidirectional relationship.7 The interplay between these psychopathologies is not fully understood; however, their functional relationship has become a focus of recent investigation.8,9 By using self-rating scales, epidemiological surveys have demonstrated the significant association between chronic insomnia and depression in young adults, as well as in elderly populations.3,9 Insomnia is the major complaint among those patients with MDD, and about 40% to 80% of such patients complained of insomnia, or poor sleep quality. In addition to being a symptom of MDD, insomnia has also been suggested as a primary disorder comorbid with MDD.7 Conversely, depression has been found to be over-represented in individuals with chronic insomnia, and the severity of depression is significantly associated with nonrestorative sleep and decreased total sleep duration.8 The severity and duration of depression will be exaggerated if patient depression is combined with chronic insomnia. Several longitudinal studies have shown that insomnia can be a risk factor of, and a precursor to new-onset depression; it can also increase the likelihood of a recurrence or relapse of MDD episodes in the following years.7,10 The close relationship between insomnia and depression is also observed in the elderly. The insomnic elderly, by a factor of three to seven times, were more likely to develop depression during later years, compared to control subjects who did not suffer from insomnia. Sleep disturbance was also associated with more severe and later onset depression, where elderly patients with depression had longer nocturnal awakenings, poor sleep efficiency, and poor neuro-psychological functioning comparing to the control group.11 Therefore, patients with insomnia should be carefully evaluated for the presence of comorbid depression, which can facilitate the early detection and management of insomnia as a way to reduce the risk of MDD.11 When insomnia is comorbid with MDD, the relative improvement seen in both disorders can be enhanced if they are treated with a hypnotic along with an antidepressant. One survey revealed that a greater rate (21%) of patients with chronic insomnia received antidepressants, compared to those patients (8%) who did not suffer from chronic insomnia.3 Besides depression, sleep problems are also more prevalent in elderly dementia patients than in controls.4 In a cohort group of elderly patients suffering from dementia, about one-third suffered from insomnia, and roughly 20% to 25% reported being affected by sleep-related leg cramps, restless leg syndrome, or rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorders. More than 60% of hospitalized patients with dementia of the Alzheimer-type were observed suffering different sleep disorders.12 These sleep disorders, which occurred at a higher frequencies than in the general elderly population, suggest that neuro-degeneration probably play a crucial role in the pathophysiology of insomnia in the elderly. Among the elderly, sleep disorders were found to be closely associated with depression and anxiety.4 In a postal community survey of adult insomniacs, there has been a reported increase in healthcare use, with the primary reason given as “difficulty in falling asleep.” Correspondingly, “wakes up tired” is the reason often given by insomniacs if insomnia is combined with anxiety or depression.3 About 9% to 26% of those patients with insomnia used sleep medications, which included subjects in the Taiwan survey.5,6,13,14 At present, pharmacological intervention remains the treatment of choice, and the use of hypnotics is significantly associated with elderly female patients with depression-like symptoms, suffering from poor sleep quality and complaining of difficulty falling asleep.5,15 Elderly status and poor sleep control were the strongest predictors for the use of medication, and for subsequent difficulty in quitting sleep medications.15 Both benzodiazepine and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics have been the most frequently used drugs for treating insomnia in the elderly in Taiwan.14 Most of the clinical trials of hypnotics in insomnia are of short duration, and the long-term effects, tolerance, and abuse liability of hypnotics require further study. The potential for abuse liability from these benzodiazepine hypnotics appears to be minimal in the elderly, and nonbenzodiazepine hypnotics also may have diminished abuse liability potential as well. In Taiwan, older individuals are less likely to receive a higher dosage benzodiazepine therapy, but more likely to receive more prolonged therapy.13 Furthermore, elderly patients with concomitant anxiety or depression consumed more hypnotics.13 Elderly patients are at risk for a variety of sleep disorders that are most often comorbid with other medical and psychiatric illnesses. Chronic insomnia has a complex relationship with depression, such that sleep disturbance, cognitive decline, and late-onset depression may share common neurobiological underpinnings. In elderly patients with chronic insomnia, the early detection and treatment of depression must be promoted. If insomnia coexists with depression, both symptoms or disorders may be highly associated with the constant use of hypnotics. Therefore, a combined use of antidepressants should be considered for achieving a more satisfactory improvement in elderly patients.

      "abstract": "Although the pathophysiology of depression is not fully understood in either primary depression (i.e., no known neuropathology related to depression) or secondary depression (i.e., neuropathologic disorder that leads to depres sion), a number of studies have begun to identify aspects of the pathophysiology of both primary and secondary depression. This article reviews the findings of studies examining the pathophysiology of depression following stroke, Parkinson's disease, or Huntington's disease and compares them to findings in primary depression. Studies exam ining glucose metabolic rates or blood flow changes in regional brain areas found that stroke, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease, as well as primary depression, were all associated with decreased activity or brain lesions in the orbital frontal cortex and basal ganglia. There were also abnormalities noted in the basal temporal lobes, cingulate cortex, and thalamus in some but not all disorders. Studies in stroke have also noted depletions of sero tonin receptors in left temporal cortex associated with depression. These findings are consistent with the hypothesis that the pathophysiology of secondary and primary depression involves the dysfunction of one or more of the corti cal-basal ganglia-thalamic neuronal loops. This dysfunction may be mediated by decreased serotonin release. These studies may ultimately lead to more focused and specific treatments. (J Geriatr Psychiatry Neurol 1999; 12:128-136).",

      "title": "The need for neuroprotective therapies in Parkinson’s disease",
      "abstract": "Slowing of disease progression remains a major unmet need in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). Multiple factors are responsible for progression of disability in this disorder including worsening of cardinal motor features due to progressive nigral pathology, the evolution of poorly levodopa-responsive symptoms like freezing, postural instability and falls as well as motor complications of sustained treatment with levodopa. In addition, non-motor symptoms including cognitive decline, autonomic failure, sleep disorders and pain become increasingly prevalent with advancing disease and add to the overall burden of this disease. So far no treatment has been shown to significantly retard the progression of overall disability, and neuroprotective trials have been limited by design issues and a narrow focus on rates of decline of motor scores or imaging markers of nigrostriatal dysfunction only. Current evidence suggests that it may soon be possible to define populations at increased risk to develop PD and thus to target the \"preclinical\" phase of PD for neuroprotection. Such future trials will test intervention for their ability to prevent or retard the development of clinically overt PD in at-risk individuals.",

Besides idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (IPD) secondary parkinsonism, monogenetic Parkinson’s disease and atypical syndromes need to be differentiated. The prevalence in the European population is estimated to be approximately 1 %. Lifestyle and age are closely linked to IPD. Neurodegeneration with formation of Lewy-bodies and increased oxidative stress in the pars compacta of the substantia nigra are closely linked to IPD. Lewy-bodies show misfolded α-Synuclein. The balance of glutamate, GABA and dopamine is essential for motor complications. Bradykinesia/akinesia, rigidity, rest tremor and postural instability are typical symptoms along with dissymmetry, shuffling gait and camptocormia, micrographia, aphasia, hypophonia, dysphagia, and hypomimia. Early symptoms are akathisia/restlessness, insomnia, somnolence, hyposmia and neck pain. With further progression of IPD, neurons of the ventral tegmental area are affected and lead to non-motor symptoms, which hence are directly related to the underlying disease. Gastric dysmotility, depression, urinary incontinence, excessive sweating, hallucinations, spasticity, muscle pain and Parkinson’s disease dementia are part of IPD.",

      "abstract": "Depression, anxiety and apathy are distinct neuropsychiatric symptoms that highly overlap in Parkinson's disease (PD). It remains unknown whether each symptom is uniquely associated with a functional network dysfunction. Here, we examined whether individual differences in each neuropsychiatric symptom predict functional connectivity patterns in PD patients while controlling for all other symptoms and motor function. Resting-state functional connectivity MRI were acquired from 27 PD patients and 29 healthy controls. Widespread reduced functional connectivity was identified in PD patients and explained by either the neuropsychiatric or motor symptoms. Depression in PD predicted increased functional connectivity between the orbitofrontal, hippocampal complex, cingulate, caudate and thalamus. Apathy in PD predicted decreased caudate-thalamus and orbitofrontal-parahippocampal connectivity. Anxiety in PD predicted three distinct types of functional connectivity not described before: (i) increased limbic-orbitofrontal cortex; (ii) decreased limbic-dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and orbitofrontal-dorsolateral prefrontal cortices and (iii) decreased sensorimotor-orbitofrontal cortices. The first two types of functional connectivity suggest less voluntary and more automatic emotion regulation. The last type is argued to be specific to PD and reflect an impaired ability of the orbitofrontal cortex to guide goal-directed motor actions in anxious PD patients.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Parkinson’s disease (PD) is one of the most widespread neurodegenerative diseases. PD is associated with progressive loss of substantia nigra dopaminergic neurons, including various motor symptoms (e.g., bradykinesia, rigidity, and resting tremor), as well as non-motor symptoms (e.g., cognitive impairment, constipation, fatigue, sleep disturbance, and depression). PD involves multiple biological processes, including mitochondrial or lysosomal dysfunction, oxidative stress, insulin resistance, and neuroinflammation. Metabolic syndrome (MetS), a collection of numerous connected cerebral cardiovascular conditions, is a common and growing public health problem associated with many chronic diseases worldwide. MetS components include central/abdominal obesity, systemic hypertension, diabetes, and atherogenic dyslipidemia. MetS and PD share multiple pathophysiological processes, including insulin resistance, oxidative stress, and chronic inflammation. In recent years, MetS has been linked to an increased risk of PD, according to studies; however, the specific mechanism remains unclear. Researchers also found that some related metabolic therapies are potential therapeutic strategies to prevent and improve PD. This article reviews the epidemiological relationship between components of MetS and the risk of PD and discusses the potentially relevant mechanisms and recent progress of MetS as a risk factor for PD. Furthermore, we conclude that MetS-related therapies are beneficial for the prevention and treatment of PD.",

Here, we describe 5 patients who presented with leg restlessness as an early manifestation of PD. In case 1, the patient had leg restlessness that was not LMR or RLS and preceded the onset of motor symptoms by 1 year. In case 2, LMR preceded motor symptoms by 2 years. Case 3 had unilateral RLS symptoms on the left side of the body for 33 years. Two and a half years after the spread of RLS symptoms to the right leg with increased frequency of left-sided RLS symptoms, the patient developed PD at the age of 58 years. In cases 4 and 5, RLS symptoms preceded motor symptoms by 3 months and 1 month, respectively. All patients developed Parkinsonism within 3 years (median, 1.0 year; range 0.083–2.5 years) after initial onset or exacerbation of leg restlessness. All patients had frequent leg restlessness symptoms (6–7 days per week). In our series, the preceding leg restlessness was unilateral and confined to the dominant side of the subsequent Parkinsonism, or preceding leg restlessness was bilateral but dominant on the dominant side of the subsequent Parkinsonism. Clinicians should be aware that late-onset leg restlessness (&gt;50 years of age) including RLS, LMR, and OLR, particularly if frequent and asymmetrical, can be an early nonmotor manifestation of PD.",

      "title": "Beyond the Dopaminergic System: Lessons Learned from levodopa Resistant Symptoms in Parkinson's Disease",
      "abstract": "Diagnosis and clinical burden in people with Parkinson's disease (PD) is often related to the cardinal motor features (tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity) and occurs when at least 40–60% of striatal dopamine nerve terminals are lost.1 However, in the \"Essay on the shaking palsy\" James Parkinson already reported presence of constipation, cognitive dysfunction or sleep disorders in addition to motor involvement.2 With the introduction of l-dopa therapy it became evident that only specific clinical features would improve while many others would show limited or no benefit from medications even if they significantly contribute to quality of life decline and disability. In recent years the detection of pathological hallmarks in many tissues beyond the central nervous system has supported the concept that PD is a systemic multi-organ condition where dopamine is less centric and various neurotransmitters and pathways are involved. In the prodromal phase (the time between onset of neurodegeneration and occurrence of motor symptoms), orthostatic hypotension (OH), constipation, hyposmia, rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD), pain and neuropsychiatric symptoms (ie, subtle frontal lobe deficits and depression) may be observed.3 Severe autonomic dysfunction and cognitive impairment significantly contribute to clinical deterioration in the advanced disease stages.4 In this Viewpoint, we aimed to challenge the traditional vision of PD motor and non-motor dichotomy. We have reviewed the most relevant PD features and the respective neurotransmitters' systems involved, suggesting a categorization based on response to dopamine replacement therapy. We believe these considerations are relevant in light of the possibility to detect and possibly treat the disease years before motor manifestations (Fig. 1). Innervation in the retina (especially around the fovea) is mainly dopaminergic, and therefore vision dysfunction is common in PD. It is often expressed as difficulties in color and contrast vision during off periods which may benefit from treatment optimization.5 Diplopia is often not corrected by dopaminergic treatment and it may develop from a combination of convergence insufficiency and exophoria. Shoulder pain is frequently reported at onset of motor manifestations but this is generally secondary to limb rigidity and progressively improves once dopaminergic therapy is established.5 Bradykinesia and rigidity usually present a satisfying and sustained response to l-dopa while rest-tremor may be more difficult to treat in some patient.6 Medications-related fluctuations, wearing off and dyskinesias develop after a few years of therapy in patients with good response to l-dopa. Variability in brain dopamine levels secondary to intermittent l-dopa administration, heterogeneous gastrointestinal function and absorption, progressive loss of dopamine nerve terminals and storage capacity contribute to the development of these symptoms.7, 8 Therapeutic strategies aiming at more constant drug delivery and dopamine receptor stimulation are helpful and if started early, may minimize the severity of motor complications.7 The dopaminergic pathway plays a key role in the regulation of the genitourinary system. Dopamine selectively inhibits or activates the pontine micturition center, explaining the frequent urinary symptoms in PD. Optimizing dopaminergic treatment may help in the management of the urinary urgency secondary to detrusor overactivity in PD.5 However, early occurrence of urinary urgency and bladder dysfunction may also express more rapid disease progression and deserves careful assessment by treating physicians. l-dopa non-responsive symptoms are common and may be observed already at prodromal phase. They are generally related to either misfolded alpha-synuclein accumulation in various tissues including the dopamine pathways (structural alterations) or consequence of dysfunctions affecting other neurotransmitters (functional alterations). Olfactory dysfunction occurs months or years before motor onset and it is associated with fourfold increase in risk of PD within 4–10 years9 However, it is often overlooked by clinicians and patients, and sometimes is confused with the physiological age-related olfactory decline. The lack of response to l-dopa supports the concept that hyposmia is not related to the dopamine system and generally does not follow a parallel progression with motor decline.10 Abnormalities have been observed in the central olfactory structures, whereas the involvement of the peripheral olfactory system is less defined. Lewy bodies are commonly found in these regions, supporting the hypothesis of pathology starting in the periphery then extending to the brain.10, 11 Since the olfactory system directly links the brain to the external environment, it could be a gateway through which many viruses, including novel coronavirus, could trigger inflammation and ultimately promote neurodegenerative processes.12 Constipation is another common PD risk factor. There is increasing interest regarding the role of the gut–brain axis, and both alpha-synuclein aggregates and reactive enteric gliosis have been detected in nerve fibers of the duodenal mucosa, in both early and advanced PD.13-15 In addition, presence of constipation is associated with faster progression and involves the cholinergic system.16 Finally, alterations in the gut microbiota composition are also well documented supporting interventions modulating gut microbiota.17 Generalized painful sensations or dystonic pain may develop in patients with motor fluctuations, off periods and peak-dose dyskinesias, as well as in association to restless legs syndrome or periodic limb movement. Given the key role of dopamine in mediating several pain networks in the central nervous system (spinal cord, thalamus, basal ganglia, cingulate cortex), advanced patients suffering from pain often benefit from an optimized dopaminergic therapy.5 However, many patients suffer from neuropathic and central pain independently from motor complications suggesting involvement of other neurotransmitters including glutamate, norepinephrine and serotonin. A broader approach to pain management that considers multiple drugs including opiate is warranted given its relevance to quality of life.18 Mild cognitive deficits in executive functions, working memory, attention, difficulties in planning and problem solving are common early PD features. Dementia is reported in PD with long survival and its occurrence is underpinned by cholinergic dysfunction, diffuse Lewy body pathology and frequently associated with amyloid pathology in elderly patients.19 Rivastigmine, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, may improve executive function, attention and behavioral symptoms in PD patients with dementia suggesting a role for cholinergic drugs. Presence of different regional patterns of cholinergic dysfunction may explain various l-dopa unresponsive features including cognitive decline.20 Gait difficulties and postural instability are amongst the most disabling PD features and often overlap with cognitive impairment resulting in rapid loss of autonomy and worsening quality of life. The unsatisfying response to dopaminergic treatment and device aided therapies suggests involvement of non-dopaminergic networks and nuclei.21 Abnormal striatal plasticity and pharmacodynamic changes in dopaminergic transmission are the neurobiological substrates of dyskinesia. l-dopa treatment determines internalization of A2A-D2 heteromers and compensatory upregulation of A2A homomers, ultimately leading to an impaired firing pattern in the striato-pallidal pathway.22 Hence, management of dyskinesia is challenging and requires a diversified treatment targeting different neurotransmitters especially glutamatergic modulation (ie, amantadine, a NMDA receptor antagonist) or implementation of device aided therapies. Strategies targeting serotonin have not been successful in patients although animal models suggest a role for this neurotransmitter in the development of dyskinesia. Psychosis is characterized by hallucinations, delusions (false beliefs against contrary knowledge) and delirium. They occur in the context of cognitive decline and dementia but may be also triggered by dopaminergic therapy.23 Modulation of dopaminergic therapy along with use of atypical antipsychotic medications including pimavanserin (currently available only in the USA) should represent the treatment of choice, as older antipsychotic medications often led to worsening of motor manifestations. Impulsivity and ICD are more common in patients on DA replacement treatment especially dopamine agonists.24-26 This supports the notion that ICD is related to dopaminergic dysfunction and can be managed only by modulation of dopamine replacement therapy. OH has an estimated prevalence ranging from 30–65% of PD patients. It is reported occasionally as a prodromal feature but more frequently detected across all stages of the disease. The main role played by noradrenaline in modulating the autonomic function explains why the disruption of the noradrenergic pathways in PD underlines the cardiovascular abnormalities including OH. Extracardiac, and more importantly, cardiac sympathetic denervation are frequently associated with additional dysfunction in the parasympathetic compartment and impaired baroreflex.27 To date, a standardized approach to OH is lacking and the relationship between dopamine and OH is still debated,28 together with the inclusion of OH among potential side effects of levodopa and dopamine agonists, non-pharmacological treatments are often recommended as the first choice. These manifestations result from the complex interplay between multiple neurotransmitter systems, and may partially benefit from dopaminergic treatment. Indeed, this category comprises manifestations presenting motor, cognitive and behavioral components, likely reflecting the involvement of multiple anatomical and neurochemical circuits. RBD is a strong risk factor and predictor of PD and other synucleinopathies (25–40% at 5 years, 40–65% at 10 years).13, 29 Several neuroimaging and functional studies support the role of dopaminergic dysfunction and nigrostriatal degeneration in the genesis of RBD although the involvement of other neurotransmitters is likely since RBD is often unresponsive to dopaminergic treatment alone.30 RBD generally occurs many years before motor manifestations and the role of noradrenergic depletion of the locus coeruleus has been documented by many studies.31 In support of this hypothesis, a recent study suggested the efficacy of safinamide, a medication with both dopaminergic and nondopaminergic actions (inhibition of monoamine oxidase-B, modulation of glutamate release) in improving symptoms related to RBD.32 Depression or depression-related symptoms are listed among the criteria for Prodromal PD.33 The presence of comorbid anxiety disorders is also common and may occur as a separate entity or in relation to motor fluctuations especially during the off periods. In addition to dopamine, extra-striatal pathology and degeneration in the serotonergic and noradrenergic afferent pathways from the midbrain play an important role in PD depression.34 In addition, reactive behavioral patterns, symptoms occurring during motor worsening or as drug adverse effects, need to be considered when approaching treatment. There is no randomized clinical trials on the antidepressant effects of l-dopa and one randomized placebo controlled study documenting the effect of pramipexole.35 However, in some PD patients depressive symptoms may not benefit from dopaminergic therapy and they require additional drugs targeting the serotonergic and/or noradrenergic system especially if anxiety or apathetic features are present.5 Apathy can be observed alone or in association with depression or anxiety. A prominent dopaminergic and noradrenergic dysregulation are relevant causative factors in determining apathy and should both be considered when introducing treatment. Apathy may also be a strong predictor of cognitive decline and its persistence should require careful monitoring of neuropsychological skills.36 An increasing body of work supports the view of PD as a systemic condition with multiple organs and neurotransmitters involved and where symptoms poorly addressed by l-dopa therapy have a key role on quality of life, autonomy and functional decline.5, 37 Moreover, l-dopa resistant symptoms constitute a major target for advanced and palliative treatments in the late stage of disease.38 Given the traditional focus on dopamine, many of these manifestations are often overlooked although they significantly impact on the global progression of the disease, life expectancy and on the cost of care.5 Indeed patients presenting early multidomain cognitive impairment or RBD may suffer more rapid physical decline as opposed to individuals who manifest predominant mild motor and mood dysfunction where disease course is generally more benign. Similar prominent early autonomic deficits including OH and constipation have been associated with worse prognosis, higher risk of cognitive impairment, functional decline and death.39 Overall these findings support the redefinition of PD as a systemic neurodegenerative process involving different systems but with different rates of degeneration and progression. l-dopa unresponsive symptoms present a heterogeneous progression pattern, that does not mirror classic and well-documented motor decline. Identification and tracking of those symptoms should parallel motor evaluation to properly define prognosis.37, 39 The neuropathological hallmarks of many l-dopa unresponsive features might be related to alpha synuclein misfolding and aggregation involving various neurotransmitters and functional networks in addition to nigrostriatal dopamine neurons.11 Indeed, the presence of overlapping pathological processes (amyloid and Tau) or concomitant cerebrovascular disease is increasingly relevant and documents the heterogeneity of the disease and the need of more patient centric therapeutic approaches. Current \"clinical markers\" of disease are heavily weighted towards the nigrostriatal dopaminergic system but we believe the objective of pharmacological research should expand to other neurotransmitter systems, particularly on compounds targeting serotoninergic, glutamatergic and purinergic pathways. Our suggestion is that a new approach to PD diagnosis and management beyond dopamine replacement therapy should be rapidly adopted, encompassing all clinical features and addressing their contribution to early disease detection, prognosis, progression and quality of life. Recent discoveries in disease biomarkers indicate that it is important to change our dopamine-centric perspective for PD diagnosis if we want to test and possibly implement disease modifying therapies before motor symptoms become manifest.40 Figure 1 was created with BioRender.com.

These conditions do not, on the whole, respond to therapy as well as does Parkinson's disease, and their ‘atypical’ nature may become clearer through a lack of response to levodopa (L-dopa).",

Up to 46 % of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) suffer from depression. deteriorates the course of PD and has great impact on quality of life. Common risk factors for depression in PD are: young age, early onset of PD, female gender, increasing disability, akinesia, anxiety and psychotic symptoms. Diagnosis of depression in PD is often difficult, since there is a big overlap of the symptomatology of both, PD and depression. Physicians have to pay special attention to depressive symptoms in PD. The pathophysiological background of depression in PD might be a dysbalance of dopaminergic, noradrenergic and serotoninergic neurotransmission. Despite the great importance of treatment of depression in PD, there are only limited informations for treatment of depression in PD available, especially regarding evidence based medicine.

In addition to the above motor symptoms, nonmotor manifestations are increasingly recognized as part of Parkinson's disease pathology and contribute to overall symptom burden, morbidity, and mortality. Such nonmotor symptoms include autonomic dysfunction, impaired olfaction, gastrointestinal disturbances, and a variety of psychiatric symptoms including psychosis. Psychiatric symptoms may be inherent to the disease process itself, secondary to treatments aimed at restoring dopamine, or related to comorbid mental illness. Given that traditional medications used to treat psychosis are dopaminergic antagonists, pharmacologic treatment of these symptoms carries the risk of worsening the movement disorder, creating a challenge for providers. This review examines current literature regarding psychosis in the context of Parkinson’s disease including risk factors for psychosis, prognosis, and management of these challenging symptoms.

      "abstract": "Whether the experience, symptoms, treatment or neuropathology of Parkinson's disease (PD) could potentially play a role in shaping religious beliefs and practices can be viewed from several different angles. For example, a diagnosis of a serious illness could make one reassess and question previously held attitudes and beliefs; faith in a benign God may be challenged. Spirituality, broadly defined as a quest for meaning and truth, could also play a role in the process of integrating the experience of living with Parkinson's disease, as with any disease or major life experience. Less conscious mechanisms might also be in play, more intrinsic to the disease process, such as loss of motivational drive due to dopaminergic dysfunction. The resulting apathy, which is often seen in PD, might reduce efforts to pursue personal interests, including a religious faith. Cognitive deficits, for example altered social cognition such as changes in 'theory of mind', could also potentially contribute. At a more pragmatic level, problems with decreasing mobility, and energy levels as well as a host of other symptoms and drug side-effects could potentially make all aspects of daily life problematic, therefore impeding the pursuit of religious practices or a spiritual path. In this chapter we review and discuss the existing literature and research, in the hope that it might augment understanding of this little-studied aspect of PD as well as contribute to cognitive perspectives on religious belief and experience.",

      "abstract": "【Parkinson's disease(PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease that affects the functioning of the basal ganglia, a brain area that contributes to the control of movement. The disease is caused by the death of nerve cells in the brain that produce dopamine, a chemical messenger. The cells affected usually produce a neurotransmitter(a chemical that transmits nerver impulses) called dopamine, which acts with acetylcholine, another neurotransmitter, to fine-tune muscle control. In Parkinson's disease, the level of dopamine relative to acetylcholine is reduced, adversely affecting muscle control. When the supply of dopamine is depleted, the function of the basal ganglia is disrupted and its ability to control movement-deteriorates. The result is that PD patients experience moderate rigidity, difficulty in initiating movements and slowness in executing them, and a rhythmical tremor at rest. Although the cause of Parkinson's disease is not known, genetic factors may be involved. About 3 in 10 people with the disorder have an affected family member. About 1 in 100 people over the age of 60 in the US have Parkinson's disease. And Parkinson's disease is slightly more common in men. The course of the disease is variable, but drags may be the best effective in treating the symptoms and improving quality of life.

We must observe whether there are symptoms in our patient which can be referred to primary disease of the nervous system. We must examine for hereditary influences, which, when present, lead us, of course, to suspect disease. Early development of the appetite for stimulants points in the same direction; but the great diagnostic mark attending the<i>disease</i>is the irresistible impulse or craving, by which the patient is impelled to",

It covers the history and prevalence of PD, the disease process and its symptoms (motor and non-motor), disease diagnosis, the stages of Parkinson’s, rates of progression, and treatment approaches. Although no form of treatment stops the disease process, there are treatments that can ease its symptoms. These approaches include pharmacological options, such as carbidopa/levodopa; technological devices, surgical interventions, such as deep brain stimulation; and lifestyle practices, such as regular vigorous exercise. The latter has also been shown to slow disease progression. The chapter concludes with a description of current and future research into treating and possibly stopping the progression of Parkinson’s disease.",

      "title": "Nonmotor symptoms in dystonia",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION Discussion of nonmotor features in the fi eld of movement disorders has largely focused on Parkinson's disease (PD). In PD nonmotor phenomena have been characterized in relationship to the time course of disease, and in some instances to its pathophysiology. These nonmotor features are common in PD and have a signifi - cant impact on quality of life (QoL). The presence of such symptoms as cognitive dysfunction, psychiatric symptoms (psychosis, depression, anxiety, apathy, and poor impulse control), sensory phenomena (pain, restless leg syndrome, and akathisia), fatigue, and autonomic dysfunction have been so important as to lead to the development of a nonmotor unifi ed PD rating scale. The occurrence of nonmotor features in dystonia is not as well established, and the body of research on this topic is limited. While both disorders are due to abnormalities in the basal ganglia, they differ in that PD is neurodegenerative while primary dystonia is not. This may explain, at least partially, why PD manifests such fl orid nonmotor phenomena by comparison. Nevertheless, in light of the widespread connections among basal ganglia, sensory cortex, thalamus, limbic structures, and brainstem, it would appear likely that primary dystonia could also manifest some nonmotor symptoms. This chapter will focus on nonmotor features associated with the primary dystonias and review fi ve areas: cognitive functioning, psychiatric symptoms, sleep disorders, pain, and somatosensory changes, and the nonmotor hallmark of dystonia, sensory tricks.",

      "title": "Poor insight in psychosis and meta-representation models",
      "abstract": "Historically, poor insight and self-awareness deficits in schizophrenia have typically been understood as stemming from psychological defenses or adaptive coping strategies. Perhaps both psychological process and neuropsychological deficit account for the phenomenon of poor insight. Different models of insight exist for different broad categories of mental disorders, like psychotic, neurotic, and neurological, but investigators have increasingly turned their attention to poor insight, as an important feature in schizophrenia. A variety of phenomena might be considered as reflecting impaired insight in psychosis, like failure to recognize signs, symptoms or disease, failure to derive appropriate cognitive representations, despite recognition of the disease, and misattribution of the source or cause of the disease. The unawareness of tardive dyskinesia symptoms in schizophrenic patients points that self-awareness deficits in schizophrenia may be domain specific. Poor insight is an independent phenomenological and a prevalent feature in psychotic disorders in general, and in schizophrenia in particular, but we don’t know yet if delusions in schizophrenia are the result of an entirely normal attempt to account for abnormal perceptual experiences or a product of abnormal experience but of normal reasoning. The theoretical approaches regarding impaired insight include the disturbed perceptual input, the impaired linkage between thought and emotion and the breakdown of the process of self-monitoring and error checking. The inability to distinguish between internally and externally generated mental events has been described by the meta- representation theory.",

      "title": "Too little or too much nocturnal movements in Parkinson’s disease: A practical guide to managing the unseen",
      "abstract": "Nocturnal and sleep-related motor disorders in people with Parkinson's disease (PD) have a wide spectrum of manifestations and present a complex clinical picture. Problems can arise due to impaired movement ability (hypokinesias), e.g. nocturnal hypokinesia or early-morning akinesia, or to excessive movement (hyperkinesias), e.g. end-of-the-day dyskinesia, parasomnias, periodic limb movement during sleep and restless legs syndrome. These disorders can have a significant negative impact on the sleep, daytime functional ability, and overall quality of life of individuals with PD and their carers. The debilitating motor issues are often accompanied by a combination of non-motor symptoms, including pain and cramping, which add to the overall burden. Importantly, nocturnal motor disorders encompass a broader timeline than just the period of sleep, often starting in the evening, as well as occurring throughout the night and on awakening, and are not just limited to problems of insomnia or sleep fragmentation. Diagnosis can be challenging as, in many cases, the 'gold standard' assessment method is video polysomnography, which may not be available in all settings. Various validated questionnaires are available to support evaluation, and alternative approaches, using wearable sensors and digital technology, are now being developed to facilitate early diagnosis and monitoring. This review sets out the parameters of what can be considered normal nocturnal movement and describes the clinical manifestations, usual clinical or objective assessment methods, and evidence for optimal management strategies for the common nocturnal motor disorders that neurologists will encounter in people with PD in their clinical practice.",

Drooling, dyspepsia, constipation, abdominal pain and fecal incontinence are frequently a source of patient distress. Dysphagia is recognized as causing both discomfort and increased risk of serious complications. Although a diagnosis can often be established based on the reports of patients and/or caregivers, and additional testing is seldom required, these diagnoses are clearly under recognized in clinical practice. These symptoms respond to the same treatment measures used in the general population, although certain drugs with a potential to increase parkinsonian symptoms should be avoided.

Morphologically it is characterized by severe neuronal depletion and gliosis in many brainstem nuclei, in particular the substantia nigra, associated with widespread globose neurofibrillary tangles and tau-positive glial inclusions that are usually immunoreactive for both three- and four-repeat tau isoforms. Postencephalitic parkinsonism shares histopathological features with other tauopathies as a multisystem degeneration with tau-positive neurofibrillary tangles that have biochemical and ultrastructure features similar to Alzheimer's disease while α-synuclein and TDP-43 pathologies are absent. Postencephalitic parkinsonism differs both clinically and morphologically from both idiopathic Parkinson's disease and other tau-related movement disorders.

Parkinson’s disease (PD) is associated with a six fold higher risk of developing dementia when compared to healthy elderly controls and longitudinal studies suggest that up to 78% of Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients will develop dementia after an average of a decade of motor symptoms 1,2 . Potential predictors for the development of dementia in PD include older age at the onset of motor symptoms, bradykinetic, not tremor dominant parkinsonism, bilateral onset of parkinsonism and declining response to levodopa. Depression, visual hallucinations, executive and visuospatial impairments early in the course of PD are putative risk factors for subsequent cognitive decline 3-6 . Operationalised criteria to define the clinical boundaries between PD and PDD are lacking, although this distinction may have profound clinical implications for prognosis and treatment strategies 7 . 8,9 suggest that PD patients who develop dementia more than 12 months after the initial motor symptoms should be diagnosed as PDD rather than DLB. The central feature required for a diagnosis of DLB is progressive cognitive decline, severe enough to cause social and occupational functional impairment. Core features are fluctuating cognition, recurrent and persistent visual hallucinations and extrapyramidal motor symptoms (EPS). Guidelines recommend that two of the core clinical features have to be present for a diagnosis of probable and one for a diagnosis of possible DLB",

      "title": "Bases fisiopatológicas de los síntomas no motores de la enfermedad de Parkinson",
      "abstract": "Introduccion. Los sustratos neuroanatomicos y neuroquimicos de la mayoria de los sintomas no motores (SNM) de la enfermedad de Parkinson (EP) no se conocen en profundidad. Objetivo. Revisar los conocimientos actuales sobre la fisiopatologia de los distintos SNM de la EP sobre la base de estudios recientes. Desarrollo. En la mayoria de los SNM, la base fisiopatologica es compleja. Ademas del papel de la disfuncion dopaminergica, se piensa que la degeneracion de sistemas celulares no dopaminergicos (noradrenergicos, serotoninergicos y colinergicos) subyace al desarrollo de la mayoria de los SNM y esta hipotesis puede aplicarse a la demencia, la depresion, los trastornos del sueno y los trastornos vegetativos. La demencia, ademas, se debe fundamentalmente a diferentes alteraciones que se producen en la corteza cerebral. En el trastorno del espectro impulsivo-compulsivo influye de forma crucial la disfuncion del estriado ventral y de las proyecciones mesolimbicas. La perdida de olfato parece deberse a la degeneracion neuronal del bulbo olfatorio, y el dolor tiene una base patogenica muy variada y puede ser musculoesqueletico, distonico, radicular o central. Conclusiones. A pesar de que se ha producido un gran avance en la investigacion sobre la fisiopatologia de los SNM de la EP son necesarios nuevos estudios comparativos clinicomorfologicos y patobioquimicos para esclarecer las bases fisiopatologicas de la EP y proporcionar una base mas amplia para futuras estrategias terapeuticas de los SNM.",

      "title": "News in treatment of Parkinson's disease",
      "abstract": "Parkinsonova bolest je idiopatski, sporo progredirajuci poremecaj sredisnjeg živcanog sustava koji obilježava sporost i siromastvo pokreta (bradikineza) udružena s jos barem jednim od slijedecih simptoma: povisen tonjus (rigor) misica, tremor u mirovanju i nestabilnost u održavanju položaja tijela. U pocetku simptomi su cesto asimetricni, a bolesnici vrlo dobro reagiraju na terapiju levodopom. Bolest zahvaca oko 1% pucanstva starijeg od 65 godina. Temelj bolesti je propadanje dopaminergicnih neurona u pars compacta substantiae nigre i posljedicna hipoaktivnost dopaminergicnog sustava. Nakon propadanja >50% dopaminergickih neurona u pars compacta substantiae nigre pojavljuju se prvi simptomi. Glavni biokemijski poremecaj Parkinsonove bolesti je hipoaktivnost dopaminergicnog sustava, odnosno smanjenje razine dopamina u nigrostrijatalnom sustavu. Cilj lijecenja Parkinsonove bolesti je postici kontinuiranu stimulaciju dopaminergicnih receptora nigrostrijatalnog sustava. Stoga se u lijecenju Parkinsonove bolesti pokusava: nadomjestiti dopamin primjenom prekursora dopamina – levodopa (dopamin ne prolazi kroz hematoencefalnu barijeru, za razliku od levodope koja je prolazi) s inhibitorima periferne dopa dekarboksilaze (karbidopa ili benzerazid) blokirati razgradnju dopamina – primjenom inhibitora enzima koju razgrađuju dopamin (monoamino oksidaza tipa B (MAO-B) - selegilin, katehol-O-metiltransferaza (COMT) - entakapon direktno stimulirati dopaminergicne receptore – bromokriptin, pramipeksol, ropinirol povecati aktirnost kolinerricnog sustava primjenom antikolinergika – biperidin primjenom amantadima inhibirati NMDA receptore? U terapiji Parkinsonove bolesti primjenjuju se: levodopa s inhibitorima periferne dopa dekarboksilaze: levodopa + karbidopa (Sinemet, Nakom) levodopa + benzerazid (Madopar) COMT inhibitor (Comtan) MAO-B inhibitor (Niar) dopaminergicki agonisti bromokriptin (Bromergon) pramipeksol (Mirapexin) ropinirol (Requip) amantadin (nije dostupan u Hrvatskoj) antikolinergicki lijekovi biperidin (Akineton) Levodopa, metabolicki prekursor dopamina koji prolazi hematoencefalnu barijeru, najucinkovitiji je lijek za Parkinsonovu bolest i l zlatni standardr terapije. Može imati i dijagnosticki znacaj: ako bolesnik ne reagira barem u pocetku bolesti na levodopu, tada vrlo vjerovatno ne boluje od Parkinsonove bolesti. Međutim, dugotrajnom primjenom levodope pojavljuju se komplikacije: diskinezije i fluktuacije u motorickom odgovoru. Postoje i indicije da dugotrajna primjena levodope može dovesti do oksidativnog stresa povecavanjem oksidacije glutationa, peroksidacijom lipida, povecanim stvaranjem hidroksilnih radikala i disfunkcijom respiratornog lanca u mitohondrijima. Za oksidativn stres se pretpostavlja da bi mogao dovoditi do progresije propadanja dopaminergicnih neurona sto bi moglo ubrzavati napredovanje Parkinsonove bolesti i biti odgovorno za komplikacije dugotrajne priomjene levodope. Stoga preparate levodope treba primjenjivati prema principu: low&slow, but go. U Hrvatskoj su dostupni preparati levodope s karbidopom i levodope s benzerazidom, u klasicnom obliku i u pripravcima sa sporim, postupnim, kontroliranim otpustanjem. Dopaminergicki (DA) agonisti se u zadnje vrijeme sve vise propisuju, kako u pocetnim, tako i u uznapredovalim fazama bolesti jer se pokazalo da bi mogli odgoditi pocetak primjene levodope, odgoditi i ublažiti diskineziju i motoricke fluktuacije koje su posljedica primjene levodope, a postoje indicije i o neuroprotektivnom ucinku DA agonista. U studiji CALMPD pokazano je da su bolesnici koji su uzimali pramipeksol imali manje znacajno smanjenje propadanja dopaminergicnih neurona mjereno SPECT-om u usporedbi s bolesnicima koji su uzimali levodopu. Također, u studiji REALPET pokazano je da su bolesnici koji su uzimali ropinirol imali znacajno manje smanjenje propadanja dopaminergicnih neurona mjereno PET-om u usporedbi s bolesnicima koji su uzimali levodopu. U Hrvatskoj je dostupan ergotski DA agonist bromokriptin, te selektivniji, ne-ergotski DA agonisti pramipeksol i ropinirol. DA agoniste je u pocetku terapije potrebno postupno titrirati. U Hrvatskoj je od nedavno dostupan periferni COMT inhibitor entakapon koji sprecava razgradnju levodope i na taj nacin povecava poluvrijeme eliminacije levodope cime dovodi do ublažavanja motorickih fluktuacija povezanih s dugotrajnom primjenom levodope. Primjenom entakapona mogu se umanjiti motoricke fluktuacije i diskineze uzrokovane dugotrajnom primjenom levodope. Selegilin, MAO-B inhibitor, blokira enzimatski put razgradnje dopamina i na taj nacin povecava raspoloživu kolicinu dopamina. Postoje i neke indicije o njegovom neuroprotektivnom djelovanju. Može se primjenjivati kao monoterapija u pocetku bolesti, ili kao dodatak terapiji levodopom. Amantadin je lijek koji nije dostupan u Hrvatskoj, a najcesce se propisuje u pocetnim fazama bolesti. Jos uvijek nije sasvim objasnjen mehanizam njegovog djelovanja, ali se pretpostavlja da djeluje inhibicijom NMDA receptora. Antikolinergici su prvi lijekovi koji su se primjenjivali u lijecenju Parkinsonove boelsti. U primjeni su ve vise do sto godina. Djelotvorni prvenstveno u smirivanju tremora bolesnika, no s obzirom na mnoge nuspojave, sve rjeđe se primjenjuju u terapiji. U Hrvatskoj je na raspolaganju biperidin. U terapiji Parkinsonove bolesti nužno je potreban individualni pristup, za svakog bolesnika ponaosob treba odrediti monoterapiju ili kombinaciju lijekova koji tom bolesniku u određenoj fazi bolesti najbolje djeluju. U pocetnoj fazi bolesti kod mlađih bolesnika terapija se obicno pocinje dopaminergickim agonistom, selegilinom ili amantadinom. U starijih bolesnika (>70 godina) vec u pocetku terapije uvodi se levodopa. S napredovanjem bolesti uvode se novi lijekovi tako da se vecina bolesnika najcesce lijeci kombinacijom navedenih lijekovima.",

      "abstract": "Choroba Parkinsona (PD) jest jedną z najczęściej występujących chorób neurodegeneracyjnych we współczesnym świecie, związaną ze starzejącymi się społeczeństwami. PD jest chorobą postępującą, w której dochodzi do utraty neuronów dopaminowych istoty czarnej (SN) a cechą patologiczną jest obecność ciał Lewy'ego, złożonych m.in. z białka ?-synukleiny. Gdy utrata neuronów w SN przekroczy ok. 60% wówczas pojawiają się główne objawy kliniczne (ruchowe), czyli bradykinezja, sztywność mięśniowa, drżenie spoczynkowe i zaburzenia postawy, chodu. PD jest chorobą o złożonej etiopatogenezie, w której bardzo ważny jest okres przedkliniczny/prodromalny, bowiem pojawiają się wówczas objawy pozaruchowe, np. osłabienie węchu, depresja czy zaburzenia snu, wyprzedzające nawet o kilkanaście lat fazę kliniczną. Niniejsza praca, poza opisem podstawowych informacji na temat PD, skupia się na zaburzeniach snu, wśród których najważniejszym jest zaburzenie zachowania w czasie snu REM, które może stanowić wczesny marker diagnostyczny rozwijającej się choroby, a tym samym pomóc w poszukiwaniu nowych terapii neuroprotekcyjnych już na wczesnym, prodromalnym etapie.",

      "title": "Debilidad neuromuscular aguda, aproximación diagnóstica y terapéutica de un complejo cuadro clínico de etiología variable.",
      "abstract": "La parálisis neuromuscular aguda (PNMA, por sus siglas en inglés) es un síndrome clínico caracterizado por una debilidad muscular de aparición rápida que progresa hasta su máxima gravedad en varios días o semanas (menos de 4 semanas). La debilidad de los músculos bulbares y respiratorios puede estar presente o no. Es uma emergencia neurológica común que requiere investigaciones inmediatas y cuidadosas para determinar la etiología porque um diagnóstico preciso tiene un impacto significativo en la terapia y el pronóstico. La insuficiencia respiratoria causada por debilidad neuromuscular se considera más crítica que la enfermedad pulmonar porque su desarrollo puede ser insidioso o sutil hasta que la descompensación repentina conduce a una hipoxia potencialmente mortal. Además, el hallazgo de gases en sangre arterial de hipoxemia grave, hipercapnia y acidosis puede no ser evidente hasta que la insuficiencia respiratoria es profunda. Por eso, el requisito de assistência respiratoria también debe investigarse de manera intensiva y rápida en todos los pacientes con enfermedad neuromuscular. El trastorno se clasifica según el sitio del defecto en la vía de la unidad motora, es decir, células del asta anterior, raíz nerviosa, nervio periférico, unión neuromuscular o músculo. La identificación de la causa se basa principalmente en una buena historia clínica y un examen clínico detallado complementado con investigaciones neurofisiológicas y, a veces, algunas pruebas de laboratorio específicas. El historial médico y el examen neurológico deben centrarse en el inicio, la progresión, el patrón y la gravedad de la debilidad muscular, así como en las pruebas de los nervios craneales y las pruebas de disfunción autonómica. También deben tenerse en cuenta las características no neurológicas asociadas, como fiebre, erupción cutánea u otras lesiones cutáneas, etc. A nivel mundial, el síndrome de Guillain-Barré es la causa más frecuente de PNMA y representa la mayoría de los casos de debilidad de los músculos respiratorios asociados con trastornos neuromusculares.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease has previously been described as a disorder involving the triad of tremor, bradykinesia and rigidity. Hence its current classification as a movement disorder. Over recent decades, more emphasis has been placed on the so-called non-motor symptoms, which comprise autonomous nervous symptoms, cognitive dysfunction and psychiatric symptoms, such as depression, anxiety, apathy, impulse disorders, hallucinations and psychosis. These latter groups of symptoms can precede disease onset, determine the patient's well-being to a large extent and may provide valuable biomarkers for early diagnosis, treatment response and prognosis. Hence, we propose that Parkinson's disease be classified as a neuropsychiatric disorder.",

      "title": "Endocannabinoide und andere Lipidmediatoren bei Morbus Parkinson-assoziierten Schmerzen : Untersuchung mittels Quantitativer Sensorischer Testung (QST)",
      "abstract": "Morbus Parkinson ist die zweithäufigste neurodegenerativen Erkrankung, die durch Untergang der dopaminergen Neuronen im Mesenzephalon zu einer Störung des extrapyramidalen motorischen Systems führt. Daraus resultierende Bewegungsstörungen, zu denen Rigor, Tremor, Hypokinese und posturale Instabilität gehören, werden von nichtmotorischen Symptomen wie autonome Dysregulation, veränderte sensorische Wahrnehmung, sowie kognitive und psychische Störungen begleitet. Mehrere Studien berichten über erhöhte Schmerzprävalenz bei Parkinson Patienten. Die genaue Pathogenese der gestörten Schmerzwahrnehmung bleibt unklar. Zusätzlich zu den zentralen Mechanismen entstehen die Schmerzen bei Morbus Parkinson wahrscheinlich durch eine Schädigung der peripheren somatosensorischen und autonomen Neuronen, die sich in sensorischen Defiziten, sowie in erhöhter Schmerzempfindlichkeit manifestieren. Als Korrelat dazu wurden abnormale somatosensorisch evozierte Potenziale, pathologische Ergebnisse in der quantitativen sensorischen Testung und eine Abnahme der Nervenfaserdichte beschrieben. Ein Schwerpunkt unserer Untersuchungen lag auf der Erforschung von potentiellen Veränderungen von Lipidsignalmolekülen. Eine Reihe von Studien zeigen eine Schmerzlinderung durch Cannabis-Einnahme, sowie eine Tendenz zur Schmerzentwicklung bei Parkinson Patienten mit dem bekannten FAAHPolymorphismus. Die Ergebnisse deuten darauf hin, dass eine Störung im Endocannabinoid-System höchstwahrscheinlich zu erhöhter Schmerzprävalenz bei Morbus Parkinson beiträgt. Eine weitere wichtige Lipid-Gruppe sind Glycosylceramide. Ihr Abbau kann durch heterozygote Mutationen des lipidabbauenden Enzyms Glukocerebrosidase 1 (GBA1) gestört sein. GBA1 Mutationen sind mit der schnell progredienten sporadischen Verlaufsform der Parkinson-Krankheit assoziiert. Im Rahmen der Studie wurden zwei Kohorten von Parkinson Patienten analysiert. Die 128 Patienten aus Israel wurden im ersten Teil mit 224 jungen gesunden deutschen Probanden verglichen. Im zweiten Teil wurden 50 deutschen Patienten und 50 gesunde altersgleiche Probanden untersucht. Die Schmerzevaluation erfolgte anhand der \"Brief Pain Inventory“ und \"Neuro Detect“ Fragebögen. Bei allen Probanden wurde quantitative sensorische Testung durchgeführt und die Plasmakonzentrationen der Lipidsignalmoleküle mittels quantitativer HPLC-Tandem-Massenspektrometrie analysiert. Nach Auswertung der Schmerzevaluation konnte eine erhöhte Schmerzprävalenz bei Parkinson Patienten festgestellt werden. Die Prävalenz betrug 66% im ersten Teil der Studie und 74% in der deutschen Kohorte, im Vergleich zu 40% bei den altersgleichen gesunden Probanden. Ergebnisse der quantitativen sensorischen Testung zeigen einen Verlust der thermischen Empfindung (erhöhte Schwellen) bei der gleichzeitigen mechanischen Überempfindlichkeit (erniedrigte Schwellen). In der multivariaten LipidAnalyse konnten erniedrigte Konzentrationen von Anandamid und Lysophosphatidsäure 20:4 und eine Erhöhung der Glucosylceramide nachgewiesen werden. Diese Veränderungen waren bei Parkinson Patienten mit Schmerzen stärker ausgeprägt. Außerdem wurde eine lineare Korrelation zwischen Glucosylceramiden (GlcCer 18:1, GlcCer 24:1) und der Schmerzintensität, sowie sensorischem Defizit festgestellt. Nach sorgfältiger Auswertung der Studienergebnisse kommen wir zu der Schlussfolgerung, dass eine Veränderung der Endocannabinoide und der Glucosylceramide zur Pathogenese der Schmerzen und der sensorischen Neuropathie bei Morbus Parkinson beitragen. Die Erkenntnisse könnten zukünftig zur Diagnosestellung durch frühzeitige Erkennung prämotorischer sensorischer Symptome beitragen. Darüber hinaus könnten unsere Ergebnisse zur Therapieoptimierung durch Wiederherstellung der Lipid-Homeostases beitragen.",

Pogađa oko sedam milijuna ljudi diljem svijeta. Cesca je kod muskaraca. Prve simptome bolesti je primjetio Galen, a prvi ih je opisao James Parkinson. Simptomi Parkinsonove bolesti se dijele na motorne (bradikinezija, rigidnost, posturalna nestabilnost i tremor), te na nemotorne (kognitivni poremecaji, promjene autonomnog živcanog sustava, socijalna izolacija). U dijagnostici bolesti su znacajni procjena tjelesnog i emocionalnog stanja i neuroloski pregled, dok CT i MR mogu iskljuciti postojanje neke druge bolesti ciji su simptomi vrlo slicni. Za dijagnosticiranje su potrebna dva od tri znaka bolesti (bradikinezija, rigor i tremor). Lijecenje se provodi lijekovima (MAO inhibitori, levodopa), kirurskim lijecenjem (duboka stimulacija mozga), te neurorehabilitacijom. Zbog prirode Parkinsonove bolesti najveci izazov predstavlja održanje kvalitete života bolesnika. Kvalitetu života posebice narusavaju ovisnost bolesnika, depresija, halucinacije, poteskoce s gutanjem i govorom, socijalna izolacija te motorni simptomi. Kvaliteta života se može procijeniti brojnim skalama i upitnicima. Najznacajnija skala je UPDRS skala kojom se procjenjuju invaliditet i komplikacije lijecenja. Skrb za oboljele mora ukljucivati radnu terapiju, logopedsku terapiju, rehabilitacijsku i fizikalnu terapiju te zdravstvenu njegu. Medicinska sestra procesom zdravstvene njege može prevenirati komplikacije (padove, malnutriciju, poteskoce s eliminacijom) i olaksati simptome bolesti poticanjem bolesnika na fizikalnu terapiju, te na taj nacin održati i/ili poboljsati kvalitetu života oboljelih. Palijativnom skrbi se želi poboljsati kvaliteta života olaksavanjem boli, simptoma i stresa i poticanjem neovisnosti.",

This is particularly true when depressive symptoms are experienced in the setting of coarse brain disease. Here the clinical presentation, differential diagnosis, and aetiology offer unique challenges to the clinician. The development of broader, more patient centred outcome measures such as quality of life and “health gain” has also elevated the status of depression, particularly because depressive symptoms are now seen to be the primary contributors to morbidity in some neurological illnesses. Two recent studies showed how depressive symptoms accounted for much more of the variance in morbidity in Parkinson’s disease (40%) than did movement disorder (17%).1,2 Critics of these studies could rightly point out that before the advent of L-dopa, motor disorder was definitely the biggest contributor to morbidity in Parkinson’s disease, and that quality of life as a measure is more directly related to mood state …",

The most common symptoms of the condition include slowness of movement, tremor and muscle stiffness; other symptoms include sleep difficulties, depression and anxiety. Parkinson's is usually controlled by medication but other treatments and therapies, such as occupational therapy, physiotherapy and speech and language therapy, can also be effective in controlling and managing symptoms. The timing of this medication is key to the successful management of Parkinson's. Delays to initiating medication or missed doses can have serious consequences, and it can take some time for symptoms to stabilize. Research into treatments for Parkinson's and, ultimately, finding a cure for the condition, is ongoing. Parkinson's UK researchers are working on projects to identify the causes of cell death and tests to detect the condition at its earliest possible stage. Current treatments can help to ease the symptoms but none can repair the damage in the brain or slow the progress of the condition; now, Parkinson's UK researchers are working to develop new treatments that can.",

      "abstract": "Non motor symptoms(NMS) in Parkinson’s Disease constitutes a\r\nmajor clinical challenge, as they are common, yet often overshadowed by\r\nthe dominance of motor symptoms and high awareness of these among\r\ntreating health care professionals. The NMS of PD were recognised by\r\nJames Parkinson himself. Thus in his essay on the shaking Palsy in 1817,\r\nhe referred to sleep disturbances, dysathria, constipation, dysphagia,\r\nsialorhoea, urinary incontinence, constant sleepiness with slight delirium.\r\nSince then numerous studies have indicated that NMS are frequent\r\naccompaniments of PD affecting memory, bladder and bowel and sleep\r\namong others. These NMS significantly affect the quality of life and may\r\nprecipitate hospitalization. Although common the NMS of PD are not\r\nwell recognised in clinical practice. While some such as depression,\r\ndementia, autonomic and sleep disturbances are well known, others such\r\nas dysphagia, dribbling of saliva, weight changes, sexual problems and\r\ndiplopia are less well recognised.\r\nThe NMS include neuropsychiatric symptoms, sleep disorders,\r\nautonomic symptoms, sensory symptoms and miscellaneous symptoms\r\nlike diplopia, fatigue and seborhea. The nonmotor symptoms\r\nquestionnaire (NMS Quest) and the nonmotor symprom scale (NMSS)\r\nwere developed to assess the frequency and severity of NMS in PD\r\npatients across all stages. The NMS Quest was validated in March 2007\r\nby the Movement Disorder Society. It covers 9 domains and includes 30\r\nitems, including sleep / fatigue, cardiovascular, mood/cognition,\r\nperceptual problems, attention / memory, gastrointestinal, urinary, sexual\r\nfunctions and miscellaneous. The NMS Quest does not provide an overall\r\nscore or disability and is not a graded rating instrument. It is a screening\r\ntool designed to draw attention to the presence of NMS and to initiate\r\nfurther investigation.\r\nNonmotor symptoms are prevalent across all stages of Parkinson’s Disease.\r\n(2) The most prevalent ones were Autonomic which includes Constipation, Nocturia, Urgency and sweating. This was followed by insomnia, depression and \r\nmemory disturbances. Dizziness,\r\nDrooling, Falls and unexplained pains were also significantly reported.\r\n(3) The number of NMS increased as the disease severity progressed. The number of NMS in stages 1 and 1.5 were the least. It increased\r\nthrough stages 2 and 2.5 and were highest reported in stages 3 and 4.\r\n(4) The number of NMS also correlated with the duration of the disease. The number of NMS were least when the duration was less\r\nthan 2 years, increasing as the duration increased and maximum reported when duration was more than 5 years.",

This is based on the chronologic sequence of the development of these problems, but the two conditions do not differ in any significant respect with regard to clinical features or pathology, and both may display phenotypic heterogeneity. Collectively they are known as the Lewy body dementias. As the main difference between them lies in the order of the temporal evolution of the dementia and the parkinsonism, this may determine to which specialist the condition first presents, and which are considered to be the dominant problems. Managing either condition is challenging because of the range of impairments which include not only cognitive failure, but also extrapyramidal features, a heavy neuropsychiatric burden, and autonomic dysfunction. Diagnostic criteria are now available for making the diagnosis of DLB or PDD. These should assist clinicians with more accurate diagnosis and also highlight the important clinical features that characterize these disorders.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a movement disorder identified more than 200 years ago; today it is defined by specific motor symptoms that together receive the name of parkinsonism. PD diagnosis is reached with the full parkinsonian syndrome, but in recent years, a series of non-motor symptoms have arisen as intrinsic components of PD. These non-motor symptoms are variable, creating a widely heterogenous disease presentation. Some non-motor symptoms appear in late disease stages and are explained as the natural progression of PD pathology into other brain centres, including the frontal cortex. Other symptoms can appear a decade or earlier preceding PD diagnosis, particularly hyposmia (loss of smell) and constipation. These early symptoms and the accompanying protein pathology have stimulated a lively conversation about the origin and nature of PD and other related conditions: some authors propose that PD starts in the olfactory mucosa and the gut due to direct exposure to toxins or pathogens. This pathology then travels by anatomically interconnected networks to the midbrain to cause motor symptoms and the cortex to cause late complications. Other models propose that PD develops in multiple independent foci that do not require pathology spread. We will review these hypotheses in the context of recent developments regarding the spread of amyloids and propose a mixed model where a multifocal origin explains the variable presentation of PD, while cell-to-cell spread explains stereotypical disease progression.",

Sleepwalking and sleep terrors have been defined as disorders of arousal that occur early in the night and have their onset during stage 3 or 4 sleep. In both disorders, patients are difficult to arouse, and complete amnesia or minimal recall of the episode is frequent. Genetic, developmental, and psychological factors have been identified as causes of both sleepwalking and sleep terrors. Sleepwalking and sleep terrors typically begin in childhood or early adolescence and are usually outgrown by the end of adolescence.? When sleepwalking or sleep terrors have a post-pubertal onset or continue to adulthood, psychopathology is a more significant causative factors. The behavior that occur from deep slow-wave sleep can be painful or dangerous to the individual and/or disturbing to those close to that individual. The assessment of patients suspected of having these conditions requires a thorough medical and sleep history. The most important consideration in managing patients with sleepwalking or sleep terrors episodes is protection from injury. Language: ko",

Primary and secondary insomnia, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RDB), central sleep apnea, restless legs, and nocturnal akinesia are common sleep disturbances in PD. Prodromal presence of RBD is associated with a more severe motor and non-motor PD subtype implying a significant disease-modifying effect of this parasomnia. Other disease-modifying mechanisms of sleep disturbances in PD include impaired glymphatic clearance, endoplasmic reticulum stress, nocturnal brain deoxygenation and inflammatory processes among others. Impairments of neural circuit switching and imbalance between inhibitory and excitatory neuronal populations are likely responsible for episodic sleep disturbances, in particular RBD. As neural circuits may predict patterns of α-synuclein propagation in the nervous system, impairments of such circuits are of high relevance for PD pathophysiology. Future research is needed to determine whether appropriate treatment for disturbed sleep might slow progression of PD.",

      "title": "Management of anxiety and motor symptoms in Parkinson’s disease",
      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is typically known for its cardinal motor symptoms, but a growing body of literature is recognizing a multitude of important nonmotor symptoms as well. Anxiety is one of the most common nonmotor symptoms of PD; unfortunately, neither the management of anxiety nor its influence on motor symptoms is well understood. While recent literature indicates a correlation between motor symptoms and anxiety in PD, it remains uncertain whether one symptom acts as the underlying cause of the other. This review considers the cyclic interaction between anxiety and motor symptoms in PD, each exacerbating the other when they coexist. It may be critically important to disentangle if one symptom serves as an underlying cause of the other, since this might dictate appropriate treatment. Neuroanatomical substrates as well as the treatments for both motor symptoms and anxiety are discussed in detail to consider the evidence-base for the management of PD.",

      "abstract": "Impulse control disorders are a psychiatric condition characterized by the failure to resist an impulsive act or behavior that may be harmful to self or others. In movement disorders, impulse control disorders are associated with dopaminergic treatment, notably dopamine agonists (DAs). Impulse control disorders have been studied extensively in Parkinson’s disease, but are also recognized in restless leg syndrome and atypical Parkinsonian syndromes. Epidemiological studies suggest younger age, male sex, greater novelty seeking, impulsivity, depression and premorbid impulse control disorders as the most consistent risk factors. Such patients may warrant special monitoring after starting treatment with a DA. Various individual screening tools are available for people without Parkinson’s disease. The Questionnaire for Impulsive-Compulsive Disorders in Parkinson’s Disease has been developed specifically for Parkinson’s disease. The best treatment for impulse control disorders is prevention. However, after the development of impulse control disorders, the mainstay intervention is to reduce or discontinue the offending anti-Parkinsonian medication. In refractory cases, other pharmacological interventions are available, including neuroleptics, antiepileptics, amantadine, antiandrogens, lithium and opioid antagonists. Unfortunately, their use is only supported by case reports, small case series or open-label clinical studies. Prospective, controlled studies are warranted. Ongoing investigations include naltrexone and nicotine.",

The different types of involuntary movements are closely related to the underlying muscle tone. Mechanisms of bradykinesia or akinesia have been elaborated in physiological studies on Parkinson's disease, and the significance of sensorimotor processing or attention, arousal has been disclosed as a relevant factor of bradykinesia. Cognitive functions of the basal ganglia have attracted attention, particularly in the disorder of Parkinson's disease. Subcortical dementia, difficulty in formation or changes of concepts, is encountered in advanced stages of Parkinson's disease. Whether cognitive functions in the frontostriatal system are primarily related to the motor function of the brain is an issue for future study.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is predominantly recognized for its motor symptoms, but patients struggle from a morbid and heterogeneous collection of non-motor symptoms (NMS-PD) that can affect their quality of life even more. NMS-PD is a rather generalized term and the heterogeneity and non-specific nature of many symptoms poses a clinical challenge when a PD patient presents with non-motor complaints that may not be NMS-PD.We report two patients with idiopathic PD who presented with acute episodes of cognitive changes. Structural brain images, cardiovascular and laboratory assessment were unremarkable. Both patients experienced a considerable delay before receiving an epilepsy-evaluation, at which point electroencephalogram abnormalities supported the diagnosis of focal non-motor seizures with alteration of awareness. Antiepileptic therapy was implemented and was effective in both cases.Diagnosing non-motor seizures can be challenging. However, PD patients pose an even greater challenge given their eclectic non-motor clinical manifestations and other disease-related complications that could confound and mislead adequate clinical interpretation. Our two cases provide examples of non-motor seizures that may mimic non-motor symptoms of PD. Treating physicians should always consider other possible causes of non-motor symptoms that may coexist in PD patients. Epilepsy work-up should be contemplated in the differential of acute changes in cognition, behavior, or alertness.",

In fact, Parkinson's disease is characterized not only by unilateral motor symptoms that arise at the early stages, but has other non-motor symptoms such as autonomic or cognitive alterations that are also revealed asymmetrically.Brain asymmetry has been underestimated when analyzing the pathogeny of brain diseases and it has been partially studied only in some specific cases, such as Parkinson's disease. However, in order to appropriately understand some brain diseases such as Parkinson's disease, the need to consider this phenomenon has been highlighted.Asimetria cerebral y dopamina: mas alla de las implicaciones motoras en la enfermedad de Parkinson y hemiparkinsonismo experimental.Introduccion. La asimetria cerebral se puede definir como la existencia de diferencias funcionales, anatomicas o neuroquimicas entre los dos hemisferios cerebrales. Se trata de un fenomeno dinamico modulable por factores endogenos y exogenos. Su significado funcional esta apenas aclarado y solo lo esta en algunos casos muy concretos como, por ejemplo, la relacion existente entre el contenido cerebral lateralizado de dopamina y sus efectos motores, que se manifiesta especialmente en la enfermedad de Parkinson. Desarrollo. El contenido asimetrico cerebral de dopamina no solo da lugar a efectos motores lateralizados, sino que se extiende a consecuencias autonomicas y de conducta igualmente lateralizadas. De hecho, la enfermedad de Parkinson se caracteriza por sintomas motores unilaterales, que surgen en las fases iniciales de la enfermedad, y por otros sintomas no motores, como alteraciones autonomicas o cognitivas, que tambien se manifiestan de forma lateralizada. Conclusiones. La asimetria cerebral ha sido un aspecto infravalorado a la hora de analizar la patogenia de las enfermedades cerebrales, y solo en determinados casos, como en la enfermedad de Parkinson, se ha profundizado parcialmente en su estudio. Sin embargo, se ha puesto en evidencia que es necesario considerar este fenomeno para la adecuada comprension de algunas patologias cerebrales, como es el caso de la enfermedad de Parkinson.",

      "abstract": "Parkinsonism plus syndrome is a group of heterogeneous degenerative neurological disorders, which differ from the classical idiopathic Parkinson's disease in certain associated clinical features, poor response to levodopa, distinctive pathological characteristics and poor prognosis. Associated clinical features include symmetrical onset, infrequent or atypical tremor, prominent rigidity in axial musculature, bradykinesia, early postural instability, supranuclear gaze palsy, early autonomic failure, pyramidal affection, cerebellar involvement, alien limb phenomenon, apraxia and significant early cognitive dysfunction in some cases. Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), multiple system atrophy (MSA) and dementia with Lewy body disease (DLB) are commoner disorders. Less frequent disorders are cortico-basal ganglionic degeneration (CBGD), frontotemporal dementia with chromosome 17 (FTDP-17), Pick's disease, parkinsonian-dementia complex of Guam, Pallidonigral degeneration, Wilson's disease and a rigid variant of Huntington's disease. During the last 3 decades, major progress has been made in understanding PSP, CBGD and FTDP-17, which are tau disorders. MSA and DLB together with idiopathic Parkinson's disease are called alpha-synucleinopathies. Recent studies show that the diagnosis of these Parkinsonism plus syndromes improves when strict diagnostic criteria are used. However, unusual presentations may pose a diagnostic challenge. The shortcomings of the current studies demand the need for further research to identify biologic markers that may allow earlier diagnosis, and understanding of the factors leading to alpha-synuclein or tau aggregation. Identification of therapeutic strategies that may prevent the aggregation of these proteins and rescue dysfunctional cells has been stressed. This review focuses on the advances in the clinical, neuroimaging, pathologic, genetic and management aspects of these disorders.",

She had minor improvement in ambulation with levodopa treatment, and she significantly improved in ambulation only during her manic states. Examination of the subject's post-mortem brain revealed no explicit evidence of degeneration in substantia nigra or other brainstem centers, and no nigral or cortical Lewy bodies were present. Glial cytoplasmic inclusions (characteristic of multiple systems atrophy) and globose neurofibrillary tangles (seen in progressive supranuclear palsy) were not seen either. This patient's presentation was most consistent with neuroleptic-induced parkinsonism and tardive dyskinesia; the etiology was likely related to previous neuroleptic exposure.",

A DP e uma afeccao do sistema nervoso central que se expressa de forma cronica e progressiva. Ela tem etiologia idiopatica, sendo a associacao de fatores geneticos e ambientais, sendo que estes podem ser moldados, para reduzir progressao e incidencia, os fatores relacionados. A DP tem como fisiologia o envolvimento e degeneracao de neuronios localizados na via dopaminergica nigroestriatal. Apresenta-se, clinicamente, com sintomatologia motora e nao motora. Esta e exemplificada por disturbios do sono, incontinencia urinaria e depressao, que pode ate gerar prejuizos da memoria episodica, com o seu avancar; ja aqueles sao ilustrados por bradicinesia, tremores em repouso e instabilidade postural. Objetivo: Comparar o prejuizo da memoria episodica e cognitivo em pacientes DP com e sem depressao. Metodo: Tratou-se de um estudo transversal, realizado no ambulatorio de movimento no Hospital Universitario Alberto Antunes ( HUPAA) de Maceio-AL. Participaram deste estudo 46 pacientes, de ambos os sexos, com idade igual ou superior a 60 anos. Os instrumentos utilizados para a pesquisa foram, questionario sociodemografico estruturado desenvolvido pelos pesquisadores para caracterizacao dos pacientes (idade, sexo, etnia, escolaridade e outros), a Escala de Depressao Geriatrica, versao reduzida (GDS-15), o Teste de Aprendizagem Auditivo Verbal de Rey (RAVLT) e a Avaliacao Cognitiva Montreal (MoCA). Resultados: Os participantes da pesquisa tinham idade compreendida entre 34-78 anos (X = 60,39; DP= 8,77). Houve prevalencia do sexo masculino, com 65,2% dos entrevistados e maior predilecao para a baixa escolaridade, (X =6,45; DP= 5,02). De acordo com a GDS, 63% dos pacientes tiveram rastreio para Depressao positiva, sendo que 50% destes apresentaram depressao em nivel leve e 15,25% com depressao em nivel grave. Sobre a relacao da depressao e o prejuizo da memoria episodica medido pelo teste RAVLT, apresentou-se um resultado estatisticamente significativo (p=0,043) e (p=0,042) no MoCA. Ja em relacao ao declinio cognitivo, houve diferenca significava entre os grupos no escore total da MoCA (p=0,042). Diante dos dominios que compoem esse mesmo instrumento, obteve-se relacao estatisticamente significativa nos dominios funcao executiva (p=0,016) e abstracao (p=0,031). Conclusao: De acordo com os dados supracitados, identifica-se maior incidencia de DP em pacientes do sexo masculino e com baixa escolaridade. Sobre a depressao nestes, ha uma relacao direta com prejuizos cognitivos, nos dominios de funcoes executiva e de abstracao.",

The children with cerebral palsy can also have some others damages such as vision, learning, sense or speech damages, intellectual damage, epilepsy, feeding disorders and so on. Cerebral palsy can be divided into four types: spastic, choreoatetotic, ataxic and mixed type. All limbs can be affected, that is, both arms and legs (quadriplegic), or mostly just the legs (diplexia), or just a hand and a leg on one side of the body (hemiplegia). It can not be surely determinate which are the causes of cerebral palsy. The causes are not the complications during child birth, but different prenatal factors and indications, which are divided as prenatal, perinatal and postnatal. Also, there are mostly several causes, and not only one that leeds to the formation of cerebral palsy. Cerebral palsy symptoms can be detected already in early childhood. When detected, the doctors pediatricians and physiatrists will set the diagnosis and determine the necessary exercises. Very important factors for successful integration and active participation of people with cerebral palsy are family support and timely treatments. If needed, a child with cerebral palsy can have an assistant or a therapeutic dog. With a purpose to view more insight into the life and everyday activities of people with cerebral palsy, it has been done a research which has shown that most people with cerebral palsy dresses by themselves, do the hygiene by themselves, participate in housekeeping, but unfortunately most respondents are unemployed, have difficulties in living, and don't do the sports. The conclusions of the research pointed to the need for greats involvement of society in the implementation of activities aimed at improving the life of people with cerebral palsy.",

These changes may be intrinsic and part of the process of ageing (see Chapter 3) or they may be the result of pathological conditions in other organs and tissues, especially in the cardiovascular system. Critchley (1931) has drawn attention to the effects of ageing on neurological signs. Many physical signs indicative of disease in the young may not be of significance in the diagnosis of clinical neurological disorders in old age. Thus loss of vibration sense and tendon jerks in the lower limbs do not necessarily mean peripheral neuropathy; irregular sluggish pupils are not pathognomonic of neurosyphilis and the frequent occurrence of a bodily attitude of flexion, disorders of gait, tremors and a positive glabellar tap sign leads to difficulties in establishing the diagnosis of Parkinsonism.",

      "abstract": "Renal failure is relatively common, but except in association with spina bifida or paraplegia it is unlikely to occur as a result of disease of the CNS. Renal failure, however, commonly affects the nervous system. The effects of kidney failure on the nervous system are more pronounced when failure is acute. In addition to the important problems related to renal failure there are both acquired and genetically determined diseases which may affect the kidney and the brain. Those acquired diseases include the vasculitides, the paraproteinaemias, and various granulomatous conditions (considered in other chapters of <i>Neurology and Medicine</i>). In two of the most commonly encountered genetically determined diseases, Von Hippel-Lindau disease and polycystic kidney disease, location of pathogenic mutations will provide improved screening programmes and, possibly, allow therapeutic intervention. Uraemia may affect both the central and peripheral nervous systems. Whereas the clinical features of uraemia are well documented, the pathophysiology is less well understood and probably multifactorial. Uraemic encephalopathy, which classically fluctuates, is associated with problems in cognition and memory and may progress to delirium, convulsions, and coma. The encephalopathy may initially worsen with periods of dialysis and almost certainly relates to altered metabolic states in association with ionic changes and possibly impaired synaptic function. Renal failure may affect the peripheral nervous system, resulting in a neuropathy which shows a predilection for large diameter axons. This may be reversed by dialysis and transplantation. The myopathy seen in renal failure, often associated with bone pain and tenderness, is similar to that encountered in primary hyperparathyroidism and osteomalacia. Dialysis itself is associated with neurological syndromes including the dysequilibrium syndrome, subdural haematoma, and Wernicke's encephalopathy. Dialysis dementia, which was prevalent during the 1970s, has reduced in frequency with the use of aluminium free dialysate. With the introduction of transplantation and the concomitant use of powerful immunosuppressive drugs, the pattern of neurological problems encountered in renal replacement therapy has shifted. Five per cent of patients develop nerve injuries during renal transplantation, and up to 40% of patients experience neurological side effects from cyclosporine. Furthermore, CNS infections, often fungal in type, have been reported in up to 45% of transplant patients coming to postmortem. The nature of the involvement of neurologists with their nephrology colleagues is therefore evolving.",

      "title": "Valor diagnóstico combinado de la evaluación olfatoria y el estudio ecográfico transcraneal en el diagnóstico diferencial de los pacientes con enfermedades de parkinson y otros trastornos del movimiento",
      "abstract": "Antecedentes y objetivos: La enfermedad de Parkinson es una de las enfermedades neurodegenerativas mas comunes. Su diagnostico diferencial, especialmente en las fases precoces, supone un reto para el clinico puesto que muchas de sus manifestaciones motoras pueden ser compartidas por otras enfermedades como el temblor esencial, la atrofia multisistema, la paralisis supranuclear progresiva y el parkinsonismo vascular o el inducido por farmacos entre otros. La neuroimagen funcional mediante PET o SPECT nos ayuda en este proceso diagnostico, pero su uso esta limitado debido a su elevado coste, baja accesibilidad e inconvenientes derivados de los radiotrazadores empleados. Existe por tanto un creciente interes en el desarrollo de marcadores biologicos que ayuden en el diagnostico de la enfermedad de Parkinson.\nActualmente, la enfermedad de Parkinson se reconoce como una enfermedad del espectro de la ?-sinucleina y taupatias, que se acompana de una gran cantidad de sintomas no motores como alteracion del olfato, vista, gusto, sueno, funcion cardiovascular, gastrica e intestinal, salivacion, actividad de las glandulas sebaceas, estado animico y cognicion. Muchos de estos sintomas no motores, al igual que la presencia de hiperecogenicidad de la sustancia negra en la ecografia transcraneal, preceden en un periodo variable de anos a los sintomas motores cardinales y han sido descritos en multiples estudios asociados a la enfermedad de Parkinson, o al riesgo de padecerla.\nDentro de estos marcadores, la disfuncion olfatoria y la hiperecogenicidad de la sustancia negra en la ecografia transcraneal tienen la ventaja de poder ser evaluados de forma sencilla, inocua y con bajo coste economico por el mismo neurologo. Diferentes grupos de trabajo han descrito la utilidad individual de cada uno de estos marcadores en el diagnostico de la enfermedad de Parkinson y su diferenciacion con otras enfermedades, pero muy poco se conoce sobre el valor diagnostico de la aplicacion conjunta de ambos y su utilidad como marcadores de riesgo de diagnostico de enfermedad de Parkinson en pacientes con sintomas parkinsonianos leves o temblor de causa no filiada.\nMetodos.\nSe trata de un estudio en dos fases, transversal observacional y prospectivo, realizado en las consultas externas del servicio de Neurologia del hospital IMED Levante, Alicante. En una primera fase se seleccionaron a pacientes con diagnostico de enfermedad de Parkinson, temblor esencial, parkinsonismo vascular y parkinsonismo inducido por farmacos segun los criterios diagnosticos vigentes. En todos ellos se realizo una ecografia transcraneal para la evaluacion de la sustancia negra y se realizo una evaluacion olfatoria mediante el test SS-12. Se analizo el valor diagnostico de cada marcador de forma independiente y en conjunto para la discriminacion de los pacientes con enfermedad de Parkinson del resto. En una segunda etapa, se siguio longitudinalmente una cohorte de pacientes con temblor o parkinsonismo de causa no filiada a los que basalmente se evaluaron ambos marcadores. Se analizo la capacidad predictiva de cada marcador, y de su combinacion, para identificar a los pacientes que en el seguimiento clinico serian diagnosticados de enfermedad de Parkinson.\nResultados.\n Se seleccionaron un total de 53 pacientes con enfermedad de Parkinson, 51 controles y 79 pacientes en el grupo de pacientes con temblor esencial, parkinsonismo vascular o parkinsonismo inducido por farmacos (grupo NO EP). Frente al grupo control, la presencia de hiperecogenicidad de sustancia negra identificaba a los pacientes con enfermedad de Parkinson con una sensibilidad, especificidad y valor predictivo positivo del 81%, 90% y 85% respectivamente. Por su parte la hiposmia tenia unos valores de 67%, 84% y 75% respectivamente. El analisis conjunto de ambos marcadores aumentaba los valores de especificidad al 98% y de valor predictivo positivo al 94%. Por otro lado, en la discriminacion de los pacientes con enfermedad de Parkinson frente al grupo NO EP, la hiperecogenicidad de la sustancia negra obtuvo unos valores de sensibilidad, especificidad y valor predictivo positivo del 81%, 88% y 85% respectivamente. En el caso de la hiposmia estos valores fueron del 67%, 66% y 64% respectivamente. Ambos marcadores conjuntamente obtenian una especificidad del 92% y un valor predictivo positivo del 85%.\n De los 65 pacientes incluidos en el seguimiento prospectivo, un total de 21 fueron diagnosticados de enfermedad de Parkinson tras un periodo de seguimiento medio de 354 dias. La hiperecogenicidad de la sustancia negra identifico a estos pacientes con una sensibilidad, especificidad y valor predictivo positivo del 52%, 81% y 61% respectivamente. La hiposmia lo hizo con unos valores del 71%, 78% y 65% respectivamente. La deteccion conjunta de ambos marcadores aumento los valores de especificidad y valor predictivo positivo al 97% y 87% respectivamente.\nConclusiones.\nLa presencia combinada de hiperecogenicidad de sustancia negra y alteracion olfatoria es una herramienta diagnostica de elevada especificidad para el diagnostico de la enfermedad de Parkinson frente a otras causas de alteraciones del movimiento como temblor esencial, parkinsonismo vascular y parkinsonismo inducido por farmacos. Igualmente, identifica precozmente y con elevada especificidad, en una cohorte de pacientes con sintomas parkinsonianos leves o temblor sin causa conocida, a aquellos pacientes con riesgo de ser diagnosticados de enfermedad de Parkinson durante el seguimiento.\nAmbos marcadores son accesibles a nivel ambulatorio, rapidos, de bajo coste, e inocuos para el paciente, lo que los convierten en buenos candidatos para ser aplicados en las primeras lineas del proceso diagnostico en nuestros pacientes con parkinsonismo.",

Four classical symptoms, including bradykinesia, tremor, rigidity, and postural abnormalities, are used to establish a clinical diagnosis of PD. However, this research is aimed at exploring the range of non-motor symptoms with an emphasis upon their ability to affect the patients with PD and their quality of life. With a slow onset of the known symptoms like tremor or rhythmic shaking of limbs called “pill-rolling tremor”, slowed movement (bradykinesia), muscle rigidity, stooped and altered posture, loss of the ability to blink or smile, and various speech and writing changes; the disease takes a leap into the non-motor symptoms like dementia, drooling, swallowing issues, difficulty urinating, and constipation. The dopaminergic pathophysiology of PD explains the anxiety, slowness of thought, fatigue, and dysphoria. Knowing the non-motor symptoms is crucial to help the clinician to make early diagnosis and to better understand the prognosis of the spectrum of this disease.",

      "abstract": "Atypical parkinsonism is another form of parkinsonism, which is having a more widespread pathology than seen in Parkinson’s disease. A group of neurodegenerative conditions including Multiple system atrophy (MSA), Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), and Corticobasal syndrome (CBS) constitute this form of parkinsonism. Due to the widespread pathology including degeneration of striatum, globus pallidus, cerebellum, and brainstem, as well as the SNc, the clinical features tend to resemble to that of Parkinson’s disease, but different manifestations are seen. Early involvement of speech and gait, absence of rest tremor, lack of motor asymmetry are the clinical presentations seen in patients with atypical parkinsonism. Additionally, poor or no response to levodopa, and a more aggressive clinical course also differs it from Parkinson’s disease. Initially, the diagnosis is difficult, but as the disease progress, a clear diagnosis can be obtained. A 64-year-old male patient was admitted to Kayachikitsa IPD complaining of difficulty in walking, slowness of activities, whole body numbness, tremor of hands and chronic constipation. On examination, extrapyramidal signs were positive, sensory system was not much affected, hyperreflexia and decreased muscle bulk was noted. Unified MSA rating scale was used to assess the change in quality of life before and after treatment. Vatavyadhi and Gulma Chikitsa was adopted. Procedures such as Churnapinda Sweda, Sirodhara, Vasti, Nasya were done. Walking and tremor of hands improved significantly. Mild decrease in whole body numbness, overall increase in body strength were obtained.",

      "title": "CHRONIC SLEEP FRAGMENTATION ACCELERATES THE DEVELOPMENT OF PRODROMAL SYMPTOMS AND PATHOLOGICAL CHANGES IN PARKINSON’ S DISEASE MODEL MICE",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Parkinson’ s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer’ s disease. Patients with PD exhibit various non-motor symptoms, including constipation, hyposmia, and sleep disturbance, in addition to classical motor symptoms such as bradykinesia, muscular rigidity, and rest tremor. The pathological hallmarks of PD are phosphorylated alpha-synuclein (p-syn) accumulation and dopaminergic neuronal loss in substantia nigra pars compacta. Patients are generally diagnosed with PD after the onset of motor symptoms, but the onset of non-motor symptoms often precedes that of motor symptoms. This prodromal phase of PD, which lasts for more than a decade, is a critical time window for disease modification to prevent or delay the onset of motor symptoms. Insomnia is the most common sleep disorder in older adults and patients with PD. In patients with PD, chronic sleep fragmentation due to frequent nocturnal arousals is the most prevalent symptom of insomnia. While various PD-related etiologies induce chronic sleep fragmentation, recent epidemiological studies suggested that chronic sleep fragmentation itself may accelerate the clinical and pathological progression of PD. However, the precise causal relationship between progression of PD and chronic sleep fragmentation remains unknown. Aims &amp; Objectives We aimed to test whether chronic sleep fragmentation accelerates the disease course of PD using model mice. Method Transgenic mouse model of PD (Tg) that recapitulates age-dependent onset and progression of premotor non-motor symptoms, or wild type (WT) mice were housed in either of the following cages from the age when Tg mice do not exhibit non-motor symptoms: (1) sleep disturbance (SD) cage, a running- wheel-based device that induces chronic sleep fragmentation similar to PD patients (SD group), (2) wheel cage (WC), a control cage with a running wheel but with no sleep disruption (WC group), or (3) normal cage (NC), another control cage without running wheel (NC group). After 5 or 6 weeks, multiple non- motor symptoms were evaluated. After 7 weeks, brains were collected, and p-syn accumulation in the brains of Tg mice was evaluated. Results Among Tg mice, only the SD group showed non-motor symptoms. Among WT mice, the SD group showed no or minimal non-motor symptoms which were milder than that of Tg mice in the SD group. Among Tg mice, the SD group showed significantly increased p-syn accumulation in multiple brain regions. Discussion &amp; Conclusion These results suggest that chronic sleep fragmentation accelerates the onset of prodromal symptoms and p-syn accumulation in PD model mice. Our findings implicate that chronic sleep fragmentation would be a potential target for preventing or delaying the motor onset of PD.",

      "abstract": "After Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease is the most prevalent neurodegenerative condition. Parkinson's disease normally appears between the ages of 55 and 65, affects 1 to 2 percent of persons over 60, and progresses to 3 to 5 percent of people between the ages of 85 and 89. The olfactory bulbs and nucleus as well as the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve are first affected, followed by the locus coeruleus and finally the substantia nigra. Later on, the brain's cortical regions are impacted. The multifaceted pathophysiologic changes that result in impairments not only of the motor system but also of the cognitive and neuropsychological systems are caused by damage to these numerous neural systems. Although there is no known cure for Parkinson's disease, drugs can frequently significantly reduce the symptoms. Since they may be taken for a long period without having serious side effects and contain antioxidant characteristics, herbal drugs do well in this category. Surgery may be indicated in select cases with more severe conditions.",

In this condition, the clinical features of Parkinson’s disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) converge. Both PD and DLB populations have different sleep disturbances that are amplified when combined. Hence, sleep disruption is often significant and multifactorial in PDD. It is proposed that sleep–wake neural networks are affected early in the neurodegenerative process. The resultant lack of sleep results in impaired clearance of toxic metabolites, hastening disease progress. As the motor and nonmotor symptoms of PDD worsen, sleep becomes more disturbed. Medications used to control these symptoms can be sedating or cause insomnia. Comorbid sleep disorders are also often present. All of these factors contribute to poor sleep in these patients. Management is centered on symptom control, quality of life, and treatment of comorbidities.",

      "title": "[Causes, diagnosis and treatment of neurogenic dysphagia as an interdisciplinary clinical problem].",
      "abstract": "The intricate mechanism of swallowing can be divided into three phases: oral, pharyngeal, and esophageal. Dysphagia is a disruption in the swallowing process, which include difficulty in transporting (or a lack of transporting) a food or liquid bolus from the mouth through the pharynx and esophagus into the stomach. Causes of disruptions in the swallowing process can be divided into superior (oropharyngeal) and inferior (esophageal) according to Paradowski et al. Neurlologic dysphagia may be caused by a disruption in different parts of the central nervous system (supranuclear level, level of motor and sensory nuclei taking part in swallowing process, peripherial nerves level and a pathology of muscle cells and spindles) or neuromuscular and muscular disorders. Neuromuscular disorders causes according to Waśko-Czopnik et al. are: stroke, brain tumors, brain injury, bulbar and pseudobulbar paralysis, neurodegenerative diseases (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis), tabes dorsalis, multisystem degenerations, Parkinson's disease, delayed dyskineses, Huntington's disease, myasthenia and myasthenic syndromes, myopathies and peripherial neuropathies. The correct diagnosis evaluation include history taking, physical examination with palpation and consultations (laryngological, gastrological and neurological). According to Halama radiological esophagogram, videofluoroscopy, flexible endoscopic examination, ultrasound examination, manometry, electromyography, scintigraphy and 24 hour pH monitoring are main diagnostic procedures of dysphagia. Some of the reasons for the neurologic dysphagia may be treated by surgical and pharmacological methods. Neurologic dysphagia rehabilitation is difficult, long-lasting and often falling far short of expected results. Primary it should include neurologic cause treatment if it is possible. According to WHO International Classification of Functioning and Health in 2001 non-invasive methods of dysphagia treatment may be divided into reconstitution, compensatory and adaptive techniques. The most popular reconstitution methods are thermal stimulation (Lazzar's) or tactilethermal application (Rosenbeck's) techniques which may be applied for abnormal duration of stage transition (DST). Abnormal duration of stage transition considerably increase probability of aspiration. Dysphagia treatment by compensatory methods consist in various techniques of swallowing and posture changes application. Adaptive techniques include dietary changes--avoiding of sustenances strengthening dysphagia and adequate dietary intake. The basic principle of dysphagia rehabilitation is that the most effective way to regain efficiency is the regeneration on remains of lost function. Carrying out imperfect swallowing acts is probably the best way of increasing effectiveness and efficiency of swallowing. On the other hand imperfect swallowing acts may be hazardous because of the danger of aspiration and inhalation pneumonia.",

Acute psychosis is primary if it is symptomatic of a psychiatric disorder, or secondary if caused by a specific medical condition. Patients with primary psychiatric disorders are likely to have auditory hallucinations, prominent cognitive disorders, and complicated delusions. If psychosis is caused by a medical condition, the patient may exhibit cognitive changes and abnormal vital signs, and may have visual hallucinations. Illicit drug use is the most common medical cause of acute psychosis. Clinicians should ask about recent head injury or trauma, seizures, cerebrovascular disease, or new or worsening headaches. A subacute onset of psychosis should raise suspicion for an oncologic cause. Collateral history from family members is helpful in establishing the presentation and course of the illness. The physical examination should include complete neurologic and mental status assessments. Tachycardia or severe hypertension may indicate drug toxicity or thyrotoxicosis; fever may suggest encephalitis or porphyria. Suggested initial laboratory tests include a complete blood count, metabolic profile, thyroid function tests, urine toxicology, and measurement of parathyroid hormone, calcium, vitamin B12, folate, and niacin. Testing for human immunodeficiency virus infection and syphilis should also be considered. Prompt recognition of the etiology of psychosis may improve treatment, consultation, and prognosis.",

      "title": "Produljenje vozačke dozvole vozačima starijim od 65 godina",
      "abstract": "Zdravlje i sposobnost su relativni pojmovi u starosti. Stariji covjek može se smatrati toliko zdravim koliko za svoju svakodnevnicu ima dovoljno snage da se suprotstavi pojavama koje donosi starost, nedacama i svakodnevnim situacijama. Tjelesna istrosenost je relativna i ne ide usporedno sa smanjivanjem dusevnih snaga, a dusevne snage se trebaju pobuditi onda kad je potrebno svladati pojave koje donosi starenje, posebno negativan utjecaj bolesti i vanjskih faktora.\nZdravstveno stanje nije samo posljedica starosne dobi, ali svakako se starenjem povecava mogucnost da se ono narusi i sve brže mijenja. Najcesca stanja koja pogađaju stariju dobnu skupinu su povezana sa srcem i krvožilnim sustavom: hipertenzija i ateroskleroza, u gorim slucajevima infarkt; zatim, veliki je problem dijabetes, promjene u lokomotornom sustavu i sklonost padovima i frakturama. Nerijetko se događa da se uslijed nekih promjena na mozgu pojavi demencija ili druga stanja neuroloske ili psihijatrijske prirode.\nZbog svih navedenih razloga, te pomanjkanja mobilnosti i refleksa, smatra se da stariji vozaci predstavljaju određeni rizik u prometu. Nužan uvjet za ocuvanje sigurnosti na prometnicama su zdravstveni pregledi koji ce prevenirati da zdravstveno i psiholoski nesposoban vozac i dalje upravlja motornim vozilom i dovodi ostale sudionike u prometu u opasnost.\nKako bi utvrdili utjece li promjena zdravstvenog stanja uslijed starenja na vozacke sposobnosti, nasumicno je odabrano 25 ispitanika, vozaca starijih od 65 godina, to jest obrađeni su podaci iz medicinske dokumentacije nakon obavljenog zdravstvenog pregleda kod specijalista medicine rada u Domu zdravlja PGŽ. Rezultati pokazuju da su najcesca stanja i bolesti iz anamneze ispitanika hipertenzija (20%), bolesti krvožilja (14%,) i dijabetes (8%), a cak vise od polovice ispitanika je pretrpjelo frakture ili bilo hospitalizirano. 88% ispitanika je proglaseno ograniceno sposobnima, jedan ispitanik je proglasen sposobnim, a dvoje su proglaseni nesposobnima. Najcesce su Uvjerenja izdana na rok važenja od 2 ili 5 godina Nisu svi istraživaci složni oko odgovora na pitanje jesu li stariji vozaci rizicni, ali statistike za Hrvatsku prema podacima MUP-a govore da stariji vozaci uzrokuju 2/3 nesreca u kojima sudjeluju. Ako uzmemo u obzir da svi stariji vozaci koji su registrirani da posjeduju vozacku dozvolu ne voze, te da voze na znatno kracim relacijama, ovaj postotak je poražavajuci.\nIpak, nakon vise promjena zakona koji regulira kriterije za zdravstveni pregled vozaca , sada je na snazi zakon prema kojem je zdravstveni pregled obavezan samo ako je to navedeno u Uvjerenju dobivenom prije osposobljavanja vozaca. U europskim zemljama zdravstveni pregled je obavezan za starije vozace (Spanjolska, Velika Britanija, Svedska, Norveska), a jedino u Njemackoj je odgovornost o zdravstvenoj sposobnosti povjerena odabranom lijecniku vozaca. (11) Moguce je da ce se taj zakon uskoro opet mijenjati i možda uskladiti s nekim od europskih zakona.",

      "abstract": "Described over a century ago, schizophrenia still presents personal, clinical and scientific challenges, and is increasingly considered a concept rather than a single disorder. It has become a paradigmatic psychiatric disorder while remaining something of an enigma. Defined by a syndrome of psychotic phenomena (positive phenomena such as delusions, hallucinations or disordered thought structure) and negative features resulting from motivation and emotional dysfunction, schizophrenia is defined by symptoms lasting at least 4 weeks and impairment for 6 months or more [1, 2]. Where the illness is short-lived, the clinical syndrome is defined as a schizophrenia-related diagnosis [1]. The clinical presentation usually encompasses features prominent in other psychiatric conditions such as cognitive dysfunction, motor abnormalities, obsessional phenomena or depression. These additional features not included in the definition of schizophrenia underscore its pervasive neural dysfunction; they influence management and often shape the clinical outcome. The seeds of schizophrenia may be sown in early life with aberrant childhood development in multiple domains [2], but the clinical syndrome typically presents in early adulthood (Figure 9.10.1); abnormal neural connectivity may underly these seemingly remote phenomena.",

      "abstract": "Excessive daytime sleepiness (DS) is a common symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD), which can occur at any stage of the disease and decrease the quality of life of patients. The relationship between excessive daytime sleepiness and Parkinson's disease is determined by neurodegenerative process in the brain structures. However, there are many other factors, which can contribute to this phenomenon.To assess the prevalence and causes of DS as well as its impact on the quality of life of patients.Seventy patients (mean age 65.0±8.4 years) with PD, stage I-III, including 48 patients with DS and 22 without DS, were examined. All patients underwent clinical/neurological and neuropsychological examinations using a set of scales and polysomnography, if necessary.Sleep disorders are the most frequent non-motor symptoms of PD. The prevalence of subjective DS is determined for the first time. The disassociation between subjective and objective DS is observed in 32,5% of patients. Clinical combinations of DS with other sleep disorders are described. Taking dopaminergic medication contributes significantly to the development of DS and affective disorders (anxiety, depression) play a role in subjective DS.Введение. Дневная сонливость (ДС) является характерным проявлением болезни Паркинсона (БП), которое может возникать на любой стадии заболевания и приводить к снижению качества жизни больных. Связь ДС и БП обусловлена в первую очередь нейродегенеративным процессом в соответствующих структурах головного мозга. Тем не менее существует ряд других факторов, способствующих развитию этой патологии. Цель исследования. Оценить частоту и причины ДС, а также ее влияние на качество жизни пациентов с БП. Материал и методы. Обследовали 70 больных (средний возраст 65,0±8,4 года) с I-III стадиями БП: 48 пациентов с ДС, 22 - без ДС. Всем больным было проведено клинико-неврологическое и нейропсихологическое обследование (с применением ряда шкал), по необходимости - полисомнография. Результаты и заключение. Нарушения сна являются наиболее частыми немоторными симптомами БП. Впервые была установлена высокая частота субъективной ДС - у 32,5% пациентов (диссоциация между субъективно ощущаемой и объективно регистрируемой ДС). Был описан ряд клинических вариантов сочетания ДС с другими нарушениями сна. Выявили, что немаловажную роль в развитии ДС играет лекарственный фактор (терапия дофаминергическими препаратами), а в развитии субъективной ДС - аффективные нарушения (тревога, депрессия).",

      "abstract": "Management of patients with cognitive impairment is one of the most relevant and important problems of neurology. It is especially important to identify cognitive impairment at the early (pre-dementia) stages, when appropriate medical measures are implemented, the progression of cognitive decline can be slowed down or stopped. Near-moderate cognitive decline (NMCD) at elderly and senile ages may be a predictor for the development of clinically significant cognitive impairment up to dementia. In most Western works, NMCD is associated with subjective cognitive decline, but it would be more legitimate to distinguish a form (a stage) of mild cognitive decline among NMCDs. It is assumed that NMCD is not necessarily a precursor to more severe cognitive impairment – the former can be a manifestation of age-related changes, emotional-affective disorders, and neurological and somatic diseases, although their presence substantially increases the risk of moderate and severe cognitive impairment. The review provides current ideas about the initial forms of cognitive decline, as well as neuroimaging data in these patients. It considers the influence of emotional-affective and cardiovascular factors on the development of cognitive deficit.",

      "abstract": "he classic features of the clinical picture in Parkinson's disease (PD) are the motor disorders: akinesia, rigidity, tremor and postural instability.However, non-motor symptoms (NMS) are frequently present.Therefore, patients with PD can present, besides the typical parkinsonian motor syndrome, a wide arrow of NMS, mainly neuropsychiatric manifestations (as depression and cognitive impairment), sleep disorders (as rapid eye movement behavior disorder), autonomic dysfunctions (as intestinal constipation, postural hypotension and miccional disorders) and others, as fatigue and pain.In their various combinations, NMS may eventually become the main complaints of patients with PD.NMS may be related to the neurodegenerative changes affecting several neural systems and/or caused by drugs employed in the treatment of PD.The mainly neural systems related to NMS are: non-motor frontostriatal circuits, serotoninergic nuclei of median raphe, noradrenergic nuclei (locus coeruleus and subcoeruleus), autonomic centers (hypothalamus and dorsal motor of vagus) and olfactory system.The clinical picture of PD has been compared with an iceberg.The visible part represents the motor symptoms, and the larger non-visible part represents the several NMS, often underecognized in clinical practice.The study of Cosentino et al. 1 published in this issue of Arquivos de Neuropsiquiatria was performed aiming to determine the prevalence of NMS in 300 PD outpatients seen at the Movement Disorders Unit of the Instituto Nacional de Ciencias Neurológicas in Lima, Peru.The patients completed the Spanish validated version of the Non-motor Symptoms Questionnaire (NMSQuest).This questionnaire was developed by Chaudhuri et al. 2 to address the need for a quantitative and validated instrument to measure NMS in PD.The NMSQuest is a simple self-completed tool and it is comprised of 30 items grouped according to 9 NMS domains.The results of this study show the high prevalence and the variety of NMS in PD: at least one NMS was present in 99.3% of the patients evaluated and the mean total NMS (NMSQ-T) was 12.41 ranging from 0 to 27 of a maximum of 30.These data confirm those from previous similar studies.performed a multicentric, international, cross-sectional study involving 545 PD patients (mean disease duration: 6.96 year) using the same questionnaire (NMSQuest) and reported 10.3 as the mean total NMS, and such symptoms were present in 98.4% of the patients evaluated.The PRIAMO study (Barone et al. 4 ) is another important one to be compared to the Cosentino et al. 1 study.This Italian multicenter survey using a semi-structured interview in 1,072 consecutive patients with PD was performed to assess the prevalence NMS in 12 domains, their association with cognitive impairment and the impact on patients' quality of life.They found that 98.6% of patients with PD reported the presence of NMS and the mean number of NMS per patient was 7.8 ranging from 0 to 32.The NMS in PD may be present in all the clinical phases of the disease: pre-motor phase, the initial phase (when the motor symptoms appear and the diagnosis is made), the moderate phase and in the advanced phase.In the pre-motor phase, the most common NMS symptoms are: hyposmia, depression, intestinal constipation and rapid eye movement behavior disorder.Along the initial and moderate phases, several autonomic and neuropsychiatric manifestations may be present, and in the advanced one the most important NMS is dementia of PD.Consentino et al. 1 observed that the mean total NMS increased significantly with disease duration.Mean total NMS was 10.74 in patients with less than 5 years of disease, 13.71 between 5 and",

      "abstract": "La enfermedad de Parkinson (EP) es una patologia neurodegenerativa perteneciente al grupo de afecciones conocidas como trastornos del movimiento o parkinsonismo y para la que actualmente no existe cura. Los signos clinicos que manifiesta son resultado de una perdida neuronal superior al 60% en el area cerebral mas afectada, la sustancia nigra pars compacta. Asimismo, la aparicion de demencia y los desordenes cognitivos en la EP conducen a una EP con demencia. A su vez, la Demencia con cuerpos de Lewy (DCL) es tambien una enfermedad neurodegenerativa considerada como una de las causas mas comunes de demencia con una sintomatologia de deterioro cognitivo similar a la observable en la demencia de tipo Alzheimer y con la aparicion de sintomas de parkinsonismo. Su aparicion es insidiosa y se caracteriza por presentar una progresion lenta, a diferencia de su forma rapida tambien conocida como Demencia con cuerpos de Lewy rapidamente progresiva (DCLrp), que aparece de forma subita y evoluciona vertiginosamente. En todas estas enfermedades se produce una degeneracion neural que no es debida unicamente a la acumulacion de proteinas alteradas, sino mas probablemente como consecuencia de multiples factores deletereos convergentes. La hipotesis de este trabajo es considerar que la identificacion de cambios moleculares analizados gracias a la aplicacion de metodos “-omicos” servira para obtener informacion sobre un trascriptoma/proteoma de riesgo en las anteriormente citadas enfermedades. El principal objetivo abordado en la presente tesis es la identificacion de las alteraciones moleculares presentes en diferentes regiones cerebrales y en los distintos estadiajes de Braak de la EP, asi como en la DCL y en la DCLrp, por medio del uso de muestras de cerebro humano post-mortem comparando con controles, combinando estudios de microarrays, mRNA, proteinas y ensayos enzimaticos. Los resultados obtenidos por medio de metodos de transcriptomica con su posterior validacion y ampliacion a proteomica han permitido identificar alteraciones moleculares de distintas vias metabolicas incluyendo cambios en la maquinaria de sintesis de proteinas, en el metabolismo mitocondrial y energetico, en la neuroinflamacion, en la via de las purinas y en nuevas vias de senalizacion comprendiendo las vias olfativas y gustativas.",

Revisão bibliográfica: A DP é um distúrbio progressivo em que as células produtoras de dopamina localizadas na substância negra do cérebro degeneram. Esta afeta mais de 10 milhões de pessoas em todo o mundo, e espera-se que esse número dobre até 2030, dado o envelhecimento da população mundial. A doença é caracterizada por um conjunto central de anormalidades de movimento (motoras) como lentidão de movimentos, rigidez muscular e tremores, bem como uma série de características não motoras, como constipação, ansiedade e demência. Considerações finais: A DP é a segunda doença neurodegenerativa mais comum com sintomas motores e não motores que causa comprometimento na qualidade de vida do paciente. Seu diagnóstico é clínico com base na tríade bradicinesia ou lentidão de movimento associada a tremor de repouso e/ou rigidez. O tratamento farmacológico é feito através da reposição de dopamina, mas não fornece cura e nem retarda a progressão da doença, agindo apenas nos seus sintomas, sendo feito a base dos medicamentos Carbidopa/Levodopa.

      "title": "Depression",
      "abstract": "A diagnosis of DLB or PDD might make anyone depressed. It may also depress the spouse and family, although that is a topic for a later chapter. There are several reasons for depression in those with DLB or PDD. First, it may be a reaction to the diagnosis. Second, depression may also be a response to the limitations placed on life and activities. Third, it may reflect Lewy neurodegenerative damage within brain regions that mediate affect. Further complicating this issue is the fact that signs of parkinsonism give the appearance of depression (e.g., masked face). Moreover, symptoms that psychiatrists consider to be vegetative signs of depression, such as apathy, are also common primary symptoms of parkinsonian disorders. Depression is a quality-of-life issue that needs attention and appropriate treatment. Recognizing true depression is a crucial starting point and may be difficult in the context of DLB or PDD. Parkinsonian features often make someone appear depressed when clinically they are not. The following are primary symptoms and signs of parkinsonism that may be misinterpreted as evidence of depression: • Loss of facial animation (masking) • Slow to respond (bradykinesia) • Slowed thinking (bradyphrenia) • Apathy and loss of motivation • Poor appetite (sometimes) • Sleep disorder Moreover, declining engagement in sports, gardening, yard work, and other activities, may simply be due to the challenges of parkinsonism rather than to depression. Occasionally, people with DLB or PDD develop pseudobulbar affect, which is characterized by a markedly reduced threshold for crying (or laughing) in response to emotional stimuli. For example, mildly emotional stimuli easily provoke tears, such as a religious hymn or ritual. Similarly, scenes in a movie that might bring a tear to the eye of most people provoke uncontrollable crying. People with this condition report incongruity between what they are feeling and the emotional display. Pseudobulbar affect is important to recognize, as this is a component of the neurologic disorder and is not true depression. Although pseudobulbar affect is not true depression, it may respond to a low dose of certain antidepressants: tricyclics (e.g., nortriptyline, amitriptyline) or an SSRI (e.g., fluoxetine, sertraline); see the discussion below of antidepressant drugs.",

      "title": "Generalized Fatigue: Why Post-Polio Syndrome Should Be Included as A Differential Diagnosis",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor, Post-Polio Syndrome (PPS) is a neurological condition that manifests in the form of non-specific symptoms such as fatigue, sleep dysfunction, muscle and bone pains, at least 15 years after the initial infection with polio virus. Multiple mechanisms have been suggested to describe the pathogenesis of PPS, with some studies attributing it to accommodative changes in the muscle fibers, with replacement of type II fibers by type I fibers and muscle hypertrophy. It has also been postulated that the virus may persist unknowingly or be reactivated. Additionally, inflammatory and autoimmune causes have also been hypothesized.1 Among the symptoms, fatigue, muscle weakness with atrophy and motor dysfunction are the most common ones to be reported in PPS, associated with significant morbidity in patients. 2 Owing to the non availability of diagnostic tests for this condition, PPS remains a diagnosis of exclusion with factors such as a confirmation of previous polio infection and subsequent resolution characterized by neurologic stability for more than 15 years, abrupt onset of neurologic symptoms with persistence for one year, and exclusion of other possible attributable medical conditions established as essential parts of its diagnostic criteria. 3 The management of the condition is mainly based on physical therapy, and previous researches based on the use of drugs such as pyridostigmine, steroids, and IV immunoglobulins have shown limited efficacy in the improvement of the prognosis and condition of PPS patients.2 As of today, Pakistan remains among the three countries where the transmission of polio virus is prevalent, with the majority of outcomes in the past twenty years attributed to areas in the northern transmission zone bordering eastern Afghanistan, such as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Federally Administered Tribal Areas, and those in the southern transmission zone including southern Punjab, northern Sindh and Karachi.4 According to the Pakistan Polio Eradication Programme, 354 cases of polio virus have been reported in Pakistan from 2015-2024, with the highest number of infections occurring in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. This is in contrast to the 20,000 cases reported in the early 1990s prior to immunization efforts.5 Statistically, 15-20 million people across the globe still suffer from the sequelae of infection with the virus.1 Additionally, it has been postulated that about 25 to 40 percent of such survivors of poliomyelitis will experience PPS at some point in their lifetime. ---Continue",

Being able to correctly classify depression as bipolar rather than unipolar is crucial due to the ramifications of the diagnosis in terms of management. For example, it has been recommended that the depressive period of uncomplicated bipolar disorder should be treated for shorter periods than that for unipolar depression.1 Whereas in unipolar depression antidepressant monotherapy may be appropriate, in bipolar depression, without coupling it with a mood stabilizer, it may precipitate a “manic switch” and create a state of chronic irritable dysphoria and possibly a long-term rapid-cycling course.\r\n\r\nDue to symptomatic similarity between the 2 diagnostic entities, no particular symptom invariably distinguishes between the 2 disorders. However, if residents, psychiatrists, and family physicians can maintain a high index of suspicion, then certain factors from the past or present history would indicate that the depressive episode is more likely to be bipolar rather than unipolar. We describe the mnemonic “Bipolar Family” to remind clinicians of factors or symptom clusters that would make a depressive episode more likely to be bipolar rather than unipolar (Table 1).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTable 1.\r\n\r\n“Bipolar Family”: Factors That Make a Depressive Episode More Likely To Be Bipolar Rather Than Unipolara\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn view of the significant difference in treatment3 and despite the similarity in presentation, we hope that residents, psychiatrists, and primary care clinicians will utilize this mnemonic as a screening tool when faced with a patient who primarily presents with a depressive episode.",

      "abstract": "Various grades of cognitive impairment generally occur in older adults over the age of 55, where cardiovascular risk factors such as diabetes and/or hypertension, coronary artery disease, or cerebrovascular accidents are also common. Cognitive impairment occurs in various forms, from mild or amnesia such as forgetting today's date to more ominous and progressive forms, such as frank dementia. Over 5 million people worldwide suffer from dementia, most of whom live in low- and middle-income countries. It has been envisaged from the beginning that dementia or cognitive impairment has neurodegenerative origins. However, recent studies have indicated that dementia may have a mixed origin or may be preceded by vascular insult and then neurodegenerative pathology. From a pathophysiological standpoint, one of the puzzling questions in the field of cognitive impairment and comorbidities is that it is not clear whether cardiovascular comorbidity or cognitive impairment comes first. Cognitive impairment negatively affects mobility and fitness and this can potentially contribute to development of hypertension or/and diabetes. The present review examines this perplexing situation and tries to anser whether the comorbid conditions are innocent bystanders to cognitive impairment or they play greater causative roles. The rationale of the review is that it is possible to address these cardiovascular risk factors for dementia prevention and hence it summarizes the evidence related to cardiovascular risk factors and cognitive impairment.",

Certain chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease and hypertension are associated with mildly impaired cognitive functioning. Delerium may be mistaken for dementia in older people. Parkinson's disease occurs as a result of cell loss in the basal ganglia, an area in the underlying structure of the brain. A cerebrovascular accident or stroke occurs as a result of an infarction in the blood vessels to and within the brain, or a haemorrhage in the brain. Although head injuries affect larger numbers of younger people, falls and related head injuries are more common in older people. The onset of dementia is often accompanied by depression and anxiety.

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD), the most common motor movement disorder and second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer's disease (AD), is often preceded by a period of mild cognitive impairment (MCI), which is associated with impairment of a variety of cognitive domains including executive function, attention, visuospatial abilities and memory. MCI, a risk factor for developing dementia, affects around 30% of de novo PD patients and can increase to 75% after more than 10 years. While 30–40% remain in the MCI state, up to 60% will convert to dementia. Characteristic findings are slowing of EEG rhythms, frontotemporal hypoperfusion, decreased functional connectivity in the default mode and attentional networks, prefrontal and basal-ganglia-cortical circuits, which often manifests prior to clinical symptoms and overt brain atrophy. The heterogeneity of cognitive phenotypes suggests that a common neurodegenerative process affects multiple functional neuronal networks and neuromodulatory systems that may be superimposed by Lewy body and Alzheimer's-related or other co-pathologies. Sparse neuropathological data for PD-MCI revealed a heterogenous picture with various morphological changes similar to MCI in other diseases. This review highlights the essential epidemiological, clinical, neuroimaging and morphological changes in PD-MCI, available biomarkers, and discusses the heterogenous pathobiological mechanisms involved in its development. In view of its complex pathogenesis, well-designed longitudinal clinico-pathological studies are warranted to clarify the alterations leading to MCI in PD, which may be supported by fluid and neuroimaging biomarkers as a basis for early diagnosis and future adequate treatment modalities of this debilitating disorder.",

Some view depression as reactive to the physical disability inherent to Parkinson's disease; however, others view the depressive disorder as the direct result of underlying biochemical changes caused by the disease process. Abnormalities within the serotonin metabolic pathway have been observed in depressed patients with Parkinson's disease and may help to explain why this form of depressive disorder is so common and persistent. Other forms of depression share this biochemical alteration. Attempts to alleviate depression with serotonin agonists have proven successful. Current research efforts are exploring biological aspects of depression in Parkinson's disease and the epidemiology of this disorder as a model of depression in the elderly, medically ill patient.",

      "title": "[Cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease].",
      "abstract": "Cognitive impairment is a common finding in Parkinson's disease (PD), even in the early stages. The concept of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in PD was recently formalized with diagnosis being reached after impairments in neuropsychological tasks become significant in at least one domain. The brain profile of cognitive deficits involves executive functions (e. g., planning, set shifting, set maintenance, problem solving), attention and memory function. Memory deficits are characterized by impairments in delayed recall, temporal ordering and conditional associate learning. PD patients demonstrate relatively preserved recognition. Visuospatial dysfunctions have also been reported, while language is largely preserved. The existence of two distinct mild cognitive syndromes has also been suggested. One of these affects mainly the frontostriatal executive deficits that are modulated by dopaminergic medications and by a genetically determined level of prefrontal cortex dopamine release. The other affects the more-posterior cortical abilities, such as visuospatial and memory functions, and is suggested to be associated with an increased risk for conversion to dementia. Cross-sectional studies have commonly reported dementia in 20-30% of PD patients, although the 8-year cumulative incidence of dementia may be as high as 78%. Factors associated with dementia in PD are age at onset, age at the time of examination, akinetic-rigid form PD, depression, hallucination, rapid eye movement sleep behavioral disorder and severe olfactory deficits. Clinical features generally involve the same type of deficits as those found in MCI patients, which are more severe and more extensive. The phenomenology of the dementia syndrome is similar to that seen in dementia with Lewy bodies, and clinicopathological correlation studies have revealed varying results with regard to neurochemical deficits and the pathological substrate underlying cognitive impairment and dementia. Early cognitive impairment, particularly in the form of executive dysfunction, is indicative of mainly fronto-striatal pathologic changes and might originate during nigrostriatal and subsequent mesocortical dopamine denervation. A potential parallel noradrenergic deficit and cholinergic deficit disturbance in patients without dementia might also contribute to MCI. Extensive pathological changes in Lewy bodies lead to widespread cortical and subcortical degeneration and profound cholinergic deficits, and might lead to the development of dementia. Several studies have revealed a significant correlation between dementia and Alzheimer-type pathology.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Parkinson’s disease (PD) and atypical parkinsonian syndromes (APSs), defined mostly by motor features, are frequently complicated by concurrent psychiatric disorders. PD refers specifically to the progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by its three cardinal motor symptoms: rigidity, tremor, and bradykinesia, two of which are required for diagnosis. Parkinsonism, a less specific and nonetiologic term, is used when some of the following motor signs are present—rigidity, tremor, bradykinesia, and impaired postural reflexes. APSs are significantly less common than PD, and include other neurodegenerative disorders that present with parkinsonism, including multiple system atrophy (MSA), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), and vascular parkinsonism (VP). Except for vascular parkinsonism, APSs have historically been referred to as “Parkinson’s plus” syndromes in that the signs and symptoms include, but are not limited to, parkinsonism and can be difficult to distinguish from PD early in the disease course. Each of these conditions needs to be distinguished from medication-induced parkinsonism, a side-effect of multiple psychiatric and nonpsychiatric medications. This chapter provides an overview of Parkinson’s disease and atypical parkinsonian syndromes. It reviews the epidemiology, phenomenology, and treatment of motor, cognitive, and psychiatric features in each condition and includes a discussion of how such patients may present for psychiatric evaluation and guidelines on an approach to psychiatric assessment.",

      "title": "Alterations of the circadian timing system in rodent and non human primate models of Parkinson’s disease",
      "abstract": "Since the first description by James Parkinson in his essay on the shaking palsy, Parkinson’s disease (PD) was recognized as a motor disease identified by a tetrad of symptoms, namely; akinesia, muscular rigidity, resting tremor and postural instability. These symptoms are known to be related to loss of dopamine (DA) in the striatum following neural degeneration in the substantia nigra (SN). It is increasingly recognized that non-motor and perhaps non-dopaminergic related symptoms inevitably emerge and worsen during disease progression. Sleep disruption is one of the major non-motor symptoms and has been suggested as a preclinical marker of the disease. Models of sleep regulation have emphasized two distinct processes: a sleep-control mechanism, or sleep homeostat, and a circadian oscillator. The circadian oscillator, based in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), is responsible for the tendency to sleep during certain phases of the 24-hour cycle and the consolidation of sleep and wake into distinct episodes. The sleep homeostat is responsible for monitoring and reacting to the need for sleep, causing the urge to sleep to depend on prior amounts of sleep or wakefulness. While disruptions in the circuitry and the homeostatic processes involved in the regulation of sleep-wake behaviour is will documented in PD, the potential involvement of alterations of the circadian system have not been studied in detail. The aim of my thesis is to investigate alterations in the circadian timing system using two animal models of PD: the mouse and the non-human primate. Taken together, the studies show that disturbances of circadian functions occur after MPTP treatment in the non-human primate but not in the mouse model of PD. These results emphasize the limitations of the MPTP-treated mouse model of PD for the study of non-motor symptoms, and reinforce previous studies that question the adequacy of this model to replicate cardinal motor features of the disease. In contrast, results in the non-human primate model stress the importance of dopaminergic degeneration in the circadian organisation of behavioral sleep wake cycle in PD",

      "abstract": "After only Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease. The incidence of this disease increases with age, especially for those above 70 years old. There are many risk factors that are well-established in the contribution to the development of PD, such as age, gender, ethnicity, rapid eye movement sleep disorder, high consumption of dairy products, traumatic brain injury, genetics, and pesticides/herbicides. Interestingly, smoking, consumption of caffeine, and physical activities are the protective factors of PD. A deficiency of dopamine in the substantia nigra of the brainstem is the main pathology. This, subsequently, alters the neurotransmitter, causing an imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory signals. In addition, genetics is also involved in the pathogenesis of the disease. As a result, patients exhibit characteristic motor symptoms such as tremors, stiffness, bradykinesia, and postural instability, along with non-motor symptoms, including dementia, urinary incontinence, sleeping disturbances, and orthostatic hypotension. PD may resemble other diseases; therefore, it is important to pay attention to the diagnosis criteria. Parkinson’s disease dementia can share common features with AD; this can include behavioral as well as psychiatric symptoms, in addition to the pathology being protein aggregate accumulation in the brain. For PD management, the administration of pharmacological treatment depends on the motor symptoms experienced by the patients. Non-pharmacological treatment plays a role as adjuvant therapy, while surgical management is indicated in chronic cases. This paper aims to review the etiology, risk factors, protective factors, pathophysiology, signs and symptoms, associated conditions, and management of PD.",

      "title": "Cardiovascular dysautonomia and cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease (Review)",
      "abstract": "Cognitive impairment is a prevalent non-motor symptom of Parkinson's disease (PD), which can result in significant disability and distress for patients and caregivers. There is a marked variation in the timing, characteristics and rate at which cognitive decline occurs in patients with PD. This decline can vary from normal cognition to mild cognitive impairment and dementia. Cognitive impairment is associated with several pathophysiological mechanisms, including the accumulation of β-amyloid and tau in the brain, oxidative stress and neuroinflammation. Cardiovascular autonomic dysfunctions are commonly observed in patients with PD. These dysfunctions play a role in the progression of cognitive impairment, the incidents of falls and even in mortality. The majority of symptoms of dysautonomia arise from changes in the peripheral autonomic nervous system, including both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. Cardiovascular changes, including orthostatic hypotension, supine hypertension and abnormal nocturnal blood pressure (BP), can occur in both the early and advanced stages of PD. These changes tend to increase as the disease advances. The present review aimed to describe the cognitive changes in the setting of cardiovascular dysautonomia and to discuss strategies through which these changes can be modified and managed. It is a multifactorial process usually involving decreased blood flow to the brain, resulting in the development of cerebral ischemic lesions, an increased presence of abnormal white matter signals in the brain, and a potential influence on the process of neurodegeneration in PD. Another possible explanation is this association being independent observations of PD progression. Patients with clinical symptoms of dysautonomia should undergo 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring, as they are frequently subtle and underdiagnosed.",

      "title": "Parkinson syndrome",
      "abstract": "Genetic discoveries over the past 15 years indicate that distinct etiologic triggers can cause nigrostriatal degeneration. These discoveries indicate that Parkinson disease (PD) is actually a syndrome (Parkinson syndrome [PS]), a cluster of signs and symptoms associated with dysfunction of a specific organ or system. Differing etiologies can give rise to common syndromic features. Hepatic failure, for example, has genetic, toxic, and infectious causes. Similarly, the nigrostriatal degeneration associated with the defining motor features of PS—resting tremor, bradykinesia, and rigidity—can result from different genetic causes. There are also hints of heterogeneity in sporadic PS. Clinicians, for example, have long suspected that tremor-predominant PS has a more benign course than PS dominated by postural instability and gait disorder, the so-called PIGD variant. It is increasingly clear that several brain circuits degenerate in PS and there is evidence that subjects with PS may differ in the degree of involvement of nondopaminergic brain systems. For example, degeneration of corticopetal basal forebrain cholinergic projections is common in PS but imaging evidence from Shimada et al.1 shows relative sparing of this system in some subjects with longstanding sporadic PS.",

      "abstract": "A Doenca de Parkinson (DP) e uma doenca cronica e progressiva do sistema nervoso, caracterizada por sinais de rigidez, acinesia, bradicinesia, tremor e instabilidade postural. Apresenta inicio insidioso, lento e progressivo. Constitui-se de etiologia idiopatica, porem, acredita-se que pode surgir de fatores ambientais e geneticos, gerando um desenvolvimento neurodegenerativo da Dopamina. Alem disso, estudos demonstram que o processo de envelhecimento esta interligado a essa afeccao, devido a perda de neuronios dopaminergicos com o passar dos anos. A DP inicialmente pode afetar apenas um lado do corpo, sendo que a medida que a doenca progride, pode envolver o corpo todo, diminuindo as habilidades motoras dos individuos portadores. Pacientes com DP apresentam desequilibrio e alteracoes posturais, pois sua habilidade para manter uma postura estavel pode estar comprometida. A instabilidade postural e as quedas sao comuns em pacientes com Parkinson, principalmente em estagios mais avancados da doenca. Estudos demonstram que as alteracoes provocadas na marcha resultam em quedas mais frequentes nesses pacientes se comparado a pessoas da mesma idade sem a patologia. Os disturbios posturais e desequilibrios sao os sintomas mais dificeis de serem tratados na DP, mas podem ser reduzidos com o acompanhamento. A fisioterapia, na grande maioria das vezes, esta indicada para tratamento da rigidez, da bradicinesia, na memoria postural para recuperacao do equilibrio e da postura. Com base nestes dados, o objetivo deste trabalho foi realizar uma revisao de literatura relacionando a Doenca de Parkinson e suas principais causas de quedas buscando artigos cientificos indexados nas bases de dados eletronicas: Scielo, Lilacs e Medline. Para esta pesquisa foram realizados os cruzamentos dos seguintes Descritores da Area da Saude (DeCS): Doenca de Parkinson e Quedas, bem como os mesmos descritores em portugues e ingles.

      "title": "Neural transplantation to neurodegenerative disorders",
      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's disease in the elderly population. Most Parkinson's disease cases are sporadic but about 5% of cases are familial, in which three causative genes have been identified: alpha-synuclein, PARK1 (Parkin), and PARK2 (ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1). Parkinson's disease is caused by selective neuron loss in substantia nigra and striatum, which results in a unique set of extrapyramidal signs and symptoms, such as tremor, muscle rigidity, akinesia, and postural and gait disturbance. It is well recognized that Parkinson's patients show some cognitive deficits. Lewy body is the characteristic cytoplasmic inclusion in neurons of the substantia nigra with Parkinson's disease and neurons of the cerebral cortex of Lewy body disease (LBD) in which cognitive decline is more easily detected. Some Parkinson's disease patients show significant cognitive decline, which leads to the clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease with dementia (PDD). The clinical entity of PDD and LBD is under discussion and it is important to clarify the relationship between PDD and LBD to understand the pathogenesis of cognitive impairment common to diseases with subcortical dementia. As shown in the guidelines published by the American Neurological Society, combined use of levodopa (L–DOPA) and dopamine agonists is the established pharmacological treatment for Parkinson's disease.1 However, there are, in most cases, several formidable problems during the course of pharmacotherapy used to treat Parkinson's patients. Neurologic (wearing-off phenomenon, on-off phenomenon, dyskinesia, dystonia) and psychiatric (hallucination and delusion) problems commonly occur through prolonged use of pharmacotherapy to treat Parkinson's patients. To overcome the difficulties associated with dopamine replacement and dopamine agonists, newer drugs have been developed, such as dopamine release stimulating drugs (amantadine), noradrenaline replacement (doroxy–DOPA), monoamine oxydase inhibitor (selegiline) and so on. Though dopaminergic drugs increase the level of dopamine in the striatum, they do not directly aim to restore or remedy the underlying mechanism of neuronal degeneration. Aiming for better and permanent clinical benefits, neural tissue transplantation for Parkinson's disease patients was initiated in the late 1970s. Since the first clinical trial of neural tissue transplantation for Parkinson's patients that showed remarkable clinical improvement, more than 200 Parkinson's patients have had transplants. Clinical benefits including improvement in neurological symptoms, prolongation of the on-period under L–DOPA therapy and reduction of the dose of L–DOPA have been reported.2 When neuronal tissue is transplanted, the donor cells survive to extend their neuronal processes into the host striatum. Survival and extension of neurites from the transplanted neurons is evident in the autopsied brain of the recipient,3 which explains why neural transplantation has long term effects, lasting more than 10 years.4 Based upon these positive findings, the first double-blind study of neural tissue transplantation for severe Parkinson's disease patients was reported in 2001.5 Forty patients who were between 34 and 75 years of age with severe Parkinson's disease (mean duration 14 years) were randomly assigned to receive either an actual transplant of nerve cells or undergo sham surgery and all were followed in a double-blind manner for 1 year. In the transplant recipients, cultured mesencephalic tissue from four embryos was implanted into the putamen bilaterally. In the patients who underwent sham surgery, holes were drilled in the skull but the dura was not penetrated. The primary outcome was a subjective global rating of the change in the severity of disease, scored on a scale of −3.0 to +3.0 at 1 year, with negative scores indicating a worsening of symptoms and positive scores an improvement. The mean (±SD) scores on the global rating scale for improvement or deterioration at 1 year were 0.0 ± 2.1 in the transplantation group and −0.1 ± 1.7 in the sham-surgery group. Among younger patients (60 years and younger), a standardized test for Parkinson's disease revealed significant improvement in the transplantation group as compared with the sham-surgery group when patients were tested on the morning before receiving medication (P = 0.001 for scores on the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale; P = 0.006 on the Schwab and England scale). There was no significant improvement in older patients in the transplantation group. Fiber outgrowth from the transplanted neurons was detected in 17 of the 20 patients in the transplantation group, as indicated by an increase in 18F-fluorodopa uptake on positron-emission tomography or postmortem examination. After improvement in the first year, dystonia and dyskinesia recurred in 15% of the patients who received transplants, even after reduction or discontinuation of the dose of L–DOPA. Though human embryonic dopamine-neuron transplants are shown to survive in patients with severe Parkinson's disease, the clinical benefits are confirmed only in younger patients. The partly negative results from the double-blind study have provoked ethical arguments on the clinical application of neural tissue transplantation to patients with neurodegenerative disorders. Points of argument concerned with the study above are as follows: (i) whether sufficient scientific rationality of the study can be confirmed; (ii) whether it is permissible/ethical to drill holes into the cranial bone of the control subjects; and (iii) whether human embryonic brain tissue can be transplanted to other human individuals. All of the arguments listed raise ethical discussions on the acceptability of the neural tissue transplantation to neurodegenerative disease patients, including Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, epilepsy, brain infarction and Alzheimer's disease. Arguments relating to points one and two, above, have been raised only after seeing the negative results of the study. If the reported results were positive, this kind of discussion would not have been raised. Experimental therapeutic trial studies should be designed with the best knowledge available at the time obtained from animal studies. However, the purpose of the clinical trial study is to demonstrate whether it actually produces benefits to patients. There is always a chance of failure by definition. The above cited clinical study seems to be properly designed under the frontline scientific data available at the time and it is not fair to criticize the study only after knowing that it produced negative results. The argument summarized in point two can be redressed by consideration of the probable patient benefits hypothesized by the study. If the results of clinical trials are not satisfactory, there is always criticism insisting that we should have avoided possible harmful events to the enrolled subjects; however, these arguments are only made retrospectively. The meaningful and considerable argument is on the ethical debate concerning the use of human embryonic material. This point is different from ethical considerations common to clinical trials in general. It is not concerned with the detriment–benefit balance of the subjects in the trial but rather concerned with the limited supply of the biomaterial for the study. The argument originates from the fact that human embryonic material is not easy to obtain. Neurons are post-mitotic cells and the amount of neural tissue available for experimental therapeutics is limited. The practical obstacle of neural tissue transplantation is how we can supply the biomaterial, and this limitation is always linked to the ethical consideration. If we need four to six embryonic brains to rescue a Parkinson's patient, transplantation is unrealistic as a mass form of treatment. Considering the number of possible recipient Parkinson's patients, the supply source of human embryonic material is not sufficient. Owing to the development of gene engineering and stem cell technology, there are possible means to overcome this problem. Instead of relying on human embryotic material, tissue or organs from other vertebrates can be used. Genetically manipulated porcine is expected for the supply of xenograft transplantation in which major histocompatibility antigens (MHC) are deficient or replaced with those of humans to suppress the immunological rejection. Cell lines obtained from teratoma can be transformed to mimic the neural property, which can be used for neural cell transplantation. Actually, Layton Bioscience (Sunnyvale, CA, USA) reported clinical application of transformed cells to 12 patients with apoplexy. Immortalised cell lines with a built-in stop signal can be utilized as the neuronal source. ReNeuron produced a MHP36 cell line, which can proliferate at 33°C and differentiate at 37°C making use of the temperature-sensitive gene. The recent development of stem cell technology opens up the means of differentiation into neural cells. The stem cells can be proliferated and they can be differentiated into neural cells for transplantation. The final goal of stem cell technology is the use of the patients’ own neuronal stem cell to induce a self-repair process. The real question of neural tissue transplantation is concerned with the very sophisticated philosophical questions of the dignity of human individuality. From the beginning of the neural tissue transplantation trials, there has been an unsolved question as to whether the individuality of the human beings can remain unaffected after the addition of brain tissue from another individual. Since the brain is the central organ to determine the dignity of individual human beings, manipulation of the brain may cause a change in the function, which could alter the identity of the individual. There are many arguments for and against this ethical problem. It started with a simple question about the availability of transplant material. Neural tissue transplantation can be accepted because it is the tissue, not the hemisphere or brain lobe and the brain function is controlled by the organ as a whole. Opponents insist that addition of tissue or even a cell from another individual can affect the identity of the individual. This is related to our understanding of human personality. Some people argue that human personality is carried by the brain as the function, but others insist that the brain is the substrate of the personality, meaning that any modification or addition to the brain tissue could possibly affect the personality. Analogical arguments between the history of psychosurgery and neural transplantation have been made. Neural transplantation is different in quality from psychosurgery because transplantation aims to replace the damaged brain tissue by transplant while psychosurgery deprives the normal tissue. In actual neurosurgical operations, brain tumor as well as the surrounding normal tissue is removed. Taking for granted that the massive removal of the brain tissue is justified, surely only a small addition of brain tissue is acceptable. The opponents argue that there is a difference between removal and addition and that even a little addition from another individual can make a difference. Of course it is obvious that the whole brain cannot be replaced, but there should be some area which is not involved with personality and the tissue in that area can be modified. However, it is not always easy to distinguish which part of the brain is really essential. Take as an example motor function. We may be able to identify the area responsible for motor function and to isolate the area where only motor function is regulated. However, it is not always clear how we can differentiate psychiatric function and motor function considering the fact that some basal ganglia and cerebellum are involved in the cognitive process. The discussion is still contentious. It is clear that the aim of neural transplantation is to restore the original function. The question to be solved is how we can restore the damaged brain function preserving the originality of the individual personality. If there is any possibility of changing the original personality of the subjects, we should not go ahead with neural transplantation. We should try to find a secure means to preserve the original personality before we go on with neural transplantation. Multipotent neural precursors are found in the adult brain. Neural precursors possess the critical features of somatic stem cells and they support neurogenesis within restricted areas throughout adulthood. Since neural precursors can undergo extensive in vitro expansion, they have been proposed as a renewable source of neural precursors for regenerative transplantation in various central nervous system diseases. Recently, a successful clinical trial of neural precursor transplantation was reported on a chronic model of multiple sclerosis.6 Widespread demyelination and axonal loss are the pathologic hallmarks of multiple sclerosis. The multifocal nature of this chronic inflammatory disease affecting the central nervous system complicates cellular therapy and puts emphasis on both the donor cell origin and the route of cell transplantation. Pluchino et al. established synergenic adult neural stem cell cultures and injected them into an animal model of multiple sclerosis-experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in the mouse – either intravenously or intrascerebroventricularly.6 In both cases, significant numbers of donor cells entered into demyelinating areas of the central nervous system and differentiated into mature brain cells. Within these areas, oligodendrocyte progenitors markedly increased, with many of them being of donor origin and actively remyelinating axons. The functional impairment caused by EAE was almost abolished in transplanted mice, both clinically and neuropathologically. Thus, adult neural precursor cells promote multifocal remyelination and functional recovery after intravenous or intrathecal injection in a chronic model of multiple sclerosis. The potential of strategies such as this to treat neurologic damage on a wide front is impressive. Although some neurolodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's and Huntington's disease, are confined to specific brain regions, others like multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease, affect much broader areas. When the damage is confined, a local injection of neural precursors might be beneficial. But this would be an impractical means of coping with the widespread damage. It is an impressive finding that neural precursors injected into the blood or spinal fluid can find their way to the many areas where they are needed. If neural precursors have the ability to find their way to the damaged areas where they start to differentiate and work properly intrinsically, we can inject them into the blood stream and just let them go to the target areas where the regenerative process can be triggered by the neural precursors. This finding has a two-fold impact on regenerative technology. Neural precursors can reach the place where they are needed. At the same time, they can bypass the difficult ethical discussions of the human identity because they are to differentiate in the damaged areas essentially influenced by the milieu of the host brain tissue.",

Two cases of Parkinsonian syndrome occurring after starting therapy with calcium inhibitors (verapamil in one case and diltiazem in the other) are reported. Complete regression of the symptoms after withdrawing the drugs was strongly in favour of a causal relationship. The condition could be due to inhibition of the calcium channels in the central nervous system disturbing neurotransmission.

      "abstract": "This case demonstrates how orthostatic hypotension in the absence of typical symptoms of light-headedness/dizziness when changing posture, can contribute to the burden of falls in Parkinson's disease. At least one-third of people with severe orthostatic hypotension do not report typical symptoms, and this figure appears to be higher in patients with Parkinson's disease. This is important clinically as it can increase the difficulty in ascribing falls to orthostatic hypotension, especially given the other competing reasons in Parkinson's disease and orthostatic hypotension symptoms can act as a prompt for the patient to act to prevent falls-related injuries. There is a clinical requirement, therefore, to screen for and manage orthostatic hypotension in patients with Parkinson's disease to prevent falls, even in those who do not report typical symptoms.",

Many of these symptoms can be addressed by allied health therapies, including physical therapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, and psychological therapies. However, referrals to these services early in the disease are low. We provide a review summarizing the efficacy of proactive allied health interventions on motor and nonmotor symptoms and daily function in prodromal and early disease. We also highlight areas for additional research and provide recommendations to improve care for individuals with early PD within each discipline. We recognize the overlapping roles of the allied health disciplines and support integrated or transdisciplinary care beginning soon after diagnosis to help stem the tide in the progression of PD symptoms and disability.",

Bei Patienten mit ParkinsonKrankheit finden sich kognitive Defizite bei 40 bis 80% der erkrankten Personen. Obwohl im Durchschnitt mehr als 40% der Patienten mit zentralnervosen neurologischen Erkrankungen an kognitiven Leistungseinbusen leiden, werden kognitive Storungen als klinischer Parameter in der Diagnostik und Therapie haufig nicht berucksichtigt. Mittels neuropsychologischer Testverfahren konnen die betroffenen Domanen klinisch identifiziert und naher klassifiziert werden. Neben der Demenz finden sich bei den Patienten ebenfalls psychische und Verhaltenssymptome wie emotionale Verstimmungen, Depressionen, Angstzustande und vermehrte Aggressionsausbruche sowie Veranderungen der Personlichkeit. All diese Faktoren fuhren zu einer zunehmenden Beeintrachtigung und haben einen erheblichen Einfluss auf die Lebensqualitat nicht nur des Betroffenen, sondern fuhren ebenfalls zu einer zunehmenden Belastung der Angehorigen, verandern die Krankheitsprognose und stellen im fortgeschrittenen Stadium einen der wichtigsten Grunde fur eine Heimeinweisung dar. Bei vielen neurologischen Erkrankungen sind die neurologischen Kardinalsymptome bereits einer medikamentosen Behandlung zuganglich, wahrend dies bei den kognitiven Symptomen schwieriger ist. Derzeit sind nur vier Medikamente zur Behandlung der Demenz zugelassen (Cholinesterasehemmer: Donepezil, Galantamin, Rivastigmin und der NMDA-Antagonist Memantin), die aber uber die AlzheimerDemenz hinaus, meist keine Zulassung fur kognitive Storungen bei anderen neurologischen Erkrankungen besitzen. Die Studienlage ist fur die Cholinesterasehemmer und Memantin fur den Einsatz bei kognitiven Defiziten bei neurologischen Erkrankungen ungenugend.

      "title": "Etiology of Late Onset Seizures",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:\r\nA ‘seizure’ (meaning “to take possession of”) is a paroxysmal event due to abnormal, excessive, hyper synchronous discharges from an aggregate of central nervous system neurons. Depending on the distribution of discharges, this abnormal CNS activity’s manifestations\r\ncan range from dramatic convulsive activity to experiential phenomena unidentified by the observer. A seizure needs to be distinguished from epilepsy. Epilepsy is described as the condition in which the patient has\r\nrecurrent seizures due to a chronic, underlying process. This definition implies that a person with a single seizures, or recurrent seizure due to correctable or avoidable circumstances, does not necessarily have\r\nepilepsy. Epilepsy can be defined as 2 or more unprovoked seizures. Seizures are separable as convulsive and non convulsive, depending on the prominence of motor features. They are also distinguished as focal or non focal. Seizures with an immediate or proximate cause, such as an acute metabolic disturbance, infection, or\r\nhead trauma, are symptomatic or provoked. In other instances, seizures that may result from past brain injury can be described as remote symptomatic.\r\nIn large number of people, a cause is not identifiable. These seizures are classified to be either idiopathic or cryptogenic. The term idiopathic refers to disease from an unknown cause and is presumed to have a genetic basis. The term cryptogenic implies a symptomatic cause\r\nundiagnosable with current medical technology.\r\nAIM OF THE STUDY:\r\n• To study the clinical profile of patients with new onset seizures after 40 yrs of age.\r\n• To find the etiology of seizures in adult population using clinical methods, CT Scan and Electroencephalography.\r\nMATERIALS AND METHODS:\r\n50 patients, above 40 yrs of age, admitted with new onset seizures in medical wards of Government Stanley Hospital during June 2009 to October 2009.\r\nPatients with history of seizures in childhood or any time in past were excluded from the study.\r\nPatients with episodes mimicking seizures like syncope, TIAs and pseudo seizures were identified and excluded from the study.\r\nA detailed history of presenting complaints, details of the seizures, relevant past and personal history were obtained from the patient and reliable attendees. Details of the seizures included:\r\n• First attack,\r\n• Last attack,\r\n• Type of seizures,\r\n• Part of body involved,\r\n• Duration,\r\n• Frequency,\r\n• Maximum period of freedom,\r\n• Time of attack,\r\n• Precipitating factors,\r\n• Aura,\r\n• Post-ictal symptoms,\r\n• Automatisms.\r\nPast history included\r\n• Hypertension, inc. PIH,\r\n• Diabetes mellitius,\r\n• Head injury,\r\n• Previous stroke,\r\n• Cardiovascular (RHD/ MVP/ IHD),\r\n• Respiratory illnesses( COPD/ PTB/ BA),\r\n• Renal transplant,\r\n• Psychiatric illnesses,\r\n• Jaundice,\r\nPersonal history included\r\n• Smoking,\r\n• Drugs,\r\n• Alcohol,\r\n• Snuff,\r\n• Other addictions,\r\n• Pork,\r\n• Sleep,\r\n• Sexual promiscuity.\r\nA detailed general examination, including vital signs recording, complete neurological examination and examination of other systems was done.\r\nNeurological examination included\r\n• Neurocutaneous markers,\r\n• Focal deficits,\r\n• Confusional state,\r\n• Fundus.\r\nInvestigations like Blood counts, Random blood sugar, Renal function tests, Electrolytes, Chest X Ray, ECG, CT Brain- Plain, and EEG were done for all patients.\r\nCT Scans were noted for any clearly abnormal focal lesions. If suspicious lesions were found, a contrast CT Scan/ MRI was obtained depending on the situations.\r\nIn case of acute febrile illness or signs of meningeal irritation associated with the seizures,\r\n• QBC- for malarial parasite and\r\n• Cerebrospinal fluid analysis was done.\r\nLumbar puncture for CSF analysis was done under aseptic\r\nprecautions. CSF was analysed for:\r\n• Biochemistry: Sugar, proteins,\r\n• Cell count: Total, differential,\r\n• Cytology,\r\n• Culture and sensitivity,\r\n• Ziehl-nielson staining,\r\n• When these showed abnormalities, anti HSV antibodies were done when relevant.\r\nIn suspicious patients, like those who had tuberculoma-brain, viral encephalitis, HIV-ELISA and VDRL were done.\r\nCardiac evaluation was done for patients with abnormal physical findings in cardiovascular system, abnormal ECG and for all patients with cerebrovascular etiology (cerebral infarction and intracerebral haemorrhage).\r\nEEG was done for all the patients irrespective of whether an underlying cause was found or not.\r\nThe clinical profile, brain imaging findings, EEG findings were all analysed to derive and etiological diagnosis for the seizures.\r\nCONCLUSIONS:\r\n1. Though late onset seizures was most common in the age group of 50-60 yrs (38%), there was not any significant difference between the other age groups. 36% were seen in the age group 40-5o yrs and 26% in > 70yrs.\r\n2. Males were 1.6 times more in number than females in patients presenting with late onset seizures.\r\n3. Generalised tonic clonic seizures were the commonest (50%), then partial seizures with secondary generalisation (26%), complex partial seizures (20%) and the last being simple partial seizures (4%).\r\n4. Family history does not seem to be relevant in patients with late onset seizures.\r\n5. 28 patients (56%) of patients had significant imaging findings pointing towards the diagnosis. Imaging is the most important factors determining the etiology of seizures. So every patient with new onset of seizures should undergo some form of imaging, CT- Plain/contrast or MRI- Brain depending on the situation as a part of\r\nevaluation.\r\n6. EEG did not contribute much to the diagnosis of etiology of the seizures.\r\n7. The most common etiology for late onset seizures was\r\ncerebrovascular accidents, ischemic events more commonly causing seizures than haemorrhagic events.\r\n8. This was followed by alcoholic withdrawal state, then granulomas and brain tumours.\r\n9. From the study, it is clear that most of the seizures in late adulthood are symptomatic (86%). So every care must be taken to evaluate the cause of new onset seizures in adults.",

The disturbance of purposive movements cannot be termed apraxia, however, if the patient suffers from any elementary motor or sensory deficit (i.e., paresis, dystonia, ataxia), which could fully explain the abnormal motor behavior, or if it results from a language comprehension disorder or from dementia (1,2). Nevertheless, praxic errors are well defined clinically and kinematically and can be superimposed on elementary motor disorders (3,4). Praxic disturbances may affect specific parts of the body (i.e., limb apraxia, buccofacial apraxia, gait apraxia) and may involve both sides of the body (i.e., ideational and ideomotor apraxias), preferentially one side (i.e., limb-kinetic apraxia) or, alternatively, interlimb coordination, as in the case of gait apraxia.",

Problems in diagnosis arise because of confusion of terminology, language difficulties, symptoms resembling noncardiac disease or vice versa, and the coexistence of angina pectoris with disease of other organs. Problems in differential diagnosis arise because symptoms resembling angina may result from disease or abnormal function of the brain, skeletal system, gastrointestinal system, or structures in the bony thorax or within the thoracic cage. The most difficult problems in differential diagnosis arise from psychoneurosis and gallbladder disease. Careful history taking will resolve the problem in most instances, prolonged observation will settle the question in others. To date, no objective tests have been adequate to determine whether or not the patient is subject to attacks of pain due to the physiologic effects of coronary artery pathology or dysfunction.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease (PD) and other neurologic conditions are now the leading cause of health loss and disability around the world, affecting nearly half of the world's population. Affecting about 1% of population older than 60 years, the PD is among common neurologic disorders, which causes progressive disability that can only be slowed, but not cured, by treatment. Once patients display symptoms like rigidity, bradykinesia, or tremor it's most probably too late for neuroprotective therapy because 70% of the dopaminergic neurons are already dead. With early preclinical diagnosis, we should be able to identify the preclinical phase of Parkinson's disease and include these patients in future trials for neuroprotection. The goal of medical management of PD is to provide control of signs and symptoms for as long as possible while minimizing adverse effects. Several primary neurodegenerative disorders distinct from PD share parkinsonian features of bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor, and balance disturbances. All these disorders share common features of PD, thus being collectively named Parkinson-plus syndromes. An inadequate response to treatment in a patient with parkinsonian symptoms suggests the possibility of Parkinson-plus syndrome. Clinically, however, 4 separate Parkinson-plus syndromes have been identified, as follows: Multiple system atrophy (MSA), Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), Corticobasal ganglionic degeneration (CBD), Dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB).",

      "abstract": "Benign tremulous parkinsonism, a tremor dominant syndrome with a relatively slow rate of deterioration, is recognized by clinicians although its pathological basis is not well understood. A systematic review of Queen Square Brain Bank donors was carried out to determine the natural history and pathology of individuals who had tremor dominant parkinsonism with mild non‐tremor components and minimal gait disability for at least 8 years. We identified 16 cases of pathologically proved benign tremulous Parkinson's disease (PD); another 5 individuals conformed to the definition but did not have the pathology of PD. Patients with verified benign tremulous PD had less severe neuronal loss in the substantia nigra than controls (χ 2 : P = .003). Twelve of these had been correctly diagnosed with PD at their first neurological evaluation, whereas the other 4 were originally thought to have another tremor disorder. The only consistent distinguishing feature of the 5 pathologically disproved cases, who may have had either essential tremor with associated rest tremor or dystonic tremor, was a failure to develop unequivocal bradykinesia within a decade of onset of tremor at rest. Our findings support the existence of a distinct subgroup of benign tremulous PD. The slower rate of clinical progression correlates with less severe nigral cell loss at postmortem, although many of these patients transgress the benign tremulous parkinsonism definition by the final third of their disease course and develop the common features of advanced PD. © 2012 Movement Disorder Society",

Non-oral therapies may be appropriate for those in the complex stage of the disease who experience motor fluctuations, but there can be reasons for a failure to explore these options. Complex Parkinson's disease is a challenging time for the patient, their carer/s and for Parkinson's specialists. Changes to independence can be difficult to deal with, and the disease has an impact both physically and psychologically. For carers, the impact of Parkinson's can also result in physical and psychological issues, as well as social and financial problems. Consideration often turns to moving into a care environment, dealing with neuropsychiatric issues and challenging unmet need. Dealing with symptoms and problems using a team and a palliative approach is required.",

While some of these deficits may be explained by the presence of major depression, frontal lobe-related cognitive impairments may result from an interaction between neuropathologic factors in PD and the mechanism of major depression.",

This chapter provides an overview of the different forms of parkinsonian and dyskinetic disorders. Molecular advances have revealed helpful schemata for classifying the principal degenerative parkinsonisms into alpha-synucleinopathies, including Parkinson's disease (PD), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and multiple system atrophy (MSA), tauopathies, including progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal degeneration (CBD) and others (e.g. cases with parkin mutations). The emergence of parkinsonism, dystonia or a tremor in an adolescent or young adult with slurred speech should always raise the possibility of Wilson's disease (WD), particularly if there is a family history of hepatic, psychiatric or neurological disorder in childhood. The chapter discusses the causes, diagnosis, clinical features, treatment and neurological assessment of tremor, dystonia, myoclonus, tics, chorea, psychogenic movement disorders and other movement disorders.",

      "abstract": "The diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease (PD) follows the UK Brain Bank Criteria, which demands bradykinesia and one additional symptom, i.e. rigidity, resting tremor or postural instability. The latter is not a useful sign for the early diagnosis of PD, because it does not appear before Hoehn and Yahr stage 3. Early symptoms of PD which precede the onset of motor symptoms are hyposmia, REM sleep behavioral disorder, constipation, and depression. In addition, an increasing number of patients whose PD is related to a genetic defect are being described. Thus, genetic testing may eventually develop into a tool to identify at-risk patients. The clinical diagnosis of PD can be supported by levodopa or apomorphine tests. Imaging studies such as cranial CT or MRI are helpful to distinguish idiopathic PD from atypical or secondary PD. SPECT and PET methods are valuable to distinguish PD tremor from essential tremor if this is clinically not possible. Using all of these methods, we may soon be able to make a premotor diagnosis of PD, which will raise the question whether early treatment is possible and ethically and clinically advisable.",

      "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases are characterized by progressive loss of neurons in the central nervous system. The disorders are clinically well-defined as a disease-related dementia, Alzheimer's disease the most typical case, or as a movement disorder, Parkinson's disease (PD). The risk of developing these diseases increases significantly with age: Parkinson's disease affects 1% of the population over 65 years of age, rising to 2% for those over 80 years. Parkinson's disease is a common neurodegenerative disorder that often impairs motor skills and speech of the patient. PD is characterized by muscle rigidity, tremor, slowing of physical movement (bradykinesia) and in extreme cases, loss of physical movement (akinesia). In particular, PD is due to a loss of dopaminergic neurons (related to the neurotransmitter dopamine), and subcortical neurons in the brain. Replacement therapy with dopaminergic drugs (levodopa, pramipexole) effectively reverses all the symptoms and signs of the disease. After a changeable period of time, however, this excellent initial response to dopaminergic treatment is complicated by the appearance of disorders known as motor response complications (MRC). These complications are divided into two main categories: (i) fluctuations in motor response and (ii) the emergence of abnormal involuntary movements known as levodopa-induced dyskinesias (LID) (Konitsiotis, 2005). Generally, motor fluctuations appear first as a shortening of the initially soft and lasting dopaminergic response. For patients with advanced PD, a few hours after the administration of medication the patient begins to notice the reappearance of signs and symptoms of the disease. This is known as end of dose deterioration or This may happen several times a day, so the patient can actually spend several hours per day in an state. During the short visit with the neurologist, the patient may appear to be well and thus the neurologist misses the symptoms related to wearing off. As a result, changes in the recent drug treatment availability do not take place in time. It is now well known that early treatment of wearing-off fluctuations delay the onset of more severe complications in the future, as well as the appearance of LID. Therefore any strategy that can detect early changes associated with wearing off would provide a valuable clinical tool that would allow early treatment interventions.",

      "title": "Persistent Postural-Perceptual Dizziness",
      "abstract": "Persistent postural-perceptual dizziness (PPPD) is a common cause of dizziness and vertigo. This term was first described fairly recently by the International Classification of Vestibular Disorders in 2017. The symptoms include unsteadiness, vertigo or dizziness, lasting at least 15 days per month for 3 months or longer. The symptoms are exacerbated by upright posture, standing, walking or in the presence of various visual stimuli. The cause of this disorder is still unknown, although it is believed that it is related with the discoordination of the peripheral sensory and the central nervous systems. The onset of dizziness has been explained as the result of failure of integrating visual, vestibular and proprioreceptive signals into the central nervous system. The symptoms are often succeeding a previous vestibular disorder, e.g. vestibular neuronitis, benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), Ménière’s disease or other disorders. Psychological factors also play a part in the onset of PPPD – patients quite frequently present a history of anxiety, neurotic tendencies and depression. PPPD diagnosis is clinical, a thorough anamnesis and clinical examination are crucial. In order to diagnose PPPD correctly, a set of all five criteria, established by the Bárány society, should be met. The treatment is usually multimodal, consisting of vestibular rehabilitation, cognitive behaviour therapy, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) and serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI).This review describes the term of PPPD, the symptoms of the disease, epidemiology, etiology, pathogenesis, comorbidities, also the diagnostic criteria and treatment of PPPD. The purpose of this article is to educate about this disease and to encourage more research, as well to seek better care for patients, accomplished by a multidisciplinary team of healthcare professionals.",

We investigated whether patients diagnosed as Davison's PPD/S showed any definite proof of pyramidal and pallidal involvement, without findings suggestive of other nosological entities. Since Davison's original description, 15 other PPD/S cases have been reported, yet all lack proof of pyramidal or pallidal degeneration. Because of the dopa-responsiveness in all patients subsequent to Davison's report, we argue that these patients probably suffered from early-onset nigral parkinsonism or dopa-responsive dsystonia, rather than pallidal parkinsonism; in such cases, the presumed pyramidal Babinski could be a pseudobabinski (\"striatal toe\"). Secondary pallidopyramidal syndromes do occur, for example, in multiple system atrophy or Wilson's disease, but in these patients additional findings indicate diseases other than Davison's PPD/S. We conclude that the existence of PPD/S as a distinct clinico-pathological nosological entity, as proposed by Davison, is doubtful. In cases reported as Davison's PPD/S, the description \"pallidopyramidal\" seems to be a misnomer.",

Secondly more specific associations appear to exist between depression and particular physical disorders. These may turn out to be of particular etiological interest. The best examples are probably stroke and cardiovascular disease.

      "title": "Insomnia Caused by Medical Disorders",
      "abstract": "Virtually any medical condition can cause sleep disruption. The incidence of insomnia increases with age as medical problems increasingly occur, and patients with chronic insomnia are more likely to develop adverse health outcomes due to medical disease. There are multiple ways in which insomnia may be caused or aggravated by medical illness or bodily injury. Unpleasant stimuli can directly impede initiation of sleep, or they may cause frequent arousals or awakenings. Changes in basic systemic physiology (such as disorders of ventilation) may produce similar disruption in sleep continuity. There may be humoral changes that have direct neurochemical or neurophysiological effects, augmenting vigilance and lowering the threshold to arousal from sleep. The effects of acute and subacute sleep disruption can lead to chronic psychophysiological insomnia by creating the anticipation of disturbed sleep and by altering circadian entrainment, further accentuating the disruptive effects of the underlying medical condition. Difficulties with insomnia may persist long after the causative medical condition has been effectively managed.",

      "abstract": "Parkinsonism is a symptom complex which is seen in association with a variety of illnesses, either intrinsic to the nervous system or systemic in nature. The commonest cause is idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD). The major underlying pathology in PD is neuronal cell loss in the pigmented nuclei of the brain stem, most notably in the substantia nigra pars compacta. The nigral neurons project to the caudate and putamen and utilize dopamine as a neurotransmitter. The neurochemical mechanisms underlying nigrostriatal plasticity are thought to involve both pre- and postsynaptic mechanisms. On the basis of post-mortem neurochemical studies, an age-related deterioration in nigrostriatal function has been postulated. Positron emission tomography studies with these tracers have provided in vivo confirmation of this change and provide a method to follow these changes with increasing age. Patients with more advanced PD characterized by the \"on-off\" phenomena have a more marked depression of striatal radioactivity than do patients with less advanced disease.",

Das idiopathische Parkinson-Syndrom muss differenzialdiagnostisch von symptomatischen und im Rahmen anderer neurodegenerativer Erkrankungen auftretenden atypischen Parkinson-Syndromen abgegrenzt werden. Zusätzliche pharmakologische Tests und moderne bildgebende Verfahren ermöglichen gerade im Frühstadium der Erkrankung eine genauere diagnostische Einordnung. Für die Behandlung des idiopathischen Parkinson-Syndroms stehen zahlreiche Medikamente aus unterschiedlichen Wirkstoffklassen zur Verfügung. Die Medikation zielt darauf ab, die Neurotransmitterbalance wiederherzustellen. Mit einer medikamentösen Therapie wird begonnen, sobald eine signifikante Beeinträchtigung der Lebensqualität oder der Aktivitäten des täglichen Lebens vorliegt. Welches Medikament eingesetzt wird, ist insbesondere vom Alter und der Komorbidität abhängig.",

      "title": "Troubles du sommeil dans la maladie de Parkinson et les autres synucléinopathies",
      "abstract": "Notre premier objectif etait d'explorer des troubles du sommeil peu etudies chez des patients avec synucleinopathies (maladie de Parkinson (MP), demence en corps de Lewy (DCL), demence associee a la maladie de Parkinson (DMP) et atrophie multisystematisee (AMS)): l'insomnie d'une part et les comportements parasomniaques d'autre part. Parmi ces derniers, nous nous sommes surtout interesses aux comportements moteurs anormaux survenant lors du sommeil non-paradoxal (sommeil NREM) chez ces patients. Insomnie : Nos donnees ont montre que les symptomes d'insomnie sont plus frequents chez des patients avec une MP par rapport a des malades atteints d'autres pathologies chroniques. Les symptomes d'insomnie sont correles avec la duree de la MP, mais pas avec les symptomes et signes moteurs ou non-moteurs de la maladie (article 1). Comportements moteurs a partir d'eveils : Les patients avec MP, DCL/DMP et AMS rapportent souvent des comportements a expression motrice, simples et complexes, lies au sommeil, que nous proposons de regrouper sous le terme comportements parasomniaques ( parasomnia behaviors ). Dans tous ces episodes, les patients semblent se comporter comme s'ils etaient en train de vivre leurs reves ou une mise en scene onirique. A la video-polysomnographie, ces episodes surviennent soit dans une periode de sommeil paradoxal stable ou les mecanismes physiologiques d'abolition du tonus musculaire sont deficients, soit lors d'etats intermediaires de conscience entre le sommeil et un reveil qui se produit. Dans ce travail, nous decrivons systematiquement pour la premiere fois les aspects video-polysomnographiques des comportement parasomniaques NREM ( NREM Parasomnia Behaviors, NPBs dans une population selectionnee de patients avec une MP, DCL/DMP et AMS. Par une analyse quantitative du spectre des frequences EEG, nous avons montre que ces phenomenes sont probablement expliques par des mecanismes physiopathologiques differents par rapport aux troubles d'eveil (autrement dits parasomnies NREM) de l'enfance. Les NPBs sembleraient etre des phenomenes plutot rares, d'apparition tardive dans les synucleinopathies (article 3). Nous avons demontre que les comportements moteurs a partir d'eveils NREM etaient plus frequents chez les patients atteints de DCL/DMP que chez ceux atteints de la MP et nous faisons l'hypothese que leur presence soit un indicateur d'evolutivite vers un stade avance de la maladie plutot qu'un marqueur specifique de demence (article 2). D'un point de vue physiopathologique, les comportements observes lors des parasomnies du sommeil paradoxal et non-paradoxal pourraient etre vus comme des fenetres permissives pour l'exploration de l'activite mentale pendant le sommeil. Dans les NPBs cette fenetre serait representee par une defaillance des circuits de l'eveil ( arousal ), de l'attention et de la cognition lors des transitions du sommeil a la veille, tandis que dans le trouble du comportement en sommeil paradoxal (TCSP), par une defaillance des circuits du controle de l'atonie musculaire. En synthese, les resultats de nos travaux suggerent que l'insomnie et les comportements parasomniaques pourraient representer l'expression clinique d'une alteration fonctionnelle des circuits regulateurs du sommeil et de la veille et du declin cognitif lie a la neurodegenerescence de la MP, la DCL/DMP et l'AMS, leur presence etant un indicateur d'un stade evolutif avance de la maladie. Le TCSP comme modele physiopathologique pour etudier l'akinesie et la bradykinesie : Notre deuxieme objectif a ete la mise en place d'un protocole visant a enregistrer de facon couplee a une videopolysomnographie, les potentiels de champ local des neurones des noyaux sous-thalamiques (NSTs) pendant le sommeil et la veille chez des patients avec un TCSP secondaire a une MP au moyen d'electrodes implantees dans le but d'une stimulation a haute frequence des NSTs. Cette etude est basee sur l'observation que, dans la MP, les mouvements produits en sommeil paradoxal ne sont akinetiques mais proches de la normale. A ce jour, 3 patients ont pu etre recrutes et participer a cette etude (etude Reves Park NST).",

      "title": "Apathy in Parkinson’s Disease: Clinical Patterns and Neurobiological Basis",
      "abstract": "Apathy is commonly defined as a loss of motivation leading to a reduction in goal-directed behaviors. This multidimensional syndrome, which includes cognitive, emotional and behavioral components, is one of the most prevalent neuropsychiatric features of Parkinson’s disease (PD). It has been established that the prevalence of apathy increases as PD progresses. However, the pathophysiology and anatomic substrate of this syndrome remain unclear. Apathy seems to be underpinned by impaired anatomical structures that link the prefrontal cortex with the limbic system. It can be encountered in the prodromal stage of the disease and in fluctuating PD patients receiving bilateral chronic subthalamic nucleus stimulation. In these stages, apathy may be considered as a disorder of motivation that embodies amotivational behavioral syndrome, is underpinned by combined dopaminergic and serotonergic denervation and is dopa-responsive. In contrast, in advanced PD patients, apathy may be considered as cognitive apathy that announces cognitive decline and PD dementia, is underpinned by diffuse neurotransmitter system dysfunction and Lewy pathology spreading and is no longer dopa-responsive. In this review, we discuss the clinical patterns of apathy and their treatment, the neurobiological basis of apathy, the potential role of the anatomical structures involved and the pathways in motivational and cognitive apathy.",

      "abstract": "Although the risk of developing dementia increases with age, onset can be as early as the third or fourth decade of life. Genetic influences play a more important role in younger than in older people with dementia, so young onset dementia may cluster in families. Diagnosing young onset dementia is challenging. The range of possible presenting features is broad, encompassing behavioural, cognitive, psychiatric and neurological domains, and symptoms are often subtle initially. Frequently the complaints are misattributed to stress or depression, and the patient is falsely reassured that they are too young to have dementia. The most common causes of young onset dementia are early onset forms of adult neurodegenerative conditions and alcohol. Vascular dementia is the second most common cause of young onset dementia after Alzheimer's disease. Conventional vascular risk factors may be absent and diagnosis relies on imaging evidence of cerebrovascular disease. Obtaining a detailed history remains the most important part of the workup and usually requires corroboration by a third party. Undertaking a basic neurological examination is also important. Those with suspected young onset dementia should be referred to a neurology-led cognitive disorders clinic where available as the differenti diagnosis is considerably broader tha in older adults and requires specialist investigation.",

Review Summary: Nonmotor complications in PD occur commonly. The current understanding of cognitive dysfunction; neuropsychiatric manifestations including psychosis, impulsive control, and compulsive disorders, depression, anxiety and apathy; autonomic complications such as hypotension, erectile dysfunction, and urinary complications; sleep disorders and other nonmotor manifestations are summarized in this review. Conclusion: Nonmotor complications often carry a greater impact than motor features in PD. Therefore, hightened awareness and proper recognition of these features are critical in improving a Parkinson patient's quality of life.",

      "title": "Study of pathogenetic mechanisms of Parkinson's disease in neuronal cellular models",
      "abstract": "Η νόσος του Πάρκινσον (ΝΠ) είναι μια πολύπλοκη νευροεκφυλιστική διαταραχή που επηρεάζει το 2% του παγκόσμιου πληθυσμού άνω των 65 ετών. Η ΝΠ χαρακτηρίζεται από κινητικές διαταραχές που σχετίζονται με την προοδευτική απώλεια των ντοπαμινεργικών νευρώνων της συµπαγούς µοίρας της µέλαινας ουσίας, ενώ ένα ευρύ φάσμα μη κινητικών συμπτωμάτων είναι επίσης παρόντα, όπως ψυχιατρικές διαταραχές και νοητική δυσλειτουργία. Το νευροπαθολογικό χαρακτηριστικό της ΝΠ είναι η ανώμαλη εναποθέση πρωτεϊνών σε νευρικά κύτταρα και νευρίτες, που ονομάζονται αντιστοίχως σωμάτια και νευρίτες Lewy. Αυτά είναι πρωτεϊνικά συσσωματώματα που αποτελούνται κυρίως από την πρωτεΐνη α-συνουκλεΐνη, που είναι η κύρια πρωτεΐνη που συνδέεται με την σποραδική μορφή της νόσου. Η α-συνουκλεΐνη ανήκει στην κατηγορία αμυλοειδών πρωτεϊνών που σχηματίζουν ειδικές ολιγομερείς μορφές και συσσωματωμάτα με αποτέλεσμα να οδηγεί σε νευροτοξικότητα μέσω διαφόρων μοριακών οδών. Αρκετές σημειακές μεταλλάξεις (A30P, E46K, A53T, G51D) και διπλασιασμοί/τριπλασιασμοί του γονιδίου της α-συνουκλεΐνης ( SNCA) οδηγούν σε οικογενείς μορφές της νόσου. Μεταξύ των διαφόρων μεταλλάξεων, η μετάλλαξη Α53Τ παρουσιάζει μειωμένη διαλυτότητα, ύστερα από επώαση σε υδατικό διάλυμα, σε φυσιολογική θερμοκρασία και αυτό οδηγεί στην δημιουργία ινιδίων με αποτέλεσμα την εκτεταμένη συσσώρευση αδιάλυτων αποθέσεων στον ανθρώπινο εγκέφαλο.Παρά τις εκτεταμένες προσπάθειες για την κατανόηση της παθογένεσης της ΝΠ, δεν υπάρχουν φάρμακα για την θεραπεία της νόσου. Επί του παρόντος, διατίθενται μόνο συμπτωματικές ή ανακουφιστικές θεραπείες χωρίς καμία να είναι ικανή να αποτρέψει ή να επιβραδύνει την πρόοδο της νόσου. Η λεβοντόπα (σε συνδυασμό με καρβιντόπα/βενζεραζίδη) αποτελεί την πιο αποτελεσματική φαρμακευτική θεραπεία, η οποία εντοπίστηκε πριν από 55 χρόνια. Ωστόσο, η χρόνια χορήγηση της οδηγεί σε σοβαρές παρενέργειες. Ως εκ τούτου, η ανάπτυξη νέων φαρμάκων που να τροποποιούν την πορεία της νόσου είναι μια επείγουσα ανάγκη. Οι περισσότερες σύγχρονες προσπάθειες για τον εντοπισμό νέων θεραπειών στοχεύουν τη συσσώρευση της α-συνουκλεΐνης ως τον κύριο παθογόνο παράγοντα που προκαλεί κυτταρική τοξικότητα. Οι εναλλακτικές στρατηγικές για την αντιμετώπιση των πρώιμων σταδίων του νευροεκφυλισμού, ιδιαίτερα με αμερόληπτο τρόπο, έχουν προχωρήσει με σχετικά αργό ρυθμό. Οι πρόσφατες εξελίξεις στα μοντέλα της ασθένειας που βασίζονται στα επαγόμενα πολυδύναμα βλαστοκύτταρα (iPSCs) που προέρχονται από ασθενείς, επιτρέπουν τον εντοπισμό πρώιμων παθολογικών φαινοτύπων και παρέχουν συστήματα για την ανακάλυψη νέων φαρμάκων. Σε συνδυασμό με τεχνολογίες ελέγχου υψηλής απόδοσης, αυτές οι προσεγγίσεις ανοίγουν νέες προοπτικές για την ανακάλυψη εν δυνάμει θεραπευτικών μορίων.Οι κινάσες έχουν αναδειχθεί ως ένας από τους πιο εντατικά διερευνώμενους φαρμακευτικούς στόχους στην τρέχουσα φαρμακολογική έρευνα, λόγω του κομβικού τους ρόλου στη διαμόρφωση ενός ευρέος φάσματος κυτταρικών διεργασιών. Μεγάλη προσπάθεια έχει καταβληθεί για την ανάπτυξη μορίων που στοχεύουν ειδικά το ανθρώπινο κίνωμα (human kinome). Μέχρι σήμερα, η πλειονότητα των μορίων παρουσιάζει ένα φάσμα αναστολέων των κινασών, με &gt;250 να βρίσκονται σήμερα σε κλινικές δοκιμές και 48 να έχουν εγκριθεί από τον FDA των ΗΠΑ, κυρίως για τη θεραπεία κακοηθειών. Ενώ αρχικά η χρήση των αναστολέων κινασών επικεντρώθηκε στη θεραπεία του καρκίνου, πλέον συμπεριλαμβάνει ένα διευρυμένο φάσμα θεραπευτικών περιοχών, όπως οι αυτοάνοσες και φλεγμονώδεις νόσοι, καθώς και νευροεκφυλιστικές διαταραχές, συμπεριλαμβανομένης της ΝΠ.Καθώς το κύριο χαρακτηριστικό της ΝΠ είναι ο θάνατος των ντοπαμινεργικών νευρώνων της μέλανας ουσίας, στην παρούσα μελέτη εστιάζουμε στον εντοπισμό μορίων που ενισχύουν τη διαφοροποίηση και την επιβίωση αυτών των νευρώνων χρησιμοποιώντας ως πειραματικό μοντέλο τα επαγόμενα βλαστικά κύτταρα (iPS) από υγιή άτομα και από ασθενείς με ΝΠ που φέρουν την A53T μετάλλαξη στην α-συνουκλεΐνη (G209A στο γονίδιο SNCA).Χρησιμοποιήσαμε μια βιβλιοθήκη μικρών μορίων αναστολέων κινασών για να πραγματοποιήσουμε διαλογή υψηλού περιεχομένου προκειμένου να ανιχνεύσουμε μόρια που επάγουν τη διαφοροποίηση ή/και την επιβίωση των ντοπαμινεργικών νευρώνων και αναστρέφουν τη νευροεκφύλιση.Προηγούμενη μελέτη του εργαστηρίου οδήγησε στην δημιουργία ενός μοντέλου νευρώνων που προέρχονται από επαγόμενα πολυδύναμα βλαστοκύτταρα ασθενών με οικογενή ΝΠ που φέρουν τη μετάλλαξη A53T της α-συνουκλεΐνης. Στο μοντέλο αυτό οι νευρώνες εμφανίζουν φαινοτύπους σχετικούς με τη νόσο, συμπεριλαμβανομένης της συσσώρευσης πρωτεϊνών, της μειωμένης νευριτικής ανάπτυξης και των παραμορφωμένων ή κατακερματισμένων νευραξόνων που περιέχουν α-συνουκλεΐνη και tau. Στην παρούσα μελέτη, προσαρμόσαμε επιτυχώς αυτό το κυτταρικό σύστημα σε πλάκες 384 φρεατίων για να πραγματοποιήσουμε την πρώτη σάρωση μικρών μορίων σε ανθρώπινους νευρώνες με την μετάλλαξη A53T. Δεδομένου ότι πολλές κινάσες έχουν εμπλακεί στην παθολογία της ΝΠ, εξετάσαμε μια συλλογή 273 αναστολέων κινασών για να ανακαλύψουμε ενώσεις με εν δυνάμει νευροπροστατευτικές ιδιότητες.Ανακαλύψαμε ότι ο αναστολέας πολλαπλών κινασών BX795 αναστρέφει σημαντικά τους φαινότυπους που σχετίζονται με τη νόσο. Μια μεμονωμένη δόση με BX795 παρέχει νευροπροστασία στους A53T νευρώνες βελτιώνοντας τη νευριτική ανάπτυξη, περιορίζοντας τα επίπεδα της παθολογικής α-συνουκλεΐνης και περιορίζοντας τον σχηματισμό συσσωματωμάτων, διατηρώντας παράλληλα την αξονική ακεραιότητα. Η νευροπροστασία επιβεβαιώθηκε επίσης σε ανθρώπινους νευρώνες που προέρχονται από iPSC στους οποίους η μετάλλαξη εισήχθη με επεξεργασία γονιδιώματος. Για τον εντοπισμό των κυτταρικών μονοπατιών που επηρεάζονται από το BX795, χρησιμοποιήσαμε μια αμερόληπτη προσέγγιση που βασίζεται στη συγκριτική πρωτεϊνική. Η αρχική σύγκριση μεταξύ A53T και νευρώνων ελέγχου απουσία BX795, αποκάλυψε διαφορική έκφραση 640 πρωτεϊνών από τις οποίες μόνο 67 εμφάνισαν μείωση, ενώ οι υπόλοιπες 573 αύξηση. Αυτή η μεγάλη αύξηση στην έκφραση πρωτεϊνών συνδέθηκε κυρίως με τις βιολογικές διεργασίες του μεταβολισμού του RNA, τη σύνθεση πρωτεϊνών, την τροποποίηση και μεταφορά, την αποικοδόμηση των πρωτεϊνών και την απόκριση στο στρες. Είναι ενδιαφέρον, ότι τα επίπεδα 118 πρωτεϊνών που βρίσκονται κυρίως εντός αυτών των βιολογικών διεργασιών και αντιπροσωπεύουν περίπου το 20% των συνολικών απορυθμισμένων πρωτεϊνών στους A53T νευρώνες, αποκαταστάθηκαν κατά τη θεραπεία με BX795. Η παρούσα μελέτη αποτελεί την πρώτη, καθόσον γνωρίζουμε, σάρωση υψηλού περιεχομένου και πρωτεϊνικής ανάλυσης που πραγματοποιήθηκε σε ανθρώπινους νευρώνες που προέρχονται από iPSC με την μετάλλαξη A53T για τον εντοπισμό νέων θεραπευτικών ουσιών για την ΝΠ.Αυτή η μελέτη αποτελεί την πρώτη μελέτη υψηλού περιεχομένου για την ανακάλυψη φαρμάκων που πραγματοποιείται σε ανθρώπινους νευρώνες που προέρχονται από A53T iPSC για τον εντοπισμό υποψήφιων θεραπευτικών ουσιών για την ΝΠ. Παρόλο που οι πρώτοι iPSC που προήλθαν από ασθενείς με ΝΠ δημιουργήθηκαν το 2009, παραδόξως μόνο δύο φαινοτυπικές σαρώσεις έχουν αναφερθεί μέχρι σήμερα σε νευρώνες που προήλθαν από iPSC για την ΝΠ. Για τον εντοπισμό τροποποιητικών παραγόντων της νόσου, οι Yamaguchi et al. καθιέρωσαν μια βασισμένη στην απεικόνιση, ημιαυτόματη, υψηλής απόδοσης δοκιμασία για την ποσοτική ανίχνευση της μιτοχονδριακής κάθαρσης και της κυτταρικής βιωσιμότητας σε ντοπαμινεργικούς νευρώνες από ασθενείς με οικογενή ΝΠ που έχουν μεταλλάξεις Parkin ή PINK1. Μετά από έλεγχο 320 φαρμακολογικά δραστικών ενώσεων αναστολέων οι ερευνητές εντόπισαν 4 ουσίες, την MRS1220, την τρανυλκυπρομίνη, τη φλουναριζίνη και τη βρωμοκρυπτίνη, οι οποίες βελτίωσαν την παθολογική κάθαρση των μιτοχονδρίων πιθανώς προωθώντας τη μιτοχονδριακή αποικοδόμηση μέσω του λυσοσωματικού συστήματος, χωρίς να διερευνήσουν περαιτέρω τον υποκείμενο μηχανισμό. Σε μια άλλη μελέτη οι Tabata κ.ά. πραγματοποίησαν φαινοτυπική διαλογή σε ντοπαμινεργικούς νευρώνες που προέρχονται από ασθενείς με Parkin (PARK2) και εμφανίζουν αυξημένη ευαισθησία στο μιτοχονδριακό στρες που προκαλείται από τη ροτενόνη, για τον εντοπισμό νευροπροστατευτικών ενώσεων. Από τη φαινοτυπική διαλογή μιας εγκεκριμένης από τον FDA βιβλιοθήκης φαρμάκων, βρέθηκε ότι ένας ανταγωνιστής των διαύλων ασβεστίου, η βενιδιπίνη, καταστέλλει την απόπτωση που προκαλείται από τη ροτενόνη. Η μελέτη μας είναι η τρίτη φαινοτυπική διαλογή που πραγματοποιείται σε ανθρώπινους νευρώνες που προέρχονται από iPSC στον τομέα της ΝΠ και η μόνη που σχετίζεται με την A53T παθολογία.Τα μονοπάτια που επηρεάζονται από τη μεταλλαγμένη α-συνουκλεΐνη στη μελέτη μας έχουν μεγάλη ομοιότητα με το συνάπτωμα που αναφέρθηκε από τους Chung et al για νευρώνες ποντικών και τις προβλέψεις του in silico \"ανθρωποποιημένου\" χάρτη της πρωτεοτοξικότητας που αναφέρθηκε στη συνοδευτική μελέτη των Khurana et al.Αναλύοντας περαιτέρω τις οδούς που επηρεάζονται από το BX795, αποδείξαμε ότι το BX795 ρυθμίζει την οδό mTORC1 για τον περιορισμό της υπερβολικής πρωτεϊνοσύνθεσης και τη διευκόλυνση της αυτοφαγίας. Επιπλέον, τα αποτελέσματά μας δείχνουν ότι η αποκατάσταση της πρωτεόστασης που ακολουθεί την σηματοδότηση mTOR μπορεί να έχει μακροπρόθεσμες ευεργετικές συνέπειες στην κυτταρική υγεία, υποκινώντας μόνιμες βασικές αλλαγές.Η κινάση mTOR είναι ένας κύριος ρυθμιστής του κυτταρικού μεταβολισμού που λειτουργεί σε δύο διακριτά σύμπλοκα: mTORC1 και mTORC2 με το πρώτο να εμπλέκεται στη βιοσύνθεση πρωτεϊνών και λιπιδίων μέσω ενός καταρράκτη σηματοδότησης που περιλαμβάνει τις πρωτεΐνες SK6 και 4E-BP1 . Σε αντίθεση με τα πολλαπλασιαζόμενα κύτταρα όπου το μονοπάτι αυτό χρησιμοποιείται για την ανάπτυξη και τη διαίρεση, στους νευρώνες δρα ως ρυθμιστής του υγιούς μεταβολισμού και της γήρανσης με τον περιορισμό του να σχετίζεται με την παράταση της διάρκειας ζωής και την καθυστέρηση των παθολογιών που σχετίζονται με την ηλικία. Οι A53T νευρώνες έχουν αυξημένες RPS6, IQGAP1 και RAG-GTPases, συστατικά του μονοπατιού mTORC1 και αυτό φαίνεται να σχετίζεται με αυξημένη μετάφραση ενός υποσυνόλου mRNAs που σχετίζονται με τον μεταβολισμό του RNA και την απόκριση στο στρες. Ομοίως, μια μελέτη ποσοτικής πρωτεομικής σε ένα προ-συμπτωματικό μοντέλο A53T Drosophila δείχνει σημαντική ρύθμιση των ριβοσωμικών πρωτεϊνών στις A53T μύγες. Παρόλο που η μηχανιστική σύνδεση μεταξύ της A53T α-συνουκλεΐνης και του mTORC1 δεν έχει ακόμη τεκμηριωθεί, πρόσφατα στοιχεία δείχνουν ότι η γενετική ποικιλομορφία στο μονοπάτι mTOR συμβάλλει στις επιδράσεις του γονιδίου SNCA στην παθογένεια της νόσου.Ταυτόχρονα με την προώθηση της πρωτεϊνοσύνθεσης ο mTORC1 δρα για την καταστολή της αυτοφαγίας μέσω της φωσφορυλίωσης του ULK1. Η αυτοφαγία έχει κεντρικό ρόλο στην προαγωγή της υγείας και της μακροζωίας, ενώ η διαδικασία αυτή διαταράσσεται στις νευροεκφυλιστικές νόσους και στην παθολογία αSyn. Το A53T-πρωτέωμα δείχνει ότι οι νευρώνες βρίσκονται υπό στρες, καθώς οι πρωτεΐνες που εμπλέκονται στην UPR ή στην απόκριση στρες λόγω θερμικού σοκ, στη συναρμολόγηση και ρύθμιση του πρωτεασώματος, που είναι γνωστό ότι ενορχηστρώνεται από το mTORC1 στους νευρώνες, είναι σημαντικά ρυθμισμένες. Η αποκατάσταση πολυάριθμων συστατικών του μεταβολισμού του RNA και των καταρρακτών πρωτεϊνικής μετάφρασης από το BX795 σχετίζεται άμεσα με τη μειωμένη απόκριση στο στρες που προκύπτει από τα χαμηλότερα επίπεδα των πρωτεϊνών που σχετίζονται με την UPR και το θερμικό σοκ που επίσης προσδίδονται από αυτό το μόριο. Παράλληλα, ένας σημαντικός αριθμός πρωτεϊνών που σχετίζονται με την ουβικουιτίνη/πρωτεάσωμα επανήλθε σε επίπεδα σχεδόν ελέγχου. Λαμβάνοντας υπόψη ότι τόσο το σύστημα ουβικουιτίνης/πρωτεασώματος όσο και η αυτοφαγία μοιράζονται πολλαπλούς μοριακούς καθοριστικούς παράγοντες, συμπεριλαμβανομένων των ULK1, ATG5, ATG8 και p62, οι οποίοι μπορούν να επηρεαστούν ταυτόχρονα και αμοιβαία στις νευροεκφυλιστικές νόσους, καθίσταται προφανές ότι το BX795 βοηθά στην εκκαθάριση των κακώς διπλωμένων πρωτεϊνών περιορίζοντας την πρωτεϊνοσύνθεση. Αυτό συμφωνεί με την αποδεδειγμένη ικανότητά του να μειώνει τα συσσωματώματα πρωτεϊνών σε p.A53T-νευρώνες, όπως φάνηκε στην παρούσα μελέτη, μαζί με τη διευκόλυνση της αυτοφαγίας τόσο σε κύτταρα SYSH-5Y που εκφράζουν την A53T α-συνουκλεΐνη όσο και σε νευρώνες που προέρχονται από ασθενείς.Το BX795 είναι ένας αναστολέας πολλαπλών κινασών που στοχεύει πολυάριθμες οδούς, συμπεριλαμβανομένων των κινασών TBK1 και PDK1. Παρόλο που στο σύστημά μας δεν παρατηρήθηκαν διαφορές στα συνολικά ή φωσφορυλιωμένα επίπεδα αυτών των δύο κινασών παρουσία του BX795 (τα δεδομένα δεν παρουσιάζονται), δεν μπορούμε να αποκλείσουμε ότι οι επιδράσεις του διαμεσολαβούνται μέσω αυτών των δύο κινασών, καθώς και οι δύο εμπλέκονται στη νευροεκφύλιση, τη σηματοδότηση mTOR και την αυτοφαγία. Ωστόσο, τέσσερις άλλοι αναστολείς της PDK1 που περιλαμβάνονταν στη βιβλιοθήκη Selleck δεν αναδείχθηκαν κατά τη διάρκεια της διαλογής. Η TBK1 προτάθηκε πρόσφατα ως ένας νέος παράγοντας που συνδέει την αυτοφαγία και τη νευροφλεγμονή στην ALS και έχει αποδειχθεί ότι ενεργοποιεί άμεσα το mTOR σε απόκριση σε αυξητικούς παράγοντες. Είναι ενδιαφέρον ότι διαπιστώσαμε ότι το BX795 μπορούσε να αναστείλει την καθαρισμένη ανασυνδυασμένη p70 S6K, τη σημαντικότερη κινάση που φωσφορυλιώνει την RPS6 in vivo, υποδεικνύοντας ότι η οξεία επίδραση της ένωσης στην RPS6 σε κύτταρα που εκφράζουν p.A53T θα μπορούσε να μεσολαβείται μέσω της αναστολής της p70 S6K. Είναι αξιοσημείωτο ότι πολλαπλοί άλλοι αναστολείς της φωσφορυλίωσης του mTOR που υπάρχουν στη βιβλιοθήκη αναστολέων κινάσης που εξετάστηκε (26 συνολικά, συμπεριλαμβανομένης της ραπαμυκίνης), απέτυχαν να επιδείξουν προστατευτικές επιδράσεις στο σύστημά μας. Λαμβάνοντας υπόψη ότι το BX795 έχει προταθεί να δρα μέσω διαφορετικών μηχανισμών σε διαφορετικές παθολογίες, μελλοντικές μηχανιστικές μελέτες θα πρέπει να αποκαλύψουν τους άμεσους στόχους του στους A53T νευρώνες. Το κατά πόσον αυτοί βρίσκονται εντός ή εκτός του κινώματος είναι ένα θέμα προς διερεύνηση, καθώς τα αναδυόμενα στοιχεία υποδεικνύουν ότι οι αναστολείς κινάσης μπορεί ακούσια να ασκούν τη θεραπευτική τους δράση μέσω μη κινάσης στόχων. Συλλογικά, η εργασία που παρουσιάζεται εδώ προσδιορίζει το BX795 ως μια πολλά υποσχόμενη ένωση με θεραπευτικό δυναμικό για ασθενείς με ΝΠ και άλλες διαταραχές διαμόρφωσης πρωτεϊνών. Περαιτέρω, η πειραματική μας προσέγγιση έριξε φως στα μοριακά και κυτταρικά μονοπάτια της πρωτεοτοξικότητας αποκαλύπτοντας νέους στόχους νόσου για την ανάπτυξη συνδυασμένων θεραπευτικών ουσιών.Οι πραγματικές μεταφραστικές δυνατότητες των πλατφορμών iPSC που προέρχονται από ασθενείς μόλις αναδύονται, καθώς πραγματοποιούνται περισσότερες αμερόληπτες σαρώσεις φαρμάκων μεγάλης κλίμακας. Οι εργασίες που πραγματοποιήθηκαν στο πλαίσιο της παρούσας διατριβής καταδεικνύουν ότι οι ανθρώπινοι νευρώνες με φαινοτυπικά χαρακτηριστικά που σχετίζονται με ασθένειες μπορούν να προσαρμοστούν αποτελεσματικά για χρήση σε σαρώσεις φαρμάκων υψηλής απόδοσης. Οι τρέχουσες εξελίξεις στον τομέα της τεχνολογίας iPSC, συμπεριλαμβανομένων βελτιωμένων πρωτοκόλλων για τη διαφοροποίηση των νευρώνων, της ανάπτυξης συστημάτων συν-καλλιέργειας και τρισδιάστατων (3D) συστημάτων ή της χρήσης μικρορρευστονικής ή τσιπ συσκευών brain-on-chip, θα μπορούσαν να συνδυαστούν με το τρέχον κυτταρικό σύστημα που περιγράφεται εδώ, ώστε να αυξηθεί η αξία του σε προσεγγίσεις διαλογής υψηλής απόδοσης. Μια σημαντική προσθήκη στον έλεγχο βιβλιοθηκών ενώσεων θα ήταν να συμπεριληφθούν ενδείξεις ανάγνωσης της λειτουργικότητας των νευρώνων, όπως για παράδειγμα η αξιολόγηση ηλεκτροφυσιολογικών παραμέτρων με συστήματα συστοιχιών πολλαπλών ηλεκτροδίων υψηλής απόδοσης. Σε συνδυασμό με βιβλιοθήκες siRNA σε όλο το γονιδίωμα, μηχανική μάθηση και καλύτερα εργαλεία πρόβλεψης in silico, τέτοιες πλατφόρμες μπορούν να αξιοποιηθούν περαιτέρω για την επιλογή νέων, αποτελεσματικότερων και ασφαλέστερων φαρμάκων που θα εισέλθουν με εμπιστοσύνη στις κλινικές δοκιμές.Είναι σημαντικό ότι η μελέτη μας υποστηρίζει ότι οι πλατφόρμες που βασίζονται σε ανθρώπινα iPSC και χρησιμοποιούνται στην πρώιμη ανακάλυψη φαρμάκων μπορούν επίσης να συμβάλουν στην αποκάλυψη μηχανισμών ασθενειών. Θα μπορούσαμε έτσι να εντοπίσουμε ένα νευροπροστατευτικό μόριο που διασώζει βασικές μεταβολικές οδούς, απαραίτητες για τη νευρωνική λειτουργία. Περαιτέρω μελέτες in vitro και in vivo σε μοντέλα ΝΠ, θα πρέπει να παράσχουν πρόσθετη εικόνα του μηχανισμού δράσης και της αποτελεσματικότητας του BX795 για να αποκαλύψουν πλήρως το μεταφραστικό δυναμικό του ως κορυφαίο θεραπευτικό φάρμακο για την ΝΠ.Συμπερασματικά, πολλές σειρές hiPSC έχουν παραχθεί από ασθενείς με οικογενή ή σποραδική ΝΠ αποκαλύπτοντας γνωστούς ή προηγουμένως μη αναγνωρισμένους φαινότυπους σχετικούς με τη νόσο, οι οποίοι, σε πολλές περιπτώσεις, θα μπορούσαν να αποκατασταθούν αποτελεσματικά με τη χρήση μικρών μορίων. Αυτές οι έρευνες έχουν θέσει το υπόβαθρο για την ανάπτυξη βιοδοκιμών για τον έλεγχο μικρών ή μεγαλύτερων χημικών βιβλιοθηκών σε αναζήτηση κύριων ενώσεων που μπορεί να εξελιχθούν σε θεραπευτικά προϊόντα που τροποποιούν τη ΝΠ. Ωστόσο, πρέπει ακόμη να καθιερωθούν ισχυρές δοκιμασίες προτού τα συστήματα που βασίζονται σε iPSC γίνουν πιο εύκολα προσιτά σε τεχνολογίες υψηλής απόδοσης. Εν τω μεταξύ, αναπτύσσονται πιο προηγμένα συστήματα συν-καλλιέργειας που περιλαμβάνουν νευρώνες και γλοιακά κύτταρα ή τρισδιάστατα εγκεφαλικά οργανοειδή που μιμούνται περισσότερο την in vivo ανθρώπινη κατάσταση, για να βοηθήσουν στις μελέτες της ΝΠ και στην ανακάλυψη φαρμάκων. Σημαντική είναι επίσης η ανάγκη για λειτουργικές δοκιμασίες για την πρόβλεψη της αποτελεσματικότητας των φαρμάκων, ενώ οι τεχνολογικές εξελίξεις καθιστούν πιο εφικτές τις πολύπλοκες σαρώσεις μορίων. Τέλος, η εμφάνιση της τεχνητής νοημοσύνης τα τελευταία χρόνια μπορεί να αποδειχθεί μια τεχνολογία που θα αλλάξει τα δεδομένα στην ανακάλυψη φαρμάκων. Παρ' όλα αυτά, οι ευκαιρίες και οι προκλήσεις παραμένουν ακόμη μπροστά μας προτού αυτές οι νέες τεχνολογίες καρποφορήσουν για την κατανόηση και τη θεραπεία του νευροεκφυλισμού στη ΝΠ.",

      "title": "Potential Novel Treatments for Parkinson’s Disease",
      "abstract": "This review aims to evaluate novel developments in treatments for Parkinson’s disease that focus on slowing, stopping, and/or reversing the neurodegeneration associated with the disease. Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease that affects dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, located in the basal ganglia of the brain. This region also contains high levels of alpha synuclein, a protein found abundantly in the brain due to its important role in neurotransmitter release. α-synuclein has been found to be misfolded and overexpressed in people with PD, which leads to fibril formation and aggregation, which directly interfere with basic cellular processes and results in neurodegeneration. In PD patients, dopaminergic neurons are most affected; therefore, an artificial supply of dopamine must be provided to them via dopamine precursors that can cross the blood-brain barrier. However, these medications fail to slow, stop, or reverse the progression of PD and merely pose as treatments for physical symptoms, such as tremors. Researchers are now focusing on 2 major avenues for new PD treatments: treatments that target α-synuclein aggregates/Lewy body assemblies and treatments that focus on replacement of lost dopaminergic neurons in the brain. The use of antibodies (immunotherapy) to target and clear αsynuclein aggregates or the upregulation of genes that encode autophagic mechanisms to destroy dysfunctional proteins were shown to reduce α-synuclein aggregation and behavioral deficits in mice. Results from clinical trials have shown a 96.5% reduction in the concentration of extracellular α-synuclein aggregates, and doses were well tolerated with no serious side effects. In order to rebuild the neurons that were lost to PD neurodegeneration, a renewable source of dopamine-producing cells that can integrate into the host brain and survive for years is required. More specifically, the reprogramming of astrocytes can be used to develop functional dopaminergic neurons. To reprogram the astrocytes and fibroblasts, the RNA binding protein PTB was suppressed; PTB suppresses numerous neuronal genes required for neuronal maturation, thus, downregulation of PTB generates functional, mature neurons. When in vivo astrocyte reprogramming was performed in a mouse model of PD, researchers found new, successful dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and increased dopamine levels. Although both avenues for treatment require further clinical trials and testing in human subjects, they both hold significant promise in the future.",

      "title": "Sleep disorders",
      "abstract": "The term sleep disorder (somnipathy) simply means a disturbance of an individual’s normal sleep pat­tern. Doctors typically see patients in whom the dis­turbance is having a negative effect upon physical, mental, or emotional functioning, but subclinical dis­turbances of sleep are common and something almost everyone will suffer at some point in their life. Sleep disorders are a heterogeneous group, ranging from the frequently experienced insomnia to the extremely rare hypersomnias such as Kleine– Levin syndrome. However, there are many shared characteristics and this chapter will concentrate mainly on providing a framework for assessment, diagnosis, and manage­ment in the generic sense, with some guidance on spe­cific disorders in the latter sections. A good working knowledge of basic sleep disorders is essential in all specialties of clinical medicine. As a general rule, sleep disorders within the general hos­pital environment tend to be poorly managed, with great detriment to the patient. There are a variety of reasons why it is important to be able to diagnose and treat sleep disorders: … ● Epidemiology: sleep disorders are very common and affect all ages. ● Co- morbidities: sleep disturbances may be a primary disorder or secondary to a mental or physical disorder. They are often prodromal symptoms of psychiatric conditions. ● Impact upon physical health: poor sleep is linked to increased mortality and morbidity from many pathologies (see ‘Consequences of inadequate sleep’, p. 405). ● Medications (not just psychotropics) often affect sleep. ● Sleep disturbance is an important part of many primary psychiatric conditions (e.g. mood disorders, psychosis, anxiety disorders); further information on these can be found in the chapter relating to each disorder. … Sleep is a natural state of bodily rest seen in humans and many animals and is essential for survival. It is different from wakefulness in that the organism has a decreased ability to react to stimuli, but this is more easily reversible than in hibernation or coma. Sleep is poorly understood, but it is likely that it has several functions relating to restoration of body equilibrium and energy stores. There are a variety of theories re­garding the function of sleep, which are outlined in Box 28.1.",

      "title": "New-onset progressive ataxia in a 66-year-old woman with longstanding Parkinson’s disease – a case report",
      "abstract": "Introduction: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder, and its diagnosis remains a clinical one. Hence, the emergence of new symptoms warrants consideration of a new diagnostic work-up even at later disease stages. Important differential diagnoses include atypical or symptomatic parkinsonism, like multiple system atrophy, normal pressure hydrocephalus, or rarely, superficial siderosis (SS). Case Presentation: A 66-year-old woman with longstanding PD presented to our clinic with a four-year history of progressive ataxia and gait impairment. The emergence of a new symptom (ataxia) prompted us to conduct a new, broad diagnostic work-up. Clinical examination revealed both parkinsonian (hypomimia, dyskinesias, right dominant bradykinesia and rigidity, intermittent resting tremor) and cerebellar signs (scanning dysarthria, gaze-evoked nystagmus, severe ataxia of extremities and gait). No signs or symptoms of autonomic dysfunction were present. Magnetic resonance imaging of brain and spine showed extensive hemosiderin depositions and ventral intraspinal fluid collection, establishing a diagnosis of SS. No apparent dural leak was detected in cerebrospinal fluid scintigraphy. The patient was treated with epidural blood patch. Conclusion: The occurrence of new symptoms in PD, especially “red flags” or exclusion criteria, calls for a repeated diagnostic work-up to exclude potentially treatable causes of parkinsonism. While SS has been reported as a cause of symptomatic parkinsonism, we favor a diagnosis of idiopathic PD and comorbid SS in this case. This case report highlights the clinical importance of diagnostic criteria in differentiating PD from atypical parkinsonian disorders or symptomatic parkinsonism as well as signs and symptoms, pathophysiological aspects, and treatment of SS.",

      "title": "Challenges for Epidemiological Research of Pesticide Exposure and Parkinson’s Disease",
      "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease (PD), a neurodegenerative disease affecting at least one million individuals in the US, is characterized by a progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra and the formation of Lewy bodies (inclusions composed of aggregated proteins) in the surviving neurons. Once approximately 70% of the dopaminergic neurons have been lost, the clinical signs of PD become apparent; these include resting tremor, muscular rigidity, and bradykinesia, among many other motor and non-motor manifestations. Increasing age is a major risk factor for PD, and as a consequence the disease prevalence and ensuing societal impact of the disease are expected to increase as the population ages in coming years. Despite this, the factors that trigger the pathological changes leading to PD remain unknown for the vast majority of cases. A slow progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons accompanies normal aging, and exposure to harmful environmental factors may cause PD by accelerating the rate of neuronal depletion. Alternatively, environmental exposures in early life may reduce the number of dopaminergic neurons to levels below those needed to maintain function upon age-related neuronal depletion in later life. In either case, the environmental impact may not be immediately evident, and the disease may appear years later when dopamine levels drop below the threshold required for normal function. 1 Investigators have long sought to identify harmful environmental factors leading to PD, particularly since the 1983 identification of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) as a causal agent. 2 MPTP contaminated a synthetic narcotic, leading to severe parkinsonism with features of classic PD in several young drug users. MPTP was later shown to act selectively on dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Since then, much epidemiological research has focused on the pathways leading to MPTP-induced parkinsonism. Structural and functional similarities exist between the active metabolite of MPTP (MPP+) and some pesticide chemicals, particularly paraquat. Given this, pesticide exposure has been examined in many epidemiological studies as a risk factor for PD, but some uncertainty remains. A meta-analysis of case-control studies conducted prior to 2001 showed that individuals with PD were 85% more likely to report being directly exposed to pesticides compared with unaffected individuals. 3",

      "title": "Depression associated with stroke",
      "abstract": "Serious physical illness naturally leads to emotional disturbance, particularly when the illness is disabling or life-threatening, so it is not surprising that stroke is associated with mood disorder, manifested as an increase either in general levels of distress or in the rate of clinically diagnosable states. In recent years, considerable interest has been expressed in the idea that there is more to it than that; that in fact affective disorder-and more specifically depressive disorder-is a specific complication of stroke. The quasi-diagnostic use of the term poststroke depression tends to reinforce belief in this notion of depression associated with stroke as being something special. If depression is indeed a specific complication of stroke, then we should expect to find evidence in one of three spheres. First, perhaps the basic clinical phenomena are different in stroke: there may be specific depressive syndromes not found in other physical disorders, on the rates of depressive disorder may be higher than those found in other illnesses of equivalent severity, or the natural history may be different for any depressive disorder that does exist. Second, whatever the appearance of depression may be, its etiology may be different in stroke. And third, it may be that depression associated with stroke has different characteristics in response to treatment that suggest it is not like depression associated with other physical illnesses.

Hemos apreciado que es util distinguir entre las situaciones que se inician antes de la pubertad de las que se presentan en la etapa postpuberal, ya que se trata de periodos biologicamente distintos, cada uno con su propia vulnerabilidad frente a trastornos psiquiatricos especificos. Debido a que se esta reconociendo de forma creciente que pueden coexistir sintomas psiquiatricos junto con el retraso mental, y que no se encuentran irremisiblemente asociados al trastorno cognitivo, se considera que estas situaciones son tratables, en parte, conforme a un modelo medico. Uno de los objetivos mas huidizos pero fundamentales de la intervencion farmacologica en estos trastornos es mejorar la regulacion fisiologica, la estabilidad emocional y el procesamiento neurocognitivo.",

In recent years, a growing body of literature investigated the association between RLS/WED and Parkinson's Disease (PD). Several questions regarding the comorbidity between these two disorders are still unanswered. If the insurgence of RLS/WED may precede the onset of PD, or if RLS/WED could represent a secondary condition of PD and if impaired dopaminergic pathway may represent a bridge between these two conditions are still debatable issues. In this review, we critically discuss the relationship between RLS/WED and PD by reviewing cross sectional and longitudinal studies, as well as the role of dopamine in these disorders. A twofold interpretation have to be taken into account: dopaminergic therapy may have a crucial role in the development of RLS/WED in PD patients or RLS/WED can be conceived as an early manifestation of PD rather than a risk factor. Several studies showed a high prevalence of RLS/WED in PD patients and several findings related to dopaminergic and iron alterations in both disorders, however up to now it is difficult to find a point of agreement between studies. A greater number of systematic and strongly controlled longitudinal studies as well as basic pathophysiological investigations particularly in RLS/WED are needed to clarify this complex relationship.",

This is in contrast to the early onset form where progression is slow, dementia rare and response to dopamine agonists very good – albeit with high incidence of dyskinesias.

      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a lifelong illness, with symptoms beginning in late adolescence/early adulthood and persisting throughout the rest of the patient's life. Positive psychotic symptoms may fluctuate during the course of the illness, but negative symptoms, especially primary negative symptoms, and cognitive dysfunction are relatively constant. The negative symptoms of schizophrenia are both primary (associated with the illness) and secondary (due to depression, neuroleptic-induced parkinsonism or acute psychosis). While secondary negative symptoms may be reduced by treating the causative agent, primary negative symptoms are viewed as enduring, persisting between psychotic episodes. Conventional antipsychotics treat the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, but they have little effect on primary negative and cognitive symptoms. Primary negative symptoms are often associated with poor premorbid function, the male sex, and low IQ (Intelligence Quotient). In addition, most studies find that negative symptoms are associated with a poor overall outcome. Several studies, including our own, have suggested that primary negative symptoms are functionally localized to the frontal and parietal cortices. These kinds of data raise the possibility that primary negative symptoms may have a pathophysiological basis distinct from positive psychosis. Cognitive impairment also appears to be a relatively independent aspect of schizophrenia. Impairment may be evident in a subtle form from early childhood, and often precedes the development of psychotic symptoms. Additional impairment accrues with the onset of psychotic illness with little evidence, in the vast majority of cases, of progression over the course of the illness. Cognitive impairment is only modestly related to psychotic symptom severity and type. However, the extent, and perhaps specific types of cognitive impairment, appear to be predictive of functional outcome.",

Sleep disturbances in PD are heterogeneous, ranging from insomnia to drug-induced sleep disorders, and now can be assessed by simple validated bedside tools such as the Parkinson’s Disease Sleep Scale (PDSS). Also, sleep, contrary to previous perceptions, can be disordered not just in advanced PD, but also in the pre-motor as well as the untreated states.",

The treatment of Parkinson's disease remains symptomatic but allows, for many years, a good control of motor and non-motor signs. This treatment is complex and has to deal with very heterogeneous motor and non-motor presentation. Initial treatment is started once disability occurs and is mainly based either on levodopa or dopamine agonists. When motor fluctuations start, the principle of treatment is to optimize levodopa intake and combine various drugs depending on the clinical presentation. Third line strategies of treatment such as pumps or deep brain stimulation may be proposed at this stage. Later on, when doparesistant signs appear, treatment has often to be simplified, cognitive decline to be taken in charge and physiotherapy is crucial even if physical exercise is of great importance whatever the stage of the disease. Finally, non-motor manifestations have to be carefully addressed throughout the course of the disease because their impact on quality of life is sometimes greater than the one of motor signs.Prise en charge de la maladie de parkinson : de la lune de miel aux fluctuations Le traitement de la maladie de Parkinson reste à ce jour symptomatique mais permet le contrôle des signes moteurs et non moteurs de la maladie pendant de nombreuses années. Il est complexe du fait de la variété des signes à la fois moteurs et non moteurs. Le traitement initial est décidé lorsqu’une gêne apparaît, et la discussion principale est celle du choix entre L-dopa et agonistes dopaminergiques. Au stade des fluctuations motrices, les options sont nombreuses et reposent sur l’optimisation de la dopathérapie et la combinaison avec d’autres traitements selon les manifestations observées. Les thérapies de recours telles que les pompes ou la stimulation cérébrale profonde peuvent être proposées à ce stade. La phase de déclin se caractérise par la présence de signes dopa-résistants et, à ce stade, il est souvent nécessaire de simplifier le traitement, de prendre en charge le déclin cognitif et de renforcer la physiothérapie. L’exercice physique est important à tous les stades, de même que la prise en compte des troubles neuropsychiques liés à la maladie ou induits par les traitements car ils contribuent dans une grande mesure à la détérioration de la qualité de vie des patients.",

Although this phenomenon is widely observed and has a major impact on the patients’ condition, the knowledge about the underlying mechanisms behind is still sparse. Possible explanations encompass changes in the pharmacodynamics of the dopaminergic drugs, altered dopamine metabolism in the brain, alterations in the dopaminergic transmission in the striatum or an enhancement of neurodegeneration due to remote effects of peripheral inflammatory processes or circulating bacterial toxins.

      "abstract": "This chapter focuses on the following non-parkinsonian movement disorders affecting the elderly: myoclonus, tremor, dystonia, tardive dyskinesia, chorea, functional movement disorders, and restless legs and periodic limb movements during sleep and while awake. These are mostly clinical diagnoses, and a through history and neurologic examination are crucial to establish the correct diagnosis. Non-parkinsonian movement disorders in the elderly population are secondary phenomena, especially due to medication side effects and metabolic or hematologic conditions. It is therefore important to check for any potential underlying causes when evaluation a patient with new onset non-parkinsonian movement disorders for the first time. Treatment modalities are mainly symptomatic. They should be initiated and adjusted based on the patient's subjective level of discomfort.",

Patients suffering from delirium experience an acute change in mental status, fluctuating levels of consciousness, and an inability to acquire new information. Patients with major neurocognitive disorder experience significant cognitive decline in complex attention, executive function, learning and memory, language, perceptual-motor, and social cognition. The chapter also discusses mental disorders due to another medical condition. These patients can experience psychotic, mood, or anxious symptoms or a personality change; their intellectual functioning usually remains intact. A patient presenting with a first episode of psychiatric symptoms and no prior psychiatric history should be evaluated for an acute medical etiology causing the psychiatric symptoms, particularly if he or she is over 40 years of age. Anticholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, galantamine, and rivastigmine) may slow the rate of cognitive decline in Alzheimer’s disease, and the combination of an anticholinesterase inhibitor and memantine may be more effective than either medication alone.",

If the patient has parkinsonism, the first priority is to determine whether there is a reversible cause, most commonly a medication. If the patient has parkinsonism not due to a reversible cause, consider pharmacological treatment with carbidopa–levodopa or a dopamine agonist. Also refer to physical therapy for balance training and education on how to reduce fall risk. Importantly, multiple concussion-related parkinsonism is not the same as Parkinson’s disease.

Nonmotor features of PD, such as dementia, may be an intrinsic feature of the disorder and persist regardless of the medication on or off state ; some of the nonmotor features, such as psychotic symptoms, may be difficult complications of pharmacologic intervention for the treatment of the motor manifestations of PD. Difficult complications, such as psychosis and impulse control disorders, may respond to modify of the PD treatment regimen at the risk of worsening motor symptoms. Thus, a balance must be required between controlling nonmotor manifestations and motor features of the disease . although the definition of Parkinson disease (PD) is based on the presence of motor features .Nonmotor manifestations are nearly related in PD, with behavior problems often being the most malignant. Almost all patients with PD have nonmotor and neuropsychiatric features, including sleep disturbances, compulsive and impulsive behaviors, autonomic dysfunction, and psychosis. The neuropsychiatric and behavioral features of PD can be classified as intrinsic features, which occur as part of PD, and iatrogenic features, which are complications that arise from treatments used to manage the motor symptoms of PD.",

EPS occur mainly at the final stages of many dementia forms and can be associated to a more deleterious outcome, shorter survival, more rapid rate of cognitive and functional decline. We will review after the epidemiology, clinical aspects, underlying mechanisms and treatment of dementia in PD. Dementia is highly prevalent in Parkinson's disease. The prototype of dementia in PD is a dysexecutive syndrome with impaired attention, executive functions and secondarily impaired memory. Neurochemically the most significant deficit seems to be cholinergic; dementia seems to correlate best with cortical and limbic Lewy bodies.

Unfortunately, all too often PD patients spend their nights in misery. It may be difficult for some of them to turn or get out of bed, and many awaken frequently to urinate. Others may drool excessively, experience leg restlessness or pains, and still others are bothered frequently by disturbing nightmares. Some patients spend hours walking around or sitting in a chair, and caregivers describe episodes of nocturnal confusion.

Apart from these, various nonmotor symptoms (NMS) also occur in PD and constitute a major clinical challenge, as they are common, but often overshadowed by the dominance of motor symptoms. NMS can present at any stage of the disease including early and pre-motor phase of PD. Several NMS such as olfactory dysfunction, constipation, REM behaviour disorder, depression may antedate the motor signs, symptoms and diagnosis of PD by a number of years. Since, NMS add significantly to the overall disability caused by PD, their early recognition and treatment may go a long way in improving the quality of life of PD patients as well as the economic burden on the carers. The identification of NMS can be improved by the application of quantitative and validated instruments and scales for their assessment.",

      "abstract": "Therapeutic options for Parkinson's disease (PD) are currently limited to symptomatic agents. Levodopa is the most efficacious treatment; however, higher doses and long-term use are associated with adverse effects such as motor fluctuations and dyskinesia. Early treatment of PD with other agents such as dopamine agonists and monoamine oxidase type B inhibitors can provide symptomatic benefit and delay initiation of levodopa therapy. Early treatment of PD is contingent upon early and accurate diagnosis of the disease, which can be challenging because there are no biomarkers or neuroimaging or other clinical tests available to confirm the diagnosis. PD diagnosis is currently based on the presence or absence of various clinical features and the experience of the treating physician. A definitive diagnosis can be made only after autopsy. Moreover, the signs and symptoms present in early PD can resemble those of a number of other movement disorders, particularly other forms of parkinsonism, such as multiple system atrophy, drug-induced parkinsonism, and vascular parkinsonism, as well as diffuse Lewy body disease and essential tremor. Nevertheless, diagnosis of PD based on clinical features and response to antiparkinsonian medication can be achieved with a fairly high level of accuracy, particularly when made by a physician specializing in movement disorders. This article reviews and summarizes published recommendations for the clinical diagnosis of PD.",

Diseases of the central nervous system (CNS) in particular may profoundly affect sleep initiation and maintenance by disrupting the structural and neurochemical substrates that regulate sleep. Medical conditions can lead to chronic insomnia in several ways. They may cause unpleasant stimuli, which in turn disrupt sleep continuity. They may produce changes in systemic physiology that are vital to sleep continuity (as with disorders of ventilation), or they may produce humoral changes that favor awakening (as in thyroid or adrenal disease). The incidence of insomnia increases with age as medical problems increasingly occur (1), and patients with chronic insomnia are more likely to develop adverse health outcomes due to medical disease(2). The effects of acute and subacute sleep disruption can lead to psycho-physiological insomnia by creating the anticipation of disturbed sleep and altering circadian rhythms, further accentuating the disruptive effects of the underlying medical condition. Difficulties with insomnia may persist long after the causative medical condition has been effectively managed.",

      "abstract": "La maladie de Parkinson est une affection neurodegenerative principalement associee a la degenerescence progressive des neurones dopaminergiques du mesencephale provoquant un dysfonctionnement des noyaux gris centraux. En parallele de symptomes moteurs bien connus, cette affection entraine egalement l’emergence de deficits emotionnels impactant en outre l’expression et la reconnaissance des emotions. Ici, se pose la question d’un deficit de reconnaissance des emotions faciales chez les patients parkinsoniens lie au moins en partie aux troubles moteurs. En effet, selon les theories de simulation des emotions, copier les emotions de l’autre nous permettrait de mieux les reconnaitre. Ce serait le role du mimetisme facial. Automatique et inconscient, ce phenomene est caracterise par des reactions musculaires congruentes a l’emotion exprimee par autrui. Dans ce contexte, une perturbation des capacites motrices pourrait conduire a une alteration des capacites de reconnaissance des emotions. Or, l’un des symptomes moteurs les plus frequents dans la maladie de Parkinson, l’amimie faciale, consiste en une perte de la mobilite des muscles du visage. Ainsi, nous avons examine l’efficience du mimetisme facial dans la maladie de Parkinson, son influence sur la qualite du processus de reconnaissance des emotions, ainsi que l’effet du traitement dopaminergique antiparkinsonien sur ces processus. Pour cela, nous avons developpe un paradigme permettant l’evaluation simultanee des capacites de reconnaissance et de mimetisme (corrugator supercilii, zygomaticus major et orbicularis oculi) d’emotions exprimees sur des visages dynamiques (joie, colere, neutre). Cette experience a ete proposee a un groupe de patients parkinsoniens compare a un groupe de sujets sains temoins. Nos resultats supportent l’hypothese selon laquelle le deficit de reconnaissance des emotions chez le patient parkinsonien pourrait resulter d’un systeme « bruite » au sein duquel le mimetisme facial participerait. Cependant, l’alteration du mimetisme facial dans la maladie de Parkinson et son influence sur la reconnaissance des emotions dependraient des muscles impliques dans l’expression a reconnaitre. En effet, ce serait davantage le relâchement du corrugateur plutot que les contractions du zygomatique ou de l’orbiculaire de l’œil qui nous aiderait a bien reconnaitre les expressions de joie. D’un autre cote, rien ne nous permet ici de confirmer l’influence du mimetisme facial sur la reconnaissance des expressions de colere. Enfin, nous avons propose cette experience a des patients en condition de traitement habituel et apres une interruption temporaire de traitement. Les resultats preliminaires de cette etude apportent des elements en faveur d’un effet benefique du traitement dopaminergique tant sur la reconnaissance des emotions que sur les capacites de mimetisme. L’hypothese d’un effet benefique dit « peripherique » sur la reconnaissance des emotions par restauration du mimetisme facial reste a tester a ce jour. Nous discutons l’ensemble de ces resultats selon les conceptions recentes sur le role des noyaux gris centraux et sous l’angle de l’hypothese de feedback facial.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is characterised not only by the classic triad of bradykinesia, rigidity and tremor, but also by the frequent occurrence of various non-motor symptoms such as the impulse control disorders (pathological gambling, hypersexuality, compulsive buying, binge eating, punding and dopamine dependency).To increase insight into the clinical presentation, risk factors, treatment and the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of impulse control disorders in Parkinson's disease.Relevant literature was reviewed.Impulse control disorders belong to an important group of neuropsychiatric disorders that occur at some point in 5-10% of patients with Parkinson's disease. They generally occur in conjunction with dopaminergic medication and can have a marked social, relational and/ or financial impact.Early recognition of impulse control disorders in Parkinson's disease is important and a close collaboration between the neurologist and the psychiatrist is essential in order to ensure correct diagnosis and the best possible treatment. Impulse control disorders in Parkinson's disease show considerable phenomenological overlap with other repetitive behaviours within the impulsive-compulsive spectrum of disorders to which the obsessive-compulsive disorders and addiction disorders belong. The overlap can possibly be explained by a shared pathophysiological mechanism involving an imbalance between the direct and indirect pathways of the dorsal and ventral frontal-striatal circuits.",

First, Is trauma a true cause of insanity, i. e., can an injury alone, acting on a normal man of healthy ancestry who is not suffering from cerebral arterial disease, syphilis, alcoholism or any other disease which affects the brain or who has not been broken down by the mere stress of life, cause insanity, or is the trauma a mere exciting cause, a provocative agent, which acting on a man already predisposed and ready to become insane gives him an opportunity so to do? Second, Does any characteristic type of insanity follow trauma? From the mental symptoms alone, while ignorant of the history of an injury, is it possible in any given case to know that a man is insane because he has received a trauma?

However, in a number of patients, symptoms persist or may even worsen over time, suggesting the development of concomitant Parkinson's disease. The prevalence estimates of Parkinson's disease after neuroleptic exposure are unexpectedly high, suggesting a causal relationship. We critically review available literature in this regard, and some pathophysiological hypotheses that might explain such a relationship are suggested. Some patients may have an undetermined genetic susceptibility to parkinsonism. We speculate that the possible neurotoxic effect of neuroleptics exerted on a susceptible dopaminergic system would lead over the long-term to a self-fostering, progressive process.

It is characterized clinically by its cardinal motor features: bradykinesia, rigidity, postural instability, and resting tremor. The clinical diagnosis of PD is mainly based on the presence of these motor symptoms which differentiate it from the other forms of parkinsonism. However, recently other symptoms known as non-motor symptoms (NMS) are ginning attention because of their negative outcome on PD patients, and they are now included in the clinical diagnosis of the disease. Current lines treatments are generally based on DA replacement and are associated with significant alleviation of motor symptoms and some NMS. However, such treatments have not been shown to decrease or halt the disease progression. Moreover, as the disease progresses, these symptomatic treatments can worsen the disease diagnosis and management.",

      "title": "Distrofias musculares congénitas",
      "abstract": "Las distrofias musculares congénitas (DMC) son enfermedades musculares hereditarias muy heterogéneas. Su diagnóstico se basa en criterios histológicos (signos distróficos en músculo) y clínicos (de inicio neonatal o durante la infancia precoz, antes de adquirir la marcha). Los lactantes presentan hipotonía, movilidad disminuida y retraso o estancamiento del desarrollo motor. Son enfermedades progresivas, con frecuente aparición de retracciones articulares, rigidez y deformidad de columna, insuficiencia respiratoria y, en algunas formas, afectación cardiaca. Por ello, necesitan un manejo multidisciplinario neuro-ortopédico, cardio-respiratorio y frecuentemente quirúrgico. Los valores de las enzimas musculares (CK) permiten orientar el diagnóstico. Formas con aumento marcado de CK guían hacia la DMC con déficit de merosina (gen LAMA2) y las distroglicanopatías, muy heterogéneas genéticamente. Ambas pueden asociar anomalías cerebrales y retraso mental (frecuente en las distroglicanopatías), o limitarse a la sustancia blanca cerebral, sin deterioro cognitivo (merosinopatías). La biopsia muscular ayuda en el diagnóstico detectando el déficit de merosina o la glicosilación anómala de distroglicano. Las formas de DMC sin aumento importante de CK no presentan afectación cerebral y se diagnostican frecuentemente gracias a la identificación de signos clínicos como hiperlaxitud distal en la DMC de Ullrich (genes COL6), rigidez espinal selectiva y fallo respiratorio en las selenopatías (gen SEPN1) o “drop-head” en las laminopatías (gen LMNA). La resonancia magnética muscular es muy útil para confirmar la sospecha clínica y orientar casos difíciles. La identificación genética y el desarrollo de modelos animales están ayudando a conocer mejor la fisiopatología de estas enfermedades, aumentando las posibilidades de encontrar terapias para el futuro. Congenital muscular dystrophies (CMDs) are inherited muscle disorders with a high clinical and genetic heterogeneity. Diagnostic criteria are histological (dystrophy in muscle biopsy) and clinical (onset at birth or before the age of walking). Affected infants typically appear “floppy” with low muscle tone and poor spontaneous movements. Patients may present with delay or arrest of gross motor development. CMDs show progressive weakness, joint contractures, spinal stiffness and deformities, respiratory compromise and certain types may develop cardiac symptoms. Multidisciplinary management is required, including neuro-orthopedic, cardio-respiratory and often surgical treatment. Dosage of muscle enzymes (CK) helps in the diagnostic pathway. Marked increase is observed in merosin deficient CMD (LAMA2 gene) and in the dystroglycanopathies, which are genetically very heterogeneous. Both disorders may show central nervous system abnormalities, being often associated with mental retardation in dystroglycanopathies, while merosinopathies show only striking white matter changes and intellect is not impaired. Muscle biopsy helps to detect defects in merosin expression or abnormal dystroglycane glycosylation. CMDs without marked increase of CK do not associate brain involvement. Diagnosis is often oriented by the identification of clinical markers such as distal hyperlaxity in Ullrich CMD (COL6 genes), selective spinal rigidity and respiratory failure in selenopathies (SEPN1 gene), or dropped head in laminopathies (LMNA gene). Muscle MRI is very useful to confirm clinical suspicion and orientate difficult cases. Gene identification in these disorders and development of animal models are helping to better understand their physiopathologic mechanisms, opening the possibility for future therapies.",

      "abstract": "Although routine clinical neurological examination generally does not reveal any abnormality of sensation in persons with Parkinson's disease (PD), subjective sensory symptoms are quite frequently present, and objective abnormalities of proprioceptive function and sensorimotor integration have been demonstrated with sophisticated testing. Primary sensory symptoms of PD may include paresthesias of varied descriptions (numbness, tingling, and burning). Painful symptoms in PD can be classified into five categories: musculoskeletal pain, radicular or neuropathic pain, dystonia-related pain, primary (central) pain, and akathitic discomfort. Musculoskeletal pain in the form of shoulder stiffness frequently develops in persons with PD, often preceding the development of more classic motor features of the condition. Spinal deformities and painful contractures may also complicate the clinical picture in individuals with PD. The postural PD deformities may predispose to the development of compressive radiculopathy and sciatica. Dystonic spasms are among the most painful symptoms that a patient with PD may experience. Dystonia most often appears as an \" off\" phenomenon, but medication-induced dystonia may also occur. Primary or central pain is generated within the brain itself and is commonly characterized by bizarre, disagreeable painful sensations that are resistant to treatment. Parkinsonian akathisia is characterized by subjective inner restlessness that manifests as a constant need to move or change position, typically during \"off\" periods. The recognition and differentiation of parkinsonian pain from pain owing to other coincident medical conditions is vitally important for the effective diagnosis and treatment of pain in PD.",

Melly, SST, M.Kes.\r\n\r\nDiabetes Mellitus adalah suatu keadaan dimana tubuh bisa menghasilkan hormon insulin sesuai kebutuhan atau tubuh tidak bisa memanfaatkan secara optimal insulin yang dihasilkan, sehingga terjadi lonjakan kadar gula dalam darah melebihi normal. Pada penderita diabetes mellitus terutama yang sudah bersifat kronik dapat terjadi gangguan atau komplikasi berupa neuropati diabetik, protein uria, kelainan koroner. Pada kerusakan sistem saraf dibagi tiga kelompok yaitu kerusakan sistem saraf perifer, kerusakan saraf otonom, kerusakan saraf motorik. Kerusakan sistem saraf perifer pada umumnya dapat menyebabkan kesemutan, nyeri pada tangan dan kaki, serta berkurangnya sensitifitas atau mati rasa. Sehingga penderita diabetes mellitus lebih tinggi resikonya mengalami masalah kaki yaitu sirkulasi darah kaki ke tungkai yang menurun, berkurangnya perasaan pada kaki, berkurangnya daya tahan tubuh terhadap infeksi. Pada umumnya penderita diabetes mellitus terlambat untuk menyadari bahwa terjadi luka pada kakinya disebabkan gangguan sirkulasi pembuluh darah yang menyebabkan luka tersebut sukar untuk sembuh dan akan menjadi ulkus atau gangren. Tujuan dari penulisan ini adalah mahasiswa mampu memberi asuhan keperawatan secara komprehensif dengan metode kasus yang dilakukan terhadap Ny. J pada tanggal 30 Maret sampai 01 April 2020. Hasil studi kasus ini menyebutkan bahwa Ny. J mengalami diabetes mellitus tipe 2 dengan ulkus diabetik dengan empat masalah keperawtan yaitu nyeri, hambatan mobilitas fisik, kerusakan integritas kulit, resiko infeksi.

      "title": "Neurological Deterioration in Wilson's Disease—Types, Etiology, Course, and Management",
      "abstract": "Wilson's disease (WD) is an inherited disorder of copper metabolism in which pathological copper accumulation, mainly in the liver and the brain, leads to hepatic and/or neuropsychiatric signs and symptoms. Chelators and zinc salts can successfully induce negative copper balance in many patients; however, neurological deterioration may still be observed. This phenomenon can be divided into: (1) early `paradoxical' neurological deterioration, which usually develops in the first 6 months of anti-copper treatment and may be commonly related to drug type, or (2) late neurological deterioration, which mostly occurs after 6 months of treatment and is often related either to non-compliance with treatment, overtreatment resulting in copper deficiency, or adverse drug reactions. Another explanation, especially for early neurological deterioration, is natural WD progression, which can be difficult to differentiate from drug-related deterioration, but usually leads to a worse outcome. There is still no consensus on how to define neurological deterioration in WD using scales or biomarkers, how to distinguish it from the natural disease progression, its risk factors, and optimal management. This narrative review, based on the current literature, aims to provide definitions, prevalence, pathological mechanisms and factors related to neurological deterioration, and also proposes schemes for diagnosis and treatment.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Neurometabolic diseases are a group of disorders that lead to a disruption in the normal metabolism within the body and nervous system. Abnormalities of metabolic processes at any level can lead to a wide spectrum of clinical features and pathologies. The nervous system is particularly susceptible to metabolic derangements, either inborn or acquired. Early diagnosis can prevent or delay damage to the nervous system through appropriate treatment when possible. Many neurometabolic disorders have poor prognoses, and patients often present and succumb within months to the early years of life; however, some disorders can present later in life with varying levels of severity. In many later onset cases, the diagnosis is preceded by nonspecific symptoms including psychiatric manifestations. In addition to psychiatric manifestations, various neurological features often occur at some point in the course of the disease. Of these features, movement disorders are particularly common. In fact, many neurometabolic diseases will present with subtle movement disorders that are often missed or overlooked. Many congenital metabolic diseases are rapidly neurodegenerative and, due to the nature of such diseases, result in early demise or severe cognitive decline. While by no means exhaustive, this chapter aims to outline and discuss some of the neurometabolic diseases that present with both psychiatric and movement disorders as prominent features.",

Os sintomas motores caracteristicos sao: tremor de repouso, bradicinesia, rigidez e instabilidade postural que ocorre em fases mais tardias da doenca. A progressao dos sintomas determina o nivel de incapacidade motora no individuo com DP e e, tambem, associada a deficits perifericos como perda progressiva de massa muscular, diminuicao da forca muscular e da resistencia e deterioracao da aptidao fisica. Alteracoes da forca muscular em fase avancada da DP e um achado comum e incapacitante para o individuo. Porem, mesmo na fase inicial, individuos com DP poderiam apresentar perda de forca muscular. A literatura tem apontado deficits de torque e forca muscular em diferentes estagios da DP com diferencas entre os membros mais e menos comprometidos pela sintomatologia parkinsoniana. Entretanto, os resultados sao controversos em relacao a presenca dessa assimetria na fase inicial da doenca. Tem sido sugerido que individuos com DP apresentam um deficit na ativacao dos musculos extensores o que contribuiria para a postura clinicamente observada na fase avancada da DP. Alguns estudos sugeriram que tal deficit poderia estar presente desde a fase inicial da doenca. O objetivo do presente estudo foi comparar as medidas de desempenho muscular de flexores e extensores do tronco, quadril, joelho e tornozelo entre individuos na fase inicial da DP e individuos sem a doenca, comparar as medidas de desempenho muscular de flexores e extensores do quadril, joelho e tornozelo entre os membros inferiores mais e menos comprometidos dos individuos na fase inicial da DP e comparar as medidas de desempenho muscular entre flexores e extensores do tronco, quadril, joelho e tornozelo dos individuos na fase inicial da DP. Participaram do presente estudo 20 individuos acima de 50 anos divididos em 2 grupos: um experimental composto por 10 individuos com DP na fase inicial e o outro controle, com 10 individuos sem DP, pareados por idade, nivel de atividade fisica, sexo, altura e peso. O dinamometro isocinetico Biodex System 3 Pro® (Biodex Medical Systems Inc., Shirley, NY, USA) foi utilizado para a avaliacao do desempenho muscular dos flexores e extensores de quadris, joelhos, tornozelos e tronco dos individuos com e sem DP. As variaveis avaliadas neste estudo foram trabalho maximo e potencia media normalizados pelo peso corporal e a relacao agonista/antagonista nas velocidades angulares de 30o/s (lenta) e 90o/s (rapida), no modo concentrico-concentrico, para os membros inferiores e de 120o/s para o tronco. A analise dos dados foi feita atraves do programa SPSS (versao 15.0 para Windows) e analises de variância (ANOVA) mista para medidas repetidas com dois niveis fatoriais. Os individuos na fase inicial da DP do presente estudo apresentaram um desempenho muscular significativamente inferior nos membros inferiores e tronco quando comparados a individuos sem a doenca. O grupo com DP mostrou pior performance muscular, principalmente da musculatura axial e proximal do corpo, em relacao aos musculos distais. Observou-se, tambem, um pior desempenho do membro inferior nao dominante no grupo controle e do membro mais afetado no grupo com DP, principalmente na velocidade mais alta. A variavel razao agonista/antagonista nao demonstrou diferenca significativa entre os grupos e membros inferiores em nenhum dos grupos musculares testados. Os individuos na fase inicial da DP do presente estudo apresentaram pior desempenho muscular nos membros inferiores e tronco quando comparados a individuos sem doenca. Os resultados indicaram ainda que os musculos flexores e extensores das regioes axial e proximal do corpo podem ser afetados mais precocemente pela DP em relacao a musculatura distal. Alem disso, os grupos apresentaram um desempenho muscular assimetrico entre os membros inferiores.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized typically by motor features of tremor, rigidity and bradykinesia due to depletion of dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurons. PD is increasingly recognized as a non-motor disorder since symptoms such as dementia, depression and falls emerge with disease progression to become dominant in the clinical picture. PD results in a significant decline in quality of life for both patients and family and contributes to significant economic and institutional costs on family and society. PD is uncommon before the age of 40 but affects approximately 1% of patients over the age of 60, with a rising incidence and prevalence thereafter to around 2% in the population over 80 years of age.",

      "abstract": "Sleep-related movement disorders are generally characterized by simple movements that disturb sleep or the ability to fall asleep. These disorders manifest symptoms of nocturnal sleep disturbance and daytime sleepiness or tiredness. In order to make an accurate diagnosis, an all-night video recording is desired to differentiate these disorders from parasomnias. Sleep-related movement disorders or congenital simple movements can cause disturbed sleep. All-night recordings are recommended to differentiate the sleep-related movement disorder from parasomnias. Patients are usually unaware of movements or sleep disturbance. Sleep-related rhythmic movement disorders are repetitive and stereotyped with rhythmic motor behaviors. These movements occur during drowsiness or early sleep and involve large muscle groups and include body rocking, head rolling, or head banging. They are more common in children and infants. In most situations, they do not have any significant consequences. Many sleep-related movement disorders are a result of a medical condition due to side effects or withdrawal from medication or a substance, or they could be an isolated symptom or normal variant. Many of these disorders of movement tend to overlap with other sleep conditions including parasomnias. In general, parasomnias are undesirable physical events that occur when falling asleep, during sleep, or while waking up. They include abnormal sleep-related complex movements, behaviors, and autonomic nervous system activity. They significantly contrast with sleep-related movement disorders. Parasomnias tend to result in injuries, sleep disruption, and adverse health effects. Sometimes they affect the patient, the bed partner, or both. Non-REM-related parasomnias include confused arousals, sleepwalking, and sleep terrors. Patients tend to have a partial or complete amnesia for episodes. REM-related parasomnias include a REM behavior disorder also known as RBD. It predominantly occurs in middle-aged to elderly males. However, it is often associated with an underlying neurologic disorder such as Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy, narcolepsy, cerebrovascular accident, or Lewy body dementia. Nightmare disorder is apparent during rapid eye movement sleep and often leads to awakening with a bowel movement. While prevalent in the general population, this is common in children. Nightmares are frequently associated with psychopathology such as posttraumatic stress disorder. The patient remembers the dreams and can describe the nightmare, which usually involves threats to survival, security, or physical activity. Nightmares can have a negative impact on family functioning and lead to daytime sleepiness, fatigue, or low energy. It can also impair occupational or educational functions.",

      "title": "What causes mental dysfunction in Parkinson's disease?",
      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is frequently associated with mental dysfunction. Domain-specific cognitive deficits are ubiquitous, and although they may not be clinically apparent in all patients, they are demonstrable by neuropsychological testing. Dementia is less frequent but is present significantly more in PD patients than in controls, with a cumulative prevalence rate up to 40% and up to six-fold increased incidence. Cognitive impairment mainly involves executive and visuospatial functions; memory is secondarily impaired with relatively preserved recognition. Qualitatively, the neuropsychological profile of dementia encompasses the same type of deficits found in nondemented PD patients. The dementia seen in PD, therefore, can be described as a dysexecutive syndrome combined with visuospatial dysfunction and behavioural symptoms. Dopaminergic, noradrenergic, serotoninergic, and cholinergic deficits have all been described as the underlying neurochemical impairment, but the strongest evidence exists for a cholinergic dysfunction. Involvement of brainstem nuclei, limbic structures, and cerebral cortex have been suggested as the site, and Lewy body (LB) degeneration and Alzheimer-type changes as the type of pathology underlying the mental dysfunction in PD. Although there is still some controversy as to the site and type of pathology, recent evidence suggests that LB-type degeneration in limbic structures and cerebral cortex, with consequent synaptic and cell loss, is the main pathological state associated with dementia in PD. © 2003 Movement Disorder Society",

      "abstract": "Dementia and Parkinson's disease are incurable neurological conditions. Patients often experience specific, complex, and varying needs along their disease trajectory. Current management typically employs a multidisciplinary team approach. Recognition is growing that this team approach should also address palliative care issues to optimize quality of life for patient and family caregivers, but it remains unclear how palliative care is best delivered. To inspire future service development and research, we compare the trajectories and conceptualization of palliative care between dementia and Parkinson's disease. Both Parkinson's disease and dementia are characterized by a protracted course, with progressive but fairly insidious development of disability. However, patients with Parkinson's disease may experience relatively stable periods initially but with time, a wide range of debilitating symptoms develops, many of which do not respond well to treatment. Eventually, dementia develops in most Parkinson patients, while motor disability develops in many dementia patients. In both diseases, symptoms such as pain, apathy, sleeping problems, falls, and a high caregiver burden are prevalent. Advance care planning has benefits in terms of being prepared before the disease progresses into a stage with communication problems or severe cognitive impairment. However, for both conditions, the protracted disease trajectories complicate conceptualization of palliative care through different stages of the disease, with pertinent questions such as when to offer what interventions pro-actively. Given the similarities and differences, we should develop palliative approaches that are partially generic and partially disease-specific. These should be integrated seamlessly with disease-specific care. Substantial research is already being performed on dementia palliative care. This may also inform the further development of palliative care for Parkinson's disease, including an evaluation of palliative interventions and services.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease (PD) ranks as the second-most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder that afflicts the aging population (1). Hallmark neuropathological features of PD consist of dopaminergic cell loss in the substantia nigra, striatal dopamine deficiency, and formation of intracellular inclusions, called Lewy bodies, marked by α-synuclein aggregates (2). Although the primary brain deficiency of PD involves nigrostriatal dopaminergic depletion, various cell types undergo degeneration in the brain, as well as in the periphery during disease onset and progression (3). The clinical symptoms of PD have been routinely defined as cardinal motor abnormalities, which include bradykinesia, tremors, muscle rigidity, and freezing of gait (1). However, PD is also associated with many nonmotor symptoms, such as cognitive deficits, that contribute to overall morbidity of the disease (1, 4). In addition to α-synuclein accumulation, several mechanisms postulated to mediate dopaminergic depletion comprise mitochondrial dysfunction, aberrant oxidative stress, calcium imbalance, impaired axonal transport, and neuroinflammation (1). The advent of disease biomarkers may facilitate early diagnosis and treatment initiation for PD. Unfortunately, despite these scientific advances in our knowledge of the disease pathology, there is no cure for PD, only relief from its symptoms. While dopaminergic cells are selectively destroyed in PD patients, what triggers this brain cell death remains poorly understood, thereby relegating treatment intervention to … \n\n[↵][1]1Email: cborlong{at}health.usf.edu.\n\n [1]: #xref-corresp-1-1",

      "abstract": "The term dysautonomia refers to a change in autonomic nervous system function that adversely affects health. The changes range from transient, occasional episodes of neurally mediated hypotension to progressive neurodegenerative diseases; from disorders in which altered autonomic function plays a primary pathophysiologic role to disorders in which it worsens an independent pathologic state; and from mechanistically straightforward to mysterious and controversial entities. In chronic autonomic failure (pure autonomic failure, multiple system atrophy, or autonomic failure in Parkinson disease), orthostatic hypotension reflects sympathetic neurocirculatory failure from sympathetic denervation or deranged reflexive regulation of sympathetic outflows. Chronic orthostatic intolerance associated with postural tachycardia can arise from cardiac sympathetic activation after “patchy” autonomic impairment or blood volume depletion or, as highlighted in this discussion, from a primary abnormality that augments delivery of the sympathetic neurotransmitter norepinephrine to its receptors in the heart. Increased sympathetic nerve traffic to the heart and kidneys seems to occur as essential hypertension develops. Acute panic can evoke coronary spasm that is associated with sympathoneural and adrenomedullary excitation. In congestive heart failure, compensatory cardiac sympathetic activation may chronically worsen myocardial function, which rationalizes treatment with β-adrenoceptor blockers. A high frequency of positive results on tilt-table testing has confirmed an association between the chronic fatigue syndrome and orthostatic intolerance; however, treatment with the salt-retaining steroid fludrocortisone, which is usually beneficial in primary chronic autonomic failure, does not seem to be beneficial in the chronic fatigue syndrome. Dysautonomias are an important subject in clinical neurocardiology.",

      "abstract": "Pediatric neurodegenerative disorders encompass a wide range of conditions that result from progressive damage to cells and nervous system connections that are essential for mobility, coordination, strength, sensation, and cognition. Neurodegenerative diseases affect millions of people worldwide. Neurological disorders are disorders that involve the brain, spinal cord or nerve and muscle. Children with neurological disorders may have disorders such as epilepsy, developmental delay, cerebral palsy, meningitis, genetic/metabolic diseases or diseases of muscle or nerve such as muscular dystrophy or peripheral neuropathy. These illnesses are frequently severe and potentially have long lasting consequences for the affected children. The pathologies most frequently responsible for psycho-physical disorders can be summarized into three groups: collaboration difficulties (autism spectrum disorders, intellectual impairment, phobia); motor dysfunction (cerebral palsy, epilepsy, other brain pathologies, neuromuscular disorders), and craniofacial anomalies (Down syndrome, other genetic syndromes). Due to their clinical history, and the lack of collaboration, in pediatric non-cooperative patients with Special Needs (SN), the anesthesiological risk may result difficult to assess, despite the fact that they meet the criteria of the outpatient management applied for the patient without disabilities. The perioperative management of pediatric patients with psycho-physical disorders with related relational and cognitive problems must be carefully planned, in order to make the entire hospitalization process as comfortable and as less traumatic as possible. General anesthesia is the most suitable type of anesthesia in pediatric patients with Special Needs (SN), although anesthetic complications are more frequent in these patients, mainly due to comorbidities, taken drugs and anatomical peculiarities. Some studies observed no correlation between multiple anesthesia exposures and neurodevelopmental deficits, while others reported that even a single exposure could increase the risk of deficits. An increased risk of developmental or behavioral disorders as the consequence of surgeries requiring general anesthesia was observed. Based on current studies, it is necessary to endeavor to limit the duration and numbers of anesthesia and the dose of anesthetic agents. The evaluation must include history and physical examination pertaining to the conditions requiring special anaesthetic considerations. Early diagnosis and intervention are crucial in managing these neurological disorders in pediatric patients to improve overall quality of life and long-term outcomes.",

Notable among these is REM sleep behavior disorder, which is closely linked to neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson disease. Early detection of this disorder is essential because it often precedes the motor symptoms of neurodegenerative conditions. Diagnostic evaluation of parasomnias typically involves polysomnography, in some cases with video monitoring, to differentiate parasomnias from other conditions. Nonpharmacologic treatments, including sleep hygiene and sleep safety measures, are first-line approaches. Cognitive behavior therapy is also effective. Pharmacotherapy may be required in severe cases. Referral to a sleep specialist is recommended for patients with complex or dangerous parasomnias and for patients with frequent sleep paralysis.",

Age is the most consistent risk factor and incidence in the general population over 75 years of age is 254:100 000.1With an aging population the management of Parkinson's disease is likely to prove an increasingly important and challenging aspect of medical practice. Classically Parkinson's disease presents with resting tremor, rigidity, and akinesia often in an asymmetric fashion, but later usually bilateral. However, initial symptoms may be subtle and vague, for example discomfort or mild stiffness in the limbs, and may be misinterpreted. Moreover clinical features are variable with some patients presenting with akinesia and rigidity only and others with a tremor dominant type. About 10%–20% of autopsy cases with a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease were not considered to suffer from it in life.2 On the other hand, approximately 25% of patients with a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease in life are shown to have a different diagnosis when postmortem examination is carried out.3 4 Diagnosis may thus be difficult particularly as there are no biological markers that unequivocally confirm the diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. The most common differential diagnoses are essential tremor, arteriosclerotic pseudoparkinsonism, drug induced parkinsonism,5 and the so-called Parkinson plus syndromes namely multiple system atrophy,6 7progressive supranuclear palsy,8 9 and corticobasal degeneration.10 \n\nIn the following sections a summary of drugs currently in use in the UK will be provided.

This paper describes how to diagnose Parkinson's disease and the various motor complications and gives recommendations on how to treat the symptoms in these patients. Material and methods The paper builds on international evidence-based publications and the Norwegian guidelines for treatment of Parkinson's disease. Results and interpretation Motor symptoms such as tremor at rest, akinesia, rigidity and postural instability are the cardinal signs in Parkinson's disease. After diagnosing a patient with the disease we recommend to start with selegiline as a disease-modifying treatment strategy. When symptoms lead to functional impairment, symptomatic treatment should be started in addition. Dopamine agonists are primarily recommended in younger patients and levodopa in the older ones. When the patients develop motor complications it is important to first thoroughly evaluate the problems to arrive at the best possible treatment strategy. If a sufficient response is not obtained both deep brain stimulation and treatment with continuous delivery of medication should be considered.",

      "title": "Chronic Pain and Depression: Understanding 2 Culprits in Common: Does a Shared Pathophysiology Hold the Key to Managing These Conditions When They Coexist?",
      "abstract": "[ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Any discussion of the relationship between major depressive disorder (MDD) and chronic encounters an obstacle immediately: Neither has a singular pathophysiology. Furthermore, MDD and, to a significant extent, chronic are defined more by their symptoms than by a presumed etiology and pathogenesis. Why does this matter to a busy clinician? Explicitly or implicitly, we often align our treatment approaches with what we assume is the underlying pathophysiology of the conditions we are addressing. An overview of shared pathophysiology of chronic conditions and MDD therefore can be useful in practice. What is chronic pain? Defined as pain that persists past the healing phase following an injury, (1) chronic often is subdivided into 4 types (2,3): * nociceptive (caused by a lesion or potential tissue damage) * inflammatory * neuropathic (spontaneous or hypersensitivity to related to neurologic illness or injury) * functional (hypersensitivity to due to abnormal central processing of a normal input). Although fibromyalgia often is categorized as a dysfunctional syndrome, persons who suffer from it, much like those who suffer neuropathic pain, commonly report hyperalgesia (augmented sensitivity to painful stimuli), allodynia (abnormal response to non-noxious stimuli), and paresthesias. These shared clinical features of fibromyalgia and neuropathic are consistent with central sensitization, which suggests overlapping pathophysiology. (4) Comorbidity between depression and is common. A 30% to 60% co-occurrence rate of MDD and chronic has been reported. (5) Some subtypes of chronic pain, such as fibromyalgia, are so commonly comorbid with psychiatric conditions that they have spawned a scientific debate as to whether the conditions are most parsimoniously considered (1) separate illnesses with high comorbidity or (2) different symptomatic manifestations of a single underlying condition. (6) Moreover, cumulative evidence suggests that chronic and depression do not just co-occur; each one facilitates development of the other, such that chronic is a strong predictor of subsequent onset of MDD, and vice versa. When and depression are comorbid, they also tend to make treatment of each condition more difficult. For example, presents (1) a major obstacle to achieving remission when treating depression (7,8) and (2) significant risk of relapse. (9) A 3-year longitudinal study showed that painful symptoms substantially reduced the chance of recovery in a group of older depressed patients (n = 327). A substantially greater percentage of patients with MDD alone attained recovery (47%), compared with only 9% in whom MDD and painful symptoms were comorbid. (10) Furthermore, a higher level of can delay remission when treating MDD, (11) thus reducing the likelihood of an optimal outcome. (12) Understanding shared processes. Recent developments in neuroscience and psychoimmunology point to the fact that comorbid and depression might be driven by overlapping pathophysiological processes in the brain and body. In the 2 parts of this article, we (1) review scientific understanding of these shared processes and (2) demonstrate how recent advances in the epidemiology, phenomenology, and etiology of chronic and MDD provide important clues for more effective diagnosis (Part 1) and treatment (Part 2, March 2016)--and, therefore, better outcomes. Our focus is primarily on the relationship between MDD and the best-studied comorbid chronic conditions: fibromyalgia, neuropathic pain, chronic back pain, and rheumatoid arthritis. The societal burden of chronic conditions is enormous A recent epidemiological study (13) projected that as many as 100 million people in the United States--30.7% of the population--suffer some form of chronic pain, including arthritis and joint pain. …",

We focused on alexithymia, an impairment of affective and cognitive emotional processing, as there is evidence for its interaction with cognition in other disorders. Twenty-two non-demented PD patients and 22 matched normal control adults (NC) were administered rating scales assessing neuropsychiatric status, including alexithymia, apathy, and depression, and a series of neuropsychological tests. As expected, PD patients showed more alexithymia than NC, and there was a significant association between alexithymia and disease stage. Alexithymia was associated with performance on non-verbally mediated measures of executive and visuospatial function, but not on verbally mediated tasks. By contrast, there was no correlation between cognition and ratings of either depression or apathy. Our findings demonstrate a distinct association of alexithymia with non-verbal cognition in PD, implicating right hemisphere processes, and differentiate between alexithymia and other neuropsychiatric symptoms in regard to PD cognition.",

Negative symptoms should be evaluated in a relation to positive symptoms both cross-sectionally and long term (prospectively/retrospectively). Two types of long-term interaction between negative and positive symptoms could be distinguished: (1) relatively synchronized, and (2) relatively desynchronized. Synchronization of negative and positive symptoms is characterized by their unidirectional long-term course. Desynchronization is characterized by their bidirectional long-term relations: (1) negative schizophrenia with minimal positive symptoms at the beginning of the disease and further progression of negative symptoms; or (2) schizophrenia with negative symptoms ‘that stopped at the very beginning’, and the later course is characterized by positive symptoms. Considering every single time point of the long-term relationship between negative and positive symptoms (cross-sectionally), the chapter describes the concept of ‘mutual/common syndromes’ (consisting of both positive and negative symptoms) at different stages of schizophrenia, including residual deficit states.",

      "abstract": "Neurological disorders lead to varying degrees of impairment in the functions of vital structures for swallowing, such as the cortex, cerebellum, brainstem, cranial nerves, and muscles. Neurogenic dysphagia is observed in approximately 50% of common neurological disorders such as stroke, multiple sclerosis, and Parkinson's disease. Although the pathophysiology and course of the disease vary, dysphagia may occur at any stage of swallowing, including oral preparation, oral, pharyngeal, and esophageal phases. Neurogenic dysphagia ranks among the top symptoms that restrict patients' independence in daily life activities, reduce their quality of life, and increase morbidity and mortality rates. Despite being a prevalent and highly impactful symptom among patients, neurogenic dysphagia can go unnoticed among the multiple symptoms experienced by neurological disorders due to their nature. It is important to be aware of disease-specific risk factors for the early detection of neurogenic dysphagia. Overlooked dysphagia can lead to complications such as aspiration pneumonia, dehydration, malnutrition, and weight loss. Among these complications, aspiration pneumonia is the most common, requiring attention due to its recurrent hospitalizations, inpatient treatment, and high healthcare costs. Many patients exhibit common neurogenic dysphagia symptoms such as drinking liquids in small sips, cutting solid foods into small pieces, decreased appetite, and prolonged meal times. The aim of this study is to examine various aspects of neurogenic dysphagia in different neurological disorders, including its etiology, risk factors, symptoms, and prevalence.",

      "title": "Nonmotor Symptoms of Parkinson's Disease",
      "abstract": "The nonmotor symptoms (NMSs) of Parkinson's disease (PD) have received a lot of attention in the last few years. Despite this fact, they have still been underrecognized and undertreated [1, 2]. NMS may include cognitive problems, apathy, depression, anxiety, hallucinations, and psychosis as well as sleep disorders, fatigue, autonomic dysfunction, sensory problems, and pain [1]. Since these symptoms substantially contribute to patients' quality of life and are a frequent cause of hospitalization and institutionalization, the NMSs and their management have been recognized by the UK National Institute for Clinical Excellence as an important unmet need in PD [3]. Besides dopamine and Lewy-type pathology involving both striatal and extrastriatal brain regions, deficits in other neurotransmitter systems and/or other types of brain pathologies seem to play a key role in the pathogenesis of NMS in PD [4–6].\r\n\r\nIt has been clearly shown that dopaminergic treatment improves motor symptoms and the quality of life in patients with PD. However, it only partly improves some features of the NMS, and it is not free from nonmotor side effects such as hallucinations and other psychotic symptoms, irritability, sleep attacks, and impulse control disorders. Furthermore, one study found that the patients who survived at 20 years from PD diagnosis suffered mainly from the nondopaminergic symptoms including falls, choking, dysarthria, but also dementia, visual hallucinations, daytime somnolence, symptomatic postural hypotension, and urinary incontinence [7]. Therefore, the management of these non-dopaminergic symptoms is a priority for research in the near future.\r\n\r\nIn addition to pharmacotherapy, high-frequency deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN DBS) is a powerful surgical treatment in well-selected candidates with advanced PD. STN DBS leads to improvements in dopaminergic drug-sensitive symptoms and reductions in subsequent drug dose and dyskinesias [8]. Although quality of life improves substantially, the procedure cannot be recommended for the treatment of NMS, and it may even cause specific cognitive side effects and may increase the risk for suicide. Skilled speech and physical therapy with cueing to improve gait, cognitive therapy to improve transfers, exercises to improve balance, and training to build up muscle power and increase joint mobility are efficacious. Regular physical and mental exercise is therefore recommended for all PD patients [9].\r\n\r\nAs outlined above, multidisciplinary approach including both pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatment of PD is essential; however, the current delivery of allied healthcare services is inadequate, and many people who require such care are not being referred to the relevant specialist. Parkinson's Standards of Care Consensus Statement will soon be released by the European Parkinson's Disease Association and should be implemented in Europe in the near future.\r\n\r\nBesides symptomatic treatment, search for the disease-modifying, neuroprotective, and restorative treatment of PD is ongoing. Despite many so far unresolved issues, gene- and stem-cell-based therapies as well as immunotherapy targeting alpha-synuclein might become treatment options in the future. Development of these therapies is dependent on an accurate and comprehensive understanding of the pathogenesis and pathophysiology of PD and on the ability of very early diagnosis of premotor stages of PD. Therefore, a search for specific biomarkers (clinical, neuroimaging, biochemical, genetic) for early (premotor) diagnosis and for the disease progression is essential and large multicenter trials are underway.\r\n\r\nThis special issue is dedicated to nonmotor symptoms of PD and focuses on the above-mentioned “old-new” topics. We sincerely hope that it will provide readers with interesting new data as well as with comprehensive up-to-date reviews. We wish our readers pleasant and inspiring reading.\r\n\r\n\r\nIrena Rektorova\r\n\r\nDag Aarsland\r\n\r\nK. Ray Chaudhuri\r\n\r\nAntonio P. Strafella",

The phenomena which the condition presents may be readily accounted for by assuming a defect or defects in the neurons, the cell units of which the nervous system is composed, of such a nature that stimuli from the environment may not properly reach the neurons of the cortex, or, having done so, the impression made there may not be sufficiently deep and lasting or, in other words, well elaborated. Keeping in mind this conception of neuronal defect, it is easy to understand how certain individuals fail to respond to educational influences, moral or intellectual or both. The subject of",

      "abstract": "The onset of concomitant strabismus in most cases occurs during early infancy or childhood.'The two major categories of early onset concomitant esotropia are accom- modative and congenital (infantile).While some disagreement exists as to the appropriate treatment of these strabismic disorders, there is general consensus that these are not usually causally related to any serious underlying neurological pathology.In contrast, the patient who presents with the acute onset of esotropia and diplopia should prompt a careful consideration of whether or not the strabismus is a sign of serious central nervous system pathology.First and foremost, one needs to establish if the deviation is concomitant or inconcomitant.An acute onset esotropia with incon- comitance must be considered to be the result of paresis of the lateral rectus muscle (abducens nerve) until proved otherwise.There is no doubt that the vast majority of neu- ropathic or myopathic causes of strabismus present as an inconcomitant deviation.On the other hand, does concomitancy in an acute onset esotropia assure one of the benign underlying nature of the strabismus?Until recently most authorities would probably have agreed that acute onset esotropia that is concomitant without divergence insufficiency is benign in nature with no risk that it might be associated with intracranial pathology.2Regrettably, it is now apparent that this simple algorithmic way of viewing acute onset esotropia, while valid in the vast majority of cases, is not appropriate in any single case since too many exceptions exist.Concomitancy in acute onset esotropia does not rule out the possibility of an underlying serious neurological condition.3How, then, is the clinician to evaluate the patient with acute onset concomitant esotropia?Does every patient with this form of strabismus deserve a neuroradiological and/or neurological evaluation?If not, what features or findings in a case of acute onset concomitant esotropia would indicate that this patient is at particular risk?In order to answer these questions an overview of the types of acute onset concomitant esotropia is necessary. Isolated acute onset concomitant esotropiaAlthough scattered reports of cases of acute onset esotropia can be found in the literature dating back over the past 100 years,-8 it is the paper of Burian and Miller that is generally accepted to be the pivotal work in this area.9In reviewing the literature and their own experience, these two authors presented a thesis that acute onset con- comitant esotropia could be separated into three distinct categories based on their clinical features and aetiology.Common to all three categories was the acute onset, con- comitancy, a relatively large angle of deviation, good binocular potential, and no underlying neurological disease.",

      "abstract": "Background: Parkinson’s disease is a common neurodegenerative movement disorder characterised by motor symptoms of rest tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity and postural instability and non-motor symptoms (NMS) which include neuropsychiatric symptoms, sleep disturbances, autonomic symptoms, sensory symptoms and symptoms of mixed aetiology. Parkinson’s Disease Non Motor Group (PD-NMG) devised a comprehensive clinic-based self-completed NMS questionnaire that allows easy identification of NMS by the physician. Most NMS have a poor response to dopaminergic therapy as it is due to dysfunction of the serotonergic and noradrenergic pathways. Treatment of these nonmotor symptoms help in improving the quality of life in patients with Parkinson’s disease.Methods: There were 100 patients with Parkinson’s disease who had presented to our neuromedicine movement clinic were included in the study. Patients were diagnosed as PD based on UK Parkinson’s disease brain bank criteria. The inclusion criteria were diagnosis as PD, age &gt;18 yrs, inclusion of both males and females and consent for the study. Patients with atypical parkinsonism and secondary parkinsonism, stroke, intake of antipsychotics were excluded from the study. Non motor symptom questionnaire was given to the study group and frequency of occurrence of each non motor symptoms and their predominance in both males and females were studied. The frequency of each NMS was calculated by computing the number of yes response and calculating the percentage related to the number of patients in the sample. Analysis was done to calculate the frequency of all NMS among the enrolled patient.Results: Nocturnal sleep disturbances (43%) were most common followed by constipation (29%).The most common non motor symptoms in males were constipation (20%), urinary urgency (18%) and nocturia (11%).The most common non motor symptoms in females were nocturnal sleep disturbance (25%), feeling sad (19%), unexplained pains (17%) and being anxious (13%).Conclusions: Non motor symptom questionnaire helps in screening patients with Parkinson’s disease of non-motor symptoms and aims at providing holistic treatment improving the quality of life.",

      "abstract": "As a neurodegenerative disorder, Parkinson’s disease (PD) is characterized by a combination of premotor, motor, and nonmotor symptoms. PD is commonly accompanied by psychosis, which is one of the commonest symptoms in the long run. As a result of Parkinson’s disease psychosis (PDP), symptoms can range from minor consequences of the disease (illusions, passage hallucinations, and presence hallucinations), to visual and nonvisual hallucinations and delusions. PDP is associated with a reduction in function and a reduction in quality of life as well. It is commonly believed that PDP is related to economic burden, and it has a significant impact on the utilization of long-term care services. The main focus should be on diagnosing, classifying, and managing PDP in an appropriate manner. As a first step in the management of PDP patients, the emphasis should be on identifying and treating any contributing medical factors, reducing or discontinuing medications that could cause or worsen psychosis, as well as nonpharmacological strategies and considering acetylcholinesterase inhibitors for treatment when dementia is present. A number of medications are being considered for use in PDP, including pimavanserin, quetiapine, and clozapine. The purpose of the current review is to provide a comprehensive understanding of the disorder in the general population with PD, including epidemiology, psychotic symptoms, risk factors, triggers, neuro-signaling pathways, diagnosis, and treatment of PDP.",

Mortalität und Pflegebedürftigkeit sind eng mit dem Auftreten von Demenz und Halluzinationen assoziiert. Der wichtigste Risikofaktor für das Auftreten dieser Komplikationen ist das Alter bei Erkrankungsbeginn. Stürze, Demenz und Halluzinationen manifestieren sich bei Patienten mit frühem Krankheitsbeginn erst nach deutlich längerem Verlauf als bei spätem Beginn des IPS. Weitere verlaufsrelevante Faktoren sind kognitive Störungen, motorischer Subtyp des IPS, Pharmakoresponsivität und genetische Disposition. Ob initial eine Behandlung mit L-Dopa oder Dopaminagonisten erfolgte war in Studien mit mehr als zehnjähriger Beobachtungsdauer für die langfristige Prognose von untergeordneter Bedeutung.",

I question whether encephalopathy or delirium is the best description. The first of 2 cardinal features of delirium on the Confusion Assessment Method (CAM)2 is acute confusion with fluctuating course. All the observations support sudden onset. The low median age of 43 years makes prior brain disease such as Alzheimer disease and stroke unlikely in most subjects. Figure 2 demonstrates great fluctuation in neuropsychological dysfunction.1 The second CAM cardinal feature is inattention. Twenty-one patients had impaired working memory. We can safely infer that almost all 21 had inattention; 10 patients with stupor or coma had inattention. Thus the first 2 cardinal features of delirium were fulfilled in an estimated 30 patients. CAM positivity requires disorganized thinking or altered level of consciousness. Ten had altered level of consciousness and many of the 24 patients whose Mini-Mental State Examination fell below 28 or the 5 who developed agitation would likely have disorganized thinking. I estimate 50% of these patients had CAM-positive delirium. In 584 key articles on delirium, this is the first report of delirium in adults with hemolytic uremic syndrome.",

Physical activity is known as one of the non-pharmacological methods to reduce behavioral, motor, biochemical, cardiovascular, and mitochondrial dysfunctions in Parkinson's disease. Although the basis of such biological and molecular benefits is unknown, the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of physical activity may improve the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Conclusion: Although there is no definitive cure for Parkinson's disease, the use of medications along with adjunctive therapies, such as exercise, can be resulted in promising improvements. However, more research is required to achieve an exercise program that provides optimal benefits to patients' quality of life and reduces mortality.",

In the assessment of cognitive functioning in the elderly, there are at least four ways in which a model or theoretical approach is useful for differentiating among the disorders affecting the elderly.

The medical and psychiatric history included marked anxiety presenting early and consistently in the disorder, outstanding memory disorder with the eventual development of a dementia, seizures, abnormal EEG, and a secondary carcinoma in the lung. The stage model has the potential for confirming or disconfirming a diagnosis because deviations from the predicted pattern of regression would signify that a different disorder is present.",

      "abstract": "Common causes of memory loss in older people are mild cognitive impairment, the various types of dementia, and psychiatric illness, mainly depression. Around 10% of patients with mild cognitive impairment progress to dementia each year. Alzheimer's disease accounts for 60-80% of cases. Other common types of dementia are vascular, fronto-temporal, Lewy body, Parkinson's, and mixed type dementia. There is evidence to suggest that dementia pathology is established before the onset of symptoms, and thus mild cognitive impairment can be considered as a predementia stage. NICE guidance suggests examination of: attention, concentration, short- and long-term memory, praxis, language and executive function. Particular attention should be paid to any signs of neglect, state of dress, agitation or poor attention. Dysphasia and difficulty in naming objects is often present. Mood symptoms (including suicidal ideation) may be primary or comorbid. Abnormal thoughts and perceptions should be probed for, as psychotic symptoms are common. Primary care options for cognitive testing include the General Practitioner Assessment of Cognition or the Abbreviated Mental Test Score. Physical examination should include observation of gait, inspection for tremor; examination for rigidity, bradykinesia, frontal release signs, upper motor neurone lesions, pulse and BP. Structural brain imaging can improve diagnostic accuracy, exclude other pathologies and act as a prognostic marker of dementia progression but the overlap in structural changes between the dementias makes imaging alone insufficient for diagnostic purposes. NICE guidelines recommend referral to a memory clinic for patients with mild cognitive impairment, those at high risk of dementia, such as patients with learning disabilities, Parkinson's disease, or patients who have had several strokes.",

Multiple system atrophies (MSAs), which are now divided into parkinsonian and cerebellar subtypes, are related disorders with core features that include autonomic and parkinsonian motor signs and α-synuclein-containing glial intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies. Progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration are parkinsonian dementias that superficially resemble PD and MSA in terms of motor features, but are distinguished pathologically by neurofibrillary tau protein abnormalities. Some other causes of dementia associated with parkinsonism include drug-induced parkinsonism, vascular parkinsonism, normal pressure hydrocephalus, prion diseases including Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker syndrome (see the chapter \"Rapidly Progressing Dementias\"), Alzheimer disease with extrapyramidal signs (see the chapter \"Alzheimer Disease Update\"), and metabolic derangements that have a predilection for basal ganglia structures.

Since there are no specific diagnostic criteria, true incidence and prevalence rates of VP are not known. Typically, parkinsonism in slow-onset VP tends to be bilaterally symmetrical, affecting the lower limbs more than the upper limbs (‘lower-body parkinsonism’), and resting tremor is usually absent. Commonly noted lesions on brain imaging in VP are lacunes, white matter changes and, rarely, territorial infarcts. As coincidental vascular lesions in idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (PD) are common, the mere presence of these lesions on brain imaging is not diagnostic of VP. Pathological evidence of a vascular disease in the absence of typical PD lesions (e.g. Lewy bodies) is the diagnostic ‘gold standard’. VP is generally considered to be poorly or non-responsive to L-dopa therapy. However, recent studies have shown a beneficial effect of L-dopa in a subset of patients.

There have been few relevant follow‐up or treatment studies and it is still not known whether the associated presence of brain injury or epilepsy influences the natural history or treatability of a given type of psychiatric disorder. Abnormalities of gestational length, complications of delivery or infection of the nervous system do not appear to increase the risk of psychiatric disorder unless followed by manifest signs of brain injury. Children with structural damage and fits, and children with temporal lobe epilepsy seem to be those who are most likely to develop a behaviour disturbance. Brain‐damaged children may suffer from any type of psychiatric condition. There is no particular disorder that occurs with disproportionate frequency in the neuro‐epileptic population, and by implication there do not seem to be any specific behavioural syndromes which are themselves pathognomonic of central nervous system damage or dysfunction. RÉSUMÉ Aspects psychiatriques des lésions cérébrales dans l'enfance Les enfants souffrant d'une lésion cérébrale ou d'une épilepsie ont un risque nettement accru de présenter un trouble psychiatrique. Les raisons n'en sont cependant pas très claires. Peu d'études longitudinales ou thérapeutiques ont été entreprises et il n'est toujours pas établi que la présence associée d'un traumatisme cérébral ou d'une épilepsie marque l'histoire naturelle ou la curabilité d'un type donné de trouble psychiatrique. Les anomalies du temps de gestation, les complications de l'accouchement ou les infections du système nerveux ne semblent pas accroitre le risque de troubles psychiatriques s'il n'y a pas eu de signes manifestes de lésion cérébrale. Les enfants présentant des troubles structurés ou des crises et les enfants avec épilepsie du lobe temporal sont ceux qui ont le plus de chances de développer un trouble du comportement. Une lésion cérébrale chez l'enfant peut évoluer vers n'importe quel type de condition psychiatrique. II n'y a pas de désordres particuliers survenant avec une fréquence disproportionnée dans une population neuroépileptique; par voie de conséquences, il ne semble y avoir aucun syndrome comportemental spécifique qui soit pathognomonique d'un dommage ou d'une dysfonction du système nerveux central. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Psychiatrische Aspekte der Hirnverletzungen im Kindesalter Kinder, die an einer Hirnverletzung oder einer Epilepsie leiden, haben ein bedeutend höheres Risiko eine psychische Störung zu entwickeln. Die Gründe dafür sind jedoch nicht ganz klar. Es sind nur wenig relevante Langzeit‐ oder Behandlungsstudien gemacht worden und es ist noch nicht bekannt, ob eine Hirnverletzung oder Epilepsie den normalen Verlauf einer bestimmten psychischen Erkrankung, oder die Ansprechbarkeit auf die Therapie beeinflussen. Abnorme Gestationsperioden, Komplikationen bei der Geburt oder Infektionen des Nervensystems scheinen das Risiko für die Entstehung einer psychischen Erkrankung nicht zu erhöhen, es sei denn es treten danach deutliche Zeichen eines Hirnschadens auf. Kinder mit Fehlbildungen, Krämpfen und Temporallappenepilepsie entwickeln offenbar am ehesten Verhaltensstörungen. Hirngeschädigte Kinder können jegliche Art eines psychiatrischen Zustandbildes bieten. Es gibt keine spezielle Erkrankung, die mit übermäßiger Häufigkeit bei dem neuro‐epilepti‐schen Krankengut vorkommt und damit scheint es keine spezifischen Verhaltenssyndrome zu geben, die selbst pathognomonisch für eine Schädigung oder Dysfunktion des Zentralnervensystems sind. RESUMEN Aspectos psiquiàtricos de la lesión cerebral en la infancia Los niños que sufren de lesión cerebral o de epilepsia corren un riesgo apreciablemente aumentado de padecer una alteración psiquiátrica. Sin embargo las razones de ello no están claras. Se han realizado pocos estudios seriados o estudios de tratamiento y todavía no se sabe si la presencia asociada de una lesión cerebral o de epilepsia influencia la evolución o la posibilidad de tratamiento de un determinado tipo de alteración psiquiátrica. Las anomalías en la duración gestacional, complicaciones del parto o infección del sistema nervioso, no parece que aumenten el riesgo de una alteración psiquiátrica, salvo que vayan seguidos de signos manifiestos de lesión cerebral. Los niños con alteración estructural y convulsiones y niños con epilepsia del lóbulo temporal parece que son los que tienen más tendencia a desarrollar una alteración en el comportamiento. Los niños con lesión cerebral pueden sufrir cualquier tipo de alteración psiquiátrica. No hay ninguna alteración en particular que aparezca en la población neuro‐epiléptica con una frecuencia desproporcionada y por implicación no parece que haya ningún síndrome especifico del comportamiento que sea por sí mismo patogmónico de una lesión o disfunción del sistema nervioso central.",

      "title": "Analysis of a murine Pink1 deficiency in serotonergic and dopaminergic neurons in respect of Parkinson´s disease",
      "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease (PD) is one of the most common age-related movement disorders. The main pathological symptoms include a degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNC) and the occurrence of Lewy bodies. As a result, PD patients typically exhibit severe motor symptoms like bradykinesia, tremor and strong gait impairments. Subtle gait impairments are attributed to the “non-motor” symptoms in the pre-motor phase of PD. In addition, PD patients can develop other non-motor symptoms like cognitive and olfactory impairments much earlier than the actual appearance of motor symptoms. Two main forms of PD are described: the familial form, caused by inherited mutations, and the sporadic form, mainly caused by environmental factors and risk genes. Mutations in the human gene Phosphatase and tensin homolog-induced kinase 1 (Pink1) are believed to lead to a loss of function of its kinase domain and is recessively inherited. In order to analyse possible PD related effects of Pink1 deficiency, the murine gene Pink1 was knocked out (KO) by deleting exon 2 & 3 (Pink1_del2/3). The phenotypes of this mouse line exhibiting complete loss of Pink1 function was described in a previous study.\r\nThese mice exhibited olfactory impairments and decreased serotonergic innervation of the olfactory bulb (OB). Likewise, Pink1_del2/3 mice showed gait impairments, although no neuronal degeneration in SNC was observed in aged mice. In order to understand the underlying mechanism of the Pink1 deficiency-related phenotypes and to uncover possible compensatory mechanisms, transgenic mice with a specific KO of Pink1 in serotonergic or dopaminergic neurons were analysed at young and middle age (mid-aged). Mice underwent a behavioural screening of open field testing (OF) followed by acoustic startle reflex analysis/prepulse inhibition (ASR/PPI), CatWalk testing and olfactory analysis. In addition, dopaminergic neurons were quantified in the SNC and the content of dopamine and serotonin was also measured. Furthermore, the respective metabolites were analysed in different brain regions. Finally, serotonergic innervation in the OB was examined. Overall, young and mid-aged mutant mice of both mouse lines did not display highly significant impairments in the OF, ASR/PPI and olfactory testing. The CatWalk analysis revealed some PD-related parameters affected in mutant mice. The neurotransmitter content did not differ in the different brain regions nor did the number of dopaminergic neurons in the SNC or the serotonergic innervation of the OB. In summary, a murine Pink1 deficiency in serotonergic or dopaminergic neurons did not lead to neuronal degeneration or biochemical changes. In addition, strong PD-related behavioural phenotypes were not observed. Nonetheless, both mouse lines exhibited subtle PD-related gait phenotypes. In conclusion, the serotonergic and dopaminergic system potentially plays a role in the development of PD-related non-motor symptoms upon Pink1 deficiency.",

      "title": "Parkinsonism or catatonia: That’s the question",
      "abstract": "Dear Sir, We read with interest the article by Dr. Jha, which describes a patient with catatonia syndrome, presumably due to extrapontine myelinolysis (EPM).[1] Psychiatry and neurology literature have both included the use of the term catatonia since 1874, and the exact pathophysiology and precise neurotransmitter abnormalities remain incompletely understood.[2] Moreover, due to the lack of a clear definition and the absence of a standardized description of the individual motor features, catatonia is often misdiagnosed. Patients with severe Parkinson's disease (PD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) exhibiting severe akinetic-rigid features and cognitive dysfunction may fulfill the diagnostic criteria of catatonia. In the case described by Dr. Jha, there were mild signal abnormalities in the basal ganglia. The majority of symptoms/signs described in the case (i.e., mutism, immobility, rigidity, negativism, staring, and drooling of saliva) can be observed in severe parkinsonism of any etiology. \"Waxy flexibility\" is controversial and often overlaps with rigidity.[3] The author mentioned that the absence of cogwheeling and tremors was the basis for distinguishing catatonic rigidity and parkinsonian rigidity. The distinction between catatonic and parkinsonian rigidity based solely on the absence of cogwheeling and tremor is less than conclusive, as these features are not definitive of parkinsonism. Therefore, in the absence of video documentation, it may become hard for the readers of this report to accept the diagnosis of catatonia. If catatonia was the initial diagnosis, why was levodopa preferred over benzodiazepines, especially when the latter has been historically considered the most effective treatment option for catatonia?[4] It is possible and more likely that the patient had parkinsonism in the context of EPM, which has been reported.[5-7] The patient's complete improvement with levodopa further supports this alternative hypothesis to the one presented by the author. We believe that a more careful clinical evaluation, inclusion of a video, and advanced imaging techniques (i.e.,Positron Emission Tomography (PET), Dopamine active Transporter (DaT) scans) could clarify the phenomenology to be more specifically aligned with parkinsonism rather than catatonia.

      "abstract": "Restless legs syndrome (RLS), also known as Willis-Ekbom disease, is a common sensorimotor disorder that may be idiopathic (primary) or secondary to a diverse group of conditions. The pathophysiology of primary RLS is only partly understood, but a strong association with brain iron deficiency possibly resulting in impaired dopaminergic function has been recognized. Genomic studies have established a genetic basis for primary RLS as well, and at least 42% of people with primary RLS possess a first-degree relative with the disorder. Secondary RLS is often associated with renal insufficiency, pregnancy, iron deficiency anemia, diabetic neuropathy, and Parkinson's disease. Approximately one-fourth of pregnant women experience RLS, with more intense symptoms experienced during the third trimester, and resolution of symptoms typically occurring within a few months after delivery, though RLS may resolve as early as 2 weeks after delivery. Restless legs syndrome is associated with increased prevalence of mood disturbances, sleep disturbances, and an impaired quality of life. The diagnosis of RLS involves 4 essential criteria related to a compelling urge to move the legs with an accompanying unpleasant sensation in the legs that is worse in the evening and at rest and improved by movement. Treatment of RLS incorporates both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic approaches. Dopamine agonists are the mainstay of RLS treatment, but other therapies, including gabapentin, benzodiazepines, and low-potency opioids, are also commonly employed.",

      "title": "Fatigue in Parkinson’s disease—A narrative review",
      "abstract": "Abstract Although fatigue is a common non-motor symptom of Parkinson’s disease (PD), it is often overlooked during routine assessments of individuals with PD. This can be attributed partly to the lack of recognition of this symptom and the coexistence of other confounding symptoms, such as apathy, somnolence, and depression. However, considering the effects of fatigue on the quality of life (QoL) of individuals with PD, it is crucial to review its causes and management strategies. According to the diagnostic criteria for PD-related fatigue, patients must report significantly reduced energy levels or an increased perception of effort disproportionate to their attempted activities. PD-related fatigue can be divided into central and peripheral types. Peripheral fatigue involves muscle weakness and impaired voluntary movements, influenced by tremors and bradykinesia. Central fatigue, which can be divided into mental and physical subtypes, manifests as persistent exhaustion without peripheral motor deficits. The pathophysiology of central fatigue in PD is complex. It involves dysfunction in the striato–limbic–serotonergic system, imbalance of neurotransmitters (dopamine and serotonin), as well as hypoconnectivity in the supplementary motor area and hyperconnectivity in the default mode network. Emerging evidence suggests that neuroinflammation and autonomic dysfunction may contribute to fatigue. Fatigue in PD is treated using pharmacological therapies (such as dopaminergic agents, antidepressants, methylphenidate, and modafinil) and non-pharmacological interventions (such as exercise). There is a gap in the current understanding, measurement, and treatment of fatigue in PD. A deeper understanding of the patho-mechanisms of fatigue in PD is needed to establish evidence-based treatment guidelines. The QoL of individuals with PD can be improved by focusing on person-centered interventions targeting fatigue.",

      "title": "Can Functional Visual Loss Occur in an Older Adult Patient With a History of Stroke: A Case Report",
      "abstract": "Aims Nonorganic visual loss, or functional blindness, is estimated to account for up to 5% of all presentations of blindness. This form of blindness can be ascribed to either a psychogenic aetiology or to malingering. Psychogenic blindness is often a manifestation of conversion disorder, in which a psychiatric condition impairs the normal physical functioning of the affected individual. This could lead to both motor and sensory defects, given that they are not better explained by an organic cause, which should be ruled out by investigations that prove an intact visual system. The individual would also commonly have an identifiable source of stress or trauma. Conversion disorders are less prevalent in older adults, and they may be missed where there are organic comorbidities. Methods A 67-year-old male with a recent history of stroke was diagnosed with a major depressive disorder, characterized by low mood, anhedonia, insomnia, fatigue, poor appetite, poor concentration, feelings of guilt, negative feelings about life, and hopelessness. Multiple social problems and family conflicts were identified as possible precipitating factors. Sertraline led to some good initial response, although it was later discontinued. A few months later, he developed severe depression with irritability and suicidal ideation, and he was repeatedly requesting euthanasia. At this point, there was a sudden loss of his vision. Following a thorough ophthalmology evaluation, neurological assessment, and investigations including MRI of the head, cortical blindness was ruled out. As a result, he was diagnosed with visual conversion disorder. After recommencing treatment for his depression with a psychotherapeutic approach as well as vortioxetine antidepressant medication, the visual loss resolved, and the issue has not recurred since then. There was also a significant improvement in his mood. He no longer feels suicidal and appears to be brighter and more socially interactive. Results Uncertainty regarding aetiology might initially arise if the patient has a history of trauma or a pathological condition that could cause blindness, such as diabetic retinopathy or stroke, both of which would have been differential diagnoses in the patient in this case had they not been debunked by further investigations, which included neuro-ophthalmic assessments and radiographic studies. The patient's improvement with antidepressants and counselling further supports the diagnosis of visual conversion disorder. Conclusion Functional blindness, which is an aspect of conversion disorder, may be a representation of how detrimental undiagnosed and untreated depression could be.",

      "abstract": "Corticobasal degeneration is a rare, progressive neurodegenerative disease and a member of the 'parkinsonian' group of disorders, which also includes Parkinson's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, dementia with Lewy bodies and multiple system atrophy. The most common initial symptom is limb clumsiness, usually affecting one side of the body, with or without accompanying rigidity or tremor. Subsequently, the disease affects gait and there is a slow progression to influence ipsilateral arms and legs. Apraxia and dementia are the most common cortical signs. Corticobasal degeneration can be difficult to distinguish from other parkinsonian syndromes but if ocular signs and symptoms are present, they may aid clinical diagnosis. Typical ocular features include increased latency of saccadic eye movements ipsilateral to the side exhibiting apraxia, impaired smooth pursuit movements and visuo-spatial dysfunction, especially involving spatial rather than object-based tasks. Less typical features include reduction in saccadic velocity, vertical gaze palsy, visual hallucinations, sleep disturbance and an impaired electroretinogram. Aspects of primary vision such as visual acuity and colour vision are usually unaffected. Management of the condition to deal with problems of walking, movement, daily tasks and speech problems is an important aspect of the disease.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disorder (PD) is a central nervous condition that causes tremors and affects mobility. Symptoms appear slowly, generally beginning with a slight shaking in one hand. Tremors are typical, but the disease can also cause stiffness or sluggish movement. Dopaminergic levels drop when nerve cells in the brain are damaged, leading to Parkinson's disease. The condition can start with tremors and progress to additional symptoms such as sluggish movements, stiffness, and a loss of balance. Therapy can help reduce the symptoms of Parkinson's disease, but it can't cure it. It is critical to obtain diagnostic testing by laboratory or imaging tests. A therapy expert can show how to make the proper motions to improve movement, flexibility, and balance while still allowing the patient to maintain personal independence. Exercising can help strengthen the muscles, improve flexibility and balance. Therapy can also boost mood and help the patient cope with sadness or anxiety.",

The unpredictable nature of PD and the inability to halt or slow disease progression may result in uncertainty and psychological stress. Uncertainty and psychological stress have important implications for symptom and health outcomes in PD. Uncertainty and psychological stress have been shown to worsen symptoms, functional capacity, and quality of life in chronic illnesses; however, the causal mechanisms have yet to be elucidated. We propose a biobehavioral framework for examining uncertainty and psychological stress in PD. The framework considers factors that may contribute to uncertainty and neuroendocrine–immune mechanisms of uncertainty and psychological stress that may influence symptom and health outcomes in PD, for the ultimate purpose of improving symptom and disease progression, functional capacity, and quality of life.",

      "abstract": "Auteur(s) : Christian Derouesne La troisieme conference internationale sur la demence a corps de Lewy (DCL) [1] reconnait les difficultes du diagnostic liees a la faible sensibilite des criteres utilises. Deux elements y concourent : la difficile appreciation des fluctuations cognitives, elements cles du diagnostic, et de la faible frequence de conjonction des trois criteres principaux qui semble liee a la presence d’une pathologie de type Alzheimer associee. Les criteres proposes pour un diagnostic de DCL probable sont : 1) la presence des trois signes majeurs : fluctuations cognitives avec des variations prononcees de l’attention et de la vigilance ; hallucinations visuelles recurrentes et detaillees ; presence de signes parkinsoniens spontanes ; 2) la presence de 1 ou plus des signes majeurs s’il existe 1 ou plus signes suggestifs. Le diagnostic de DCL possible peut etre porte chez un sujet dement, en l’absence de signes majeurs, devant 1 ou plus des signes suggestifs suivants : 1) troubles du sommeil paradoxal que traduit une agitation nocturne (les patients « agissent leurs reves ») ; 2) severe sensibilite aux neuroleptiques ; 3) mise en evidence d’un deficit dopaminergique dans les noyaux gris par la tomoscinigraphie. D’autres signes sont communs mais manquent de specificite : 1) signes de dysautonomie : hypotension orthostatique, chutes ou syncopes, instabilite neurocardiovasculaire, incontinence urinaire, impuissance, constipation ; 2) delire systematise ; 3) hallucinations autres que visuelles ; 4) depression ; 5) relative preservation des structures temporales internes en IRM ; 6) ralentissement diffus a l’EEG ; 7) hypoperfusion cerebrale generalisee, notamment dans les regions occipitales. Au plan neuropsychologique, la differenciation avec la MA repose sur une double dissociation : dans la DCL, la preservation relative de la denomination, du rappel a court et moyen terme comme de la reconnaissance contraste avec l’alteration de la fluence verbale, de la perception visuelle et des performances visuospatiales. Pour diminuer les difficultes d’appreciation des fluctuations, les auteurs recommandent d’utiliser les echelles de fluctuations cognitives proposees par Walker et al. [2] (la Clinician assessment of fluctuation scale necessite toutefois une plus grande expertise que la One day fluctuation assessement scale) ou la Mayo fluctuations composite scale pour differencier les fluctuations de la DCL de celles qui sont observees dans la MA [3]. Les criteres histopathologiques sont precises, notamment la quantification des lesions de type Alzheimer. L’article se conclut sur l’interet d’un traitement combine par les inhibiteurs de la cholinesterase et les dopaminergiques [4]. Quant a la question des rapports entre demence parkinsonienne (definie par l’apparition d’une demence chez un parkinsonien de longue date) et la DC (dans laquelle les signes parkinsoniens ne doivent pas avoir precede la demence de plus de 1 an), le consortium considere que cette distinction doit etre maintenue pour des raisons cliniques, mais qu’au niveau de la recherche, clinicopathologique ou therapeutique, les deux phenotypes peuvent etre reunis sous le terme de maladie a corps de Lewy ou alpha-synucleinopathie ! 1. McKeith IG, Dickson DW, Lowe J, Emre M, O’Brien JT, Feldman H, et al.

Rehabilitation should be initiated early and directed toward functional objectives defined by a pluridisciplinary team. To maintain movements is a fundamental aim and must take into account the tiredness of the old subject. Gymnic, active and passive techniques are proposed to preserve the posture, balance and walk. The prevention of falls is a major goal to avoid the risks of grabatisation and trauma. Multiple respiratory disorders are related to disturbances of swallowing and affect the deficiencies of voice and speech. The objectives of care are different if the patient presents a parkinsonan syndrome different from Parkinson's disease or if dementia is associated.

One useful strategy is to determine if a patient has a constellation of symptoms and findings that fits within a broad category or syndrome, which then narrows the differential diagnosis and allows the clinician to commence a focused work-up. For example, the differential diagnosis and spectrum of available diagnostic studies for a patient with dementia, or a patient with parkinsonism, are rather wide; these are far more restricted in those who have elements of both dementia and parkinsonism. Furthermore, an insidious onset and progressive course suggests a neurodegenerative disease as the likely underlying process.

Epilepsy rarely dominates the clinical presentation, which is more frequently associated with other neurologic symptoms, such as mental retardation, hypotonia and/or dystonia, or vigilance disturbances. The pathogenesis of seizures is multifaceted; inherited metabolic disorder can affect the balance between excitatory and inhibitory chemical mediators, eliminate an energetic substrate at the cerebral level, cause in utero brain malformation, or provoke acute brain lesions. Some clinical disorders that strongly suggest particular metabolic etiologies can be identified. For example, specific clinical signs and findings on electroencephalogram (EEG) are characteristic of pyridoxine-dependent seizures, and inherited metabolic disorders associated with early myoclonic encephalopathy are well defined. In most cases, however, epilepsy secondary to inherited metabolic disorders presents with polymorphic clinical and EEG features that are difficult to classify into precise epileptic syndromes. Common characteristics of these seizures include onset in the first months of life; usually partial, multifocal; simple partial motor semiology; successive appearance of tonic seizures, spasms, and massive myoclonus; and resistance to antiepilepsy drugs.

      "abstract": "In the Indian system of medicine, there are two psychosomatic stages, namely ‘Prakriti’ (natural stage) and ‘Vikriti’ (deform stage), that are significantly discussed in the context of human wellbeing. The natural stage is identified as the 'Prakriti', and the deformed stage is the ‘Vikriti’. When the Tridosha (or Panchadosha) becomes balanced (the natural stage), no psychosomatic diseases occur, and when the Tridosha (or Panchadosha) becomes misbalanced (the deform stage), then all diseases appear in their psychosomatic forms. According to the Indian system of medical philosophy, various types of diseases are caused by the mind, i.e., Panchavikara. These Panchavikaras produce the Panchadosha, which causes entire diseases on the psychophysical dimensions. All psychosomatic diseases manifest on the mental or physical level in two forms. Firstly, diseases are caused by the negative law of Karma, where almost 95% of psychosomatic diseases are caused by internal factors deeply rooted in the subconscious mind due to past acquired negative Karma, namely Panchavikara. Conversely, almost 05% of psychosomatic diseases are caused by external factors that are connected to the present negative karma-made subconscious mind. The principles of modern pathology are prominently based on these three misconceptions. Firstly, the cause of similar diseases in the various individuals is assumed to be similar. Secondly, it is assumed that most diseases occur on a physical level. Thirdly, the existence of the soul is denied. Vice versa, the soul-centric system of Indian medicine strongly considers that every individual is a unique and incredible being. Diseases are caused by the different factors for similar diseases in the different individuals due to the deferring law of Karma individually; thus, most diseases are considered psychic Ragatmaka Mantra therapy heals especially the outer subconscious (Manomaya Sharira) and inner subconscious mind (Karana Sharira). This therapy eradicates all psychosomatic diseases from their root causes in the subconscious mind forever.",

      "abstract": "Introdução: A doença de Parkinson (DP) é a causa mais comum de parkinsonismo, síndrome caracterizada por bradicinesia, rigidez muscular e tremor de repouso.Sua prevalência aumentou no último século, sendo a segunda doença neurodegenerativa mais comum.Suas causas ainda não estão estabelecidas, com fatores ambientais e genéticos aparecendo como candidatos potenciais.Seu tratamento está centrado no emprego de fármacos com atividade dopaminérgica, todavia incapazes de modificar o curso da doença.Dentre os distúrbios não motores, destacamos os transtornos cognitivos e de sono, muitas vezes precedendo em anos os sintomas motores.A prevalência de DP-CCL e DDP pode variar de 25% a 80% em ambulatórios especializados.O sono representa a \"suspensão reversível da interação sensório motor com o ambiente, geralmente associada à imobilidade\".Tem sido postulado sua importância para a plasticidade neuronal, consolidação da aprendizagem e clearance de substâncias amiloides, onde a perturbação na quantidade e qualidade do sono, parecem influenciar negativamente a cognição.Objetivo: Investigar se a presença de transtornos do sono estão relacionados à evolução da perda cognitiva e à sobrevida de pacientes com DP após 10 anos.Métodos: Através de um estudo de coorte, foram reavaliados 43 dos 79 indivíduos avaliados na etapa I. Os pacientes foram submetidos a reavaliação cognitiva seguindo os critérios propostos pelo algoritmo nível 2 de Dubois, 2007 e DP-CCL MDS, 2013.Resultados: Na etapa II foram avaliados 55% dos pacientes da etapa I. O tempo médio entre as duas avaliações foi de 105,8 meses.A amostra II foi composta por pacientes mais idosos (p<0.001),com menor escolaridade (p<0.001),usando antidepressivos com maior frequência (p=0.001),com sintomas mais graves (p<0.001),em estágios mais avançados da doença (p<0.001) e com desempenho inferior nos escores totais de MEEM e MDRS.Houve predominância de mulheres e menor escolaridade entre os pacientes que faleceram (X²(1)= 2,88, p = 0,009).O uso de antidepressivos e o tempo de sono REM, na valiação inicial, foi proporcionalmente maior entre os pacientes que sobreviveram (X²(1)= 4,597; p= 0,032).Menor declínio cognitivo mensurado pela MDRS mostrou associação com menor dose diária equivalente de levodopa (ρ=0,604; p<0,001).Maior declínio cognitivo no MEEM foi relacionado a maior sonolência diurna medida pela escala de Epworth (ρ=0,414, p=0,009) e menor proporção de sono N1 (ρ= -0,404, p=0,012).O maior declínio no domínio de memória em MDRS foi relacionado a menor porcentagem de sono total despendido na fase N1 (ρ= -0,364, p= 0,025) e como total de minutos em sono REM (ρ= -0,395, p= 0,25).A sobrevida geral da amostra foi de 79% em 62 meses.Pacientes com DDP tem o risco relativo para óbito aumentado em 4,74 vezes, com homens tendo 73% menor risco relativo de morte.Conclusão: Pacientes com DP apresentam evolução mais favorável quando foram associados a serem mais jovens, ter maior escolaridade, usar doses equivalentes menores de levodopa e ter menos sonolência diurna.",

The presence of etiological factors in the patient, such as type 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus, alcohol intoxication in the anamnesis or other causes of polyneuropathy, which are often found in practice, can disguise chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy and lead to delayed diagnosis of potentially curable polyneuropathy, which further increases the likelihood of disability of the patient and a significant decrease in the quality of his life. The clinical case under consideration is a demonstration of such diagnostic difficulties, which led to a delayed diagnosis of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy against the background of alcohol abuse in the debut of neurological disorders.",

      "abstract": "The cognitive (executive) ability of patients with Parkinson's-disease (PD) deteriorates gradually during the progression of the disease. Fluency of speech, word finding, working memory, ability to plan the future and flexibility decline. Cognitive disturbance was found to be proportional with the speech, posture, gait and balance problems and can not be influenced by L-dopa substitution. Apart the dorsal and ventral mesolimbic dopaminergic systems the coerulo-cortical noradrenergic, serotoninergic and cholinergic systems are also impaired in PD. Subcortical dementia in PD can also be explained by the functional disability of dorsolateral and anterior cingular circuits. Attention deficit can be explained by the dopamine depletion of cingular cortex. Cortical Lewy bodies, neurofibrillary tangles, neurit plaques and additional vascular pathology should also play a role in cognitive impairment of PD. In several systemic degenerative diseases associating with Parkinson's syndrome (PS) i.e. progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), multiple system atrophy (MSA) dementia can be detected with various severity, therefore the question arises concerning the correlation between cognitive disability and PS. Parkinson syndrome can also develop in frontotemporal dementias (FTD), Alzheimer's disease and cortical Lewy body disease (CLBD) but no correlation exists between motor disability and severity of dementia. In CLBD dementia can be the initial symptom in 18% of cases but PS can also preceeds the dementia. In PSP profound depletion of other monoaminergic neurotransmitter system was also reported. In FTDs associated with PS degeneration of substantia nigra, locus coeruleus and basal nucleus of Meynert has been reported with increased number of neurofibrillary tangles. In patients with vascular PS (VP) there is generally no tremor and rigidity, but pseudobulbar palsy, dementia, gate disturbance, incontinency appears; L-dopa treatment is generally ineffective. In VP no cellular loss can be found within the substantia nigra, but leukoaraiosis, lacunae in the white matter and basal ganglia are commonly demonstrated.",

Any one of the syndromes listed in Table 4–1 can occur in either an isolated form, affecting only a single area or single cell type in the nervous system, or as part of a more widespread disorder called by Henson and colleagues encephalomyelitis with carcinoma.1 However, even when the clinical findings are restricted to dysfunction of the brain, autopsy studies usually reveal more widespread abnormalities, particularly inflammation.1 The classification given in Table 4–1 is by no means clinically discrete. For example, sleep disorders may occur with either hypothalamic or brainstem dysfunction, or both. Parkinsonian-like syndromes may arise from the basal ganglia or the substantia nigra of the midbrain. Nevertheless, this classification allows a structure for thinking about paraneoplastic neurologic symptoms. With the exception of limbic encephalitis, these disorders are quite rare.",

      "abstract": "The burden of depression on society is sizable. Innate to this burden are underdiagnosis and under-treatment of unipolar and bipolar major depressive disorder in all parts of the health care system in part due to underrecognition of the physical symptoms that commonly are core components of major depressive disorder. Physical pains especially complicate the diagnosis of depression. Many patients de-emphasize psychosocial symptoms while emphasizing pains as their primary or sole complaints. There is a high correlation between the number of physical symptoms reported and the presence of depression. Additionally, patients with residual physical and emotional symptoms following treatment for depression appear to be at higher risk of relapse compared with those who have no residual symptoms. Complex genetic vulnerabilities underlie the depressive diathesis, and stress appears to be an accentuation for the gene expression that sets off episodes of depression in persons with these predispositions. If underdiagnosis interferes and acute treatment is not implemented early and effectively for initial episodes of depression and maintained after remission, individuals with genetic vulnerabilities may experience a pattern of recurrences, cycle acceleration, and increased severity. Serotonin and norepinephrine may be shared neurochemical links that tie depression and physical symptoms together. Thus, it is reasonable to hypothesize that antidepressants that incorporate both serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibition might be a more efficacious treatment approach for patients with physical symptoms of depression.",

      "abstract": "The most common four neurodegenerative atypical parkinsonian disorders (APDs) are progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), multiple system atrophy (MSA), corticobasal syndrome (CBS), and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Their formal diagnostic criteria often require subspecialty experience to implement as designed and all require excluding competing diagnoses without clearly specifying how to do that. Validated diagnostic criteria are not available at all for many of the other common APDs, including normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH), vascular parkinsonism (VP), or drug-induced parkinsonism (DIP). APDs also include conditions of structural, genetic, vascular, toxic/metabolic, infectious, and autoimmune origin. Their differential diagnosis can be challenging early in the course, if the presentation is atypical, or if a rare or non-neurodegenerative condition is present. This review equips community general neurologists to make an early provisional diagnosis before, or in place of, referral to a tertiary center. Early diagnosis would allay diagnostic uncertainty, allow prompt symptomatic management, provide disease-specific information and support resources, avoid further pointless testing and treatments, and create the possibility of trial referral.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after the dementia of Alzheimer. The clinical presentation of PD is dominated by typical motor symptoms as resting tremor, cogwheel rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability. Non-motor symptoms (NMS) of Parkinson's disease are common but are often under-recognized in clinical practice either due to the lack of spontaneous complaints by the patients or to the absence of systematic questioning by healthcare professionals. In contrast to motor dysfunctions, non-motor symptoms frequently remain unreported. Recently, a self-completed NMS questionnaire and NMS scale for identification and evaluation of these symptoms have been validated. An international survey has shown that up to 62% of NMS in PD remain undeclared to healthcare professionals because patients are unaware that NMS symptoms are linked to PD. Based on both clinical and neuropathological data, PD, traditionally accepted as a dopaminergic motor disorder, now can be characterized as a multisystem neurodegenerative disease that involves many neurotransmitter systems and affects not only motor but non-motor functions, too.",

      "abstract": "Many depressive symptoms are seen in the normal course of Parkinson's disease (PD) (Table 1). (1) As a result, depression--the most common neuropsychiatric disturbance in PD--is difficult to assess in PD and easily can go undetected and untreated. (2) Making the diagnosis is important, however, because depression causes PD patients suffering and may accelerate decline in motor and cognitive function, activities of daily living, and quality of life. (3) In the absence of specific guidelines (Box, page 80), (4) we provide evidence to help you sort through the overlapping symptoms to find clinical signs that differentiate depression from PD symptoms. (5,6) DSM-IV-TR depression criteria Approximately 20% of PD patients meet DSM-IV-TR criteria for major depression, and another 20% meet criteria for dysthymia. (5) By DSM-IV-TR criteria, (6) diagnosis of a major depressive episode requires [greater than or equal to]5 of 9 symptoms, of which at least 1 is depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure. Because these symptoms must be present during the same 2-week period and represent a change in functioning, this diagnosis has an acute quality. Dysthymia--also frequently called chronic depression--is characterized by a mostly depressed mood for 2 years, accompanied by [greater than or equal to]2 of 6 symptoms: appetite changes, sleep changes, low energy/fatigue, low self-esteem, poor concentration/indecisiveness, and hopelessness. (6) All of these depression symptoms may overlap with those of PD. 1 Mood. In mid-stage and late PD, mood often fluctuates in concert with daily periods of increased rigidity and tremor (off periods) interspersed with improved motor functioning (on periods). (7) Thus, when evaluating the PD patient: * take a detailed history of motor fluctuations and their associations with mood symptoms * also evaluate mood during on periods. 2 Interest and pleasure. Differentiating decreased interest from apathy is one of the greatest challenges in diagnosing depression in PD. The neurologic symptom of apathy in PD includes 3 features: * behavioral (lack of effort) * cognitive (loss of interest/concern) * affective (decreased emotional response or flat affect). Some studies have described apathy as a common feature of PD that can occur independent of depression; (8) others have associated apathy with cognitive impairment. (9) Anhedonia also seems to be more common in PD patients than in matched controls, apparently independent of PD's neurologic, frontal, and depressive aspects. (10) 3 Weight changes. Patients with PD tend to have lower body weight than matched subjects. As a result, weight loss in the course of PD can be confused with weight loss associated with depression. Weight loss appears to start 2 to 4 years before a PD diagnosis and continues thereafter. Despite the weight loss, PD patients report higher energy intake after the diagnosis compared with individuals without PD. (11) A related, not necessarily contradictory finding is that a higher premorbid body mass index (BMI) seems to be associated with an increased risk of developing PD. (12) In general, dopaminergic treatment of PD seems to be associated with weight loss. (13) However, weight gain has been reported after pramipexole treatment, which the authors of the study attributed to limbic D3 receptor stimulation. (14) 4 Sleep and excessive daytime sleepiness. Sleep disturbances are very common in individuals with PD. (15) A community study found that two-thirds of PD patients complained of sleep problems, with sleep fragmentation and early awakening being the most common complaints. (16) Initial insomnia was less common, and a surprisingly high number of PD patients reported symptoms that suggested obstructive sleep apnea, periodic limb movements of sleep, and REM sleep behavior disorder. …",

      "title": "Sleep disorders in Parkinson syndromes",
      "abstract": "Abstract About 90% of neurodegenerative diseases with parkinsonism are associated with sleep disorders including daytime sleepiness, sleep-related breathing disorders and parasomnias. It is hard to define what ratio of insomnia and daytime hypersomnia is caused by the antiparkinsonian treatment, by the somatic and mental-emotional symptoms of the neurodegenerative disease and by the neurodegenerative brain process itself. Recent research suggests that the latter group is more important than expected. In Parkinson syndromes the structures included in sleep regulation--mainly within the brainstem--are also affected resulting in specific sleep disorders being the primary biological symptoms of these diseases. The recently described parasomnia--REM sleep behavior disorder--has a specific significance in this respect: it may prevent by several years a high ratio of the parkinsonian disorders--especially synucleinopathies--offering the possibility of prevention by identifying the affected individuals. There seems to exist a similar although less clarified association between daytime sleepiness and Parkinson disease. Analysing the behavior of the orexin system in neurodegenerative diseases may help to learn more about this, recently described neurohumoral system and may clear the association of narcolepsy with neurodegeneration. By understanding the associations of parkinsonian disorders and sleep disorders new therapeutical strategies may be invented and may offer new aspects to understand the mechanism of them.",

      "title": "Diabetic Proximal Neuropathy: Therapy and Prognosis",
      "abstract": "Diabetic proximal neuropathy goes by a bewildering variety of names: diabetic femoral neuropathy, amyotrophy, neuropathic cachexia, anterior neuronopathy, polyradiculopathy, myopathy, mononeuritis multiplex or lumbar plexopathy. We are all familiar with the typical syndrome in elderly in Type 2 diabetics who develop severe unilateral anterior thigh pain followed by wasting and weakness of the quadriceps muscle with loss of the knee jerk [1]. This soon becomes bilateral in roughly 50 per cent of patients. The underlying pathogenic mechanisms have not yet been identified. It is presumed that peripheral nerve infarcts are responsible for those cases which develop acutely over a few days. However, an earlier report of small peripheral nerve infarcts in an autopsy study [2] has been tempered by subsequent recognition that such lesions can be difficult to distinguish from Renaut bodies, a non-specific histopathological finding [3]. Furthermore, any theory that proximal diabetic neuropathy represents nerve infarction due to diabetic microvascular disease would have to account for the rarity with which it is accompanied by diabetic retinopathy or nephropathy, [4] the excellent recovery achieved by many patients, and the marked tendency for abnormalities to develop symmetrically on the two sides within a few weeks of one another [4, 5]. The other end of the clinical spectrum is less well recognized: symmetrical proximal muscle weakness of slow onset, which is relatively painless and is presumed to be metabolic in origin [6-8]. A paper in this issue of the journal by Coppack and Watkins [5] addresses two important issues concerning the treatment and prognosis of diabetic proximal neuropathy. First, does hypoglycaemic therapy really aid recovery of the leg weakness? Second, to what extent do these patients ultimately recover from disability which may be seriously incapacitating for many months? There is no doubt that many patients with diabetic proximal neuropathy do recover. Few physicians can resist the temptation to improve glycaemic control in patients who develop diabetic proximal neuropathy and most feel this action is responsible for recovery when it occurs. But is hypoglycaemic therapy itself really responsible for recovery, or is recovery merely part of the natural history of diabetic proximal neuropathy? Garland [9] stated that 'the only treatment necessary is full diabetic control. . . the use of insulins is almost invariably essential' a view supported by Casey and Harrison [10]. However it is clear that diabetic proximal neuropathy can develop in patients with rather mild glucose intolerance, and that recovery can coincide merely with the institution of a low calorie diet, without additional hypoglycaemic medication [7, 10].",

      "title": "On General Paralysis",
      "abstract": "In attempting to describe the rise and progress of the paralysis, that forms one of the most remarkable symptoms of ‘paralytic insanity,’ I propose to notice first the affection of the muscles of the tongue, which is generally that which most strongly arrests the attention of the physician, who sees a patient in the second or fully-developed stage of the malady. In the last stage, the power of articulation is entirely gone; in both of these the paralysis is so marked, and the evidence of mental disease so clear, that the nature of the case can hardly be mistaken. It is in the very onset of the malady, that the peculiar lisp or failure of utterance, indicating disorder of the nervous centres, at or near the orifice of the nerves supply in the tongue muscles, is of paramount importance in the diagnosis, because if this symptom be superadded to eccentricity of conduct, or distinct delusion, there can remain but little doubt as to the existence of this special and almost invariably fatal form of disease. The alienist physician accustomed to watch the progress of general paralysis, and to recognize its slightest indication, cannot mistake the faulty pronounciation in question, for that of any other form of malady; but inasmuch as there are several affections of the speech that might mislead an unskilled practitioner, it may be useful to describe some of these derangements of the apparatus of articulation, and specify their points of difference. In the first place, an affection of the speech, very much resembling the embarassed articulation of incipient paralytic insanity, may be the result of temporary local congestion at the base of the brain, or may be produced by sudden fright, or by the action of poisons, particularly aconite; the indistinct utterance attending intoxication, is a familiar instance of poisoning of this kind: and all these are easily distinguished by the suddenness of their occurrence, and by their history, from the stutter of general paralysis. The articulation of the habitual stammerer is sometimes not unlike that which is the result of serious organic mischief; and still more striking in its resemblance, is the hesitation of speech, that may be observed in some cases of poisoning by lead. The ordinary signs of saturnine poisoning, the blue gum-line, the dropping of the wrist, &amp;c., will mark this latter malady—the history of the case will prevent any mistake in the former. I may mention here, that I believe it to be an exceptional occurrence to find a person of unsound mind who stammers; such a case at least must be very uncommon, a fact which I can only account for on the supposition that the greater disease prevents any manifestation of the minor nervous derangement.",

      "title": "Neuroinflammatorische Prozesse beim idiopathischen Parkinson-Syndrom : antiinflammatorische Intervention als mögliche Therapieoption?",
      "abstract": "Das Idiopathische Parkinson-Syndrom (IPS, Morbus Parkinson), erstmalig 1817 von James Parkinson beschrieben, ist die zweithaufigste neurodegenerative Erkrankung nach Morbus Alzheimer. Die Erkrankung betrifft 1-2% der Gesamtpopulation der uber 65-jahrigen. Das pathologische Korrelat der Erkrankung ist die progressive Degeneration dopaminerger Neurone in der Substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) des Mittelhirns. Dieser neuronale Zellverlust fuhrt zur Verarmung des Striatums an Dopamin. Wenn ca. 50% der dopaminergen Neurone der SNc abgestorben und damit ca. 70-80% des striatalen Dopamins verloren ist, entwickeln die Patienten die typischen Kardinalsymptome Bradykinese, Ruhetremor, Rigor und posturale Instabilitat aus.\r\nMikroglia sind die residenten Gewebsmakrophagen des ZNS und „Schlusselzellen“ in der Initiierung und Unterhaltung von Entzundungsreaktionen im Gehirn. Aktivierte Mikrogliazellen setzen proinflammatorische und bekanntermasen neurotoxische Molekule frei. Die Degeneration der dopaminergen Nigraneurone beim IPS geht mit einer chronischen Entzundungsreaktion, d.h. Mikrogliaaktivierung, einher. Wahrend wahrscheinlich endogene (genetische Pradisposition) und exogene Faktoren (z.B. Umweltgifte) den dopaminergen Zelltod einleiten, besteht kein Zweifel, dass die begleitende neuroinflammatorische Reaktion den Zellverlust verstarkt. Von degenerierenden dopaminergen Neuronen in den Extrazellularraum freigesetzte Molekule stehen in Verdacht, die chronische Mikrogliaaktivierung zu unterhalten. Ein circulus vitiosus aus Nervenzelldegeneration und einer daraus resultierenden Aktivierung von Mikrogliazellen mit Freisetzung neurotoxischer Faktoren kann so zur Progression der Erkrankung beitragen. Wirkstoffe, die die Mikrogliaaktivitat hemmen, um diesen Teufelskreis zu durchbrechen, geraten aus diesem Grund mehr und mehr in den Fokus der Parkinsonforschung.\r\nMikrogliazellen expremieren den peripheren Benzodiazepinrezeptor (PBR). Unter physiologischen Bedingungen erfolgt nur eine schwache Bindung des PBR Liganden PK11195 an Mikrogliazellen, wohingegen nach einem neuronalen Schaden die mikrogliale Expression von PBR stark ansteigt. Eine verstarkte Bindung von radioaktiv markiertem [3H][R]-PK11195 am PBR in PET Studien in klinisch-experimentellen Untersuchungen beim Menschen gilt somit als Marker fur eine Schadigung des ZNS. Die Starke des [3H][R]-PK11195 Signals korreliert hier unmittelbar mit der Krankheitsaktivitat. Da die Funktion des PBR bei aktivierten Mikrogliazellen unbekannt ist, ist es das Ziel der vorliegenden Arbeit, verschiedene PBR-Liganden in vitro auf ihr antiinflammatorisches Potenzial hin zu untersuchen. Primare Mikrogliakulturen expremieren den PBR. Diese Expression konnte in dieser Arbeit durch die RT-PCR, im Western-Blot und immunzytochemisch nachgewiesen werden. Die Starke der Expression korrelierte hier mit dem Aktivierungsgrad der Mikroglia. Die in dieser Arbeit untersuchten Benzodiazepine (Clonazepam, Midazolam, Diazepam) und der PBR-Ligand (PK11195) verminderten die Proliferation und die Freisetzung der neurotoxischen Molekule Stickstoffmonoxid (NO) und Tumor necrosis Faktor-α (TNF-α) im Vergleich zu Lipopolysaccharid (LPS)-aktivierten Kontrollen. \r\nα-Synuclein (α-Syn) Aggregate sind ein Hauptbestandteil von senilen Plaques und Lewy-Korperchen (LB) und spielen eine zentrale Rolle bei einer Gruppe von neurodegenerativen Erkrankungen, den sog. Synucleinopathien (IPS, Morbus Alzheimer, Demenz mit Lewy-Korperchen (LBD), Multisystematrophie (MSA)). Die Exposition von primaren Mikrogliakulturen mit α-Synuclein Protofibrillen (α-Syn PF) fuhrt analog zur LPS-Exposition zum aktivierten Phanotyp mit konsekutiver Freisetzung von NO und TNF-α. Die intrazerebrale Injektion von α-Syn PF rostral der Substantia Nigra pars compacta (SNc) von adulten Ratten fuhrte zur profunden Aktivierung von Mikrogliazellen und zum Verlust von dopaminergen Nigraneuronen. Dieser neuronale Zellverlust konnte durch den antiinflammtorischen Wirkstoff und MAP-Kinase Inhibitor Semapimod reduziert werden.\r\nEine Beteiligung von Mikrogliazellen im Rahmen neurodegenerativer Erkrankungen und unterschiedlichen ZNS-Lasionen konnte durch verschiedene Studien belegt werden. Dabei bleibt unklar, ob die Mikrogliareaktion zum neuronalen Schaden beitragt, ob die Zellen eventuell den neuronalen Schaden begrenzen und so regenerativen Einfluss haben oder aber erst nach Untergang der Neurone aktiviert werden. Durch die Freisetzung von neurotoxischen Faktoren konnen sie im Sinne einer inadaquaten Abwehrreaktion die umgebenden Zellen schadigen. \r\nZusammenfassend lasst sich sagen, dass die erhohte Expressionsdichte der mikroglialen PBR eine Basis fur weitere Untersuchungen zur funktionellen Bedeutung der Mikrogliareaktion auf einen neuronalen Schaden darstellt. Diese Untersuchungen mussen therapeutische Strategien uberprufen, die das Konzept vom circulus vitiosus aus neuronalem Zelltod - Neuroinflammation - neuronalem Zelltod anvisieren.",

Fatigue was noted by James Parkinson in his original 1817 description, but studies on its prevalence, progression and impact only started in the late 1990s. In health, fatigue is a transient phenomenon due to exertion, but pathological fatigue is chronic, brought on by no or minimal exertion, does not fully improve with rest and causes disability. Pathological fatigue may arise in otherwise healthy individuals but is most frequently associated with disease states, either as a primary or secondary manifestation. This chapter offers a full description of fatigue in PD, including its pathophysiology, measurement and treatment. along with future directions for research and therapy.",

      "abstract": "With an estimated prevalence of 20 to 40%, cognitive impairment and dementia are common in Parkinson's disease (PD). The relative risk for incident dementia has ranged from 1.7 to 5.9 when compared with age-matched controls without PD. Postmortem studies have not found distinct associations between PD, PD with dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies, and Alzheimer's disease. The varying syndromes may represent a spectrum, where individuals exhibit differences in the type, sequence, or time-course of degeneration of neuronal circuits. Dementia in PD is clinically associated most frequently with older age and more severe motor symptoms, which may have a combined effect.Environmental and genetic risk factors have been proposed, but they have yet to be demonstrated consistently. Early features of dementia in PD are executive dysfunction, impaired verbal fluency, and visuospatial disturbances, making it clinically distinct from Alzheimer's disease. As memory impairment is a late phenomenon, cognitive impairment may be advanced before dementia is diagnosed. Depression, medication-induced psychosis, and apathy are more common in cognitively impaired individuals and may herald dementia. Dementia in PD is an independent risk factor for morbidity and mortality, and treatment should begin with the reduction or elimination of anticholinergic medications and amantadine, followed by the reduction of dopaminergic medications. Cholinesterase inhibitors may help to preserve function in the early and moderate stages. Effects of deep-brain stimulators (DBS) on cognitive decline are not yet well-understood, and further research is needed.",

The immunological etiology is assumed. In diagnostics estimation of level of the antionconeuronal antibodies may be helpful. Mental disorders in the course of paraneoplastic syndrome may coexist with neoplasm, but also may precede it (combined with neurological signs or without them). Such mental disorders have diverse clinical pictures and often are characterized by atypical and heavy course. Observed psychopathological symptoms do not form any specific diagnostic profile delineated in ICD 10 and encompass disturbances of consciousness, perception and thinking, as well as affective states. Although psychiatric intervention in paraneoplastic syndromes with psychopathological symptoms is merely symptomatic, one can still expect atypical response. Suspected paraneoplastic syndrome in patients not yet diagnosed as having neoplasm should persuade one to initiate a screening for potential focal change and to introduce targeted treatment should tumor growth be confirmed.",

      "title": "Neurochemical Alterations in Parkinson's Disease",
      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common idiopathic neurodegenerative disorder, and millions of people around the world have been diagnosed with it. PD is characterized by tremor, bradykinesia, muscle rigidity, impaired gait, and posture. The trademark pathology of PD includes dopaminergic neuronal loss in the substantia nigra pars compacta and depletion of dopamine levels in the striatum. This leads to a perplexing array of clinical features whose identification and management can be challenging for even the most perceptive clinician. The core clinical complex of PD constitutes the four cardinal signs of tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, and loss of postural reflexes. A variety of additional motor features develop in PD, in addition to these cardinal signs. In recent times, it has been recognized that a number of non-motor features also describe PD. The occurrence of these non-motor features may actually precede the development of the classic motor features. Our understanding of PD has expanded at all levels since its description two centuries ago, from the explanation of its clinical phenotype to the identification of its neuropathological features, neurochemical processes and genetic factors. PD pathophysiology can be abstracted at many levels, including molecular pathogenesis, cellular abnormalities, neurochemical variations, site and circuit dysfunction, and dysfunction of the network. With the tremendous advancements in our understanding of these processes it is evident that an ever-expanding wealth of information will continue to emerge and contribute to the development of better treatment approaches for the management of PD. This chapter aims to discuss primarily the neurochemical changes occurring in PD, highlighting the various neurotransmitters involved in the pathophysiology of the disease, along with their receptors and actions. The chapter also covers the dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic pathways involved and how their imbalance contributes to the occurrence of the disease symptoms. Furthermore, the chapter gives an insight into the latest developments and challenges in the treatment of PD.",

      "title": "Postural instability in Parkinson’s disease: the adrenergic hypothesis and the locus coeruleus",
      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is traditionally viewed as a mainly hypodopaminergic syndrome, with symptoms resulting predominantly from loss of dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra. However, while most of the cardinal motor features of PD respond well to dopaminergic therapy, many other features of the disease do not. Balance impairment and the associated risk of falling represent one of the most prominent and potentially disabling features that are typically refractory to dopaminergic treatment. Therefore, it is possible that lesions in nondopaminergic systems contribute to the pathophysiology of postural instability in PD. Such nondopaminergic lesions are well recognized, certainly in advanced stages of PD where postural instability and falls dominate the clinical presentation. However, it remains unclear which of the identified nondopaminergic lesions is specifically responsible for postural instability and balance impairment. In this review, we argue that cell loss in the locus coeruleus and a resultant central norepinephrine deficit are intimately involved in the pathophysiology of postural instability in PD. If proven to be correct, this link between defective noradrenergic neurotransmission and postural instability could have important implications for the future development of new symptomatic treatments aimed to correct postural instability and preventing falls. Studies in the next 5 years could test this hypothesis, using a battery of complementary research techniques, including advanced neuroimaging (structural, functional imaging and nuclear), neurochemical studies of cerebrospinal fluid, post-mortem clinicopathological analyses and detailed clinical balance evaluations supplemented by posturography studies.",

Disease treatment is modified accordingly with the progression of the disease. The present study was carried out to understand the symptoms reported by PD subjects in different phases of the disease.&#x0D; &#x0D; Materials and Methods: Demographic and clinical details were obtained using questionnaires to evaluate the frequency and severity of various motor and nonmotor symptoms experienced by the PD subjects.&#x0D; &#x0D; Results: Ageing was strongly associated with the onset of disease, whereas the BMI category adversely correlated with other motor symptoms (OMS), nonmotor symptoms (NMS), and specifically gastrointestinal symptoms. Tremors were the most troublesome cardinal motor symptoms, followed by stiffness and bradykinesia. The most common NMS were fatigue/tiredness, anxiety/depression, insomnia, constipation, and cognitive impairment. Anxiety and depression were positively associated with other NMS symptoms such as insomnia, fatigue and exhaustion, apathy, and gastrointestinal problems. More than half of our patients reported gastrointestinal discomfort, early satiety, appetite decrease, and bloating. In our present investigation, the most common gastrointestinal symptoms linked with constipation were straining evacuation, lumpy hard stool, and incomplete evacuation.&#x0D; &#x0D; Conclusion: We have analysed the frequency and trend of various symptoms associated with PD in an Indian population from Karnataka. A significant correlation exists between motor and nonmotor symptoms, which impacts the quality of life in PD during the course of the disease.",

      "title": "The Coupling between Brain Connectivity and Heartbeat Dynamics Unveils the Altered Interoceptive Mechanisms in Parkinson's Disease",
      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is often known for its classical motor symptoms, but non-motor symptoms are often reported including interoceptive and autonomic dysfunctions. Autonomic dysfunctions, such as cardiovascular, urinary, or thermoregulatory abnormalities, are more prone to be associated with motor and cognitive decline, as well as increase the risk of mortality. More recent evidence has shown that Parkinsonian patients may experience alterations in interoceptive processing, i.e., reduced sensitivity to accurately sensing and interpreting internal cues, leading to further impairment in self-awareness, cognitive and emotional processing. Noteworthy, the mechanisms behind these autonomic/interoceptive dysfunctions are not well understood. During the early stages of PD, disruptions in the connectivity of multiple brain regions occur, which has prompted the study of PD as a network-level phenomenon. Our hypothesis is that by examining the relationship between brain connectivity and heartbeat dynamics, we can gain insight into the large-scale network disruptions and the neurophysiology of the disrupted interoceptive mechanisms in PD. Our results show that the coupling of fluctuating alpha and gamma connectivity with heartbeat dynamics is reduced in PD patients, as compared to healthy participants. Furthermore, we show that PD patients under dopamine medication recover part of the brain-heart coupling, in proportion with the reduced motor symptoms. Our proposal offers a promising approach to unveil the physiopathology of PD and promoting the development of new diagnostic methods for the early stages of the disease.",

Insomnia is associated with many other medical problems ranging from depression to any issue that causes physical discomfort or pain. Insomnia may be associated with a specific set of environmental conditions or a chronic and unremitting problem that is either primary or associated with another medical problem. Treatment of an associated medical problem like pain improves sleep in some but not all cases. Conversely, treatment for insomnia may improve other medical outcomes. Primary insomnia seems to be related to inability to down regulate arousal and is frequently characterized by increased metabolic rate, heart rate, or other physiological markers. Some research has shown that insomnia may therefore be related to the development of hypertension and other disorders related to physiological arousal. Relatively little work has linked nutrition with insomnia. Beyond associations between caffeine or stimulant use and poor sleep, there is limited work linking poor nutrition with poor sleep and improved nutrition with better sleep.",

      "abstract": "A variety of phenomena might be considered as reflecting impaired insight in psychosis, like failure to recognize signs, symptoms or disease, failure to derive appropriate cognitive representations, despite recognition of the disease, and misattribution of the source or cause of the disease. The unawareness of tardive dyskinesia symptoms in schizophrenic patients points that self-awareness deficits in schizophrenia may be domain specific. Poor insight is an independent phenomenological and a prevalent feature in psychotic disorders in general, and in schizophrenia in particular, but we don't know yet if delusions in schizophrenia are the result of an entirely normal attempt to account for abnormal perceptual experiences or a product of abnormal experience but of normal reasoning. The theoretical approaches regarding impaired insight include the disturbed perceptual input, the impaired linkage between thought and emotion and the breakdown of the process of self-monitoring and error checking. The inability to distinguish between internally and externally generated mental events has been described by the metarepresentation theory. This theory includes the awareness of ones' goals, which leads to disorders of willed action, the awareness of intention, which leads to movement disorders, and the awareness of intentions of others, which leads to paranoid delusions. The theory of metarepresentation implies mainly output mechanisms, like the frontal cortex, while the input mechanism implies posterior brain systems, including the parietal lobe. There are many similarities between the disturbances of awareness seen in schizophrenia and those seen as a result of known neurological impairment. Neuropsychological models of impaired insight typically attribute the disturbance to any of a variety of core deficits in the processing of information. In this respect, lack of insight is on conceptual par with alogia, apraxia or aphasia in reflecting disturbed cognitive processing. In this direction, research have implicated the role of self-monitoring in disorders of awareness and many of the core symptoms of schizophrenia, and has been suggested that these symptoms are the result of a disturbance of a medial frontal system involving anterior hippocampus, cingulated gyrus, supplementary motor area, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Poor insight seems to be something more than a symptom or an epi-phenomenon and its mechanism may constitute a core factor into the psychosis process. Also, poor insight would be involves a common mechanism for many other mental disorders or even it would be an independent and trans-diagnostic factor into the human personality, probably like the dimension of psychotism.",

      "abstract": "About one third of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) experience hallucinations, mostly of a complex visual type, less often auditory or tactile. Minor hallucinatory phenomena, including sense of presence, passage hallucinations and visual illusions are frequent. Hallucinations primarily occur in a context of clear sensorium in patients with longstanding PD. They are more frequent in the evening or during the night. Insight in the hallucinatory nature of the phenomenon may be retained, partial, fluctuating, or abolished. An altered insight is common when cognitive impairment is present, and may be associated with delusions and (or) delusional misidentifications. Pharmacological factors such as dopaminergic treatment clearly trigger or increase the occurence of hallucinations in PD. However, in the recent years, emphasis has been made on disease-related factors including cognitive impairment, diurnal somnolence, visual disorders (either contrast and color discrimination impairment due to PD, or coincident ocular disorders), long duration of PD, late onset, severe axial impairment and autonomic dysfunction. The pathophysiology of hallucinations of PD is poorly understood but is likely to be multifactorial. The first steps of the treatment consist in giving information and reassurance to the patient and his/her caregiver, re-evaluating the antiparkinsonian treatment and associated medications, and evaluating the patient for mood disorder, visual impairment, and cognitive impairment. Cholinesterase inhibitors, when prescribed for associated cognitive impairment, may be beneficial on hallucinations. In the more severe forms, clozapine has been proved to be safe and effective.",

      "abstract": "The pathology of Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by the presence of neuronal loss, Lewy bodies (LBs), and Lewy neurites (LNs) at predilection sites in the nervous system. During the course of PD a characteristic pattern of lesions develops in both the central and peripheral nervous system, with a predominant involvement of ‘efferent’ subcortical structures such as the substantia nigra and amygdala. ‘Afferent’ cortical structures such as the entorhinal region are frequently involved in Alzheimer-type pathology. In this chapter the clinical features and postmortem findings of 33 patients with PD are reviewed and compared, with special attention being paid to the frequent but not exclusive association of LBs/LNs with Alzheimer-type pathology. Although a clear relationship between the neuropathological findings and the clinical features of psychopathology and/or dementia could not be observed, one could speculate that the Parkinson-specific lesions in cortical and subcortical structures and the Alzheimer-type pathology, which is seen most often in the entorhinal region, reinforce each other and thus are responsible for the development of dementia in PD. CA2 ubiquitin-immunoreactive neurites were found in almost all patients with PD and should be considered a normal finding in PD, irrespective of whether or not the patient is demented.",

This disease is chronic and progressive in neurodegeneration causing dopaminergic neurons in Substantia nigra region of the mid brain to die which ultimately leads to decrease in dopamine production in our brain. Though any direct cause of this disease has not been identified yet, but many genetic mutations and environmental factors are found to be related to it. The diagnosis depends on family genetic history and disease symptoms.

People who have long-term medical issues, on the other hand are more than twice as likely to be depressed and anxiety as the general population. The goal of the research is to better understand the impact of mental illness on the body. This disease has social consequences in terms of diminished efficiency and increased health-care utilization. The first step is to comprehend the relationship between the mind and the body in devising treatments to reduce the occurrence of co-existing diseases and treat those who do have mental illnesses and chronic physical difficulties and . Depression can be accompanied by practically any other mental or physical ailment. Physical illness increases the likelihood of developing a major type of depression. At work, there are two separate processes. The one that stands out the most is based on psychological or cognitive issues. As a result, due to a life event or persistent struggle, the disease might be the spark for a depressive episode in a handicapped person. Second, there are more complicated relationships between depression and certain health disorders. In terms of etiology, they might be very intriguing. Stroke and coronary disease are perhaps the best examples. Finally, severe depression, but particularly minor depression, dysthymia, and depressive symptoms, which patients present to their physicians, merge with other signs of human distress. Such somatic manifestations put the traditional distinction between physical and mental illness to the test, and they are a perennial subject of debate.

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is manifested clinically by bradykinesia, muscular rigidity, and sometimes rest tremor. The pathological hallmark of PD is the degeneration of dopaminergic cells within the substantia nigra-pars compacta (SNc) and the subsequent dopamine depletion of the striatum. Besides disturbances in motor performance, other symptoms like REM sleep behavior disorder, autonomic dysfunction, depression, and cognitive deficits can play a role in PD. It can be difficult to distinguish PD from other neurodegenerative brain diseases, but early diagnosis is important because prognosis and treatment options differ. Structural imaging is in general not helpful at early disease stages. However, nuclear imaging methods not only can display striatal dopaminergic activity in PD but also visualize brain perfusion and glucose metabolism to show disease-related changes in local brain function or identify cholinergic deficits associated with cognitive dysfunction. Presynaptic dopaminergic imaging either with PET or SPECT is the gold standard to differentiate between patients with parkinsonian features associated with and without a presynaptic dopaminergic deficit. In order to differentiate between PD and other neurodegenerative brain diseases, specific disease-related metabolic patterns identified with FDG-PET imaging could be of great assistance in the individual clinical diagnosis.",

The severity of impairment and the variety of symptoms associated with neurodevelopmental disorders or with particular epilepsy syndromes reflect focal or global, structural or functional dysfunction of neuronal networks. The complex relationship between neurodevelopmental disorders and epilepsy is secondary to common factors that include genetics, cognition, motor and language function. The epileptic encephalopathies are associated with regression or slowing of cognitive, language or behavior and the accepted working hypothesis is that this is a direct consequence of the seizures or of the interictal epileptiform activity, as opposed to the associated medical condition. The evidence that recurrent seizures or abnormal electrical activity can cause specific cognitive, language or behavioral abnormalities even in accepted epileptic encephalopathies is still controversial. Data from animal studies and the clinical experience from epileptic encephalopathies of early life imply that there are developmental time windows crucial to the type of epilepsy syndrome and to cognitive and behavioral outcome.The management of children in whom a neurodevelopmental disorder coexists with epilepsy is a difficult problem that requires a multidisciplinary approach that addresses both the epilepsy and the specific cognitive or behavioral problem and is tailored to the needs of the individual child.",

      "title": "20 Laterality of Motor Symptom Onset is Not Associated with Cognitive Performance or Mood Symptoms in a Sample of 600 Individuals with Idiopathic Parkinson’s Disease”",
      "abstract": "Objective: Parkinson’s disease (PD) is typically characterized by unilateral onset of motor symptoms (i.e., tremors, rigidity) which is caused by dopaminergic degeneration of the substantia nigra that influences basal ganglia-prefrontal circuitry. Over time, motor symptoms become more bilateral, though continue to remain asymmetric. Many neuropsychological studies suggest that laterality of motor onset may be linked to hemispheric specific cognitive or mood changes. Namely, worse verbal/language performance may be present in individuals with right body (left hemisphere) onset and conversely for visuospatial performance, with depression symptoms relating more so to individuals with right body (left hemisphere) onset. To date, findings are often inconsistent, with some studies showing evidence for laterality effects and others not. The basis for this inconsistency is unclear, though one possibility relates to small sample sizes and varying methodologies. Thus, the goal of this study was to examine potential cognitive and mood laterality effects in a large clinical sample of individuals with PD. Participants and Methods: Participants included a convenience sample of 600 nondemented individuals with idiopathic PD from the University of Florida Fixel Institute Movement Disorders Center. As a group, participants were around 60 years of age (Mean Age=63.9+9.4), well educated (Mean years=14.9+2.7), predominantly male (70%), and white non-Hispanic (93%). Side of initial motor symptom onset was based on self-report: Right (N=337) and Left (N=263). Approximately 79% were tremor predominant. All received mood and neurocognitive measures as part of standard clinical care, including indices of executive function (Stroop Color-Word, Trails B, Letter Fluency), recent verbal memory (delayed recall: Hopkin’s Verbal Learning Test, WMS-III Logical Memory), language (Boston Naming Test, Animal fluency), visuospatial skills (Judgment of Line Orientation, Facial Recognition Test). Evaluation of emotion symptoms included: depression (Beck Depression Inventory-II), apathy (Apathy Scale), and anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory). Analyses used raw scores from these measures. Due to non-normality of most measures’ distributions, laterality effects were examined using bootstrapped multivariate methods (multivariate analysis of variance [MANOVA]). Separate MANOVA’s were run for each cognitive domain (i.e., EF, language, etc.) and mood measures. Results: The right and left sided onset groups did not significantly differ in demographic (age, education, sex) or disease characteristics (duration, PD subtype). Results of the MANOVA’s with cognitive variables were all nonsignificant broadly (all with F’s ranging from .33 to .94) and at the single test level. Similarly, the left and right onset groups did not significantly differ (a=0.05) across standard scales of depression (F=0.031), anxiety (Trait F=0.463; State F=3.29), and apathy (F=0.74). Conclusions: We found no evidence that laterality of initial motor symptoms influenced cognitive or mood symptoms in a large cohort of 600 individuals with PD. These findings raise questions about importance of motor onset laterality for cognitive and emotion related changes in PD. Future studies should move beyond self-report and behavioral motor scales for determining hemispheric contributions. In PD, use of refined metrics for determining the extent of asymmetric dopaminergic degeneration (e.g., DAT scan) at the hemispheric level coupled with sensitive neuropsychological measures may provide clearer understanding of potential neural circuitry relationships.",

      "title": "Assessment of the heart rate variability in Parkinson's disease",
      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a chronic neurodegenerative disorder, second in frequency only to Alzheimer's disease. Although the well-acknowledged motor symptoms dominated the clinical scenario for a long time, people with a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease typically disclose several life-debilitating non-motor symptoms, even at the early stages of the disorder. Furthermore, typical antiparkinsonian medications such as levodopa also proved to affect the non-motor manifestations, inducing them to fluctuate during the day. The non-motor signs include autonomic symptoms that are addressed to neuronal damages in the autonomic nervous system. Among them, cardiovascular dysautonomia, caused by the loss of sympathetic and parasympathetic innervation throughout the heart, has been reported to precede the motor stage and to progress in parallel with the disease. An accurate recognition and monitoring of the non-motor manifestation remain challenging and less obvious than motor assessment. Current approaches are mainly based on questionnaires and self-reports, lacking objectivity. The heart rate variability signal (HRV) has proved to be a feasible and non-invasive instrument to assess cardiac autonomic dysregulation. The spectral analysis of the HRV allows a deeper comprehension of the complementary sympathetic and parasympathetic influences on the sino-atrial (SA) node, thus picturing the cardiac autonomic outflow. Particularly, the high-frequency (HF) component (0.15-0.4 Hz) of the power spectrum has been reported as a hallmark of vagal activity. This thesis is part of the BlueSky Project and aims in assessing the heart response in advanced Parkinson's patients under levodopa. For this purpose, data collected in the Motion Analysis Lab (Boston, MA) on 26 affected subjects have been analyzed. Patients have been first monitored in a supervised setting over a full medication cycle, starting from the Off state, moving to the On condition, and then turning back Off. Next, they have been tracked in a simulated home environment. Electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings have first been segmented to isolate periods of relaxation and then processed with a QRS complexes-detection algorithm applied on the wavelet transform to extract the ECG peaks. Resulting R waves have been carefully inspected and corrected to remove occasional ectopic or erroneous beats. R events have been modeled as a history-dependent inverse Gaussian distribution by a point-process method able to reflect the stochastic nature of the heartbeat occurrences and the influences of the autonomic divisions on the SA node. The HF content has been obtained from the point-process algorithm spectral analysis and interpreted as a marker of parasympathetic activation. HF-HRV of Parkinson's subjects has first been compared with HF-HRV of age-matched healthy controls, then longitudinally monitored over the medication cycle to investigate the levodopa effects. Parkinson's patients displayed a lower HF-HRV when compared with healthy controls, denoting a suppressed parasympathetic activation consistent with the previous literature. Furthermore, HRV parameters monitored during the medication cycle differed before and after the medication intake. The mean RR intervals and HF-HRV exhibited significant decreases (p = 0.0108 and p = 0.0003, respectively) in subjects shifting from Off to On, suggesting an additional depressor effect on the vagal modulation of the heart due to levodopa.",

In PD, cognitive disorders can manifest themselves in the form of a decrease in executive, visual, and visuospatial activity and memory impairment from mild to severe dementia. Cognitive impairments of a subjective and objective nature are often found at the level of early and mild manifestations. In such situations, it is important to develop a strategy for predicting the progression of cognitive disorders and developing methods for their prevention. Long-term and multicenter studies conducted over the past 30-40 years have shown that after the diagnosis of PD, dementia develops after ten courses of the underlying disease. This, in turn, aggravates the already complex course of PD with a pronounced decrease in the quality of life of patients.",

The contemporary criteria for diagnosis of PSP indicate akinesia, oculomotor dysfunction, postural instability, and language/cognitive impairment as core symptoms.

PSP-P is the second most common subtype of PSP, following PSP-Richardson's syndrome (PSP-RS), and is associated with a more gradual deterioration, beneficial course, and longer life expectancy after diagnosis. It is also problematic in terms of clinical evaluation, as this entity may overlap with Parkinson's disease (PD) in early stages and with other atypical Parkinsonisms in more advanced stages. The evolution in understanding PSP and the possible progress in care and therapy of the disease leads to the necessity of finding optimal examination methods with sufficient sensitivity and specificity. In this context, PSP-P seems a crucial point.

Cognitive impairment of Parkinson's disease is also prevalent and has great impact on daily living of patients. Hypoperfusion caused by orthostatic hypoperfusion can contribute cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease. To know the correlation between orthostatic hypotension and cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease, this study has been done in the drug-naïve patients without dementia. We studied 45 patients with no prior history of treatment for Parkinson's disease. All the patients were evaluated for orthostatic hypotension before they started taking medication for Parkinson's disease. Orthostatic hypotension was defined as a status where systolic blood pressure dropped more than 20 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure more than 10 mmHg. The co-morbid medical conditions that could affect blood pressure were also recorded. The severity of motor symptoms was measured using Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scales and Hoehn and Yahr Stage. Autonomic symptoms were evaluated with a structured questionnaire. A neuropsychological evaluation was performed using the Seoul Neuropsychological Screening Battery and the Korean version of Mini-mental Status Examination. Orthostatic hypotension was prevalent. Eighteen patients (40%) showed orthostatic hypotension (OH group), and twenty-seven (60%) did not (normotensive group). There was no difference in demographic and clinical characteristics between the two groups. Symptoms of autonomic dysfunctions in OH group were also not different from those in normotensive group. For the neuropsychological tests, the abnormal items were more common in OH group but the difference was insignificant. However, the verbal memory as shown by recognition task was more significantly impaired in OH group than in normotensive group. When the co-morbid medical conditions were excluded, there was a trend that the verbal memory was more decreased in OH group, but it did not reach statistical significance. Orthostatic hypotension was prevalent even in the early stage of Parkinson's disease. Patient with orthostatic hypotension showed more impairment in some cognitive tasks. Our findings suggest that there be a correlation between orthostatic hypotension and cognitive impairment.",

This has to do with accelerated loss of dopaminergic neurons, or dampened synthesis and release of dopamine, or dysfunction of dopamine receptors. The disease is relatively easy to diagnose owing to well recognized classical symptoms. The symptoms are of motor and non-motor character. The former consist of tremors, disorders of gait and balance, frequent falls, and most notably muscle rigidity and stiffness that cause a characteristic flexed walking posture. The latter consist of sensory and cognitive deficits. So far little attention has been paid to respiratory disorders. These disorders may be counted as belonging to yet another category – premotor disorders, since they are concerned with changes in premotor neurons setting central respiratory activity running down to spinal motor neurons moving the diaphragm. There are two possible reasons of respiratory changes in parkinsonism: stiffness of the chest, mechanically obstructing respiratory movements, and the lack of dopamine which is influential in facilitating respiration at the central level, albeit the issue of the dopamine role in respiration is complex and contentious. Impaired lung ventilation causes hypoxemia, which is the cause of further deterioration of bodily functions. Recognition of ventilatory changes in parkinsonism is, therefore, of practical therapeutic importance. In this study we set out to examine lung ventilation in an experimental model of parkinsonism induced by reserpine plus alpha-methyltyrosine in rats. Ventilation was recorded in a rodent plethysmograph in conscious unrestrained animals. We found that resting ventilation and the stimulatory ventilatory responses to hypoxia (8% O2 in N2) were significantly depressed in parkinsonic rats, as compared with healthy untreated ones. The findings, in all likelihood, reflect the missing stimulatory influence of central dopamine on ventilation, which underlines the development of parkinsonic symptoms.The study points attention to the possibility of ventilatory depression as a sequel of parkinsonism. The corollary is that breathing exercise, by improving lung ventilation and in consequence delivery of oxygen to the arterial blood, could be of value in enhancing the effects of other treatment modalities. Breathing exercise could also enhance cognitive abilities, particularly in older age.Breathing exercise should become part of the comprehensive physical rehabilitation program for elderly patients. Such a program, consisting of exercise, proper nutrition, social activity, home oxygen therapy, and psychosocial support has been developed in Japan (Comprehensive Pulmonary Rehabilitation: Manual for Team Approach. Edited by K. Kida. Medical Review Co. Tokyo, Japan, 1995). The program is now advocated also in patients suffering from neurodegenerative brain conditions, including Parkinson’s disease. Particularly, home oxygen therapy, combined with breathing exercises, is noteworthy, as it holds an obviously greater potential to improve tissue oxygenation, exercise capacity, and patients’ quality of life.",

Da derartige „benigne“ Wahrnehmungsstörungen bei der Parkinson-Erkrankung allerdings mit einer hohen Inzidenz schwerer psychotischer Störungen im weiteren Krankheitsverlauf assoziiert sind, sollte frühzeitig eine medikamentöse Therapie in Betracht gezogen werden. Neben Clozapin können in Abhängigkeit von den Begleitumständen auch Quetiapin, Benzodiazepine und Cholinesterase-Inhibitoren zur Behandlung von Halluzinationen in Frage kommen.",

      "title": "Investigation of the Effects of SIRT1 and SIRT2 Modulators in Neuroinflammatory Models of Depression",
      "abstract": "Depression is regarded as a manifestation of mood disorder and a complex phenomenon. The etiology can be primary and/or secondary to organic diseases. Neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease and multiple sclerosis are often accompanied by the development of depression. A high prevalence of depression in populations with neurodegenerative diseases also indicates a close relationship between depression and neurodegeneration. There are several hypotheses of the pathogenesis of depression, including monoamine hypothesis, neurotrophic and the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) hypothesis, HPA axis theory and circadian rhythm theory. There are apparently no infectious insults in the initiation of depression. However, depressed patients without apparent physical diseases showed an increased level of inflammatory markers. Evidence has indicated that neuroinflammation participates in the genesis and development of depression and interacts with other factors involved in depression. Excessive inflammatory cytokines can reduce the production of serotonin, fuel glutamate excitotoxicity, disturb neural plasticity, reduce the production of brain-derived neurotrophic factor and eventually prime the brain for neurodegeneration by facilitating inflammation and synaptic damage.\nThe target of current commercially available antidepressants is to increase levels of neurotransmitters including serotonin, noradrenaline and/or dopamine via different therapeutic mechanisms. However, the overall remission rate for the present medication options is under 30% according to the result of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)-funded sequenced treatment alternatives to relieve depression (STAR*D) study. Additionally, they are frequently accompanied by undesirable side-effects and toxic effects in overdoses that limit their application. Therefore, there is an ongoing need to investigate the potential for novel medications that target neuroinflammation to address this underlying feature of depression.\nSirtuins are a unique class of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent deacetylases that can affect multiple downstream targets by deacetylation activity. The sirtuin family consists of SIRT1-7 enzymes that differ in subcellular localization, enzymatic activities, physiological functions and pathological roles. Among these seven members, SIRT1 has been reported to exert neuroprotective effects in aging, oxidative stress, neuronal survival, neurogenesis and neuroinflammation. SIRT2 also participates in numerous aging-related cellular activities including DNA repair, oxidative stress and autophagy. Based on these important roles, the pharmacological effects of SIRT1 and SIRT2 modulators have been investigated in numerous neurodegeneration studies where different models were conducted, and contradictory results were generated. Therefore, this thesis proposed a systematic investigation of the effects of SIRT1 and SIRT2 modulators in neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration models of depression including in vitro and in vivo studies. The pharmacological agents assessed in this study include: SIRT1 activator resveratrol; selective SIRT1 inhibitor EX527; dual SIRT1/SIRT2 inhibitor sirtinol; SIRT2 inhibitor AGK2; and positive controls for depression and inflammation, fluoxetine and ibuprofen, respectively.\nMicroglia are the resident macrophages that are regarded as the prime components of the intrinsic immune system in CNS parenchyma. Therefore, microglia play a dominant role in neuroinflammation. Injury or other pathological insults can result in the activation of microglia which are able to release inflammatory mediators and chemokines such as TNF-α, IL-1β, PGE2 and reactive oxidative species. Thus the overall experimental design was to collect the supernatant from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated microglia (HAPI cell line) and transfer it onto neuronal cells (SH-SY5Y cell line). Microglia were pre-treated with SIRT drugs to affect their biological performance under LPS stimulation and investigate the alteration of the subsequent outcome on neuronal cells.\nTo achieve this goal, methodology development was conducted to optimize the cell culture condition and differentiation method for SH-SY5Y cell line, which is key to achieve accurate results for this study. The glucose level in culture media needed to be correctly selected for the cell culture of SH-SY5Y cells in this supernatant transfer-based co-culture model. High glucose in culture media is considered a pre-diabetic condition for neurons. Data has shown that the cell viability of high-glucose cultured SH-SY5Y cells was reduced by treatment of HAPI cells-conditioned supernatant, which indicated the existence of low-glucose shock. Whereas, application of low-glucose media can effectively prevent SH-SY5Y cells from low-glucose shock after the treatment of the supernatant collected from HAPI cells. Moreover, the differentiation method for SH-SY5Y was also optimized. The combination induction treatment of retinoic acid and BDNF can successfully differentiate the SH-SY5Y cells morphologically and genetically. The RNA expression of neuronal gene marker synaptophysin (SYP) and enolase 2 (ENO2) have shown to significantly increase after combination treatment of retinoic acid and BDNF.\nIn the in vitro pharmacological study, the effects of these SIRT1 and SIRT2 drugs on the production of inflammatory mediators including PGE2, TNF-α, IL-1β and IL-10 on LPS (0.005 μg/L) -stimulated microglia were assessed. Resveratrol and sirtinol significantly reduced the TNF-α production in HAPI cells by up to 95% and 93% respectively. This result showed their potent inhibiting effects on TNF-α which can initiate cell death pathways by binding TNF receptors. Resveratrol, sirtinol, EX527 and AGK2 also significantly reduced PGE2 production by up to 97%, 100%, 65% and 69% respectively in microglia under LPS stimulation. These results are significant given that prostaglandins contribute to prolonged acute inflammatory responses.\nThe supernatant from LPS-stimulated HAPI cells was transferred to SH-SY5Y cells. All SIRT drugs pre-treated of HAPI cells were shown to significantly increase the survival of undifferentiated SH-SY5Y cells, following the transfer of the supernatant. Their inhibiting effects on the production of inflammatory mediators including TNF-α and PGE2 might contribute to this protection on SH-SY5Y cells. The SIRT1 activator resveratrol and dual SIRT1/SIRT2 inhibitor sirtinol demonstrated the most potent effect compared to others. Additionally, in undifferentiated cells, resveratrol was protective against apoptosis, as indicated by a reduction in Caspase 3/7 activity. However, in contrast, in differentiated SH-SY5Y cells, only sirtinol and AGK2 pre-treated supernatant were found to exert neuroprotective effects. Moreover, no increase in Caspase 3 activity was observed following treatment with supernatant indicating that protection against apoptosis is not the reason for increased cell survival.\nIn the animal study, the two most effective agents, SIRT1 activator resveratrol and dual SIRT1/2 inhibitor sirtinol, from the in vitro study were assessed in the acute phase of the LPS-induced depression mouse model and compared with fluoxetine. The behavioral parameters including locomotor activity and immobility time in the open field test, forced swim test and tail suspension test were significantly improved by resveratrol, sirtinol and fluoxetine in the acute sickness phase of the depression model.\nIn conclusion, this research has emphasized the necessity of increasing the understanding of the roles that neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration playing in the pathophysiology of depression and the importance of investigating SIRT drugs as a novel class of drugs targeting neuroinflammation. This research has shown the effectiveness of SIRT modulators in inhibiting neuroinflammation and subsequent neurodegeneration through in vitro and in vivo studies. Further studies, including combining SIRT modulators and current antidepressant medications are warranted.",

Although exact clinico-pathological correlations have not been established, α-synuclein pathology with Lewy body formation in the central and peripheral autonomic nervous system as well as in neocortical areas are generally believed to be driving factors for autonomic failure and cognitive decline in PD. Recent pathological and clinical studies have suggested greater prevalence of clinical dysautonomia and cardiac sympathetic denervation in PD dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies as compared with PD without dementia. This raises the possibility that spread of synuclein pathology to involve neocortical areas producing cognitive decline could be somehow linked to involvement of the autonomic nervous system in PD. © 2007 Movement Disorder Society",

The age of onset may be helpful in deciding on the aetiology, but many of the causes of dementia are found in both age groups, making this traditional approach to classification relatively redundant. A dementia may develop in the course of established Parkinson's disease. Alcohol is known to be neurotoxic, but the existence of 'alcoholic dementia' as a distinct entity is doubtful.

Relatively little attention has been directed toward small intestinal dysfunction in PD, but some evidence has accumulated that small intestinal motility may, indeed, be impaired in PD. However, the clinical consequences of any such dysfunction have not been clearly delineated. Much more information is available regarding colonic and anorectal dysfunction in PD. Diminished bowel movement frequency, presumably reflecting colonic dysmotility with consequent slowed colonic transit, is present in a significant percentage of individuals with PD, reported figures ranging from 20 to 77%. Anorectal dysfunction, characterized by both excessive straining and a sense of incomplete emptying, develops even more frequently in PD, affecting more than 60% of patients. Both central and enteric nervous system dysfunction may have a role in the generation of these intestinal and anorectal abnormalities. Recognition of two components of intestinal dysfunction in PD—slow-transit constipation and anorectal defecatory dysfunction—will hopefully open the therapeutic door to more specific and effective treatment for these troubling and occasionally disabling features of PD.",

      "title": "Behavioral Tests in Neurotoxin-Induced Animal Models of Parkinson’s Disease",
      "abstract": "Currently, neurodegenerative diseases are a major cause of disability around the world. Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second-leading cause of neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer’s disease. In PD, continuous loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra causes dopamine depletion in the striatum, promotes the primary motor symptoms of resting tremor, bradykinesia, muscle rigidity, and postural instability. The risk factors of PD comprise environmental toxins, drugs, pesticides, brain microtrauma, focal cerebrovascular injury, aging, and hereditary defects. The pathologic features of PD include impaired protein homeostasis, mitochondrial dysfunction, nitric oxide, and neuroinflammation, but the interaction of these factors contributing to PD is not fully understood. In neurotoxin-induced PD models, neurotoxins, for instance, 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), 1-Methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+), paraquat, rotenone, and permethrin mainly impair the mitochondrial respiratory chain, activate microglia, and generate reactive oxygen species to induce autooxidation and dopaminergic neuronal apoptosis. Since no current treatment can cure PD, using a suitable PD animal model to evaluate PD motor symptoms’ treatment efficacy and identify therapeutic targets and drugs are still needed. Hence, the present review focuses on the latest scientific developments in different neurotoxin-induced PD animal models with their mechanisms of pathogenesis and evaluation methods of PD motor symptoms.",

      "abstract": "La enfermedad de Parkinson es una entidad neurodegenerativa con alteraciones principalmente extrapiramidales, del sistema nervioso autónomo y, en etapas finales, alteraciones cognitivas y neuropsiquiátricas. Desde 1976 se reconocen además síntomas neurosensoriales dependientes del sistema nervioso periférico, presentes en casi la mitad de los pacientes y que preceden incluso a los síntomas motores. Los síntomas sensitivos fueron inicialmente atribuidos a distonías o a niveles indebidos de levodopa en ausencia de medicación apropiada; sin embargo, estudios recientes sugieren una etiología intrínseca a la propia enfermedad. Se reconocen tres formas de presentación: polineuropatía crónica (la más común), aguda y subaguda. La clínica de la polineuropatía es concurrente con la de la enfermedad de Parkinson y el diagnóstico es básicamente clínico, aun cuando se cuenta con el apoyo de la electromiografía y de la velocidad de conducción nerviosa, cuya normalidad no descartaría a esta entidad. El manejo actual está basado en la presunción etiológica, por lo que la reposición de vitaminas como la B12, B1 y folatos puede considerarse como parte del mismo. La etiología, el pronóstico y la fisiopatología son aún temas de debate y requieren, por lo tanto, más investigaciones.",

      "title": "Are patients with Parkinson’s disease blind to blindsight?",
      "abstract": "In Parkinson's disease, visual dysfunction is prominent. Visual hallucinations can be a major hallmark of late stage disease, but numerous visual deficits also occur in early stage Parkinson's disease. Specific retinopathy, deficits in the primary visual pathway and the secondary ventral and dorsal pathways, as well as dysfunction of the attention pathways have all been posited as causes of hallucinations in Parkinson's disease. We present data from patients with Parkinson's disease that contrast with a known neuro-ophthalmological syndrome, termed 'blindsight'. In this syndrome, there is an absence of conscious object identification, but preserved 'guess' of the location of a stimulus, preserved reflexive saccades and motion perception and preserved autonomical and expressive reactions to negative emotional facial expressions. We propose that patients with Parkinson's disease have the converse of blindsight, being 'blind to blindsight'. As such they preserve conscious vision, but show erroneous 'guess' localization of visual stimuli, poor saccades and motion perception, and poor emotional face perception with blunted autonomic reaction. Although a large data set on these deficits in Parkinson's disease has been accumulated, consolidation into one specific syndrome has not been proposed. Focusing on neuropathological and physiological data from two phylogenetically old and subconscious pathways, the retino-colliculo-thalamo-amygdala and the retino-geniculo-extrastriate pathways, we propose that aberrant function of these systems, including pathologically inhibited superior colliculus activity, deficient corollary discharges to the frontal eye fields, dysfunctional pulvinar, claustrum and amygdaloid subnuclei of the amygdala, the latter progressively burdened with Lewy bodies, underlie this syndrome. These network impairments are further corroborated by the concept of the 'silent amygdala'. Functionally being 'blind to blindsight' may facilitate the highly distinctive 'presence' or 'passage' hallucinations of Parkinson's disease and can help to explain handicaps in driving capacities and dysfunctional 'theory of mind'. We propose this synthesis to prompt refined neuropathological and neuroimaging studies on the pivotal nuclei in these pathways in order to better understand the networks underpinning this newly conceptualized syndrome in Parkinson's disease.",

      "abstract": "A esclerose múltipla remitente-recorrente (EMRR) é uma doença neurológica autoimune, onde o sistema imunológico ataca a bainha de mielina do sistema nervoso central, causando inflamação que prejudica a transmissão dos impulsos nervosos. Caracteriza-se por episódios de surtos com exacerbação dos sintomas, como fadiga, fraqueza em membros inferiores e superiores, tremores e equilíbrio dificuldade para andar, perda de visão, entre outros, seguidos de remissões com recuperação parcial ou completa, que podem durar meses ou anos, durante os quais a progressão da doença é mínima ou ausente. A insônia ou baixa qualidade de sono pode ocorrer indiretamente como consequência da EMRR. Ou seja, um sintoma secundário que é acarretado pela presença dos sintomas específicos da doença e dos pseudo surtos. A Percepção Corporal (PC) pode ser definida de duas maneiras, como Imagem Corporal (IC) e Esquema Corporal (EC). A IC está relacionada ao aspecto psíquico, emocional, cognitivo, sociocultural, evolucionário, genético e neurocientífico, em relação a expectativa da imagem de seu corpo. O EC é a perspectiva que possibilita, por meio de mecanismos cinestésicos e proprioceptivos, o reconhecimento do corpo anatômico e da relação que este estabelece com o meio e com os objetos a sua volta. Diante destas definições, surgiu a oportunidade para relacionar a qualidade de sono com a percepção corporal e os quadros sintomatológicos. Sendo assim, o objetivo do estudo foi analisar a relação entre a qualidade do sono e a percepção corporal, pelo aspecto do esquema corporal e os quadros sintomatológicos da esclerose múltipla. Participaram 18 pessoas, entre 21 e 67 anos, que foram avaliados quanto à qualidade do sono pelo questionário de Pittsburgh, à percepção corporal pelo Teste de Askevold, e aos sintomas por meio de uma entrevista estruturada. Os resultados indicaram que todos os participantes com sono adequado foram classificados como hiperesquemáticos, enquanto 67% dos que apresentaram sono inadequado foram classificados como hipoesquemáticos. Além disso, indivíduos com sono inadequado mostraram uma distribuição equilibrada entre sintomas motores e sensitivos, enquanto aqueles com sono adequado relataram predominantemente sintomas sensitivos. A fadiga foi um sintoma relevante em 67% dos indivíduos com sono inadequado. Esses achados sugerem que a qualidade do sono pode estar associada à percepção corporal e à manifestação dos sintomas na EMRR, destacando a importância de intervenções que melhorem o sono para o manejo dessa condição.",

      "abstract": "The mild cognitive impairment (MCI) stage of neurodegenerative diseases refers to an early clinical phase of the disease in which a change has been observed in an individual's cognition or behavior but the person is generally able to maintain independent functioning in daily activities with minimal aids or assistance. At an early stage of most neurodegenerative diseases, including the Frontotemporal Dementias, it can be very difficult to determine whether a person has symptoms of a progressive illness or is suffering from a condition less likely to progress, or even exhibiting symptoms consistent with normal aging. It is critical to identify individuals with MCI, since people with this clinical syndrome are at elevated risk of progressive cognitive decline. In the case of Primary Progressive Aphasia, a neurodegenerative disease in which speech and/or language abilities are gradually lost, a speech-language pathologist (SLP) may be one of the initial clinical providers in the MCI stage. The SLP is therefore critical in helping to determine whether a change in language abilities is a result of normal aging, a neurodegenerative process, or other etiologies.",

Os sintomas motores que a caracterizam sao associacoes entre bradicinesia e instabilidade postural e a presenca do tremor em repouso. Ja os sintomas nao motores, sao caracterizados por incontinencia urinaria, disturbios do sono, constipacao intestinal e principalmente a depressao. A depressao e uma psicopatologia nao motora que pode trazer diversos prejuizos para o paciente idoso conforme estudos, os quais apontam que a depressao tem como uma de suas consequencias o prejuizo da memoria episodica.  Objetivo : Analisar o prejuizo da memoria episodica em idosos deprimidos ou nao com DP.  Metodo:  Trata-se de um estudo transversal, realizado em um ambulatorio de disturbio do movimento em um hospital publico da capital de de Alagoas. A amostra foi composta por 62 idosos de ambos os sexos com idade igual ou superior a 60 anos. Como instrumentos de pesquisa, utilizou-se um questionario estruturado desenvolvido pelos proprios pesquisadores para identificacao socioeconomica dos pacientes (idade, sexo, retinia e outros), Avaliacao Cognitiva Montreal (MoCA), Teste de Aprendizagem Auditivo Verbal de Rey (RAVLT) e Escala de Depressao Geriatrica (GDS-15) versao reduzida. O projeto que originou este trabalho foi aprovado pelo Comite de Etica em Pesquisa-CEP (CAAE: 83020118.6.0000.5641). Resultados:  Os idosos participantes desse estudo apresentaram idade entre 60-78 anos (X= 66,04 anos; DP= 4,09). Houve maioria de individuos do sexo feminino, com 64% e baixa escolaridade (X=6,43 anos; DP= 5,28). Diante da GDS-15, 64,5% dos idosos apresentaram rastreamento positivo para depressao, desses 50% com depressao leve e 15,2% com depressao grave. Quanto a relacao da depressao e o prejuizo da memoria episodica medido pelo teste RAVLT identificou-se resultado estatisticamente significativo (p=0,043) e (p=0,042) no MoCA.  Conclusao:  Diante do que foi apresentado acima, os dados apresentados demostraram consonância com o que vem descrito na literatura no que concerne a relacao da depressao com prejuizo da memoria episodica e declinio cognitivo. Alem disso, a relacao dos sintomas depressivos pode estar vinculada com a maior prevalencia nesta amostra de individuos do sexo feminino, que por sua vez, e considerado fator de risco para sintomas depressivos. Por fim, e possivel identificar que ha consequencias diretas na cognicao dos pacientes com DP diagnosticados com depressao apresentando assim prejuizo na memoria episodica.",

The disorders that are often observed during the night in PD include sleep fragmentation that may be due to recurrent PD symptoms, sleep apnea, Restless Leg Syndrome/periodic limb movements and REM sleep behavior disorder. Excessive daytime sleepiness is also a common occurrence in PD. EDS can arise from several etiologies, and patients may have more than one etiology responsible. The causes of EDS include nocturnal sleep disorder with sleep deprivation and resulting daytime somnolence, the effect of drugs used to treat PD, and possibly neurodegeneration of central sleep/wake areas. Appropriate diagnosis of the sleep disturbance affecting a PD patient can lead to specific treatments that can consolidate nocturnal sleep and enhance daytime alertness.",

      "abstract": "Neuromuscular pathology in the critically ill patient develops within two settings: primary neurological diseases that require admission in the Intensive Care Medicine Unit for close monitoring or mechanical ventilation, and peripheral nervous system manifestations secondary to critical systemic diseases. The most frequent conditions in the first group are Guillain-Barré syndrome and Myasthenia Gravis, and in the second group, polyneuropathy and myopathy of the critically ill patient. The most commonly shared clinical pattern is the development of severe weakness and quadriplegia which most typical manifestation is the need for assisted ventilation and/or weaning difficulty/impossibility. Triggering factors considered are multiorgan failure and sepsis in polyneuropathy, and steroids and neuromuscular blockers in myopathy, with malnutrition, particularly hypoalbuminemia, and hyperglycemia being co-adjuvant in both conditions. Considering that neuropathic and myopathic conditions may frequently coexist, the term polyneuromyopathy of the critically ill patient has been coined. Both Guillain-Barré syndrome and polyneuropathy of the critically ill patient involve peripheral nerves, so that the differential diagnosis has to be made between both. The presenting picture is different, since the former is an acute pathology that motivates ICU admission, whereas the latter is a polyneuropathy acquired during hospitalization. In the former, involvement of the autonomous nervous system and CSF albumin-cytology dissociation are common, which do not occur in polyneuropathy. Electrophysiological studies show demyelinating signs with decreased conduction velocity and normal amplitude of motor potentials in Guillain-Barré syndrome versus normal conduction velocity and reduced amplitude of motor potentials in axonal polyneuropathy. Myasthenic crisis affects the neuromuscular junction and its diagnosis tends to be easier since in most of the cases a previous diagnosis of myasthenia gravis exists. Muscle weakness increases during repeated activity (muscle fatigue) and improves on resting. Diagnostic confirmation is done by means of edrophonium test and by repeated nerve stimulation, which leads to a rapid decrease by 10-15% of the amplitude of evoked responses. Myopathy of the critically ill patient involves the muscle and provokes a generalized weakness with quadriplegia, very similar to that from polyneuropathy, which prevents or delays weaning from mechanical ventilation, and which may lead to CPK and myoglobin increase in more advanced stages, together with changes in neurophysiological examination. The findings of neurophysiological examination are difficult to differentiate from those encountered in polyneuropathy, although normal sensitive action potentials and reduction of motor action potentials with direct muscle stimulation may help in the differentiation. The functional prognosis of primary muscle impairments tends to be quite good, but both polyneuropathy and myopathy resolve very slowly along weeks or months, with the possibility of an important residual deficit within two years in the most severe cases.",

      "title": "Exploring the pathological interaction between LRRK2 and alpha-synuclein",
      "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the most common age-related neurodegenerative movement disorder that affects 1-2% of the general population over the age of 65 and rising to 4-5% over 80 years of age. It is estimated that 6.3 million people worldwide have Parkinson’s disease and 1.2 million in the European Union (EU) alone. As the disease progresses, patients frequently develop a mask-like facial expression, festinating gait and cognitive impairment and the final clinical symptoms are muscle rigidity, bradykinesia, resting tremor and postural instability in addition to non-motor problems that result in a marked reduction in quality of life. The motor symptoms of PD arise from the progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) leading to a deficiency of the neurotransmitter dopamine (DA) in the striatum. While dopamine replacement therapy is initially effective in treating the motor symptoms of PD, there is no known cure or neuroprotective therapy for this debilitating disease. Although the pathology underlying the disease is well defined, it is still unclear why DAergic neurons degenerate and die. PD is generally considered as a sporadic disease of unknown etiology, however in the last two decades it has become clear that heritability plays an important role in the pathogenesis of PD. Of the different genes associated with familial disease, mutations in two genes encoding for α-synuclein and leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) proteins cause autosomal dominant PD. One of the neuropathological hallmarks of idiopathic and some familial forms of PD are Lewy bodies, which are intracytoplasmic inclusions that are enriched with fibrillar α- synuclein protein. Notably, LRRK2 mutation carriers with PD predominantly develop Lewy body pathology suggesting that LRRK2 may lie upstream of α-synuclein aggregation. These observations and other in vivo studies have suggested a common pathogenic pathway with LRRK2 potentially regulating the aggregation and neuronal toxicity of α-synuclein. However, the relationship between LRRK2 and α-synuclein in the mammalian brain is presently unclear and requires further evaluation, especially within midbrain dopaminergic neurons that degenerate in PD. The aim of this thesis work was to delineate a potential pathogenic interplay between these two PD-related gene products in mediating neurodegeneration in vivo. Understanding how and where the functional pathways of LRRK2 and α-synuclein converge will provide important insight into the common mechanisms underlying neurodegeneration in PD.[...]",

      "abstract": "Extract Introduction Idiopathic Parkinson's disease is a disease of the brain that progresses over time. It mainly affects older people, although younger people can also be affected. The signs of idiopathic Parkinson's disease are caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain through the loss of dopamine. Dopamine is used by the body to help control movement. Levels of dopamine are closely linked with the levels of other chemicals in the brain including acetycholine. There is no definitive reliable diagnostic test that can distinguish from conditions that have similar presentation; therefore, the diagnosis is mainly based on clinical history and physical examination. The symptoms of idiopathic Parkinson's disease typically include: ... Idiopathic Parkinson's disease can also affect your balance and how the person walks (gait). Parkinson's disease affects people differently, so it is important to be aware that not all of these signs maybe experienced by the older person. Treatment and care of the older person with Idiopathic Parkinson's disease should be person centred, involving carers and relatives in the person's care and treatment.",

Anterior type dementia includes several pathological disease entities, almost of them usually exhibit variation of atrophic brain regions in greater or lesser degree. This variation of each disease cause confusion, namely, the same clinical manifestations occur even if it is a different disease and diversely, different clinical manifestations can occur even if it is the same disease entity. This is the reason why discrepancy between clinical diagnosis and pathology diagnosis occurs sometimes in anterior type dementia. For reasonable clinical diagnosis, anterior type dementia, separate from neuropathological diseases entity, should be deal with clinical symptom-complex, which consists of frontotemporal dementia (FTD) progressive nonfluent aphasia (PA) and semantic dementia (SD).

Then, the disease progresses to the brain stem involving the nuclei in the pons and the substantia nigra, and inducing sleep and wakefulness disturbances, affect problems such as anxiety and depression, and motor problems when the disease process has reached the substantia nigra. Furthermore, the disease has an effect on the nucleus basalis of Meynert, the amygdaloid complex and the cerebrum manifesting cognitive impairment. The olfactory pathway is also frequently involved. &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Key Messages:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; For the treatment of PD, younger patients without dementia should be treated with a nonergot dopamine agonist first and then with levodopa if necessary. Elderly patients or those with dementia should be treated with levodopa. However, after 5 years of levodopa treatment, many patients with PD develop wearing off. Drugs for the treatment of wearing-off symptoms are reviewed. Many of the patients with wearing-off symptoms develop dyskinesia, and amantadine is so far the only drug that can ameliorate dyskinesia. Because of this situation, a new method of treatment is warranted, such as RNA interaction, according to the author's opinion. Recent progress in this field is also reviewed. i 2014 S.

The use of continuous electroencephalography has become very ­important in the identification and treatment of seizures in critically ill patients with hepatic or other metabolic disorders. Seizures arise either as a direct result of the organ failure, or as a result of a secondary metabolic disturbance. ­Correction of the underlying metabolic syndrome may result in the prevention and treatment of the seizures. Secondary organ failure and endocrine abnormalities are commonly seen in the neurocritically ill population, and these patients are more prone to seizures. Organ failure can influence the treatment of both new onset and preexisting seizure disorders by altering the pharmacokinetics of major anticonvulsants. Alternatively, anticonvulsants can precipitate organ failure. Therefore, pharmacotherapy of seizures in these settings should be undertaken cautiously.",

Conditions with similar symptoms but other causes than PD (about 1/3 of cases) are called atypical parkinsonism. From a neuropathological perspective, PD is associated with loss of nigro-striatal dopaminergic neurons (related to motor symptoms) and accumulation of alpha-synuclein-containing Lewy bodies in the mid-brain. Nigro-striatal pathways may also be involved in atypical parkinsonism, but lesions in other parts of the brain/basal ganglions dominate. Parkinsonism may also be related to chronic cerebrovascular disease or use of drugs with extrapyramidal side effects.Articles retrieved from PubMed were reviewed to examine current knowledge on diseases other than PD that can induce parkinsonism.Diseases with atypical parkinsonism usually start more symmetric than PD and tremor is either not present or differs from the typical rest tremor seen in PD. An exception is corticobasal degeneration with very asymmetric symptoms. Other (plus-) symptoms in atypical parkinsonism are (early) falling tendency, dizziness upon change of position, coordination difficulties or early cognitive decline. The article describes the clinical characteristics of atypical parkinsonism, possibilities of improved diagnostics with supplementary examinations and alternative treatment strategies.",

      "abstract": "Unilateral neglect can be defined as an impairment to detect, refer, orient or respond to stimuli presented contralaterally to a cerebral lesion, without any impairments in sensory-motor elementary functions. Development. The first descriptions were those of Hughlings Jackson (1876) and Anton (1893). The most important feature of the syndrome is a lateralization bias, which is directional in nature independently of the visual fields. It can be classified in: 1. Attentional (sensory neglect). 2. Intentional (motor neglect). The lesions that may be responsible for the neglect syndromes are usually found in the inferior parietal cortex of the right cerebral hemisphere (superior parietal when optic ataxia is prominent), and the right frontal lobe. Extinction is more frequently related to subcortical lesions (right lenticular nucleus, anterior aspects of peri-ventricular white matter). Unilateral neglect comprises a set of features that may coexist or be isolated traits: 1. Attentional neglect: hemi-inattention, allesthesia, allochiria, anosognosia (with/without somato-paraphrenia or misoplegia), and anoso-diaphoria, sensory extinction. 2. Intentional neglect: hemi-akinesia, directional hypokinesia, motor impersistence, motor extinction. Different theories try to explain the patho-physiology of these phenomena: the attentional-intentional model, the neural network model, the vectorial model, the representational model, and the premotor model, among others.",

Verhaltensstörungen wie Impulskontrollstörungen, das Dopaminerge Dysregulationssyndrom und das sogenannte punding sind trotz z.T. schwerwiegender sozialer, psychischer und physischer Konsequenzen für die Patienten bislang vermutlich unterdiagnostiziert, da sie von ihnen nur selten spontan berichtet werden [1]. Nicht alle Parkinsonpatienten entwickeln im Laufe ihrer Erkrankung Störungen des Verhaltens oder der Impulskontrolle. Es konnten mittlerweile für die verschiedenen Verhaltensstörungen potentielle Risikofaktoren identifiziert werden (z.B. Dopaminagonisten für Impulskontrollstörungen) [2]. Impulskontrollstörungen bei Parkinsonpatienten scheinen mit Veränderungen in der Funktion von Netzwerken assoziiert zu sein, die Belohnungen verarbeiten bzw. Belohnungseffekte vermitteln und/oder Risikoaspekte von Entscheidungen evaluieren [3]. Eine Hauptwirkung von dopaminergen Medikamenten scheint dabei zu sein, das Belohnungssystem zu desensibilisieren. Funktionelle Bildgebungsstudien haben hier gezeigt, dass wohl die tonische Stimulation von D2-Rezeptoren den Effekt des phasischen Abfalls der Dopaminausschüttung bei negativem Feedback ausmerzt und so möglicherweise zu einer Art Fehlprogrammierung führt [4]. Sowohl die Dichte der präsynaptischen Dopamintransporter, als auch die Zahl der unbelegten postsynaptischen D2-Rezeptoren ist bei vulnerablen Patienten scheinbar stark erniedrigt [5,6]. Aktivierungsstudien zeigten eine durch Dopaminagonisten hervorgerufene Deaktivirung inhibitorischer fronto-limbischer Netzwerke nur bei solch vulnerablen Patienten [7]. Im Liche dieser Befunde erscheint ein konstitutionell hoher Dopaminspiegel in den Synapsen des Belohnungssystems als entscheidende Gefährdung gut möglich [8].",

Despite being characterized by very different symptoms, it is well established that these two disorders co-occur at higher rates than expected by chance, resulting in poorer adjustment for the individual than would result from either problem alone. The term<italic>comorbidity</italic>is usually reserved to refer to the association of diagnosed disorders, whereas<italic>co-occurrence</italic>refers more broadly to the association of levels of symptoms of conduct problems and depression, which are usually calculated with means or possibly symptoms counts. In the past two decades, researchers have focused particularly on the following issues regarding the comorbidity of depression and conduct disorder: (1) possible causal associations of the two problem behaviors (i.e., do depressive disorders tend to onset after conduct disorders or vice versa); (2) theory regarding causes of the association (i.e., common versus unique risk factors for these two problem behaviors); (3) changes across development (i.e., with age); (4) risks from diagnosed disorders versus symptoms that do not reach diagnostic criteria; (5) outcomes or prognosis (e.g., are outcomes more severe for co-occurring problems than for either problem alone, are there distinct patterns of outcomes associated with co-occurring problems). Within each of these areas there is considerable interest in moderation of effects by gender or gender similarities and differences. This chapter reviews findings pertaining to these issues and presents suggestions for future research. In addition, assessment approaches and clinical implications are discussed.",

The two major presentations, delirium and postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD), are compared. Risks for delirium are explored; key points from the patient’s history and possible ways to ameliorate the onset are then reviewed. The presentation of POCD is described, and the lack of our understanding of its causes is highlighted. Known triggers such as centrally active anticholinergic drugs or pain are identified. Current thinking in the inflammatory responses within microglia and astrocytes is summarized. Sleep in the elderly is contrasted with that in younger persons, and the main stages of sleep, SWS and REM, described. The impact and importance of the effects that surgery/anaesthesia has on sleep stages is reviewed. Obstructive sleep apnoea is described, including its effect on the safety of anaesthesia and recovery. Periodic limb movement disorders and early Parkinson disease are described.",

      "title": "[Cognitive and neuropsychiatric disorders in Parkinson's disease].",
      "abstract": "In Parkinson's disease there are patients with isolated and multiple cognitive impairment, and their cognitive performance ranges from normal to an advanced degree of dementia. Most patients present an executive deficit, either in isolation or combined with other cognitive disorders, which is considered to be the most characteristic aspect of the disease, and 30-40% of those affected will end up with a clinically-defined dementia.The presence of a mild cognitive disorder in patients with Parkinson means that the risk of dementia appearing at some time during the development of the disease is high. The dementia associated with Parkinson's disease is specifically related with neuropsychiatric signs and symptoms, which may have three possible explanations: disorders affecting the mesolimbic pathways, diffuse limbic and cortical compromise, or associated Alzheimer-type phenomenology. Psychotic episodes tend to present more often in patients with dopaminergic treatment and the clinical spectrum of Parkinson-related psychosis covers visual illusions, visual-audio-olfactory hallucinations, delirium and severe paranoid hallucinatory psychosis. All the antiparkinsonian drugs can give rise to hallucinations and psychosis, but the dopamine agonists are the ones with the greatest capacity to do so.In managing these problems, it is crucial for prevention as well as diagnosis and treatment to be carried out as soon as they are detected. Doses of antiparkinsonian drugs must be reduced, although this is not usually enough, and so it will be necessary to associate atypical antipsychotics, which act mainly on 5-HT receptors and, in most cases, do not produce D2 blockage.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common, prevalent neurodegenerative disease. It is mainly characterized by motor symptoms such as rigidity, tremors, and bradykinesia, but it can also manifest with non-motor symptoms, of which depression is the most frequent. The latter can impair the quality of life, yet it gets overlooked and goes untreated because of the significant overlap in their clinical features, hence making the diagnosis difficult. Furthermore, there is limited data on the availability of appropriate criteria for making the diagnosis of depression in PD patients, as it can occur with varying expressions throughout the course of PD or it can also precede it. This review article has included a brief discussion on the diagnosis of depression in PD patients and their overlapped clinical manifestations. Understanding the mechanisms underlying the disease processes of PD and depression and the pathways interconnecting them gives better knowledge on devising treatment options for the patients. Only studies from Pubmed were included and all other databases were excluded. Studies from the last 50 years were included. Suitable references included in these studies were also extracted. Thus, depression in PD and PD in depression, along with their pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatment options, have been discussed.",

They usually present as nocturia, urgency and increased mictional frequency (pollakiuria). Preferred treatment is with anticholinergic agents. Sexual dysfunction is a frequent complaint in patients with Parkinson. It has a multifactorial aetiology and is more frequent in males than in females. In males it manifests mainly as incapacity to achieve an erection, premature ejaculation or loss of the capacity to ejaculate, whereas in females the predominant signs are decreased libido, lowered arousal and difficulty in reaching an orgasm. Hypersexuality affects young males above all and has been related to the use of dopamine agonists.",

Loss of smell can be the first symptom of pathological abnormalities in the central nervous system (CNS). Several studies related to Parkinson's disease stated that almost all patients studied had atrophy of the olfactory bulb, causing the patient to experience loss of smell function (anosmia). The effect of decreasing the volume of the olfactory bulb and the effect of neurotransmitters are also believed to affect the olfactory dysfunction in patients with Parkinson's disease. Anosmia is the most common non-motor symptom in Parkinson's disease, and often precedes motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease. Olfactory training is a promising modality for the treatment of olfactory dysfunction and anosmia. The results of this systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that it may be an effective treatment for olfactory dysfunction due to various etiologies",

      "title": "Exercising for People with Parkinson’s Disease and Their Support Group",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCTIONParkinson’s disease (PD) is a chronic, progressive, neurodegenerative brain disorder that markedly impairs the performance of activities of daily living (ADLs). PD is the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer’s disease, affecting nearly 700,000 individuals in the United States 45 years and older, and is projected to double by 2030 (1). PD is characterized by bradykinesia (slowness in movement and reduced movement amplitude), resting tremor (rhythmic limb shaking), rigidity (increased muscle tone), postural instability (intolerance to postural threat, causing impaired balance), and gait abnormalities. The cause of PD is unknown, but aging, genetic susceptibility, environmental factors, inflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction likely all play a role (2). PD advances over time resulting in increased disability, driven by the progression of motor and nonmotor symptoms, medication complications, and motor disabilities with poor responses to medication such as postural instability and gait (2). Individuals with PD often display a stooped posture and a short shuffling walking stride along with a decreased arm swing and poorer walking economy when compared with persons without PD (3). Getting up, changing direction, turning around, and transferring from one place to another gets harder as PD advances. Other symptoms that affect quality of life may include excessive salivation or drooling; soft, slurred speech; and a variety of nonmotor features, including cognitive impairment, mood disorders, and sleep disorders. Individuals with PD (especially those in advanced stages) may have autonomic nervous system dysfunction, including cardiovascular dysfunction (4). Orthostatic hypotension, heat intolerance, sweating disturbances, and urinary problems also are associated with PD (4). HOW PD IS DIAGNOSED, ASSESSED, AND TREATEDPD is diagnosed following a comprehensive review of medical history and a neurological and physical examination. A person must have bradykinesia and either tremor or rigidity for the diagnosis of PD. The Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) is used to monitor the burden and extent of PD (5). It is the gold standard for assessing treatment interventions. The MDS-UPDRS covers four domains: part I assesses the nonmotor experiences of daily living such as cognition, depression, sleep, fatigue, and hallucinations; part II assesses the patient’s perception of their ability to engage in ADLs such as eating, dressing, hobbies, and walking; part III covers the motor evaluation, which includes ratings for rigidity, bradykinesia, gait, postural stability, and tremor; and part IV assesses the motor complications, including ratings for dyskinesias (involuntary movements), dystonia (painful cramps), and motor fluctuations (irregular responses to PD medication) (5). The standard treatments for PD are exercise, medication, and deep brain stimulation. However, medication and deep brain stimulation can have serious side effects, and neither have consistently demonstrated efficacy for balance/mobility, cognition, or delaying disease progression. By contrast, evidence suggests that exercise can reduce disease severity (6), slow the progression of the signs of the disease (7), as well as improve strength (6), aerobic capacity (7), and gait performance (8). EXERCISE BENEFITS AND PRESCRIPTION Because PD is a chronic and progressive disorder, an exercise program should be prescribed early when the individual is first diagnosed, should continue throughout life, and should be reviewed and revised as the disease progresses. Exercise prescription should ultimately aim to slow the rate at which the signs of the disease progress, limit comorbidities, minimize complications associated with muscle disuse, and maintain the ability to live an independent life. This can be accomplished by simultaneously addressing cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular strength, flexibility/mobility, neuromotor training, and balance. Regular aerobic exercise has been shown to attenuate PD progression (9). Moderate-intensity aerobic exercise improves aerobic fitness, fatigue, mood, executive function, and quality of life in mild to moderate PD (10,11) and high-intensity endurance exercise (80% to 85% HRmax) attenuates the worsening of motor signs (7). An individual with PD can safely enjoy a variety of exercise modalities, including treadmills, stationary cycles, recumbent cycles, ellipticals, rowers, and arm ergometers. Aerobic training at high intensity (80% to 85% HRmax) (7) and even higher intensity (12) as well as HIIT training involving whole body movements (>85% HRmax) (13) can be safely prescribed to individuals with early stage PD and should be encouraged for individuals who are willing and able to do this. Aerobic exercise should be performed for 30 minutes per day, 3 to 4 days per week at high intensity (80% to 85% HRmax) for mild to moderate PD, or at moderate intensity (60% to 65% HRmax) for deconditioned individuals or those with more advanced PD, with the goal of eventually progressing to 80% to 85% HRmax. This combination of frequency, intensity, and time has the strongest support in the literature for potentially slowing down the progression of the signs of the disease. The optimum training load for each individual may vary, so it may be useful for certain individuals to break exercise bouts into shorter durations that accumulate to 30 minutes per day. Although some individuals may be capable of and motivated to exercise more than 3 to 4 days per week, it is important not to underestimate the importance of rest and recovery and be cognizant of the signs and symptoms of overtraining. Individuals who want to exercise more than 3 to 4 days per week should intersperse different types of low-intensity exercise between days of high-intensity exercise. Resistance training also is beneficial in PD and can improve muscle strength and power (14), movement speed, and dynamic balance, along with quality of life, usually the same as seen in neurologically normal controls (6). Free weights may be used, although they tend to be less safe at more advanced stages and in those with increased severity of tremor, especially during exercises that involve overhead lifting (15). Resistance training should be performed between 2 and 3 days per week at 30% to 60% of 1-RM for individuals beginning to improve strength or 60% to 80% 1-RM for more advanced exercisers. In lieu of free weights, weight machines, resistance bands, or body weight can be implemented as needed or preferred. As resistance training progresses, unstable devices such as balance pads, dyna discs, balance discs, BOSU balls, or Swiss balls should be incorporated with the resistance training routine. When unstable devices are incorporated, mobility, motor signs, neuromuscular outcomes, balance, and quality of life improve, whereas cognitive impairment and fear of falling are reduced (16–18). The increase in motor complexity of the exercise routine (i.e., degree of instability) along with the increase in strength both contribute to the positive outcomes (16–18). Balance impairment and falls can be major problems in those with PD, and although both endurance and resistance exercise will benefit posture and balance, it is crucial for individuals with PD to perform neuromotor training specifically for posture, balance, gait, and mobility. Neuromotor training consists of a variety of different challenging physical activities (e.g., multidirectional step training, step up and down, reaching forward and sideways, obstacles, turning around, walking with suitable step length, standing up, and sitting down). Using rhythmic auditory stimulation during multidirectional step training can improve functional gait parameters, including balance, and those improvements will be maintained longer than when external cueing is not used (19). Neuromotor training should progress exercise motor complexity (coordinative and control requirements of the motor activity) and quantitative training parameters (i.e., FITT principles). The progression of both the exercise motor complexity and the quantitative training parameters should be done sequentially rather than simultaneously, as the former impairs the progression of the latter. Other alternative forms of exercise are beneficial for individuals with PD, including Tai Chi, partnered and unpartnered dance (20,21), and Lee Silverman Voice Training (LSVT)/BIG. Dance interventions improve certain motor symptoms and functional mobility, especially those that use rhythmic tasks and visual and auditory cues (22). Tai Chi has been shown to improve motor function, balance, and quality of life in those with PD, and it also may improve fall risk and depression (20). LSVT/BIG is a movement-based behavioral treatment that improves motor function in people with PD (23). In addition, incorporating concepts of the LSVT/BIG program (large amplitude, exaggerated movement patterns performed with high intensity, and effort that become progressively more difficult and complex) into functional exercise helps to restore normal movement amplitude in real life situations (23). SUMMARY The PD exercise prescription consists of resistance, endurance (cardiovascular), and balance exercises. In addition, core training, neuromotor training, dual-task training, and multitask training also will benefit overall health, well-being, and the ability to perform everyday activities for the person with PD. Each exercise modality addresses different components of health and should not be overlooked. Although it is clear that there are benefits to rigorously quantifying exercise dose, many forms of exercise do not naturally lend themselves to the FITT principles, and yet the activities can be clearly beneficial such as dancing and boxing. In parallel to considering exercise dosage, it is important to monitor fatigue, any increases in motor symptoms, fluctuations in response to medication, as well as disease progression. It is important to adapt and identify the optimum training load for the current state of the individual.",

      "title": "Differential Diagnosis of Dementia",
      "abstract": "The differential diagnosis of dementia is a two-stage process. The first stage is the differentiation of dementia from other causes of cognitive impairment. The differential diagnosis of dementia includes: depression; delirium, drugs; normal ageing and circumstances where the diagnosis is problematic such as when the patient has severe sensory deficits. Second, if it is found to be a form of dementia, the elucidation of the aetiology. Alzheimer's disease is the commonest form of dementia, cerebrovascular disease is probably the second commonest cause and Lewy body dementia is becoming increasingly recognised. Other conditions that can be excluded on clinical grounds without resort to complex and detailed investigations are subcortical dementias (Parkinson's disease, Huntington's chorea and progressive supranuclear palsy), alcohol induced dementia and a number of toxic/metabolic abnormalities such as endocrine disorders and carcinoma. The differential diagnosis of dementia is an excellent example of where simple logical clinical skills can be applied without the need for expensive investigation, which should be reserved for situations in which there is clinical doubt about the diagnosis. Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is diagnosed on clinical grounds and in the presence of a characteristically abnormal electroencephalogram (EEG). For a comprehensive assessment of a person with suspected dementia, the following are necessary: detailed family and personal history and history of the current illness from a reliable informant; mental state examination of the patient with particular reference to the cognitive state; physical examination with particular emphasis on the central nervous system and; investigations, including haematological and biochemical blood tests, serum B12 and folate, thyroid function tests, chest X-ray and ECG. Other investigations may also be helpful such as CT scan or EEG.",

      "title": "A clinical overview of non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's Disease.",
      "abstract": "Although Parkinson's disease (PD) is diagnosed on the basis of motor symptoms, including slowness of movement, tremor, rigidity and difficulties with balance and walking, now we are aware that non-motor symptoms are highly prevalent, since they can anticipate motor symptoms and can cause severe consequences. Several studies have shown that non-motor symptoms, such as depression, anxiety and apathy, psychosis (e.g., hallucinations, delusions), sleep disturbance, and pain may have a greater adverse impact on quality of life and health economics compared with motor symptoms. Non-motor symptoms can be divided into four domains: neuropsychiatric (e.g., depression, anxiety, apathy, hallucinations, dementia), autonomic (e.g., constipation, orthostatic hypotension, urinary changes, sweating abnormalities), sleep (e.g., insomnia, sleep fragmentation, excessive daytime sleepiness, rapid eye movement, sleep behavioural disorder, restless leg syndrome), and sensory dysfunction (e.g., pain, olfactory dysfunction). This review addresses diagnosis and treatment of these disorders. The causative mechanisms remain complex, since they reflect the widespread brainstem and cortical pathology of PD, with involvement of several neurotransmitters, including dopamine (DA), serotonin, norepinephrine, and acetylcholine. The diagnosis is often challenging, especially for psychiatric disorders, and in particular affective disorders, because somatic features of psychopathology may overlap with the movement disorder itself. Treatments used are limited and psychiatric drugs may not be as effective as in general population. Evidence based medicine is quite poor and it still requires well-designed clinical studies.",

Parkinson-Syndrome spielen in der klinischen Neurologie eine wichtige Rolle und sind häufig durch neurodegenerative Krankheiten wie die Parkinson-Krankheit (PK), Multisystematrophie (MSA) oder progressive supranukleäre Blickparese (progressive supranuclear palsy, PSP) verursacht. Die motorischen Symptome Akinese, Rigor und Ruhetremor sprechen bei der PK meist gut auf die symptomatische medikamentöse Therapie an. Im Verlauf ist die PK aber durch Wirkungsfluktuationen der dopaminergen Therapie und durch das Auftreten axialer Symptome wie Hypophonie, Dysphagie, Haltungsstörungen, posturale Instabilität und freezing, die nur bedingt durch Medikamente gebessert werden, charakterisiert. Bei den atypischen Parkinson-Syndromen wie der MSA oder PSP ist das Ansprechen auf die medikamentöse Behandlung erfahrungsgemäß schlecht. Daher gewinnen nicht-medikamentöse neurorehabilitative Methoden bei Parkinson-Syndromen zunehmend an Bedeutung, auch wenn vor allem bei den atypischen Formen die Evidenzlage unbefriedigend ist. Außerdem sind Pumpentherapien (Apomorphin, Duodopa®) sowie die Nachbehandlung von Patienten mit PK nach Tiefer Hirnstimulation (THS) häufig Bestandteil einer stationären Neurorehabilitation.",

      "title": "Focusing on the tetra-partite synapse in Parkinson’s disease research using human patient-derived neurons",
      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) was first described as a neurological disease by Dr. James Parkinson in 1817 as a \"shaking palsy\". Since that time, much more is known about the pathophysiology of PD yet the disease is still uncurable. The hallmark of the disease is often considered Lewy body neural inclusions in the substantia nigra pars compacta and other brain areas, although not all patients have these inclusions. The patients exhibit massive neuronal cell loss in the substantia nigra pars compacta, which is associated with the motor symptoms of tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, and postural instability. PD is the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's disease with a prevalence of around 1% of individuals over the age of 60. PD is a progressive and incurable disease with other non-motor symptoms, sometimes prodromal, such as depression, impaired olfaction, constipation, urinary dysfunction, decreased respiratory muscle strength, and more. Animal in vivo models have been widely used to study PD. However, their limitations include species differences and the inability to fully replicate human disease, especially the sporadic forms of the disease. Human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) offer the potential to generate patient-specific neurons that can recapitulate disease-specific phenotypes. This approach enabled the discovery of some pathophysiological mechanisms, gene dysregulation, affected pathways, and electrophysiological differences in neurons of neurodevelopmental, neuropsychiatric, and neurodegenerative disorders (Schafer et al., 2019; Stern et al., 2023). In the last decade, several mutations have been discovered to associate with and even cause PD, although these mutations account for 15–25% of PD cases, while the rest are considered sporadic PD (sPD). Using neurons derived from PD patients with iPSC technologies revealed new mechanistic understandings of the pathological processes in PD (Lau et al., 2021; Stern et al., 2022b, c, 2023; van den Hurk et al., 2022; Rike and Stern, 2023; Rosh et al., 2023). These studies measured the changes in electrophysiology, transcriptome, and metabolome of dopaminergic (DA) neurons derived from PD patients with quite a few monogenic mutations as well as sPD. These novel cellular models allowed for the identification of mutation-specific neurophysiology, and importantly convergent biological mechanisms in patients that harbor a variety of mutations but with similar motor symptoms. In a recent paper (Stern et al., 2022b), a significant reduction in synaptic activity was observed in DA neurons derived from PD patients with duplication and a triplication of the synuclein alpha gene (SNCA), and other mutations such as leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), Parkin mutations, and sPD patients. The sPD-related phenotypes were milder. Figure 1 shows the synaptic deficits in the PD patients reported by Stern et al. (2022b) through new recordings using whole-cell patch-clamp from DA neurons differentiated from the PD patients reported. These reports highlight and emphasize the synaptic deficit hypothesis of PD that was previously suggested but with a small number of monogenic forms of the disease using mice models.Figure 1: A reduction of the rate of excitatory post-synaptic currents (EPSCs) of dopaminergic (DA) neurons was observed across Parkinson's disease (PD) mutations and sporadic PD (sPD).The images presented are further recordings and analysis of neurons from the induced pluripotent stem cells cohort that was reported by Stern et al. (2022b). (A) EPSCs recorded in DA neurons derived from healthy control, alpha-synuclein (SNCA) triplication, a specific mutation in the SNCA gene, where the amino acid alanine is replaced by threonine at position 5 (SNCA-A53T), leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2) mutation, SNCA duplication, glucocerebrosidase gene (GBA) mutation, a mutation in the PARK2 gene, which is responsible for encoding the parkin protein (Parkin mutation) and sPD.

(C) Representative traces of evoked action potentials from DA neurons of PD patients and healthy controls show no significant differences in the excitability. Created with Adobe illustrator. Unpublished data.The study conducted revealed previously unknown genes that were convergently differentially expressed in DA neurons derived from all PD lines with monogenic mutations and the sporadic form of the disease, including many collagens and integrin genes. This was further confirmed by protein-level experiments. Additionally, using gene ontology and pathway analysis, some pathways appeared to be convergent across PD such as focal adhesion, PI3K-Akt signaling, extracellular matrix (ECM)-related pathways, pathways related to cancer, oxidoreductase activity, and protein digestion and absorption. This was in addition to synapse-related pathways, such as synapse, synaptic membrane, and post-synapse. These findings are extremely important since for many years much focus has been put on the neuronal contribution to the disease progression. Recently, the roles of glial cells have also been recognized. The role of glia in PD is complex and they are being elucidated in recent years. Astrocytes and microglia are involved in the neuroinflammatory response caused by the accumulation of α-synuclein and neuronal damage, astrocytes also contribute through mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress, and oligodendrocytes have a role in myelin disruption and axonal degeneration (Araújo et al., 2022). However, little effort is being directed toward studying the extracellular environment in PD. These recent studies (Stern et al., 2022b; Rike and Stern, 2023) suggest that the ECM and the adhesion of the cells to the ECM (the focal adhesion pathways) are the most common dysregulated pathways in the disease. The ECM is the three-dimensional network of water, proteins, and polysaccharides. The ECM provides a physical scaffold for neurons and facilitates the organization into distinct central nervous system regions. During development, it produces diverse molecular signals that guide growth and activity and is involved in regulating the morphogenesis of the developing neural tube and neocortex, impacting developing neural tissue. The ECM is implicated in neurogenesis, neural migration and differentiation, and axonal growth and pathfinding (Myers et al., 2011). In the adult central nervous system, the ECM is involved in maintaining homeostasis and is involved in synaptic remodeling and plasticity (Ferrer-Ferrer and Dityatev, 2018). The ECM contains three main structural components: the basement membrane, the perineuronal nets, and the neural interstitial matrix. The significant role that the ECM in regulating synaptic connections and plasticity has been recently fully recognized and it is now considered a part of the tetrapartite synapse, consisting of the pre-synaptic and post-synaptic neurons, glia, and the ECM (Dityatev and Rusakov, 2011). Accumulating data support the roles of the interactions between presynaptic and postsynaptic neuronal elements with glia and the ECM for the formation and plasticity of chemical synapses (Ferrer-Ferrer and Dityatev, 2018). Neural ECM is formed and destroyed in an activity-dependent manner. In the adult brain lattices of the extracellular matrix tightly enwrap the synapses. These lattices stabilize synapses, preventing them from undergoing structural or morphological changes. These lattices need to permit the events of synaptic plasticity. The dysregulation of synaptic ECM has been linked to synaptopathies in a long list of brain disorders (Ferrer-Ferrer and Dityatev, 2018). The aberrant ECM appears in these human PD iPSC-derived neurons at the same time as the synaptic dysfunction and maybe therefore related to one another. Mice models have shown previously that synaptic deficits are central to PD. The human iPSC models show that the synaptic deficits are present already when the neurons are young and at that stage, the PD neurons express many ECM genes at a lower level than neurons derived from healthy subjects Focal adhesion genes such as the integrins are also down-regulated at this stage. This defective focal adhesion may contribute to neurodegeneration through several mechanisms. One of them is known is termed Anoikis – cell death through the detachment of the cells from the ECM. Figure 2 presents common genes that are differentially expressed in monogenic PD and sPD in ECM and focal adhesion-related pathways re-analyzing the data shown in Stern et al. (2022b).Figure 2: Common genes that are differentially expressed in monogenic and sporadic Parkinson's disease (sPD) dopaminergic (DA) neurons related to extracellular matrix (ECM) and focal adhesion pathways.The graphs presented are a re-analysis of RNA sequencing data from DA neurons differentiated from our previously reported cohort (Stern et al., 2022b). (A) ECM receptor interaction: 9 genes are differentially expressed in monogenic neurons and 7 genes in sPD with 7 genes in common. (B) ECM organization: 16 genes differentially expressed in monogenic neurons, 14 genes in sPD, and 11 genes in common. (C) ECM structural constituent: 7 genes differentially expressed in monogenic and 5 in sPD with 7 genes in common. (D) ECM: 15 genes differently expressed in monogenic, 11 in sPD, and 10 in common. (E) focal adhesion: 21 genes differentially expressed in monogenic and 10 in sPD, with 16 genes in common. (F) Focal adhesion: 13 genes are differently expressed in monogenic and 9 in sPD with 13 genes differently expressed in common. Created with Adobe illustrator.Through RNA sequencing, the recent studies of the iPSC-derived neurons discovered several dysregulated pathways that are shared in many types of PD mutations, including sporadic PD (Stern et al., 2022b, 2023; Rike and Stern, 2023; Rosh et al., 2023). The PI3K-Akt signaling pathway was one of the most dysregulated pathways. It is a complex network of cellular signaling that plays a crucial role in regulating a wide range of cellular processes, including cell growth, survival, proliferation, metabolism, and protein synthesis. Activation of the PI3K-Akt pathway promotes cell growth and survival by stimulating protein synthesis, inhibiting apoptosis, and promoting cell cycle progression. Dysregulation of this pathway has been implicated in the pathogenesis of a wide range of diseases, including cancer, diabetes, and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease and PD. More findings in transcriptome pathways have also been published recently looking at differential gene expression signatures of midbrain neurons derived from PD patients (van den Hurk et al., 2022). They analyzed 80 bulk RNA-seq samples, 5315 single-cell RNA-sequencing samples, and 44 Patch-seq samples. The researchers combined the transcriptomes of sporadic and familial genotypes. The research has identified six major pathways that were disrupted in PD, including neurotransmission and synaptic function, energy and metabolism, neuromorphogenesis & cytoskeleton (including several ECM and focal adhesion pathways) intracellular trafficking, glia inflammation and immunity, and cellular and oxidative stress responses. Since the development of the technology of iPSCs, bio-engineered neuronal tissues offer a unique experimental opportunity to uncover the molecular dysregulations that precede neurodegeneration in humans. These recent studies identified dysregulated pathways and may guide or reinforce future therapeutic pipelines, and future studies will be required to assess their pharmacological potential to rescue multiple transcriptomic pathways dysregulated in PD neurons. Importantly, these recent studies suggest another unexplored mechanism in PD that relates to the extracellular space. Together using transcriptome and electrophysiological analyses, these studies provide evidence that the tetra-partite synapse consisting of the pre-synaptic neuron, the post-synaptic neuron, the glia, and the brain ECM is highly involved in PD. The following review aimed to summarize ECM-related studies in PD using postmortem tissue and iPSC studies explored the literature in these human models and focused on transcriptional and proteomic changes that occur in the brain ECM during PD neurodegeneration (Rike and Stern, 2023). It reported that collagens, integrins, annexins, tenascins, and versicans are the most commonly dysregulated proteins in the frontal cortex and substantia nigra of PD patients. Dysregulation of collagen and integrin proteins and genes was observed in both brain tissue and iPSCs studies. ECM proteins, such as collagens IV and VI and versican, interact with neurons and impact synaptic connections and neuronal survival. In addition, ECM proteases and regulator enzymes are also aberrant in iPSCs studies of PD such as the matrix metalloproteinases and A disintegrin and metalloproteases (Stern et al., 2022b). These recent studies using human iPSC model studies suggest that ECM and focal adhesion genes and proteins are severely dysregulated in PD in a convergent manner. Interestingly, the transcriptome analysis of other brain disorders shows that these pathways are affected and dysregulated as well. Just as an example, we note that pathways relating to the brain ECM and to cell and focal adhesions are at the top dysregulated pathways in bipolar disorder (Santos et al., 2021), autism (Brant et al., 2021), and schizophrenia (Stern et al., 2022a). Interestingly, in these three disorders, the synapse is also affected both when analyzing the transcriptome and the electrophysiology. Recently, 3D brain organoid models were suggested for the study of brain disorders (Steinberg et al., 2021). When aiming to study the tetra-partite synapse involvement, and how the extracellular environment affects neurodegeneration, the 2D models will not fully recapitulate the structures of the ECM scaffolds. Switching to 3D models such as brain organoids is necessary. These organoids have brain-like structures and can enable a dynamic measurement of localizations and aggregations in the 3D space of various proteins as a model of the neurodegeneration process in the brain. During organoid production, embryoid bodies are embedded in Matrigel. Matrigel is a commonly available matrix that is highly enriched in collagen IV and laminin. The addition of these ECM proteins during the generation of the organoids is therefore highly disruptive when trying to assess how the ECM is affected in PD. This calls for the development of brain organoids where ECM proteins are not added during their embeddings. Such gels are available today from a variety of sources and these synthetic-matrix-based organoids should be developed before we can continue with using brain organoids to model brain ECM. In summary, iPSC technologies provide an excellent model system to investigate the molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of PD. Several studies have shown that changes in synaptic activity, ECM, and focal adhesion pathways play a central role in PD pathophysiology, putting the tetra-partite synapse as a focus area rather than the synapse by itself. This may suggest that in addition to dopamine precursors, delivering ECM proteins such as collagens and integrins may provide new therapeutic possibilities. Although the use of human iPSCs is a very promising field, there are some limitations when using 2D models to study the extracellular environment as the interactions between different cell types and the extracellular space are not recapitulated. As discussed, the 3D models are currently also not suitable for this work and synthetic gel-based organoid models need to be developed before proceeding. On the other hand, much has been discovered about PD using iPSCs, as reported in this paper and the future perspectives are exciting because it provides many possibilities for future studies. For instance, it provides a model that can be used for personalized medicine thanks to the ability to generate patient-specific neurons to study disease mechanisms and drug responses that are specific to each patient, even for sPD patients. This could lead to more personalized treatment options for PD patients. Additionally, recent advances in gene-editing technologies have made it possible to introduce specific mutations or correct them in patient-derived iPSCs, helping to pinpoint causative interactions of cellular and extracellular deficits and neurodegeneration. Overall, the use of iPSCs in PD research holds great promise for advancing our understanding of the disease and developing new treatments.

Such impairment has been related to several factors (age, arteriosclerosis, motor difficulties, depression, dopaminergic therapy, cortical and/or subcortical lesions). Parkinsonian dementia may be caused by the extent of the degenerative process. Our own results show that parkinsonian patients with dementia are different from nondemented ones with the following features: a) a more marked bradykinesia b) a more severe extrapyramidal picture c) a progressive unresponsiveness to levodopa in a shorter time. It seems possible that there is a Parkinson syndrome characterized, clinically, by an intellectual impairment with a poor prognosis quoad valetudinem, and, anatomically, with multiple cortical and subcortical lesions. Such syndrome may be a \"transition\" form between Parkinson disease and senile-presenile dementia.",

Akinesia is a requisite sign for diagnosis and is usually accompanied by rigidity: tremor is a variable finding. The causes of parkinsonism can be classified into three major groups: idiopathic Parkinson's Disease (IPD), atypical parkinsonian syndromes and other neurodegenerative disorders, and secondary or symptomatic causes. This chapter discusses the diagnosis of IPD and briefly reviews the conditions that most commonly mimic IPD with particular emphasis on the atypical or 'parkinsonism plus' syndromes. The diagnosis of IPD remains entirely clinical at present since there are no specific biological markers. Some investigations are useful in recognising other causes of parkinsonism. Akinesia is the core feature of parkinsonism and must be present if the diagnosis is to be sustained. Rigidity is recognised as an increase in resistance to passive movements around a joint. Pathological changes and cell loss develop gradually in IPD during an unknown period of time.",

      "abstract": "Functional (psychogenic) movement disorders (FMD) constitute a cluster of heterogeneous diagnoses involving motor symptoms that cannot be explained by organic pathology and are often associated with underlying psychological problems. In psychiatry, patients with FMD are often placed within the scope of somatoform disorders and conversion disorders. Functional Parkinsonism (FP) is a rare form of FMD seen in 1.5% of all patients presenting with symptoms of parkinsonism. Although almost all symptoms of parkinsonism can be present in FP, clinical features such as sudden onset and a nonprogressive course, inconsistent response to pharmacotherapy, and atypical findings in neurological examination are considered as important clues of psychogenic aetiology. Limited data in the literature on FP indicate that the average age of onset is between 37-53 years of age, whereas the average onset age of Idiopathic Parkinson's Disease (IPD) is around 60; and Juvenile Parkinsonism, a rare condition presenting before the age of 21, is often familial and more closely related to genetic mutations. Here, we present the case of a female patient, who, after the diagnosis of Juvenile Parkinsonism at the age of 17, had been treated with antiparkinsonian medications for about 14 years in the neurology clinic. Even though the age of onset of this case was far earlier than expected for both IPD and FP and the symptoms became chronic despite close monitoring, it is believed that this case is a striking example for the importance of the recognition of FP and early intervention.",

      "title": "Neuropsychological Functions and SPECT Neuroimaging in Parkinson’s Disease",
      "abstract": "IntroductionParkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic progressive neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by motor and non-motor signs.It was Charcot, who first in 1875 pointed out that 'psychic faculties are definitely impaired' and that 'the mind becomes clouded and the memory is lost'.Most patients with PD experience some degree of cognitive impairment, ranging from mild selective deficits to Parkinson's disease dementia (Dubois & Pillon, 1997).PD patients may also spend several years in a transition state called Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), which is now recognized as one of the cardinal non-motor manifestations of PD.It is a major cause of disability, and has been shown to be an important predictor for quality of life (Karlsen et al., 1998).Recent studies have reported a 21% prevalence rate of MCI in a large PD population and consider MCI as a risk factor for developing Parkinson's disease Dementia (PDD) (Caviness et al., 2007;Janvin et al., 2006;Levin et al., 1992).The neuropathophysiological basis of cognitive deficits in PD is complicated and includes degeneration of dopaminergic neurons mainly of the nigrostriatal pathway and to a lesser degree the mesocortical and mesolimbic pathways.The striatum is closely interrelated to cortical areas mainly to the frontal lobes.The neuropathophysiological puzzle is further complicated by multiple neurotransmitter deficits including noradrenalin, serotonin and acetylcholine pathway as well as Lewy body-type degeneration in cortical and limbic structures (Mandir & Vaughan, 2000).The direct dopaminergic connections between the ventral tegmental area and the prefrontal cortex may also influence changes in cognition (Cools 2006;Mattay et al., 2002).The pattern of cognitive impairment seen even in early PD mainly resembles that produced by frontal lobe damage, as the basal ganglia and prefrontal cortex are closely interrelated through anatomofunctional circuits (Alexander et al., 1986;Bondi et al., 1993) and include deficits mainly in cognitive flexibility, planning, working memory and learning.Perfusion brain single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) provides a wellestablished means of studying regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) which is known to reflect cortical function.On the other hand Dopamine Transporter (DAT) SPECT imaging can be used as a marker for the degree of loss of dopaminergic nerve endings.It is well known that SPECT Neuroimaging can assist in the differential diagnosis of parkinsonian and dementia www.intechopen.com",

      "title": "Animal Models of Parkinson’s Disease Induced by Toxins and Genetic Manipulation",
      "abstract": "IntroductionParkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common chronic neurodegenerative disorders.It is characterized by a variety of motor (bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor, and postural instability) and nonmotor (autonomic disturbances and psychosis) symptoms.Although it can be diagnosed accurately, no therapeutic strategies can cure or completely block the progression of PD.Pathologically, PD is characterized by the severe loss of dopaminergic (DAergic) neurons in the pars-compacta nigra and the presence of proteinaceous synuclein inclusions, called Lewy bodies (LBs), which are present in neurons of the central nervous system (specific cortical regions, brain stem, and spinal cord), peripheral autonomic nervous system, enteric nervous system (ENS), and cutaneous nerves (Braak et al., 2006;Ikemura et al., 2008;Lebouvier et al., 2009).Similar to other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, age is the major risk factor for PD although 10% of the people with the disease are younger than 45.Although PD is regarded as a sporadic disorder, remarkably few environmental causes or triggers have been identified (Dick et al., 2007;Tanner, 2003;Taylor et al., 2005).Pesticides and herbicides are the most likely candidates for environmental agents associated with the pathogenesis of PD.On the other hand, PD characteristics are seen in a number of familial motor disorders caused by different genetic factors.Animal models of neurodegenerative diseases, including PD, have in general been quite instructive in understanding their pathogenesis.Ideally, animal models of PD, whether induced by environmental risk factors (neurotoxins) or genetic manipulations, should faithfully reproduce the clinical manifestations (behavioral abnormalities), pathological features, and molecular dysfunctions characterizing the disease.Unfortunately, animal models rarely mimic the etiology, progression, and pathology of PD completely, and in most cases, only partial insight can be gained from these studies.Despite these difficulties, animal models are considered to be very helpful in the development of therapies to treat PD.In this paper, we discuss recently developed neurotoxin-induced and genetic model animals of PD.Over the years, many chemical compounds and toxin have been identified causative agents of PD. 1-Methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) is a representative strong neurotoxin that has been recognized from several young drug addicts developed severe parkinsonism.The addicts illegally achieved street preparations of drugs and products were contaminated with MPTP.In addition, epidemiologically, environmental neurotoxins such www.intechopen.comMechanisms in Parkinson's Disease -Models and Treatments 324 as agricultural chemicals (pesticides, herbicides, and fungicides) are promising candidates for causative factors of PD.Rotenone and paraquat could promote and accelerate the development of PD.Oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction induced by these toxins could contribute to the progression of PD.While most cases of PD are sporadic, specific mutations in genes that cause familial forms of PD have led to provide new insights into its pathogenesis.Analysis of these gene products may provide vital clues to our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of dopaminergic neuronal death in PD.Over 10 causative genes for autosomal-dominant (-synuclein, Ubiqitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCHL1), and Leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2)) or autosomal-recessive (parkin, phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN)-induced putative kinase 1 (PINK1), and DJ-1 inheritance PD have been identified and classified for PARK loci.Studying animal models are important tools in experimental medical science for understanding the pathogenesis and therapeutic intervention strategies of human diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases such as PD.However, it is quite difficult to completely reproduce symptomatic and pathological features of human disorders.Since many human diseases including PD do not arise spontaneously in animals, in particular, characteristic functional changes have to be mimicked by neurotoxic agents.Nevertheless, recent studies have indicated excellent neurotoxin-induced animal models of PD.In addition, many genetic animal models of familial PD have been generated and recognized valuable tools for investigating and understanding pathophysiology of familial and even sporadic PD.Apart from the obvious preference for vertebrate (rodents and primates) models to investigate PD, an increasing number of studies have also shown a number of advantages and the utility of invertebrate (flies and nematodes) models.The central nervous system of invertebrate animal has a rather small number of neuron and glia as compared to vertebrates, however, essential functional features such as neurotransmitter system of vertebrates and invertebrates are conserved.This chapter focuses on animal models of both toxin-induced and genetically determined PD that have provided significant insight for understanding this disease.We also discuss the validity, benefits, and limitations of representative models.

      "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that is common in older people and is highly associated with depression, anxiety, apathy, psychosis, cognitive impairment, imbalance and sleep disturbances. These patients have an increased risk of fracture compared to the general population. Comprehensive searches of databases are performed to identify reviews about the risk of fractures in this disease. Parkinson’s patients are at increased risk for low bone mineral density due to the effect of drugs, Parkinson’s disease and age factor, leading to an increased risk of falling down and fractures, especially in the hip. So, improved and innovative treatments with the focus on minimizing inadvertent bone resorption with anti-Parkinson’s disease medication will be highly effective in reducing fear of the disease and providing the patient with a better quality of life.",

      "abstract": "Objectives. Sjögren's syndrome (SS) may be complicated by some neurological manifestations, generally sensory polyneuropathy. Furthermore, involvement of cranial nerves was described as rare complications of SS. Methods. We reported 2 cases: the first one was a 40-year-old woman who developed neuritis of the left optic nerve as presenting symptom few years before the diagnosis of SS; the second was a 54-year-old woman who presented a paralysis of the right phrenic nerve 7 years after the SS onset. An exhaustive review of the literature on patients with cranial or phrenic nerve involvements was also carried out. Results. To the best of our knowledge, our second case represents the first observation of SS-associated phrenic nerve mononeuritis, while optic neuritis represents the most frequent cranial nerve involvement detectable in this connective tissue disease. Trigeminal neuropathy is also frequently reported, whereas neuritis involving the other cranial nerves is quite rare. Conclusions. Cranial nerve injury is a harmful complication of SS, even if less commonly recorded compared to peripheral neuropathy. Neurological manifestations may precede the clinical onset of SS; therefore, in patients with apparently isolated cranial nerve involvement, a correct diagnosis of the underlying SS is often delayed or overlooked entirely; in these instances, standard clinicoserological assessment is recommendable.",

      "abstract": "Involuntary emotional expression disorder (IEED) is underrecognized by clinicians, misdiagnosed as depression or bipolar disorder and undertreated, because clinicians are unfamiliar with the disorder. An important clinical consideration for IEED is that of distinguishing mood from affect. IEED describes a syndrome of relatively stereotypical episodes of uncontrollable crying and/or laughing, resulting from lesions of multiple types, in multiple brain regions, without an apparent stimulus to trigger such responses. This syndrome is common among a number of neurological diseases like patients with a stroke or traumatic brain injury (TBI), patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), multiple sclerosis (MS), as well as dementias such as Alzheimer;s disease (AD), and motor disorders such as Parkinson;s disease (PD). The neuropathological cause and neurochemistry of the disorder remains unclear. There is general agreement that IEED is the result of an injury to the neurological pathways that control the expression of emotions. Adequate treatment can reduce the frequency and improve the quality of life of patients and caregivers.",

Currently, there are more than 2 million people world wide who have been afflicted with polio as children or young adults and who now may exhibit symptoms of the post-polio syndrome. The purpose of this review is to provide the current information on the syndrome’s causes and promote information exchange on the epidemiology, diagnosis and management of PPS. Post-polio syndrome is characterized by increased weakness and/or abnormal muscle fatigability, general fatigue and pain, after a period of stability in individuals who had paralytic polio many years earlier. It is suspected to be the second degeneration of the enlarged motor units formed during recovery, and another denervation of muscle fibers. The cause of this denervation is unknown, but an inflammatory process could be responsible. Diagnosis is based on the presence of a lower motor neuron disorder that is supported by neurophysiological findings, in the absence of other disorders as causes of the new symptoms. Management of patients with postpolio syndrome should be multiprofessional and multidisciplinary in approach.  Individuals with postpolio syndrome should be counseled on avoidance of inactivity and overuse of weak muscles. Proper evaluation of the patients for the need of orthoses and assistive devices is mandatory. This review paper also recommends creation of State centers with comprehensive expertise in the management of all aspects of PPS.

The relationship between PD and depression has not been fully established. Some investigators have suggested that depressive symptoms in PD are causally related to the underlying neuropathological process, affecting predominantly serotoninergic and dopaminergic pathways. Alternatively, depression in PD may represent a normal reaction to the progressive physical impairment induced by the disease. Otherwise, up to 20% of parkinsonian patients present levodopa-induced psychiatric complications.

      "title": "SLEEP DISORDERS IN NEUROLOGICAL PRACTICE: A ROLE OF MELATONIN IN THERAPY FOR PRIMARY SLEEP AND AWAKENING DISORDERS IN PATIENTS WITH PARKINSON’S DISEASE",
      "abstract": "Sleep and awakening disorders are almost obligate manifestations of Parkinson’s disease. Primary sleep and awakening disorders in Par-kinson’s disease are associated with the degeneration of serotoninergic neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus and cholinergic neurons in the pedunculopontine nucleus. Impaired awakening maintenance with the development of hypersomnia may result from neuron degeneration in the locus coeruleus or pedunculopontine nucleus. A certain role may be played by the pathological basal ganglionic pulsation caused by striatal dopamine deficiency, which goes to both the thalamic reticular nucleus and pedunculopontine nucleus, as well as by dysfunction of the mesocortical dopaminergic pathways involved in sleep-wake cycle regulation. Synthetic melatonin (Melaxen) is one of the effective medications for the treatment of sleep disorders in Parkinson’s disease. The drug normalizes circadian rhythms and has a hypnotic effect although it is in the usual sense not a soporific agent. Melaxen has a minimum of side effects and is well tolerated by patients from different age groups.",

It is proposed that integrating knowledge from the neurosciences (especially neuropsychology) with psychodynamic insights (especially those of C.G. Jung) of the person with PD can play an important role in sustaining their resiliency and, in so doing, provides clinically relevant psychological care.",

People also relate to each other in interaction by watching each other’s facial expressions. The face of people with Parkinson’s disease gradually rigidifies as a consequence of a lack of dopamine production in the brain. This life story research with people with Parkinson’s disease shows that they appear to feel impeded in their interactions with others. In their stories, the informants show five signs of what Goffman labels as ‘interaction uneasiness’. Firstly, people with the disease themselves show difficulties with expressing their inner feelings and thoughts. Secondly, they perceive signs of uneasiness in others. Thirdly, they perceive uneasiness in their interactions. Fourthly, they perceive uneasiness in the eyes of third parties. And fifthly, they feel their face does not suit in the situation they are in. In the life stories indications of three conditions of this uneasiness have been found. The primary condition is difference in labelling, either caused by the lack of a label for the unusual face, or the fear that others might interpret their rigidified facial expressions wrongly. The secondary condition is a lack of culture: lack of culture for the uncommon and lack of knowledge of the culture of Parkinson’s disease. The third condition is the minimal legitimation work undertaken by people with the disease.As a consequence of the uneasiness in interaction, people with Parkinson’s disease are inclined to five different reactions: resistance, indifference, retreat from public interactional situations as well as feelings of exclusion and banishment. Parkinson’s disease thus appears to be a threat to customary social life for people with the disease.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by motor, autonomic, and neuropsychiatric symptoms. These occur in varying degrees in all stages of the disease. Among the autonomic disorders, cardiovascular, urogenital, gastrointestinal and thermoregulatory disorders are the most relevant. Within cardiovascular disorders drop of blood pressure after orthostasis and non-dipper behavior are very important; but also the influence of cardiovascular medication. Urgency, nocturia, and incontinence are of particular note within the urological problems. Among the gastrointestinal disturbances, swallowing disorders, gastric emptying disorders and constipation are particularly noteworthy.Areas covered: Autonomic symptoms are inherent in PD, in premotor and all other stages of the disease. In this overview, the current status was summarized taking into account original articles and reviews based on relevance to the field and quality of evidence.Expert commentary: The involvement of the autonomic nervous system in Parkinson's disease is still neglected. Because of the significant effects on the quality of life and even the prognosis, appropriate diagnostics and therapy should be performed at all stages of the disease. Despite intensive scientific work the area is still not sufficiently considered and the relevance in pathology is not yet understood.",

Regardless, the olfactory deficit in PD typically ranges from moderate hyposmia to anosmia and is therefore more severe than the milder hyposmia (or even normosmia) found in patients with other Parkinsonian syndromes, such as multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy, and corticobasal ganglionic degeneration. Patients with inherited Parkinsonism also have significant deficits in olfactory function. Lastly, this chapter reviews the neuropathology of olfactory dysfunction in PD.Olfactory dysfunction in PD may precede the onset of motor dysfunction by many years. This information may become important in (1) making a clinical diagnosis of PD, (2) distinguishing PD from other Parkinsonian syndromes, and (3) making decisions regarding the utilization of potential neuroprotective therapies when they become available.This chapter reviews the nature of olfactory dysfunction in PD.

Lower-limb dystonia may be a presenting sign. Postural instability, hyperreflexia, abnormal behavior, and psychiatric manifestations have been described. The disease is usually slowly progressive. Individuals have a marked and sustained response to oral administration of levodopa (L-dopa), frequently associated with L-dopa-induced fluctuations and dyskinesias. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of PINK1 type of young-onset Parkinson disease is suspected in individuals with early-onset parkinsonism (age Management Treatment of manifestations: This disorder usually responds well to L-dopa and other dopaminergic therapies. L-dopa-induced dyskinesias can be reduced by adjusting dopaminergic therapies and by adding antidyskinetic agents. Motor fluctuations can be ameliorated by dose fractionation and by adding COMT inhibitors. As in individuals with idiopathic Parkinson disease, deep brain stimulation should be considered in more advanced cases. Prevention of secondary complications: L-dopa dosage should not exceed the level required for satisfactory clinical response. If not contraindicated, dopamine agonists should be employed to possibly delay the onset of motor fluctuations, as affected individuals often require several decades of treatment. Surveillance: Neurologic follow up including assessment of treatment effectiveness every three to 12 months. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Neuroleptic treatment may exacerbate parkinsonism. Genetic counseling PINK1 type of young-onset Parkinson disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. At conception, each sib of a proband has a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being a carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Carrier testing for at-risk relatives and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible if both pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a gradually worsening neurodegenerative disorder affecting the nervous system, marked by a slow progression and varied symptoms. It is the second most common neurodegenerative disease, affecting over six million people in the world. Its multifactorial etiology includes environmental, genomic, and epigenetic factors. Clinical symptoms consist of non-motor and motor symptoms, with motor symptoms being the classic presentation. Therapeutic approaches encompass pharmacological, non-pharmacological, and surgical interventions. Traditional pharmacological treatment consists of administering drugs (MAOIs, DA, and levodopa), while emerging evidence explores the potential of antidiabetic agents for neuroprotection and gene therapy for attenuating parkinsonian symptoms. Non-pharmacological treatments, such as exercise, a calcium-rich diet, and adequate vitamin D supplementation, aim to slow disease progression and prevent complications. For those patients who have medically induced side effects and/or refractory symptoms, surgery is a therapeutic option. Deep brain stimulation is the primary surgical option, associated with motor symptom improvement. Levodopa/carbidopa intestinal gel infusion through percutaneous endoscopic gastrojejunostomy and a portable infusion pump succeeded in reducing \"off\" time, where non-motor and motor symptoms occur, and increasing \"on\" time. This article aims to address the general aspects of PD and to provide a comparative comprehensive review of the conventional and the latest therapeutic advancements and emerging treatments for PD. Nevertheless, further studies are required to optimize treatment and provide suitable alternatives.",

The non-motor symptoms (NMS) of PD often precede better-recognized motor features in PD but are increasingly recognized, and include cognitive, neuropsychiatric, sleep, autonomic and sensory disturbances. These NMS may be intrinsic to the disease pathology, and are not confined to traditional dopaminergic pathways. For instance, cognitive disturbances are often linked to the cholinergic neuraxis, and depression may result from alterations in the serotonergic system. In addition, some NMS, particularly impulse control disorders or sleep disorders, may be triggered as a result of treatment with dopaminergic agents. Treatment may include interventions independent of traditional, dopaminergic antiparkinson therapy or may be tailored to increase or reduce dopamine responsiveness of the symptom. This chapter will highlight the importance of NMS detection in optimizing treatment of PD patients.",

In addition, influences from the medication have to be considered, which are certainly not predominant. The central degenerative process involving the dorsal vagal nucleus is certainly significant, but it does not explain the range of symptoms. Involvement of the enteric nervous system is likely to be more crucial, with PD typical changes involving the presence of Lewy bodies extending from the upper esophagus down to the rectum in the Plexus myentericus Auerbach and the Plexus submucosus Meissner [4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].

      "abstract": ": Parkinson's Disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the elderly population, with a higher prevalence in men, independent of race and social class; it affects approximately 1.5 to 2.0% of the elderly population over 60 years and 4% for those over 80 years of age. PD is caused by the necrosis of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, which is the brain region responsible for the synthesis of the neurotransmitter dopamine (DA), resulting in its decrease in the synaptic cleft. The monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B) degrades dopamine, promoting the glutamate accumulation and oxidative stress with the release of free radicals, causing excitotoxicity. The PD symptoms are progressive physical limitations such as rigidity, bradykinesia, tremor, postural instability and disability in functional performance. Considering that there are no laboratory tests, biomarkers or imaging studies to confirm the disease, the diagnosis of PD is made by analyzing the motor features. There is no cure for PD, and the pharmacological treatment consists of a dopaminergic supplement with levodopa, COMT inhibitors, anticholinergics agents, dopaminergic agonists, and inhibitors of MAO-B, which basically aims to control the symptoms, enabling better functional mobility and increasing life expectancy of the treated PD patients. Due to the importance and increasing prevalence of PD in the world, this study reviews information on the pathophysiology, symptomatology as well as the most current and relevant treatments of PD patients.",

      "abstract": "Background : The diagnostic criteria for dementia in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) remain controversial. In PD, general intelligence is relatively spared, although executive function is commonly impaired. Methods : Following the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th ed. (DSM‐IV), in this study we defined dementia in PD as a combined impairment of memory and executive function, and evaluated its incidence and its relationship with other clinical features. Results : The prevalence of dementia among patients with PD was estimated to be 20–30% in an outpatient clinic and was found to be associated with the severity of motor impairments, especially Dopa‐refractory symptoms. On the other hand, no relationships were observed between the prevalence of dementia and patient age or age of onset. Conclusion : These data suggest that cognitive deficits, comprising dementia syndrome in PD, are mainly due to common neurodegenerative processes of non‐dopaminergic systems, but not to other concomitant diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease.",

      "title": "Relationship between Sleep Quality and Cognitive Function in Patients with Mild-to-Moderate Parkinson's Disease",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common degenerative disease of the central nervous system (CNS) in middle-aged and elderly people. PD is characterized by resting tremor, myotonia, bradykinesia, abnormal posture, and gait. The incident of PD increases with age. In addition to motor symptoms, nonmotor symptoms have raised additional concerns in recent years. Cognitive impairment is very common in PD patients. It is estimated that the incidence of PD mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) is 20–50%,[1] which is present at the initial visit in some patients and a great number of patients with PD-MCI eventually develop PD with dementia (PDD). PD patients are much more likely to develop dementia than the normal population. It has been found that 2/3 of PD patients suffer from different forms of sleep disorders, which are indicated to be one of the common nonmotor symptoms in PD patients. The symptoms of various sleep disorders in PD patients include night insomnia, increased sleepiness, sleep fragmentation, reduced sleep efficiency, and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder, thus having a serious impact on the patient's sleep quality and increasing the risk of dementia.[2] Therefore, cognitive dysfunction and sleep disorders are two important nonmotor symptoms of PD, exerting greater impacts on the quality of life (QOL). Here, we evaluated the relationship between sleep quality and cognitive function of PD patients. From May 2016 to May 2017, we enrolled a total of 111 native Chinese patients with primary PD and without audiovisual dysfunction who were admitted to the Department of Neurology, the First Hospital of Hebei Medical University. The diagnosis of PD was based on the criteria of the United Kingdom PD Society Brain Bank. Moreover, the diagnosis of PDD conformed to the diagnostic criteria of dementia proposed by the Movement Disorder Society Task Force: (1) diagnosis of primary PD, (2) PD-related cognitive decline by the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), (3) cognitive impairment that affected the patient's daily life ability, and (4) development of extrapyramidal system of PD before dementia, with regular time interval. Patient information was collected by two trained neurologists, including name, sex, age, duration of illness, and educational level. Of these, duration of disease was calculated from the time the patient initially complained of discomfort. The assessment was performed since medications were initiated. The Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS) was used to assess the severity of the disease, and Hoehn-Yahr (H-Y) staging was utilized for disease rating. According to the severity, the patients were divided into stage 1.0–5.0, including mild (1.0–2.0), moderate (2.5–3.0), and severe (4.0–5.0). According to complaints of patients and their family concerning declined cognitive function and interference with daily life activities in our study, PD patients were divided into three groups as follows: normal group, MCI group, and dementia group, according to MMSE and MoCA (Beijing version) normal cognitive function. MoCA ≥26 points and denying cognitive decline was categorized as a normal cognitive function, MoCA <26 points and MMSE ≥26 as well as a complaint of decreased cognitive function but denying interference with daily life activities as MCI, and MMSE <26 and complaint of decreased cognitive function and affected daily lives as dementia. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) was used to evaluate the quality of sleep in PD patients over the pastmonth. Patients with PSQI score ≥6 points were classified as suffering sleep disorders, and patients with long-term use of sleeping pills were excluded. SPSS version 19.0 software (SPSS, USA) was used for statistical analysis. Student's t-test was used for the comparisons. The significance level was set at a value of P < 0.05. There were a total of 111 (61 males and 50 females) PD patients, with a mean age of 66.5 ± 8.7 years, a mean educational level of 11.2 ± 3.5 years and a mean duration of 6.1 ± 4.1 years. The mean H-Y staging was 2.20 ± 0.80, which was classified as mild-to-moderate PD, including mild in 59 (53.15%) patients, and moderate in 52 (46.85%) patients. Patients with PSQI ≥6 were diagnosed with having sleep disorders. There were 67 (60.36%) patients with cognitive impairment, including 30 (27.03%) with MCI and 37 (33.33%) with dementia. The MMSE score in dementia group was 23.04 ± 1.73, which was categorized as mild dementia. The results of the comparison of sleep quality in PD patients with different cognitive levels showed different sleep quality in mild PD patients with different cognitive levels, with the poorest sleep quality in the dementia group. Pairwise comparison showed that the PSQI score was significantly higher in the dementia group than in the normal group, and the difference was statistically significant (P < 0.05) [Supplementary Table 1]. Different cognitive levels in moderate PD patients were associated with different sleep quality, with the poorest quality in the dementia group. The pairwise comparison indicated significantly higher PSQI scores in dementia group than in the normal group (P < 0.01) [Supplementary Table 2]. Regarding sleep quality, no significant differences were noted in mild and moderate PD patients (P = 0.935).Supplementary Table 1: Comparison of sleep quality in mild Parkinson's disease patients with different cognitive levelsSupplementary Table 2: Comparison of sleep quality in moderate Parkinson's disease patients with different cognitive levelsWith respect to general information in PD patients with different sleep quality, there was no significant difference between the two PD groups regarding age, educational level, duration of disease, and H-Y staging (P > 0.05). However, UPDRS score was significantly higher in the sleep disturbance group than in the normal group, whereas MoCA score and MMSE score were remarkably lower than those in the normal group (both P < 0.05) [Table 1]. The correlation analysis showed a positive correlation between cognitive level and sleep quality in PD patients after controlling H-Y variables (r = 0.461, P < 0.01).Table 1: Comparison of general information in Parkinson's disease patients with different sleep conditionsPD is a common degenerative disease of CNS in the elderly. In addition to motor symptoms, nonmotor symptoms in recent years, such as cognitive decline, sleep disorders, autonomic nerve damage, anxiety, depression, psychiatric symptoms, seriously affect the QOL of patients, thereby raising additional concerns. A considerable number of people experience decreased sleep quality at the onset of early PD or before PD symptoms. Common types of sleep disorders in PD patients include difficulty falling asleep, wakefulness/sleep fragmentation, daytime lethargy, sleep-deprivation, REM sleep behavior disorder, restless legs syndrome, and sleep episodes. In addition, altered sleep parameters have been observed, including sleep structure. Those are confronted with unapparent difficulties of falling asleep, difficulties of maintaining sleep and disordered sleep structure, higher incidence of asymptomatic periodic limb movements, and REM sleep behavior disorder, adversely impacting patients' QOL. There are studies suggesting that RBD is a risk factor for cognitive impairment in PD patients.[3] As we reported, mean H-Y staging of all 111 patients was 2.20 ± 0.80, showing a mild-to-moderate PD. PQSI scale was used to assess the quality of sleep in 111 PD patients enrolled, indicating the prevalence of 54.95% in sleep disorders. PD sleep disorders have been reported to be associated with aging, the severity of illness, depression, and dopaminergic dose. There is no consensus on the prevalence of sleep disorders in PD patients based on various studies, which is, however, generally higher than our results. Several studies have shown that PD patients suffer abnormal sleep at an early stage, which is likely to worsen as the disease progresses. Even at early stage, PD patients have a significantly decreased health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) compared with their peers, and that PD impacts HR-QOL in various manners. PD at an early stage has a limited effect on HR-QOL due to relatively mild motor symptoms. Thus, the priority should be given to nonmotor symptoms. The authors of the study recognize depression, fatigue, and sleep disorders as the leading cause of the decline in HR-QOL in early PD patients.[4] The current findings reveal that a higher rate (54.95%) of sleep disorders is noted in mild-to-moderate PD patients, and sleep disorders negatively impact cognitive function in PD patients, thereby leading to further decline of HR-QOL. Sleep disorders and cognitive disorders, as the two major nonmotor symptoms of PD, interact with each other. Sleep disorders can be seen as a concomitant symptom of cognitive impairment and can lead to involvement of the brainstem nerve nucleus, thus impairing cognitive function. The current results showed that sleep disorders in PD patients were associated with a high prevalence of cognitive impairment and a marked decline in cognitive function. Consistent with the above findings, PD patients with dementia had poorer sleep quality than those with normal cognitive function, suggesting an interaction between sleep quality and cognitive function. Based on studies in the Western countries,[5] α-synuclein, Aβ protein, and tau protein have been found in multiple brain functional areas of PD patients with sleep disorders. Currently, Aβ protein and tau protein are recognized to be associated with pathological changes of Alzheimer's disease.[6] In addition, α-synuclein abnormally aggregates to form Lewy bodies, which are characteristic pathological changes of Lewy body dementia, suggesting a common pathological basis of sleep disorders and cognitive decline. This study has several limitations. First, patients enrolled had mild-to-moderate PD and MCI. Second, there was a small sample size. Third, the effect of medications patients took on sleep is not taken into account. Last, the types of sleep disorders patients suffered were not specified. Patients with severe PD should be included, and larger sample size is needed. In addition, research methods need to be improved to obtain more detailed and accurate data. Conclusively, our findings suggest that sleep disorder in PD patients can be considered as a concomitant symptom of cognitive decline, and further aggravate cognitive impairment, indicating a potential interaction. Although the underlying pathophysiological processes remain incompletely understood, the association between sleep disorders and cognitive function in PD patients may suggest a decrease in dopamine levels in the limbic system.

Most treatments are geared toward the management and relief of motor symptoms in Parkinson's patients; however, as the disease progresses, various complications can be observed. Non-motor symptoms (NMS) may arise simply from the disease itself and are highly destructive to quality of life. These symptoms include mood disorders, cognitive dysfunction, pain, sensory dysfunction, and dysautonomia. Though it is undisputed that many NMS may appear years or even decades prior to the clinical diagnosis of PD, the focus of this review will be the overt motor phase of the condition. As such, the focus of this paper is to review the major NMS found in PD patients status post-diagnosis, their etiology, as well as treatment options available for the individual NMS.",

      "title": "Disautonomia: Uma Condição Esquecida – Parte 1",
      "abstract": "Dysautonomia covers a range of clinical conditions with different characteristics and prognoses. They are classified as Reflex Syndromes, Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS), Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Neurogenic Orthostatic Hypotension (nOH) and Carotid Sinus Hypersensitivity Syndrome. Reflex (vasovagal) syndromes will not be discussed in this article. Reflex (vasovagal) syndromes are mostly benign and usually occur in patients without an intrinsic autonomic nervous system (ANS) or heart disease. Therefore, they are usually studied separately. Cardiovascular Autonomic Neuropathy (CAN) is the term most currently used to define dysautonomia with impairment of the sympathetic and/or parasympathetic cardiovascular autonomic nervous system. It can be idiopathic, such as multisystemic atrophy or pure autonomic failure, or secondary to systemic pathologies such as diabetes mellitus, neurodegenerative diseases, Parkinson's disease, dementia syndromes, chronic renal failure, amyloidosis and it may also occur in the elderly. The presence of Cardiovascular Autonomic Neuropathy (CAN) implies greater severity and worse prognosis in various clinical situations. Detection of Orthostatic Hypotension (OH) is a late sign and means greater severity in the context of dysautonomia, defined as Neurogenic Orthostatic Hypotension (nOH). It must be differentiated from hypotension due to hypovolemia or medications, called non-neurogenic orthostatic hypotension (nnOH). OH can result from benign causes, such as acute, chronic hypovolemia or use of various drugs. However, these drugs may only reveal subclinical pictures of Dysautonomia. All drugs of patients with dysautonomic conditions should be reevaluated. Precise diagnosis of CAN and the investigation of the involvement of other organs or systems is extremely important in the clinical suspicion of pandysautonomia. In diabetics, in addition to age and time of disease, other factors are associated with a higher incidence of CAN, such poor glycemic control, hypertension, dyslipidemia and obesity. Among diabetic patients, 38-44% can develop Dysautonomia, with prognostic implications and higher cardiovascular mortality. In the initial stages of DM, autonomic dysfunction involves the parasympathetic system, then the sympathetic system and, later on, it presents as orthostatic hypotension. Valsalva, Respiratory and Orthostatic tests (30:15) are the gold standard methods for the diagnosis of CAN. They can be associated with RR Variability tests in the time domain, and mainly in the frequency domain, to increase the sensitivity (protocol of the 7 tests). These tests can detect initial or subclinical abnormalities and assess severity and prognosis. The Tilt Test should not be the test of choice for investigating CAN at an early stage, as it detects cases at more advanced stages. Tilt response with a dysautonomic pattern (gradual drop in blood pressure without increasing heart rate) may suggest CAN. Treatment of patients at moderate to advanced stages of dysautonomia is quite complex and often refractory, requiring specialized and multidisciplinary evaluation. There is no cure for most types of Dysautonomia at a late stage. NOH patients can progress with supine hypertension in more than 50% of the cases, representing a major therapeutic challenge. The immediate risk and consequences of OH should take precedence over the later risks of supine hypertension and values greater than 160/90 mmHg are tolerable. Sleeping with the head elevated (20-30 cm), not getting up at night, taking short-acting antihypertensive drugs for more severe cases, such as losartan, captopril, clonidine or nitrate patches, may be necessary and effective in some cases. Preventive measures such as postural care; good hydration; higher salt intake; use of compression stockings and abdominal straps; portioned meals; supervised physical activity, mainly sitting, lying down or exercising in the water are important treatment steps. Various drugs can be used for symptomatic nOH, especially fludrocortisone, midodrine and droxidopa, the latter not available in Brazil. The risk of exacerbation or triggering supine hypertension should be considered. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome represents a form of Dysautonomia and has been renamed as a systemic disease of exercise intolerance, with new diagnostic criteria: 1 - Unexplained fatigue, leading to occupational disability for more than 6 months; 2 - Feeling ill after exercising; 3 - Non-restorative sleep; 4 - One of the following findings: cognitive impairment or orthostatic intolerance. Several pathologies today have evolved with chronic fatigue, being called chronic diseases associated with chronic fatigue. Postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome (POTS), another form of presentation of dysautonomic syndromes, is characterized by sustained elevation of heart rate (HR) ≥30 bpm (≥40 bpm if <20 years) or HR ≥120 bpm, in the first 10 minutes in an orthostatic position or during the tilt test, without classical orthostatic hypotension associated. A slight decrease in blood pressure may occur. Symptoms appear or get worse in an orthostatic position, with dizziness, weakness, pre-syncope, palpitations, and other systemic symptoms being common.O termo disautonomia abrange um conjunto de condições clínicas com características e prognósticos distintos. Classificam-se em síndromes reflexas, síndrome postural ortostática taquicardizante (SPOT), síndrome da fadiga crônica, Hipotensão Ortostática Neurogênica (HON) e a Síndrome da hipersensibilidade do seio carotídeo. As síndromes reflexas (vasovagal) não serão discutidas neste artigo. As síndromes reflexas (vasovagal) são, na maioria das vezes, benignas, e ocorrem usualmente em pacientes sem doença intrínseca do sistema nervoso autônomo (SNA) ou do coração. Por isso, geralmente são estudadas separadamente. O termo neuropatia autonômica cardiovascular (NAC) é o mais utilizado na atualidade para definir as disautonomias com comprometimento do sistema nervoso autônomo cardiovascular simpático e/ou parassimpático. Pode ser idiopática, como a atrofia multissistêmica ou a falência autonômica pura, ou secundária a patologias sistêmicas como diabetes mellitus, doenças neurodegenerativas, doença de Parkinson, síndromes demenciais, insuficiência renal crônica, amiloidose, podendo também acometer idosos. A presença de neuropatia autonômica cardiovascular (NAC) implica em maior gravidade e pior prognóstico em diversas situações clínicas. A detecção de hipotensão ortostática (HO) é um sinal tardio e significa maior gravidade no contexto das disautonomias, definida como hipotensão ortostática neurogênica (HON). Deve ser diferenciada das hipotensões por hipovolemia ou medicamentosas, chamadas de hipotensão ortostática não neurogênica (HONN). A HO pode decorrer de causas benignas, como a hipovolemia aguda, crônica, ou ao uso de diversos fármacos. Esses fármacos podem, entretanto, apenas desmascarar quadros subclínicos de disautonomia. Deve-se reavaliar todos os fármacos de pacientes com quadros disautonômicos. O diagnóstico preciso de NAC e a investigação do envolvimento de outros órgãos ou sistemas é de extrema importância na suspeita clínica de uma pandisautonomia. No diabético, além da idade e do tempo de doença, outros fatores estão associados a maior ocorrência de NAC, como descontrole glicêmico, hipertensão, dislipidemia e obesidade. Entre os pacientes diabéticos, 38–44% podem evoluir com disautonomia, com implicações prognósticas e maior mortalidade cardiovascular. Nas etapas iniciais da DM, a disfunção autonômica envolve o sistema parassimpático, posteriormente o simpático e mais tardiamente manifesta-se com hipotensão ortostática. Os testes de Valsalva, respiratório e ortostático (30:15) são os métodos de padrão ouro para o diagnóstico de NAC. Eles podem ser associados aos testes de variabilidade RR no domínio do tempo, e principalmente da frequência, para aumento da sensibilidade (protocolo dos 7 testes). Esses testes podem detectar alterações iniciais ou subclínicas e avaliar a gravidade e o prognóstico. O teste de inclinação (tilt test) não deve ser o exame de escolha para investigação de NAC em fase inicial, pois detecta casos em fases mais avançadas. A resposta no tilt com padrão disautonômico (queda gradativa da pressão arterial sem aumento da frequência cardíaca) pode sugerir NAC. O tratamento dos pacientes em fases moderadas a avançadas das disautonomias é bastante complexo e muitas vezes refratário, necessitando de avaliação especializada e multidisciplinar. Não há cura para a maioria das disautonomias em fase tardia. Os pacientes com HON podem evoluir com hipertensão supina em mais de 50% dos casos, representando um grande desafio terapêutico. O risco imediato e as consequências da HO devem ter preferência sobre os riscos mais tardios da hipertensão supina e valores maiores que 160/90 mmHg são toleráveis. Medidas como dormir com a cabeceira elevada (20–30 cm), não levantar à noite, uso de anti-hipertensivo de ação curta noturna para casos mais severos, como a losartana, captopril, clonidina ou adesivos de nitratos, podem ser necessários e efetivos em alguns casos. As medidas preventivas como cuidados posturais, boa hidratação, maior ingesta de sal, uso de meias e cintas abdominais compressoras, refeições fracionadas, atividade física supervisionada principalmente sentada, deitada ou exercícios na água são etapas importantes no tratamento. Diversos fármacos podem ser usados para HON sintomática, principalmente a fludrocortisona, a midodrina e a droxidopa. Esses últimas não estão disponíveis no Brasil. O risco de exacerbação ou desencadeamento de hipertensão supina deve ser considerado. A síndrome da fadiga crônica representa uma forma de disautonomia e tem sido renomeada como doença sistêmica de intolerância ao exercício, com novos critérios diagnósticos: 1 - Fadiga inexplicada, levando a incapacidade para o trabalho por mais que 6 meses; 2 - Mal-estar após exercício; 3 - Sono não reparador; 4 - Mais um dos seguintes achados: comprometimento cognitivo ou intolerância ortostática. Várias patologias na atualidade têm evoluído com fadiga crônica, sendo denominadas de doenças crônicas associadas a fadiga crônica. A síndrome postural ortostática taquicardizante (SPOT), outra forma de apresentação das síndromes disautonômicas, é caracterizada por elevação sustentada da frequência cardíaca (FC) ≥30 bpm (≥40 bpm se <20 anos) ou FC ≥120 bpm, nos primeiros 10 minutos em posição ortostática ou durante o tilt test, sem hipotensão ortostática clássica associada. Pode ocorrer leve redução na pressão arterial. Os sintomas manifestam-se ou pioram em posição ortostática, sendo comuns a tontura, fraqueza, pré-síncope, palpitações, além de outros sintomas sistêmicos.",

The potential for psychogenic factors to confuse the differential neurologic diagnosis of speech disorders is emphasised.",

      "title": "Epilepsy in children and anesthesia",
      "abstract": "Epilepsy, also called seizure disorder, is the most common childhood brain disorder in the United States. The aetiology of epilepsy in children is multifactorial with congenital, metabolic, infective, and problems associated with prematurity being common causes. Nearly 3 million Americans have epilepsy. About 450,000 of them are under 17 years old. About 1 in 200 children (0.5%) have epilepsy, a neurological condition where children have a predisposition to recurrent, unprovoked seizures. There are many different types of epilepsy, especially in infancy, childhood and adolescence. Epilepsy can be thought of in terms of either: the site of seizure origin in the brain (generalised or focal seizures), or the underlying cause. Genetic epilepsies (formerly called idiopathic or primary epilepsies) occur in an otherwise normal person and are due to a genetic predisposition to seizures. Some epilepsies are due to an underlying abnormality of the brain structure or chemistry (formerly called symptomatic or secondary epilepsies). Other epilepsies have no known cause. Epilepsy is commonly diagnosed in children and can be confused with other conditions. An accurate diagnosis is essential. A seizure is an excessive surge of electrical activity in the brain that can cause a variety of symptoms, depending on which parts of the brain are involved. Seizures can be provoked or unprovoked. Provoked seizures, caused by fever in a young child or severe hypoglycemia, are not considered to be forms of epilepsy. Unprovoked seizures have no clear cause but can be related to genetics or brain injury. When a child has two or more unprovoked seizures, epilepsy is often the diagnosis. Despite advances in antiepileptic medication therapy, a significant number of pediatric patients with epilepsy have seizures that are not well controlled. Antiepileptic medications interact with anesthetic agents, and common anesthetics can precipitate or suppress seizure activity. There are important pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between AEDs and drugs commonly used in anaesthesia. These affect both drug efficacy and the risk of seizure activity intraoperatively.",

      "abstract": "Absztrakt: A Lewy-testes demencia (DLB) és a Parkinson-kórhoz társuló demencia (PDD) számos klinikai, patofiziológiai és morfológiai átfedést mutató neurodegeneratív kórkép. Neuropatológiai szempontból meghatározó a kóros α-szinuklein-aggregátumokat tartalmazó Lewy-testek (LB) jelenléte. DLB-ben nagyszámú LB található a corticalis régiókban, míg PDD-ben elsősorban a subcorticalis területek érintettek. Továbbá, DLB-ben gyakoribb az Alzheimer-kórra (AD) jellegzetes β-amyloid-plakkok és neurofibrillaris kötegek megjelenése. A mai napig vitatott, hogy valóban két külön betegségről vagy egyazon kórkép különböző megnyilvánulásairól van-e szó. A klinikai diagnózis alapja a motoros és a kognitív tünetek megjelenése között eltelt idő: DLB-ben a demencia gyakran a parkinsonizmus előtt jelentkezik, míg PDD-ben a motoros tünetek alakulnak ki korábban. Az egyre pontosabb képalkotó módszerek alapján DLB-ben nagyobb mértékű a corticalis károsodás, a kolinerg deficit, valamint a társuló AD-patológia, mint PDD-ben. Terápiás szempontból a PDD-ben gyakran használt levodopa DLB-ben kevésbé hatékony, sőt növelheti a pszichózis kialakulásának kockázatát, a betegség magtüneteihez tartozó hallucinációk és viselkedési tünetek kezelése pedig a jelentős antipszichotikum-hiperszenzitivitás miatt ütközik nehézségekbe. Összefoglalónkban részletesen tárgyaljuk a kórképek jellegzetességeit a patológia, a radiológia és a klinikai tünetek vonatkozásában, külön figyelmet fordítva az átfedések, valamint a különbségek bemutatására.

      "abstract": "Die Demenz ist ein Syndrom, das eine Reihe von Krankheitsentitäten umfasst. Dazu zählen die neurodegenerativen Demenzen mit der Alzheimer-Demenz (AD) als häufigster Form überhaupt (ca. 60%), der Lewy-body-Demenz (LBD), der frontototemporalen Demenz (FTD), dem Parkinson-Demenz-Komplex und selteneren Ursachen. Die vaskulären Demenzen (vaD) und die Mischformen machen zirka je 15% aus. Hinzu kommen noch seltenere sekundäre Demenzen. Die vaD ist in ihrer Progression von der Einstellung der vaskulären Risikofaktoren abhängig. Längerer Stillstand und schnelle Progression sind möglich. Die vaD geht oft mit Gangstörungen und anderen Folgen der zerebralen Minderperfusion einher. Der Verlauf kann durch kardiovaskuläre Komplikationen stärker geprägt sein als durch die dementielle Entwicklung. Der Verlauf der Alzheimer-Demenz kann sich bei früher Diagnose über 10 und mehr Jahre erstrecken. Initial sind eher depressive Störungen zu erkennen, dann treten die kognitiven Defizite in den Vordergrund und zuletzt die Verhaltensstörungen bzw. die Pflegeabhängigkeit. Eine leichte, eine mittlere sowie ein schwere Form können unterschieden werden, wobei im ersten Fall ein selbständiges Leben noch möglich ist, später sind verbale Korrekturen und leichte Hilfen ausreichend, bei den schweren Formen wird der Hilfebedarf immer ausgeprägter. Die kognitiven Funktionen verändern sich langsam über Monate. Einmalige kognitive Tests lassen wenig Aussage über die Schnelligkeit der Verschlechterung zu. Der Mini-Mental-Status-Test nimmt um zirka 1–2 Punkte pro Jahr ab. Bei „fast decliners“ beträgt die Abnahme 3 Punkte oder mehr. In dieser Gruppe sind ein schnellerer Verlauf und ein höheres Sterberisiko zu erwarten. Eine wesentliche Differenz zwischen der mittleren Überlebensrate von AD und vaD existiert nicht. Das mittlere Überleben liegt bei etwa 7 Jahren. Der Verlauf ist aber individuell sehr unterschiedlich. Insgesamt muss damit gerechnet werden, dass zirka 10% pro Jahr in ein Pflegeheim wechseln müssen. Die erlebte Belastung der Angehörigen ist sehr hoch und wird von Außenstehenden gerne unterschätzt. Mit dem Auftreten von Verhaltensstörungen wird die Versorgung der Betroffenen schwerer sowie die Belastung der Angehörigen sehr viel höher als wenn die Kranken ruhig und kooperativ sind.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a long-term degenerative disorder of the central nervous system. Parkinson's disease typically occurs in people over the age of 60, of which about one percent are affected. Clinical features of Parkinson's disease consist of motor and non-motor disorders. Motor disorders include such symptoms as tremor, hypokinesia, rigidity, postural instability. Non-motor disorders include cognitive and emotional impairments, vegetative disturbance. There is no cure for Parkinson's disease, treatment is directed at improving symptoms. There are medication and non-medicated methods of treatment in Parkinson's disease. In earlier stages of Parkinson's disease dopamine agonists and monoamine oxidase type B can be very efficacious in relieving motor symptoms. The most effective therapy for Parkinson's disease is levodopa, which is converted to dopamine in the brain. Levodopa can lead to unpleasant side effects, such as shortened response to each dose, painful cramps, and involuntary movements; its use is often delayed until motor impairment is more severe. For some individuals with advanced, unmanageable motor symptoms, surgery may be an option - deep brain stimulation (DBS), when the surgeon implants electrodes to stimulate areas of the brain involved in movement. In another type of surgery, specific areas in the brain that cause Parkinson's symptoms are destroyed. External brain stimulation is one of the modern and high-technology method. This study presents results of mobile personified complex therapy with external brain stimulation in patients with parkinsonism.",

Parkinsonism is associated with negative outcomes in the elderly and there is still uncertainty about when and how to start levodopa in these conditions. The diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson disease is often not pursued in the oldest old. The coexistence of both motor and cognitive impairment is the strongest factor limiting the initiation of treatment with levodopa and/or dopamine agonists in a geriatric setting, given the possibility of producing psychotic symptoms, such as visual hallucinations. It seems reasonable to perform at least one attempt to administer levodopa in older persons with parkinsonism, especially when symptoms and motility disorders are evident, in order to try to obtain an improvement in walking speed and balance. Important signs that should guide treatment for Parkinsonism in older persons are the presence of &lt;em&gt;line-pipe&lt;/em&gt; rigidity and &lt;em&gt;cogwheel&lt;/em&gt; rigidity.",

These neuropsychiatric complications often become more pronounced as PD progresses and may worsen particularly during 'off-periods'. Moreover, neuropsychiatric symptoms are also frequently seen in patients with addictive behaviours, collectively called impulse control disorders, where insight is particularly low. In this narrative review, non-pharmacological as well as experimental and pragmatic pharmacological approaches are outlined to provide a deeper understanding of the best treatment strategy for these patients. Early detection as well as a tailored multidisciplinary approach is necessary to improve symptoms and ultimately the quality of life for patients and their family members.",

Prolonged visual evoked potential latencies and abnormal electroretinographic patterns, both of which respond to levodopa therapy, have been demonstrated in Parkinson's disease patients and in primates with experimental parkinsonism suggesting that retinal dopamine deficiency is an important factor in the pathogenesis of PD visual dysfunction. Abnormalities of color perception, especially in the blue-green axis, and of visual contrast sensitivity (VCS) have also been well documented in PD patients. Although VCS impairment is likely related to retinal dopaminergic dysfunction, the fact that this visual abnormality is orientation-specific raises the possibility of visual cortex involvement as well. Visual abnormalities in PD are usually clinically occult and not likely to be uncovered during a routine neurological examination or by ordinary high contrast visual acuity testing. The clinician must be aware, however, that several forms of disability ranging from gait freezing to visual hallucinations may be linked to an underlying impairment of visual function in Parkinson's disease.",

      "abstract": "WHAT IS FROZEN SHOULDER?Frozen shoulder, also known as adhesive capsulitis, is defined as \"a condition of uncertain aetiology, characterised by significant restriction of both active and passive shoulder motion that occurs in the absence of a known intrinsic shoulder disorder\". (1)Patients with frozen shoulder typically experience insidious shoulder stiffness, severe pain that usually worsens at night, and near-complete loss of passive and active external rotation of the shoulder. (2)There are typically no significant findings in the patient's history, clinical examination or radiographic evaluation to explain the loss of motion or pain.Frozen shoulder can be classified as primary or secondary.Primary idiopathic frozen shoulder is often associated with other diseases and conditions, such as diabetes mellitus, and may be the first presentation of a diabetic patient. (3)Patients with systemic diseases such as thyroid diseases (4,5) and Parkinson's disease (6) are at higher risk.Secondary adhesive capsulitis can occur after shoulder injuries or immobilisation (e.g.rotator cuff tendon tear, subacromial impingement, biceps tenosynovitis and calcific tendonitis).These patients develop pain from the shoulder pathology, leading to reduced movement in that shoulder and thus developing frozen shoulder.Frozen shoulder often progresses in three stages: the freezing (painful), frozen (adhesive) and thawing phases (Fig. 1).In the freezing stage, which lasts about 2-9 months, there is a gradual onset of diffuse, severe shoulder pain that typically worsens at night.The pain will begin to subside during the frozen stage with a characteristic progressive loss of glenohumeral flexion, abduction, internal rotation and external rotation.This stage can last for 4-12 months.During the thawing stage, the patient experiences a gradual return of range of motion that takes about 5-26 months to complete. (7,8)Although adhesive capsulitis is often self-limiting, usually resolving in 1-3 years, (9) it can persist, presenting symptoms that are commonly mild; pain is the most common complaint. (10,11)",

      "title": "The Neuropathic Diathesis, or the Diathesis of the Degenerate",
      "abstract": "I think that the foregoing statistics, and those which follow, together with the large number of cases which I quote, and which connect general paralysis with almost every form of neurotic manifestation, will prove conclusively that neurotic inheritance is a striking feature in the causation of general paralysis. I question whether a distinction between “the cerebral and the insane element” in general paralysis can be maintained. If general paralysis is not a degeneration of the mind-tissue, then the pathology of insanity has no existence, and I would say that the subtle influence for evil, which is transmitted from parents, whose brains are deteriorated by neurotic outbursts, or soaked in alcohol, or wrecked by physiological immorality, tends strongly towards such degeneration. If insanity is, as Dr. Savage says, a perversion of the ego, then a general paralytic is the in-sanest of the insane. We know that the children of a melancholic parent, for example, may develop any form of neurosis—in other words, it is not that melancholia or general paralysis, or any other definite disease, is transmitted, but that a certain tendency to deviate from normal development is transmitted. This tendency to deviate is the neurotic diathesis, and the form of its development is determined by collateral circumstances, and a certain series of collateral circumstances determine the development of general paralysis. Perhaps neurotic inheritance may mean in some cases a limited capital of nervous energy, and if this is wasted recklessly the individual breaks down suddenly and pathologically, as we all do slowly and physiologically. I would also point out that considering the number of histories of insanity which owing to ignorance or reticence we, do not receive, and considering that we never receive information as to the existence of the slighter neuroses, it is marvellous that we get so high a percentage as 51. Of the 145 general paralytics with a reliable history, 38 had a family history of insanity, 28 a family history of drink, 8 of both, 43 had a personal history of drink, 8 of a previous attack too remote to be considered, at least, according to our present ideas, as part of the disease, and the vast majority had a history of some physiological irregularity which must be considered as conducive to the creation of an acquired neurosis. We may now pass to some further statistics.",

      "abstract": "Background Although Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized primarily by motor symptoms, PD patients, at all stages of the disease, can experience cognitive dysfunction. However, the relationships between cognitive and motor symptoms and specific demographic characteristics are not well defined, particularly for patients who have progressed to requiring dopaminergic medication. Objective To examine relationships between motor and cognitive symptoms and various demographic factors in mild to moderate, PD patients requiring anti-PD medication. Methods Cognitive function was assessed in 94 subjects with a variety of neuropsychological tests during baseline evaluations as part of an experimental treatment study. Data were analyzed in relation to Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale motor scores and demographic variables. Results Of the UPDRS subscores analyzed, posture/balance/gait was associated with the highest number of adverse cognitive outcomes followed by speech/facial expression, bradykinesia, and rigidity. No associations were detected between any of the cognitive performance measures and tremor. Motor functioning assessed in the \"off\" condition correlated primarily with disease duration; neuropsychological performance in general was primarily related to age. Conclusion In PD patients who have advanced to requiring anti-PD therapies, there are salient associations between axial signs and cognitive performance and in particular, with different aspects of visuospatial function suggesting involvement of similar circuits in these functions. Associations between executive functions and bradykinesia also suggest involvement similar circuits in these functions.",

RBD is frequently associated with Parkinson’s disease (PD), Lewy body dementia or multiple system atrophy (MSA), and in several cases may even antedate the occurrence of motor symptoms by decades. When no neurologic disorder is obvious, RBD can be considered as idiopathic (iRBD). Several studies have looked at neurophysiologic and neuropsychological functions in iRBD and have found evidence of CNS dysfunc- tion during both wakefulness and sleep in a variable proportion of these patients, challenging the concept of iRBD. Identifying subjects with a high risk of developing a neurodegenerative process may be crucial in order to develop early intervention strategies. Some prospective results in iRBD showed that potential markers of neuro- degeneration are the following: 1) marked EEG slowing on spectral analysis; 2) decreased striatal 123I-FPCIT; 3) impaired color vision.",

      "abstract": "Akinesia is a delay in the initiation of voluntary movement, and bradykinesia demotes a slowing-down of a movement that is already taking place. Akinesia and bradykinesia are the main features of Parkinson's disease (PD) and the symptoms with the dosest correlation to the dopaminergic deficit. However, akinesia and bradykinesia are not specific neither for PD nor for parkinsonism. In parkinsonism akinesia and bradykinesia are more prominent in complex than in simple movements. Self-initiated movements are slower than stimulus-initiated movements. Parkinsonian akinesia and bradykinesia are influenced by (external) motivation, in contrast to slowness in pyramidal tract lesions. Typical signs of parkinsonian bradykinesia are fatigue and an increased variability. The two extremes of pathological variability may be freezing on the one hand and paradoxical kinesia on the other. Akinesia and bradykinesia are clinically evaluated using subscores of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale and timed tests. Simple devices such as the Purdue pegboard or counters for a hand tapping test are useful for evaluating bradykinesia. EMC-based evaluations allow for accurate measurements of reaction time and movement time in simple or complex movements. The triphasic pattern of agonist-antagonist-agonist bursting in a ballistic movement is preserved. Larger movements last longer because more triphasic cycles are required. Computer-based movement analysis is possible with optoelectronic or ultrasound systems or graphic tablets. These systems have a high temporal and spatial resolution. Acceleration and velocity can be calculated. Analysis of hand or finger-tapping tests using a PC keyboard allows the analysis of reaction time (correlating with akinesia), intertap intervals (correlating with bradykinesia), variability, and fatigue. In conclusion, clinical neurophysiology allows exact quantification of the kinematic parameters of akinesia and bradykinesia.",

There was no correlation between the various diurnal symptoms and the presence of uninhibited bladder contractions. Enuresis was associated with obstructive uropathy in only 6 percent of cases. Some evidence has also been presented to support the concepts of ectopic sensory receptors and abnormal sphincter inhibition. A review of the problem of pathogenesis has suggested four main areas of possible abnormality: 1. A sensory lesion producing inadequate or delayed appreciation of bladder activity. 2. Cortical and subcortical dysfunction because of inadequate arousal or defective maturation of subconscious inhibition. 3. A congenital or acquired upper motor neurone lesion causing an uninhibited bladder. 4. A similar or related lesion causing an over-inhibited sphincter. These factors probably always occur in varying combinations. Because of the lack of association between symptoms, signs and objective measurements, there is a strong case for relating diagnosis, prognosis and treatment to urodynamic assessment.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by the gradual loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), abnormal accumulation of α-synuclein (α-syn), and activation of microglia leading to neuroinflammation. Disturbances in circadian rhythm play a significant role in PD, with most non-motor symptoms associated with disruptions in circadian rhythm. These disturbances can be observed years before motor symptoms appear and are marked by the emergence of non-motor symptoms related to PD, such as rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD), restless leg syndrome (RLS), excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), depression and anxiety, changes in blood pressure, gastrointestinal dysfunction, and urinary problems. Circadian rhythm disruption precedes the onset of motor symptoms and contributes to the progression of PD. In brief, this article outlines the role of circadian rhythm disruption in triggering PD at cellular and molecular levels, as well as its clinical manifestations. It also explores how circadian rhythm research can contribute to preventing the onset and progression of PD from current and future perspectives.",

      "abstract": "Cardinal motor features of Parkinson’s disease (PD) include bradykinesia, rest tremor, and rigidity, which appear in the early stages of the disease and largely depend on dopaminergic nigrostriatal denervation. Intermediate and advanced PD stages are characterized by motor fluctuations and dyskinesia, which depend on complex mechanisms secondary to severe nigrostriatal loss and to the problems related to oral levodopa absorption, and motor and nonmotor symptoms and signs that are secondary to marked dopaminergic loss and multisystem neurodegeneration with damage to nondopaminergic pathways. Nondopaminergic dysfunction results in motor problems, including posture, balance and gait disturbances, and fatigue, and nonmotor problems, encompassing depression, apathy, cognitive impairment, sleep disturbances, pain, and autonomic dysfunction. There are a number of symptomatic drugs for PD motor signs, but the pharmacological resources for nonmotor signs and symptoms are limited, and rehabilitation may contribute to their treatment. The present review will focus on classical notions and recent insights into the neuropathology, neuropharmacology, and neurophysiology of motor dysfunction of PD. These pieces of information represent the basis for the pharmacological, neurosurgical, and rehabilitative approaches to PD.",

      "title": "Is later-life depression a risk factor for Alzheimer’s disease or a prodromal symptom: a study using post-mortem human brain tissue?",
      "abstract": "Depression and dementia are both common diseases. Although new cases of depression are more common in younger adults, there is a second peak at the age of 50 years suggesting a different pathological process. Late-life depression (LLD) is associated with dementia. However, it remains unclear whether depression represents a dementia prodrome or is a true risk factor for its development. LLD is thought to have a vascular component and this may be a possible link between depression and dementia. We hypothesised that later-life depression is a prodromal manifestation of dementia and would therefore be associated with more AD, and/or ischaemic brain abnormalities that are present in earlier-life depression or in age- and sex-matched controls. We assessed post-mortem orbitofrontal cortex and dorsolateral pre-frontal cortex from 145 individuals in 4 groups: 28 18-50-year-olds with depression, 30 older individuals (ages 51-90) with depression, 28 with early AD (Braak tangle stages III-IV) and 57 matched controls (17 early-life, 42 later-life). Levels of Aβ, phospho-tau and α-synuclein were assessed by immunohistochemistry and ELISA. To quantify chronic ischaemia, VEGF, MAG and PLP1 were measured by ELISA. To assess pericyte damage, PDGFRB was measured by ELISA. For blood-brain barrier leakiness, JAM-A, claudin 5 and fibrinogen were measured by ELISA. To quantity endothelial activation, the ratio of ICAM1:collagen IV was assessed by immunohistochemistry. There was no evidence of chronic cerebral hypoperfusion or increased Aβ/tau in either depression group. There was also no indication of pericyte damage, increased blood-brain barrier leakiness or endothelial activation in the OFC or DLPFC in the depression groups. Contrary to some previous findings, we have not found evidence of impaired vascular function or increased Aβ in LLD. Our study had a relatively small sample size and limitations in the availability of clinical data. These results suggest that depression is a risk factor for dementia rather than an early manifestation of AD or a consequence of cerebral vascular insufficiency.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Patients with advanced Parkinson’s disease (PD) show severe motor dysfunction, wearing‐off, dyskinesia, dementia, and autonomic failure. These symptoms correlate with the development of neuropathological findings such as severe nigrostriatal and non‐dopaminergic neuron loss and gliosis, and phosphorylated alpha‐synuclein (pSyn) accumulation in the central and peripheral nervous systems. In addition, there are often co‐pathological changes, including Alzheimer‐related tau and amyloid accumulations. According to Braak’s PD progression hypothesis, at the time of clinical diagnosis of PD, accumulation of pSyn‐positive structures is already widespread in the brainstem and peripheral nervous system, and in advanced PD, these pSyn‐positive structures have spread to the limbic system and neocortex. In this review, we describe the basic neuropathology of PD, with particular attention given to the Braak hypothesis and the distribution of pSyn‐positive structures in advanced PD.",

      "title": "Deficits in cholinergic neurotransmission and their clinical correlates in Parkinson’s disease",
      "abstract": "Abstract In view of its ability to explain the most frequent motor symptoms of Parkinson’s Disease (PD), degeneration of dopaminergic neurons has been considered one of the disease’s main pathophysiological features. Several studies have shown that neurodegeneration also affects noradrenergic, serotoninergic, cholinergic and other monoaminergic neuronal populations. In this work, the characteristics of cholinergic deficits in PD and their clinical correlates are reviewed. Important neurophysiological processes at the root of several motor and cognitive functions remit to cholinergic neurotransmission at the synaptic, pathway, and circuital levels. The bulk of evidence highlights the link between cholinergic alterations and PD motor symptoms, gait dysfunction, levodopa-induced dyskinesias, cognitive deterioration, psychosis, sleep abnormalities, autonomic dysfunction, and altered olfactory function. The pathophysiology of these symptoms is related to alteration of the cholinergic tone in the striatum and/or to degeneration of cholinergic nuclei, most importantly the nucleus basalis magnocellularis and the pedunculopontine nucleus. Several results suggest the clinical usefulness of antimuscarinic drugs for treating PD motor symptoms and of inhibitors of the enzyme acetylcholinesterase for the treatment of dementia. Data also suggest that these inhibitors and pedunculopontine nucleus deep-brain stimulation might also be effective in preventing falls. Finally, several drugs acting on nicotinic receptors have proved efficacious for treating levodopa-induced dyskinesias and cognitive impairment and as neuroprotective agents in PD animal models. Results in human patients are still lacking.",

      "abstract": "Aim Clinical staging in psychiatry aims to classify patients according to the severity of their symptoms, from stage 0 (increased risk, asymptomatic) to stage 4 (severe illness), enabling adapted treatment at each stage of the illness. The staging model would gain specificity if one or more quantifiable biological markers could be identified. Several biomarkers reflecting possible causal mechanisms and/or consequences of the pathophysiology are candidates for integration into the clinical staging model of psychiatric illnesses. Methods This review covers the evolution (from stage 0 to stage 4) of the most important brain functioning impairments as measured with electroencephalography (EEG), in psychosis spectrum and in severe mood disorders. Results The present review of the literature demonstrates that it is currently not possible to draw any conclusion with regard to the state or trait character of any of the EEG impairments in both major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder. As for schizophrenia, the most promising markers of the stage of the illness are the pitch mismatch negativity as well as the p300 event‐related potentials, as these components seem to deteriorate with increasing severity of the illness. Conclusions Given the complexity of major psychiatric disorders, and that not a single impairment can be observed in all patients, future research should most likely consider combinations of markers in the quest for a better identification of the stages of the psychiatric illnesses.",

Non-motor symptoms, most importantly autonomic dysfunction, neuropsychiatric symptoms and sleep problems, are prevalent in virtually all Parkinson's disease patients and influence the quality of life more than the motor symptoms. Patients may visit a variety of health care professionals, but non-motor symptoms are often missed, because physicians do not explicitly ask patients about them or do not recognise them as being part of the disease.

These disorders profoundly impact cardiovascular health, prompting an intensified exploration into the intricate interconnections between the neurological and cardiovascular systems. This review synthesizes current insights and research on cardiovascular comorbidities associated with major neurological conditions, including stroke, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis (MS), and Alzheimer's disease.The cardiovascular sequelae of these neurological disorders are multifactorial. For instance, strokes not only predispose individuals to arrhythmia and heart failure but also exacerbate pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors. Similarly, epilepsy is associated with autonomic dysregulation and an elevated risk of sudden cardiac death, underscoring the necessity for vigilant cardiac monitoring in affected individuals. Parkinson's disease manifests with orthostatic hypotension and cardiac sympathetic denervation, significantly contributing to morbidity. Additionally, multiple sclerosis and Alzheimer's disease exhibit cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction and heightened cardiovascular risk, underscoring the need for proactive management strategies.Mechanistically, these conditions disrupt autonomic nervous system regulation, incite chronic inflammation, and may share genetic susceptibilities, each contributing to cardiovascular pathology. Effective management of these complexities requires an integrative approach that includes risk factor modification, pharmacotherapy, lifestyle interventions, and comprehensive patient education.Future research directions include identifying novel therapeutic targets, conducting large-scale clinical trials, and investigating genetic biomarkers to individualize treatment strategies. By addressing the multifaceted interactions between neurological disorders and cardiovascular health, healthcare providers can optimize patient care, reducing cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in this vulnerable population.",

PSP often mimics better-known diagnostic alternatives such as Parkinson disease early on. This is especially true for the recently described “PSP-parkinsonism” variant, which comprises a quarter of cases of PSP.2 The lack of specific treatment further reduces the diagnostic imperative. Perhaps most important, there is no objective diagnostic test for PSP in its early stages.\n\nWhy buck the odds?

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common chronic, progressive, and neurodegenerative diseases characterized clinically by resting tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, and postural instability. As this disease is usually detected in the later stages, the cure is often delayed, ultimately leading to disability due to the lack of early diagnostic techniques. Therefore, it is of great importance to identify reliable biomarkers with high sensitivity and specificity for the early diagnosis of PD. In this study, we aimed to investigate whether serum expressions of mature brain-derived neurotrophic factor (mBDNF) and proBDNF can serve as biomarkers for the diagnosis of PD at early stage. One hundred and fifty-six patients with limb tremor and/or bradykinesia meeting the inclusion criteria were assigned to either ex-PD group (PD cases) or ex-NPD group (non-PD cases) and then reassigned to either po-PD group (with PD) or po-NPD group (without PD) at 1-year follow-up based on the results of the rediagnoses as performed in accordance with MDS Parkinson's diagnostic criteria. To improve early diagnostic accuracy, grouping (PD group and non-PD group) at initial visit and follow-up was performed differently and independently. Serum mBDNF and proBDNF levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The results demonstrated that serum levels of mBDNF and mBDNF/proBDNF were significantly lower in the ex-PD group (19.73 ± 7.31 and 0.09 ± 0.05 ng/ml) as compared with the ex-NPD group (23.47 ± 8.21 and 0.15 ± 0.12 ng/ml) ( p &amp;lt; 0.01 for both) and in the po-PD group (19.24 ± 7.20 and 0.09 ± 0.05 ng/ml) as compared with the po-NPD group (25.05 ± 7.67 and 0.16 ± 0.14 ng/ml) ( p &amp;lt; 0.01 for both). However, a significantly higher serum level of proBDNF was noted in the ex-PD group (235.49 ± 60.75 ng/ml) as compared with the ex-NPD group (191.75 ± 66.12 ng/ml) ( p &amp;lt; 0.01) and in the po-PD group (235.56 ± 60.80 ng/ml) as compared with the po-NPD group (188.42 ± 65.08 ng/ml) ( p &amp;lt; 0.01). In conclusion, mBDNF/proBDNF can be used as biomarkers for early stage Parkinson's disease; in addition, mBDNF plus proBDNF has better diagnostic value than mBDNF alone in the diagnosis of PD.",

      "abstract": "Neurogenic bladder dysfunction, resulted from demage to the neural structures in spinal lesion present a major problem for the patient, his environment and health care workers. Proper diagnosis of neurogenic bladder dysfunction allows you to implement appropriate treatment plan that will allow adequate emptying and prevention of complications that may endanger the patient's life. The evolution of spinal cord injuries can distinguish three phases: 1) spinal shock phase, 2) the recovery phase, 3) final phase. After spinal trauma bladder is affected mostly in two ways: 1) Spastic (reflex) bladder caused in lesion above voiding center (S2-S4 segments), 2) Flaccid (atonic) neuropathic bladder emerges in lesion at the voiding center (S2-S4) or below it, as well as lesions of the peripheral innervation of bladder, 3) Autonomic disreflection syndrome develops in patient with cervical or high thoracic spinal cord lesions, above the Th 1 segment, 4) Uninhibited neurogenic bladder develops in incomplete nerve pathway lesions in cerebral cortex, pyramidal pathway or in spinal cord-cerebral voiding control debilitate. The diagnosis of neurogenic bladder dysfunction is established by urodynamic examination, laboratory blood and urine findings as well as radiographic, computed tomography and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging of the spinal column. Bladder emptyng can be made by intermitetnt catheterization, Crede's procedure, suprapubic stimulation, smooth bladder muscle electrostimulation and by medications. The necessity of an Interdisciplinary approach to the treatment of these patients indicates all hardness in spinal cord injury patientes and consequent bladder dysfuncion.",

Zwischen der Depression und motorischer Beeinträchtigung besteht kein linearer Zusammenhang, was pathogenetisch auf eine krankheitsimmanente Ursache hinweist, am ehesten bedingt durch das Defizit von Dopamin und anderen monaminergen Neurotransmittern. Depressionen treten bei ca. 40-50% der Parkinson-Patienten auf und werden nicht immer adäquat versorgt. Zur Therapie mit Antidepressiva finden sich nur wenige kontrollierte Studien. Als wirksam haben sich trizyklische Antidepressiva und neuere Antidepressiva wie selektive Serotonin-und Noradrenalin-Wiederaufnahmehemmer gezeigt, die ein für ältere Patienten günstigeres Profil unerwünschter Wirkungen haben. Auch neuere Dopaminagonisten könnten eine therapeutische Wirkung auf depressive Symptome haben.",

When intellectual changes are suspected, patients should be examined very carefully in a relaxed situation so they do not feel they are being `tested'. The physician should be aware of the differential diagnosis of psychiatric disorders in the elderly and not simply label patients as `senile'. The elderly are subject to acute brain syndromes caused by physical illness or drug toxicity. When acute brain syndromes are excluded, the illness is as likely to be a functional one as a chronic organic brain syndrome. The most common functional illness in old age is depression. More accurate diagnosis of elderly, mentally ill patients will lead to more effective treatment and management.",

In other words, these symptoms have been considered to be categorically different from other forms of human behavior and experience, whether they occur in healthy persons or patients with other psychiatric disorders. In this paper, we advocate a dimensional approach to negative symptoms, which is supported by two main arguments. First, enduring negative symptoms can even be observed in a variety of psychiatric disorders and they are not specific to schizophrenia. Second, we review evidence that negative symptoms show a continuous distribution from apparently healthy subjects to those with a fully developed clinical syndrome. Although the evidence does not allow for a definite decision concerning the dimensional distribution of negative symptoms, it certainly justifies exploring a dimensional approach with respect to its clinical and scientific utility. Understanding negative symptoms as a variation of normal mental processes will strengthen the development of neurocognitive models and treatment approaches.",

Up to 40% of patients with Parkinson’s disease experience clinically significant anxiety. This anxiety may be a psychological reaction to the stress of the illness or may be related to the neurochemical changes of the disease itself. Antiparkinsonian drugs may have a role in the pathogenesis of the anxiety. The anxiety disorders in Parkinson’s disease patients appear to be clustered in the panic disorder, phobic disorder, and generalised anxiety disorder areas. The degree of comorbidity between anxiety and depression in patients with Parkinson’s disease is in excess of that found in patients without the disease and anxiety in combination with depression may represent a specific depressive subtype in Parkinson’s disease. As yet, there is no trial evidence as to the treatment of anxiety in patients with Parkinson’s disease.",

      "abstract": "Neurodevelopmental disorders, affective/emotional disorders and exposure to adverse life circumstances are the main sources of psychological impairment in school age children. They should be distinguished from transient psychological symptoms occurring in normal development that do not significantly affect children's emotional and social functioning. An early recognition and assessment is the first step towards adequate treatment of conditions associated with psychological impairment. Any severe or persistant behavioral or emotional symptom occurring in children should be considered a possible early sign of a neurodevelopmental disorder warranting further investigation. Neurodevelopmental disorders are generally associated with delays early in development affecting several domains (language, social functioning, emotional and behavorial regulation) and are predominant in boys. These disorders are highly comorbid and require multidisciplinary assessments and treatment plans. Emotional and behavioral conditions arising from early deprivation or maltreatment also affect various developmental domains and may have lasting consequences. Finally, many of the disorders showing rising prevalences in adolescence or early adulthood also have some developmental precursors before puberty. Progress in identification, appropriate assessment and treatment of early manifesting symptoms and conditions interfering with adaptive functioning is a major mental health issue requiring multidisciplinary competencies.",

Wichtige frühe nicht-motorische Symptome sind die Riechstörung, Obstipation, Depression und Schlafstörungen. Entsprechend des klinischen Verlaufs postulieren die Braak-Stadien, dass der neuropathologische Prozess der Parkinson-Erkrankung im enterischen Nervensystem (ENS) des gastrointestinalen Systems und im Bulbus olfactorius beginnt. Es kommt anschließend durch transsynaptischen Zell-zu-Zell-Transport zu einem rostrokraniellen Aufstieg der Parkinson-Pathologie via sympathisches und parasympathisches Nervensystem. Mit Erreichen des zentralen Nervensystems treten die für das IPS pathognomischen Veränderungen mit selektiver Degeneration der dopaminergen Neurone in der Substantia nigra pars compacta, dem Nachweis von Lewy-Körperchen, eine reaktive Gliose und eine fortschreitende zentrale Neurodegeneration auf. Die diesen Hypothesen zugrunde liegenden klinischen und pathologischen sowie Tierversuchsstudien werden in diesem Übersichtsartikel dargestellt. So konnte α-Synuclein als die Parkinson-spezifische Pathologie im Bulbus olfactorius, im ENS, in der Glandula submandibularis, im intermediolateralen Nucleus des Rückenmarks und im dorsalen motorischen Nucleus des Nervus vagus nachgewiesen werden. Mittels eines Tiermodelles, bei dem Mäuse chronisch intragastral das Pestizid Rotenon erhalten, konnten wir für das IPS klassische pathologische Veränderungen, die Entwicklung von Parkinson-Symptomen und auch einen spezifischen zeitlichen und räumlichen Ablauf der Parkinson-Pathologie auslösen.",

Bis zu 80% dieser Patienten sind nach einer Erkrankungsdauer von 10 Jahren betroffen und bis zu 90% leiden zusätzlich unter mindestens einem neuropsychiatrischen Symptom. Literatursuche über PubMed. Patienten mit Parkinson Demenz (PD) weisen eine andere Ausprägung der kognitiven Defizite auf als Patienten mit anderen Demenzformen. Primär sind bei der PD die exekutive Funktion und visuell-räumliche Erkennung, aber auch Aufmerksamkeit und Gedächtnis betroffen. Gerade auch bei Patienten mit PD manifestieren sich neuropsychiatrische Symptome wie Delir, optische Halluzinationen, Angst, Stimmungsschwankungen und Verkennungen. Symptomatische Ursachen wie eine Infektion, Dehydrierung, Elektrolytstörung oder Änderungen der eingenommenen Medikamente sollten als diagnostische Maßnahmen und zu therapeutischen Zwecken als erstes überprüft werden. Zur weiteren differenzialdiagnostischen Einordnung sollte eine körperliche Untersuchung, eine orientierende kognitive Testung und ein kranielles MRT erfolgen. Bei klinischer Unsicherheit können weitere diagnostische Maßnahmen wie eine Elektroencephalografie, Lumbalpunktion und nuklearmedizinische Untersuchungen für jeden Patienten individuell diskutiert werden. Patienten mit IPS sollten regelmäßig hinsichtlich kognitiver Beeinträchtigungen untersucht werden, um bei Zeichen einer möglichen Demenzerkrankung weitere diagnostische und therapeutische Maßnahmen frühzeitig einzuleiten. Weiterhin sollte bei diesen Patienten verstärkt auf neuropsychiatrische Symptome geachtet werden. Rivastigmin als Acetylcholinesterase-Hemmer, Neuroleptika wie Clozapin und Quetiapin sowie neuropsychologische Trainingsverfahren sind die im Vordergrund stehenden Therapieoptionen zur Behandlung der kognitiven Defizite, der Psychose und der Verhaltensauffälligkeiten.",

Presently, no pharmacological agents can prevent PD evolution or progression, while pharmacological symptomatic treatments have limited effects in certain domains and cause side effects. Identification of interventions that prevent, slow, halt or mitigate the disease is therefore pivotal. Exercise is safe and represents a cornerstone in PD rehabilitation, but exercise may have even more fundamental benefits that could change clinical practice. In PD, the existing knowledge base supports exercise as (1) a protective lifestyle factor preventing the disease (ie, primary prevention), (2) a potential disease-modifying therapy (ie, secondary prevention) and (3) an effective symptomatic treatment (ie, tertiary prevention). Based on current evidence, a paradigm shift is proposed, stating that exercise should be individually prescribed as medicine to persons with PD at an early disease stage, alongside conventional medical treatment.",

Caso clinico. Se expone el caso de un varon de 15 anos, sin antecedentes psiquiatricos personales ni familiares, que a los 5 meses de sufrir un TCE con perdida de conciencia desarrollo un sindrome psicotico cronico caracterizado por sintomatologia positiva, siendo esta resistente a todos los tratamientos psicofarmacologicos prescritos.

El TCE puede actuar como agente etiopatogenico primario (psicosis debida a un TCE) o precipitante (esquizofrenia) en los cuadros psicoticos manifestados. Los dos criterios externos que contribuyen en mayor medida a la distincion de ambos trastornos son la escasa sintomatologia negativa y la baja vulnerabilidad genetica entre las personas con psicosis debida a un TCE.

      "abstract": "Sleep disturbances are common problems affecting the quality life of Parkinson's disease (PD) patients and are often underestimated. The causes of sleep disturbances are multifactorial and include nocturnal motor disturbances, nocturia, depressive symptoms, and medication use. Comorbidity of PD with sleep apnea syndrome, restless legs syndrome, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, or circadian cycle disruption also results in impaired sleep. In addition, the involvement of serotoninergic, noradrenergic, and cholinergic neurons in the brainstem as a disease-related change contributes to impaired sleep structures. Excessive daytime sleepiness is not only secondary to nocturnal disturbances or dopaminergic medication but may also be due to independent mechanisms related to impairments in ascending arousal system and the orexin system. Notably, several recent lines of evidence suggest a strong link between rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder and the risk of neurodegenerative diseases such as PD. In the present paper, we review the current literature concerning sleep disorders in PD.",

Cognitive dysfunction in PD can be mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or dementia. MCI presents in the early stage of PD and the incidence rate is increasing with the disease progression. In some cases it can advance to dementia. The diagnosis of MCI in PD includes inclusion criteria, exclusion criteria and damage level evaluation. Non-pharmacological therapy, such as exercise and cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) can improve the symptoms of MCI in PD, while the pharmacological treatment remains to be further studied.

      "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease (PD) which currently has no cure but there are many treatment options to manage symptoms. PD is the second most common neurodegenerative condition affecting not only older people of developed countries but also in people of developed countries in their 50’s and 60’s. Though it greatly affects motor system, psychotic symptoms such as delusion, hallucination mostly develop at a later stage of disease after several years but early development at the very beginning of the course has also been reported. Delusion can also develop as an inevitable outcome of dopaminergic drugs like carbidopalevodopa, a common drug-class prescribed at the very beginning of the diagnosis increasing the availability of dopamine in the brain. It’s the clinical experience that propounded this link between psychosis and medication use. Psychosis can impact patient’s daily life in a severe manner making it more frightening and could be life threatening at times. Therefore, differentiation between the delusion as a symptom and delusion as an effect of medication onset is a crucial part of PD management.",

      "title": "Physio-Cognitive Decline Syndrome as the Phenotype and Treatment Target of Unhealthy Aging",
      "abstract": "In this era of unprecedented longevity, healthy aging is an important public health priority. Avoiding or shortening the period of disability or dementia before death is critical to achieving the defining objectives of healthy aging, namely to develop and maintain functional capabilities that enable wellbeing in older age. The first step is to identify people who are at risk and then to implement effective primary interventions. Geriatricians have identified a distinct clinical phenotype of concurrent physical frailty and cognitive impairment, which predicts high risk of incident dementia and disability and is potentially reversible. Differing operational definitions for this phenotype include \"cognitive frailty\", \"motoric cognitive risk syndrome\" and the recently proposed \"physio-cognitive decline syndrome (PCDS)\". PCDS is defined as concurrent mobility impairment no disability (MIND: slow gait or/and weak handgrip) and cognitive impairment no dementia (CIND: ≥1.5 SD below the mean for age-, sex-, and education-matched norms in any cognitive domain but without dementia). By these criteria, PCDS has a prevalence of 10-15% among community-dwelling older persons without dementia or disability, who are at increased risk for incident disability (HR 3.9, 95% CI 3.0-5.1), incident dementia (HR 3.4, 95% CI 2.4-5.0) and all-cause mortality (HR 6.7, 95% CI 1.8-26.1). Moreover, PCDS is associated with characteristic neuroanatomic changes in the cerebellum and hippocampus, and their neurocircuitry, which are distinct from neuroimaging features in normal aging and common dementia syndromes. Basic research and longitudinal clinical studies also implicate a hypothetical muscle-brain axis in the pathoetiology of PCDS. Most important, community-dwelling elders with PCDS who participated in a multidomain intervention had significant improvements in global cognitive function, and especially in the subdomains of naming and concentration. Our proposed operational definition of PCDS successfully identifies an appreciable population of at-risk older people, establishes a distinct phenotype with an apparently unique pathoetiology, and is potentially reversible. We now need further studies to elucidate the pathophysiology of PCDS, to validate neuroimaging features and muscle-secreted microRNA biomarkers, and to evaluate the effectiveness of sustained multidomain interventions.",

      "abstract": "Diseases of the peripheral nervous system are ranking a leading position among other neurological nosologies. And polyneuropathy is known as more prevalent and severe disease. Numerous scientific reports highlight issues on different pathological conditions in relation to polyneuropathy, and in particular intoxications, hypovitaminosis (isolated or as complications of certain pathological processes), infectious and hereditary diseases, paraneoplastic syndromes, metabolic disorders, allergic reactions. These diseases when uncontrolled or untreated may result in the development of complications, among which is polyneuropathy. The diagnosis of polyneuropathy is relatively not difficult, because the disease is manifested as distal symmetrical sensory and/or motor impairments with transient disorders of autonomic nervous system. Diabetic polyneuropathy, in particular, is a late complication of diabetes mellitus, which determines the prognosis of the disease. Alcoholic polyneuropathy in a form of acute, subacute or chronic current variants is caused by the combined effects of thiamine toxicity and vitamin deficiency. At the same time, dysmetabolic polyneuropathies differ by variability of clinical manifestations and the general developmental patterns of the nerve conduction block that is determined by the peculiarities of degenerative and regenerative processes under different pathogenetic factors. Differential diagnosis of polyneuropathies is mainly based on the detection of somatic pathology and the comparison of the dynamic changes in the course of the diseases and clinical manifestations. The study has demonstrated diabetic and alcoholic polyneuropathies have clear distinct clinical-neurophysiological patterns. The article also highlights the treatment outcomes of combination therapy with pregabalin for diabetic and alcoholic polyneuropathies.",

The great majority of cases of PD are sporadic, without any other family members being affected. One of the great advances in the last decade is that several gene mutations have been discovered to cause PD. But these monogenetic causes do not explain the great majority of sporadic cases. Environmental factors of an unknown nature and the combination of genetic and environmental risk factors are considered to play a role in the etiology of PD. The symptoms of PD begin insidiously and worsen gradually over time. They typically begin on one side of the body, rather than bilaterally, before eventually spreading to involve the other side. The most common initial symptom recognized by the patient is tremor of a hand or foot when that limb is at rest, called tremor-at-rest or resting tremor with a frequency of about 4 Hz. This chapter begins with discussing clinical features of Parkinson disease. The chapter then explains basic concepts related to diagnosis and differential diagnosis. The chapter concludes with a discussion on treatment options available for the PD.",

      "title": "Hypothesis: Grandiosity and Guilt Cause Paranoia; Paranoid Schizophrenia is a Psychotic Mood Disorder; a Review",
      "abstract": "Delusional paranoia has been associated with severe mental illness for over a century. Kraepelin introduced a disorder called \"paranoid depression,\" but \"paranoid\" became linked to schizophrenia, not to mood disorders. Paranoid remains the most common subtype of schizophrenia, but some of these cases, as Kraepelin initially implied, may be unrecognized psychotic mood disorders, so the relationship of paranoid schizophrenia to psychotic bipolar disorder warrants reevaluation. To address whether paranoia associates more with schizophrenia or mood disorders, a selected literature is reviewed and 11 cases are summarized. Comparative clinical and recent molecular genetic data find phenotypic and genotypic commonalities between patients diagnosed with schizophrenia and psychotic bipolar disorder lending support to the idea that paranoid schizophrenia could be the same disorder as psychotic bipolar disorder. A selected clinical literature finds no symptom, course, or characteristic traditionally considered diagnostic of schizophrenia that cannot be accounted for by psychotic bipolar disorder patients. For example, it is hypothesized here that 2 common mood-based symptoms, grandiosity and guilt, may underlie functional paranoia. Mania explains paranoia when there are grandiose delusions that one's possessions are so valuable that others will kill for them. Similarly, depression explains paranoia when delusional guilt convinces patients that they deserve punishment. In both cases, fear becomes the overwhelming emotion but patient and physician focus on the paranoia rather than on underlying mood symptoms can cause misdiagnoses. This study uses a clinical, case-based, hypothesis generation approach that warrants follow-up with a larger representative sample of psychotic patients followed prospectively to determine the degree to which the clinical course observed herein is typical of all such patients. Differential diagnoses, nomenclature, and treatment implications are discussed because bipolar patients misdiagnosed with schizophrenia are severely misserved.",

      "abstract": "Involuntary movements become increasingly common with age and often lead to considerable disability, handicap and social embarrassment. Many causes of involuntary movements can be readily treated once the correct diagnosis is established. Getting the diagnosis right in older people is often challenging even for specialists. Even the identification of conditions thought easy to classify in younger people, such as Parkinson's disease, can be very difficult in older adults. This burden of movement disorder in older people reflects the increasing prevalence of neurodegenerative and vascular disease with age as well as the growing exposure to medication and the natural history of conditions such as essential tremor, which tend to worsen with age and precipitate medical presentation later in life. A complex and poorly understood relationship exists between motor control, disorders of mood and cognitive function. In older subjects involuntary movements are often associated with gait abnormalities and poor mobility and falls may be the presenting feature.",

La gravedad del deterioro y la variedad de sintomas asociados a los trastornos del neurodesarrollo o a sindromes epilepticos especificos reflejan disfunciones focales o globales, estructurales o funcionales de las redes neuronales. La compleja relacion entre los trastornos del neurodesarrollo y la epilepsia es de menor importancia que los factores comunes que incluyen la genetica, la cognicion, la funcion motora y del lenguaje. Las encefalopatias epilepticas estan asociadas a una regresion o una ralentizacion del funcionamiento cognitivo, del lenguaje o de la conducta, y la hipotesis de trabajo aceptada es que esta es una consecuencia directa de las crisis o de la actividad epileptiforme interictal, y no de la enfermedad asociada. Los datos que apoyan la idea de que las crisis recurrentes o la actividad electrica anomala pueden provocar alteraciones especificas cognitivas, del lenguaje o de la conducta, incluso en las encefalopatias epilepticas aceptadas, todavia son objeto de debate. Los datos procedentes de los estudios en animales y la experiencia clinica de las encefalopatias epilepticas de la juventud dan a entender que hay ventanas temporales del desarrollo que son cruciales para el tipo de sindrome epileptico y para el desenlace conductual y cognitivo.

Por otra parte, y a pesar de la frecuencia con que se presentan los trastornos psiquiatricos comunes en atencion primaria, la depresion es una queja poco frecuente entre los sintomas que los pacientes relatan al medico de familia y rara vez se presentan en la consulta con sintomas que encajan perfectamente en las taxonomias psiquiatricas de diagnostico, sino que habitualmente se presentan con una combinacion de sintomas fisicos, psicologicos y problemas sociales. El medico generalista se enfrenta a una situacion dificil: ante un paciente que se presenta con sintomas fisicos tiene que diagnosticar o descartar una enfermedad fisica, diagnosticar o descartar una enfermedad mental, despistar una enfermedad depresiva comorbida con enfermedad fisica o identificar los trastornos del estado de animo subyacentes en pacientes que presentan problemas somaticos.\nEn atencion primaria se produce un importante infra diagnostico de problemas mentales y una de las causas principales que se cita es la presentacion somatica de los mismos problemas. La presentacion somatica de los trastornos mentales comunes va a ocasionar un retraso en el tratamiento, pruebas diagnosticas y tratamientos inutiles y yatrogenos, incapacidad laboral, insatisfaccion del medico y del paciente y, como consecuencia, una importante repercusion en el paciente, en la sociedad y en el propio sistema sanitario.\n Dice D. Goldberg en el prologo a la primera edicion del libro Psiquiatria en Atencion Primaria del que es editor J.L. Vazquez-Barquero (1), que los trastornos mentales se podrian clasificar en dos grandes grupos: los trastornos ?comunes?, que incluiria los trastornos ansioso ? depresivos, las fobias, los trastornos de panico?, que deberian ser tratados fundamentalmente en el ambito de la atencion primaria; y los trastornos graves, esquizofrenia, trastornos bipolares, demencias? que se tratarian en los servicios especializados, aunque su atencion sea tambien compartida con los centros de medicina general. Dentro del primer grupo estan procesos muy frecuentes en la poblacion general y en las consultas de medicina general, que en muchas ocasiones no llegan a ser diagnosticados.\nEn los ultimos anos hemos asistido a un importante cambio en la figura del medico de atencion primaria. Hemos pasado de las consultas ?de cupo? de los antiguos consultorios en las que los medicos generales actuaban de filtro y clasificacion de los pacientes hacia la atencion especializada, a los actuales equipos de atencion primaria en los que el medico generalista es figura central del sistema de salud. Esto se refleja en que para la mayoria de enfermos, el medico de atencion primaria no es solo el punto de entrada al sistema sanitario, sino tambien el profesional que realiza de forma principal su diagnostico, tratamiento y seguimiento y el que atiende las necesidades derivadas de sus alteraciones (2).\nLos pacientes atendidos en atencion primaria presentan una gran heterogeneidad clinica claramente diferente de la poblacion atendida en atencion especializada, donde los procesos patologicos han sido tradicionalmente definidos e investigados. Es importante definir e investigar los procesos que se atienden en atencion primaria y no solo aceptar lo que se define en atencion especializada. Esto es particularmente importante en esos trastornos que antes denominamos como ?comunes? y que se estudian de manera principal en atencion especializada y, sin embargo, en el ambito donde habitualmente se diagnostican y tratan estan poco estudiados. Ademas, en general, los medicos tienen una clara orientacion biologica y la maxima ?primero descartar lo organico? sigue siendo valida en general, y los trastornos mentales son habitualmente un diagnostico de exclusion.\nEl medico de atencion primaria debe actuar sobre el paciente en su conjunto; de forma integral, porque considera a la persona en un modelo biopsicosocial; integrada, porque en el proceso de atencion existen elementos de promocion, prevencion, tratamiento, rehabilitacion y reinsercion social; continuada y permanente, porque se realiza a lo largo de la vida de la persona y en todos sus ambitos; y activa porque los profesionales no deben actuar unicamente como receptores de las demandas, sino buscando de forma activa las distintas necesidades de salud, aunque estas no sean expresadas (3). En el caso de la depresion y de la ansiedad con una presentacion fundamentalmente somatica en atencion primaria, es importante remarcar dos caracteristicas del proceso de atencion, la accesibilidad del paciente al proceso asistencial y la actitud activa del profesional que facilite la expresion de los sentimientos, y no solo el registro de los sintomas fisicos. Estas caracteristicas de la atencion primaria se han considerado fundamentales en el proceso que nos ocupa y no se ha pretendido ser exhaustivos en su descripcion pues no corresponde a este trabajo el estudio de las citadas caracteristicas.\nEl presente estudio busca de forma preferente la deteccion y analisis de los sintomas fisicos que acompanan a los trastornos de ansiedad y depresion que pueden detectarse en la consulta del medico de familia. Para realizar el trabajo, en primer lugar se ha realizado una busqueda de la literatura en las bases de datos PubMed y Embase y posteriormente se ha realizado un estudio transversal en la consulta de un medico de atencion primaria del Sistema Nacional de Salud. Se ha utilizado como instrumento de criba y diagnostico psiquiatrico el cuestionario PRIME-MD®, un cuestionario de datos generales, uno de atribucion de sintomas somaticos, el indice acumulativo de enfermedad y la frecuentacion de los pacientes a la consulta en el centro de salud, que nos han permitido extraer unos datos accesorios al trabajo principal.\n Se justifica el estudio por la frecuencia de los trastornos depresivos y de ansiedad en las consultas de medicina general, con una gran repercusion en la salud del propio paciente, de la familia, de los cuidadores, de la sociedad en general y del propio sistema sanitario. Por otra parte, los sintomas somaticos son la principal causa de consulta en atencion primaria y son predominantes en cualquier consulta de medicina general. Entre los pacientes que presentan trastornos de ansiedad o depresivos se pueden observar altos niveles de sintomas somaticos, muchas veces como sintomatologia predominante o unica, con poca participacion de sintomatologia de la esfera psicologica e incluso con negacion de estos sintomas. Esta caracteristica de estos trastornos en el ambito de la atencion primaria supone una dificultad en el diagnostico, un retraso de este y consecuencias negativas: falta de eficacia de un tratamiento correcto, elevado gasto de tiempo, pruebas diagnosticas, tratamientos ineficaces y iatrogenia, tanto diagnostica como terapeutica, en un sindrome que presenta elementos cognitivos, afectivos y somaticos. Este ultimo grupo de sintomas es el que trataremos en nuestro estudio con mayor detalle.\nOBJETIVOS ? Estudiar los sintomas somaticos que se asocian a los trastornos depresivos y de ansiedad en una muestra de poblacion de atencion primaria espanola.\n? Determinar la frecuencia de presentacion de estos sintomas somaticos en los trastornos depresivos y de ansiedad, comparado con un grupo control de la misma consulta.\n? Estudiar que sintomas somaticos se asocian mas frecuentemente a los trastornos depresivos a los trastornos de ansiedad y a la situacion comorbida de ambos trastornos y determinar si existen diferencias en su presentacion.\n? Determinar si algun tipo de sintomas somaticos se asocia con mas frecuencia a los trastornos de depresion o de ansiedad.\n? Conocer la atribucion causal que los pacientes hacen de los sintomas somaticos que presentan asociados a la ansiedad y la depresion.",

Seizures caused by underlying metabolic diseases (metabolic seizures) should be particularly considered in unexplained neonatal seizures, refractory seizures, seizures related to fasting or food intake, seizures associated with other systemic or neurologic features, parental consanguinity, and family history of epilepsy. Metabolic seizures can be caused by various amino acids metabolic disorders, disorders of energy metabolism, cofactor-related metabolic diseases, purine and pyrimidine metabolic diseases, congenital disorders of glycosylation, and lysosomal and peroxisomal disorders. Diagnosing metabolic seizures without delay is essential because the immediate initiation of appropriate therapy for many metabolic diseases can prevent or minimize complications.",

      "abstract": "The side of motor symptom predominance may influence cognitive performance in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD): PD patients with right-side motor symptom predominance typically present difficulties in tasks of language and verbal memory, whereas PD patients with left-side motor symptom predominance typically present difficulties in visuospatial tasks. The current study aimed at investigating the relationship between motor symptom lateralization and cognitive performance in PD patients without the possible confounding effect of dopaminergic drugs, which may enhance or impair cognition on the basis of assessed function and disease stage. From the initial sample of 137 consecutive newly diagnosed drug-naïve (de novo) PD patients, clinical follow-ups and neurological examinations identified 108 right-handed patients with a unilateral motor presentation or a clear motor asymmetry (59 right-PD: 54.6%; 49 left-PD: 45.4%). Any cognitive difference emerged between right-PD patients and left-PD patients at this disease stage. Scores of lateralized motor impairment severity correlated with some cognitive performances: Right motor impairment correlated with a measure of set shifting (Trail Making Test B-A), and left motor impairment correlated with phonemic fluency and tasks with visuospatial material (Colored Progressive Matrices of Raven, Rey-Osterrieth Complex Figure Copy and Immediate Recall). Findings of the current study supported the conclusion that the side of clinical motor predominance scarcely influences cognition in the early untreated stages of PD, suggesting that cognitive differences between subgroups of lateralized PD patients probably may appear in more advanced disease stages.",

      "title": "Evaluating a Child with Partial Developmental Delay (ParDD), Global Developmental Delay (GDD)/Mental Retardation (MR): Clinical Expertise Based or Evidence-Based?",
      "abstract": "Developmental delay (DD) is a commonly encountered clinical problem. Nearly most children with neurodevelopmental disorders present with developmental delay. The ultimate diagnosis may take months or even years to be confirmed. The final verdict may be purely developmental with a benign outcome, or there might be slow deterioration ending up in a more sinister cause like neurodegenerative diseases. At times, the developmental course might plateau off with the final developmental outcome underachieved. With standardized assessment at a later age, these children could then be labeled as suffering from \"mental retardation (MR) or \"intellectual disability\" (ID). Thus, the crucial issue during the process of making the final diagnosis for any child presenting with developmental delay is when can one decide that an etiological diagnosis can confidently be made during the phase of development. When can one be really sure that there is no underlying organic cause to account for the developmental delay. Often than not, the clinician is faced with the dilemma of how exhaustive one should persue in investigating a case of DD, and when to stop investigating further. It is very important for us to develop a logical and practical approach in managing these DD children at the \"first\" presentation and to establish ones clinical judgment to find the \"Best timing\" for referral or diagnostic workup. The first step to the approach is the awareness and the differentiation of Partial Developmental Delay (ParDD) from Global Developmental Delay (GDD). We aim to provide the readers an understanding of a practical and evidence based approach for the diagnostic evaluation of a child with DD/MR. We hope this approach can help to improve the diagnostic yield of DD/MR.

Paraneoplastic disorders can affect any part(s) of the central (CNS) or peripheral (PNS) nervous systems (Table 17.1). Patients can be roughly grouped into those with pure or relatively pure clinical involvement of one part of the nervous system, such as cerebellar degeneration or sensory neuronopathy, and those with signs and symptoms of a diffuse and multifocal “paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis” (Dropcho, 2002; Graus et al., 2004). Several syndromes should always raise the possibility of a paraneoplastic etiology, including Lambert–Eaton myasthenic syndrome, subacute cerebellar degeneration, severe sensory neuronopathy, limbic encephalopathy, and opsoclonus-myoclonus. None of the clinical syndromes, however, have an absolute association with neoplasia, and each can occur in patients without tumors.",

Each of us is convinced of being a unique and stable individual, different from other individuals. These properties - stability ad coherence - belong to an image of ourselves that was proposed to us by the Other's look during the mirror phase. Brain focal lesions may threaten this certitude in two ways: 1) brain lesions result in deficiency, disability or handicap, which are experienced as a narcissistic injury. The patient questions himself about the image he offers to the Other's look, and, as a result, his sense of personal identity is unsettled; 2) a variety of focal brain lesions or dysfunctions may alter the activity of areas which are necessary for maintaining a stable image of the patients' body or self. This may lead patients to experience depersonalisation, autoscopy, somatoparaphrenic \"delusions\" or disturbed agency. The sense of personal identity may be disturbed during brief paroxystic or psychologically traumatic phenomena. However, this is not observed in chronic sequelae of brain lesions (e.g. right hemisphere syndrome or amnesic syndrome), even though the patients may present a broken up image of themselves.",

      "abstract": "Parkinsonova bolest jedna je od vrlo cestih neurodegenerativnih bolesti koja obicno zahvada populaciju ljudi s prosjekom od 60 godina. Muskarci obolijevaju neznatno cesde od žena. Bolest se javlja sirom svijeta bez rasne ili religijske razlicitosti. Simptomi poput bradikineze, tremora, rigidnosti i posturalne nestabilnosti uzrokuju poteskode pri izvođenju aktivnosti svakodnevnog života. Kod nekih bolesnika bolest dulje vrijeme ne utjece na sposobnost obavljanja aktivnosti svakodnevnog života. Etiologija bolesti jos uvijek nije poznata, ali se pretpostavlja da je uzrok kombinacija genetskih i okolisnih cimbenika povezanih sa propadanjem dopaminergickih neurona u crnoj tvari (supstantia nigra). Za dijagnosticiranje Parkinsonove bolesti potrebno je uzeti temeljitu anamnezu, napraviti detaljan neuroloski i opdi status, napraviti test levodopom koji ako je pozitivan služi za potvrdu dijagnoze, te PET (pozitronsku emisijsku tomografiju). Fizioterapijom se tesko može djelovati na bradikineziju, rigor i tremor jer su oni posljedica procesa bolesti, te se na njih može djelovati samo lijekovima. Segmenti na koje se može djelovati fizioterapijom su poboljsanje aktivnosti svakodnevnog života, hod, balans, postura, transferi. Cilj fizioterapije je pojavnost komplikacija dovesti do minimuma, a samostalno funkcioniranje bolesnika dovesti do maksimuma. Bolesnicima je iznimno važna podrska obitelji i njihova pomod zbog neugode radi ovisnosti o drugima i osjedaja nemodi, demencije i depresije. Dobra fizioterapijska procjena i intervencija moraju biti kvalitetne, sveobuhvatne i svrsishodne kako bi doprinjeli boljitku pacijenta. Mjerenjima i testovima kao sto su Hoehn i Yahr skala, Barthelov indeks, Bergova skala ravnoteže, Ashwortova skala, funkcionalna mjera neovisnosti evaluiramo stanje bolesnika te pratimo njegov napredak. Najvažniji oblik fizioterapijske intervencije je terapijska vježba koja ukljucuje aktivnosti koje omogudavaju bolesniku da održava i unaprjeđuje razinu izvedbe u svakodnevnim aktivnostima. Redovitim i pravilnim izvođenjem vježbi bolesniku se poboljsava opde stanje i život mu postaje kvalitetniji, a tijek bolesti se usporava. Osim terapijskih vježbi za unaprjeđenje koordinacije i balansa, proprioceptivnog treninga i hidroterapije odlican alternativni oblik vježbi su ples i Tai Chi.",

      "abstract": "Most of the patients with Parkinson's disease evaluated in formal neuropsychological studies are found to have cognitive disorders similar to those of patients with lesions in the prefrontal cortex. A large number of anatomical, physiological, pharmacological and clinical data indicate that dopamine transmission plays an important role in frontal cortical functions. We review the main types of cognitive impairment in Parkinson's disease and their response to treatment with levodopa.In studies involving the acute administration of levodopa, the results obtained with regard to the cognitive functions have been heterogeneous, since improvements, exacerbations and the absence of any changes have all been observed. This heterogeneity is affected by methodological problems deriving from the disease itself, the treatment administered and the way evaluation is carried out. Longitudinal studies show a pattern of initial improvement, followed by stability, or maintenance, over a period of 2 or 3 years and then renewed exacerbation with no response to levodopa. On occasions, patients may only respond after a certain period of continued treatment. Generally speaking, the more severe the cognitive impairment is, the poorer the response to levodopa will be.Therapy with levodopa modifies, in one sense or another, the cognitive disorders in Parkinson's disease, which indicates that the dopaminergic deficit unquestionably plays a role in these disorders. The absence of response in some patients or in some cognitive functions or the fact that it 'wears off' in most patients suggests that the dopaminergic deficit is only one of the factors in the aetiopathogenesis of the cognitive dysfunction found in Parkinson's disease.",

Two clinical questions were identified: 1) Which clinical features and diagnostic modalities distinguish PD from other parkinsonian syndromes? 2) Which clinical features predict rate of disease progression? <b>Methods: </b> Systematic review of the literature was completed. Articles were classified according to a four-tiered level of evidence scheme. Recommendations were based on the evidence. <b>Results and Conclusions: </b> 1. Early falls, poor response to levodopa, symmetry of motor manifestations, lack of tremor, and early autonomic dysfunction are probably useful in distinguishing other parkinsonian syndromes from Parkinson disease (PD). 2. Levodopa or apomorphine challenge and olfactory testing are probably useful in distinguishing PD from other parkinsonian syndromes. 3. Predictive factors for more rapid motor progression, nursing home placement, and shorter survival time include older age at onset of PD, associated comorbidities, presentation with rigidity and bradykinesia, and decreased dopamine responsiveness. Future research into methods for earlier and more accurate diagnosis of the disease and identification and clarification of predictive factors of rapid disease progression is warranted.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common cause of parkinsonism. Parkinsonism is characterized by resting tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity and gait impairment. There is no specific diagnostic test for PD and it is important for clinicians to understand the clinical signs which help to distinguish PD from parkinsonism. It is equally important to be aware of the clinical signs which can be an indication that the diagnosis is not PD. These so-called Parkinson-plus syndromes include progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), multiple systems atrophy (MSA), corticobasal degeneration (CBD), vascular parkinsonism (VP) and parkinsonism with dementia (Lewy body dementia, LBD). The differential diagnosis of parkinsonism will be discussed. Initiating pharmacologic therapy for PD must take into consideration the degree of dysfunction the patient is experiencing, the question of neuroprotection, the degree of motor response required, and the potential complications of long-term treatment. Neuropro-tective trials of coenzyme Q10 (CoQ), vitamin C, vitamin E, monoamine oxidase B inhibitors (MAO-I) and dopamine agonists do not support the use of any of these drugs for a neuroprotective effect. There is recent supportive evidence that levodopa may have a neuroprotective effect. Either dopamine agonists or levodopa may be initiated. Dopamine agonists are associated with fewer motor fluctuations and dyskinesias, while levodopa is associated with better motor performance. Initiation of therapy should be tailored to individual patients with the emphasis on symptom control, with the hope that new approaches to treatment of PD (including neuroprotection) will be forthcoming.",

This study aimed to assess the impact of clinical and sociodemographic variables on the risk of falls in individuals diagnosed with PD or other parkinsonisms. Furthermore, the investigation sought to identify potentially modifiable risk factors associated with falls within this patients group. The retrospective case-control study involved the analysis of an anonymized database comprising 735 patients with PD or different types of parkinsonism, including atypical parkinsonism, and other parkinsonism (drug-induced, vascular, parkinsonism of undetermined background). Age (OR: 1.039, p < 0.001), dementia (OR: 1.862, p = 0.012), vitamin B12 deficiency (OR: 2.667, p = 0.005), polypharmacy (OR: 2.493, p < 0.001), walking with assistance (OR: 3.248, p < 0.001), and posture deformities (OR: 2.199, p < 0.001) all contributed to falls in the study group. Additionally, patients with progressive supranuclear palsy (OR: 5.532, p < 0.001) and multiple system atrophy (OR: 4.993, p = 0.003) were significantly more prone to falls, whereas patients with PD (OR: 0.245, p < 0.001) experienced falls less frequently. Factors such as low vitamin B12 concentration and polypharmacy are potentially modifiable and, therefore, may constitute viable targets for the prevention of falls in patients with PD and other parkinsonisms.",

The nigrostriatal pathway has features resembling the peripheral sympathetic system, rather than conventional central projections of sensory and motor nuclei. Like sympathetic activity, nigrostriatal function is diffuse, tonic, and more accessible to analysis by measuring biochemical rather than electrical changes. These findings are difficult to interpret in the context of the established importance of the basal ganglia in programming movement. The role of the depletion of dopamine in Parkinsonism is also unclear; we do not even know whether the impact of the deficit is more significant in the basal ganglia, or the substantia nigra. Confusion over the actions of dopamine underlies the obscurity of the mechanisms by which levodopa produces both wanted and unwanted effects. Finally, the nature of Parkinson's disease is still an enigma: we have not identified its cause, and we do not know what influences its progress.",

      "abstract": "\"Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second commonest cause of chronic neurological disability after stroke. The prevalence of PD increases with increasing age and in the UK is ∼150 per 100 000 population with incidence of 10.8 cases of PD per 100 000 population. The mean age of onset of PD is in the seventies. The diagnosis of PD is based on the presence of bradykinesia, rest tremor, rigidity, and loss of postural reflexes all of which are likely to be asymmetrical. It is now recognised that PD is much more than a motor disorder, having a spectrum of non-motor symptoms, which may occur prior to the onset of the motor signs. The non-motor symptoms of PD may have more impact on long term quality of life compared with the motor symptoms1. Non motor symptoms include autonomic impairment (eg constipation, sweating, urinary problems, dribbling and dysphagia) psychiatric problems (eg depression, dementia, psychosis), sleep disturbances (eg sleep behaviour disorder), sensory disturbances, nutritional problems and problems of balance and falls. This chapter will focus on the depression in PD (dPD) which is the most common psychiatric non-motor symptom of PD. dPD is associated with a poor quality of life, excess disability, carer stress and treatment of depression can reduce functional disability\"",

      "title": "Parkinson’s Disease: Biomarkers, Treatment, and Risk Factors",
      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused mainly by lack of dopamine in the brain. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter involved in movement, motivation, memory and many other functions; its level is decreased in PD brain as a result of dopaminergic cell death. Dopamine loss in PD brain is a cause of motor deficiency and, possibly, a reason of the cognitive deficit observed in some PD patients. PD is mostly not recognized in its early stage because of a long latency between the first damage to dopaminergic cells and the onset of clinical symptoms. Therefore, it is very important to find reliable molecular biomarker(s) that can distinguish PD from other conditions, monitor its progression, or give an indication of a positive response to a therapeutic intervention. PD biomarkers can be subdivided into four main types: clinical, imaging, biochemical, and genetic. For a long time protein biomarkers, dopamine metabolites, amino acids, etc. in blood, serum, cerebrospinal liquid (CSF) were considered the most promising. Among the candidate biomarkers that have been tested, various forms of α-synuclein (α-syn), i.e. soluble, aggregated, post-translationally modified, etc. were considered potentially the most promising. However, the encouraging recent results suggest that microRNA-based analysis may bring considerable progress, especially if it combined with α-syn data. Another promising analysis is advanced metabolite profiling of body fluids, called \"metabolomics\" which may uncover metabolic fingerprints specific for various stages of PD. This review covers molecules that might act as the biomarkers of PD. Then, PD risk factors (including genetics and non-genetic factors) and its treatment options are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized primarily by motor symptoms, including bradykinesia, rigidity, postural instability, and tremor. Although the disease process in PD is not restricted to a specific brain area, these symptoms are mostly caused by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta resulting in a reduction or depletion of dopamine. Lewy body aggregations of alpha-synuclein in the brain are a central feature of PD pathology. These inclusions typically start in caudal areas of the brain and progress anteriorly, and may take place years prior to involvement of the substantial nigra and associated development of motor symptoms. Specifically, Braak et al.'s PD staging is based on Lewy-body distribution, which rise from the dorsal motor nucleus of the vague nerve in the medulla and in the olfactory bulb (stage 1) emerging through the subceruleus-ceruleus complex and the magnocellularis reticular nucleus (stage 2), the substantial nigra, the pedenculopontine nucleus and the amygdala (stage 3), the temporal mesocortex (stage 4), and finally reaching the neocortex (stage 5 and 6). Stage 1 and 2 were considered as pre-Parkinsonian states, stage 3 and 4 as Parkinsonian states and 5 and 6 as late-Parkinsonian states. In addition to the motor manifestations that define PD, non-motor symptoms such as sleep problems, depression, dementia and attention deficit, autonomic symptoms as abnormal heart rate variability and gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea and constipation are all well known in patients with PD. Stating the presence of at least two of the four motor symptoms resting tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, and postural imbalance typically makes the clinical diagnosis of PD, although it has been indicated that the pathological changes in the striatal dopaminergic system develop several years before the clinical appearance of PD. Further development of the pathology may result in Lewy Body Dementia. Polysomnographic (PSG) EEG data from 15 patients with PD and 15 sex- and age-matched control subjects with no history of movement disorder, dream-enacting behaviour or other previously diagnosed sleep disorders were included in this study. The subjects were all recruited from the Danish Center for Sleep Medicine (DCSM) in the Department of Clinical Neurophysiology, Glostrup University Hospital in Denmark. All patients were evaluated by a movement specialist with a comprehensive medical and medication history and a PSG analysed according to the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) standard. The diagnostic certainty for PD at Danish neurological departments has be",

Depression may occur at any stage of the disease, and consists in major depressive disorder, minor depressive disorder, and dysthymia. During the course of the disease, 50% of patients experience anxiety.

Dopamine dysregulation syndrome and impulse control disorders are not rare, and in relation with dopaminergic therapies. Impulse control disorders include pathological gambling, hyper sexuality, compulsive shopping, and eating disorder. Visual hallucinations can occur in 30% of patients, mostly induced by dopaminergic therapies.

      "abstract": "In clinical practice the term &ldquo;megacolon&rdquo; is used to indicate a marked dilatation of the cecum and the sigmoid colon (&gt;12 and 6.5 cm, respectively) (1). From a clinical standpoint, a megacolon can be classified as chronic or acute depending on its clinical presentation. Chronic megacolon typically refers to a congenital disorder in which the enteric nervous system (ENS) supplying the colon does not develop properly, thereby leaving the distal segments of the viscus without myenteric and submucosal ganglia (i.e. Hirschsprung&rsquo;s disease) (2). Other cases of non-aganglionic chronic megacolon can be secondary to variety of conditions such as Chagas&rsquo; disease and neurodegenerative diseases (e.g. Parkinson&rsquo;s and Alzheimer&rsquo;s diseases), leading to or associated with ENS abnormalities (3). The acute form of megacolon, also referred to as Ogilvie&rsquo;s syndrome, is characterized by a predominant involvement of the cecum and right colon usually affecting elderly patients undergoing surgery (e.g. orthopedic procedures) or taking medications altering gut motility (e.g. opioids or antidepressants) (4). Some forms of acute megacolon, however, can be idiopathic in origin since no underlying etiology can be identified. Patients with acute idiopathic megacolon usually have a longstanding history of constipation, often accompanied by laxative abuse, and their clinical presentation is characterized by abdominal distension and severe pain with radiological evidence of stool impacted in the colon and rectum (1, 4). The case herein reported represents an unusual form of acute idiopathic megacolon characterized by massive descending and sigmoid colon distension complicated with a volvulus in a 14-year-old boy with no Hirschsprung&rsquo;s disease. In addition, just to increase the peculiarity of this case report, the patient had an unremarkable clinical record, and never suffered from chronic constipation in the past.",

Results show that even elderly patients can make use of structured psychological interventions and change dysfunctional behaviors and cognitions. Measures specifically adjusted to Parkinson's disease are aimed at helping patients make better use of the beneficial effects of medication and counteract the possible negative effects of social and emotional stressors. Relatives need information about the disease and training to cope adequately with difficult caring situations. Future evaluation of medical treatment of Parkinson's disease should consider the interaction of psychological factors and symptom intensity. This interaction may result in momentary changes in the effects of medication because of psychological conditions. In the early stages of the disease, medication has the most positive effect, and psychological interventions should also have the most benefit.",

Understanding these disturbances to sleep is clinically important and may further our understanding of the underlying movement disorder. This review evaluates the current anatomical and neurochemical understanding of normal sleep and the recognised primary sleep disorders. In addition, we undertook a systematic review of the evidence for disruption to sleep across multiple movement disorders. Rapid eye movement sleep behaviour disorder has emerged as the most reliable prodromal biomarker for the alpha synucleinopathies, including Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy, often preceding motor symptom onset by several years. Abnormal sleep has also been described for many other movement disorders, but further evidence is needed to determine whether this is a primary or secondary phenotypic component of the underlying condition. Medication used in the treatment of motor symptoms also affects sleep and can aggravate or cause certain sleep disorders. Within the context of movement disorders, there is also some suggestion of a shared underlying mechanism for motor and sleep pathophysiology, with evidence implicating thalamic and brainstem structures and monoaminergic neurotransmission. This review highlights the need for an understanding of normal and abnormal sleep within the movement disorder clinic, an ability to screen for specific causes of poor sleep and to treat sleep disturbance to improve quality of life. Key sleep disorders also act as important biomarkers and have implications in diagnosis, prognosis and the development of future therapies.",

      "abstract": "Diagnosis of neurological and psychiatric conditions associated with disturbances of dopaminergic functioning can be challenging, especially in the early stages, and may be assisted with biomarkers such as dopamine system imaging. Distinguishing between Alzheimer's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies is a major diagnostic challenge. Clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease is straightforward with classic presentation, but accurate distinction among Parkinsonian variants may be difficult; non-Parkinson's disease conditions are commonly misdiagnosed as Parkinson's disease, and ∼20% of patients with Parkinson's disease are not clinically diagnosed despite coming to medical attention. Early and accurate diagnosis is desirable to improve management. Imaging of the dopamine transporter using single-photon emission computed tomography may be of particular utility in this regard. Abnormal imaging indicates underlying nigrostriatal neurodegeneration, supportive of a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease, atypical parkinsonism or dementia with Lewy bodies, and identifies patient groups in whom dopaminergic therapy may be beneficial. Normal imaging supports diagnosis of a condition not involving nigrostriatal neurodegeneration such as Alzheimer's disease, essential tremor or drug-induced parkinsonism and hence a different therapeutic approach. In patients in whom there was diagnostic uncertainty between degenerative parkinsonism and non-degenerative tremor disorders, baseline imaging with the dopamine transporter ligand [123I]ioflupane (DaTscan™) has shown 78% sensitivity and 97% specificity with reference to clinical diagnosis at 3 years, versus 93% and 46%, respectively, for baseline clinical diagnosis. In a Phase III trial of [123I]ioflupane in patients with initial clinical diagnosis of probable or possible dementia with Lewy bodies or non-Lewy body dementia, mean specificity for excluding non-Lewy body dementia (predominantly Alzheimer's disease) was 90.4%. Using clinical diagnosis as a reference against which to assess sensitivity and specificity of dopamine transporter imaging is a limitation, but definitive diagnosis via pathological confirmation is generally not feasible. In a series of patients with post-mortem brain examination, imaging using [123I]ioflupane has demonstrated higher sensitivity (88%) and specificity (100%) for differentiating dementia with Lewy bodies from non-Lewy body dementia than clinical diagnosis (75% and 42%, respectively). Dopaminergic system imaging may be particularly valuable in patients with clinically inconclusive parkinsonism or a clinical diagnosis of possible dementia with Lewy bodies; it is not helpful in differentiating between Parkinson's disease and atypical parkinsonism, although postsynaptic dopaminergic imaging may be of utility. Other potential uses of dopamine transporter imaging include identification of patients with premotor Parkinson's disease, monitoring disease progression in testing novel therapeutics, and as an inclusion criterion for entry into clinical trials.",

      "abstract": "Although resting tremor, cogwheel rigidity, hypokinesia/bradykinesia and postural instability usually dominate the clinical picture of sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD), both clinical and epidemiological data reveal that a wide variety of additional symptoms impair patients’ quality of life considerably, parallel to the chronic progressive neurodegenerative movement disorder. Autopsy based retrospective studies have shown that α-synuclein immunoreactive Lewy pathology (LP) develops in the locus coeruleus (LC) of patients with neuropathologically confirmed sporadic PD, as well as in individuals with incidental (prodromal or premotor) Lewy body disease but not in age and gender matched controls. Using five case studies, this review discusses the possible role of LP (axonopathy, cellular dysfunction and nerve cell loss) in the LC, catecholaminergic tract and related circuitry in the development of PD-related dementia. The contribution of noradrenergic deficit to cognitive dysfunction in PD has been underappreciated. Noradrenergic therapeutic interventions might not only alleviate depressive symptoms and anxiety but also delay the onset of cognitive decline.",

Dies führt zu Problemen bei der therapeutischen Indikationsstellung sowie zu einer eingeschränkten Interpretierbarkeit neuropsychologischer und neurophysiologischer Studien. Ein weiterer Aspekt bezieht sich auf Gemeinsamkeiten und Unterschiede zwischen sekundärer und primärer Depression. Entgegen dem klinischen Eindruck einer PD-spezifischen Depression erbrachten psychometrische Verfahren zur Depressionsdiagnostik diesbezüglich bisher nur unbefriedigende Ergebnisse. Ziele dieses Überblicksartikels: 1. Charakterisierung depressiver Syndrome bei der PD, 2. Überblick über den Forschungsstand zur Neuropathologie und Neuropsychologie, 3. Gegenüberstellung klinisch- und/oder neuropsychologischer Gemeinsamkeiten/Unterschiede zwischen sekundärer und primärer MD und 4. Konsequenzen für Forschung und Differenzialdiagnostik.",

      "title": "Anxiety disorders in Parkinson's disease.",
      "abstract": "Anxiety disorders frequently occur in association with PD and may be important causes of morbidity. Actual prevalence rates are uncertain, but estimates suggest that up to 40% of patients with PD experience substantial anxiety. This percentage is greater than expected, particularly for an elderly population. In addition, the age at onset of anxiety in PD (and particularly panic disorder) is later than would be expected from current information regarding the natural course of anxiety disorders. Virtually all of the types of anxiety disorders have been described in PD, but panic disorder, GAD, and social phobia appear to be the ones most commonly encountered. Although most patients with motor fluctuations experience greater anxiety during the \"off\" phase, this is not a universal phenomenon. Anxiety frequently develops before the motor features do, suggesting that anxiety may not represent psychological and social difficulties in adapting to the illness but rather may be linked to specific neurobiologic processes that occur in PD. Most evidence points to disturbances in central noradrenergic systems, but other neurotransmitters (e.g., serotonin, dopamine) may be involved as well. Studies suggest that right hemispheric disturbances may be particularly important for the genesis of anxiety, especially panic and OCD. Whether antiparkinsonian medications themselves contribute to anxiety needs clarification. Anxiety and depression frequently coexist in PD. It remains to be determined whether anxiety in patients with PD reflects one of the following pathologies: (a) an underlying depressive mood disorder, (b) a particular subtype of depression (atypical depression, anxious or agitated depression), or (c) an independent psychiatric disturbance. The relationship between anxiety and dementia in PD is not clear, but current evidence suggests that cognitive dysfunction is not related to the presence of anxiety symptoms in this disorder. The optimal pharmacologic treatment for anxiety in patients with PD has not been established, nor has the effect of PD surgery on anxiety symptoms.",

However, It has been recognized that nondopaminergic and non-motor symptoms are sometimes present prior to diagnosis and these inevitably emerge with disease progression, impacting on morbidity, quality of life and mortality. The non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease continue to be poorly recognized and inadequately treated in contrast with motor symptoms, and a modern holistic approach to treatment of Parkinson's disease should therefore include recognition and assessment of non-motor symptoms.

Gaucher's disease: An overviewGaucher's disease (GD) is an inherited autosomal recessive metabolic disorder, resulting from a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme β-glucocerebrosidase (also called acid βglucosidase, GCase) (EC 3.2.1.45).GD was first described as a systemic disease by Philippe Gaucher in 1882, but only in 1965 this disorder was related to the deficiency of β-glucocerebrosidase (Patrick, 1965; Brady et al.",

This category includes chorea, dystonia, myoclonus, stereotypies, tics, and tremor. 2) Hypokinetic movement disorders refers to akinesia (lack of movement), hypokinesia (reduced amplitude of movement), bradykinesia (slow movement), and rigidity. Parkinsonism is the primary hypokinetic movement disorder. Movement disorders may be further categorized into primary and secondary disorders. In primary movement disorders, the abnormal movement is the primary manifestation of the disorder. In secondary movement disorders, a broader structural, toxic, metabolic, or inherited etiologic factor is responsible for the symptoms.",

      "title": "Psychosis in Parkinson’s Disease: Current Treatment Options and Impact on Patients and Caregivers",
      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease seen in older adults after Alzheimer's disease, with increasing prevalence worldwide. Parkinson's disease psychosis (PDP) is a common, non-motor feature of PD, which increases caregiver stress and is a risk-factor for nursing home placement. In this paper we review PDP epidemiology, features, diagnosis, and treatment. PDP most often presents with sequential development of minor and then increasingly complex visual hallucinations mediated by dopaminergic-serotonergic interactions activating the mesolimbic pathway, with contributions from other structures and neurotransmitters. Appropriate evaluation of differential diagnoses for psychosis is vital before diagnosing PDP. Initial treatment should involve non-pharmacologic approaches. If these are unsuccessful and PDP symptoms significantly impact the patient's and or their caregivers' quality of life and functions, then pharmacotherapy is indicated. Pimavanserin is a recently FDA-approved pharmacologic treatment for PDP with a better profile of balanced effectiveness and safety compared to previous use of atypical antipsychotics. Early diagnosis and safer, more effective treatments for PDP should help reduce caregiver burden and enable caregivers to continue to provide care at home versus institutionalization.",

      "abstract": "The intricate mechanism of swallowing can be divided into three phases: oral, pharyngeal, and esophageal. Causes of disruptions in the swallowing process can be divided into superior (oropharyngeal) and inferior (esophageal). Neurlologic dysphagia may be caused by a disruption in different parts of the central nervous system (supranuclear level, level of motor and sensory nuclei taking part in swallowing process, peripherial nerves level and a pathology of muscle cells and spindles) or neuromuscular and muscular disorders. Neuromuscular disorders causes are: stroke, brain tumors, brain injury, bulbar and pseudobulbar paralysis, neurodegenerative diseases (amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis), tabes dorsalis, multisystem degenerations, Parkinson's disease, delayed dyskineses, Huntington's disease, myasthenia and myasthenic syndromes, myopathies and peripherial neuropathies. The correct diagnosis evaluation includes history taking, physical examination with palpation and consultations (laryngological, gastrological and neurological). Radiological esophagogram, videofluoroscopy, flexible endoscopic examination, ultrasound examination, manometry, electromyography, scintigraphy and 24 hour pH monitoring are main diagnostic procedures of dysphagia. Some of the reasons for the neurologic dysphagia may be treated by surgical and pharmacological methods. Neurlologic dysphagia rehabilitation is difficult, long-lasting and often falling far short of expected results. Primary it should include neurologic cause treatment if it is possible. According to WHO International Classification of Functioning and Health in 2001 non-invasive methods of dysphagia treatment may be divided into reconstitution, compensatory and adaptive techniques. The most popular reconstitution methods are thermal stimulation or tactilethermal application techniques. Dysphagia treatment by compensatory methods consists in various techniques of swallowing and posture changes application. Adaptive techniques include dietary changes avoiding of sustenances strengthening dysphagia and adequate dietary intake.",

Kombinationen verschiedener Parkinson-Symptome wie Gangstörung, Bradykinese, Tremor und Rigor weisen mehr als 20% aller über 75-Jährigen auf. 75% der Patienten mit einem idiopathischem Parkinson-Syndrom (IPS) entwickeln 8 Jahre nach Diagnosestellung eine Demenz. Zu einer Demenz bei Parkinson-Syndromen kommt es früh im Verlauf bei der Lewy-Körper-Demenz (LKD) und spät beim IPS, bei der progressiven supranuklären Blickparese (PSP), bei der kortikobasalen Degeneration (CBD), seltener bei den frontotemporalen Demenzen. Bei der PSP, dem vaskulären Parkinson Syndrom/der vaskulären Demenz im Rahmen einer subkortikalen vaskulären Enzephalopathie (SVE) und dem Normaldruckhydrozephalus (NPH) dominiert als Parkinson-Symptom eine Gangund Standunsicherheit (Parkinson-Syndrom der unteren Körperhälfte). Das Erkennen einer Demenz bei einem Parkinson-Syndrom sollte es erlauben, das Auftreten von Verwirrtheit und Psychosen durch Antiparkinsonika zu reduzieren (Patienten mit Demenz reagieren besonders schnell mit Verwirrtheit und Halluzinose auf bestimmte Parkinson-Medikamente). Das Erkennen von Parkinson-Symptomen bei einer dementiellen Entwicklung sollte wiederum helfen, die Inzidenz von motorischer und kognitiver Verschlechterung durch Neuroleptika zu reduzieren (Patienten mit Parkinson-Syndromen reagieren besonders empfindlich nicht nur auf typische, sondern auch auf atypische Neuroleptika).

      "abstract": "Purpose of review Diseases of the basal ganglia are common in the elderly. Although motor disturbances are usually the presenting symptom, neuropsychiatric symptoms are frequent and have important clinical consequences. This paper reviews recent studies of hallucinations, depression and dementia in Parkinson's disease and related disorders. Recent findings Dementia eventually develops in the majority of Parkinson's disease patients, and is associated with a twofold increase in mortality. Studies comparing clinical and pathological features of Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies suggest that Parkinson's disease patients with dementia are indistinguishable from patients diagnosed with dementia with Lewy bodies, except for the sequence of symptom onset, suggesting a similar biological abnormality in the two syndromes. Visual hallucinations in Parkinson's disease are associated with impaired object recognition, recognition memory and reality monitoring, and with rapid-eye-movement sleep disturbances. One trial showed an improvement of cognition in Parkinson's disease with dementia on donepezil, and open-label studies suggested that cholinergic drugs may also improve hallucinations. A negative study with sertraline supported other research, indicating that serotonergic disturbances may not be the key aetiological factor of depression in Parkinson's disease. Studies of neuropsychiatric features in patients with atypical parkinsonian disorders suggest that these common symptoms may provide diagnostic information. Summary Emerging evidence demonstrates a high prevalence and important clinical consequences of neuropsychiatric symptoms in elderly patients with basal ganglia disorders, particularly Parkinson's disease. Such findings provide clues to the underlying pathophysiology and potential treatment of these features. Large-scale clinical trials are warranted for the treatment of dementia and depression in Parkinson's disease.",

      "title": "PTSD, DEMENTIA, AND SLEEP DISORDER: A POSSIBLE ASSOCIATION",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: A recent article in this journal described three World War II veterans with cognitive impairment who presented with symptoms suggestive of post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).1 The nature and type of dementia in these patients was not specified. Fluctuating cognition is one of the three major diagnostic criteria for dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). Fluctuations are described as marked variation in a patient's cognitive or functional abilities or periods of confusion or decreased responsiveness alternating with reasonable lucidity. While identification of fluctuations is difficult, two of the reported patients had episodes of confusion and withdrawal suggestive of fluctuations. Other core features of DLB include recurrent visual hallucinations and spontaneous motor features of parkinsonism.2 The presence of any one criterion is required for a diagnosis of possible DLB, and two or more criteria are required to make a diagnosis of probable DLB. The clinical histories do not mention the presence of visual hallucinations or neuroleptic sensitivity, and the neurological examination was not reported in sufficient detail to ascertain whether these patients might have had features of parkinsonism. All three patients were diagnosed with depression before the onset of their symptoms. All also suffered from paranoid delusions. Delusions and other behavioral disturbances, while seen in the late stages of Alzheimer's disease (AD), are not common presenting symptoms. Delusions are one of the supportive features of DLB. We have recently reported the validity of the proposed clinical criteria for DLB in our clinical-pathological series.3 We found that whereas delusions had high specificity (91%) in cases with mild to moderate dementia, it had low sensitivity in the diagnosis of DLB (38%). A combination of any three major or minor clinical criteria had the best predictive value (75%) in mild to moderate disease. A subjective disturbance of sleep, including the occurrence of repetitive, stereotypical anxiety dreams, is characteristic of PTSD.4-6 The phenomenology of the PTSD anxiety dream has seemed most consistent with an underlying rapid eye movement (REM) sleep dysfunction.4, 5 Whereas near total paralysis is characteristic of the REM phase of sleep, motor activity is common in the sleep disorder seen in PTSD.6 REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a recently described parasomnia characterized by excessive and elaborate motor activities during sleep and is associated with pathological absence of muscle atonia during REM sleep. The relationship between sleep disturbances in PTSD and RBD needs further research. However, the identification of RBD-like signs in PTSD, in previous cases as well as in this series, adds to the evidence for a fundamental disturbance of REM sleep mechanisms in PTSD.4-6 Other reports have described patients with RBD presenting with or subsequently developing cognitive impairment.7, 8 Most of these patients also meet criteria for possible or probable DLB. The pattern of cognitive differences from AD in these patients with RBD and dementia is similar to reported comparisons between DLB and AD. A recent international workshop on criteria for DLB has recommended including depression and RBD as additional supportive features for the diagnosis of DLB.9 The clinical features in these patients suggest a diagnosis of possible or probable DLB. The clinical descriptions do not have features typical of other common types of dementia, such as AD or vascular dementia. It is possible that in some patients PSTD and/or RBD may either herald or present with cognitive impairment, which may subsequently evolve into DLB. Further studies with longitudinal assessments will be required to address this issue. Additional investigations utilizing as polysomnography, sleep questionnaires, and detailed neuropsychological assessments may also help in this regard. The finding of a specific disturbance of sleep unique to PTSD has significant therapeutic implications and also contributes to a better understanding of the nature of the dementia associated with the cases reported.

      "abstract": "Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), a neurodegenerative disorder that may be mistaken for Parkinson's disease early in its course, is the most common type of atypical parkinsonism. PSP is fatal; it transforms a normal person into an invalid within 5-7 years of the onset of symptoms. PSP requires a multidisciplinary approach to symptom management and treatment. The neuroscience nurse who is knowledgeable about PSP and the complex way in which it overlaps with numerous other devastating neurological diagnoses can help in achieving the correct diagnosis and treatment. The nurse must understand the disease pathophysiology and the plan of care required and is instrumental in recognizing the needs of the patient and the family.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease primarily characterized by the hallmarks of motor symptoms, such as tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, and postural instability. However, through clinical investigations in patients and experimental findings in animal models of Parkinson’s disease for years, it is now well recognized that Parkinson’s disease is more than just a motor-deficit disorder. The majority of Parkinson’s disease patients suffer from nonmotor disabilities, for instance, cognitive impairment, autonomic dysfunction, sensory dysfunction, and sleep disorder. So far, anti-PD prescriptions and surgical treatments have been mainly focusing on motor dysfunctions, leaving cognitive impairment a marginal clinical field. Within the nonmotor symptoms, cognitive impairment is one of the most common and significant aspects of Parkinson’s disease, and cognitive deficits such as dysexecutive syndrome and visuospatial disturbances could seriously affect the quality of life, reduce life expectancy, prolong the duration of hospitalization, and therefore increase burdens of caregiver and medical costs. In this review, we have done a retrospective study of the recent related researches on epidemiology, clinical manifestation and diagnosis, genetics, and potential treatment of cognitive deficits in Parkinson’s disease, aiming to provide a summary of cognitive impairment in Parkinson’s disease and make it easy for clinicians to tackle this challenging issue in their future practice.",

La ceguera, diplopia o paralisis de la mirada son los signos neuroftalmologicos mas frecuentes en el trastorno conversivo. Describimos el caso de un nino con ptosis como manifestacion de un trastorno conversivo. Metodo y resultados: Varon de 9 anos en estudio por ptosis unilateral izquierda de inicio brusco, sin antecedentes medicos relevantes. En la exploracion se aprecia ptosis de ceja y palpebral izquierda, sin alteraciones de la motilidad ocular intrinseca ni extrinseca. Dado que la exploracion no se justifica por patologia de ningun par craneal, se sospecha ptosis miogenica y se solicita estudio. Las pruebas complementarias, tales como analitica autoinmune, test de estimulacion repetitiva, etc. fueron negativas. Tras descartar patologia organica y conocer situacion emocional inestable por separacion de sus padres, es valorado por el servicio de psiquiatria con diagnostico de trastorno conversivo. Conclusion: La ptosis es una rara manifestacion del trastorno conversivo, y aun mas en la infancia. Solo hemos encontrado dos casos descritos en la literatura. Es importante descartar patologia organica, diferenciar esta patologia de la simulacion y conocerla para incluirla en el diagnostico diferencial de la ptosis. EnglishPurpose: Conversion disorder is defined by DSM-IV as a deficit of sensory or motor function that cannot be explained by a medical condition and where psychological factors are judged to be associated with the deficit because symptoms are preceded by conflicts or other stressors. Blindness, diplopia or paralysis of the gaze are the most frequent neurophthalmological signs in the conversion disorder. We describe the case of a child with ptosis as a manifestation of a conversion disorder. Method and results: A 9-year-old male with abrupt left unilateral ptosis, without relevant medical history. On exploration, present left eyebrow and palpebral ptosis, without intrinsic or extrinsic ocular motility alterations. Since the examination is not justified by pathology of any cranial nerve pair, myogenic ptosis is suspected and study. Complementary tests were negative (autoimmune analytics, repetitive stimulation test, etc.). After ruling out organic pathology and knowing unstable emotional situation by separation from their parents, it is valued by the psychiatry service with a diagnosis of conversion disorder. Conclusion: Ptosis is a rare manifestation of the conversion disorder, and even more so in childhood. We have only found two cases in the literature. It is important to rule out organic pathology, differentiate this pathology from the simulation and know it to include in the differential diagnosis of ptosis.",

All patients had prolonged CPSE lasting 36 hours or longer, as documented by clinical and EEG findings. Causes for CPSE were preexisting epilepsy with partial and secondarily generalized seizures (3 patients), vascular disease (2 patients), encephalitis (2 patients), and metabolic disease (1 patient); causes were unknown for two patients. Poor outcomes identified included persistent (lasting at least 3 months) or permanent cognitive or memory loss (5 patients), cognitive or memory loss plus motor and sensory dysfunction (3 patients), and death (3 patients). NCSE in the form of CPSE is not a benign entity. Serious morbidity and mortality may occur due to the adverse effects of prolonged seizures and as a result of acute brain disorders that precipitate the seizures.",

      "abstract": "The presence of cataplexy in people with narcolepsy has a well-documented tight association with very low or non-detectable levels of the central nervous system neuropeptide, hypocretin (also termed orexin) while levels of hypocretin are normal in people with narcolepsy without cataplexy. There is evidence to suggest that hypocretin may have an association with pain, migraines and headaches in people with narcolepsy. However, these studies have not compared findings across narcolepsy with and without cataplexy. Currently, there are no studies published to determine whether pain, migraines and headaches are just common symptoms experienced by all people with narcolepsy or whether the presence of the cataplexy symptom (and thus assumed low levels of hypocretin) exacerbates these symptoms. Also, it is unclear whether general health and wellbeing (including psychological wellbeing) is similarly affected by hypocretin levels, or may be confounded by different levels of other health symptoms, such as pain. This review poses a number of research questions that need to be explored about whether the presence or absence of cataplexy is differentially associated with different types, severity and location of chronic pain; frequency, location and types of migraines and headaches; and general health and wellbeing among people with narcolepsy. A greater understanding of the role of hypocretin in these health complaints could aid in the development of more appropriate treatments for pain, migraines and headaches amongst people with and without narcolepsy.",

The disorder is common in neurological services and frequently seen by psychiatrists working in such settings. It is often associated with chronic severe disability. The diagnosis previously hinged on the neurologist’s demonstration of the lack of disease and the psychiatrist’s hypothesis of a ‘conversion’ of stress into a physical symptom. It is now based on positive findings on neurological assessment supplemented by a psychiatric assessment to confirm the diagnosis. Comorbid anxiety and depression disorders are common. Treatment is multi-disciplinary. Explanation of the condition to the patient is a crucial initial step supplemented, where necessary, by psychological treatment (especially for dissociative or non-epileptic attacks) and physiotherapy for functional motor symptoms. The prognosis without treatment is poor once the disability is established.",

Objectives We present a literature review about the impact of psychosis on PD’s prognosis. Methods A literature review is performed on PUBMED, using the next keywords: \"Parkinson’s disease”, “psychosis” and “prognosis”. We focused on data from systematic reviews, clinical trials and meta-analysis published in English on last 10 years. Results Psychosis is a common feature of Parkinson’s disease, occurring in up to 30% of PD patients treated chronically with antiparkinsonian drugs. Visual hallucinations are the most common psychotic symptom observed, delusions being considerably less common and affecting only 5% of treated patients. Positive symptoms in PD vary across its course: early in the disease, passage hallucinations, illusions and presence hallucinations occur; later, complete visual hallucinations, initially with good insight, then without insight. Psychosis spectrum symptoms in early PD predict a decline in cognitive function at 2 years, especially visual hallucinations. There is an association between visual hallucinations and the subsequent emergence of dementia. Conclusions Current evidence highlights the role of PD psychosis as a clinical biomarker of disease stage, distribution and future progression. Early recognition and treatment of psychotic symptoms improves disease’s outcomes. Disclosure of Interest None Declared",

However, mostly due to the heterogeneity of symptoms and the complexity of the underlying comorbidities, depression can be difficult to diagnose, resulting in limited recognition and in undertreatment. The early detection and treatment of depression simultaneously with the neurological disorder is key to avoiding deterioration and further disability. Although the neurologist should be able to identify and treat depression initially, a neuropsychiatry team should be available for severe cases and those who are unresponsive to treatment. Neurologists should be also aware that in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s, different depression symptoms could develop at different stages of the disease. The treatment options for depression in neurological diseases include drugs, cognitive-behavioral therapy, and somatic interventions, among others, but often, the evidence-based efficacy is limited and the results are highly variable.

      "abstract": "In the study of the instances of the disease which I have just described, it was most clearly evident from their pathological course that their existence was intimately connected with a disturbance of some kind in the nervous system, and essentially dependent upon it. In both predisposition existed, in so far that the one (Case I.) the woman was worn out with anxiety, want of rest, etc., from nursing the member of her family who died just before the first attack of the disease, she was hysterical and nervous; in the other (Case II.) he had been subjected for years to severe responsibilities, cares, and worries, which had impaired his general health. In Case I, complete recovery took place after a certain length of time, and she remained well, until experiencing another mental emotion and shock—from business reverses—a relapse occurred. From this time on, every relapse slight or great, every recrudescence of the cutaneous symptoms, subjective or objective, could be traced to some such slight or severe mental emotion or impression, or increased worry, or care, or anxiety and furthermore the grade of the relapse, whether transient or grave, varied according to the grade of the emotion, shock, or other disturbance received. It was also constantly seen how objective manifestations constantly followed immediately upon neuralgic pains, or a hemicrania or some other evidence of sensory innervation. Still more conclusive, perhaps, of the neurotic character of the disease was the observation that diminution in the severity of the subjective and objective manifestations occurred in proportion as the patient's morale improved, and the final cessation of the pathological symptoms and entire quiescence of the disease were only obtained when the changed circumstances of the patient's life protected her against the occurrence of mental emotions or shocks and precluded the experience of annoyances, worries, or cares.

However, essential tremor is the most common movement disorder affecting older people. Although many sufferers can have very disabling symptoms it can be a very mild illness in some. Patients present with a symmetrical tremor of the upper limbs in 95% of cases. The tremor is less evident at rest, unlike the tremor of IPD, and there will be no rigidity or bradykinesia. Essential tremor is a mainly clinical diagnosis. A watchful waiting period may be tried. DaTSCAN can be helpful as the results will be normal in patients with essential tremor and abnormal in those with IPD. Vascular parkinsonism accounts for 4.4-12% of all cases of parkinsonism, although it is likely that many cases remain undiagnosed. The features are usually bilateral and symmetrical and often affect the lower more than the upper limbs. A history of previous stroke is common, as are the presence of cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes. Drug-induced parkinsonism is the second most common cause of parkinsonism behind IPD. All patients thought to have a diagnosis of possible IPD should be referred to secondary care. It would also be prudent to refer any patients whose diagnosis is unclear and where advice would be helpful on future management.",

      "abstract": "Symptoms of peripartum depression are the same as those of major depressive disorder, and include depressed mood, insomnia, anhedonia, suicidal ideation, guilt, worthlessness, fatigue, impaired concentration, change in appetite, and change in motor activity. Postpartum psychosis is much less common than postpartum depression, commonly assumed to affect about 0.1–0.2% of women in the general population. The strongest risk factor for depression during pregnancy is a history of major depressive disorder. Women with a history of anxiety disorder, postpartum depression, or other previous psychiatric disorders are also at an increased risk for postpartum depression. Untreated maternal depression during pregnancy has been associated with poorer maternal physical and psychological health and with a worse quality of life. Bipolar disorder is a psychiatric illness characterized by episodes of depression alternating with sustained episodes of elevated mood and/or irritability, which are classified as either \"mania\" or \"hypomania.\" Hypomania is an attenuated form of mania with no associated functional impairment.",

      "abstract": "Depression is one of the most frequent comorbidities occurring in Parkinson's disease, affecting up to 50% of patients. Depression is associated with severe negative symptoms and has been shown to contribute to an increased rate of decline of both cognitive and motor function, profoundly impacting on the patient's quality of life. The symptoms of depression overlap with the motor features of Parkinson's disease, making detection difficult. Moreover, the lack of specialized screening tools means that depression remains undiagnosed and untreated in a high percentage of patients. However, depression in Parkinson's disease, when identified early, can be effectively treated with a variety of antidepressant medications, improving quality of life and preserving daily function. The focus of this review is to provide an overview of current knowledge regarding depression in Parkinson's disease, followed by a practical discussion addressing the issues of the detection, diagnosis and treatment.",

Alem dos sintomas motores classicos tambem podem surgir complicacoes nao-motoras, destacando-se ai problemas cognitivos, psiquiatricos e autonomicos. Evidencias demonstram que tais sintomas nao-motores frequentemente precedem o aparecimento dos sinais motores e sao extremamente relevantes, dado o impacto negativo que causam na qualidade de vida dos individuos. Os sintomas nao-motores podem apresentar multiplas causas, dentre as quais uma possivel disfuncao do sistema circadiano. Dessa forma, diversos processos fisiologicos influenciados pelo sistema de temporizacao circadiano (STC), como o ciclo sono/vigilia podem se mostrar alterados em pacientes acometidos pela DP. O STC e responsavel pela geracao e manutencao dos ritmos circadianos, que sao oscilacoes endogenas manifestadas pelos seres vivos em diversos processos fisiologicos e comportamentais, com periodo em torno de 24 horas. Assim, e fundamental a compreensao dos efeitos da progressao do processo patogenico da DP sobre o perfil circadiano do ciclo sono/vigilia e tambem de componentes do STC, em particular no nucleo supraquiasmatico (NSQ), o principal marcapasso do sistema. No presente estudo, ratos wistar jovens (6 meses) e de meia-idade (10 meses) foram submetidos a um modelo animal cronico de DP com administracao de reserpina durante 20 dias. Ao longo do tratamento foram realizadas analises comportamentais do sono, bem como a avaliacao motora dos animais. Apos o fim do tratamento, foram realizadas analises imunoistoquimicas no NSQ dos animais. Nossos resultados mostraram que o tratamento cronico com reserpina promoveu comprometimento motor progressivo tanto nos animais jovens quanto nos de meia-idade. Alem disso, as analises comportamentais revelaram perturbacoes no ciclo sono/vigilia dos animais tratados em comparacao aos individuos controle, incluindo avanco na fase de sono e aumento na fragmentacao do sono. As analises imunistoquimicas nao permitiram observar efeitos significativos do tratamento com reserpina sobre a composicao neuroquimica do NSQ, contudo novos estudos sao necessarios para a avaliacao neuroquimica e morfometrica desse importante marcapasso circadiano na DP.",

The complete biochemistry of these dysfunctions remain misunderstood although many studies have suggested a role of the dopaminergic lesions. However, cholinergic lesions in this disease may also account for the SCFS occurrence. The present study has assessed the effects of an acute subclinical dose of scopolamine in normal controls and in PD patients who were devoid of cognitive deficit. Results indicates that PD patients but not normal controls developed a transient SCFS for the duration of the drug action. In contrast to other populations with cholinergic depletions—such as Alzheimer’s disease—cholinergic blockage in PD exacerbates specifically the dysexecutive syndrome without inducing amnesia or sedation. Such a discrepancy between these two neuropsychological profiles are discussed in terms of the specificity of the underlying cholinergic lesions.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder with heterogenous symptoms and progression rates. Some studies have classifying PD into tremor-dominant and non-tremor-dominant PD (TD-PD and Non-TD-PD), finding that TD-PD tend to have a better prognosis, slower disease progression, and lower pathological burden compared to Non-TD-PD. However, this classification does not consider the specific types of tremors, even though recent studies have shown that different types of tremors in PD might have distinct underlying mechanism. Data from 517 de novo drug-naïve PD patients was analyzed. Survival analysis was carried out including motor subtypes, rest tremor presence, kinetic tremor presence, postural tremor presence, as well as the instability of tremor presence or motor subtypes as predictors. Occurrence of 6 outcomes, including motor and non-motor milestones at follow-up, were used as the time-to-event. Both TD-PD subtype and rest tremor presence was associated with slower PD progression, while kinetic tremor presence and postural tremor presence, especially kinetic tremor presence, was associated with a faster one. Our study suggests different types of tremors are associated with distinct PD prognoses, indicating potential differences in underlying mechanisms. Further investigation is warranted to elucidate the specific mechanisms underlying different types of tremors in PD and to explain their relationship to disease prognosis.",

When these signaling pathways are deficient or interrupted (e.g., by a hypoxic-ischemic event), the neurons do not migrate to the proper areas of the brain.

O bruxismo e classificado como primario ou secundario. O bruxismo primario nao esta relacionado a nenhuma causa evidente, com evolucao a partir do seu aparecimento na infância ou adolescencia para a idade adulta. Ja o bruxismo secundario esta associado com transtornos neurologicos, como na doenca de Parkinson; psiquiatrico, nos casos de depressao; outros transtornos do sono, como a apneia; e uso de drogas, como as anfetaminas. O diagnostico do bruxismo e baseado no relato de ranger de dentes ocorrido durante o sono associado a dor ou tensao nos musculos da face ao acordar. O desgaste anormal dos dentes e a hipertrofia do masseter sao sinais que ajudam no diagnostico. Nao existe tratamento especifico ou cura para o bruxismo do sono. Uma assistencia multiprofissional pode propor diferentes linhas de tratamentos: tratamentos farmacologicos, psicologicos e odontologicos. O tratamento odontologico para o bruxismo e baseado nos ajustes oclusais, restauracao da superficie dentaria, tratamento ortodontico e placas oclusais miorrelaxantes. Objetivos: Explanar sobre o bruxismo do sono e suas complicacoes no sistema estomatognatico. Metodo: Foi realizada uma busca de artigos nacionais e internacionais nas bases de dados Pubmed, Scielo e Google Scholar entre os anos 2012 a 2018 que usaram como descritores as palavras: Bruxismo e bruxismo do sono. Conclusao: O bruxismo do sono ocorre em atividades nao funcionais do sistema estomatognatico e e reconhecido como uma parafuncao do sistema mastigatorio. O aumento de forcas proporcionado pelo bruxismo leva a cargas extras em todo o sistema estomatognatico, sendo que, como possivel resultado dessa situacao, ocorram danos a articulacao temporomandibular (ATM), musculos, periodonto e oclusao. Portanto, cabe ao cirurgiao-dentista conhecer o tema e identificar essa situacao em pacientes para que se recomende o tratamento mais efetivo em cada um deles. Mesmo com o avanco dos estudos acerca do tema, e possivel apenas minimizar seus efeitos deleterios, nao sendo capaz de evitar ou paralisar o bruxismo, mas entende-se que alguns fatores diminuem sua intensidade, enquanto outros a aumentam. Todavia, existe uma dificuldade de compreensao e controle desta parafuncao devido a sua multifatoriedade.",

Bei der Kamptokormie handelt es sich um eine ausgeprägte pathologische Rumpfvorneigung beim Stehen und Gehen, die im Liegen vollständig reversibel ist. Sie tritt bei einer Reihe von Erkrankungen auf, insbesondere aber bei Parkinson-Syndromen. Für die davon betroffenen Patienten mit idiopathischem Parkinson-Syndrom ist die Kamptokormie häufig die im Vordergrund stehende Beschwerde, die eine gravierende Einschränkung für die Selbstständigkeit und Mobilität dieser Patienten bedeutet. Zusätzlich leiden diese Patienten unter den mit der Kamptokormie häufig einhergehenden Rückenschmerzen unterschiedlich starker Ausprägung. Zumeist sind Parkinson-Patienten mit akinetisch-rigider oder gemischter Unterform im fortgeschrittenen Erkrankungsstadium betroffen, in deren Vorgeschichte sich vermehrt Erkrankungen bzw. Verletzungen der Wirbelsäule finden. Die klinische Abgrenzung zu der im Rahmen der Parkinson'schen Erkrankung häufig vorkommenden leichten Rumpfvorbeugung kann anhand der von uns neu vorgeschlagenen diagnostischen Kriterien erfolgen. Aktuelle Forschungsarbeiten belegen erstmals in empirischer Fundierung eine fokale Myopathie der paravertebralen Muskulatur als maßgeblichen pathophysiologischen Mechanismus, wobei die Ätiologie dieser Myopathie noch ungeklärt ist. Deutlich seltenere, aber wichtige konkurrierende Ätiologien sind die fokale Myositis der paravertebralen Muskulatur und eine Dystonie der rumpfflektierenden Muskulatur. Die Diagnostik zur Aufklärung der zugrunde liegende Ätiologie sollte neben Laboruntersuchungen ein EMG und Muskel-MRT umfassen und ggf. eine Muskelbiopsie. Die Therapie ist jedoch gegenwärtig im Fall der zumeist zugrunde liegenden fokalen Myopathie der paravertebralen Muskulatur immer noch wenig befriedigend. In Fällen einer Myositis ist eine Kortisontherapie indiziert, bei den fokalen Dystonien kann zunächst eine Behandlung mit Botulinumtoxin versucht werden.",

Test performance was compared against normative data, and linear regression determined significant predictors of cognitive impairment from a set of demographic and disease course variables.Frontal-type cognitive dysfunction was widespread in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease. Attention and memory were mildly to moderately impaired, whereas visuospatial function showed only subtle impairment. Older age and tremor at onset were significant predictors of poor cognitive performance.The observed cognitive impairment in patients with advanced Parkinson's disease is more than expected for normal aging. Although in apparent contrast with most previous research, reporting a greater risk of cognitive dysfunction in Parkinson's disease patients with predominant akinesia/rigidity, tremor at onset may be a marker for more widespread brain pathology that contributes to an increased risk of cognitive impairment.",

As time passes, the number of symptoms of the disease (tremor, rigor, bradycystic, postural instability, movement disorders, etc.) increases. Despite the fact that the disease is incurable, medications can significantly alleviate the symptoms of the disease.",

Die Punktprävalenz der leichten kognitiven Störungen bei Parkinsonpatienten (Mild Cognitive Impairment in Parkinson′s Disease, PD-MCI), für die 2012 Forschungskriterien publiziert wurden, wird im Mittel auf 27 % geschätzt werden; die Punktprävalenz der Parkinson-Demenz (Parkinson′s Disease Dementia, PDD) wird mit etwa 30 % angegeben. Longitudinal entwickeln die meisten Parkinsonpatienten während ihrer Erkrankung eine kognitive Störung. Aufgrund ihrer Häufigkeit und Relevanz ist es wichtig, diese zu diagnostizieren. Für die Therapie der PDD ist der Acetylcholinesterasehemmer Rivastigmin zugelassen; andere zugelassene Behandlungsmöglichkeiten existieren derzeit nicht. Die Evidenzlage zu nicht-pharmakologischen Interventionsansätzen ist bislang unzureichend; erste Studien zur Wirksamkeit kognitiven Trainings sowie physischer Aktivität sind jedoch vielversprechend.",

Hacer una revision actualizada de algunos de estos sintomas no motores en cuanto a la fisiopatologia, epidemiologia, clinica y terapeutica. Desarrollo. Trastornos autonomicos como la dermatitis seborreica y los trastornos de la sudoracion, la fatiga, la perdida de peso o las alteraciones respiratorias (disnea, estridor inspiratorio) son sintomas muy prevalentes e incapacitantes, pueden ser el problema principal en alguna fase de la EP (fatiga, estridor) y condicionan la calidad de vida de los pacientes parkinsonianos. Es habitual no pensar en ellos y que no sean detectados por el medico. Aunque pueden responder a farmacos dopaminergicos, suelen precisar un enfoque terapeutico diferente. Son necesarios estudios que valoren nuevas perspectivas terapeuticas que actuen contra los mecanismos fisiopatologicos de estas alteraciones. Conclusiones. La EP afecta a otros sistemas distintos al dopaminergico nigroestriatal. Su mejor conocimiento permitira abordar y optimizar el tratamiento de los sintomas que condicionan, reforzando el bienestar de los pacientes con EP.",

      "abstract": "Patients suffering from Parkinson's disease (PD) will typically experience a range of motor and nonmotor symptoms during the course of their illness, each of which will affect a particular individual to varying degrees. However, patients' perceptions of troublesome symptoms often differ from the clinician's view, and these discrepancies can hamper effective management of PD. In this study, we have assessed 265 consecutive PD patients by asking them to rank their three most troublesome symptoms in the last 6 months, so to gain further insight from the impact of illness on patients' quality of life. Patients were divided into early (<6 years) and late PD groups (>/=6 years) from symptom onset. The division at 6 years was based on the mean time from symptom onset to the development of motor complications. In the early PD group, the 5 most prevalent complaints (ranked in descending order) are slowness, tremor, stiffness, pain, and loss of smell and/or taste. In the advanced PD group, fluctuating response to their medication (most common: wearing-off phenomenon followed by dyskinesia), mood changes, drooling, sleep problems (most common: middle and late night insomnia followed by daytime sleepiness), and tremor were the top 5. Our findings provide further evidence for the diversity of experience in PD and suggest that as the disease advances the most troublesome issues that patients perceive are the lack of response to medication and the nonmotor aspects of the disease, highlighting the importance of assessment and patient-centered management in the follow-up of these patients.",

      "title": "Approche psycho-physiologique des troubles attentionnels dans la maladie de Parkinson",
      "abstract": "La Maladie de Parkinson (MP) est une maladie neuro-degenerative frequente, caracterisee par une depletion dopaminergique striatale. Elle s'accompagne precocement de troubles cognitifs, notamment attentionnels, dont l’origine reste imprecise. Deux hypotheses sont evoquees : un deficit du controle volontaire de l'attention vers la tâche en cours (processus de type « top-down » (TD)) ou un defaut d’inhibition des informations non pertinentes pour la tâche (par defaillance de processus de type « bottom-up » (BU)). Les processus attentionnels, souvent explores par la mesure de variables comportementales, peuvent egalement beneficier de l'enregistrement des composantes N200 et P300 des potentiels evoques cognitifs (PEC). La P300 comprend deux sous-composantes : (1) la P3a, survenant preferentiellement apres un distracteur, refletant un traitement BU ; (2) la P3b, associee a la detection de cibles et refletant un traitement TD. La N200 se decompose en une « no-go-N2 » anterieure, impliquee dans la detection de la deviance et les mecanismes d’inhibition et une « go-N2 » posterieure, engagee dans les processus de categorisation des cibles. Dans la MP, ces composantes ont le plus souvent une latence allongee et une amplitude reduite. La modification des generateurs des PEC dans la MP n’a, a notre connaissance, jamais ete exploree. L’objectif de cette these est de preciser les mecanismes sous-jacents aux troubles attentionnels dans la MP. En cas de dysfonctionnement TD, les reseaux impliques dans la genese de la P3b et/ou de la N200 posterieure pourraient etre alteres. Si une dysfonction BU en est a l’origine, les generateurs de la P3a et/ou de la N200 anterieure devraient etre modifies. Nous avons enregistre en haute resolution les PEC de 15 sujets sains jeunes, au cours d’un paradigme « oddball » visuel a trois stimulus afin d’etudier les generateurs des PEC chez le sujet sain. Le meme enregistrement a ensuite ete effectue chez 15 sujets atteints d’une MP compares a 15 sujets apparies. Les latences et amplitudes des composantes des PEC ont ete comparees au moyen d’analyses de variance. L’exploration des generateurs des PEC a ete effectuee pour chaque sujet et dans chaque condition au moyen d’une methode distribuee d’analyse de source, swLORETA (standardized weighted low resolution tomography). Les analyses statistiques de groupes des generateurs de la P300 ont ete effectuees au moyen du logiciel SPM, celles de la N200 au moyen de methodes de permutations. Chez les sujets jeunes, le reseau fronto-parietal dorsal (FPD) apparait implique dans la genese des deux composantes de la P300, le reseau fronto-parietal ventral etant specifique du traitement de la cible. L’etude des generateurs de la N200 a mis en evidence le role preponderant du cortex cingulaire anterieur (CCA) en interaction avec les reseaux fronto-parietaux, le precuneus et le cortex cingulaire posterieur. Dans la MP, il existait une reduction des sources de la P300 generee par le distracteur au niveau du cortex dorsolateral prefrontal (DLPF) appartenant au reseau FPD, en lien avec une augmentation des fausses alarmes aux distracteurs chez les patients, en faveur d'une defaillance des processus BU dans la MP. Une diminution des sources de la N200 a egalement ete constatee au niveau du cortex DLPF et du CCA, dans toutes les conditions. Ceci suggere un dysfonctionnement de ces deux regions des le stade precoce des processus attentionnels, seul le fonctionnement du cortex DLPF restant altere specifiquement dans le traitement des distracteurs lors des etapes ulterieures de traitement de l’information. Ces anomalies resultent probablement du dereglement des boucles baso-corticales reliant le striatum associatif au cortex DLPF et CCA. Ceci entrainerait une alteration du controle cognitif et des processus BU responsable d’anomalies de detection de la deviance et d'inhibition des stimulus non pertinents, sous-jacentes aux troubles de l’attention selective dans la MP.",

      "title": "Hypothesis of Ascension in Idiopathic Parkinson’s Disease",
      "abstract": "Abstract Different clinical stages are observed in idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (PD). Non-motor symptoms define in particular the prodromal period of PD whereas primary motor symptoms such as bradykinesia with rigidity, resting tremor or postural instability are mandatory for the diagnosis of PD. Important non-motor symptoms are olfactory dysfunction, constipation, depression and sleep disturbances. Corresponding to the clinical course of PD, the Braak staging system postulates that the neuropathological process of PD starts in the enteric nervous system (ENS) of the gut and in the olfactory bulb. From there, Parkinson pathology spreads by transsynaptic cell-to-cell transfer via the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system in a rostrocranial direction. If the central nervous system is reached, typical neuropathological changes of PD with selective degeneration of dopaminergic neurons of the Substantia nigra pars compacta, the formation of Lewy bodies, reactive gliosis and progressive central neurodegeneration appear. Evidence of clinical, pathological and animal studies supporting these hypotheses are summarised in this review article. α-synuclein as PD-specific pathology was found in the olfactory bulb, the ENS, the submandibular gland, the intermediolateral nucleus of the spinal cord and the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve. In an animal model, in which mice are treated with the pesticide rotenone chronically and intragastrically, we could almost completely reproduce the typical pathological and clinical features of PD as well as their development in a chronological and regional sequence.",

      "abstract": "Postural instability (PI) is one of the most debilitating motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease (PD), as it is associated with an increased risk of falls and subsequent medical complications (e.g. fractures), fear of falling, decreased mobility, self-restricted physical activity, social isolation, and decreased quality of life. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying PI in PD remain elusive. This short review provides a critical summary of the literature on PI in PD, covering the clinical features, the neural and cognitive substrates, and the effects of dopaminergic medications and deep brain stimulation. The delayed effect of dopaminergic medication combined with the success of extrastriatal deep brain stimulation suggests that PI involves neurotransmitter systems other than dopamine and brain regions extending beyond the basal ganglia, further challenging the traditional view of PD as a predominantly single-system neurodegenerative disease.",

      "abstract": "Although the basal ganglia have traditionally been considered as primarily involved in the regulation of motor functioning, their role in the integration of emotions with cognitive and motor behavior is increasingly recognized. Psychiatric symptoms, including disturbance of affect (anxiety and depression), perception (hallucinations), thought (delusions), as well as behavioral and personality changes (apathy and disinhibition) are commonly observed in most basal ganglia diseases. They produce increased suffering and distress both for the patients themselves as well as for the caregivers, and are associated with increased need for care. Thus, psychiatric symptoms should not be viewed as a secondary or additional feature of the movement disorders, but rather, representing important and inherent aspects of these disorders. Although this is true for Parkinson's disease (PD), it is even more so for several of the atypical parkinsonian disorders, where psychiatric symptoms may represent key features of the clinical syndrome. For instance, in dementia with Lewy bodies, visual hallucinations are among the three cardinal features (1), and in focal lesions of the caudate, neuropsychiatric symptoms occur more commonly than motor disorders (2). Knowledge of the wide variety of psychiatric symptoms and having the diagnostic skills to identify and optimize treatment of these symptoms are thus of major importance in the management of patients with movement disorders. In addition to providing important diagnostic information, they help elucidate the relationship between key brain circuits and psychiatric symptoms.",

A diminuição desse neurotransmissor no corpo estriado pode se manifestar com comprometimentos motores primários como tremor, bradicinesia, instabilidade postural e rigidez. Embora a doença não tenha cura, há tratamentos que podem auxiliar na prevenção e diminuição da velocidade de progressão da doença, como no caso da prática de atividade física. O objetivo deste estudo é analisar o impacto que a atividade física apresenta para a prevenção e tratamento da Doença de Parkinson. Trata-se de uma revisão narrativa dos últimos 5 anos, do período de 2019 a 2024, utilizando a base de dados: Medline e Literatura Latino-Americana e do Caribe em Ciências da Saúde(LILACS). Os descritores utilizados foram \"atividade física\" \"doença de parkinson\" \"prevenção\". Notou-se que a prática de atividades físicas de intensidade moderada a intensa está relacionado a diminuição da incidência da Doença de Parkinson. Além disso, evidenciou-se uma redução da velocidade de progressão da doença com essa prática através da diminuição do acúmulo de proteína α-syn, da perda neuronal dopaminérgica, dos mecanismos pró-inflamatórios e do aumento dos fatores neurotróficos. Nessa perspectiva, a prática de atividade física mostrou-se um importante fator protetor não só para prevenção, como também para o tratamento da Doença de Parkinson.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease associated with severe disability and adverse effects on life quality. In PD, motor dysfunction can occur, such as quiescence, muscle stiffness, and postural instability. PD is also associated with autonomic nervous dysfunction, sleep disorders, psychiatric symptoms, and other non-motor symptoms. Degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra compact (SNPC), Lewy body, and neuroinflammation are the main pathological features of PD. The death or dysfunction of dopaminergic neurons in the dense part of the substantia nigra leads to dopamine deficiency in the basal ganglia and motor dysfunction. The formation of the Lewy body is associated with the misfolding of α-synuclein, which becomes insoluble and abnormally aggregated. Astrocytes and microglia mainly cause neuroinflammation, and the activation of a variety of pro-inflammatory transcription factors and regulatory proteins leads to the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons. At present, PD is mainly treated with drugs that increase dopamine concentration or directly stimulate dopamine receptors. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) is a family of cellular signaling proteins strongly associated with neurodegenerative diseases such as PD. FGF and its receptor (FGFR) play an essential role in the development and maintenance of the nervous system as well as in neuroinflammation and have been shown to improve the survival rate of dopaminergic neurons. This paper summarized the mechanism of FGF and its receptors in the pathological process of PD and related signaling pathways, involving the development and protection of dopaminergic neurons in SNPC, α-synuclein aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and neuroinflammation. It provides a reference for developing drugs to slow down or prevent the potential of PD.",

A few symptoms of Parkinson's disease are stated here, namely, tremor, slowed movements, impaired posture, loss of automatic movements, change in speech and changes in handwriting. Symptoms of the diseases may vary from one patient to another. Out of the many symptoms, the change in speech is a vital sign for detecting Parkinson's as identified in the patient history. Given these symptoms can be recognized in the patient by investigating his voice data, and where deep learning is more powerful in investigating unstructured data which includes speech and audio signals, therefore, DL is familiar in its use for picking up these signals of the disease. Deep learning algorithm for unstructured data is constructed by multi-layer neurons which are stacked together for classification and feature selection. In order to predict the Parkinson's disease based on patient voice data, the proposed Parkinson's disease prediction system uses Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) algorithm with low resource and large scale speech task. For predicting the disease severity, Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM) algorithm makes use of UCI dataset.",

En 1955, Bedford estudio a 120 pacientes ancianos que desarrollaron demencia en el periodo postoperatorio; aunque este problema ha sido reconocido desde el siglo XVI aparecieron los primeros reportes en 1819. Cuenta con diversos sinonimos tales como: estado desconcertante agudo, sindrome de cerebro agudo, disfuncion mental, etc. La demencia es un sindrome definido por un deterioro cognitivo global con repercusion funcional, sin afectacion de la conciencia. Se caracteriza por un inicio gradual y curso progresivo. Puede ser dificil distinguir entre demencia y delirium debido a que muchas veces coexisten. Hasta un 50% de las demencias tienen un delirium asociado al ingreso y entre 25-50% de los pacientes con delirium tienen una demencia de base. Los principales rasgos para diferenciar ambos trastornos son: Inicio y curso: en el delirium los sintomas comienzan rapida y bruscamente, desarrollandose en horas o dias, mientras que en la demencia el curso es lentamente progresivo, de meses. Estado de la conciencia: en la demencia el individuo se mantiene alerta con poca o ninguna alteracion de la conciencia al contrario del delirium. En la actualidad, el delirio postoperatorio es una entidad bien definida (Cuadro I). La incidencia en ancianos va de 10% a 60%; en estudios recientes han incluido a las poblaciones quirurgicas oftalmicas, ortopedicas, y cardiacas.

Se han realizado multiples esfuerzos para encontrar nuevas pruebas para un diagnostico temprano del delirio postoperatorio.

On average, the screaming began 4.8 years after the onset signs and symptoms of Parkinson disease. In many cases, sleep talking started before the onset of Parkinson disease. All patients reported that the screaming disrupted the sleep of their families, and half of the patients reported that the screams disturbed their own sleep. The screams were incorporated into their dreams. Clonazepam was effective to alleviate this screaming in 8 out of 9 cases. We considered this screaming to be caused by similar mechanisms as rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder in which muscle atonia characterizing normal REM sleep is absent. The screams were not accompanied by other abnormal behaviors. We postulate that the screaming is a symptom closely related to that of mid or lower brainstem lesion in Parkinson disease because the neural activity of the locus ceruleus or the pudunculopontine nucleus are responsible for muscle atonia in REM sleep.",

      "title": "Cardiac Changes in Parkinson’s Disease: Lessons from Clinical and Experimental Evidence",
      "abstract": "Dysautonomia is a common non-motor symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD). Most dysautonomic symptoms appear due to alterations in the peripheral nerves of the autonomic nervous system, including both the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. The degeneration of sympathetic nerve fibers and neurons leads to cardiovascular dysfunction, which is highly prevalent in PD patients. Cardiac alterations such as orthostatic hypotension, heart rate variability, modifications in cardiogram parameters and baroreflex dysfunction can appear in both the early and late stages of PD, worsening as the disease progresses. In PD patients it is generally found that parasympathetic activity is decreased, while sympathetic activity is increased. This situation gives rise to an imbalance of both tonicities which might, in turn, promote a higher risk of cardiac damage through tachycardia and vasoconstriction. Cardiovascular abnormalities can also appear as a side effect of PD treatment: L-DOPA can decrease blood pressure and aggravate orthostatic hypotension as a result of a negative inotropic effect on the heart. This unwanted side effect limits the therapeutic use of L-DOPA in geriatric patients with PD and can contribute to the number of hospital admissions. Therefore, it is essential to define the cardiac features related to PD for the monitorization of the heart condition in parkinsonian individuals. This information can allow the application of intervention strategies to improve the course of the disease and the proposition of new alternatives for its treatment to eliminate or reverse the motor and non-motor symptoms, especially in geriatric patients.",

Insight into possible changes in pain experience as have been observed in the few available clinical studies, could be enhanced by knowledge about the neuropathology which may differ per subtype of dementia. It is striking that pain has not been examined in degenerative diseases of the central nervous system with a high risk for cognitive impairment such as Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis. In these disorders, pain is a prominent clinical symptom and to date it is not known whether the experience of pain will change in a stage in which patients become cognitively impaired.

The correct diagnosis was established by the electroencephalographic study, in one case after the patient experienced a generalized tonic-clonic seizure and in the other, after failure to improve with supposedly adequate treatment. There are reports of patients with NCSE whose symptoms suggest a psychiatric disorder (inappropriate behavior, emotional disinhibition, perseveration, reduced speech and motivation). This can occur without altered consciousness and symptoms may fluctuate, making the correct diagnosis extremely difficult. This entity can occur at any age and without a previous history of seizures.

      "title": "Endogene Schmerzmodulation bei Morbus Parkinson",
      "abstract": "1. Zusammenfassung\r\n1.1\t Hintergrund und Ziele\r\nDas idiopathische Parkinson-Syndrom (IPS) ist vornehmlich gekennzeichnet durch seine motorischen Kardinalsymptome Bradykinese, Rigor, Tremor und posturale Instabilitat. Jedoch finden sich ebenso haufig und vor allem auch bereits in fruhen Krankheitsstadien nicht-motorische Symptome wie zum Beispiel chronische Schmerzen. Mittels zahlreicher histopathologischer Untersuchungen konnte die Ausbreitung der IPS-typischen Lasionen, sogenannter Lewy-Einschlusskorperchen, im ZNS im Verlauf der Parkinson-Erkrankung eindeutig dargestellt werden. Dabei zeigte sich bereits in sehr fruhen IPS-Stadien der Verlust von Neuronen in Strukturen des schmerzverarbeitenden und –modulierenden Systems. Dies wiederum wirft die Frage nach IPS-assoziierten Defiziten im Bereich der Schmerzwahrnehmung und -verarbeitung auf, deren Erorterung auch das Ziel der hier vorliegenden Arbeit darstellt.\r\n\r\n1.2\t Methoden\r\nIn der hier durchgefuhrten Studie wurde bei 21 Parkinsonpatienten im Vergleich mit ebenso vielen, gleichaltrigen, gesunden Kontrollpersonen die Aktivitat von endogenen schmerzmodulierenden Systemen getestet. Zu diesem Zweck wurde der volare Unterarm der Studienteilnehmer mittels transdermaler elektrischer Stimulation uber einen Zeitraum von 50 Minuten repetitiv noxisch gereizt, um somit gleichzeitig die inhibierenden und fazilitierenden Komponenten des Schmerzmodulationssystems aktivieren zu konnen. Dabei wurde zum einen die Fahigkeit zur Schmerzhabituation uber die Dauer der Stimulation (als Surrogatmarker der Schmerzinhibition) bestimmt, zum anderen die nach der elektrischen Reizung entstandene Hyperalgesiezone (als Korrelat der pronozizeptiven Aktivitat) vermessen. Zusatzlich wurde jeweils vor und nach der elektrischen Reizung die taktile Detektionsschwelle (MDT) und mechanische Schmerzschwelle (MPT) bei allen Studienteilnehmern ermittelt.\r\n\r\n1.3\t Ergebnisse und Beobachtungen\r\nDie psychophysikalische Testung ergab keinen signifikanten Unterschied zwischen MDT und MPT bei IPS-Patienten und Kontrollpersonen sowohl vor als auch nach der elektrischen Stimulation; beide Gruppen zeigten ubereinstimmend nach der repetitiven noxischen Reizung eine signifikant reduzierte MPT im Sinne einer entstandenen Hyperalgesie.\r\nAllerdings fand sich bei den IPS-Patienten eine signifikant verminderte Habituation an den schmerzhaften Stimulus nach 16-minutiger Reizung im Vergleich zu den gesunden Kontrollprobanden, was fur ein defizitares endogenes Schmerzhemmsystem bei Morbus Parkinson spricht. Beide Studiengruppen entwickelten zudem eine sekundare Hyperalgesie- und Flarezone um den Ort der elektrischen Stimulation, deren jeweilige Ausdehnung sich jedoch zwischen Patienten und Probanden nicht signifikant voneinander unterschied.\r\n\r\n1.4\t Praktische Schlussfolgerungen\r\nDie in der vorliegenden Arbeit gewonnenen Daten deuten dabei auf ein defizitares Schmerzhemmsystem bei Morbus Parkinson hin. Auch im Hinblick auf die neuropathologische Ausbreitung der IPS-typischen Lewy-Korperchen, die bereits in sehr fruhen Stadien der Erkrankung schmerzmodulierende Strukturen betreffen, konnte sich die reduzierte Fahigkeit zur Schmerzinhibition theoretisch ebenfalls bereits zu einem sehr fruhen Zeitpunkt der Erkrankung zu manifestieren; moglicherweise sogar noch vor dem Auftreten motorischer Symptome. Zugleich bedeuten die durch das IPS veranderten Ablaufe der Schmerzmodulation auch einen zusatzlichen Risikofaktor fur die Entwicklung chronischer Schmerzen, die bekanntermasen ebenfalls ein haufiges Symptom bei Morbus Parkinson darstellen. Die Bedeutung der dopaminergen Medikation zwischen IPS und Schmerzwahrnehmung/-modulation sollte dabei noch genauer untersucht werden. Insgesamt konnte ein besseres Verstandnis der zugrundeliegenden Mechanismen die notige Voraussetzung fur neue Moglichkeiten zur IPS-Fruherkennung oder auch Therapieansatze bei IPS-assoziierten Schmerzen schaffen.",

      "abstract": "Peripheral neuropathy, a common neurologic problem encountered by family physicians, can be classified clinically by the anatomic pattern of presenting symptoms and, if indicated, by results of electrodiagnostic studies for axonal and demyelinating disease. The prevalence of peripheral neuropathy in the general population ranges from 1% to 7%, with higher rates among those older than 50 years. Common identifiable causes include diabetes mellitus, nerve compression or injury, alcohol use, toxin exposure, hereditary diseases, and nutritional deficiencies. Peripheral neuropathy is idiopathic in 25% to 46% of cases. Diagnosis requires a comprehensive history, physical examination, and judicious laboratory testing. Early peripheral neuropathy may present as sensory alterations that are often progressive, including sensory loss, numbness, pain, or burning sensations in a stocking and glove distribution of the extremities. Later stages may involve proximal numbness, distal weakness, or atrophy. Physical examination should include a comprehensive neurologic and musculoskeletal evaluation. If the peripheral nervous system is identified as the likely source of the patient's symptoms, evaluation for potential underlying etiologies should initially focus on treatable causes. Initial laboratory evaluation includes a complete blood count; a comprehensive metabolic profile; fasting blood glucose, vitamin B12, and thyroid-stimulating hormone levels; and serum protein electrophoresis with immunofixation. If the initial evaluation is inconclusive, referral to a neurologist for additional testing (e.g., electrodiagnostic studies, specific antibody assays, nerve biopsy) should be considered. Treatment of peripheral neuropathy focuses on managing the underlying etiology. Several classes of medications, including gabapentinoids and antidepressants, can help alleviate neuropathic pain.",

Sources of excessive daytime sleepiness in PD and DLB often include sleep fragmentation, side effects of medications, and sleep disorders that disrupt night-time sleep continuity. The parasomnia of REM sleep behavior disorder has also been shown to be an early feature of PD and DLB and a risk factor for dementia in PD. Dysfunction of the dopamine nigrostriatal and mesolimbic systems is involved in Lewy body disease, but several other neurotransmitter systems have Lewy body pathology and neuronal loss that may be responsible for abnormal sleepiness and REM sleep behavior disorder in these conditions.",

      "abstract": "To be classified as cerebral palsy (CP), there must be difficulty in neuromotor control, a nonprogressive brain lesion, and an injury to the brain that occurred before it was fully mature. The term \"cerebral palsy\" should be used only if a static encephalopathy exists. If there is any question that a progressive central nervous system disorder exists, the term \"cerebral palsy\" should not be used diagnostically until the status of the lesion is clarified. Although the primary abnormality must be a motor deficit, often there are many associated symptoms of cerebral dysfunction present. Incidence and Prevalence The prevalence of CP has changed very little over the past 40 years, in spite of many technological advances that have decreased mortality in compromised preterm and full-term infants. The prevalence rate has been estimated to be between 2 and 5 per 1000 live births. At 12 months of age, the prevalence rate was estimated to be 5.2 per 1000, but at 7 years of age, the rate was estimated to be 2 per 1000 live births. This indicates that many children who showed signs or experienced symptoms suggesting a motor disorder did not have CP on follow-up. The past 3 decades have seen an increased survival rate of very small preterm infants, resulting in a change in the percentage rates of the different clinical types of motor disabilities among patients classified as having CP.",

In cross-sectional samples of PD patients attending a neurology unit the prevalence of depression is about 40%, but prevalences may be lower in epidemiological samples. Both psychological and autonomic symptoms of depression are specific to the depressive syndrome of PD, except for the symptoms of anergia, motor retardation, and early morning awakening. Depression may start before the onset of motor symptoms, and most patients with PD may eventually develop depression at some point during their longitudinal evolution. Follow-up studies suggest that PD patients with major depression have a significantly faster decline in activities of daily living and cognitive functions, and a faster progression along the stages of the illness as compared to non-depressed PD patients.

      "abstract": "Parkinsonova bolest je idiopatski, sporo progredirajuci poremecaj sredisnjeg živcanog sustava koji obilježava sporost i siromastvo pokreta, rigor misica, tremor u mirovanju i nestabilnost u održavanju položaja tijela. Bolest zahvaca oko 1% pucanstva starijeg od 65 godina. Temelj bolesti je propadanje dopaminergicnih neurona u pars compacta supstancije nigre i posljedicna hipoaktivnost dopaminergicnog sustava. U lijecenju Parkinsonove bolesti primjenjuju se: levodopa s inhibitorima periferne dopa dekarboksilaze, dopaminergicki agonisti, katehol-o-metiltransferaza (COMT) inhibitori, selegilin - inhibitor monoaminooksidaze tipa B (MAO-B inhibitor), amantadin, antikolinergicki lijekovi i neurokirurski postupci (neurokirurski postupci nisu tema ovog prikaza). Levodopa, metabolicki prekursor dopamina koji prolazi hematoencefalnu barijeru, najucinkovitiji je lijek za Parkinsonovu bolest i l zlatni standardr terapije. Može imati i dijagnosticki znacaj: ako bolesnik ne reagira barem u pocetku bolesti na levodopu, tada vrlo vjerovatno ne boluje od Parkinsonove bolesti. Međutim, dugotrajnom primjenom levodope pojavljuju se komplikacije: diskinezije i fluktuacije u motorickom odgovoru, a postoje i indicije da primjena levodope može pojacati oksidativni stres koji bi mogao dovoditi do progresije propadanja dopaminergicnih neurona. Stoga preparate levodope treba primjenjivati low&slow. U Hrvatskoj su dostupni preparati levodope s karbidopom i levodope s benzerazidom, u klasicnom obliku i u pripravcima s postpunim (kontroliranim) otpustanjem. Dopaminergicki (DA) agonisti se u zadnje vrijeme sve vise propisuju, kako u pocetnim, tako i u uznapredovalim fazama bolesti jer se pokazalo da bi mogli odgoditi pocetak primjene levodope, odgoditi i ublažiti diskineziju i motoricke fluktuacije koje su posljedica primjene levodope, a postoje indicije i o neuroprotektivnom ucinku DA agonista. U Hrvatskoj je dostupan ergotski DA agonist bromokriptin, te selektivniji, ne-ergotski DA agonisti pramipeksol i ropinirol. DA agoniste je u pocetku terapije potrebno postupno titrirati. U Hrvatskoj je od nedavno dostupan periferni inhibitori COMT entakapon koji sprecava razgradnju levodope i na taj nacin povecava poluvrijeme eliminacije levodope cime dovodi do ublažavanja motorickih fluktuacija povezanih s dugotrajnom primjenom levodope. Selegilin, MAO-B inhibitor, blokira enzimatski put razgradnje dopamina, a postoje indicije i o njegovom neuroprotektivnom djelovanju. Može se primjenjivati kao monoterapija u pocetku bolesti, ili kao dodatak terapiji levodopom. Amantadin je lijek koji nije dostupan u Hrvatskoj, a najcesce se propisuje u pocetnim fazama bolesti. Jos uvijek nije sasvim objasnjen mehanizam njegovog djelovanja. Antikolinergici su djelotvorni prvenstveno u smirivanju tremora bolesnika, no s obzirom na mnoge nuspojave, sve rjeđe se primjenjuju u terapiji. U Hrvatskoj je na raspolaganju biperidin. U terapiji Parkinsonove bolesti nužno je potreban individualni pristup, za svakog bolesnika ponaosob treba odrediti monoterapiju ili kombinaciju lijekova koji tom bolesniku u određenoj fazi bolesti najbolje djeluju. U pocetnoj fazi bolesti terapija se obicno pocinje dopaminergickim agonistom, selegilinom ili amantadinom, a s napredovanjem simptoma bolesti u zapocinje se i terapija levodopom najcesce u kombinaciji s navedenim lijekovima.",

      "title": "Dopaminergic and non‐dopaminergic pharmacological hypotheses for gait disorders in Parkinson’s disease",
      "abstract": "Abstract Gait disorders form one component of the axial disorders observed in Parkinson’s disease (PD). Indeed, short steps with a forward‐leaning stance are diagnostic criteria for PD in the early stages of the condition. Gait disorders also represent a major source of therapeutic failure in the advanced stages of PD (with the appearance of freezing of gait and falls) because they do not respond optimally to the two hand late‐stage therapeutics – levodopa and electrical subthalamic nucleus (STN) stimulation. The late onset of doparesistance in these disorders may be linked to propagation of neurodegeneration to structures directly involved in gait control and to non‐dopaminergic neurotransmitter systems. The coeruleus locus (a source of noradrenaline) is rapidly and severely affected, leading to a major motor impact. The pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN) and lateral pontine tegmentum (rich in acetylcholine) are both involved in gait. Degenerative damage to the serotoninergic raphe nuclei appears to be less severe, although serotonin‐dopamine interactions are numerous and complex. Lastly, dopaminergic depletion leads to glutamatergic hyperactivity of the efferent pathways from the the STN to the PPN. However, the relationships between the various parkinsonian symptoms (and particularly gait disorders) and these pharmacological targets have yet to be fully elucidated. The goal of this review is to develop the various pathophysiological hypotheses published to date, in order to underpin and justify ongoing fundamental research and clinical trials in this disease area.",

      "abstract": "A suitable therapy for combating Parkinson’s disease (PD) neurodegeneration has not been forthcoming and although treatments are available to slow progression, there is no cure and no medical repair procedures. Of great interest to neurologists and neurology researchers have been the new findings with neurotrophic factors such as glial-cell derived neurotrophic factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor, the neurotrophins being shown to have the ability to slow neurodegeneration and, in certain instances, rescue neurons. Unfortunately, outcomes of treatments using these proteins have been disappointing or inconclusive at best, and this includes direct infusion into areas of the brain. There is a consensus that once this disease starts there is little chance of halting its progress. One of the first indications that PD is a future possibility in a patient is a loss of olfaction. We have taken this as a starting point, maybe the earliest indication that neurotrophin treatment should be initiated with the possibility that if this isn’t a cure, it is a potent retardant of inevitable neuron loss and attenuating at least some of the many associated problems. Our work showed in cell cultures and an endotoxin animal model that synthesis of GDNF lagged behind inflammatory cell invasion, release of cytokines, protein folding problems and microglial activation. Our hypothesis is, that early interventions with neurotrophins might delay devastating neuronal loss and overcome some of the inflammatory effects, and that this treatment could begin at the time of loss of olfaction, together with prescribing anti-inflammatories. Couple this with blocking nitric oxide synthase increases and a reasonably early starting point for treatment might well be found. Journal of Nature and Science (JNSCI), 2(11):e249, 2016",

      "abstract": "We previously hypothesized that depressive and manic states may be consecutive presentations of the same underlying neuronal plasticity, and that moderate impairments in neuronal plasticity cause depressive states while further impairment to neuronal plasticity causes manic states. Psychopathological or biological relationships between bipolar disorder and schizophrenia have also been revealed. Therefore, in addition to depressive and manic states, psychosis may also be considered a manifestation resulting from additional impairments to neuronal plasticity. In the present manuscript, we hypothesize that moderate and more severe impairments to neuronal plasticity cause depressive and manic states, respectively, and that more serious impairments to neuronal plasticity cause psychosis. Many studies have suggested that impairments in neuronal plasticity contribute to schizophrenia and other mental disorders with psychotic features, and that the impairment of neuronal plasticity in schizophrenia is more severe than that in bipolar disorder. Therefore, we hypothesize more specifically that impairments in neuronal plasticity may be more severe in the order of the cases featuring psychosis, mania, and depression. This progression notably overlaps with the arrangement of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and depressive disorder in the DSM-5. Psychotic symptoms are thought to appear further towards the base of the psychopathological hierarchy than are manic or depressive symptoms. If impairments to neuronal plasticity contribute to this psychopathological hierarchy, as we contest that they do, our hypothesis may serve as a bridge between clinical psychopathology, diagnosis, and biological psychiatry.",

      "title": "Sleep Problems in Parkinson’s Disease",
      "abstract": "In his famous monograph “An Essay in Shaking Palsy,” James Parkinson provided astute descriptions of impaired sleep in his case series of patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) two centuries ago. It is only three decades ago that sleep dysfunction started to attract attention of medical and scientific communities involved in the clinical care and research of PD. Tremendous advancements in our understanding of impaired sleep and alertness associated with PD have developed since then.\r\n\r\nSleep problems are one of the major, challenging issues in patients with PD, affecting a significant number of patients. The etiology of sleep problems is multifactorial, including disease-related nocturnal symptoms, medication adverse effects, and primary sleep disorders including restless legs syndrome, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, and sleep apnea syndrome. These causes of impaired sleep-wake cycles in the PD population often coexist or even overlap, rendering the management of sleep problems in PD patients difficult. Also, excessive daytime sleepiness is observed in a significant number of patients. In PD patients, therefore, appropriate assessment of disease-related nocturnal disturbances and primary sleep disorders is imperative. This special issue addresses unmet need for understanding PD-related sleep problems.\r\n\r\nPD sleep scale 2 (PDSS-2) is a recently developed tool for screening and managing sleep disturbance in PD patients, consisting of 15 items which are clinically relevant to nocturnal problems including nonmotor and motor problems in PD [1]. The original PDSS-2 (German and English) has been translated into several languages, including Japanese [2] and Italian [3]. The PDSS-2 has been used to observe treatment response. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, including 287 PD patients, mean PDSS-2 total score decreased by −5.9 points with rotigotine and by −1.9 points with placebo [4]. In this special issue, K. Horvath et al. estimated the threshold representing minimal clinically important difference of the PDSS-2 total score: the study results showed −3.44 points for detecting improvement or the threshold of 2.07 points for observing worsening. This finding is important when planning studies using the PDSS-2 as outcome measures.\r\n\r\nFull-night polysomnography (PSG) is a gold standard for diagnosing sleep apnea syndrome; however, applying PSG is often difficult in patients with PD, who have severe parkinsonism or psychiatric comorbidity. P. Gros et al. evaluated the usefulness of unattended portable monitoring (PM) for diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in patients with PD. Although discrepancy between portable monitoring and PSG was greater in PD patients with more motor dysfunction, the authors confirmed the usefulness of portable monitoring in diagnosing moderate to severe OSA in PD patients. These results provide the rationale for the use of portable sleep monitoring in PD and are very relevant for circumstances where a complete PSG in a sleep laboratory is not available and/or feasible.\r\n\r\nM. Kaminska et al. performed a review on the relationship between OSA and PD. Although the clinical significance of OSA in PD has been controversial [5, 6], the authors suggest the possibility that treatment of OSA could delay cognitive decline or motor dysfunction in patients with PD. This area of research is of high significance as it is important to assess the prevalence of OSA and the impact of its treatment in the PD population.\r\n\r\nD. Martinez-Ramirez et al. correlated PSG findings and sleep disorders with clinical characteristics in PD patients and found that sleep disorders and sleep architecture were poorly predictable by clinical characteristic of PD patients. This comprehensive study demonstrates the complexity of sleep dysfunction associated with PD and its complex associations with metrics of PD.\r\n\r\nIn a fine and thoughtful study K. Suzuki et al. provided an interesting insight into the complex relationship between PD and restless legs syndrome (RLS) and leg motor restlessness (LMR). A significant relationship between RLS and PD is suggested by observing a favorable response to dopaminergic treatment in both disorders. However, RLS prevalence in PD patients varies according to different studies. Recently, LMR, characterized by an urge to move the legs that does not fulfill the diagnostic criteria for RLS, has been reported more frequently in patients untreated with PD than healthy controls. This review article may provide a new insight into the relationship between RLS, LMR, and PD.\r\n\r\nFinally, the complex and still only partially understood interaction of impulse control disorders in PD and sleep is discussed in a review from the clinic of one of the guest editors.\r\n\r\nIn summary, sleep problems are common but underreported by PD patients and underdiagnosed by health professionals. Further understanding of mechanisms that underlie impaired sleep and alertness in PD will allow for development of much needed treatment approaches for this nonmotor manifestation of PD.\r\n\r\n\r\nKoichi Hirata\r\n\r\nBirgit Hogl\r\n\r\nEng King Tan\r\n\r\nAleksandar Videnovic",

      "title": "Bipolar Disorders",
      "abstract": "Pediatric bipolar disorder (PBD) is a recurring complex psychopathological mood disorder causing significant impairment in children. PBD spectrum includes bipolar I (full manic episode), bipolar II (depression with hypomania) and bipolar not otherwise specified (NOS) (“others” in mid-spectrum who may be exhibiting prodromal PBD states but do not fit criteria clearly).The clinical presentation of PBD often does not meet the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders criteria for bipolar disorder (BD), which was developed in adults and not adapted for children. The diagnosis becomes difficult because symptom presentation is variable and largely dependent on developmental age. Although discrete episodes of mania and depression that define BD in adults may match the presentation of some patients who have BD in adolescence, patients who have BD of childhood and prepubertal onset may or may not manifest these clear-cut episodes. The duration of episodes in children may be as short as 1 to 2 days. Mood symptoms can be chronic, can present as predominantly mixed episodes, or can continuously cycle rapidly, with severe irritability or aggression as the usual presenting symptoms. Disruptive behavior, hyperarousal, racing thoughts, elation, and grandiosity also may characterize the moods. A major depressive presentation is associated with a significant risk for developing subsequent BD. Poor psychosocial skills as well as cognitive and attention deficits may manifest along with mood and behavior changes. The chronic relapsing mode of PBD may extend into early adulthood. Longitudinal studies abound on PBD; yet, there is no firm agreement on exactly what constitutes the diagnosis of PBD.Complicating the diagnosis of PBD is the high rate of comorbidity with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and psychiatric disorders such as anxiety, conduct, substance abuse, and oppositional defiant disorders. Children who have both PBD and ADHD tend to manifest a more severe course of illness, presenting with psychosis and comorbid depression often requiring hospitalization. Although both PBD and ADHD include symptoms of distractibility and hyperactivity, the distinguishing symptoms of mania, flight of ideas, decreased need for sleep, and exhibition of sexual tendencies are present in PBD but usually not in ADHD.PBD is thought to result from an interaction among genetic and environmental risk factors in which family environment is important. The genetic endowment of parents might contribute to the family dysfunction, predisposing already genetically affected offspring to evolution of the disorder. PBD is a highly heritable disorder having a documented genetic determinant, although its basis is not yet fully elucidated. Family history is the most significant risk factor for developing the illness. Studies show an increased risk of psychopathology in the offspring of parents who have BD. Early depression, anxieties, and dysregulated behavior may be useful markers for later development of BD in high-risk children. Those symptoms may be episodic. Some researchers suggest that PBD markers may be detectable almost a decade before the onset of the clinical disorder.Ongoing research is searching to identify PBD prodromes and early risk markers for the later developments of PBD. Clinical staging is proposed in identifying the PBD evolution among at-risk children. Early symptoms in the evolution include abnormalities in temperament, anxiety, sleep disruption, minor mood disturbance, difficulties with emotion regulation, and adjustment problems, progressing into mixed mood episodes, followed by frank bipolarity later in adolescence and adulthood. Heritable biomarkers in the areas of attention, executive function, and affect processing are subjects of ongoing research. There may be structural, functional, and biochemical alterations in the brain predisposing the child to mood instability.Research has suggested that physical, sexual, and emotional childhood traumas that occur at a time of sensitivity of the maturing central nervous system may predispose to and modulate the clinical expression and course of the PBD. Traumas cause organic changes in the brain that lead to mood dysregulation. These changes may result in a rapid cycling course, psychotic features, suicidal behavior, and an earlier age of onset, all of which induce a more severe clinical PBD profile. Traumas can result from any stressful event. Examples include behavioral, educational, family related, or substance abuse induced episodes; negative life events, such as low socioeconomic status, ongoing family conflicts, or low quality of life; or any disappointing life events such as school failure or termination of relationships.As many as two thirds of adults given a diagnosis of BP had symptoms beginning in childhood. This finding underscores the importance of risk and prodrome recognition, along with early and accurate diagnosis that allows intervention before full development of the highly impairing disorder. Expert agreements on what constitute key features and valid biomarkers for PBD diagnosis are needed.Comments: When reviewing community-based studies, the diagnosis of PBD has increased dramatically over the past decade. In retrospective studies in adults, 10% to 20% revealed the onset of symptoms when they were younger than 10 years of age, and 60% when younger than 20 years, with most self-reporting a delay of 10 years in making the diagnosis. Although unfortunate, this finding may not be surprising, because there are less clear diagnostic criteria for children and because pediatricians have not been trained to consider this diagnosis. Early diagnosis is important in order to initiate appropriate treatment and minimize morbidity and mortality, such as through suicide. As pediatricians, we need to consider the diagnosis in children who exhibit irritability and aggression, and a family history of bipolar disease is important to determine. Future research is needed to better examine treatment options in children and whether earlier treatment will result in better outcomes. The challenge of managing PBD is yet another example of the importance of mental health training for pediatricians and for collaboration with mental health providers to provide the best possible care to our patients.Janet Serwint, MDConsulting Editor, In Brief",

      "title": "The Interaction Between Psychologic Distress and Biobehavioral Processes in Cardiovascular Disease",
      "abstract": "This chapter reviews the role of psychologic distress in cardiovascular disease. Evidence is provided that the stage of the cardiovascular disease is an important determinant of the nature and biobehavioral pathways by which psychologic distress influences cardiovascular disease progression and its clinical manifestations, such as myocardial infarction and sudden cardiac death. Acute stressors are of primary importance as triggers of acute coronary syndromes in the presence of relatively advanced coronary artery disease, whereas episodes of sustained elevated distress are associated with increased vulnerability for acute coronary syndromes, and chronic distress related to traits and/or stable adverse socioenvironmental factors is associated with the gradual progression of coronary artery disease and other cardiovascular diseases. Multiple factors are involved in the onset and maintenance of psychologic distress, including environmental and personal vulnerability factors that increase the likelihood of developing acute or prolonged distress as well as factors that may buffer or attenuate the distress response. Many patients with elevated cardiovascular risk based on psychologic characteristics will not qualify for traditional psychiatric diagnostic classification criteria. The detection of debilitating psychologic distress could be useful in early identification of patients with cardiovascular disease who may benefit from psychologic interventions. Investigations of interventions targeted at reducing distress may reduce risk of adverse cardiovascular events in high-risk patients. Important knowledge will be gained about the pathophysiology of cardiovascular disease if integrative interventions will be developed with multiple assessments of biologic, physiologic, and behavioral measures.",

      "title": "PARKIN DISEASE–A CLINICOPATHOLOGICAL ENTITY?",
      "abstract": "<h3>Introduction</h3> Mutations in the gene encoding parkin (PARK2) are the commonest cause of autosomal recessive juvenile and young onset parkinsonism. The few available detailed neuropathological reports suggest that homozygous and compound heterozygous parkin mutations are characterised by severe substantia nigra pars compacta neuronal loss. In this study we investigate whether parkin–linked parkinsonism is a different clinicopathological entity to Parkinson9s disease (PD). <h3>Material and methods</h3> We describe the clinical, genetic and neuropathological findings in five unrelated cases of parkin disease and compare them with pathologically confirmed PD and controls. <h3>Results</h3> Presenting signs in the parkin disease cases were hand or leg tremor often combined with dystonia. Mean age of onset was 34 years; all were compound heterozygous for mutations of parkin. Freezing of gait, postural deformity and motor fluctuations were common late features. No patients had any evidence of cognitive impairment or dementia. Neuronal counts in the substantia nigra pars compacta revealed that neuronal loss in the parkin cases was as severe as that seen in PD, but relative preservation of the dorsal tier was seen in comparison with PD (p=0.04). Mild neuronal loss was identified in the locus coeruleus and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, but not in the nucleus basalis of Meynert, raphe nucleus or other brain regions. Sparse Lewy bodies (LBs) were identified in 2 cases (brainstem and cortex). <h3>Conclusions</h3> These findings support the notion that parkin disease is characterised by a more restricted morphological abnormality than is found in PD, with predominantly ventral nigral degeneration and absent or rare Lewy bodies.",

This is partly because the nervous system is a communications system with direct access to consciousness, so that the patient is in a unique position to monitor his own disorder.

Another reason is that useful biochemical and histological information about the function of neurons is rarely available, in contrast to the wealth of data used in the assessment of diseases of other organs, such as the lungs, liver or kidneys. The failure of neurons in the CNS to regenerate means that delay in making a precise diagnosis can worsen the eventual outcome; the clinician often cannot afford to watch how an illness progresses before intervening.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease and closely related Parkinsonian neurodegenerative diseases are frequently associated with neurogenic orthostatic hypotension. In many cases, the dysautonomia would be attributed to Parkinson's disease or its closely related neurodegenerative mimics. We present our experience diagnosing and managing a patient with dysautonomia attributed to an initial diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and systemic amyloidosis, which the coexistence of these two diseases have not been previously reported in the literature. Our 73-year-old patient developed levodopa-responsive symptoms initially suggestive of Parkinson's disease. Within three years, he developed progressively worsening neurogenic orthostatic hypotension and, eventually, symptomatic bradycardia requiring a pacemaker, and was found to have a condition causing the dysautonomia other than Parkinson's. Further workup led to a concurrent diagnosis of amyloid light-chain amyloidosis, which was successfully treated with chemotherapy. Despite being in remission of the amyloidosis and having satisfactory control of the Parkinson's motor symptoms, his neurogenic orthostatic hypotension continued to be severely disabling, and overall functioning continued to decline. Although neurogenic orthostatic hypotension is common in Parkinson's disease and closely related neurogenerative disorders, there may be clinical features discordant with a neurodegenerative disorder that could lead to an alternative explanation for the dysautonomia. This patient not only fell into the usual Parkinsonism with dysautonomia differential diagnosis but also suggests that Parkinsonian conditions and systemic amyloidosis may exert a synergistic effect on morbidity, explaining why management of dysautonomia in these patients and reducing disability may be a significant challenge.",

      "abstract": "Current opinion suggests there is a preclinical phase in idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (PD) with a latent period somewhere between 6 and 40 years. 1,2 This prodrome, sometimes also termed the presymptomatic or pre -motor phase of PD, needs to be distinguished from non -motor features such as neuropsychiatric symptoms, dysautonomia, fatigue, and so on,3 only some of which start before the classical motor triad of PD (tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia). Clearly, prediction of PD would be straight forward in those few parkinsonian patients with monogenetic disorder that in theory may be identified from birth, but most such mutations are very rare. A variety of predictive biochemical tests4 are proposed but as yet none is sufficiently reliable. Fluorodopa positron emission tomography (PET) or dopamine transporter imaging (DATScan) will detect deficiency of striatal dopamine but by this stage the motor phase–at least neurochemically–has probably begun. So might symptoms or signs foretell PD, and if so, which ones and how reliably? Such predictive research has many potential benefits as it enhances our understanding of the underlying disease mechanism, identifies subjects at risk of future PD, and provides an opportunity for neuroprotective therapy if this is eventually found to be effective.\n\nBraak pathological staging5 represents a landmark in our understanding of PD and may provide a basis for any proposed clinically based predictive features of the motor stage (see fig 1 and table). The first two stages represent the pathological substrate of preclinical PD while stage III straddles the premotor and motor phases. It is estimated that when some 50% of nigral cells are lost the first motor symptoms will appear,6 heralding the end of the premotor phase; hence tests of structures involved at this juncture such as the amygdala and pedunculopontine nucleus are unlikely to be rewarding …",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder whose main clinical features are rigidity, tremor, akinesia and postural instability. While Parkinson's disease primarily impairs the motor function, numerous studies have shown that it also affects cognition. Mental changes are often the inevitable follower of Parkinson's disease motor symptoms. The cognitive dysfunction of the subcorticofrontal type sometimes leading to dementia. Results of neuropsychological testing of 25 patients in I and II stages of the disease are shown. Tests for the frontal functions, visuomotor skills, visual organization and memory were administered. Results of this investigation showed that nondemented patients in early stages of the disease have low achievements on tests of frontal functions and memory. Patients exhibited the specific deficit in executive functioning, spatial behaviour, verbal and visual memory. Used neuropsychological tests have the diagnostic value in cognitive disfunction detection, in an early phase of Parkinson's disease. We may conclude that neuropsychological tests are important for identification of early cognitive disturbances in Parkinson's disease. By neuropsychological testing we can gat data on cerebral dysfunction that can be used for diagnostic, therapeutic, rehabilitational and research purposes.",

      "title": "[Vascular or \"lower body Parkinsonism\": rise and fall of a diagnosis].",
      "abstract": "The \"arteriosclerotic parkinsonism\", which is called vascular parkinsonism (VP), was first described by Critchley'. The broad based slow gait, reduced stride lenght, start hesitation, freezing and paratonia was mentioned as \"lower body parkinsonism\" (LBP) which can be associated by slow speech, dysexecutive syndrome, and hand tremor of predominantly postural character. In VP the DAT-scan proved normal dopamine content of the striatum in contrast with Parkinson's disease (PD). Additionally, Lewy bodies of brainstem type were not found in VR Probability of VP increases if central type pathologic gait is prominent; the hands are slightly involved, the MRI indicates transparent periventricular white substance and/or brain atrophy. In some cases differentiation of gait apraxia and parkinsonism could be challenging. There is no rigor of the lower limbs at rest in neither of them, the disturbance of movement is evoked by the gait itself. Three subtypes of \"gait ignition failure\" has been recently described: (1) ignition apraxia, (2) equilibrium apraxia and (3) mixed gait apraxia. The primary progressive freesing gait was considered as a Parkinson-plus syndrome. Freesing occurs more frequently in diseases with pakinsonism than in PD. The grade of ventricle dilatation and the frontal leukoaraiosis was similar in LBP and gait apraxia. In cases of normal pressure hydrocephalus the impaired gait may mimic PD. Pathologic gait in VP can be explained by the lesions of the senso-motor association pathways in dorsal paramedian white substance within the vulnerable borderzone region. These may be colocalized with the representation of the lower extremities in the posterior third of the supplementer motor area. Rektor2 proposed to change the name of LBP to \"cerebrovascular gait disorder\". Notwithstandig central type gait disorder develops also in many degenerative diseases other than cerebro-vascular origin. The neuronal net controling the regulation of movement is widespread, therefore several cortical and subcortical lesions could elicit large variations of pathologic gait, ie.: ataxia, apraxia, ignition failure, akinesis etc.most of the central gait disorders regarding the pathology and their appearance can not be called \"parkinsonism\"; these are much closer related to the localization of lesions rather than to the diagnostic categories.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the major neurological diseases affecting elderly subjects. Presumed prevalence of PD is 80-100 per 100 thousands and it is estimated that there are approximately 100 thousands patients in Japan. From a statistic on age distribution of patients visiting doctors, it is estimated that patients with ages at 75-79(639/100,000) and 80-84(632/100,000) are highest in number. Juvenile parkinsonism is a syndrome with parkinsonian motor symptoms and dystonia developing before and after ten years of age. Reports on this syndrome have been accumulated in Japan and gene abnormality in a enzyme relating to dopamine metabolism was discovered in the hereditary progressive dystonia with marked diurnal fluctuation (Segawa). Among symptomatic parkinsonism, cerebrovascular parkinsonism is mainly due to multiple infarction in the basal ganglia or Binswanger's disease in Japan, and both conditions develops parkinsonism, pseudobulbar palsy and dementia progressively. Diffuse Lewy body disease and a unique type of progressive supranuclear palsy presenting a disorder designated \"pure akinesia\" were studied mainly in Japan. In drug therapies of PD, it has been argued why the maintenance dose of levodopa or dopamine agonists was generally low in Japan. In addition to constitution and drug metabolism, attitude of Japanese people to worry side effects more than merit with beneficial effects by a drug may have inevitably lead to low maintenance dose. Development of new drugs have been undertaken in parallel with US and Europe. Talipexole hydrochloride has been on market in Japan recently, but MAO-B inhibitors and COMT inhibitors are in final stages to wait evaluations by the governmental committee.",

Other monosymptomatic disorders are often referred to as essential tremor variants. Recent findings There is now solid evidence that essential tremor, however defined, is a syndrome with multiple causes. Summary A new tremor classification scheme is being developed by the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society Task Force on Tremor. In this scheme, tremor in the absence of other neurological signs is called isolated tremor, and tremor in combination with other signs is called combined tremor. Many isolated and combined tremor syndromes can be defined on the basis of commonly recurring or unique clinical symptoms and signs, including historical features (age at onset, family history, and temporal evolution) and tremor characteristics (body distribution, activation condition, associated features). Essential tremor, however defined, is simply a syndrome and not a specific disease. Essential tremor should be defined and used consistently, or this term should be abandoned. As essential tremor is an arbitrarily defined syndrome, it makes no sense to refer to other tremors as variants of essential tremor or essential tremor syndromes.",

One treatment that improves the symptoms involves sending electricity to deep parts of the brain. A problem with the treatment is determining how much electricity to send and when to send it. Without knowing these things, sometimes too much electricity is used and side effects can occur or too little stimulation is sent and the patient’s symptoms do not improve. A solution to this problem would be providing feedback to the device, telling the device how bad the symptoms are at a certain time, so that the amount of electricity used can be adjusted. This way the device could send stimulation only when the patient really needs it (when they have bad symptoms). Scientists think that brain signals may make a good feedback signal for these devices. Since Parkinson’s disease is a brain disorder, brain activity during symptoms may be different from when there are no symptoms.",

Anxiety occurs more frequently in PD than in most other medical illnesses of comparable disability. Thus, anxiety may be etiologically related to the neurobiological changes that accompany PD and not simply a behavioral reaction to chronic disability. The anxiety disorder in PD tends to be panic, phobic, or generalized anxiety disorder. It can be a manifestation of an \"off\" state, can be worsened by motor fluctuations, or can occur independently from—and even precede—motor manifestations. Anxiety in PD may be directly related to dopaminergic deficit or may be the result of imbalance in other neurochemical pathways. The neurotransmitters primarily implicated in the pathogenesis of anxiety are norepinephrine, serotonin, and γ-aminobutyric acid, as well as some neuropeptides. The key to successful management of anxiety in PD is its early recognition. A \"team approach\" to treatment that includes pharmacological and nonpharmacological measures, such as education, counseling, and stress-reduction strategies, is most beneficial, particularly in a complex illness where motor and behavioral dysfunction are often intertwined and tend to affect each other. Well-designed studies that address the pharmacological management of anxiety in PD are needed. Nonetheless, based on clinical experience, the effective agents for primary anxiety disorders seem comparably efficacious in PD-related anxiety.",

Smoking is one of the determinants of PD that has been studied most frequently. For the diagnosis of PD, the postmortem neuropathologic examination of the brain is generally considered to be the gold standard. For the clinical diagnosis of PD, the generally accepted prerequisite is assessment of the presence of Parkinsonism, based on a combination of four typical clinical features, referred to as cardinal signs, that is, resting tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, and impaired postural reflexes.

      "abstract": "Das maligne neuroleptische Syndrom (MNS) wurde zuerst als eine lebensbedrohliche Komplikation der Behandlung mit Dopaminrezeptorantagonisten beschrieben und ist durch extrapyramidal-motorische Störungen, Hyperthermie und erhöhte Werte der Serumkreatinkinase charakterisiert. Inzwischen ist bekannt, dass neben klassischen Neuroleptika auch andere Medikamente das MNS auslösen können. Es zeigte sich auch, dass identische oder zumindest sehr ähnliche Krankheitsbilder bei Parkinsonpatienten auftreten können, entweder als akinetische hypertherme Parkinsonkrise oder nach Entzug der Parkinsonmedikation. Die pathophysiologische Grundlage dieser Syndrome ist wahrscheinlich ein Zusammenbruch der zentralen dopaminergen Transmission mit nachfolgender Hyperaktivität exzitatorischer Aminosäuretransmitter wie Glutamat. Die Störungen spielen sich wahrscheinlich in den Basalganglien und im Hypothalamus ab. Der wichtigste Schritt der Behandlung ist das Erkennen des MNS. Die Prognose ist gut, wenn die verursachende Medikation abgesetzt oder die Parkinsontherapie wieder begonnen wird. Unterstützend wirken Rehydrierung und Senken der Körpertemperatur. Zusätzlich können Dopaminrezepto-ragonisten, Antagonisten der Glutamatrezeptoren oder Dan-trolen eingesetzt werden. Der Wert dieser zusätzlichen Pharmakotherapie ist jedoch umstritten. Bei Patienten mit einer positiven MNS-Anamnese und behandlungsbedürftiger Psychose können klassische Neuroleptika bei vorsichtiger Aufdosierung und stationärer Überwachung eingesetzt werden, sicherer ist jedoch wahrscheinlich die Therapie mit atypischen Neuroleptika, insbesondere Clozapin.",

      "abstract": "Atypical forms of motor neuron disease represent a rare and diverse group of neurodegenerative disorders that differ from classical amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in terms of clinical presentation, genetic background, neuroimaging features, progression rate, and distribution of motor involvement. Diagnostic criteria of these variants include onset at a young or middle age, restriction to a specific anatomical region (bulbar or spinal), exclusive involvement of either the upper or lower motor neuron, the degree of motor neuron degeneration, absence of specific neuroimaging phenomena in certain subtypes, frequent association with other neurological symptoms (e.g., dystonia, parkinsonism, cerebellar ataxia, cognitive impairment), and slow progression. Depending on the predominant site of involvement, this pathology can be divided into two major categories: affecting the upper and lower motor neuron. The first group includes primary lateral sclerosis and Mills syndrome. The lower motor neuron group comprises a broader and more heterogeneous spectrum, including progressive bulbar palsy, progressive muscular atrophy, facial onset sensory and motor neuronopathy syndrome, flail arm syndrome, Hirayama disease (monomelic amyotrophy), O’Sullivan-McLeod syndrome, flail leg syndrome, and finger extension weakness and downbeat nystagmus motor neuron disease. A concise clinical characterization of each variant is provided. This article describes original clinical cases of two atypical motor neuron disease variants, i.e. O’Sullivan-McLeod syndrome and flail leg syndrome, analyzed in the context of a comprehensive literature review. Both cases, characterized by lower (peripheral) motor neuron involvement, underscore the heterogeneity of clinical presentation and the complexity of the diagnostic process, illustrating the necessity of a broad, multimodal diagnostic approach and emphasizing the importance of dynamic patient monitoring. In such scenarios, time itself becomes a key diagnostic factor.",

It was found that the early stage of the disease might include isolated depression, minimal movement disorders and functional compensation, the latter being observed during L-Dopa treatment. In general, the peculiarities of this stage comprise polymorphism of clinical symptoms, predominance of movement disorders over high mental dysfunctions and slow progression of pathological disorders with patient's adaptation to developing defect and reversibility of some dysfunctions under the treatment. The early stage was distinguished also by independence of high mental functions damage on movement disorders severity. More pronounced disturbances were detected in akinetic PD type in the presence of depression in the older patients. Depression may be a prodrome of movement disorders manifestation. The above peculiarities of the early stage are important for early PD diagnosis.",

      "title": "‘When Did My Tremor Start’: Can Essential Tremor Patients Pinpoint Their Disease Onset",
      "abstract": "Essential tremor (ET) is one of the most common neurological disorders among adults, and it is the most common tremor disorder.[1-8] As in other neurodegenerative diseases, age of onset in ET is chiefly assessed by the patients’ (or occasionally their caregivers’) self-report, which may be of little documentary value. Surprisingly, there have been few data that have examined the accuracy of patients’ reports of age of onset in ET.\r\n\r\nIn ET, dating the onset is not a trivial issue. Indeed, age of onset is a variable of considerable importance. First, late-onset ET could have different biochemical and neuropathological underpinnings from earlier onset ET.[9, 10] Second, as in other neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson’s disease,[11, 12] an association between older age of onset and mild cognitive impairment and dementia has been reported in ET (i.e., ET patients with older age of onset are more likely to have mild cognitive impairment and demented than are ET patients with younger age of onset, and older onset of ET is a risk factor for incident dementia). Third, age of onset is crucial when determining the rate of progression in cross-sectional studies.[9]\r\n\r\nIn this issue of Neuroepidemiology, Louis [13] analyzed the agreement in data on age of onset in 86 patients with ET from a prospective, epidemiological study in New York. Patients with ET cases were assessed at two time points (baseline and follow-up), and data on age of onset were collected each time by self-report. Despite the observation that agreement between the baseline and follow-up reports was high (ρ = 0.85, p 10 years.\r\n\r\nThe results of this study are of special interest. Aside from the fact that only a prior pilot study, conducted by the same group, had addressed this reliability issue in ET,[14] there were no other published data to aid clinicians and researchers. The study had several strengths, including the large sample size, the exhaustive study of the patients and the well thought-out approach to the statistical analyses. The study was not without limitations. Specifically, only 86 of 376 ET patients initially enrolled were followed up. However, these 86 enrollees were similar to the larger group of 376 from which they were drawn in terms of baseline tremor severity, baseline tremor duration and baseline age.\r\n\r\nLeaving aside issues of strengths and limitations, the study again demonstrates that age of onset, overall, is reliably reported. Yet investigators should approach these self-reports with some degree of caution. Differences in reported age of onset in ET can vary widely, and in up 1/5 of patients may be substantial. Louis [13] has proposed several approaches to supplement self-reported data in future studies. One approach would be to examine hand-writing samples (e.g., signatures, letters) retrospectively, as an objective record of the possible onset and development of tremor. Another one would be to use collateral history from family members. Despite this, the main question is “when does ET really start”. The answer still remains uncertain. Given the heterogeneous nature of ET,[15] this may differ depending on the cause/s of the syndrome. When and where the neuropathological process develops in ET still remains uncertain.",

      "title": "Early identification and intervention for infants at high risk of neurodevelopmental disorders",
      "abstract": "Developmental disability is a broad term encompassing many different diagnoses. These conditions, predominantly associated with the functioning of the neurological system and brain, manifest during infancy or childhood and usually last throughout a person’s lifetime. These are marked by delayed development or functional limitations in cognition, language, communication, behavior socialization or motor function, and are defined as ‘neurodevelopmental disorders’. \r\nMost neurodevelopmental disorders are caused by a complex mix of factors, that may affect neurological function. This might be due to genetics, due to conditions occurring during pregnancy, such as malnutrition, infection or parental behavior (i.e. smoking, drugs and/or drinking alcohol during pregnancy,…) or due to perinatal and neonatal complications. \r\nNeurodevelopmental problems due to injury that has occurred during the perinatal period can mainly be subdivided in 3 groups:\r\n-\tInfants with congenital malformations, including syndromes, chromosomal and genetic defects and inborn errors of metabolism\r\n-\tInfants that are born preterm and/or with low birthweight\r\n-\tInfants with a hypoxic-ischemic insult and/or perinatal stroke \r\n\r\nThis doctoral thesis focused on preterm birth and perinatal stroke, two main perinatal causes of neurodevelopmental disorders and improved our insight about the neurodevelopmental outcome, early diagnosis and early intervention of those high-risk infants. \r\n\r\nPART I of this dissertation focused on very preterm (VPT)/very-low-birthweight (VLBW) infants. The care for preterm infants has improved considerably in the last decades, however, they continue to face complex medical and neurodevelopmental problems. In the last few decades preterm births increased and the survival of VPT/VLBW have improved, however this is not accompanied by increased morbidity. Although most preterm born infants do not develop major impairments, they are at higher risk to develop cerebral palsy (CP), motor and/or cognitive impairments and the risk increases with decreasing gestational age (GA) and birthweight (BW). Recent actual mortality, morbidity and neurodevelopmental outcome rates among VPT/VLBW infants is essential for family counseling and evaluation of innovative approaches to enhance outcomes.\r\nThe first part of this dissertation comprises two chapters, providing an overview of the current prevalences of neurodevelopmental impairment, globally as well as for our local population. In chapter 1, existing literature regarding the overall neurodevelopmental outcome at two years corrected age in VLB/VLBW infants born over the last decade was reviewed and reported in a meta-analytic review. In chapter 2, the neonatal mortality and neurodevelopmental outcome in a national population-based cohort was investigated. \r\n\r\nPART II of this dissertation focused on infants with perinatal stroke. Perinatal stroke might not be as common as preterm birth, it is still an important group of infants because it is know that more than quart of the children with perinatal results in neurological deficits, however the exact number varies considerably between studies. Early detection and referral of infants at risk for intervention, rather than referral children with known CP has been called for. Nonetheless, this requires careful monitoring in the first months of development and appropriate early diagnostic tools. The literature on established and experimental approaches for the treatment of upper limb function unilateral spastic CP (USCP) in older children is comprehensive, however, in young infants this remain practically unexplored, despite evidence of a critical time limit for activity-dependent plasticity to influence the corticospinal tract development during the first years of life. Given the shortage of early intervention studies, very little is known about the feasibility of such intervention programs in very young infants. \r\nPart II is composed of two chapters, describing two original research articles. In chapter 3, the neurological outcome was for each specific type of stroke lesion reported in infants with perinatal stroke as well as the predictability of two motor evaluation tools (‘General movement assessment [GMA]’ and the ‘Hand assessment for infants [HAI]’) for early detection of USCP. Lastly, in chapter 4, a study was undertaken in infants with perinatal stroke at high risk of USCP to investigate the feasibility of a parent-delivered home-based early intervention program, comparing two therapy approaches, namely ‘Constraint-induced movement therapy (baby-CIMT)’ and ‘hand–arm bimanual training (baby-HABIT)’ and to address potential obstacles for further implementation. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, this dissertation provided some useful insight on the outcome of those high-risk infants as well as some newfound knowledge about early predictions tools and early intervention for infants with perinatal stroke. However, more research is needed in order to fully understand the impact of very preterm birth and perinatal stroke on the longer term and how early diagnosis and early intervention can be improved in high-risk infants.",

      "abstract": "This case had young onset parkinsonism beginning at age 45 mainly affecting the right side with foot dystonia and limb pain as an early and prominent feature.1 There was a family history of renal disease in one sister, stroke like episodes and dementia in another sister, and ischemic cardiac disease in the father. Single-photon emission computed tomography of the dopamine transporter showed bilateral reduced uptake and there was a good levodopa response and later development non-motor fluctuations. Although a number of parkinsonian conditions particularly genetic forms of young onset parkinsonism are in the differential, the patient also showed signs of renal (microalbuminuria) and cardiac (left ventricular hypertrophy) dysfunction which further narrowed the differential to conditions such as mitochondrial disease and neuronal inclusion body disease (though brain MRI did not show characteristic white matter changes). Given the severity of pain and renal involvement, Anderson-Fabry was considered as the most likely diagnosis. This x-linked lysosomal storage disease is caused by absent or minimal enzymatic activity of α-galactosidase and usually affects males in whom its fully penetrant but has been described rarely also to affect women.2 It is important to recognize this condition given the availability of treatment with enzyme replacement therapy (agalsidase alfa). The list of genetic parkinsonian conditions is increasing.2 Involvement of non-neurologic organ systems in patient or family members may offer clues to diagnosis. Anderson-Fabry disease specifically must be kept in mind in anyone with young onset parkinsonism with renal dysfunction and a pain (related to small fiber neuropathy). (1) Research Project: A.

      "title": "Think ‘neurodevelopmental syndrome’",
      "abstract": "SIR–Many thanks are in order to Shusterman1 for bringing to our attention the need for a broader concept of early neurodevelopmental abnormalities that will enable recognition of the multiple possible associated deficits that may ultimately be present as well. Surely, professionals in the field are well aware that, in the case of cerebral palsy (CP), while the motor deficit may be most predominant, associated disabilities such as seizures, intellectual deficit, learning deficits, speech deficits, and others are also likely to be present. The focus initially and often subsequently on the motor deficit alone, perhaps exaggerated to some extent by the current emphasis on the important Gross Motor Function Classification System, may at times prevent an early understanding by parents of the likelihood that associated conditions may be present. As is true with the full range of other non-progressive neurodevelopmental disabilities, diagnosis is traditionally limited to the predominant function/behavior abnormality as if it were the only condition with which to be concerned. Certainly this is now true for attention-deficit–hyperactivity disorder, which is not simply hyperactive inattentive behavior, but is often associated with intellectual deficits, learning disabilities, behavior disorders, and others. This is equally the practice in diagnosis of developmental coordination disorder (DCD), autistic spectrum disorder, and intellectual deficits as well. Shusterman's suggestion to broaden the definition (diagnosis) of CP to better enable an early awareness of other possible associated conditions is well taken and should lead to a more inclusive concept that would enable a better understanding of the ‘spectrum’ nature of the non-progressive neurodevelopmental disabilities. As an alternate to the proposed ‘early developmental brain injury/interference’, I suggest that the term ‘syndrome’ be added to the current diagnoses in use so that both parents and professional providers could more easily relate to and be prepared for the ultimate enlarged scope of these conditions. The already well-established precedent of the designation Down syndrome provides a useful example of how this change may be equally effective.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson disease (PD) is a multisystem neurodegenerative disorder that affects about 1% of the population over the age of 55 years and has mean age of onset of about 60 years. The Braak hypothesis proposes that the earliest pathological evidence of PD is found in the enteric nervous system, medulla and olfactory bulb, and only subsequently progresses (over years) to the substantia nigra and cortex. Non-motor symptoms, such as constipation, hyposmia and sleep disorders, may precede typical motor features of PD by several years. No treatment has been convincingly shown to slow PD progression (ie, a neuroprotective drug remains elusive). Symptomatic benefit from dopaminergic therapy is usually maintained throughout the course of the disease. The decision as to whether to commence treatment with either levodopa or a dopamine agonist needs to be individually tailored, but long-term outcomes appear to be equivalent. Advanced PD is complicated by the loss of non-dopaminergic neurones, resulting in symptoms that are largely unresponsive to dopaminergic therapy. Treatment with apomorphine, Duodopa or deep-brain stimulation surgery may be beneficial for selected patients with advanced PD. Non-motor symptoms, such as mood disorders, cognitive impairment, autonomic dysfunction and sleep disorders, are responsible for significant morbidity. Management often requires a multidisciplinary approach.",

      "abstract": "Cerebral palsy has been defined as a group of non-progressive disorders of movement or posture due to a defect or lesion of the immature brain. 1 Cerebral palsy is defined by clinical description only; there is no definitive test. It is not informative about aetiolgy, pathology or prognosis. The definition of cerebral palsy also lacks precision in that neither the age at which the brain is mature nor the severity of the disorder required are specified. Brain development is most rapid in utero and early childhood but continues at a diminished rate throughout life. There is therefore no biological rationale for choosing any particular age to define brain maturity. The defining age below whcih cerebral palsy may be recognised therefore varies between centres for pragmatic reasons usually associated with assertainment. For example, in Western Australia the criterion is set at 5 years, 2 since by this age any central motor impairments of congenital or neonatal origin will be apparent and can usually be differentiated from progressive disorders or isolated motor delay. Thus the definition includes a group of children with post-neonatally acquired brain damage resulting in movement disorder. Post-neonatally acquired cerebral palsy differs from presumed congenital or perinatal cerebral palsy in that there is usually no doubt that it was caused by a specific post-neonatal event such as meningitis or head trauma. Although there is an excess of perinatal morbidity amoung children acquiring cerebral palsy post-neonatally, 3 suggesting a prior vulnerability in some cases, post neonatally acquired cerebral palsy will not be considred further in this review.",

The correlation between pain and PD has been recognized since its classic descriptions. Pain occurs in about 60% of PD patients, two to three times more frequent in this population than in age matched healthy individuals. It is an early and potentially disabling symptom that can precede motor symptoms by several years. The lower back and lower extremities are the most commonly affected areas. The most used classification for pain in PD defines musculoskeletal, dystonic, central, or neuropathic/radicular forms. Its different clinical characteristics, variable relationship with motor symptoms, and inconsistent response to dopaminergic drugs suggest that the mechanism underlying pain in PD is complex and multifaceted, involving the peripheral nervous system, generation and amplification of pain by motor symptoms, and neurodegeneration of areas related to pain modulation. Although pain in DP is common and a significant source of disability, its clinical characteristics, pathophysiology, classification, and management remain to be defined.",

Obie grupy symptomów w znaczący sposób wpływają na poczucie jakości życia chorego. Zaburzenia pozamotoryczne często bywają pomijane, niewłaściwie diagnozowane i źle leczone, co prowadzi do komplikacji w leczeniu, gorszego funkcjonowania pacjentów i ich opiekunów. Jednym ze współwystępujących zaburzeń jest depresja. Dużo jej objawów pojawia się również w chorobie Parkinsona, co stawia przed klinicystą czy badaczem i używanymi przez nich narzędziami dodatkowe wymagania. Istnieje wiele skal klinicznych i kwestionariuszy samoopisowych z powodzeniem wykorzystywanych w przesiewie, rozpoznaniu czy sprawdzaniu postępów terapii depresji. Należą do nich: Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Inventory of Depressive Symptoms – Self-Rated (IDS-SR), Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ), Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS-Part I), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), Cornell Scale for the Assessment of Depression in Dementia (CSDD), Inventory of Depressive Symptoms – Clinician (IDS-C), Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Z rozpoznawaniem depresji towarzyszącej chorobie Parkinsona najlepiej radzą sobie skale kliniczne, szczególnie skala Hamiltona oraz Montgomery–Åsberg. Ich przydatność i skuteczność jest duża zarówno w badaniach przesiewowych czy badaniu nasilenia objawów, jak i w stawianiu diagnozy. Podobne cechy ma kwestionariusz Becka. Nieco mniej badań w tym zakresie przeprowadzono na Inventory of Depressive Symptoms – Clinician, choć jest to narzędzie obiecujące. Wersja kwestionariuszowa tego narzędzia, Inventory of Depressive Symptoms – Self-Rated, nie spełnia oczekiwań w rozpoznawaniu depresji na odpowiednim poziomie w grupie osób z chorobą Parkinsona. Podobne wnioski należy wyciągnąć odnośnie do Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale – Part I oraz Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Rating Scale. Do celów przesiewowych dobrze nadają się zaś Geriatric Depression Scale, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, Patient Health Questionnaire i Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale. Cornell Scale for the Assessment of Depression in Dementia może być obiecującym narzędziem do celów przesiewowych po przejściu większej liczby testów.",

      "title": "Representation of action in Parkinson's disease: Imagining, observing, and naming actions",
      "abstract": "People with Parkinson's disease ( PD ) exhibit slowed movements and difficulty in initiating movements. This review addresses the issue of whether or not cognitive representations of actions in PD are affected, alongside these motor problems. In healthy people, the motor system can be involved in tasks such as observing a graspable object or another person's action, or imagining and naming actions, in the absence of overt movement. As described in this review, the fact that the slowed real movements exhibited by PD patients are coupled with slower motor imagery and verb processing provides additional evidence for the involvement of the motor system in these processes. On the other hand, PD patients can still engage in motor imagery and action observation to some extent, which is encouraging for the use of these processes in rehabilitation. Findings across the different domains of action‐representation reveal several important factors. First, the nature of action is critical: patients' performance in observation and naming tasks is influenced by whether or not the action is in their repertoire and by the extent of motion required to execute the action. Second, people with PD may use alternative or compensatory mechanisms to represent actions, such as relying more on a third‐person perspective or a visual strategy. Third, people with PD show a lack of specificity, responding as strongly to stimuli related and unrelated to actions. Investigating action‐representation in PD has implications for our understanding of both the symptoms of PD and the cognitive representation of actions in the healthy system.",

Based on the underlying mechanisms, psychogenic (or functional) neurologic diseases are classified into three categories: conversion disorders, factitious disorders, and malingering. Abnormalities in patients with conversion disorders are involuntary, whereas patients with the other two conditions are voluntary. Malingering, in particular, might be purposeful for personal benefits such as financial reasons and escape from jail. Common phenotypes of psychogenic neurologic diseases are motor paralysis, sensory loss, constriction of visual field, and seizures (psychogenic non-epileptic seizures, PNES). Clinical features common to all kinds of psychogenic neurologic disorders include incongruity with ordinary neurologic symptoms, inconsistency (variability) of nature, degree and distribution in time, change due to distraction to other stimuli or other matters, and the presence of psychogenic factors in the social or family background.",

      "title": "Biological links between traumatic brain injury and Parkinson’s disease",
      "abstract": "Abstract Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with no cure. Clinical presentation is characterized by postural instability, resting tremors, and gait problems that result from progressive loss of A9 dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been implicated as a risk factor for several neurodegenerative diseases, but the strongest evidence is linked to development of PD. Mild TBI (mTBI), is the most common and is defined by minimal, if any, loss of consciousness and the absence of significant observable damage to the brain tissue. mTBI is responsible for a 56% higher risk of developing PD in U.S. Veterans and the risk increases with severity of injury. While the mounting evidence from human studies suggests a link between TBI and PD, fundamental questions as to whether TBI nucleates PD pathology or accelerates PD pathology in vulnerable populations remains unanswered. Several promising lines of research point to inflammation, metabolic dysregulation, and protein accumulation as potential mechanisms through which TBI can initiate or accelerate PD. Amyloid precursor protein (APP), alpha synuclein (α-syn), hyper-phosphorylated Tau, and TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43), are some of the most frequently reported proteins upregulated following a TBI and are also closely linked to PD. Recently, upregulation of Leucine Rich Repeat Kinase 2 (LRRK2), has been found in the brain of mice following a TBI. Subset of Rab proteins were identified as biological substrates of LRRK2, a protein also extensively linked to late onset PD. Inhibition of LRRK2 was found to be neuroprotective in PD and TBI models. The goal of this review is to survey current literature concerning the mechanistic overlap between TBI and PD with a particular focus on inflammation, metabolic dysregulation, and aforementioned proteins. This review will also cover the application of rodent TBI models to further our understanding of the relationship between TBI and PD.",

      "abstract": "This overview of Parkinson's disease is designed to serve as a background to the discussion elsewhere in this supplement on the pharmacotherapy used in its management. Parkinson's disease is a common progressive neurodegenerative condition associated with significant disability and negative impact on quality of life. Although the cause of Parkinson's disease is unknown, the pathologic manifestation involves the loss or dysfunction of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Characteristic clinical manifestations include difficulty with coordinated movement such as asymmetric resting tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia. These symptoms and their response to levodopa constitute the basis for a clinical diagnosis of Parkinson's disease. Postural instability and gait abnormalities occur in more advanced disease. Although there is no cure for Parkinson's disease, a number of pharmacologic treatments are available for managing the motor and nonmotor symptoms. Research is under way to assess the disease‐modifying ability of both standard and newer treatments.",

      "abstract": "Sleep Disorders in Old Age Abstract. Sleep disorders increase with age. Older patients rarely complain about sleep disorders, therefore it is important to ask about sleep problems. Insomnias, sleep-disordered breathing and restless legs syndrome tend to increase with older age. It is important to consider that sleep disorders may be the first symptom of a depression, anxiety disorder or neurodegenerative disorders such as dementias. Many factors can influence sleep in old age: it is important to inquire after sleeping habits including naps during the day, medication and comorbidity. Treatment depends on the causes. Insomnias should be treated mainly with non-pharmacological means such as cognitive behaviour therapy.Zusammenfassung. Schlafstörungen im Alter sind häufig und haben unterschiedliche Ursachen. Ältere Leute beklagen sich selten darüber, daher muss immer danach gefragt werden. Insomnien, schlafassoziierte Atemstörungen und das Restless-Legs-Syndrom nehmen im Alter zu. Nicht selten sind Schlafstörungen auch erstes Symptom anderer Erkrankungen. Bei Depressionen oder Angsterkrankungen, aber auch bei neurodegenerativen Erkrankungen wie Demenzen oder dem Parkinsonsyndrom können sich Schlafstörungen vor kognitiven Störungen oder motorischen Beschwerden manifestieren. Schlafstörungen können auch Risikofaktor für andere Erkrankungen sein, wie zerebrale Ischämien und Herzrhythmusstörungen. Vieles muss bei der Diagnostik und Therapie berücksichtigt werden: Schlafgewohnheiten nachts und tagsüber, Medikamente und Begleiterkrankungen. Die Behandlung ist abhängig von der Ursache und sollte vor allem bei den Insomnien nicht-medikamentöse Therapien wie kognitive Verhaltenstherapie beinhalten.",

      "title": "[Mesolimbic and mesocortical pathways in Parkinson disease].",
      "abstract": "In Parkinson disease patients who receive long-term antiparkinsonian medication, their original symptoms of rigidity, tremor and related motor disturbances markedly improve or disappear. However, the condition is still far from satisfactory in terms of maintaining independence in daily life activities even in these patients in whom the drug treatment is for improving motor disturbances. The reason is that they show abnormal behavior characterized by \"spending the entire day in an idle state, which is perceived as laziness.\"This behavior is very annoying for the patient and the family. Despite the excellent effectiveness of drug treatment, this propensity toward idleness in mental and motor functions is not improved. Despite the denial of the depressive state and the absence of obvious cognitive disorder, such patients lack ambition and spend their time idly. However, although their motor function remains subliminal, such patients can carry out motor activities when the situation requires, but usually they do not have the drive to move. If we use the current nosological descriptions, the former is called \"bradyphrenia\" or psychic akinesia or slowness of thinking and the latter is called \"akinesia\". Akinesia is composed of two cardinal elements \"bradykinesia\" and \"hypokinesia\". Bradykinesia is the evaluation of quality of appeared motor behavior, and hypokinesia is the poverty of movement behavior. These two symptoms differ essentially. Hypokinesia is much more essential and is a cardinal element of akinesia. It indicates that the current drug treatment is ineffective for the improvement of hypokinesia and bradyphrenia. That is, these symptoms are a result of a dysfunction different from that causing residual motor symptoms or a result of other additional dysfunctions developing during the pathophysiological course of the disease. The dopamine (DA) system of the dorsal striatal pathway projecting from the substantia nigra pars compacta (A9) to the dorsal part of the striatum (motor striatum) functions in the control of speed and dexterity of movement. On the other hand, the DA system through the medial forebrain bundle projecting from the ventral tegmental area (VTA-A10) to the nucleus accumbens, ventral striatum (limbic striatum) and the cortex is associated with hypokinesia and bradyphrenia. This association can be confirmed by a long-term follow-up of Parkinson disease patients and experimental animal models lesioned in the ventral DA pathway (mesolimbic and mesocortical pathways).",

      "abstract": "Several distinct clinical syndromes presenting with parkinsonism have been associated with subcortical neurofibrillary degeneration and the abnormal accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau protein in the brain. Mutations of tau have been linked with a small number of autosomal dominantly inherited families who present with frontolimbic cognitive deficits, behavioural disorders, and Parkinson's syndrome. Some of the sporadic disorders (progressive supranuclear palsy [PSP] and corticobasal degeneration) have been referred to by molecular pathologists as primary tauopathies, implicating abnormalities of tau in their pathogenesis. We have identified a sporadic parkinsonian syndrome characterised by bradykinesia, a variable response to levodopa, and a mean duration of disease of 9 years, which resembles bodig (Parkinson's–dementia of Guam), and histologically has close similarities with both PSP and postencephalitic parkinsonism. Further characterisation of these cases frequently confused with Parkinson's disease may broaden the clinical spectrum of parkinsonian disorders linked with neurofibrillary tangle formation. © 2003 Movement Disorder Society",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease, an idiopathic and degenerative disorder of the central nervous system, is characterized by increased reaction times (by as much as 0.1 sec) in voluntary movements and often results in among other symptoms unintended tremulous (oscillatory) motion of body parts not in action, termed as Parkinsonian tremor. There are however no definitive diagnostic test that can confirm the presence or severity of Parkinson's disease. This is a serious handicap especially since the drugs usually prescribed to control these symptoms have serious side effects and their dosages have to be tuned extensively. In the current work, we view an increased sensorimotor loop delay in Parkinson's Disease as a key distinguishing feature and hypothesize that this increased delay causes Parkinsonian tremor (as instability-induced oscillations). Through simulations and tests with two table-top experiments, we use this premise to gain further insight into the mechanism behind Parkinsonian tremor and draw qualitative observations about the features of tremors that could be used for diagnosis of Parkinson's disease and estimating its severity. We further discuss possibilities for a low-cost device or a smartphone app for diagnosis. We further explore ideas for detection of Parkinson's disease, before tremors develop.",

      "title": "Comparison of auditory hallucinations across different disorders and syndromes",
      "abstract": "Auditory hallucinations can be experienced in the context of many different disorders and syndromes. The differential diagnosis basically rests on the presence or absence of accompanying symptoms. In terms of clinical relevance, the most important distinction to be made is between auditory hallucinations occurring in the context of psychotic disorders and those that are due to a somatic disorder. Auditory hallucinations are also quite common in otherwise healthy individuals and are therefore not necessarily disease-related. As auditory hallucinations are often accompanied by hallucinations in other modalities, pinpointing the modality in which hallucinations are experienced most frequently may provide a first – albeit coarse – indication of whether the auditory hallucinations are part of a neurological disorder (mainly visual), a psychiatric disorder (mainly auditory), an ear disorder (mainly auditory) or whether they occur in the absence of any disorder (mainly auditory). Epilepsy is the most important exception to this coarse differentiation. Another traditional distinction between hallucinations occurring in the context of neurological and psychiatric disorders is that the former are assumed to start at an advanced age, whereas hallucinations in the context of psychiatric disorders typically begin in late adolescence or early adulthood. Although there are many exceptions to this rule of thumb – as in psychotic depression, late-onset schizophrenia and epilepsy – age of onset can still be a valuable clinical indicator. The content of auditory hallucinations is notoriously unreliable for differential diagnosis and the safest way to an accurate diagnosis rests with the detection of psychiatric and somatic comorbid symptoms.",

Major psychiatric diseases share similar structural and biochemical abnormalities with the sleep regulation system. Sleep disturbance is associated with many psychiatric illnesses and in fact predates the manifestations of psychiatric illness. Pharmacologic management of psychiatric conditions also affects sleep. Psychiatric conditions and sleep have bilateral mutual relationships in terms of the worsening or improvement of symptoms.

The clinical manifestations of diabetic neuropathy vary, ranging from predominantly sensory symptoms sometimes with associated neuropathic pain in diabetic sensorimotor polyneuropathy to asymmetrical or multifocal weakness, pain, and sensory loss in diabetic radiculoplexus neuropathy. There are different ways of classifying diabetic neuropathy. One way is dividing diabetic neuropathy into two major categories: symmetric and asymmetric neuropathies [2] (Table 1). Asymmetric diabetic neuropathies consist of three major types: diabetic radiculoplexus neuropathies, diabetic mononeuropathies, and diabetic cranial neuropathies [2]. Even though asymmetric diabetic neuropathies are less common than symmetric diabetic neuropathies, they are still important to correctly diagnose as they have different underlying pathophysiology, may be misdiagnosed as the other forms of neuropathies with similar clinical manifestations and perhaps most importantly may respond to immunotherapy or other therapeutic interventions. This chapter describes the asymmetric diabetic neuropathies in details.",

      "abstract": "Background: Impulse control disorders (ICDs) and dopamine dysregulation syndrome (DDS) in Parkinson's disease are motivation-based behaviours that involve repetitive occurrences of impulsive and uncontrolled activity. Psychiatric classification is currently inconsistent and unclear. An accurate conceptualisation of these problems is important to guide research and treatment. Methods and Results: The review considers conceptual and methodological problems underlying the diagnosis of ICDs and the assessment of their severity. Whilst having features of obsessive–compulsive spectrum model, ICD-5 may bring them together for the first time into a single category of behavioural addictions. Whilst matching clinical and biological evidence, any such psychiatric classification in Parkinson's disease will remain complicated by the interactions of pathophysiology and medication and fail to capture the range of subthreshold but still clinically significant symptomatology. Conclusions: A non-diagnostic, dimensional construct of disinhibitory psychopathology may be a useful tool to guide research and inform treatment. The role of dysphoria is suggested as a further important factor in driving some of these problem behaviours. This opens the opportunity for adjunctive psychological approaches in management.",

The main dysfunction is thought to be an impairment in the ability of the basal ganglia to produce timing cues for the initiation of the next motor segment of speech, explaining the association of acquired and re-emergent stuttering with diseases such as dystonia and Parkinson’s disease. Clinical Picture: We describe a 61-year-old man presenting with re-emergent stuttering and mild hypomimia, only to develop unilateral rest tremors, hypo- and bradykinesia, rigidity and gait difficulties one year later. Treatment and Outcome: His parkinsonism responded well to treatment with bromocriptine, but he continued to stutter. Discussion: This case illustrates the association between acquired or re-emergent stuttering and basal ganglia disorders, and highlights the need to assess such patients for an underlying aetiology.",

The syndrome can be caused by several pathological processes, but the characteristic pathological feature of Parkinson's disease is neurodegeneration accompanied by the presence of α-synuclein neuronal aggregates known as Lewy bodies. LBs and Lewy neurites are insoluble accumulations composed mainly of phosphorylated-synuclein, and they are distributed extensively in both the central and peripheral nervous systems. The distribution of Lewy bodies (LBs) may have a role in determining the phenotype of Lewy body dementia (LBD). Common misdiagnoses for ailments that are pathologically similar include Alzheimer's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal syndrome, multiple system atrophy, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, cerebrovascular illnesses, and essential tremor. This study examines the progression of pathology in cases of accidental and symptomatic Parkinson's disease, proposing a staging technique that is based on the easily identifiable spatial distribution of the lesions.",

      "abstract": "In human, striatal dopamine content and number of nigrostriatal neurons are known to decline rapidly beyond the age of 45 years [1]. According to our present knowledge, the nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons are the most rapidly aging neurons in the human brain. The dopamine content of the human caudate nucleus decreases enormously, by 13% per decade, over age 45. We know that symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (PD) appear if the dopamine content of the caudate sinks below 30% of the normal level. Thus, the normal aging of the system is slow enough so that the appearance of parkinsonian symptoms is not evident within the average lifespan. This is true for 99.9% of the human population. In 0.1%, however, the striatal dopaminergic system deteriorates rapidly. This small percentage of the population (see Figure 1) crosses the critical threshold and manifests the classical symptoms described by James Parkinson in 1817 in his famous book “Essay on the Shaking Palsy”. Parkinson’s disease (PD) may be regarded as a premature, rapid aging (of unknown origin) of the striatal dopaminergic machinery.",

      "title": "Molecular imaging in degenerative parkinsonisms: windows into the brain",
      "abstract": "Neurodegenerative diseases are characterised by progressive neuronal loss due to the accumulation of misfolded proteins into the brain, underpinned by complex geneenvironment interactions. Among them, Parkinson’s disease (PD) and other related conditions are defined by slowness of movement, tremor and rigidity, i.e. parkinsonism. This is caused by a progressive degeneration of dopaminergic neurons and impaired function of the basal ganglia. While diagnostic criteria are mainly based on clinical appraisal and definite diagnosis relies on post-mortem evaluation, structural and functional brain imaging allows to assess the intricate pathophysiological processes underlying neurodegeneration in vivo. Notably, positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging can estimate the pathogenic pathways involved in degenerative parkinsonisms. This includes impaired density of neurotransmitters receptors and transporters (e.g. dopamine and serotonin), altered brain metabolism, abnormal protein aggregation as well as neuroinflammation, all of which can be detected in early forms or even before the onset of motor symptoms in high-risk populations. My line of research aims at improving the diagnostic performance of degenerative parkinsonisms, notably by using PET/SPECT in addition to structural brain imaging. Moreover, my objectives include to better understand the pathophysiological role of tau deposition and brain inflammation in these conditions. Neurodegenerative diseases lead to motor, cognitive and emotional disability, and have a major impact on patients’ quality of life. They also place a tremendous burden on families, caregivers, and society. Although dopamine-replacement therapy and deep brain stimulation are valid therapeutic options, they are symptomatic and thus do not halt disease progression. In combination with clinical and other biological markers, molecular imaging will certainly contribute to gain further insight into the complex pathophysiological mechanisms involved in neurodegeneration and to help developing disease-modifying treatments.",

      "abstract": "Sometimes concussion is accompanied by an abrupt change in behavior, including psychosis or dementia, but concussion is not necessarily the cause. It is more likely that head injury can sometimes unmask an underlying predisposition to another neuropsychiatric disease that has already begun to manifest, often sub-clinically. Such unmasking may occur as a result of a brain injury superimposed on an already vulnerable brain, or a brain injury that contextually removes the individual from a routine that served as a reliable and dependable structural context. Thus, when abrupt neuropsychiatric manifestations such as psychosis or dementia manifest after concussion, a thorough neuropsychiatric evaluation should be performed, and one should not simply assume that concussion is the cause.",

Organic dissociative states are distinct from intoxication, amnestic disorder, frank delirium, or other organic mental disorders as specified in DSM-III and DSM-III-R, yet these diagnostic manuals have no inclusive category or coherent nosological approach to dissociative states not strictly psychogenic in etiology.

      "abstract": "Abstract: A 38-year-old woman experienced sudden onset of rest tremor in the left forearm 1 week after learning that her deeply loved husband was involved in an affair. The patient was in good health and had no neurological disease or prior trauma. The surface electromyography results were consistent with features of the typical rest tremor, and the increased glucose metabolism in the putamen, seen on positron emission tomography scan, was consistent with the early stages of Parkinson's disease (PD). Furthermore, her trembling symptoms were relieved significantly after antiparkinsonian medications. For this patient, stress played an important role in the development of PD. The mechanism may have been the direct effects of numerous neurotransmitters or dopamine depletion after its massive release during severe stress. This case suggests that severe stress can worsen the neurological symptoms and prompted early onset of PD. It is the first case of PD occurring so early in life after exposure to major stress, and arouses our attention to the effects of stress on the nervous system.

The fact that 4.62 million people are person with dementia and 400 million people are person with mild cognitive impairment are considered to be urgent problem and we must intend to perform dementia prevention from primary to tertiary prevention thoroughly. We perform dementia screening using touch panel type computer and we recommend person with mild cognitive impairment to join dementia prevention classroom. Therefore, we can prevent progression from mild cognitive impairment to dementia (primary prevention).

      "abstract": "To investigate the neuropathologic substrate for dementia occurring late in Parkinson disease (PD).We identified 13 patients with a clinical diagnosis of PD who experienced dementia at least 4 years after parkinsonism onset (mean, 10.5 years) and subsequently underwent postmortem examination. Despite levodopa therapy, 9 patients later became severely impaired and nonambulatory, requiring total or near-total care; this included 4 patients treated with 1200 mg/d or more of levodopa (with carbidopa), which was consistent with loss of the levodopa response. These 13 patients were compared with 9 patients clinically diagnosed as having PD, but without dementia, who had undergone autopsies.Twelve of 13 PD patients with dementia had findings of diffuse or transitional Lewy body disease as the primary pathologic substrate for dementia; 1 had progressive supranuclear palsy. This pathology also apparently accounted for the levodopa refractory state. Among the 12 PD patients with dementia, mean and median Lewy body counts were increased nearly 10-fold in neocortex and limbic areas compared with PD patients without dementia (P< or =.002). Alzheimer pathology was modest. Only one patient met the criteria defined by the National Institute on Aging and the Reagan Institute Working Group on the Diagnostic Criteria for the Neuropathologic Assessment of Alzheimer's Disease for \"intermediate probability of Alzheimer's disease.\" There were, however, significant correlations between neocortical Lewy body counts and senile plaques as well as neurofibrillary tangles. Senile plaque counts did not significantly correlate with tangle counts in any of the analyzed nuclei. Arteriolar disease may have contributed to the clinical picture in 2 patients.Diffuse or transitional Lewy body disease is the primary pathologic substrate for dementia developing later in PD. This same pathologic substrate seemed to account for end-stage, levodopa refractory parkinsonism. The occurrence of Alzheimer pathology was modest, but was highly correlated with Lewy body pathology, suggesting common origins or one triggering the other.",

      "abstract": "Many older adults, especially those with Parkinson’s disease, experience difficulties during walking. Mainly complex situations that require another action next to walking itself (talking, thinking or navigating) often lead to falls. In this thesis, we investigated the neural causes underlying these walking difficulties (by using fNIRS and fMRI). Interesting results were that older adults with Parkinson’s disease did not show increased activity in frontal brain areas during complex compared to simple walking. Walking probably takes much attention (reflected in increased frontal activity), which cannot be further increased in more complex situations. Besides, we found that deep within the brain (in the putamen), older adults with Parkinson’s disease showed altered activity during complex situations. Possibly, Parkinson‘s disease caused brain networks that normally are nicely segregated to be intertwined. This could be another mechanism underlying the inability to combine two tasks. In older adults without Parkinson’s disease, we did not find altered brain activity. Especially in Parkinson’s disease, the results of this thesis provide new insights and opportunities for development of therapies to improve walking.",

Psychiatric symptoms often represent the clinical onset of such disorders, thus potentially leading to misdiagnosis, delay in treatment, and a worse outcome. In this review, psychiatric symptoms observed along the course of several neurological diseases, namely Alzheimer's disease, fronto-temporal dementia, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and multiple sclerosis, are discussed, as well as the involved brain circuits and molecular/synaptic alterations. Special attention has been paid to the emerging role of fluid biomarkers in early detection of these neurodegenerative diseases. The frequent occurrence of psychiatric symptoms in neurological diseases, even as the first clinical manifestations, should prompt neurologists and psychiatrists to share a common clinico-biological background and a coordinated diagnostic approach.",

DIP manifests as a typical movement disorder, which makes it practically indistinguishable from idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) and requires differential diagnosis. DIP symptoms develop fairly quickly (hours to weeks) after the antipsychotic is started or after the dose is increased. Therefore, DIP is predominantly a clinical diagnosis that must be kept in mind when a patient develops typical symptoms during treatment onset or increasing the dose of drugs that most often lead to such an adverse reaction (ADR). DIP evaluation includes using the Naranjo algorithm, which helps assess a causal relationship between drug intake and the development of parkinsonism symptoms. The primary DIP treatment is the reduction of the dose of the inducer drug, or its cancellation, or replacement with another drug. In patients with schizophrenia and antipsychotic-induced DIP, dose reduction, replacement with another medication, or prescription of a drug with anticholinergic activity may be possible. The awareness of the doctor and the patient about the possibility of developing this ADR is crucial in the prevention of DIP. Therefore, choosing a drug with the lowest risk of developing DIP is necessary for pharmacotherapy.",

      "abstract": "Psychiatry is the branch of medicine which specializes in the treatment of those brain disorders which pri­marily cause disturbance of thought, behaviour, and emotion. These are often referred to as mental, or psy­chiatric, disorders. The boundary with the specialty of neurology, which also deals with disorders of the cen­tral nervous system, is therefore indistinct. Neurology mainly focuses on brain disease with clear physical pathology and/ or obvious peripheral effects on, for ex­ample, motor function. Mental disorders such as depressive disorder and psychoses have been recognized since antiquity. Modern epidemiological studies have demonstrated that they are both highly prevalent and widely dis­tributed across all societies. Overall, mental disorders account for a very high proportion of the disability experienced by the human race (see Chapter 2). Unfortunately, in most societies mental disorders still do not receive the recognition or a level of health ser­vice commensurate with their public health import­ance. There are several reasons for this. Probably most importantly, the brain is a vastly complex organ and the neural systems underlying mental disorders re­main poorly characterized. This inevitably means that our understanding of the pathophysiology is rela­tively poor compared to disorders such as diabetes or heart disease. The absence of a clear body of reliable scientific evidence means that competing unscien­tific views— and stigma— can flourish. Recently, how­ever, our neurobiological techniques have improved in sophistication and sensitivity to the extent that mental disorders have become tractable problems. Phenomena such as mood symptoms, anxiety, and even psychosis seem to exist on a continuum in the population, and the absence of reliable neurobiological measures creates difficulties in determining where the thresholds lie in the gradual change from normality to illness. In clinical practice, the use of diagnostic cri­teria can increase the reliability of diagnoses and re­duce the variations between clinicians. However, small changes in diagnostic criteria can have large effects on the resulting estimates of the prevalence of disorders. Unfortunately, the criteria themselves are based on very imperfect knowledge about the natural history or boundaries of the disorders.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most prevailing progressive disorder leading to neurodegeneration, typically in people above 65 years of age. Motor clinical manifestations of PD appear in a much later stage and include rigidity, tremors, akinesia, and gait dysfunction. There are also nonmotor symptoms like GI and olfactory dysfunction. However, they cannot be considered for diagnosis of the disease, as they are unspecific. PD pathogenesis is mainly characterized by deposits of inclusion bodies on dopaminergic (DA) neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta region (SNpc) of the brain. The major component of these inclusion bodies, are α-synuclein aggregates. α-Synuclein undergoes misfolding and oligomerization to form aggregates and fibrils. These aggregates gradually propagate PD pathology. Other prominent features of this pathological development include mitochondrial dysfunction, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and impaired autophagy. These all contribute to neuronal degeneration. Besides this, there are many underlying factors which influence these processes. These factors comprise molecular proteins and signaling cascades. In this review, we have listed out underexplored molecular targets that may aid in development of neoteric and advanced therapeutics.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive impairment and neuropsychiatric symptoms affect a substantial number of individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD). These non-motor changes can occur at all stages of disease, often years before motor symptoms manifest in some patients while occurring much later in the disease process for others. Lewy bodies are the hallmark of PD, yet not all patients with PD follow the same course or present in the same way clinically, either from a motor or non-motor standpoint. This has implications on assessment, intervention, and planning for the future. This review will focus on the cognitive and neuropsychiatric features of Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), with emphasis on neuropsychological findings. Differentiation between these dementia syndromes and other atypical parkinsonian syndromes will be mentioned only briefly, as the latter are covered in detail elsewhere in this issue. Neuropathologic, laboratory and radiographic findings will be presented, and recommendations for neurobehavioral assessment and treatment will be provided.",

      "title": "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI): a historical perspective",
      "abstract": "Descriptions of dementia can be traced to antiquity. Prichard (1837) described four dementia stages and Kral (1962) described a \"benign senescent forgetfulness\" condition. The American Psychiatric Association's DSM-III (1980) identified an early dementia stage. In 1982, the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) and the Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) were published, which identified dementia antecedents. The CDR 0.5 \"questionable dementia\" stage encompasses both mild dementia and earlier antecedents. GDS stage 3 described a predementia condition termed \"mild cognitive decline\" or, alternatively, beginning in 1988, \"mild cognitive impairment\" (MCI). This GDS stage 3 MCI condition is differentiated from both a preceding GDS stage 2, \"subjective cognitive impairment\" (SCI) stage and a subsequent GDS 4 stage of mild dementia.GDS stage 3 MCI has been well characterized. For example, specific clinical concomitants, mental status and psychological assessment score ranges, behavioral and emotional changes, neuroimaging concomitants, neurological reflex changes, electrophysiological changes, motor and coordination changes, and changes in activities, accompanying GDS stage 3 MCI have been described.Petersen and associates proposed a definition of MCI in 2001 which has been widely used (hereafter referred to as \"Petersen's MCI\"). Important differences between GDS stage 3 MCI and Petersen's MCI are that, because of denial, GDS stage 3 MCI does not require memory complaints. Also, GDS stage 3 MCI recognizes the occurrence of executive level functional deficits, which Petersen's MCI did not. Nevertheless, longitudinal and other studies indicate essential compatibility between GDS stage 3 MCI and Petersen's MCI duration and outcomes.",

The boundaries of disorders like bipolar disorder and schizophrenia in relationship to stress-related psychotic phenomena found in disorders like post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or borderline personality disorder (BPD) are often unclear. This chapter seeks to describe and understand these areas of overlap and ambiguity. Simple rules that allow accurate separation of symptoms into a single diagnosis do not exist. Diagnostic comorbidity and common underlying risk factors occur frequently. Psychotic symptoms need to be interpreted in the entire context of a patient’s presentation. The most important aspect consider about the role of psychotic symptoms in diagnostic formulation is the impact on the patient.",

Whereas dopaminergic (mainly motor) symptoms are well-defined, the nondopaminergic symptoms (mainly nonmotor, such as depression, cognitive decline, anxiety, apathy, fatigue, sleep disorders, sensory symptoms, postural control deficits, orthostatic hypotension, and urogenital and gastrointestinal symptoms) are frequently missed or neglected during routine clinical visits; consequently, they are underinvestigated and undertreated. The neglect of nondopaminergic symptoms is surprising because i) they occur in almost all patients with PD throughout the course of the disease,(1) and can even precede the occurrence of the classic motor symptoms; ii) they affect almost all aspects of daily life; and iii) have a greater effect on health-related quality of life than dopaminergic symptoms.(2) During the last decade, several initiatives have addressed this deficit with specific assessment procedures for application in clinical practice and research.(1.)",

      "abstract": "Sexual dysfunctions or quantitative disorders of sexual drive are difficulties that an individual or a couple may experience at any stage of sexual activity as pain or difficulty in achieving sexual drive. Sexual drive itself is realized through four phases: desire, excitement, orgasm or climax and comfort or resolution. Sexual dysfunctions specifically occur in the first three phases, while in the last phase there are sexual pain disorders that can also occur in one of the previous phases. We can divide them into disorders of reduced or increased sexual drive. These are rather frequent disorders, confirmed by surveys in which 43% of women and 30% of men in the United States, reported some form of sexual dysfunction. The underlying causes of sexual dysfunctions are organic causes, such as chronic illnesses, pregnancy, changes in the endocrine profile and psychoactive substances abuse, or psychosocial causes, of which the most common are depression and anxiety, followed by low confidence, unresolved intrapersonal conflict, relationship problems, prior sexual failure, etc. They are classified according to the ICD-10 classification by the World Health Organization and the DSM-5 classification by the American Psychiatric Association. The most important disorders are reduction or lack of sexual desire, sexual arousal disorders that are manifested in women in the form of lubrication problems, and in men as erectile dysfunction, orgasmic disorders, or anorgasmia or inhibited orgasm in women, while in men the most common problem is premature ejaculation. Finally, there are sexual pain disorders that include vaginismus and dyspareunia, which can occur in both sexes. The main form of treatment for sexual dysfunctions is cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy used in the treatment of almost all forms of these disorders that an individual can undergo it alone or with a partner. For some disorders, there are also pharmacological methods of treatment, methods of physical therapy, and surgical methods.",

      "title": "Profile, benefits, and barriers in disability certificate for Parkinson’s disease (PD): Insights from a tertiary care center",
      "abstract": "Dear Editor, Parkinson's disease (PD), the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder, presents with a combination of motor and non-motor symptoms. Studies indicate that the prevalence rate is estimated at 1 to 2 cases per 1000 individuals, with a prevalence of approximately 1% in those aged 60 years or older.[1] It is characteristically chronic, and the progression of symptoms leads to multiple disabilities as the disease advances.[2] Disability may increase due to the later onset of illness and motor and non-motor symptoms. A disability certificate is mandatory for accessing benefits such as pension and insurance enrolment.[3,4] A recent study found that chronic neurological conditions, including all neurological disabilities, formed only 5.1% of the overall disability certification in a tertiary care center.[5] This study aims to analyze the clinical and sociodemographic characteristics of PD patients with disability certificates from a tertiary care center in south India. Most cases were referred by the neurologist from the follow-up OPD to the Psychiatric Social Worker, who facilitates and provides information about the disability certificate and makes referrals to stakeholders. The clinical, sociodemographic, and Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores were the major variables, and a semi-structured interview guide was used to understand certain aspects of disability certificates, such as the barriers to receiving disability certificates and available benefits. From the period of January 2023 to January 2024, a total of 22 patients with a diagnosis of PD were referred to obtain a disability certificate. After assessments, 16 patients received disability certificates, and the remaining 6 encountered various obstacles, resulting in their failure to obtain the certificate. Sociodemographic profile of participants Most applicants were male (77.3%), belonged to the Hindu religion, and had an education level of SSLC (54.5%). Unemployment affects nearly half (45.5%), and most (86.4%) live below the poverty line (BPL). While 77.3% are married, urban and rural residents were equally divided. Most applicants (77.3%) hail from Karnataka. Clinical profile of beneficiaries The age of the participants ranged from 25 (minimum) to 73 (maximum), with a median of 49.05 years. The duration of illness varied between 3 and 23 years, with a median of 8.9 years. The duration of treatment also ranges from 2 to 21 years, with a median of 8.4 years. UPDRS off scores, available only for 16 participants, ranged from 0 to 58, with a median of 35.4. Finally, the age of onset of the condition ranged from 21 to 67 years, with a median of 40.1 years. Challenges, barriers, benefits, and suggestions The study analyzed data from semi-structured interviews to identify challenges faced by patients with PD in obtaining disability certificates and welfare benefits. Participants found that the disability certification process is time-consuming and cumbersome. Some barriers included scheduling appointments with stakeholders, obtaining signatures from various departments, and obtaining the certificate. In addition, awareness among patients about disability certificates and accessibility due to functionality as well as the distance are problems for the number of beneficiaries. Patients who availed of disability certificates received monthly pensions, while others received railway and bus concessions. Some patients did not apply for any of the benefits [Figure 1]. Some suggestions include improving awareness about disability certificates and their benefits and implementing policy-level changes to reduce waiting times. Future studies should focus on these challenges from a multi-centric perspective, especially among PD patients.Figure 1: Purpose of applying for disability certificate and sources of informationAcknowledgments We thank all the participants who contributed to the article.

      "abstract": "The concept of \"subcortical dementia\" is controversial, lacking clinical validation and having only a questionable pathological basis. Over 100 patients with Alzheimer's, Parkinson's or Huntington's disease, subdivided into three functional disability stages, were given a brief quantitative neuropsychological assessment. Patients with Huntington's or Parkinson's disease were less intellectually impaired than those with Alzheimer's disease at each functional stage. Criteria for dementia were present in all of the Alzheimer's patients but in only half of the Huntington's and Parkinson's disease groups. Patients with similar overall intellectual function scores had no distinct pattern of neuropsychological test performance. Depression, absent in patients with Alzheimer's disease, was present in half the patients with Huntington's and Parkinson's disease and was correlated with intellectual decline. The concept of subcortical dementia is misleading. The pattern of neuropsychological impairment is not distinct, and the neuropathological basis of dementia in these diseases may result from a combination of cortical and subcortical degeneration.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is traditionally characterized by the cardinal motor symptoms of tremor, rigidity, slowness of movement, and impairments of posture, gait, and balance. A relatively new focus of research and treatment is the nonmotor symptoms of the disease, following from recent understanding of the neuropathological stages. Disruptions of arousal, mood, sleep, and autonomic function before the first motor signs of PD implicate the lower brainstem, which is affected before the substantia nigra and dopaminergic system. In later stages of the disease, the pathology extends to the cortex, accompanied by impairments in cognition and perception. The articles in this special section advance our knowledge of the brain bases of the nonmotor symptoms of PD, including disrupted visual perception, impaired cognition across a range of domains, and psychiatric and artistic manifestations. Subtypes under investigation include those described by side of disease onset (left or right body side), predominant cognitive profile, and gender. Taken together, the articles in this special section reflect the field's growing focus on the nonmotor symptoms of PD, their brain bases, and the corresponding potential for their treatment.",

      "title": "Early Prediction of Parkinson’s Disease using Multiple SVM Classifiers",
      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative condition that primarily affects the motor system of the central nervous system. Slow motions, postural instability, tremors, stiffness, and cognitive impairment are among the motor and non-motor symptoms caused by the progressive loss of dopamine-producing neurons in the substantia nigra area of the brain. Changes in speech and voice, such as a drop in volume or monotonous or incorrect pronunciation, are among the main signs of PD. In its latter stages, Parkinson's disease can cause impairment and loss of freedom. Early diagnosis and treatment can offer patients and their families more time to plan for the future, including financial planning and making arrangements for long-term care, and can help postpone the development of disability and keep function and independence for longer. Different researchers have used SVM for early PD detection but datasets on PD are frequently unbalanced, with more samples from one class than the other. Unbalanced data may be difficult for a single SVM model to manage, producing biased results. Also, single SVM models can be prone to overfitting, which causes them to perform well on training data but poorly on fresh data. When the training data set is tiny, chances of overfitting increase. In order to resolve this problem, in this study, a collection of biomedical speech measurements is used as a dataset, and an ensemble SVM technique is used to improve the prediction of PD. Feature selection using regression and lasso is performed, followed by data normalization, and parameters of multiple SVM classifiers are trained to work together with selected features and scaled training data, then performance is assessed. SVMs have been utilized as SVM offer feature selection and can locate the features that are most pertinent for classification. Multiple SVMs are resilient to noise and can manage unbalanced data and can also help in reducing overfitting, two issues that are frequently present in medical datasets. The approach utilized in this article produced an enhanced accuracy of 93% in the analysis that followed, as opposed to 87% for the old SVM model using the same data.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Parkinson's disease (PD) is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases. The main pathological features of PD are the degeneration and death of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra-striatal pathway and the accumulation of Lewy bodies in neurons. In addition to the well-known hallmark symptoms such as resting tremor and muscle rigidity, Parkinson's patients also experience non-motor symptoms such as visual disturbances, hyposmia, and sleep disturbances. At the same time, visual disturbances appear earlier than motor symptoms. The visual dysfunction in early-stage of Parkinson's disease indicates the occurrence and development of the disease. The visual dysfunction in Parkinson's disease is due to the damage of retinal dopamine neurons. This study found that magnesium sulfate supplementation can effectively delay the death of retinal dopamine neurons in 6-OHDA induced rat model of PD and improve the motor symptoms of rats with anxiety-like behavior. Therefore, magnesium sulfate may provide a new option for the early diagnosis and treatment of Parkinson's disease.",

Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) in PD are various and are attributed to pathologic changes within multiple brain regions, to psychological stress, and to adverse effects of dopamine replacement therapy. Sleep disorders and mood symptoms such as apathy, depression, and anxiety may antedate the development of motor symptoms by years, while other NPS such as impulse control disorders, psychosis, and cognitive impairment are more common in later stages of the disease. Few studies report on NPS in the early, untreated phase of PD. We reviewed the current literature on NPS in PD with a focus on the early, drug-naive stages of PD. Among these early disease stages, premotor and early motor phases were separately addressed in our review, highlighting the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms as well as epidemiological characteristics, clinical features, risk factors, and available techniques of clinical assessment.

      "abstract": "Abstract The metabolic and anatomical substrate of most forms of mental retardation is not known. Because the basis of normal brain function is not sufficiently understood, the basis of abnormal function is understood poorly. Even in disorders where the fundamental biochemical defect is known, such as phenylketonuria (PKU) and other enzyme defects, the exact basis for brain dysfunction is uncertain. The outcome for treated PKU, galactosemia, homocystinuria, and lysosomal disorders is not yet optimal. The various forms of nonketotic hyperglycinemia often respond poorly to current therapy. Less familiar disorders, with or without seizures, such as deficient synthesis of serine or creatine and impaired glucose transport into the brain, and disorders with variable malformations, such as Smith‐Lemli‐Opitz (SLO) syndrome and the congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs), may initially be thought to be a nonspecific form of developmental delay. Less familiar disorders, with or without seizures and disorders with variable malformations may initially be thought to be a nonspecific form of developmental delay. Simple tests of urine, blood, and cerebrospinal fluid may lead to a diagnosis, accurate genetic counseling, and better treatment. Metabolic brain imaging (magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)) has also helped to reveal biochemical abnormalities within the brain. © 2003 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

      "abstract": "There are no standardized diagnostic criteria for psychosis associated with Parkinson's disease (PDPsy). As part of an NIH sponsored workshop, we reviewed the existing literature on PDPsy to provide criteria that distinguish PDPsy from other causes of psychosis. Based on these data, we propose provisional criteria for PDPsy in the style of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV-TR. PDPsy has a well-characterized temporal and clinical profile of hallucinations and delusions, which is different than the pattern seen in other psychotic disorders such as substance induced psychosis or schizophrenia. PDPsy is associated with a poor prognosis of chronic psychosis, nursing home placement, and death. Medications used to treat Parkinson's disease (PD) contribute to PDPsy but may not be sufficient or necessary contributors to PDPsy. PDPsy is associated with Lewy bodies pathology, imbalances of monoaminergic neurotransmitters, and visuospatial processing deficits. These findings suggest that PDPsy may result from progression of the disease process underlying PD, rather than a comorbid psychiatric disorder or drug intoxication. PDPsy is not adequately described by existing criteria for psychotic disorders. We established provisional diagnostic criteria that define a constellation of clinical features not shared by other psychotic syndromes. The criteria are inclusive and contain descriptions of the full range of characteristic symptoms, chronology of onset, duration of symptoms, exclusionary diagnoses, and associated features such as dementia. These criteria require validation and may be refined, but form a starting point for studies of the epidemiology and pathophysiology of PDPsy, and are a potential indication for therapy development.",

It has been neglected by medicine so little is known about its mechanism or treatment. However, there have been recent critical developments, particularly establishing it is as common as Parkinson's or multiple sclerosis and associated with poor outcomes and consequently associated with very high rates of disability and both health and social care costs. There have also been critical changes in its diagnosis. The historical requirement of identifying causative stressors has been removed as it is now clear that these are not found in a significant proportion of patients. Instead, there has been increased emphasis on identifying 'positive neurological signs' which allow its reliable distinction from other disorders. Such signs can also be explained to patients to help them to understand the basis of the diagnosis and how it can be caused by dysfunction of cognitive processes such as attention and illness representations, thereby increasing acceptance of a complex and stigmatised diagnosis. The widespread adoption of the acronym FND and therefore the term 'functional', an aetiologically neutral term, has also facilitated critical steps in uniting patients and clinicians. FND patients regularly have current and/or past comorbid symptoms presenting to other specialities such as fibromyalgia and Irritable Bowel Syndrome, which can be viewed as related disorders with overlapping mechanisms. Insights from FND research are therefore well positioned to inform the broader field of functional disorders which account for approximately 30% of morbidity and costs across medicine.",

However, increasing awareness of the clinical features of all these conditions, together with adherence to exacting diagnostic criteria, is leading to improved diagnosis, which is crucial for patients (who want to know what the future holds for them), for their treatment (giving them the right drug and not the wrong one) and for research (since all the different diseases above have different aetiologies and pathology).",

Nowadays motor symptoms have best treatments if we compare with those existing some decades ago, which in last term, permits other manifestations being the main disabilities in an advanced Parkinson disease. Among these disabilities cognitives are the most severe due to it's prevalence and devastating consecuences.We present the clinical case of a 72 aged woman who complains of cognitive and depressive symptoms, probably compatible with a depressive disorder, but finally diagnosed with Lewy body disease despite these cognitive manifestations are most common in advanced disease.We' re showing an interesting case of Lewy body disease due to it's incipient symptomatology in cognitive manifestations (which makes it interesting for psichiatric value), motor manifestations (interesting for neurological value) and organic manifestations as complementary tests demostrate. Finally, we justificate the usage of rivastigmine as the choice of treatment in these cases which onset is mainly composed by cognitive symptoms.

This multipeptide dysfunction leads to expression of a range of non-motor symptoms now known to be integral to the concept of PD and preceding the diagnosis of motor PD. Some non-motor symptoms in PD may have a dopaminergic basis and in this review, we investigate the evidence for this based on imaging techniques using dopamine-based radioligands. To discuss non-motor symptoms we follow the classification as outlined by the validated PD non-motor symptoms scale.",

All four main motor signs in PD (loss of postural reflexes, akinesia, rigidity and resting tremor) contribute to the truncal signs to some extent in PD. The reduced postural righting reflex appears first, and it is lost in an advanced stage. Loss of postural reflexes coupled with a flexed posture may lead to festination and falling. Postural deformities (antecollis, camptocormia, Pisa syndrome and scoliosis) are frequent and disabling complications. They are produced by several mechanisms, such as body scheme defects due to centrally impaired proprioception ; axial dystonia ; muscular rigidity ; weakness caused by myopathy ; and structural changes in the spine. The above-mentioned signs contribute to the Parkinson gait ; stooped posture, small shuffling steps, festination, pulsion phenomenon and frozen gait.",

The prevalence of dementia was found to be 29 per cent in 444 patients studied. The frequency of dementia increased with advancing age and the patients showing signs of clinical arteriosclerosis were more often demented than the patients without arteriosclerosis. There was, however, an evident association between the stage of the disease and the frequency of dementia. The most severely disabled patients displayed dementia more often than the mildly affected, both among the patients with and without arteriosclerosis. The demented patients showed significantly more severe rigidity and hypokinesia when compared with the non-demented. Increasing severity of rigidity and hypolinesia, in particular was found to have a positive correlation with the degree of dementia. The association between dementia and the degree of motor involvement is considered to suggest the role of subcortical structures in the patholophysiology of dementia in Parkinson's disease.",

Dazu können auch fortwährende Streitigkeiten innerhalb der Partnerschaft oder gar Trennungen und Suizide gehören. Noch immer werden derartige Fälle in der klinischen Literatur lediglich in Form von Einzelbeobachtungen beschrieben und nicht systematisch auf ihre Ursachen hin untersucht. Dies lässt sich darauf zurückführen, dass Kommunikationsprobleme in Partnerschaft und Familie nicht mit den in der Neurologie derzeit vorherrschenden biologischen Theorien allein erklärt werden können.

      "abstract": "Patients with Parkinson's disease (PD) suffer most visibly with such motor deficits as tremor and rigidity and less obviously with a range of nonmotor symptoms, including autonomic dysfunction, mood disorders, and cognitive impairment. The neuropsychiatric disturbances of PD can be as disabling as its motor disorders; but they have only recently begun to be studied intensively by clinicians and scientists. In this book, Patrick McNamara examines the major neuropsychiatric syndromes of PD in detail and offers a cognitive theory that accounts for both their neurology and their phenomenology. McNamara offers an up-to-date review of current knowledge of such neuropsychiatric manifestations of PD as cognitive deficits, personality changes, speech and language symptoms, sleep disorders, apathy, psychosis, and dementia. He argues that the cognitive, mood, and personality symptoms of PD stem from the weakening or suppression of the agentic aspects of the self. McNamara's study may well lead to improved treatment for Parkinson's patients. But its overarching goal is to arrive at a better understanding of the human mind and its breakdown patterns in patients with PD. The human mind-brain is an elaborate and complex structure patched together to produce what we call the self. When we observe the disruption of the self structure that occurs with the various neuropsychiatric disorders associated with PD, McNamara argues, we get a glimpse into the inner workings of the most spectacular structure of the self: the agentic self, the self that acts.",

Schizophrenia, depression, developmental disorders, acquired brain disorders (traumatic brain injury and stroke), and neurodegenerative disorders all have cognitive impairment as a manifestation. Cognitive enhancers can improve intellectual function and have been approved for Alzheimer’s dementia, dementia of Parkinson’s disease, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Cognitive enhancers are being developed for other cognitive disorders. There are many advantages for development of symptomatic cognitive enhancers compared to disease-modifying agents. Cognitive enhancers typically modulate transmitter systems. Cross-disease phenotypes such as executive function impairment may represent a development strategy for cognitive enhancing agents. Life cycle management strategies for cognitive enhancers include expanding indications to disorders with related pathophysiology or to different stages of disease severity and development of alternate formulations. Cognitive enhancers can restore essential cognitive capability and are a critical element of optimal care of patients with neurologic and psychiatric disorders.",

Motor symptoms are the most common features that may be associated with non-motor symptoms including psychotic symptoms. Objective: The aim of this work is to provide an up-to-date overview of the treatment of psychotic symptoms in Parkinsons disease. Methods: We describe 3 cases of development of psychotic symptoms, which occurred in patients with Parkinsons disease, and provide an update on the management of psychiatric symptoms manifestations in Parkinsons disease, by brief literature review. Results: Case 1: 42-year-old man, married, received a diagnosis of PD at the age of 38, presented auditory hallucinations, which occurred 12 months following antiparkinsonian drugs use. Case 2: 58-year-old man, without any notable history, received a diagnosis of PD at the age of 41, presented jealousy delusions and behavioral disorders, which occurred 12 years following antiparkinsonian drugs use. Case 3: 76-year-old man, received a diagnosis of PD at the age of 40, presented visual hallucinations, subjective sensation of a presence and jealousy delusion, which occurred 26 years following antiparkinsonian drugs use. Conclusion: Psychotic symptoms in Parkinsons disease are frequent. Management consists of treating psychotic symptoms without worsening motor symptoms related to hypo-dopaminergia.",

      "title": "Cognitive Impairment in Parkinson’s Disease: An Updated Overview Focusing on Emerging Pharmaceutical Treatment Approaches",
      "abstract": "Cognitive impairment in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) is one of the commonest and most disabling non-motor manifestations during the course of the disease. The clinical spectrum of PD-related cognitive impairment includes subjective cognitive decline (SCD), mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and PD dementia (PDD). As the disease progresses, cognitive decline creates a significant burden for the family members and/or caregivers of patients with PD, and has a great impact on quality of life. Current pharmacological treatments have demonstrated partial efficacy and failed to halt disease progression, and novel, effective, and safe therapeutic strategies are required. Accumulating preclinical and clinical evidence shows that several agents may provide beneficial effects on patients with PD and cognitive impairment, including ceftriaxone, ambroxol, intranasal insulin, nilotinib, atomoxetine, mevidalen, blarcamesine, prasinezumab, SYN120, ENT-01, NYX-458, GRF6021, fosgonimeton, INT-777, Neuropeptide S, silibinin, osmotin, cordycepin, huperzine A, fibroblast growth factor 21, Poloxamer 188, ginsenoside Rb1, thioredoxin-1, tangeretin, istradefylline and Eugenia uniflora. Potential underlying mechanisms include the inhibition of a-synuclein aggregation, the improvement of mitochondrial function, the regulation of synaptic plasticity, an impact on the gut–brain axis, the modulation of neuroinflammation and the upregulation of neurotrophic factors, as well as cholinergic, dopaminergic, serotoninergic and norepinephrine neurotransmission. In this updated overview, we aim to cover the clinical aspects of the spectrum of PD-related cognitive impairment and discuss recent evidence on emerging treatment approaches that are under investigation at a preclinical and clinical level. Finally, we aim to provide additional insights and propose new ideas for investigation that may be feasible and effective for the spectrum of PD-related cognitive impairment.",

Pathologically PD is characterized by neuronal inclusions of abnormally aggregated α-synuclein in the form of Lewy bodies and neurites [2]. These target the nigro-striatal and meso-frontal dopaminergic projections impairing limb movement and executive functions, respectively. They also cause cholinergic neuronal loss from the nucleus basalis leading to attentional and memory deficits, serotonergic neuronal loss from the median raphe nuclei leading to affective and sleep disorders, and noradrenergic neuronal loss from the locus ceruleus resulting in REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD), depression, and anxiety.",

      "title": "Classification of Immune-Mediated Neuropathies",
      "abstract": "Neuropathies of peripheral nerves may be classified according to various criteria. The most important classification is the one according to the etiology, which differentiates between acquired or inherited forms. Among the acquired and hereditary neuropathies further subdivision has been proposed. Acquired and hereditary neuropathies are classified according to the course as acute or chronic. Acquired and hereditary neuropathies may be accompanied by involvement of other systems/organs/tissues or not. The latter are further classified according to the degree of co-affection of other organs or tissues as dominant or non-dominant. In non-dominant cases, neuropathy is overshadowed by manifestations of other organs. The course may be chronic progressive or relapsing remitting (Tangier's disease, porphyrias). Progressive neuropathies may be slowly or rapidly progressive. According to the number of affected nerves, mononeuropathies and polyneuropathies (PNPs) are distinguished. Among PNPs those with uniform affection of all nerves and those with predominant affection of several single nerves (multiplex neuropathy) are differentiated. PNPs are further classified according to the distribution as symmetric or asymmetric and as proximal or distal. Furthermore, neuropathies of the cranial nerves and the peripheral nerves are delineated. According to the direction of progression neuropathies can be ascending or descending. According to the types of nerve fibers affected they may be classified as motor, sensory, autonomic, or mixed neuropathies. According to the size of affected fibers, large- and small-fiber neuropathies (LFNs, SFNs) are delineated. Upon electrophysiological findings, axonal, demyelinating (with or without conduction block), or mixed neuropathies are differentiated. According to the prevalence, they may be classified as frequent or infrequent (rare). Neuropathies can be painful or painless. Neuropathies can be length-dependent (i.e. distal, the longer the more severe, dying-back), which is the case for most of the neuropathies, or length-independent. Lastly, neuropathies may have an infantile/childhood onset or may have an onset in adolescence/adulthood. Some neuropathies may be accessible to treatment, others may not.",

      "abstract": "Back to table of contents Previous article Next article Clinical and Research NewsFull AccessDepression May Be Linked to Onset of Parkinson’sVabren WattsVabren WattsSearch for more papers by this authorPublished Online:6 Dec 2013https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.pn.2013.11b7Multiple studies have indicated that depression can greatly increase the probability of developing cancer and having a stroke, but a study published October 3 in Neurology reported that depression appears to increase the risk for Parkinson’s disease as well.Of all the comorbid psychiatric diagnoses associated with Parkinson’s disease (PD), mood disorders are the most prevalent—showing up in approximately 40 percent of patients with PD, according to the Parkinson’s Disease Foundation. Many studies have shown mood disorders, such as depression, to be a consequence of PD, but recent studies have suggested that the onset of PD may be a consequence of depression.“[I]t’s a long debate whether depression is a risk for PD, or merely a comorbidity or a prodromal symptom,” said Albert Yang, M.D., Ph.D., a professor of psychiatry at Taipei Veterans General Hospital in Taiwan, during an interview with Psychiatric News.He explained that “studies have shown that depression precedes PD development… [but] such evidence has originated primarily from case-control studies that were limited by a small sample size and recall bias of the depression diagnosis.”In an effort to determine a correlation between depression and PD onset, Yang and his colleagues analyzed medical records of 4,634 people with depression and 18,544 individuals who were free of depression for at least 10 years. Depression diagnosis codes were based on the ICD-9-CM. Diagnosis for PD was determined by neurologists.The study results showed that people with depression were three times more likely to develop PD than were those without depression. Among the cohort with depression, participants over age 65 and individuals with more than a five-year history of treatment-resistant depression prior to PD diagnosis showed the greatest risk for PD onset.“This study highlights the necessity of thinking about neurodegenerative disorders in certain depressive patients. Our study does not say that all depression leads to Parkinson’s disease, but identified that elderly depression and difficult-to-treat depression could need particular attention and possibly aggressive treatment for these patients,” said Yang. When providing care to these populations, Yang suggested that “it may be beneficial to screen for any neurological disease, as depression may be a red flag.”James Beck, Ph.D., vice president of Scientific Affairs at the Parkinson’s Disease Foundation, agreed. “It would be worthwhile to screen for Parkinson’s disease,” Beck told Psychiatric News. “Many symptoms of depression are also symptoms seen in patients with Parkinson’s disease.” Because several studies have shown a strong interrelationship between depression and PD, Beck said that is highly possible that depression and PD could be consistent on a biological basis.Few genetic association studies have focused on the correlation between PD and depression, according to Yang. He noted that genes studied to date include serotonergic genes and the thyrotrophic embryonic factor gene, but none of the studies have been replicated by a sufficient number studies and subjects.“I am less optimistic in genetic association studies, although our group has also published many of them in aging, mood disorders, and schizophrenia.”Yang acknowledged limitations in his current study, including lack of information on family history of PD, smoking, coffee drinking, and environmental factors such as exposure to pesticides—all factors that can influence PD development, he said.He added that more population-based studies with longer-duration observations will be conducted, along with studies identifying the overlap of neuroimaging markers for depression and PD.The study was funded by the Taipei Veterans General Hospital and the National Science Council.“Risk of Parkinson Disease After Depression: A Nationwide Population-Based Study” is posted at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=albert+yang+parkinson’s+disease.

      "abstract": "Common endocrine disorders often present with psychiatric symptoms and may be mistaken for primary psychiatric disorders. Dysregulation of the following endocrine systems commonly affects behavior: the adrenocorticoid system, the thyroid system, the parathyroid system, the pancreas and regulation of glucose, and the reproductive system. Symptoms of depression and anxiety are common across the spectrum of endocrine disorders and more severe cases may include psychotic features. Clinicians are often faced with the challenge of identifying an underlying endocrine etiology for behavioral changes based on relatively nonspecific symptoms. A general understanding of the signs and symptoms associated with elevated or decreased hormone levels can assist in the differential diagnosis and ultimately increase the likelihood that a patient receives appropriate treatment. Accurate diagnosis can be especially critical in acute behavioral emergencies.",

      "title": "Mucopolysaccharidosis type II",
      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics Mucopolysaccharidosis type II (MPS II; also known as Hunter syndrome) is an X-linked multisystem disorder characterized by glycosaminoglycan (GAG) accumulation. The vast majority of affected individuals are male; on rare occasion heterozygous females manifest findings. Age of onset, disease severity, and rate of progression vary significantly among affected males. In those with early progressive disease, CNS involvement (manifest primarily by progressive cognitive deterioration), progressive airway disease, and cardiac disease usually result in death in the first or second decade of life. In those with slowly progressive disease, the CNS is not (or is minimally) affected, although the effect of GAG accumulation on other organ systems may be early progressive to the same degree as in those who have progressive cognitive decline. Survival into the early adult years with normal intelligence is common in the slowly progressing form of the disease. Additional findings in both forms of MPS II include: short stature; macrocephaly with or without communicating hydrocephalus; macroglossia; hoarse voice; conductive and sensorineural hearing loss; hepatosplenomegaly; dysostosis multiplex; spinal stenosis; and carpal tunnel syndrome. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of MPS II is established in a male proband by identification of deficient iduronate 2-sulfatase (I2S) enzyme activity in white cells, fibroblasts, or plasma in the presence of normal activity of at least one other sulfatase. Detection of a hemizygous pathogenic variant in IDS confirms the diagnosis in a male proband with an unusual phenotype or a phenotype that does not match the results of GAG testing. The diagnosis of MPS II is usually established in a female proband with suggestive clinical features by identification of a heterozygous IDS pathogenic variant on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Interventions commonly include: developmental, occupational, and physical therapy; shunting for hydrocephalus; tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy; positive pressure ventilation (CPAP or tracheostomy); carpal tunnel release; cardiac valve replacement; inguinal hernia repair; hip replacement. Prevention of primary manifestations: Weekly enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with infusions of idursulfase (Elaprase®), a recombinant form of human iduronate 2-sulfatase, is approved to treat somatic manifestations and prolong survival. Pretreatment with anti-inflammatory drugs or antihistamines may be needed for mild or moderate infusion reactions. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) (using umbilical cord blood or bone marrow) could provide sufficient enzyme activity to slow or stop the progression of the disease; however, no controlled clinical studies have been conducted in MPS II. Prevention of secondary complications: Anesthesia is best administered in centers familiar with the potential complications in persons with MPS II. Surveillance: Depends on organ system and disease severity and usually includes annual: cardiology evaluation and echocardiogram; pulmonary evaluation including pulmonary function testing; audiogram; ophthalmology examination; developmental assessment; neurologic examination. Additional studies may include: sleep study for obstructive apnea; nerve conduction velocity to assess for carpal tunnel syndrome; head/neck MRI to document ventricular size and cervicomedullary narrowing; opening pressure on lumbar puncture; and orthopedic evaluation to monitor hip disease. Evaluation of relatives at risk: While clinical experience suggests that early diagnosis of at-risk males allows initiation of ERT before the onset of irreversible changes and often before significant disease progression, it is unclear at present whether the potential benefits of early initiation of ERT justify early diagnosis by either newborn screening or testing of at-risk male relatives. Genetic counseling MPS II is inherited in an X-linked manner. The risk to sibs depends on the genetic status of the mother. If the mother of the proband has the pathogenic variant, the chance of transmitting it in each pregnancy is 50%. Males who inherit the pathogenic variant will be affected; females who inherit the pathogenic variant will be carriers. Germline mosaicism has been observed. Affected males pass the pathogenic variant to all of their daughters and none of their sons. Carrier testing for at-risk female relatives and prenatal testing for pregnancies at increased risk are possible if the pathogenic variant in the family is known.",

The most common pathologic brain changes and the histological hallmark of PD is the presence of Lewy's bodies in the substantia nigra. Dysphagia symptoms in PD include difficulty with lingual motility, reduced initiation of swallow, difficulty with bolus formation, delayed pharyngeal response, and decreased pharyngeal contraction. Treatment for PD is focused on restoring (neuro-restorative) or preventing (neuroprotection) progressive nerve cell degeneration. Symptoms of MS involve both motor and sensory tracts, depending on the area in the central nervous system (CNS) affected. The diagnosis of MS is based upon patient interview, clinical examination, radiographic and supplementary laboratory tests such as a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and lumbar puncture. Seizures may result from hypoxia (lack of oxygen), birth injury to the brain, fever, alcohol intoxication/ withdrawal, brain tumors, head trauma, or stroke.",

      "title": "Disability and mental illness are different entities and should be assessed separately",
      "abstract": "The acceptance of the conceptual position presented by Üstün and Kennedy is of great importance for psychiatry and for medicine as a whole. Disability — whether defined as a functional impairment in terms of the DSM-IV or as a limitation of an individual's activities as is done in the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) 1 — must be assessed separately and not as a part of the individual's mental illness. It would be wrong to make the diagnosis dependent on the presence or absence of disability. Disability is produced by mental disorder, but it also depends on simultaneously present comorbid diseases or impairments. The latter is becoming a consideration of growing importance. A significant proportion of people with mental illness also suffer from physical illnesses and it is therefore difficult if not impossible to assess to what an extent the disability is caused by the mental disorder and to what extent it is produced by the comorbid conditions. Disability must refer to the person who suffers from a disease (or diseases), lives in a particular setting, receives a particular treatment and has personality traits that define the way in which he or she will live with a disease. Assets that a person with a disease might have — be it an artistic gift or access to wealth — will also affect the occurrence and severity of disability. The realization that the disability is linked to the person and not to the disease is of significance in developing rehabilitation services, in assessing the levels of support that society will offer to the disabled person and in determining what treatment can be offered if a disease occurs. Psychopathological findings define diagnosis but must be complemented by other assessments if they are to help in the estimation of \"caseness\" relevant to the provision of services or the estimation of needs for them. \"Caseness\" will be defined taking into account the psycho-pathological findings, the disability and the distress that the individual presents and relates to his or her medical/psychiatric condition. Persons with a particular psychiatric diagnosis can become \"cases\" for the mental health services when their disability is more pronounced (e.g., because of changes of the environment) or when their distress is enhanced (e.g., by learning about the prognosis of their condition). In clinical work and for research purposes, the assessment of the presence of a disorder, of disability and of distress must be accompanied by an estimate of their severity. The severity of the disease is usually assessed with reference to the numbers and the frequency of occurrence of symptoms, the severity of disability by the type and number of activities in which the individual cannot take part, and the severity of distress on the basis of analogy with states that the distressed individual and the diagnostician both know and have experienced. Severity can be measured as a dimension or as a feature that divides into several operationally defined categories. The same is true for disability and for distress, but not for the psychopathological symptoms, which must have features that make them recognizable as being qualitatively different from normal functioning. Severity of distress and severity of disability are usually correlated with the severity of the clinical syndrome, but this is not always the case. Distress might be linked to the vision of the future rather than to the level of disability or the severity of the clinical condition. The possibility that a black wart might be a melanoma will cause great distress although there are no limitations of activity and no certainty that the wart contains cells that are malignant or that it will be growing rapidly. The severity of disability might be linked to the severity of the clinical picture, but this is also not so for most of the time a person has a disease — with the exception of the most severe states of the disorder, for example in profound dementia or in a coma. People with a variety of psychopathological symptoms are often living in their community, with little or no limitation of their activity. The usefulness of the framework presented above for research purposes depends on the possibility of measuring syndromes, disability, distress and their severity in reliable and valid ways. The development of instruments that will help researchers to do this is clearly a major challenge for the ICD and the DSM committees. The usefulness of the same framework for clinical practice will depend on making the need for these measurements explicit and on training practitioners in making the necessary assessments. Practitioners have used the four dimensions mentioned above in dealing with people who came to ask for their help ever since medicine has been invented. A study of the way in which clinicians are operating may give precious information about their methods of assessment, which, when combined with results of research using valid and reliable assessment instruments, might allow the creation of training programmes that will make the classification of diseases accepted and used as a basis for research and for practice.",

They can emerge due to genetic factors or abnormalities in the brain or body acquired after birth, or because of faulty or incomplete physical experiences when learning more complex behavior. Many are first identified in infancy, but onset can occur over the lifespan. Some of these disorders are progressive in nature, whereas others are nonprogressive or static. Individuals diagnosed with these disorders display various motor, perceptual, intellectual, neuropsychological, and psychosocial impairments. The general intellectual functioning level of individuals with motor disorders is variable, with some functioning in the average range and others experiencing significant impairment. Psychological outcomes are also variable. Individuals diagnosed with neurodegenerative disorders frequently experience significant mental deterioration.",

      "abstract": "Diagnosis and treatment of Parkinson's diseaseAnosmia is a common finding EDrroR,-Niall Quinn's review on the recognition and differential diagnosis of parkinsonism' omits an important point-namely, that at least 70% of patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease have a defective or absent sense of smell.23About 90% of patients have rigidity and akinesia, and hence impairment of the sense of smell would be the second commonest feature of this condition, at least equalling tremor in its frequency of occur- rence.About half of patients are aware of this defect, and it is suspected, although not yet proved, that anosmia may precede the onset of the motor aspects ofidiopathic Parkinson's disease.This observation has important clinical consequences.If one suspects a patient to have idio- pathic Parkinson's disease and the result of a simple bedside test of olfaction is normal then the diagnosis should be questioned.In progressive supranuclear palsy (Steele-Richardson syndrome), which may simulate idiopathic Parkinson's disease, olfaction is normal.4Furthermore, provisional information suggests that patients with benign essential tremor also have normal smell identifica- tion scores.'This might not permit the distinction from benign tremulous Parkinson's disease as our limited data suggest that olfaction is normal in this rare variety ofparkinsonism.An ideal test for olfactory identification is the University of Pennsylvania smell identification test.Unfortunately, this is quite expensive, but a preliminary assessment may be made with every- day odours such as chocolate, orange peel, coffee, rose, and vanilla.As long as local nasal disease is excluded an important clinical sign may be documented.",

Caracteriza-se pela redução da influência dopaminérgica nigroestriatal e cortical. A prevalência da DP na população é de 550 casos por 100.000 habitantes aos 70 anos de idade. Objetivos: O estudo objetiva compreender o cotidiano das pessoas com a doença de Parkinson e o preconceito sofrido por elas. Material e métodos: Foi realizada uma busca eletrônica em bases de dados online, com artigos publicados entre os anos de 2011-2021. Foram encontrados 21 artigos sobre a busca proposta, sendo 5 selecionados de acordo com os critérios de inclusão e exclusão. Resultados: A instabilidade da doença e o fato dela ser progressiva e incurável constituem uma realidade difícil de ser aceita e suas consequências afetam a vida social do indivíduo. Relados demonstram os preconceitos vividos pelas pessoas com DP, que podem ocorrer principalmente devido às principais características visíveis da doença, como tremores, marcha parkinsoniana, rigidez e falta de equilíbrio. As pessoas acometidas percebem preconceito em relação aos sinais da doença que pode ocorrer por meio de olhares ou falas de outras pessoas. Os pacientes chamam atenção para sentimentos de pena das outras pessoas, piadas, desrespeito e olhares tortos que são comuns no dia a dia da pessoa com Parkinson. Para pessoas que permanecem nos empregos também é comum sofrer preconceito nesse ambiente devido ao julgamento sobre a capacidade de exercer suas funções. Conclusão: Compreende-se que a convivência com o Parkinson, engloba efeitos sociais, físicos, financeiros e culturais. O preconceito é também um fator recorrente e prejudicial pra qualidade de vida e saúde mental.",

High-risk and cohort studies demonstrate that children destined to develop schizophrenia tend to have delayed milestones and subtle neuromotor and cognitive impairments (particularly in coordination and language). These neurocognitive problems lead to difficulties in interpersonal relations, and their progressive alienation makes these at-risk children more likely to harbor odd or paranoid ideas. This cascade of increasingly deviant development may then be compounded by brain maturational changes during adolescence with a resultant lability of the dopaminergic response to stress. As a result, the individual is more susceptible to the effects of the abuse of dopamine-releasing drugs, and to other risk factors such as migration or stressful life events; social isolation may be a common pathway underlying several of the social risk factors.",

We present a case of an acute subdural hematoma that caused unexpected ipsilateral hemiparesis secondary to injury of the contralateral cerebral peduncle as a result of brain shift from this mass lesion. This phenomenon is termed Kernohan’s notch. We delve further into the pathophysiology of these and pathognomonic imaging features identified in our case report.",

Ich patologia wiąże się z utratą komórek nerwowych, zaś istota procesu chorobowego wiedzie do wystąpienia wielu objawów uszkodzeń neurologicznych, związanych z funkcją motoryczną (np. ataksja) oraz z pamięcią (demencja). Proces wiodący do pojawienia się objawów choroby neurodegeneracyjnej rozpoczyna się znacznie wcześniej, zanim się one pojawią. Przebiega często przez wiele lat i bywa bezobjawowy. Pierwsze symptomy pojawiają się gdy znacząca liczba neuronów ulegnie uszkodzeniu, bądź uszkodzenie dotyczy określonej części ośrodkowego układu nerwowego. Jedną z chorób neurodegradacyjnych jest choroba Alzheimera . Dotyczy głównie osób po 65. roku życia i dotyka 5-7% populacji. Czas jej trwania wynosi ok. 8-14 lat. Specyfiką choroby jest stopniowe i nieodwracalne zaburzenie homeostazy organizmu, zaburzenia procesów poznawczych i postępujący zanik pamięci, który prowadzi do zaburzeń orientacji wzrokowo-przestrzennej. Pojawiająca się apraksja skutkuje niemożnością posługiwania się przyborami codziennego użytku. W późnej fazie otępienie jest bardzo nasilone zaś pamięć często ograniczona jedynie do faktów autobiograficznych. Zaburzenia mowy są na tyle zaawansowane, że chory może wypowiadać pojedyncze słowa. Występują również zaburzenia emocjonalne, przejawiające się apatią lub agresywnością. Zaburzenia obejmują również problemy z przeżuwaniem, przełykaniem i kontrolą zwieraczy. Występowanie choroby w strukturze rodziny wywołuje liczne zmiany oraz wyrzeczenia ze strony jej członków.",

      "abstract": "The idea that loss of neurons could be associated with disease states and that certain microscopic appearances could be indicative of these arose in the mid to late 1800s. If neurons die, become dysfunctional, or are disconnected following a challenge, functionality of the affected neural circuit is compromised. Depending on the magnitude and localization, this may have relatively mild consequences (such as a learning deficit) or major consequences (such as developmental delay, epilepsy, cerebral palsy, or death). We are interested in selective or regional neuron death because they can help to explain the neurologic dysfunction experienced by an individual or give insight into the pathologic process that preceded death.",

      "title": "Beyond the motor impairment in dyskinetic cerebral palsy: neuropsychological and connectome-based approach",
      "abstract": "La paralisis cerebral (PC) se define como un grupo de trastornos del movimiento y/o la postura y de la funcion motora debidos a una lesion, interferencia o anomalia no progresiva en un cerebro inmaduro o en desarrollo. Estos trastornos motores a menudo se acompanan de alteraciones sensoriales, de la percepcion, de la cognicion, de la comunicacion, del comportamiento o de epilepsia, y se ha evidenciado que estos deficits pueden tener un mayor impacto sobre la calidad de vida que el propio deficit motor. Teniendo en cuenta la clasificacion de la PC segun el tipo de afectacion motora se identifica que la PC discinetica es un subtipo poco frecuente (entre el 3% y el 15% de todos los casos) que se caracteriza por patrones anormales de postura y/o movimiento, acompanados de movimientos involuntarios, descontrolados, recurrentes y, ocasionalmente, estereotipados. Este tipo de PC se ha asociado principalmente a procesos de hipoxia-isquemia en bebes nacidos a termino o casi a termino, y a la presencia de ictericia grave. Se ha evidenciado como la PC discinetica es mas incapacitante que otros tipos de PC, no solo por su asociacion con una mayor afectacion motriz sino tambien por una mayor presencia y gravedad de deficits asociados, como una mayor afectacion del habla y de la comunicacion.\nCabe destacar que los estudios que han analizado este tipo de PC son todavia escasos, probablemente debido a su menor frecuencia y mayor gravedad. Especialmente escasos son los estudios cognitivos y de neuroimagen, ya que las pruebas neuropsicologicas requieren de una destreza manual y/o de respuestas verbales y los estudios de neuroimagen implican la adquisicion de secuencias de resonancia magnetica en donde la persona debe permanecer quieta. \nLos estudios cognitivos realizados hasta el momento se focalizan principalmente en el rendimiento intelectual general, y evidencian que entre el 52% y el 65% de los casos presenta discapacidad intelectual. No obstante, cabe destacar que no existe un consenso sobre como evaluar el rendimiento intelectual en esta poblacion, con una gran variabilidad entre estudios. La aplicacion de tests psicometricos que requieren habilidades manipulativas y/o respuestas verbales pueden estar emmascarando e infravalorando el rendimiento intelectual real de estas personas. Los estudios que se focalizan en el rendimiento en funciones cognitivas especificas son escasos y se basan en muestras muy reducidas que a menudo no superan los 8 casos. Por otro lado, los estudios cualitativos de neuroimagen han hallado una afectacion de ganglios basales y talamo. Las primeras evidencias de estudios de resonancia magnetica de difusion apuntan a una afectacion mas extensa, con una mayor afectacion de la sustancia blanca. \nEs por ello que esta tesis tiene como objetivos principales: 1) identificar una medida objetiva de inteligencia adecuada para la gran heterogeneidad que existe en la PC, 2) describir el perfil cognitivo de una muestra relativamente amplia de personas con PC discinetica, y 3) analizar el estado de la sustancia blanca cerebral de esta poblacion mediante la tecnica del conectoma. Para ello se incluyeron en el estudio un total de 52 sujetos con PC discinetica y 52 sujetos control, a quienes se les administro una bateria neuropsicologia que evaluaba el rendimiento cognitivo general (mediante las Matrices progresivas de Raven - version color, el Test de vocabulario en imagenes de Peabody - III y la Escala no verbal de aptitud intelectual de Wechsler) y cinco dominios cognitivos especificos (atencion, visuopercepcion, lenguaje, aprendizaje y memoria y funcion ejecutiva) y se les realizo un estudio de resonancia magnetica estructural. \nLos resultados comparando las diferentes pruebas de inteligencia muestran un mayor potencial de las Matrices progresivas de Raven. Esta prueba demuestra una gran aplicabilidad en la PC, incluso en casos con una grave afectacion motora y pocas habilidades comunicativas. Tambien se evidencia que proporciona informacion completa sobre el rendimiento en funciones cognitivas especificas, tanto visuales como verbales, y que es sensible al estado de la estructura cerebral en fibras de asociacion y de proyeccion y estructuras subcorticales como los ganglios basales y el talamo.\nEn relacion al perfil cognitivo de la PC discinetica, los resultados a nivel grupal han evidenciado un rendimiento cognitivo por debajo del grupo control en todas las funciones cognitivas evaluadas a excepcion de la memoria de reconocimiento verbal. No obstante, estas alteraciones cognitivas se han relacionado con la alteracion motriz, hallandose una afectacion cognitiva mas generalizada a medida que incrementa la gravedad motora. En los casos mas leves, aquellos en los que existe deambulacion autonoma, se ha evidenciado un rendimiento similar al del grupo control en casi todas las funciones evaluadas a excepcion de las funciones visuoperceptivas, atencionales y de la memoria visual. Los casos moderados, en los que se requiere de ayuda para la deambulacion, han mostrado las mismas alteraciones cognitivas y se anaden dificultades en las areas de lenguaje receptivo. En el grupo mas grave, aquellos casos en que no es posible la deambulacion, se observa el mismo rendimiento que con el grupo general (un rendimiento inferior en todas las funciones cognitivas a excepcion de la memoria de reconocimiento verbal).\n En el estudio de neuroimagen realizado en una submuestra de 25 participantes con PC y 24 sujetos control, se ha demostrado una disrupcion de la conectividad cerebral a diferentes niveles (global, regional y a nivel de conexion). Este patron se caracteriza por una disrupcion generalizada de la sustancia blanca cerebral, pero una afectacion mas localizada de la integridad de esta, que incluye areas mas posteriores (parietal, occipital y temporal) y una relativa preservacion de las areas prefrontales. Tambien se evidencia alteracion en la conectividad hipocampal, asi como de estructuras subcorticales (principalmente en putamen y talamo). Por ultimo, se ha hallado una correlacion entre el estado de la sustancia blanca de la circuiteria sensoriomotora y el nivel de gravedad motriz (tanto gruesa como fina) y se ha evidenciado como la red formada por conexiones fronto-estriatales y fronto-parietales juega un papel relevante en el rendimiento cognitivo general de estos sujetos. \nEn el presente trabajo se discuten estos resultados en relacion a la literatura previa tanto en el ambito de la PC como en otras patologias, asi como teniendo en cuenta el desarrollo normativo.",

Based on both the classification of Parkinsonism in children proposed by Leuzzi and coworkers and the 2017 ILAE epilepsies classification, we performed a literature review in PubMed. A few discrete presentations can be identified: Parkinsonism as a late manifestation of complex neurodevelopmental disorders, characterized by developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DE-EE), with multiple, refractory seizure types and severely abnormal EEG characteristics, with or without preceding hyperkinetic MD; Parkinsonism in the context of syndromic conditions with unspecific reduced seizure threshold in infancy and childhood; neurodegenerative conditions with brain iron accumulation, in which childhood DE-EE is followed by neurodegeneration; and finally, monogenic juvenile Parkinsonism, in which a subset of patients with intellectual disability or developmental delay (ID/DD) develop hypokinetic MD between 10 and 30 years of age, following unspecific, usually well-controlled, childhood epilepsy. This emerging group of genetic conditions leading to epilepsy or DE-EE in childhood followed by juvenile Parkinsonism highlights the need for careful long-term follow-up, especially in the context of ID/DD, in order to readily identify individuals at increased risk of later Parkinsonism.",

      "title": "Deterioration",
      "abstract": "Summary: Intellectual deterioration in epilepsy may be real or apparent. The latter refers to delay in cognitive development such that performance against age‐related norms appears to drop. The former, real deterioration can occur due to concomitant degenerative neurological disease of which epilepsy is also a symptom, or it may happen as a consequence of one or more of a number of other factors. These include (1) direct effects of seizures and abnormal electroencephalogram activity on brain function, (2) traumatic brain injury secondary to seizures, including status epilepticus, (3) the influence of antiepileptic therapy, both drugs and surgery, on cognitive function, (4) psychosocial sequelae of diagnosis. Some epilepsy syndromes include intellectual deterioration as a frequent feature, with various causes. Developmental factors may also play a part. Cognitive functioning may be impaired by the presence of an epileptogenic lesion, and also in different ways and at different times by other brain areas involved with partial seizures, including irritative and functional deficit zones. Abnormal activity in these areas at critical periods in development may interact and disrupt pathways necessary for maturation of frontal lobe and limbic system functioning, leading to long‐term neurological deficits. Increased understanding of the mechanisms by which this may happen raises intriguing possibilities for prevention and remediation.",

The parkinsonian syndromes are the most common cause of paucity of movement; other hypokinetic disorders represent only a small group of patients.

Apart from this severe symptoms there are so many other symptoms too, many of which are severe, and some may occur sometimes. It generally affects the different nervous systems and the types of neurons. However, substantial attention has been paid to neurons in brain areas linked to overt motor symptoms, which are part of a key cerebral network important for movement facilitation. Dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra die slowly in Parkinson's disease,May start causing the nigra which tends to malfunction and creates a problem of typical moment types. Parkinson's disease is more common in those over the age of 50. It is a slowly progressing disease. The main aim of the paper is to prove that the neurodegenerative disorder can be solved using deep learning techniques such as neural networks and get a great accuracy.",

      "abstract": "The management of a patient with epilepsy requires the physician to address himself to two basic tasks: (1) an accurate diagnosis must be made with special attention to the possibility of progressive intracranial disease; and (2) an effective regimen for control of the seizures must be devised. DIAGNOSTIC CONSIDERATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH AGE Seizures beginning in infancy are accompanied, in about half of cases, by other evidence of cerebral damage, especially mental subnormality. The precise pathology often cannot be determined during life, although a cerebral developmental defect or birth injury is usually responsible. In a small proportion of cases a metabolic error, subdural hematoma, neuronal degenerative disease, or some other progressive process will be revealed by a history of deterioration in skills previously acquired. The diagnosis can then be established by other characteristic signs of the condition under consideration and appropriate laboratory studies. Grand mal, focal seizures and minor motor seizures are the types usually encountered in infancy. The same factors which commonly cause seizures in infancy continue to initiate seizures in childhood and early adolescence, but to a steadily decreasing extent. Thus, seizures due to a birth injury, like most post-traumatic seizures, usually begin within 24 months after the traumatic incident1; however, they may be delayed until late childhood or adolescence. Seizures appearing as a sequela of meningitis or other infections are sometimes similarly delayed. After the second year of life, seizures of unknown cause rapidly increase in incidence, including cases of so-called genetic epilepsy. In the latter, centrencephalic seizure bursts (3/sec wave and spike discharges) appear diffusely in the EEG, not only in patients, but in 45% of their asymptomatic siblings (aged 4 to 16 years), as well.",

Chronic pain is a common symptom in older people presenting to health services in both primary and secondary care. The key issue in assessment, as in many other chronic medical conditions, is having a high index of suspicion for depression in patients with Parkinson's disease. Patients with Parkinson's disease and depression will obviously have many of the social difficulties common to many older people and assessments of their needs should include finances, housing, aids and adaptations required and opportunities for social interaction and availability of practical support and care.",

      "abstract": "Disturbances of respiration during the acute stage of epidemic encephalitis are common and include respiratory paralysis, tachypnea, bradypnea and various types of irregularity of rate or amplitude. They may be due to inflammatory changes in the respiratory organs, to bulbar lesions or to myoclonic contractions of respiratory muscles. Less commonly among the sequelae, or in what we now regard as the chronic stage of the disease, similar disturbances occur. These phenomena were classified by Marie1into (1) disturbances of respiration proper, as tachypnea (either permanent or paroxysmal with periods of apnea), and bradypnea; (2) spasmodic cough, and (3) respiratory tics. They may be associated with other disturbances, such as the pseudo-Parkinson syndrome, or may be the predominating symptom. The most striking of these disturbances are attacks of alternate polypnea and apnea, which seem to be characteristic of this disease. Such cases have been reported by Vincent and Bernard,2",

      "title": "Neural circuits underlying motor and non-motor defects of Parkinson’s disease",
      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that causes unintended and uncontrollable movements, such as tremors, rigidity, and difficulty with balance and coordination. Neuronal degeneration in the basal ganglia network has been suggested as a likely cause for some PD symptoms. More specifically, such degeneration would lead to an imbalance between the direct pathway (from striatum to substantia nigra) and the indirect pathway (from striatum to pallidum), which subsequently drives movement deficits.1McGregor M.M. Nelson A.B. Circuit mechanisms of Parkinson's disease.Neuron. 2019; 101: 1042-1056Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (208) Google Scholar Current treatments for the motor dysfunction of PD include dopamine agonists, deep brain stimulation (DBS), and physical therapy. Aside from severe motor impairments, PD patients can also experience defects in cognitive processes such as memory and attention and suffer from depression or stress. However, the neural circuit basis for these different PD symptoms is not well understood. Improving our understanding of these non-motor PD symptoms could lead to the identification of novel therapeutic approaches for their treatment in the future. The parafascicular thalamic nucleus (PF) is located in the caudal region of the intralaminar thalamic complex and projects to the subthalamic nucleus (STN), caudate putamen (CPu), and nucleus accumbens (NAc), among other regions. Based on the knowledge that both STN and CPu have been linked to PD defects, that NAc activity is correlated with reward/depression, and that DBS targeting PF alleviates some pathophysiological changes, Zhang and colleagues systematically investigated the function of these PF circuits in mice and published their findings in Nature recently.2Zhang Y. Roy D.S. Zhu Y. et al.Targeting thalamic circuits rescues motor and mood deficits in PD mice.Nature. 2022; 607: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar In this study, the authors clarified the function of three different subpopulations of PF neurons in locomotion, motor learning, and depression-like states in PD mice, and they demonstrated that regulating specific nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) expressed in PF neurons and their projections was sufficient to rescue both motor and non-motor defects in PD mice (Figure 1). PF has extensive connectivity with the basal ganglia network. A recent study dissecting cortical-thalamic-striatal circuits suggests PF neurons are anatomically and transcriptionally organized.3Mandelbaum G. Taranda J. Haynes T.M. et al.Distinct cortical-thalamic-striatal circuits through the parafascicular nucleus.Neuron. 2019; 102: 636-652.e7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar The authors first investigated whether PF contains subpopulations based on their projections to three different brain regions. They found projections from PF thalamus to CPu, STN, and NAc, as expected. Retrogradely labeled PF neurons from CPu or STN (PF→CPu or PF→STN) were intermingled in lateral PF, whereas NAc-projecting PF neurons (PF→NAc) were restricted to medial PF. These three PF subpopulations showed minimal overlap, suggesting the existence of at least three distinct projection-specific circuits. Based on these anatomical data and additional electrophysiological differences, the authors hypothesized that the functions of these PF subpopulations might be different. By manipulating individual PF subpopulations in wild-type mice, the authors found that CPu-projecting PF neurons contributed to general motor activity (i.e., locomotion), whereas the PF→STN circuit was critical for motor learning. These findings revealed differential functions of PF subpopulations located in the lateral region of this nucleus. In contrast, the PF→NAc circuit was found to be associated with a depression-like state but not locomotion or motor learning processes. Importantly, when the authors examined these three PF circuits in an acute PD model, they found that each circuit showed an alteration in its strength or plasticity, indicating that these circuits are not only critical for physiological functions but are also targeted in this disease model. Although the above findings provided potential targets for developing DBS-based strategies, it is critical to find out if there was a molecular target-based alternative for treating motor and non-motor PD symptoms. The best-known treatment options for PD are levodopa and monoamine oxidase type B inhibitors, which mostly help with locomotion. Motor learning and non-motor symptoms, on the other hand, have fewer treating options. The authors identified an α7 nAChR agonist, PNU282987, which significantly improved motor learning through parvalbumin (PV+) STN neurons. Further, an α6 nAChR antagonist targeting CPu-projecting PF neurons rescued locomotion deficits, and a β2 nAChR agonist acting on D1+ NAc neurons alleviated depression-like behaviors in PD mice. Notably, the authors found that the identified molecular targets expressed in mouse PF can also be found in non-human primates (NHPs). They found that α7 nAChRs were highly expressed in PV+ STN neurons, α6 nAChRs were expressed in PF cell bodies, and β2 nAChRs were highly expressed in D1+ NAc neurons in NHPs. As NHPs are closely related to humans, these findings suggest that targeting different nAChRs in PF circuits may alleviate both motor and non-motor deficits in PD. Another message from both Feng group and Sabatini group is that subpopulations and their projections play unique roles in PF circuitry.2Zhang Y. Roy D.S. Zhu Y. et al.Targeting thalamic circuits rescues motor and mood deficits in PD mice.Nature. 2022; 607: 321-329Crossref PubMed Scopus (17) Google Scholar,3Mandelbaum G. Taranda J.

McEwen S. et al.Exercise-enhanced neuroplasticity targeting motor and cognitive circuitry in Parkinson's disease.Lancet Neurol. 2013; 12: 716-726Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (463) Google Scholar Combining single-cell sequencing technologies with neural tracing and electrophysiology recording to precisely dissect regional/subregional markers and their unique connectivity offers an exciting direction for future studies, which will not only strengthen our understanding of brain networks in health and disease conditions, but can also help identify cell type- and projection-specific therapeutic approaches. Furthermore, given the PF-striatal projections were found to be topographically organized with unique molecular architecture and electrophysiological properties,3Mandelbaum G. Taranda J. Haynes T.M. et al.Distinct cortical-thalamic-striatal circuits through the parafascicular nucleus.Neuron. 2019; 102: 636-652.e7Abstract Full Text Full Text PDF PubMed Scopus (77) Google Scholar Zhang et al. indicated CPu projection was associated with general motor defects in PD. It is intriguing to explore whether heterogeneous populations in PF-striatal projections have distinct functions in PD. Another foreseeable challenge is the therapeutic method. Following the finding that regulating different nAChRs improves motor or non-motor symptoms in PD, it remains challenging to develop an all-in-one treatment. Given that the NHP model has a higher translational potential, the current study pointed out the importance of studying PF circuits and testing molecular target candidates using NHP PD models, which could speed up the clinical applications of this work. Realistically speaking there is a long way to go for the current study to directly benefit patients with PD. As a proof-of-concept study, the findings need to undergo verification in NHPs before an initial preclinical test,5Dai J. Gaining a better understanding of nonhuman primate research.Sci. Bull. 2021; 66: 1499-1501Crossref Scopus (1) Google Scholar which may take years before an official clinical trial gets approval. In addition to neural circuit-based strategies, other candidate therapeutic approaches are being developed in parallel with the hope of treating PD patients in the future. For instance, converting astrocytes to dopamine neurons using gene-editing technology has recently been reported in rodents. Therefore, there is reason to be hopeful that with the development of cutting-edge experimental techniques our understanding of PD mechanisms will improve and in this way lead to novel therapeutic approaches.

Una cuestion que esta sin resolver es la determinacion de los cambios dependientes del vs rasgo, es decir, si existen diferencias entre los episodios maniacos y depresivos, y hasta que punto los cambios observados persisten en eutimia. Ademas, los estudios hasta la fecha se han centrado principalmente en el estudio de las activaciones, y poco se sabe acerca de los cambios en la desactivacion. Dado que los cambios funcionales cerebrales en eutimia no estan directamente relacionados con los sintomas agudos de la mania o depresion, parece probable que reflejen otros aspectos del trastorno. Una posibilidad es que reflejen la vulnerabilidad a la enfermedad y, dado que uno de los principales factores de riesgo es la genetica, se plantea la cuestion de si los cambios cerebrales funcionales en eutimia tambien se puedan detectar en los familiares de pacientes que no han desarrollado el trastorno. Por otro lado, es posible que el deterioro cognitivo presente en eutimia se relacione con los cambios funcionales y/o estructurales cerebrales encontrados, pero hasta la fecha los resultados han sido inconsistentes.\nEl objetivo de este trabajo es, por tanto, examinar los cambios en el funcionamiento cerebral en cada una de las tres fases del trastorno bipolar; determinar que cambios en el funcionamiento cerebral estan presentes en familiares sanos de primer grado de los pacientes; y determinar si, y en que medida, el deterioro cognitivo en pacientes eutimicos se asocia con cambios cerebrales funcionales y/o estructurales.\n Nuestros resultados indican que los cambios funcionales cerebrales en el trastorno bipolar se pueden dividir en aquellos que estan relacionados con el estado y los que son marcadores rasgo. La corteza parietal mostro evidencia de pertenecer a la primera categoria mientras que la corteza prefrontal dorsolateral mostro una combinacion de ambas caracteristicas: exhibe una activacion reducida en ambas fases agudas de la enfermedad, pero sin normalizarse completamente en la eutimia. El fallo en la desactivacion en la corteza frontal medial, correspondiente con el nodo anterior de la red neuronal por defecto, mostro una clara evidencia de ser un marcador rasgo para el trastorno. Esta alteracion, se observo igualmente, pero de forma menos marcada, en los hermanos no afectados. Sin embargo, su disfuncion no parece ser responsable del deterioro cognitivo presente en el trastorno, que en cambio si que se relaciona con una activacion reducida en la corteza prefrontal dorsolateral derecha.\nEn conclusion, estos resultados ponen de relieve la implicacion de la red neuronal por defecto en el trastorno bipolar. Sin embargo, la naturaleza de esta disfuncion y su relacion con la sintomatologia de este trastorno es aun desconocida.",

      "title": "Genetic Imaging of Neuroinflammation in Parkinson’s Disease: Recent Advancements",
      "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease (PD) is one of the most prevalent neurodegenerative aging disorders characterized by motor and non-motor symptoms due to the selective loss of midbrain dopaminergic (DA) neurons. The decreased viability of DA neurons slowly results in the appearance of motor symptoms such as rigidity, bradykinesia, resting tremor, and postural instability. These symptoms largely depend on DA nigrostriatal denervation. Pharmacological and surgical interventions are the main treatment for improving clinical symptoms, but it has not been possible to cure PD. Furthermore, the cause of neurodegeneration remains unclear. One of the possible neurodegeneration mechanisms is a chronic inflammation of the central nervous system, which is mediated by microglial cells. Impaired or dead DA neurons can directly lead to microglia activation, producing a large number of reactive oxygen species and pro-inflammatory cytokines. These cytotoxic factors contribute to the apoptosis and death of DA neurons, and the pathological process of neuroinflammation aggravates the primary morbid process and exacerbates ongoing neurodegeneration. Therefore, anti-inflammatory treatment exerts a robust neuroprotective effect in a mouse model of PD. Since discovering the first mutation in the α-synuclein gene (SNCA), which can cause disease-causing, PD has involved many genes and loci such as LRRK2, Parkin, SNCA, and PINK1. In this article, we summarize the critical descriptions of the genetic factors involved in PD’s occurrence and development (such as LRRK2, SNCA, Parkin, PINK1, and inflammasome), and these factors play a crucial role in neuroinflammation. Regulation of these signaling pathways and molecular factors related to these genetic factors can vastly improve the neuroinflammation of PD.",

      "title": "Good practice in the assessment and management of nocturnal Parkinson’s disease symptoms",
      "abstract": "The disability associated with Parkinson’s disease (PD) is classically attributed to a range of motor symptoms, but people with PD also experience non-motor symptoms, ranging from cognitive and psychiatric problems including depression, apathy and anxiety, to sleep disorders, nocturia, sexual dysfunction, and faecal and urinary incontinence. Individuals have different experiences of PD, but in a recent survey of patients attending a UK PD clinic, sleep disturbance was the second most common non-motor symptom reported after balance problems [1]. Other studies have reported that 67–98% of patients are affected by sleeprelated problems and that these become increasingly prevalent as the disease progresses [2]. People with PD experience a wide range of sleeprelated symptoms, but in a recent pilot survey of members of the UK Parkinson’s Disease Society, 41% of patients reported tiredness, fatigue and a lack of energy, while 30% said that they experienced frequent waking during the night and difficulty in sleeping, falling asleep and manoeuvring in bed [3]. Although advancing disease and the adverse effects of some drug treatments are contributory factors, disruption of nocturnal sleep is undoubtedly an important cause of excessive daytime sleepiness, which can be objectively verified in half the patients included in sleep laboratory studies [4]. Obstructive sleep apnoea syndromes are a common and treatable cause of disrupted sleep and daytime sleepiness in the elderly PD population [5]. Sleepiness during the day results in impaired quality of life, and may be associated with cardiovascular risk [6], dementia or cognitive impairment [7], and an increased risk of accidents [8]. Conversely, studies of treatments designed to alleviate nocturnal symptoms have reported improvements in clinical global state, as well as reduction in painful dyskinesias, dystonia and nocturnal akinesia [9]. Improvement in nocturnal symptoms also has the potential to reduce caregiver burden, since sleep disturbance among PD patients commonly has a negative impact on the sleep of their spouses. Indeed, the impact of specific effects of PD on sleep may be at least as profound on the spouses as on the patients themselves. In one study of caregivers, sleep disturbance was reported by 90%, poor subjective sleep quality by 65% and sleep latency by 55%. Daytime dysfunction was also reported by 80%, though this was generally due to ‘reduced enthusiasm’ rather than actual difficulty in staying awake (80% versus 5%) [10]. Two types of sleep disturbance have been reported among PD spouses: the first is associated with awakening during the night to help the patient and is predicted by the disease severity and the patient’s sleep disturbance, while the second is predicted by the spouse’s own level of stress and depression [11]. The negative impact of PD-related sleep disturbance on both patients and their family caregivers warrants aggressive intervention, but the approach to treatment will be influenced by the aetiology of the symptoms in each patient.",

In a fairly large group of cases, the convulsion is but a symptom of an unstable nervous system, one that is unable to withstand the ordinary vicissitudes to which the normal child is subjected. 5. There is undoubtedly a fairly large group of convulsive disorders in childhood where the convulsions are symptoms of an undiagnosed meningitis or encephalitis, which leaves behind irreparable damage to the nervous system. 6. The convulsion itself, though not associated with any devastating disease, such as meningitis, or encephalitis, may produce damage from which the brain never recovers, as seen in: (a) Some of the spastic conditions which follow immediately upon a series of convulsions. (b) Those cases following convulsions without neurological signs, but which have to adjust on a very much lower mental level. 7. The convulsions associated with rickets and tetany may leave behind very definite damage to the nervous system. 8.

      "abstract": "La maladie de Parkinson est une pathologie neurologique frequente, notamment apres 60 ans, dont la specificite est la presence de symptomes moteurs et non-moteurs. Des les premieres annees d'evolution on peut objectiver des troubles cognitifs. Le Mild Cognitive Impairement (MCI) est defini comme un etat cognitif situe entre l'absence de trouble et la demence. La MDS Task Force recommande la prise en compte de la plainte cognitive subjective des patients dans le diagnostic de MCI. Il a ete demontre que la plainte cognitive subjective est presente precocement dans la maladie de Parkinson de maniere reproductible et dans plusieurs domaines cognitifs.\r\nNous avons mesure l'evolution de la plainte cognitive subjective en utilisant une echelle visuelle analogique (EVA) multidomaine. Pour cela, nous avons suivi pendant 4 ans une cohorte de 49 patients parkinsoniens et avons evalue la plainte cognitive subjective et le statut cognitif grâce a des tests neuropsychologiques pour 5 domaines cognitifs : memoire, fonctions executives, fonctions visuo-spatiales, attention et langage.\r\nNos resultats montrent une correlation significative entre la plainte cognitive precoce et tardive dans 4 domaines cognitifs : memoire, fonctions executives, attention et langage. Il existe plusieurs parametres influencant la plainte cognitive subjective et une degradation de l'etat cognitif objectif dans notre cohorte principalement dans le domaine de l'attention.\r\nLa plainte cognitive subjective represente la partie emergee de l'iceberg, c'est-a-dire qu'elle precede de plusieurs annees l'apparition de troubles cognitifs objectifs dans la maladie de Parkinson. Il apparait necessaire de prendre en compte la plainte subjective des patients des le debut et lors du suivi.",

      "title": "Depression and Cognitive Impairment in Parkinson's Disease: A Role for Inflammation and Immunomodulation?",
      "abstract": "The etiology of Parkinson's disease (PD) is complex and not fully understood, most probably because of the multiplicity of factors involved. Inflammatory and abnormal immune responses have been hypothesized to play a crucial role in PD. Not only in the brain, but also peripherally, inflammation is believed to contribute to the onset and progression of the neurodegenerative process seen in PD. Furthermore, increased inflammatory responses have been described both in the brain and peripheral blood of PD subjects. Although PD is considered a motor disorder, nonmotor symptoms are extremely frequent and disabling. Cognitive impairment and mood alterations are such symptoms that deserve increased attention since on the one hand they can appear even before typical motor disturbances are recognized, and on the other hand they are associated with high morbidity and mortality. A growing body of evidence suggests the existence of a link between inflammatory-immune responses and the occurrence of depression and cognitive impairment in PD patients. However, not all data are equally conclusive and are sometimes even conflicting. The aim of this brief review is to give an overview of the possible role that inflammation and immunomodulation may play in PD together with their putative impact on mood and cognitive alterations. What clearly emerges from this work is the fact that studies performed until now lack standardized and comparable methods to analyze both clinical and biological parameters. It is thus difficult to conclusively link mood and cognitive changes to underlying pathological mechanisms. Additional studies in this direction are warranted to convincingly establish or refute any causative relation.",

      "abstract": "Auteur(s) : Christian Derouesne La troisieme conference internationale sur la demence a corps de Lewy (DCL) [1] reconnait les difficultes du diagnostic liees a la faible sensibilite des criteres utilises. Deux elements y concourent : la difficile appreciation des fluctuations cognitives, elements cles du diagnostic, et de la faible frequence de conjonction des trois criteres principaux qui semble liee a la presence d’une pathologie de type Alzheimer associee. Les criteres proposes pour un diagnostic de DCL probable sont : 1) la presence des trois signes majeurs : fluctuations cognitives avec des variations prononcees de l’attention et de la vigilance ; hallucinations visuelles recurrentes et detaillees ; presence de signes parkinsoniens spontanes ; 2) la presence de 1 ou plus des signes majeurs s’il existe 1 ou plus signes suggestifs. Le diagnostic de DCL possible peut etre porte chez un sujet dement, en l’absence de signes majeurs, devant 1 ou plus des signes suggestifs suivants : 1) troubles du sommeil paradoxal que traduit une agitation nocturne (les patients « agissent leurs reves ») ; 2) severe sensibilite aux neuroleptiques ; 3) mise en evidence d’un deficit dopaminergique dans les noyaux gris par la tomoscinigraphie. D’autres signes sont communs mais manquent de specificite : 1) signes de dysautonomie : hypotension orthostatique, chutes ou syncopes, instabilite neurocardiovasculaire, incontinence urinaire, impuissance, constipation ; 2) delire systematise ; 3) hallucinations autres que visuelles ; 4) depression ; 5) relative preservation des structures temporales internes en IRM ; 6) ralentissement diffus a l’EEG ; 7) hypoperfusion cerebrale generalisee, notamment dans les regions occipitales. Au plan neuropsychologique, la differenciation avec la MA repose sur une double dissociation : dans la DCL, la preservation relative de la denomination, du rappel a court et moyen terme comme de la reconnaissance contraste avec l’alteration de la fluence verbale, de la perception visuelle et des performances visuospatiales. Pour diminuer les difficultes d’appreciation des fluctuations, les auteurs recommandent d’utiliser les echelles de fluctuations cognitives proposees par Walker et al. [2] (la Clinician assessment of fluctuation scale necessite toutefois une plus grande expertise que la One day fluctuation assessement scale) ou la Mayo fluctuations composite scale pour differencier les fluctuations de la DCL de celles qui sont observees dans la MA [3]. Les criteres histopathologiques sont precises, notamment la quantification des lesions de type Alzheimer. L’article se conclut sur l’interet d’un traitement combine par les inhibiteurs de la cholinesterase et les dopaminergiques [4]. Quant a la question des rapports entre demence parkinsonienne (definie par l’apparition d’une demence chez un parkinsonien de longue date) et la DC (dans laquelle les signes parkinsoniens ne doivent pas avoir precede la demence de plus de 1 an), le consortium considere que cette distinction doit etre maintenue pour des raisons cliniques, mais qu’au niveau de la recherche, clinicopathologique ou therapeutique, les deux phenotypes peuvent etre reunis sous le terme de maladie a corps de Lewy ou alpha-synucleinopathie ! 1. McKeith IG, Dickson DW, Lowe J, Emre M, O’Brien JT, Feldman H, et al.

Besides a central feature, dementia, and core features including parkinsonism, fluctuating cognition, and recurrent visual hallucinations, the patients presented some of supportive features, that is, repeated falls (4 cases), syncope (5 cases), and transient loss of consciousness (all cases). Autopsy, which was performed in 2 of the cases, revealed Lewy bodies in various nervous tissues including autonomic nervous systems in both cases. 7 cases of probable DLBD and 8 cases of possible DLBD, which lacked fluctuating cognition and/or visual hallucinations, demonstrated neither of repeated falls, syncope, nor transient loss of consciousness. Episodes of these supportive features, which seem to be associated with autonomic dysfunctions and/or fluctuating cognition, should be important in the differential diagnosis of DLBD.",

      "title": "Molecular Basis of Diseases of the Nervous System",
      "abstract": "The central nervous system (CNS) is composed of cellular components organized in a complex structure that is unlike other organ systems. At the macroscopic level, the parenchyma of the CNS can be categorized into two structurally and functionally unique components: gray and white matter. The CNS can be divided into a number of anatomic regions, each with specific neurologic or cognitive functions. Disease or damage to these regions produces neurologic or cognitive deficits that correlate with the anatomic location and extent of disease. There are several ways to divide these structures. The main divisions are the cerebrum, cerebellum, brainstem, and spinal cord. Developmental neuropathology encompasses a broad variety of cerebral malformations and functional impairments caused by disturbances of brain development, manifesting during ages from the embryonic period through adolescence and young adulthood. The neurologic and psychiatric manifestations of neurodevelopmental disorders range widely depending on the affected neural systems and include such diverse manifestations as epilepsy, mental retardation, cerebral palsy, breathing disorders, ataxia, autism, and schizophrenia. In terms of morbidity and mortality, the spectrum is extremely broad: the mildest neurodevelopmental disorders can be asymptomatic, whereas the worst malformations often lead to intrauterine or neonatal demise. This chapter focuses on the genetic disorders of brain development, caused by mutations of gene loci or chromosomal regions with important neurodevelopmental functions.",

It is characterized by a tremor accompanying muscle activity, and interesting, when complete, the two upper limbs, the head and the voice, with variable degree of severity. Its progression is very slow. The diagnostic criteria are only clinical, but require ruling out iatrogenic and metabolic causes. 2) Tremor in Parkinson's disease is opposed point by point to essential tremor. However, confusion may occur due to some intermediate clinical situations. In these cases, pharmacology or DaTSCAN data can help to distinguish between the two conditions. 3) Other causes are considered, giving the priority to practical and therapeutic aspects. The psychological consequences of tremor should be taken into account to improve the quality of life of patients with tremor. Terms which stigmatize, such as senile tremor, or terms which minimize the relational and social consequences of tremor, such as benign tremor, should be discarded.",

Presently, the motor and non-motor symptoms are difficult to treat with the current treatment of Parkinson's; therefore, as an adjuvant to the current treatment physical activity, has been recommended. Physical activity has been known to improve many symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease. Some of these symptoms include the physical capacities, physical and cognitive functional capacities. Physical activity also slows the disease process, decreases the pain associated with Parkinson`s disease, prolongs the independent mobility (gait, balance, strength) and improves sleep, mood, memory hence improving the overall quality of life. Furthermore, physical activity has the potential to improve the non-motor symptoms (depression, apathy, fatigue, constipation) and the secondary complications of immobility (cardiovascular, osteoporosis) in Parkinson's disease.",

Die Ausprägung des Vollbildes mit Hyperthermie, Hyperhidrosis, Verwirrtheit, Rigidität, autonomer Dysregulation sowie gesteigerter Kreatininkinase zeigt eine Inzidenz zwischen 0,02 und 2,4%. Milde subsyndromale Verlaufsformen sollen in der Inzidenz um 12% liegen [3]. Oft ist die differenzialdiagnostische Unterscheidung von MNS und febriler Katatonie schwierig. Die perniziöse oder febrile Katatonie gilt als Sonderform der katatonen Schizophrenie. Aufgrund erheblicher Überschneidungen in der Symptomatik (Hyperthermie, Bewusstseinsstörungen, Stupor und autonome Dysregulationen bei beiden Syndromen) spricht man auch vom \"katatonen Dilemma\". Diagnostische Unterschiede lassen sich, wenn überhaupt, am Anfang der Symptomatik herausarbeiten. So beginnt die perniziöse Katatonie mit typischen schizophrenen Symptomen. Ein MNS entwickelt sich dagegen meist innerhalb von 1–2 Wochen nach Beginn der Neuroleptikatherapie, wenn die psychotische Symptomatik häufig bereits abgeschwächt ist. Bei der perniziösen Katatonie findet sich typischerweise eine ausgeprägte extrapyramidale Symptomatik mit Rigor, Akinese, aber auch Dys- und Hyperkinesen sowie Stupor [1,2,4].",

      "abstract": "Psychotic symptoms have become increasingly common in patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease and other parkinsonian syndromes. This increased prevalence of psychoses is in part a reflection of the greater longevity of people with Parkinson's disease and, to a certain extent, is a consequence of our success in treating the motor symptoms of these syndromes. The psychotic symptoms associated with Parkinson's disease can be as varied as the motor symptoms. They stem from interactions between the underlying neuropathologies of the syndromes and the adverse effects associated with chronic antiparkinsonian drug administration. In patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, there is also a high prevalence of affective comorbidity. This increase in affective symptoms and the relatively high incidence of cognitive and affective side effects of the antiparkinsonian medications contribute to the increase in psychoses observed in these older patients. The most significant risk factors for developing psychosis in Parkinson's disease are (1) coexistence of dementia, (2) protracted sleep disturbances, and (3) nighttime use of long-acting dopaminomimetics. This article reviews the phenomenology, pathophysiology, and treatment of psychosis associated with parkinsonism and discusses how atypical antipsychotic medications have revolutionized the management of the symptoms and improved the quality of life of those affected.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders refer to a spectrum of conditions that interfere with regular sleep patterns. One of the most frequently reported clinical issues is sleep disturbance. Physiological, neurological, social, and mental well-being can be critically affected by insufficient or non-restorative sleep. Overall, health and quality of life can be impacted by sleep disorders. Mental health and sleep share a significant relationship. It has long been acknowledged that individuals with mental health disorders frequently experience sleep issues. The predominant theory has been that sleep issues are basically signs of the psychiatric disorders that they are interrelated with. The fact that sleep issues are defining characteristics of a number of psychiatric disorders and are included in the diagnostic criteria for these conditions supports this aspect. However, sleep and mental health problems are associated further in diverse ways. Emerging research evidence suggests that the relationship between mental health problems and sleep disorders is complex and includes bi-directional causation, in contrast to the long-held view of this relationship that considered sleep issues as symptoms of psychiatric disorders. An increased prevalence of mental/psychiatric disorders, including anxiety and depression, among certain others, is reported among patients with insomnia, sleep-disordered breathing, and narcolepsy, suggesting sleep disorders as a risk factor for mental health disorders. Although much has been established about the relationship between impaired mental health and sleep, further research is required to elaborately comprehend this relationship. The purpose of this research is to review the available information about the relationship between sleep disorders and mental health.",

      "abstract": "Although neuropathies in the athlete's foot, ankle, and leg are uncommon, they are often underdiagnosed, primarily because of the complex interplay of causative factors. The physician should be aware of the possible occurrence of these neuropathies, and should be familiar with the anatomy and course of the nerves. Often, the problem only occurs during functional activity and cannot be demonstrated during the routine static examination. Other problems should also be considered when there is the possibility of a nerve compression syndrome. Metabolic processes, such as diabetes or abuse of alcohol, can certainly cause neuropathies. A double crush syndrome or pain from a higher source should also be considered. Finally, if surgery is done for chronic problems, only the area of constriction should be released, without interfering with the nerve itself. Release the fascia but leave the perineural fat intact. If instability is a factor, the joint should also be stabilized.",

      "abstract": "El síndrome depresivo anhedónico secundario a disfunción metabólica cerebral constituye una entidad clínica emergente que, pese a no estar formalmente reconocida en los manuales diagnósticos (DSM-5, CIE-11), se perfila como un subtipo de depresión de alta relevancia en la intersección entre psiquiatría biológica, neurociencias y medicina metabólica. Su rasgo cardinal, la anhedonia, se vincula con alteraciones en la neurotransmisión dopaminérgica, desbalances energéticos neuronales y procesos neuroinflamatorios.Este trabajo describe la evolución natural del síndrome cuando no recibe diagnóstico ni intervención: desde la fase inicial con apatía fluctuante (0–6 meses), pasando por depresión persistente (6–18 meses), hasta la cronificación con deterioro funcional (2–3 años) y finalmente la progresión a cuadros de neurodegeneración y riesgo vital por suicidio (5–10 años). Con base en evidencia epidemiológica mexicana, se estima que entre 2–5% de la población adulta podría encajar en este fenotipo, aunque gran parte permanece infradiagnosticada y se autogestiona con conductas compensatorias de alto riesgo (consumo de azúcares, alcohol, nicotina).Se discuten los factores aceleradores (variabilidad glucémica, insomnio, sedentarismo, dieta proinflamatoria) y moduladores protectores (actividad física estructurada, dieta antiinflamatoria, higiene del sueño, reducción de azúcares), así como la urgencia de protocolos integrativos que permitan diferenciar esta condición de otros cuadros psiquiátricos tradicionales.El presente análisis busca aportar al reconocimiento clínico y científico de un síndrome que, de no ser visibilizado, condena a miles de pacientes a diagnósticos erróneos, tratamientos ineficaces y al deterioro progresivo de su salud física, mental y social.",

India, along with its demographic shift and its overwhelming population growth, falls a victim to all old-age degenerative diseases. A large percentage of the elderly Indian population today suffers from Parkinsonian and related disorders. Disturbed cognition and neurobehavioral abnormalities are enough reasons for a falling ADL (activities of daily living) curve, and consequent distress to families of PD patients.

Extensive research the last 10 years has provided new knowledge in the field.This review is based on literature retrieved from a Medline search and own research and clinical experience.Neuropsychiatric symptoms occur in the majority of patients with Parkinson's disease, and are associated with impaired quality of life for patients and relatives, additional deterioration of function and increased use of health resources. Medical and surgical therapies can induce or worsen such symptoms. Cognitive impairment and dementia are among the most common and severe complications to Parkinson's disease. No disease-modifying treatment is available, but rivastigmine was effective in one large randomised trial. Visual hallucinations are common and often persistent, but can be treated with klozapin if reducing the number and dose of antiparkinson agents are not helpful. Depression occurs frequently, usually mild, but there is little evidence of treatment efficacy. Apathy, anxiety and sleep disturbances are additional commonly occurring neuropsychiatric symptoms. Neuropsychiatric symptoms are so frequent in Parkinson's disease that they should be considered an integral part of the disease; it is important that clinicians are aware of these symptoms.",

      "title": "Relapsing–remitting and primary progressive MS have the same cause(s)- the neuropathologist’s view: 2",
      "abstract": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a heterogeneous disease with respect to clinical symptoms, neuroradiological findings and treatment responses. The obvious differences in disease courses between patients led to the classification of MS as either relapsing–remitting (RRMS), secondary progressive (SPMS) or primary progressive MS (PPMS). The majority of patients starts with a relapsing–remitting disease course characterized by acute exacerbation followed by partial or total recovery; whereas PPMS is associated with a continuous worsening of symptoms and is only observed in about 10–15% of the patients. However, even the clinical presentation does not always allow clear separation between RRMS or PPMS, since some MS patients start with a progressive disease course after a single or few relapses or suffer from a progressive disease from the beginning superimposed by few relapses. The subsequent rate of disease progression is comparable in SPMS and PPMS and is not affected by relapses as soon as a certain Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score is reached. 1 Only about 50% of siblings with MS show an identical disease course. The recently identified susceptibility genes, each of which each contributes less than 1% of disease risk, are comparably distributed in RRMS and PPMS. 2 These epidemiological findings suggest that the different disease courses represent different ends of a disease spectrum rather than different diseases or disease etiologies. This point of view is supported by histopathological and imaging studies that describe quantitative rather than qualitative differences between different clinical courses. Although no fundamental differences have been identified between patients with either RRMS/SPMS or PPMS, this does not mean that the same pathomechansims are responsible for clinical symptoms in all MS patients. The histopathological hallmarks of MS change with disease duration. Whereas the development of new focal inflammatory demyelinating lesions in grey and white matter dominate the pathology at the beginning of the disease, the progressive disease phase is characterized by diffuse white matter abnormalities, accumulation of axonal loss in demyelinated as well as normal-appearing white matter and limited remyelination. The relapses are believed to be the consequences of focal inflammatory lesions whereas recovery may be induced by resolution of inflammation and edema, increased plasticity and endogenous repair mechanisms such as remyelination. RRMS patients develop numerous contrastenhancing lesions which presumably represent actively demyelinating lesions and the number of newly developing lesions decrease with disease duration. 3 This point of view is supported by histological studies which demonstrate a higher number of actively demyelinating lesions in RRMS than in SPMS. Patients with PPMS also develop contrastenhancing lesions and this is associated with a more rapid progression of disease. 4 Not surprisingly, actively demyelinating lesions can also be found in patients with PPMS. 3 These highly inflammatory lesions, observed in the early disease stages, are heterogeneous with respect to composition of inflammation and extent of initial oligodendroglial cell death, suggesting that different pathomechanisms may lead to demyelination. However, these different histological patterns described by Lucchinetti et al. are not predictive for the clinical disease course. 5 Due to the accumulation of new lesions, the extent of demyelination increases with disease duration: histopathological and imaging studies show that patients with PPMS tend to have comparable lesion loads to RRMS or SPMS patients but that the lesions",

Like these types of epilepsy, MAE is polygenically determined with little non-genetic variability. The disease is characterized by the following criteria: genetic predisposition (high incidence of seizures and/or genetic EEG patterns in relatives); mostly normal development and no neurological deficits before onset; primarily generalized myoclonic, astatic or myoclonic-astatic seizures, short absences and mostly generalized tonic-clonic seizures; no tonic seizures or tonic drop attacks during daytime (except for some rare cases with a most unfavourable course); generalized EEG patterns (spikes and waves, photosensitivity, 4-7/sec rhythms), no multifocal EEG abnormalities (but often pseudofoci). There is a partial overlap with other 'syndromes', such as benign and severe myoclonic epilepsy in infants (Dravet et al., 1985a, b), myoclonic epilepsy of infancy and early childhood (Aicardi and others). In differential diagnosis the Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in its stricter sense has to be considered, and also atypical benign partial epilepsy or pseudo-Lennox syndrome. Discussion is presented of possible pitfalls in the classical syndromic approach to classifying epilepsies of early childhood, and of the advantages of a neurobiological view for understanding the immense variability of clinical manifestations of epilepsy.",

Hay pocos casos publicados de una lesión grave del nervio cubital asociada a una fractura cerrada del antebrazo. Presentamos dos casos clínicos de lesiones del nervio cubital consecuencia de una fractura cerrada de antebrazo. Un diagnóstico precoz y la detección de los signos clínicos de gravedad son fundamentales, ya que influyen directamente en la actitud a tomar y en el resultado del tratamiento. Los casos que se presentan, se trataron de forma quirúrgica y se encontraron lesiones nerviosas severas. Es difícil estandarizar el tratamiento, ya que existen distintas causas de lesión nerviosa y un rango amplio de gravedad. Tras analizar la mayoría de los casos publicados, la recomendación inicial es esperar la mejora espontánea de cuatro a seis meses. Si después de ese período, no hay mejoría de la sintomatología neurológica, está indicado realizar una exploración microquirúrgica del nervio. Se revisan algunos signos de gravedad que pueden indicar un tratamiento quirúrgico precoz.",

Parkinson’s disease (PD) symptoms and severity, however, differ from person to person. By extracting insights, trends, and possibilities from the data, data research can be utilized to uncover solutions to problems in medical research by utilizing data, machine learning algorithms, and cutting-edge technology. Among the less evident early signs of Parkinson's disease are tremors, muscle stiffness, imbalance problems, and difficulty walking. There is currently no test to detect the illness early on, when symptoms might not be evident. However, handwriting and hand- drawn subjects in humans have been linked to PD. In addition to being a useful tool for PD prediction, speech smearing functions as an early warning system. In order to control symptoms and maybe halt the disease's progression, early detection makes it possible to organize treatments and intervene promptly. For those with Parkinson's disease, early application of certain therapies and medications can extend survival and enhance quality of life.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The terms organic brain syndrome and dementia are applied to those acquired disorders of thinking and cognitive functions where altered structure or function of the brain can be identified. Generally, neurologists care for patients with these disorders. When no lesion or physiologic change is apparent, cognitive dysfunctions are often labeled functional or psychological disorders. Psychiatrists care for these patients. The inadequacy of this distinction is immediately apparent: any change in behavior must be the result of altered brain activity. In 1994 DSM-IV recognized this arbitrary distinction and did away with the division of behavior disorders into organic and nonorganic conditions. The section called “Organic Disorders” in previous DSM editions is called “Delirium, Dementia, and Amnestic and Other Cognitive Disorders” in DSM-IV; this category now stands alongside Affective, Anxiety, Schizophrenic Disorders, etc., removing any implication that there is one group of disorders related to the brain and another group that is just psychological (Tucker et al., 1994). To some degree, cognitive, affective, and behavioral symptoms characterize all disorders of the brain. There are cognitive disturbances in most of the major psychiatric disorders (see Chapters 3 and 5). However, the primary symptoms of delirium, dementia, and amnestic disorders are disturbances of cognition. Cognition comes from the Latin cognitio, which means to think.",

      "title": "Cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction in idiopathic Parkinson's disease",
      "abstract": "Cardiovascular dysautonomia is an integral part of Parkinson's disease (PD) and includes orthostatic hypotension, supine hypertension, nocturnal hypertension, labile blood pressure, and absence of decrease in blood pressure during night (non-dipping) and heart rate variability.[1] These can occur as an adverse effect of dopaminergic treatment as well as independent of drug effect. Cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction is not limited to advanced stages of PD and can occur even in the early mild stage of the disease.[2] Orthostatic hypotension affects 20–40% of PD patients. Cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction is associated with an increased risk of cognitive impairment, white matter hyperintensities, fatigue, falls, and mortality in patients with PD.[34] The pathophysiology involves the degeneration of both the peripheral autonomic nervous system as well as the involvement of central neural networks.[5] Lewy bodies have been demonstrated not only in central autonomic pathways but also in sympathetic ganglia and sacral plexus. Moreover, genetic factors also play a key role as cardiac sympathetic denervation has been observed in synuclein-alpha (SNCA) duplications and triplications and glucocerebrosidase (GBA) mutations.[6] Various assessment tools are available to assess cardiovascular dysautonomia such as Scale for outcomes in Parkinson's disease for autonomic symptoms (SCOPA-AUT), composite autonomic symptom scale, orthostatic grading scale, and novel non-motor symptoms scale.[7] The results of the study from Christian Medical College and Hospital, Ludhiana published with this commentary are consistent with the literature review.[8] Cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction was observed in two-thirds of the patients with impairment of both sympathetic and parasympathetic autonomic nervous systems. The authors highlighted the occurrence of dysautonomia even in the early stages of the disease and progressive worsening with age and disease severity. They also stressed the importance of blood pressure variability and abnormal dipping patterns on ambulatory blood pressure monitoring as a potential marker of dysautonomia. However, the authors have not studied the natural history of autonomic dysfunction in PD. Merola et al.[9] in their prospective cohort study of 131 PD patients found progression in the severity of orthostatic hypotension by 20% over 1 year with greater deterioration in activities of daily living and health care utilization. Cardiac imaging using iodine-123-metaiodobenzylguanidine (123I-MIBG) used to quantify postganglionic cardiac sympathetic innervation has a sensitivity and specificity of 90 and 83%, respectively, in differentiating PD from atypical parkinsonism.[10] Reduced cardiac 123I-MIBG uptake is associated with PD and is preserved in multiple system atrophy. However, 50% of de novo early-stage PD may show preserved cardiac sympathetic innervation and up to one-third of patients with multiple system atrophy have reduced cardiac tracer uptake.[1112] Treatment of neurogenic orthostatic hypotension includes correction of aggravating factors, non-pharmacological measures, and drug therapies. Fludrocortisone expands intravascular volume and midodrine and droxidopa increase blood pressure by increasing peripheral vascular resistance.[13] The effects of deep brain stimulation on cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction are controversial and undetermined at present with some studies showing benefits while others have demonstrated no modification or even adverse outcomes.[14] Novel neuroimaging techniques have highlighted the role of the medulla oblongata and the involvement of thalamo-striatal-hypothalamic connections as demonstrated with the help of diffusion tensor imaging and functional Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies.[1516] To conclude, cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction is an important non-motor symptom of PD that can occur across all the stages of the disease. The affection of both central and peripheral autonomic structures is responsible. Understanding its pathophysiological basis as well as the role of functional connectivity of brain regions involved in the complex process of autonomic integration will pave the way for the development of novel therapeutic approaches in the management of this disabling symptom.",

Treatment with potent immunosuppression resulted in remission of psychiatric illness. Due to a lack of awareness and/or the lack of specific biomarkers, clinicians may not associate psychiatric symptoms with autoimmune disease, including primary Sjogren's syndrome. This case demonstrates that Sjogren's syndrome may be a causative or aggravating factor in mental disorders and that autoimmune diseases should be carefully considered in the differential diagnosis of psychiatric illness especially in cases of concurrent physical symptomatology and severity or treatment resistance of psychiatric disease.",

      "abstract": "PARKINSON'S DISEASE (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder to affect older adults, after Alzheimer's disease. It is a chronic, progressive disorder, characterised by resting tremor, slowed movements, rigidity and postural instability. Between one and two per cent of the population over 65 has PD. With an ageing population, numbers of people with this condition are expected to rise, placing an increasing physical, psychological, social and economic burden on individuals, their families and caregivers, and the health-care system. Therapies for PD are palliative, treating symptoms without addressing underlying causes of the disease. Very little is known about the causative events in the development of PD, and the focus for management remains largely on gross motor symptoms. It is increasingly recognised, however, that PD involves degeneration of regions in the central nervous system (CNS) other than motor pathways, affecting mood, motivation and other functions, having a major impact on the quality of life for people with the disease. Providing care for people with PD requires a detailed understanding of the events occurring in the CNS as this conditions develops. Knowledge of the effects of PD on neurological function allows a better comprehension of the benefits and limitations of current therapies. It also allows informed assessment of more recent developments in PD research and treatment. Nurses with a good working knowledge of the current status of PD research and treatments are better able to support patients and their families on this long and difficult journey.",

      "abstract": "Diagnosis plays a key role in identification of a disease, learn about its course, management and predicting prognosis. In mental health, diseases are often complex and coalesce of different symptoms. Diagnosing a mental health condition requires careful evaluation of the symptoms and excluding other differential disorders that may share common symptoms. Diagnose hastily can lead to misdiagnosis. A premature diagnosis or misdiagnosis has clear negative consequences. This is one of the problems related to mental health and one needs to optimize the diagnostic process to achieve a balance between sensitivity and specificity. Currently, the diagnosis of bipolar disorder (BD) is one of the major mental health conditions that is often misdiagnosed. To differentiate BD from unipolar depression with recurrent episodes or with personality disorder (PD), especially type Cluster B – with features shared with mania/hypomania like mental instability or impulsivity, it is important to differentiate between a diagnosis and its comorbidity. BD is often misdiagnosed as personality disorder and vice versa specially when both are coexisting (almost 20% of patients with bipolar disorder type II are misdiagnosed as personality disorders). This is common especially with borderline PD, although in some cases the histrionic PD may also be misdiagnosed as mania. Due to the inconsistency in patient care involving different psychiatrists combined with difficulty in obtaining a precise patient history and family history leads to loss of key information which in turn leads to misdiagnosis of the condition. The time delay in making the correct diagnosis cause by such inconsistencies may worsen the prognosis of the disease in the patient.

The presence of postural tremor, which often occurs in PD, by itself is insufficient for the diagnosis of ET. Most epidemiological studies have shown that there is no association between these two conditions. Some studies, but not others have found a higher prevalence of tremor in family members of PD patients. Clinical, positron emission tomography scan, and neuropathological data have failed to show any relationship between these two conditions. It is concluded that there is no relationship between ET and PD and that when these two conditions are seen in the same patient, this represents a chance occurrence of two common diseases.",

Dopaminergic drugs act as aggravating or precipitating factor. Before the introduction of levodopa patients had described visual hallucinations but the frequency was below 5%. Objective Illustrated importance of treatment, reassessment after its introduction and refractoriness to answer; as well as the importance of a differential diagnosis at the onset of psychotic symptoms later in life. Method Clinical case: female patient 75 years tracking Neurology by parkinsonism in relation to possible early Parkinson disease. She was prescribed rasagiline treatment. Begins to present visual and auditory hallucinations, delusional self-referential and injury. She had no previous psychiatric history. She went on several occasions to the emergency room, where the anti-Parkinson treatment is decreased to the withdrawal point and scheduled antipsychotics did not answer. Doses of antipsychotics are increased despite which symptoms persist and even increase psychotic symptoms. In this situation it is agreed to extend the study. Subsequently an NMR of the skull where the image is suggestive of a right occipital meningioma appears. Results/conclusions With the emergence of psychotic symptoms later in life it will be important to ask a broad differential diagnosis, since in a large number of cases will be secondary to somatic or to drug therapies. Parkinsonism can be a symptom of occipital meningioma, presenting in the psychotic clinic. Refractoriness, on one hand to the suspension of treatment for Parkinson's disease, such as poor response to antipsychotics, did extend the study, which ultimately gave us the diagnosis.

The most severe form of GSD-II is the infantile-onset form, and was originally described by Dr. Pompe. These severely affected infants may appear normal at birth, but soon develop generalized muscle weakness and cardiac myopathy manifesting initially as a hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Shortly thereafter death resulting from cardiorespiratory failure typically occurs before the age of 2 years. The juvenile (onset as early as at age 1 year) or adult onset (onset between the second or later decades) forms of GSD-II present as slowly progressive limb muscle myopathies, and lack the cardiac involvement noted in the infantile patients. The clinical picture of these later onset forms of GSD-II are dominated by a slowly progressive respiratory muscle and proximal limb muscle weakness, with truncal involvement and greater involvement of the lower, rather than the upper limbs. Although these forms of GSD-II are not lethal in the neonatal period, juvenile and adult GSD-II patients suffer from significant morbidity and mortality, the latter primarily due to the complications of respiratory insufficiency.\r\n\r\nGSD-II is caused by the inheritance of mutant alleles that either result in the complete lack of expression of acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA) protein; this is the protein which breaks down intra-lysosomal glycogen. In general, the severity of the clinical phenotypes can be correlated with the residual GAA enzyme activity levels measured in a respective patient’s tissues. For example, infantile GSD-II patients typically have less than 1% of normal GAA activity levels in their muscles, while juvenile or adult onset forms of GSD-II may have 2-40% of normal GAA tissue activity levels. Infantile patients may have nonsense mutations that prevent any GAA protein from being expressed, or missense mutations that allow for production of an enzymatically “dead” GAA protein. Juvenile or adult onset GSD-II patients, have less severe mutations (missense or splice-site mutations) that cause expression of a less than nominal GAA protein, or decreased levels of a normal GAA protein. These facts alone demonstrate that very low levels of GAA activity allow for preservation of normal cardiac function in juvenile and adult GSD-II patients. However, in juvenile and adult onset patients, GAA activity levels generally cannot be positively correlated with rate of progression and/or disease severity of respiratory or limb muscle involvement, suggesting that other genes and/or environmental factors likely significantly impact on disease severity in juvenile or adult onset GSD-II patients. The true incidence of GSD-II (in all its presenting forms) is not accurately documented, but estimates are in the range of 1 in 40,000 to 1 in 100,000 live births. Due to the relatively rare occurrence of a GSD-II diagnosis, GSD-II has been designated an orphan disease.",

      "abstract": "Idiopathic REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) may be the initial manifestation of synucleinopathies (Parkinson disease [PD], multiple system atrophy [MSA], or dementia with Lewy bodies [DLB]).We used the Mayo medical records linkage system to identify cases presenting from 2002 to 2006 meeting the criteria of idiopathic RBD at onset, plus at least 15 years between RBD and development of other neurodegenerative symptoms. All patients underwent evaluations by specialists in sleep medicine to confirm RBD, and behavioral neurology or movement disorders to confirm the subsequent neurodegenerative syndrome.Clinical criteria were met by 27 patients who experienced isolated RBD for at least 15 years before evolving into PD, PD dementia (PDD), DLB, or MSA. The interval between RBD and subsequent neurologic syndrome ranged up to 50 years, with the median interval 25 years. At initial presentation, primary motor symptoms occurred in 13 patients: 9 with PD, 3 with PD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 1 with PDD. Primary cognitive symptoms occurred in 13 patients: 10 with probable DLB and 3 with MCI. One patient presented with primary autonomic symptoms, diagnosed as MSA. At most recent follow-up, 63% of patients progressed to develop dementia (PDD or DLB). Concomitant autonomic dysfunction was confirmed in 74% of all patients.These cases illustrate that the alpha-synuclein pathogenic process may start decades before the first symptoms of PD, DLB, or MSA. A long-duration preclinical phase has important implications for epidemiologic studies and future interventions designed to slow or halt the neurodegenerative process.",

The medication of dopamine, one of the most common treatment for the disease, has effects of improving the symptom, but when taken for a long term, the medicine brings about side-effects such as the phenomenon of medicinal efficacy disappearance and dyskinesia. In addition, it doesn't have any effects in slowing down or stopping the development of Parkinson's disease. Methods : Accordingly, this study aims to investigate the clinical cases to stop or improve the development of Parkinson's disease by carrying out an independent treatment with Oriental medicine and a combined treatment with Western and Oriental medicines respectively for over 6 months.

      "title": "Primera convulsión en apirexia",
      "abstract": "La informacion acerca de las caracteristicas del episodio critico generalmente es obtenida de un testigo casual, muchas veces un familiar, que vive el evento con mucha angustia y temor. Asimismo, los sucesivos interrogatorios pueden ir modificando el relato del episodio, afectando la calidad de la informacion obtenida. Por lo tanto, debe tenerse en cuenta la enorme importancia que tiene la realizacion de una historia clinica completa desde la primera consulta, en lo posible por un medico con conocimientos y experiencia clinica en el tema, y que la misma este orientada por el razonamiento clinico para poder formular los sucesivos diagnosticos en forma precisa. Cuando un nino tiene un episodio con manifestaciones clinicas que se inician y finalizan en forma mas o menos brusca, el mismo se clasifica como un evento paroxistico. Si se presume que dicho evento es el resultado de una descarga neuronal anormal y excesiva, se considera una crisis de mecanismo epileptico, diferenciandolo de otros tipos de eventos paroxisticos no epilepticos como los sincopes, los espasmos del sollozo, las migranas o las crisis psicogenas (conversivas o pseudocrisis). Cuando el evento paroxistico de mecanismo epileptico se caracteriza principalmente por contracciones musculares involuntarias, ya sean mantenidas (tonicas) o interrumpidas (clonicas), se le denomina crisis convulsiva o convulsion. Si las primeras manifestaciones clinicas de la convulsion orientan a que inicialmente se produjo una activacion neuronal anatomica o funcional de una parte de un hemisferio cerebral, la crisis se clasifica como parcial. Por el contrario, en las crisis generalizadas los primeros cambios clinicos indican un compromiso inicial sincronizado de ambos hemisferios, con perdida de conocimiento desde el inicio de la crisis, y no hay evidencia clinica, electroencefalografica o de otro tipo que sugiera un inicio focal o parcial. El siguiente paso es fundamental en la elaboracion diagnostica, y consiste en determinar si existe una probable causa aguda que pueda haber precipitado la convulsion. Estas causas agudas pueden ser neurologicas, como en el caso de los ninos que presentan una infeccion del sistema nervioso central (SNC) en curso (meningoencefalitis o encefalitis agudas), un tumor encefalico, o las crisis que ocurren en los siete dias siguientes a un accidente cerebrovascular o a un traumatismo craneoencefalico. Las crisis tambien pueden ser precipitadas por una causa sistemica como la fiebre en las convulsiones febriles, por causas metabolicas como las alteraciones electroliticas –que se pueden presentar, por ejemplo, en un lactante con una diarrea aguda–, u otras causas metabolicas como una hipoglucemia o la hipoxia, cualquiera sea su etiologia. Tambien puede precipitarse una crisis por la repercusion encefalica de la hipertension arterial, o por una intoxicacion que puede ser producida por medicamentos –teofilina, imipramina– o por drogas como el alcohol o la cocaina (o por su supresion brusca), o por exposicion a toxicos ambientales como el monoxido de carbono o los organofosforados. La presencia o ausencia de cualquiera de estas causas agudas permite clasificar las crisis en provocadas (tambien denominadas sintomaticas agudas u ocasionales) o no provocadas, respectivamente. Las crisis no provocadas pueden presentarse en ninos con una enfermedad neurologica previa que aumente sustancialmente el riesgo de crisis de mecanismo epileptico, como puede ser una encefalopatia no progresiva resultado de una lesion cerebral producida previamente por un sindrome hipoxico-isquemico, una meningoencefalitis o una encefalitis, una enfermedad cerebrovascular o un traumatismo de craneo grave. En estos casos, las crisis se denominan no provocadas o secundarias. Menos frecuentemente, las crisis no provocadas pueden presentarse en ninos portadores de un trastorno progresivo del SNC. Sin embargo, en la mayor parte de los casos las crisis no provocadas se presentan en ninos en los cuales no LOS EXPERTOS RESPONDEN Arch Pediatr Urug 2002; 73(4): 233-235",

      "abstract": "There has been a growing recognition that psychosis, its impact on the treatment of motor symptoms, and its interaction with cognitive dysfunction, represent a major unmet need in the treatment of advanced Parkinson's disease (PD). Psychosis in PD is predominantly, although perhaps not exclusively, medication-induced. All anti-Parkinsonian drugs in current use, not just levodopa, are capable of producing drug-induced psychosis in patients with PD. Cognitive impairment and depression are strong predictors of risk for the development of hallucinations with PD. Hallucinations and psychosis can occur at any time in the course of PD, but they are most commonly seen as a late complication in susceptible individuals. Visual hallucinations are the most common feature of drug-induced psychosis in PD, although other types of hallucinations have also been reported. Insight that the images are not real may be retained. The mechanisms responsible for producing drug-induced psychosis in PD are poorly understood, and treatment can be approached in a stepwise manner. A triggering factor, such as infection, should be excluded. If one is not discovered, step-by-step tapering of anti-Parkinson medication should then be undertaken. If increased motor disability prevents adequate dosage reduction, quetiapine is a reasonable first-choice antipsychotic agent to employ.",

      "abstract": "The review focuses on the problem of nervous system dysfunction in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM), which can be manifested by neuropsychological stress (NPN), cognitive impairment and dementia, which negatively affect both metabolic processes and feelings of well-being and quality of life. The gradual development of neurovascular disorders, as well as chronic systemic inflammation associated with atherosclerosis and immune disorders are the causes of neuropsychological and neurophysiological disarrays. Cholinergic mechanisms and hyperactivation of the sympathetic-adrenal and hypothalamic-pituitary systems contribute to the secretion of stress hormones, increase mental stress against the background of chronic metabolic stress. Therefore, the assessment of the degree of NPN can be useful for characterizing the state of neuropsychological, neurophysiological processes and determining the treatment strategy for patients with type 2 DM. In general, current studies of neuropsychological parameters in patients with DM have shown that the disease adversely affects the neurocognitive characteristics of these patients. This is due to the main pathogenetic mechanisms (indicators of insulin resistance, markers of inflammation, atherogenesis and vascular dysfunction, changes in the secretion of stress hormones and neurotransmitters). Both type 2 DM and aging, can affect the development of neuropsychiatric abnormalities in patients with mental stress, memory, ability to concentrate, and cognition. Investigation of these effects and the development of methods for monitoring, prevention and pharmacotherapy of these disorders can be useful for improving the health of the elderly people, especially of patients with type 2 DM. Modern antidiabetic drugs can have a protective effect on the peripheral and central nervous system due to their hypoglycemic effects. Mechanisms of neuroprotective effect include antioxidant and anti-inflammatory action, antiapoptotic effect, enhanced neuronal differentiation. Agents for correction of intestinal microbiota also provide positive effects.",

      "title": "Is Delirium the Cognitive Harbinger of Frailty in Older Adults? A Review about the Existing Evidence",
      "abstract": "Frailty is a clinical syndrome defined by the age-related depletion of the individual's homeostatic reserves, determining an increased susceptibility to stressors and disproportionate exposure to negative health changes. The physiological systems that are involved in the determination of frailty are mutually interrelated, so that when decline starts in a given system, implications may also regard the other systems. Indeed, it has been shown that the number of abnormal systems is more predictive of frailty than those of the abnormalities in any particular system. Delirium is a transient neurocognitive disorder, characterized by an acute onset and fluctuating course, inattention, cognitive dysfunction, and behavioral abnormalities, that complicates one out of five hospital admissions. Delirium is independently associated with the same negative outcomes of frailty and, like frailty, its pathogenesis is usually multifactorial, depending on complex inter-relationships between predisposing and precipitating factors. By definition, a somatic cause should be identified, or at least suspected, to diagnose delirium. Delirium and frailty potentially share multiple pathophysiologic mechanisms and pathways, meaning that they could be thought of as the two sides to the same coin. This review aims at summarizing the existing evidence, referring both to human and animal models, to postulate that delirium may represent the cognitive harbinger of a state of frailty in older persons experiencing an acute clinical event.",

Essa pesquisa buscou investigar, através da literatura, a relação entre comprometimento cognitivo e ansiedade em pacientes com a Doença de Parkinson. Trata-se de uma revisão integrativa da literatura realizada em julho de 2024, nas bases de dados MEDLINE, LILACS e BDENF. Para o levantamento de dados, utilizaram-se os descritores “Ansiedade”, “Doença de Parkinson” e “Declínio Cognitivo”, resultando em 5 artigos que respondiam ao objetivo da revisão. A evidência crescente destaca que os sintomas ansiosos têm um impacto significativo no comprometimento cognitivo em pacientes com doença de Parkinson. A associação entre a ausência de atividade física e o aumento da ansiedade, bem como o benefício do apoio familiar na redução dos sintomas ansiosos, reforça a importância de estratégias de manejo abrangentes. Apesar da alta prevalência de ansiedade, que pode afetar até 50% dos pacientes e comprometer severamente a qualidade de vida, a pesquisa atual ainda se concentra predominantemente em transtornos depressivos. Isso sugere uma subestimação da ansiedade na prática clínica, evidenciando a necessidade urgente de uma compreensão mais profunda e de abordagens terapêuticas mais eficazes para tratar a ansiedade e outros sintomas não motores da doença de Parkinson.",

La enfermedad de Parkinson (EP) es una entidad compleja con una sintomatologia diversa que presenta, ademas de los clasicos sintomas motores, un amplio numero de sintomas no motores. Estos sintomas son muy prevalentes desde el inicio de la enfermedad e incluso pueden preceder en el tiempo a los sintomas motores (estrenimiento, alteracion del olfato, trastorno de conducta del sueno REM) actuando como marcadores precoces de la enfermedad. Causan importante impacto en la calidad de vida de los enfermos con EP. Pueden ser los sintomas mas incapacitantes para el paciente. Por todo ello, precisan de un manejo adecuado que mejore el bienestar de nuestros pacientes. Objetivo. Dar una vision actualizada del tratamiento de los sintomas no motores mas prevalentes de la EP. Desarrollo. Se describen los sintomas no motores (vegetativos, trastornos del sueno, apatia) mas prevalentes y discapacitantes de la enfermedad de Parkinson y se hace una revision actualizada de su tratamiento. Conclusion: La alteracion que la enfermedad produce en otros sistemas distintos al dopaminergico causa un amplio numero de sintomas distintos a los motores. Su mejor conocimiento permitira diagnosticar y optimizar el tratamiento de estos sintomas, reforzando el bienestar de nuestros pacientes.",

      "abstract": "Depression is a combination of affective, cognitive, and behavioural symptoms. Each of these symptom types is probably related to different brain processes that are altered in the depressed state. A further line of investigation is in the exploring of these brain processes. Even if the symptoms presenting in the patients are not able to discriminate between the underlying aetiologies, it is possible that associated neurocognitive deficits do. Depression is a disorder of mood, cognition, and behaviour with associated disturbance of brain structure and function. Psychomotor retardation reflects ventral striatum-cortico-thalamic network dysfunction and is associated with severe depression. There is decreased hippocampal volume and disturbed memory and learning in depression. Amygdala–anterior cingulate networks normally responsible for emotion regulation are disturbed in depression. Cognitive distortions seen in depression have associated abnormalities in prefrontal regions. Neurocognitive characteristics can distinguish between unipolar and bipolar depressive disorders.",

      "abstract": "Holistic management of Parkinson's disease, now recognised as a combined motor and nonmotor disorder, remains a key unmet need. Such management needs relatively accurate definition of the various stages of Parkinson's from early untreated to late palliative as each stage calls for personalised therapies. Management also needs to have a robust knowledge of the progression pattern and clinical heterogeneity of the presentation of Parkinson's which may manifest in a motor dominant or nonmotor dominant manner. The \"advanced\" stages of Parkinson's disease qualify for advanced treatments such as with continuous infusion or stereotactic surgery yet the concept of \"advanced Parkinson's disease\" (APD) remains controversial in spite of growing knowledge of the natural history of the motor syndrome of PD. Advanced PD is currently largely defined on the basis of consensus opinion and thus with several caveats. Nonmotor aspects of PD may also reflect advancing course of the disorder, so far not reflected in usual scale based assessments which are largely focussed on motor symptoms. In this paper, we discuss the problems with current definitions of \"advanced\" PD and also propose the term \"complex phase\" Parkinson's disease as an alternative which takes into account a multimodal symptoms and biomarker based approach in addition to patient preference.",

      "title": "Music Therapy for Motor and Nonmotor Symptoms of Parkinson's Disease: A Prospective, Randomized, Controlled, Single‐Blinded Study",
      "abstract": "To the Editor: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder that affects adults.1 Mainly considered in the past as solely a motor disease, the coexistence of a complex set of nonmotor symptoms, including neuropsychiatric symptoms, has been confirmed.2 Lacking a cure, management consists of optimization of drug therapy and its implementation in addition to nonpharmacological treatments. One of the available alternative therapies is music therapy (MT), which uses music and its elements (sound, rhythm, melody, harmony) to promote mobilization and mental activation. To the knowledge of the authors, the effect of active MT on cognition in PD has not been explored. Twenty-five individuals with a diagnosis of PD,3 mild disability, and stable treatment who were free of dementia, depression, or serious comorbidity and were not undergoing treatment that would interfere with cognition were enrolled and randomly assigned to MT or no treatment (control). At baseline, at the end of the MT program (6 months), and 6 months after the end of MT program (12 months) all participants were evaluated for quality of life (QoL) and underwent a detailed motor and neuropsychological examination assessing executive function, attention, visuospatial skills, memory, and language. The motor examiner (ES) and the neuropsychologist (AL) were blinded to group assignment. MT sessions were held once a week for 24 weeks; each session lasted 90 minutes and consisted of production of music, singing, and dancing. Variations within each group over time in clinical and neuropsychiatric measures were assessed using the Wilcoxon test. Significance was set at P < .05. A beneficial effect of active MT on cognition was detected (Table 1). There was improvement at the end of the program on tests examining frontal lobe function (cognitive flexibility, processing speed, attention, working memory), suggesting that MT might enhance frontal function by acting as a training ground for these cognitive skills, given that producing music stimulates attention and executive functions such as planning, flexible thinking, and execution. Furthermore, improvement in memory was observed as reflected by increases in Rey immediate and delayed recall scores; again, active execution of music would stimulate memory processes through the flexible recovery of songs and motor sequences. These findings are consistent with those of previous studies reporting beneficial effects of MT on frontal function and memory in individuals with brain injury4 and mild cognitive impairment and dementia.5 Nevertheless, there were no significant differences between baseline and 6 months after the end of the program (Table 1), confirming that the beneficial effects of MT on cognitive performance tend to vanish after treatment ends. No significant variations were detected over time in control participants on any cognitive measures apart from isolated improvement on Rey immediate recall at the end of the intervention and deterioration in verbal fluency between the end of the intervention and 6 months later (Table 1); these variations were not significant from baseline to 12 months later, suggesting only insignificant cognitive fluctuations. Consistent with previous MT trials, significant improvement of QoL was found, especially for emotional well-being at the end of the intervention (Table 1), supporting the holistic effects of MT on emotional state; again, this beneficial effect regressed 6 months after treatment ended. Conversely, controls deteriorated on the 39-item Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39) bodily discomfort and mobility subscales, in line with disease progression and, unexpectedly, improved on the cognition subscale in absence of improvement on any cognitive test, probably reflecting individuals' fluctuating perceptions of their cognitive abilities. Regarding motor symptoms, there were no significant beneficial effects of MT on Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale or Timed Up and Go (TUG) scores (Table 1). In particular, there was no significant difference in TUG scores between baseline and the end of the intervention or 6 months later, but there was significant deterioration between the end of the intervention and 6 months later. This probably reflects a beneficial effect of active MT on gait and stability, as revealed by TUG total scores at baseline and the end of the intervention, in agreement with recent meta-analysis data;6 nevertheless this effect was not statistically significant in this population, maybe because of a large standard deviation within the groups or small sample size. The lack of deterioration from baseline to 6 months after the intervention would support this hypothesis. In addition, consistent with previous studies,7, 8 the beneficial effect of MT on gait and stability would disappear after discontinuation, as revealed by significant deterioration between the end of the intervention and 6 months later. Conversely, controls showed significant deterioration in TUG scores 1 and 3 between baseline and 6 months after the end of the intervention (Table 1), as would be expected in the natural progression of disease. The present pilot study shows, for the first time in PD, that active MT has a beneficial effect on frontal function, even though this effect tends to disappear after the intervention is stopped, suggesting that MT should be continued for longer.

      "abstract": "Focal imaging abnormalities in patients with parkinsonism suggest secondary etiology and require a distinctive clinical approach to diagnosis and treatment. We review different entities presenting as secondary parkinsonism associated with structural brain lesions, with emphasis on the clinical course and neuroimaging findings. Secondary parkinsonism may be due to vascular causes, hydrocephalus, space-occupying lesions, metabolic causes (including acquired hepatocerebral degeneration, diabetic uremic encephalopathy, basal ganglia calcifications, osmotic demyelination syndrome), hypoxic-ischaemic brain injury, intoxications (including methanol, carbon monoxide, cyanide, carbon disulfide, manganese poisoning and illicit drugs), infections and immune causes. The onset can vary from acute to chronic. Both uni-and bilateral presentations are possible. Rigidity, bradykinesia and gait abnormalities are more common than rest tremor. Coexisting other movement disorders and additional associated neurological signs may point to the underlying diagnosis. Neuroimaging studies are an essential part in the diagnostic work-up of secondary parkinsonism and may point directly to the underlying etiology. We focus primarily on magnetic resonance imaging to illustrate how structural imaging combined with neurological assessment can lead to diagnosis. It is crucial that typical imaging abnormalities are recognized within the relevant clinical context. Many forms of secondary parkinsonism are reversible with elimination of the specific cause, while some may benefit from symptomatic treatment. This heterogeneous group of acquired disorders has also helped shape our knowledge of Parkinson's disease and basal ganglia pathophysiology, while more recent findings in the field garner support for the network perspective on brain function and neurological disorders.",

      "title": "Acquired Aphasia, Dementia, and Behavior Disorder with Epilepsy and Continuous Spike and Waves During Sleep in a Child",
      "abstract": "Summary: Severe persistent neuropsychological disorders sometimes develop in the course of a focal epilepsy of unknown origin in previously normal children. Very frequent bilateral focal or generalized discharges are often noted on the sleep EEG records of these patients with no evidence of clinical seizures. The relation between these paroxysms and the observed deterioration remains unclear. We report a child with a partial complex epilepsy and severe disturbances of language, cognition, and behavior acquired in the early years of development who was followed for 15 years. A correlation between the evolution of the striking EEG abnormalities during sleep and the neuropsychological disorders could be established retrospectively. The observed sequence of onset and recovery of the aphasia, the dementia, and the “psychotic” behavior makes a direct causal relation between these deficits quite unlikely. Rather it suggests an association of independent symptoms with a specific language disorder becoming manifest in the course of the evolution. This child shows many of the main characteristics of the syndromes of “acquired aphasia with convulsive disorder” (Landau‐Kleffner syndrome) and “epilepsy with continuous spike and waves during sleep.” Both syndromes describe probably different facets of a similar underlying, still unexplained cerebral dysfunction. RÉSUMÉ Des troubles neuropsychologiques séverès et persistants peuvent survenir au cours ďune épilepsie focale ďétiologie inconnue chez des enfants auparavant normaux. Chez ces patients, on trouve souvent de très nombreuses décharges focales bilatéiales ou généralisées àľEEG de sommeil, sans crise clinique. La relation entre ces paroxysmes et la détérioration observée reste peu claire. Nous rapportons en détail le cas ďun enfant présentant une épilepsie partielle complexe et des troubles séverès du langage, des fonctions cognitives et du comportement acquis précocément au cours du développement, que nous avons suivi durant 15 ans. Une correlation entre ľévolution des anomalies EEG bilatérales durant le sommeil et des déficits neuropsychologiques a pûêtre établie rétrospectivement. Le mode de survenue et de récupération de ľaphasie, de la démence et du comportement “psychotique” rendent peu probable une relation causale entre ces déficits. II suggère plutôt une association de symptômes indepéndants avec un trouble spécifique du langage devenu prédominant au cours de ľévolution. Cet enfant présente la plupart des caractéristiques principales des syndromes ď“aphasie acquise avec épilepsie” et ď“épilepsie avec pointes‐ondes continues du sommeil.” Ces deux syndromes décrivent probablement des facettes différentes ďune même dysfonction cérébrale sous‐jacente dont la nature reste inexpliquée. RESUMEN En ocasiones, trastornos neuropsicológicos severos y persistentes surgen en el curso de una epilepsía focal de causa desconocida, en niños previamente normales. En estos pacientes, sin ataques clínicos, muy frecuentemente se registran descargas focales generalizadas que aparecen en los EEGs registrados durante el sueño. La relación entre estos paroxismos y el deterioro clínico permanece oscura. Se presenta un caso de un niño con epilepsía parcial compleja y severa alteración cognitiva, del lenguaje y del comportamiento que aparecieron en los años iniciales del desarrollo. Este nino ha sido seguido durante 15 afios. De modo retrospectivo fue posible establecer una correlación entra la evolución de las llamativas anomalías del EEG durante el sueño y los trastornos neuropsicológicos. La secuen‐ciaobservada entre el comienzo y la recuperación de la afasia, la dementia y el comportamiento “psicótico”, hace que una relción directa causal entre estos problemas sea muy improbable. Más bien sugiere una asociacíon de síntomas independientes con un trastorno específico del lenguaje que aparece en primer piano en el curso de la evolución. Este niño mostró muchas de las características principales de los síndromes “afasia adquirida con trastornos convulsivos (síndrome de Landau‐Kleffner)” y “epilepsía con continuas complejos punta‐onda durante el sueño”. Ambos síndromes probablemente describen diferentes facetas de una disfunción cerebral subyacente todavía inexplicada. ZUSAMMENFASSUNG Gelegentlich entwickeln sich bei vormals normalen Kindern im Verlauf einer fokalen Epilepsie unklarer Ätiologie schwere persistierende neuropsychologische Störungen. Bei solchen Patienten werden häufig zahlreiche bilateral fokale oder generalisierte Entladungen im Schlaf‐EEG ohne klinische Anfälle gefunden. Die Beziehung zwischen den Paroxysmen und der beobachteten mentalen Verschlechterung bleibt unklar, Wir berichten über ein Kind mit einer partiell komplexen Epilepsie und schweren Störungen der Sprache, der kognitiven Fähigkeiten und des Verhaltens, die in frühen Jahren erworben wurden. Das Kind wurde über 15 Jahre lang weiter verfolgt. Rückblickend kann eine Korrelation zwischen der Entwicklung den EEG‐Auffälligkeiten wahrend des Schlafs und den neuropsychologischen Störungen hergestellt werden. Die beobachtete Folge im Auftreten und Wiederrückbildung der Aphasie, der Demenz und der “psychotischen” Verhaltensstörungen macht eine direkte kausale Beziehung zwischen diesen Defiziten unwahrscheinlich. Sie legt vielmehr eine Assoziation unabhängiger Symptome mit einer spezifischen Sprachstörung nahe, die im Laufe der Entwicklung in den Vordergrund tritt. Das Kind zeigt viele der Hauptcharakteristika des Syndroms der “erworbenen Aphasie mit Anfallserkrankung” (Landau‐Kleffner‐Syndrom) und der “Epilepsie mit kontinuierlichen Spike Wave Entladungen während des Schlafs”. Beide Syndrome beschreiben wahrscheinlich verschiedene Facetten einer ähnlichen bis jetzt ungeklärten zerebralen Stöning.",

      "title": "Shingles vaccination reduces the risk of Parkinson's disease",
      "abstract": "The most prevalent age-related movement condition, Parkinson's disease (PD), is characterized by bradykinesia, resting tremor, unbalanced gait, muscular rigidity, postural instability, as well as some nonmotor symptoms like autonomic and cognitive dysfunctions. PD is caused by a loss of nerve cells in a part of the brain, the substantia nigra. These cells are responsible for producing dopamine, which acts as a messenger between the brain and nervous system that helps control and coordinate body movements. If the nerve cells in the substantia nigra die or become damaged, the amount of dopamine in the brain is reduced. Motor control is impaired, causing movements to become slow and abnormal. The loss of nerve cells is a slow process. The symptoms of PD usually only start to develop when around 80% of the nerve cells in the substantia nigra have been lost.1 Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites collect alpha-synuclein in PD. Select peripheral autonomic nervous system neurons and central nervous system neurons are affected. The incidence of PD rises with age, and the lifetime frequency is 1%–5%. Multiple twin studies support the idea that environmental factors play a larger role in disease pathogenesis than do genetic factors, even though evidence for a few rare genetic mutations in a small subset of young people with PD cases offers some insights into the pathogenesis.2 Although the precise cause of PD is uncertain, mounting evidence points to viral infection as a potential factor. For instance, the varicella-zoster virus (VZV) may remain dormant in the ganglia and reawaken because of weakened immunity or aging. Herpes zoster (shingles) is a VZV infection that causes a painful skin rash and blisters on the dermatome infected. Herpes zoster may be related to PD, according to recent research.3, 4 Herpes zoster vaccination protects against Alzheimer's disease (AD), which is related to herpes virus infection.5-9 In the current analysis we attempted to determine if herpes zoster vaccination might reduce the risk of PD. Data on PD prevalence by US state is from Mantri et al.10 They identified 27,538,023 Medicare beneficiaries that met inclusion criteria, of whom 392,214 had a PD diagnosis in 2014. Data on Shingles vaccination among adults aged 60 and over in the US in 2018 is from Terlizzi and Black.11 The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) data from 2008 to 2018 were used for this investigation. The NHIS is a household survey of the civilian, noninstitutionalized US population that is conducted nationally. It is continually carried out by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) during the entire year. Although follow-ups to completed interviews may be made over the phone, interviews are conducted in respondents' homes. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS software (version 26.0, IBM). District of Columbia, New York, Illinois, Connecticut, and Florida had the lowest age-adjusted prevalence ranks and highest age-adjusted prevalence of PD. Figure 1 shows age-adjusted PD prevalence ranks in 50 US states and the District of Columbia versus the proportion of adults who had ever received a shingles vaccine. The relationship is statistically significant (p = 0.005, two-tailed). States with the most PD (lowest age-adjusted prevalence ranks) had the lowest proportion of adults aged 60 and over who had ever received a shingles vaccine. States with the highest prevalence of PD are defined to be states with the lowest prevalence ranks of PD. The proportion of female subjects versus the proportion of adults who had ever received a shingles vaccine is in Figure 2. The relationship is statistically significant (p < 0.001, two-tailed). Increased vaccination proportion led to significantly reduced female PD prevalence. Men have a higher incidence of PD.12 The proportion of dual eligibility for Medicare and Medicaid versus the proportion of adults who had ever received a shingles vaccine is in Figure 3. The relationship is statistically significant (p = 0.003, two-tailed). An increased proportion of dual eligibility is associated with a diminished proportion of adults who had ever received a shingles vaccine. Studies of Herpes zoster virus (HZV) infection and PD have been unclear as to whether HZV and PD are related. Peripheral T lymphocytes and B lymphocytes may decline over the course of PD. Herpes zoster may have the potential to develop later throughout the normal course of PD because of the reduction in cell-mediated immunity according to a theory put forth by Lai et al.4 In contrast, Cheng et al.2 report that people with herpes zoster have a higher chance of developing PD and hypothesize that risk may be influenced by the inflammation associated with the herpes zoster infection. To pinpoint the precise pathophysiological relationship between herpes zoster and the risk of PD, more research is necessary. PD may be due to late-life reactivation of embryologic pathways and processes silenced at birth. Viruses such as HZV may play a part.8 The ecological fallacy, also known as the ecological inference fallacy, is a logical fallacy in the interpretation of statistical data where inferences about the nature of individuals are derived from inference for the group to which those individuals belong.13 The fallacy could confound our study's results. In this instance, rather than from the individuals themselves, assumptions regarding PD in individuals are being made based on the features of the US states in which they reside. Medicaid covers shingles vaccine only in states with expanded Medicaid coverage, not all states. Medicare covers shingles vaccination only for people with part D prescription plans. Therefore, many people with dual coverage would not be eligible for vaccine coverage. An increased proportion of Medicare Medicaid dual eligibility associated with a diminished proportion of adults who had ever received a shingles vaccine (Figure 3) implies that shingles vaccination is not being administered to many dual eligibles. The zoster vaccine, live, was discontinued in the United States on November 18, 2020. Zoster vaccine recombinant, adjuvanted, which is more effective, is given as two intramuscular doses 6 months apart. Cigarette smoking and coffee drinking reduce the risk of PD. Shingles vaccination could be another factor that reduces PD risk. Further studies are warranted.14 Steven Lehrer and Peter H.

Patients may experience blurred vision, sensitivity to light, difficulties in reading, and a subjective feeling of rapid eye fatigue. The visual impairments also affect the patients' motor skills, as vision compensates for poor postural control and difficulty initiating movement. It is important to identify common but frequently underdiagnosed visual impairment, and initiate measures that can increase quality of life and pattern of movement. In this clinical review we present the most common visual impairments in Parkinson's disease, as well as providing advice for improved visual function.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The concept of “subcortical dementia” is controversial, lacking clinical validation and having only a questionable pathological basis. Over 100 patients with Alzheimer's, Parkinson's or Huntington's disease, subdivided into three functional disability stages, were given a brief quantitative neuropsychological assessment. Patients with Huntington's or Parkinson's disease were less intellectually impaired than those with Alzheimer's disease at each functional stage. Criteria for dementia were present in all of the Alzheimer's patients but in only half of the Huntington's and Parkinson's disease groups. Patients with similar overall intellectual function scores had no distinct pattern of neuropsychological test performance. Depression, absent in patients with Alzheimer's disease, was present in half the patients with Huntington's and Parkinson's disease and was correlated with intellectual decline. The concept of subcortical dementia is misleading. The pattern of neuropsychological impairment is not distinct, and the neuropathological basis of dementia in these diseases may result from a combination of cortical and subcortical degeneration.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease. Patients show deposits of pathological, aggregated a-synuclein not only in the brain but throughout almost the entire length of the digestive tract. This gives rise to non-motor symptoms particularly within the gastrointestinal tract and patients experience a wide range of frequent and burdensome symptoms such as dysphagia, bloating, and constipation. Recent evidence suggests that progressive accumulation of gastrointestinal pathology is underway several years before a clinical diagnosis of PD. Notably, constipation has been shown to increase the risk of developing PD and in contrast, truncal vagotomy seems to decrease the risk of PD. Animal models have demonstrated gut-to-brain spreading of pathological a-synuclein and it is currently being intensely studied whether PD begins in the gut of some patients. Gastrointestinal symptoms in PD have been investigated by the use of several different questionnaires. However, there is limited correspondence between subjective gastrointestinal symptoms and objective dysfunction along the gastrointestinal tract, and often the magnitude of dysfunction is underestimated by the use of questionnaires. Therefore, objective measures are important tools to clarify the degree of dysfunction in future studies of PD. Here, we summarize the types and prevalence of subjective gastrointestinal symptoms and objective dysfunction in PD. The potential importance of the gastrointestinal tract in the etiopathogenesis of PD is briefly discussed.",

It is primarily a psychic and secondarily a somatic disturbance. Inasmuch as the personality reaction of the individual suffering from anorexia nervosa more nearly conforms to compulsion neurosis than that of any other psychiatric disorder and, in addition, has cachexia rather than anorexia as a leading symptom, it is suggested that the illness would be more accurately termed compulsion neurosis with cachexia. Although definitive data as to etiology are not available, evidence presented indicates that constitutional defect probably predisposes to the illness, which becomes manifest at puberty or shortly thereafter because of severe and deep psychological conflicts centering in the family constellation. The dynamics of these conflicts are discussed and the conclusion drawn that the patient's basic difficulty lies in her more intimate interpersonal relationships. Adequate physiological and psychological treatment, described in detail, offers a reasonably good prognosis, although the tendency to relapse is great.",

      "abstract": "Introdução: A Doença de Parkinson (DP) é uma das doenças degenerativas mais frequentes do sistema nervoso central, tal patologia ocorre por conta da degeneração de neurônios de uma região no mesencéfalo, responsável pela produção de dopamina no cérebro, denominada substancia negra. A diminuição da produção de dopamina resulta em desordens do movimento causando tremores, rigidez muscular, desequilíbrio, lentidão de movimentos, além de alterações na fala e na escrita. A etiologia da doença ainda é incerta, mas estudos indicam a possibilidade de estar ligada a distúrbios genéticos e fatores ambientais. Segundo a Organização Mundial de Saúde (OMS) aproximadamente 1% da população mundial com idade superior a 65 anos tem a doença e no Brasil estima-se que 200 mil pessoas sofram com a patologia. Apesar dos esforços da comunidade cientifica em busca de tratamento para a DP ainda não é possível evitar efetivamente a progressão da doença por via medicamentosa. A fisioterapia utiliza de diversos recursos para auxiliar esses pacientes na manutenção ou recuperação de suas funcionalidades e por isso é indicada em todas as fases da doença. Dentre os objetivos do tratamento fisioterapêutico destaca-se: minimizar e retardar a progressão dos sintomas, melhorar força muscular, equilíbrio e aptidão física, concedendo aos pacientes mais autonomia e independência. Objetivos: Este trabalho apresenta como objetivo realizar uma extensa revisão bibliográfica sobre a relevância do tratamento fisioterapêutico no tratamento de pacientes portadores de Parkinson. Material e métodos: Este é um estudo de revisão bibliográfica, onde foram utilizados sites de busca, como PUBMED e SCIELO, através das palavras-chave: fisioterapia, Parkinson, promoção de saúde, tratamento. Resultados: Como resultado da pesquisa foi possível comprovar que a fisioterapia tem papel fundamental no tratamento de pacientes com Parkinson aja vista a melhora que as práticas terapêuticas geraram na qualidade de vida dos pacientes. Conclusões: Conclui-se então que a fisioterapia por meio dos recursos convencionais e recursos como a realidade virtual e terapia aquática contribuem enormemente para a manutenção da funcionalidade, e qualidade de vida dos pacientes portadores de Parkinson.",

      "abstract": "Introduccion: La Enfermedad de Parkinson (EP) es una enfermedad neurodegenerativa causada por la perdida selectiva de neuronas dopaminergicas de la sustancia negra pars compacta y de otros nucleos del troncoencefalico. Se caracteriza por la presencia de sintomas motores, por el deposito difuso de alfa-sinucleina (componente de los cuerpos de Lewy) y por trastornos cognitivos, los cuales se presentan en grado variable alrededor de los 10 a los 15 anos de evolucion, lo cual retrasa de forma importante algun tipo de intervencion. Asimismo, en algunos casos no se logra identificar si el deterioro que muestran los pacientes con EP es propio del envejecimiento normal del sujeto o se debe a la evolucion de la enfermedad. Objetivo: Analizar los rendimientos cognitivos en pacientes con EP sin demencia (GPO1), comparando los resultados con los obtenidos por una muestra de sujetos sin EP (GP2), sin antecedentes neurologicos o psiquiatricos clinicamente demostrables y con caracteristicas sociodemograficas similares a los pacientes con EP. Procedimiento: Participaron voluntariamente 80 sujetos mexicanos (40 hombres y 40 mujeres). Una vez satisfechos los criterios de inclusion, los participantes del GPO1 Y GPO2 fueron evaluados con la Bateria Neuropsicologica Breve en Espanol NEUROPSI, (Ostrosky-Solis, Ardila y Rosselli, 1994). Resultados: Nuestros datos indican que los sujetos con EP sin demencia presentan un rendimiento cognitivo inferior en comparacion con los resultados obtenidos por el grupo de sujetos sin EP, particularmente en tareas de orientacion en tiempo, de fluidez semantica, de fluidez fonologica, de escritura, funciones motoras, memoria visoespacial y memoria verbal. Asimismo, se mostro que la ejecucion de las tareas de deteccion visual, de denominacion, de repeticion y de lectura en voz alta, por parte del grupo con EP, recibieron un mejor puntaje en comparacion de lo realizado por el grupo sin EP. Finalmente, aunque el analisis de los resultados mostro que los puntajes obtenidos por ambos grupos en las tareas de orientacion en lugar y persona, de digitos en regresion, de resta sucesiva, de curva de memoria espontanea, de relacion de semejanzas, de calculo y de secuenciacion, no guardan diferencias significativas entre si, sus rendimientos generales son bajos. Conclusiones: El analisis de nuestros resultados nos permite concluir que los sujetos con EP, presentan un rendimiento cognitivo inferior en comparacion al obtenido por el grupo de sujetos sanos con caracteristicas sociodemograficas semejantes en la Bateria NEUROPSI. El analisis cualitativo de los resultados, nos permite realizar no solo la enumeracion de los sintomas como elementos aislados, sino que nos permite establecer posibles vias de intervencion neuropsicologica.",

Although the disease symptomatology can be well controlled by levodopa, related medications and deep brain stimulation, the etiology of PD remains obscure. The epidemiological features have been discussed in depth in the literature, but the methodologies used to approach the issues have varied greatly, and the results cover a wide range of factors and are generally inconclusive. The crude prevalence rate of PD has been reported to range from 15 per 100,000 to 12,500 per 100,000, and the incidence of PD from 15 per 100,000 to 328 per 100,000, with the disease being less common in Asian countries. Risk factor studies have pinpointed cigarette smoking, coffee/tea consumption and alcohol drinking as being mostly related to a lower risk of PD. The relationship between a higher risk of PD and drinking well-water and being exposed to herbicides/pesticides is controversial. Systemic diseases including gout, hyperlipidemia and hypertension may be related to a reduced risk of PD. A family history of PD, tremor, depression and head injury are related to a higher risk of PD. Genetic studies of the glucocerebrosidase, parkin and LRRK2 genes have contributed to our understanding of familial PD but not of sporadic PD. The health-related quality of life of PD patients is related not only to their motor disability, but also to their non-motor symptoms of depression, sleep disturbance, bladder and sexual dysfunction. The economic burden of PD is enormous, and the annual cost of medical service per PD patient can reach €13,804 (NT$599,547).",

      "title": "Borderline, Bipolar, or Both? Frame Your Diagnosis on the Patient History",
      "abstract": "Borderline personality disorder (BPD) and bipolar disorder are frequently confused with each other, in part because of their considerable symptomatic overlap. This redundancy occurs despite the different ways these disorders are conceptualized: BPD as a personality disorder and bipolar disorder as a brain disease among Axis I clinical disorders. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] BPD and bipolar disorder--especially bipolar II--often co-occur (Box, page 22) and are frequently misidentified, as shown by clinical and epidemiologic studies. Misdiagnosis creates problems for clinicians and patients. When diagnosed with BPD, patients with bipolar disorder may be deprived of potentially effective pharmacologic treatments. (1) Conversely, the stigma that BPD carries--particularly in the mental health community--may lead clinicians to: Nonchance explanations for the diagnostic overlap between BPD and bipolar disorder * [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] 1. Inability of current nosology to separate 2 distinct conditions [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Relatively indistinct diagnostic boundaries confuse the differentiation of borderline personality disorder (BPD) and bipolar disorder (5 of 9 BPD criteria may occur with mania or hypomania). In this model, the person has 1 disorder but because of symptom overlap receives a diagnosis of both. Because structured interviews do not allow for subjective judgment or expert opinion, the result is the generation of 2 diagnoses when 1 may provide a more parsimonious and valid explanation. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] 2. BPD exists on a spectrum with bipolar disorder The mood lability of BPD may be viewed as not unlike that seen with bipolar disorder. (a) Behaviors displayed by patients with BPD are subsequently conceptualized as arising from their unstable mood. Supporting arguments cite family study data and evidence from pharmacotherapy trials of anticonvulsants, including divalproex, for rapid cycling bipolar disorder and BPD. (b) Family studies have been notable for their failure to directly characterize family members, however, and clinical trials have been quite small. Further, treatment response may have very limited nosologic implications. 3. Bipolar disorder is a risk factor for BPD [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] 4. BPD is a risk factor for bipolar disorder [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Early emergence of a bipolar disorder (in preadolescent or adolescent patients) has been proposed to disrupt psychological development, leading to BPD. This adverse impact on personality development--the scar hypothesis (c)--is supported by data showing greater risk of co-occurring BPD with earlier onset bipolar disorder. (d) More important, prospective studies of patients with bipolar disorder show a greater risk for developing BPD. (e) BPD also may be a risk factor for the development of bipolar disorder--the vulnerability hypothesis. (c) Patients with BPD are more likely to develop bipolar disorder, even compared to patients with other personality disorders. (e) 5. Shared risk factors [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] BPD and bipolar disorder may be linked by shared risk factors, such as shared genes or trait neuroticism. (c) * Some evidence supports each potential explanation, and they are not necessarily mutually exclusive * not even disclose the BPD diagnosis to patients (2) * lean in the direction of diagnosing BPD as bipolar disorder, potentially resulting in treatments that have little relevance or failure to refer for more appropriate psychosocial treatments. To help you avoid confusion and the pitfalls of misdiagnosis, this article clarifies the distinctions between bipolar disorder and BPD. We discuss symptom overlap, highlight key differences between the constructs, outline diagnostic differences, and provide useful suggestions to discern the differential diagnosis. …",

      "abstract": "Most movement disorders in children are hyperkinetic. The most common type is tic disorders, which can involve motor and phonic tics and are classified as simple or complex. Motor or phonic tics that persist for more than 1 year are defined as persistent (chronic) tic disorder. Tourette syndrome can be diagnosed if a child has multiple motor tics and at least one phonic tic for more than 1 year with onset before age 18 years. Children with Tourette syndrome may have symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, or behavioral disorders. Chorea can be seen as a symptom of rheumatic fever (Sydenham chorea), in children with a history of kernicterus, and in dyskinetic cerebral palsy. Chorea also may be part of an underlying metabolic or genetic condition. Dystonia is characterized by repetitive contortions and posturing of the limbs and body. It can be isolated or part of an underlying neurologic condition. Tremor can occur as a manifestation of essential tremor or can be an enhanced physiologic tremor exacerbated by drugs, illness, or stimulants. Ataxia most often is seen as a postinfectious or postvaccination acute cerebellar ataxia. Progressive ataxias are consistent with an underlying metabolic or genetic condition. Transient and developmental movement disorders include benign neonatal sleep myoclonus, jitteriness in neonates, shuddering, and stereotypies.",

The severity of the pathology increases gradually during the course of the disorder (1–8). As such, the lesions develop already, to a mild or moderate degree, even in the nervous system of persons whose clinical protocols fail to note the onset or presence of classical IPD-associated motor symptoms (9–17). Thus, the course of the disease process can be subdivided into presymptomatic and symptomatic phases (Fig. 1A).

      "abstract": "Complementary Therapies in Neurology: An Evidence-Based Approach Edited by Barry S.Oken ISBN 1-84214-200-3 Copyright © 2004 by The Parthenon Publishing Group, LondonDementia is a common age-associated condition increasing in prevalence from about 1% at age 65 to over 50% above age 90. Dementia has many causes, some of which are easily treated (e.g. metabolic disturbances such as thyroid disease), while others have no treatments with a clear disease-modifying effect, such as the primary central nervous system degenerations1. The most common causes of dementia are Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia and these will be the only two specific diseases in addition to the non-specific dementia syndrome discussed in this chapter; other dementia syndromes are not discussed because of the lack of specific data relevant to this chapter. The clinical onset of Alzheimer's disease is considered the time point at which there are signs of cognitive dysfunction in at least two domains of cognition (e.g. memory, attention, language, visuospatial function and 'frontal lobe' function) and the cognitive dysfunction is causing problems with daily social or occupational function. Before the cognitive deficits become so problematic, there is a period when the person may have some complaints of memory loss and objective deficits in memory or other cognitive domains but has no change in more than one domain and no change in daily function. This is considered mild cognitive impairment (MCI), although there are a host of other terms for closely related conditions (e.g. age-associated memory impairment). About 50% of people with MCI may go on to develop overt Alzheimer's disease over a 5-year period2. There is also a period even prior to the onset of MCI when there is accumulating pathology in the brain and there is possible subtle cognitive change. While this chapter does not review treatments for this latter class of individuals (basically all middle-aged adults), a significant proportion of the population believes that some dietary supplements may impact aging. A Harris poll of 1010 people in the USA found that 78% of the respondents felt that vitamin supplements would provide some or a great deal of help in generally healthy people in growing old and 58% felt the same way about herbs or herbal products3. There is a high use of dietary supplements including vitamins in the aging population. Even in healthy people over the age of 85 years, 25% take vitamin C supplements, 25% vitamin E supplements and 10% Ginkgo biloba extract4.",

      "title": "Expanding the Boundaries of Early Intervention for Psychosis: Intervening During the Prodrome",
      "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;It has long been recognized that subclinical manifestations of schizophrenia are evident prior to the onset of full psychosis. This period of time, during which changes in behavior begin to emerge and then progress into more specific early signs and symptoms prior to the onset of frank psychosis, is conceptualized as the “prodrome” or “prodromal stage” of schizophrenia. The term prodrome is somewhat of a misnomer, given the connotation that illness will inevitably follow. Despite this semantic problem, the label is in wide use and in this context suggests only the potential for later development of psychosis or schizophrenia. Verification that an individual is truly at-risk for psychosis (or is in the prodromal stage) can only be determined by following subjects over time. Therefore, putatively prodromal individuals are referred to as being at “ultra high risk” or “clinical high risk” for the development of psychotic disorders. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4&gt;ABOUT THE AUTHORS&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;Andrea M.

Firstly, it may be distinguished from other causes of peripheral motor involvement such as muscle diseases and disorders of the neuromuscular junction. Secondly, it may be discussed in two different forms: acute and chronic. Acute chronic neuropathies are mainly observed in Guillain‐Barré syndrome, in which electrophysiological studies allow us to recognize the classical demyelinating form and the axonal form. The other causes of acute motor neuropathy are mainly poliomyelitis and porphyrias. Chronic motor neuropathies are mainly observed in motor neuron diseases, mainly amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, but also Kennedy’s disease and other lower motor neuron diseases which may be inherited or acquired. The other causes are multifocal motor neuropathy and the predominantly motor forms of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. The characterization of these different types of chronic neuropathy is of major importance because of the therapeutic consequences which may lead to the proposal of specific treatments.",

      "abstract": "Neurological disturbances were recorded in 46 out of 58 patients with phenylketonuria. An abnormal electroencephalogram was the most frequent finding. Motor signs were encountered in 31 cases. Only 2 patients showed true hyperkinesias and no other \"extrapyramidal\" signs were observed. Severe neurological dysfunction was most frequent in the most retarded patients. Severe motor signs only occurred in patients in their second and third decade. Twelve of the 58 patients were followed for 6 to 9 years. Five of these evolved supra-nuclear motor signs during the observation period. Two patients further showed definite progression of motor signs already present. The emergence or progression of motor disturbances always occurred in patients in their second or third decade. Thus, motor signs appear to be late phenomena while mental deficiency and epilepsy are early manifestations of phenylketonuria. This may indicate different pathogenetic mechanisms. It is suggested that motor signs are due to demyelination, previously demonstrated. The cause of demyelination may be a toxic effect of excess phenylalanine or its metabolites. Therefore, it should be reconsidered whether or not dietary treatment should be continued beyond the first decade.",

      "abstract": "Definitions Developmental dyslexia, also known as specific reading disability, is an unexpected difficulty in learning to read that occurs in the otherwise normal child. Rudel1 suggests it be defined by both exclusionary and inclusionary criteria. Her strict definition requires that five criteria be met: 1) The child must have no major neurologic abnormalities, such as overt cerebral palsy. Affected children may and often do have soft signs on neurologic examination, however. 2) The major sensory functions must be normal; the child cannot be blind or deaf. Practically speaking, children who are blind or deaf or who have cerebral palsy may be dyslexic if they have reading difficulties disproportionate to their other academic and intellectual abilities. 3) The child should have no major psychiatric problems. Problems with self-esteem are often, however, a reactive secondary issue in the child who has a learning disability. 4) Normal intelligence is required, using either a verbal or nonverbal measure. Children who have dyslexia often also have language problems. Hence, verbal intelligence scores may not reflect overall intellectual abilities accurately. 5) Finally, the dyslexic child must have been in a social and educational environment conducive to learning to read. Several studies of inner-city school children have demonstrated that enrichment programs help some nonreaders become readers, demonstrating the importance of teaching techniques.",

      "abstract": "Early cognitive changes in patients with PD are often subtle and influenced by factors that interact with the disease process, including age of disease onset, medication, and the specific constellation of motor symptoms. These factors notwithstanding, ample evidence exists that specific cognitive changes occur early in the course of PD. This evidence does not imply that cognitive deficits are pervasive during the early stages. To the contrary, they are usually subtle and often difficult to detect without formal neuropsychological testing. Executive-function deficits are the most frequently reported cognitive problems and, given that executive skills are an integral part of many tasks, it follows that subtle difficulties may be seen on a wide range of cognitive measures, particularly in working memory and visuospatial dysfunction, two areas that rely heavily on executive skills. Whereas apraxia and language processing deficits occur infrequently, subtle changes in olfaction and contrast sensitivity have also been repeatedly observed. Finally, depressive symptoms are also common in the early stages of the disease. The significance of the early behavioral changes and their prognostic implications are largely unknown. Prospective studies are needed to understand the longitudinal course of early cognitive changes to determine whether they remain as circumscribed impairments or represent a precursor to a more widespread dementia.",

      "title": "Diagnosis and management of Parkinson's disease: what the NICE guidelines say, and why",
      "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition resulting from the degeneration of the dopamine containing cells of the area of the brain known as the basal ganglia, specifically the substantia nigra. PD affects approximately 100 to 180 people per 100,000 of the general population in the UK (a total of between 10 to 20 cases per 10,000size practice) and has an annual incidence of 4 to 20 per 100,000 (Dodel et al 1998) (around one new case per 10,000-size practice per annum). The prevalence of PD rises with age with a higher prevalence and incidence in males (Ben-Shlomo 1997). There is no consistently reliable test that can distinguish PD from other conditions that have a similar clinical presentation, and so the diagnosis rests on clinical symptoms and signs. Although PD is predominately a movement disorder (poverty and slowness of movement, cogwheel rigidity and resting tremor) other non-motor impairments frequently develop and these may include depression, dementia, autonomic disturbances and pain resulting in impaired quality of life. People with PD have a fairly normal life expectancy. However, the trajectory of the condition is such that there are many years during which the patient will need healthcare support and when demands will be placed on the health service. As such PD was an ideal topic for the guideline programme and NICE commissioned the National Collaborating Centre for Chronic Conditions (NCC-CC) to compile the first national evidence-based PD guideline. It took 18 months to develop and was published in 2006 (NCC-CC 2006).",

      "title": "Children and Adolescents Who Have Schizophrenia",
      "abstract": "Schizophrenia is a chronic disorder associated with deficits in cognition, affect, and social functioning. The onset of illness can occur rarely as early as 5 years of age, but after the age of 13 years, the incidence increases steadily.Early-onset (before age 18 y) and very early-onset (before age 13 y) schizophrenia are diagnosed by using the same criteria as in adults, and these forms appear to be continuous with the adult form of the disorder. Youths who have schizophrenia are predominantly males, have high rates of premorbid abnormalities and higher ratings on negative and positive symptoms, and often exhibit poor outcome.Schizophrenia is a phasic disorder, with individual variability. The phases are: According to the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria, at least two of the following symptoms should be present for a significant period of time during a 1-month period: Only one symptom is needed if the delusions are bizarre, hallucinations include a voice providing running commentary on the person’s behavior or thinking, or two or more voices are conversing with each other.Another criterion is the deterioration of social, occupational, and self-care functioning below the level achieved before onset. For children and adolescents, this includes the failure to achieve age-appropriate levels of interpersonal, academic, or occupational development. The disturbances also must be present for at least 6 months.Conditions in the differential diagnosis must be excluded, such as mood disorders (especially bipolar disorder), pervasive developmental disorders, nonpsychotic emotional and behavioral disturbances (including posttraumatic stress disorder), and organic conditions. The list of potential organic causes is vast and encompasses: seizure disorders, central nervous system lesions (eg, brain tumors, head trauma), neurodegenerative disorders (eg, Huntington chorea, lipid storage disorders), metabolic disorders (eg, endocrinopathies, Wilson disease), developmental disorders (eg, velocardiofacial syndrome), toxic encephalopathies (eg, abuse of substances such as amphetamines, cocaine hallucinogens, phencyclidine, alcohol, marijuana, and solvents; medications such as stimulants, corticosteroids, or anticholinergic agents; and other toxins such as heavy metals), and infectious diseases (eg, encephalitis, meningitis, or human immunodeficiency virus-related syndromes).Intoxication or withdrawal from drugs or alcohol can mimic nearly every psychiatric disorder, including mania, schizophrenia, or other psychotic disorders. Physiologic manifestations and urine drug screening are critical in diagnosing a substance-induced psychosis, but substance use disorders also are common among patients who have schizophrenia. As many as 50% of affected patients have a history of alcohol or illicit drug dependency. For this reason, urine drug screening is critical to evaluate the cause of psychotic exacerbation. If psychotic symptoms persist for more than 1 week after drug detoxification, a primary psychotic disorder is more likely.Laboratory and neuroimaging procedures are not helpful in diagnosing schizophrenia, but they are used to rule out other neurologic or medical problems. They should be justified on the basis of the clinical presentation and findings in either the history or the physical examination.Once the diagnosis is established, it needs to be reassessed longitudinally because misdiagnosis at the time of onset is common. Most children who have hallucinations do not have schizophrenia.The treatment of schizophrenia in children and adolescents combines psychopharmacologic agents and psychosocial interventions. Therapies vary, depending on the individual patient characteristics and the stage of the disorder. Both factors are specific for the symptomatology (positive and negative) of the disorder and general in relation to the psychological, social, educational, and cultural needs of the child and the family.Schizophrenia rarely occurs before age 13 years, but the onset increases steadily during adolescence, peaking between ages 15 and 30 years. It is believed to be a neurodevelopmental disorder; there is no evidence of causation from psychological or social factors. Adult schizophrenia is associated with perinatal complications, abnormal brain structure and size, minor physical anomalies, and disruption of fetal neural development (especially in the second trimester of gestation). Early developmental delays, including cognitive, language, and communication delays, and neurobiological abnormalities (deficits in smooth pursuit eye movements, autonomic responsivity, and neuroimaging findings) may be early manifestations of the disorder. Approximately 10% to 20% of children who have schizophrenia have intelligence quotients in the borderline to mentally retarded range. Outcome is predicted best by premorbid and cognitive functioning, negative symptoms, and behavioral problems. The risk of self-inflicted and unintentional injury related to psychotic thinking is high and is associated with high rates of mortality.Psychopharmacology includes traditional neuroleptics that block dopamine receptors and atypical antipsychotics that have a variety of effects, such as antagonism of serotonergic receptors. Psychoeducational therapy for patients and families include education about the illness and social skills training for the patient. Unfortunately, studies on the effectiveness of these interventions in children are limited.The Practice Parameter for the Assessment and Treatment of Children and Adolescents with Schizophrenia of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry referenced previously is important reading for care of these patients.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is typically well recognized by its characteristic motor symptoms (e.g., bradykinesia, rigidity, and tremor). The cognitive symptoms of PD are increasingly being acknowledged by clinicians and researchers alike. However, PD also involves a host of emotional and communicative changes which can cause major disruptions to social functioning. These incude problems producing emotional facial expressions (i.e., facial masking) and emotional speech (i.e., dysarthria), as well as difficulties recognizing the verbal and nonverbal emotional cues of others. These social symptoms of PD can result in severe negative social consequences, including stigma, dehumanization, and loneliness, which might affect quality of life to an even greater extent than more well-recognized motor or cognitive symptoms. It is, therefore, imperative that researchers and clinicans become aware of these potential social symptoms and their negative effects, in order to properly investigate and manage the socioemotional aspects of PD. This narrative review provides an examination of the current research surrounding some of the most common social symptoms of PD and their related social consequences and argues that proactively and adequately addressing these issues might improve disease outcomes.",

However, not all PD patients will develop psychosis, and a variety of factors, both intrinsic and extrinsic, contribute to its occurrence. Dopaminergic dysfunction plays an important role, along with the role of other neurotransmitters, such as acetylcholine and serotonin. Apart from dopaminergic and other medications, other reported risk factors include increased age, comorbidities, cognitive impairment, sleep disturbances, visual processing deficits, genetic predisposition and Lewy body distribution. While the specific course of PD psychosis remains to be adequately described, it seems clear that psychotic symptoms, once present, are persistent and distressing. Optimal management includes identification of contributing potential causes, optimization of the environment, antiparkinsonian medication adjustment, and symptomatic management with specific medications such as quetiapine and clozapine and, in those with cognitive impairment, cholinesterase inhibitors.",

      "abstract": "<b>Abstract:</b> Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a syndromic label for people with informant-corroborated memory problems and evidence of memory impairment on formal testing in the absence of more pervasive deficits in cognition and functional abilities. It is often described as a “risk factor” for dementia though this is misleading; patients with the first signs of Alzheimer9s disease (AD) will meet the criteria for MCI and as their illness progresses they will move to more traditional criteria for dementia (eg, DSM). Importantly though, they have not changed or “converted” from one disease to another. The problem with MCI clinically, and hence the reason why all such patients are not simply diagnosed with very mild AD is that as one moves closer to normal performance (ie, not clearly demented), the risk of patients who do not have AD (eg, so-called “worried well”; depression; alternate degenerative or non-degenerative pathology) being captured by the MCI syndrome increases. Furthermore, although the concept of MCI seems straightforward, “absence of dementia” or “intact cognition in domains other than memory” or even “objective evidence of memory impairment” varies according to the methods used to define each criterion. Nevertheless, with longitudinal follow-up to confirm that initial MCI status was due to incipient AD, this syndrome offers a important window to examine the earliest symptomatic stages of the disease. Emerging evidence from such studies have highlighted that incipient (MCI-stage) AD is underpinned by degeneration of an interconnected neural circuit including mesial temporal lobe, diencephalon and posterior cingulate regions—all of which, interestingly, have been implicated in memory processing from focal lesion studies in humans.",

The physician’s term for thinking, judgment, and memory is cognition. When impairment of cognition is substantial, irreversible, and interfering with activities of daily living, we term this dementia. Dementia may complicate otherwise typical PD, representing progression of the disease process. When this has been assessed in PD clinics, it is found in a minority of patients and usually late in the course. Thus, just because you have PD does not mean that you are destined to become demented. Moreover, not everyone with PD who complains of memory impairment is demented. There are other reasons why thinking and memory may be affected. Let’s consider this in more detail.",

Estas células son de gran importancia ya que llevan la información a los músculos del cuerpo. Debido a la degeneración de neuronas motoras piramidales en la corteza motora, neuronas del tallo cerebral y neuronas del asta anterior en la médula espinal inducen la aparición de enfermedades motoras que producen atrofia progresiva de los músculos. Así, cuando se dañan estas células nerviosas, se presentan diferentes enfermedades motoras “raras” como: la esclerosis lateral amiotrófica, la esclerosis lateral primaria, la atrofia muscular espinal, síndrome de Guillain-Barré, la atrofia muscular espinal-bulbar y el síndrome pospoliomielítico, entre otros. Las patologías motoras pueden tener un origen congénito, genético o ambiental (viral, por fármacos o esporádico). Aunque estas enfermedades motoras se consideran poco comunes, son de gran importancia ya que los pacientes no logran recuperarse por la progresión de la enfermedad, lo que conlleva al fallecimiento. Esta revisión, analiza una serie de estudios clínicos de los últimos 20 años en estas patologías motoras para comprender mejor su etiología, diagnóstico y tratamientos, como el uso de células madre en la producción de oligodendrocitos que producen mielina, el cual es un factor clave en las enfermedades motoras y la utilización de antioxidantes que pueden ser la clave para obtener resultados prometedores que tiene como objetivo mantener la esperanza de vida en los sujetos que las padecen.",

      "abstract": "Transcranial B-mode sonography (TCS) is a relatively new method which has been proven to be helpful in the diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease (PD). Due to the underlying physical principles, supplementary information to other neuroimaging methods can be derived. Substantia nigra (SN) hyperechogenicity is the characteristic feature of idiopathic PD, which can help in the differentiation of atypical parkinsonian syndromes like multiple system atrophy or progressive supranuclear palsy. Besides, the quick ‘look into the brain’ can easily visualize an enlargement of the ventricular system, alterations of the basal ganglia like increased contents of calcium or trace metals, or a missing brain stem raphe, typically seen in depressive disorders, and can therefore give further diagnostic hints for symptomatic parkinsonian syndromes. Many studies indicate that SN hyperechogenicity constitutes a stable marker, irrespective of the disease stage. In a prospective study of patients with very first signs of yet unclear parkinsonism, a high predictive value of TCS for the diagnosis of PD could be proven. Moreover, there is accumulating evidence that SN hyperechogenicity could play a role in the premotor diagnosis of PD. In this review, the additional diagnostic value of TCS in the early diagnosis of PD as well as limitations of the method are being discussed.",

      "title": "Clinical and Imaging Markers of Prodromal Parkinson's Disease",
      "abstract": "The diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) relies on the clinical effects of dopamine deficiency, including bradykinesia, rigidity and tremor, usually manifesting asymmetrically. Misdiagnosis is common, due to overlap of symptoms with other neurodegenerative disorders such as multiple system atrophy and progressive supranuclear palsy, and only autopsy can definitively confirm the disease. Motor deficits generally appear when 50-60% of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra are already lost, limiting the effectiveness of potential neuroprotective therapies. Today, we consider PD to be not just a movement disorder, but rather a complex syndrome non-motor symptoms (NMS) including disorders of sleep-wake cycle regulation, cognitive impairment, disorders of mood and affect, autonomic dysfunction, sensory symptoms and pain. Symptomatic LRRK2 mutation carriers share non-motor features with individuals with sporadic PD, including hyposmia, constipation, impaired color discrimination, depression, and sleep disturbance. Following the assumption that the pre-symptomatic gene mutation carriers will eventually exhibit clinical symptoms, their neuroimaging results can be extended to the pre-symptomatic stage of PD. The long latent phase of PD, termed prodromal-PD, represents an opportunity for early recognition of incipient PD. Early recognition could allow initiation of possible neuroprotective therapies at a stage when therapies might be most effective. The number of markers with the sufficient level of evidence to be included in the MDS research criteria for prodromal PD have increased during the last ten years. Here, we review the approach to prodromal PD, with an emphasis on clinical and imaging markers and report results from our neuroimaging study, a retrospective evaluation of a cohort of 39 participants who underwent DAT-SPECT scan as part of their follow up. The study was carried out to see if it was possible to detect subclinical signs in the preclinical (neurodegenerative processes have commenced, but there are no evident symptoms or signs) and prodromal (symptoms and signs are present, but are yet insufficient to define disease) stages of PD.",

      "title": "Birth transitions: Pathophysiology, the onset of consciousness and possible implications for neonatal maladjustment syndrome in the foal",
      "abstract": "Neonatal maladjustment syndrome (NMS), also known as hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy, perinatal asphyxia syndrome and neonatal encephalopathy 1, 2, is reportedly the most common problem observed in neonatal foals during the first 72 h after birth 2. Neurological signs of NMS can range from subtle to severe and may include convulsions/seizures, weakness and behavioural abnormalities 3. While in severe cases an early death is likely, recovery is possible with human intervention, especially in less severe cases 1, 4. Neonatal maladjustment syndrome is mainly attributed to cerebral hypoxia and ischaemia leading to neuronal cell death shortly before, during or after birth 1, 2, 4. Signs of central nervous system (CNS) disease in equine neonatal patients have been attributed to hypoxic encephalopathy in 92% of cases, of which 59% experienced dystocia or premature placental separation 5. Other possible causes may include post natal persistence of or reversion to an inhibited fetal state of cerebral cortical function 2 and meningitis, congenital lesions, CNS haemorrhage or oedema, metabolic insults, sepsis, endotoxins, and in utero infections 6. Thus, NMS appears to represent a number of different but related conditions that reflect untoward responses to the exceptional physiological challenges that precede, accompany and follow expulsion from the uterus at birth. In line with the distinction made by Aleman et al. 2, the focus of this editorial will be the impact of variations in the oxygen status of the foal 7 and their suggestion that a fetal state of inhibited cerebral cortical function may be retained or return after birth 2. Although the latter area is of more contemporary interest 2, 8, both merit consideration because their effects may interact. The first area relates to established pathophysiological causes of impaired perinatal oxygen status and its various impacts on metabolic and other processes that support neonatal heat production 7. The second area concerns less well-recognised changes in the physiological environment of the brain during the transition of the young from the intrauterine to the extrauterine environment, in particular the impact of that on post natal levels of arousal and the onset of consciousness 9-11. Hindrances to the successful completion of this transition in brain function would jeopardise the newborn's capacity to interact with its physical environment and mother in ways that otherwise promote its survival and well-being. Finally, in addition to emphasising the above 2 areas, consideration will be limited to mild cases of NMS where brain function is only temporarily affected and is therefore reversibly inhibited. The well demonstrated prenatal increase in fetal hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenocortical (HPA) activity is important for integrating 4 key processes. They are the onset of labour, an acceleration of fetal tissue maturation just before birth, the timely onset of colostrum/milk production by the mother, and a physiologically generated impetus to engage in mother–young bonding 12. All of these processes are crucial for neonatal survival, which is jeopardised if one or more of them is impaired. Moreover, superimposed on these processes may be negative impacts of pathophysiological and related conditions that arise as a result of placental insufficiency, intrapartum hypoxia, dystocia, premature birth, starvation of the newborn and maternal underfeeding. Each one of these has been discussed in detail elsewhere 7, 12, 13 and has been identified as relevant to some manifestations of NMS 1-4. Hypothermia is often observed shortly after outdoor births of ungulate young, is a common outcome of perinatal pathophysiology, may often be severe and predisposes the newborn to death or debility (Table 1). Importantly, in the context of managing impaired newborns, hypothermia of as little as 2–3°C is anticipated to result in some dulling of consciousness, and this in its turn may contribute to the reduced behavioural responsiveness of chilled newborns to their mothers 7. Hypothermia occurs in healthy vigorous newborns that mount full heat production responses to ambient cold that is so severe that heat loss still exceeds heat production. In contrast, hypoxia associated with placental insufficiency or dystocia can inhibit heat production sufficiently to cause hypothermia even at mild ambient temperatures. This inhibition is associated with various consequences of anaerobic metabolism as indicated by elevated concentrations of plasma lactate and hydrogen ions and evidence of metabolic and respiratory acidosis 14-16, and it is rarely associated with cerebral lesions 17, 18. The newborn may also be predisposed to hypothermia by immature shivering and nonshivering thermogenic mechanisms and/or by reduced energy reserves available to fuel heat production 13, 17, 19. Moreover, such immature newborns may be further disadvantaged by high rates of heat loss due to a high surface area to body weight ratio. Immaturity of other organ systems may also adversely affect their survival. Practically, however, normothermia can usually be restored and maintained by initially keeping most such newborns at air temperatures near the upper limit of their species-specific thermoneutral range 7, 12. Chronic fetal hypoxia Fetal undernutrition Fetal growth retardation Hypothermia Low birthweight Failure to suck due to weakness, competition, inadequate mothering Deficient production of colostrum/milk Hypoglycaemia Inhibited heat production Hypothermia in cold conditions Cerebral compromise in warm environments Infection Immature thermogenic mechanisms Reduced thyroidal and adrenocortical support of post natal metabolic activity Restricted placental size Fetal growth retardation Reduced deposition of fetal fat reserves Inadequate maternal udder development and colostrum/milk production Inhibition of or impaired heat production Excessive heat loss Hypoglycaemia Hypothermia Infection Energy-rich nutrients are required to fuel heat production and these are derived from body energy reserves deposited before birth and from colostrum/milk drunk after birth 19-21. Starvation or inadequate colostrum/milk intakes lead to hypoglycaemia as body energy reserves become depleted, and the onset of hypoglycaemia in such newborns may be more rapid in intensive care units because the warm conditions would usually inhibit shivering and its glucose-sparing effects 19. Severe hypoglycaemia in warm conditions will eventually lead to cerebral compromise as indicated by seizure activity, while in cold conditions it will inhibit heat production and usually lead to hypothermia 7, 19. In addition, it is well known that starvation deprives newborns of immunoglobulins and thus predisposes them to infections that can result in a variety of debilitating, often fatal, conditions 7. The routine intensive management of NMS foals is obviously directed at specifically minimising such problems. Interestingly, the volumes of colostrum required to meet the newborn's energy needs 19 will substantially exceed the minimum necessary to provide sufficient immunoglobulins for reasonable protection against many neonatal infections. As already mentioned, NMS is commonly associated with encephalopathy due to cerebral hypoxia and ischaemia shortly before, during or after birth. However, it has been suggested that in some mild cases of NMS, where a normal birth has apparently occurred and the NMS newborns have recovered quickly and fully from the condition, other factors may be at play 2. In particular these may include a post natal persistence of fetal physiological conditions linked to aberrant activity of the fetal HPA axis and/or elevated pregnane concentrations 2. This intriguing suggestion raises the possibility that factors other than hypoxia may impair or delay the onset of consciousness after birth of some NMS foals. If so, this would reduce their capacity to engage in survival-critical volitional behaviour, and this would be the case whether they were kept outdoors or indoors in a stall or a neonatal care unit. It also emphasises the value of developing interventions that would help caregivers to more effectively manage this transitional period in such foals. Integrated analyses of the literature suggest that ungulate fetuses, which are neurologically mature at birth, are actively maintained in sleep-like, unconscious states despite the fact that their brains have attained the capacity for conscious perception before birth 9-11, 22. Maintenance of such unconscious states is apparently due to the combined neuroinhibitory effects of high circulating and cerebral concentrations of adenosine, allopregnanolone, pregnanolone and prostaglandin D2 acting together with a placental neuroinhibitory peptide, warmth, buoyancy and cushioned tactile stimulation 9-11 (Table 2). Therefore, conscious perception is not anticipated to occur until shortly after birth in these species. Potent neuroinhibitor promoting sleep and unconsciousness Responds rapidly due to very short biological half-life Demonstrated inhibition of cerebral cortical electrical activity Placental and fetal tissues including the brain High circulating levels in fetus Production varies with fetal oxygen status – elevated in hypoxia, reduced in normoxia Allopregnanolone Pregnanolone Neuroactive steroidal metabolites of progesterone Act via GABAA receptors to bring about sedative/hypnotic and anaesthetic effects Produced by the fetal brain and the placenta from progesterone and cholesterol High circulating levels in fetus Elevated during stress and hypoxia Produced by the fetal brain Present in cerebrospinal fluid in fetal sheep during late pregnancy These observations raise the question of how the post natal onset of consciousness is achieved in healthy newborns. Key factors are considered to include a reduction in cerebral cortical inhibition by factors that are unique to life in utero, as well as to an increase in cerebral cortical activation associated with birth 9, 10. Thus, a marked elevation of tissue oxygen concentrations in response to the onset of successful breathing after birth and the loss of the placenta as a source of circulating adenosine are both considered to lead to a rapid decrease in circulating and cerebral adenosine concentrations and to a decrease in an overriding adenosine inhibition of cerebral cortical function 9. Loss of the placenta at birth would also contribute by removing a significant source of allopregnanolone, pregnanolone and their precursors, and the only source of the placental peptide neuroinhibitor. The rapid post natal removal of this neuroinhibition, especially that due to adenosine, is presumed to allow a suite of activators of cerebral cortical function to operate. The combined effect of these activators is presumed to be sufficient to overcome residual but declining inhibitory effects of the neuroactive steroids which persist for some time after the rapid decline in the overriding adenosine inhibition has occurred 9, 23. Activators of arousal observed in newborns include high circulating levels of 17β-oestradiol, which is mostly of placental origin, and stimulation of the locus coeruleus–noradrenaline system by strong intrapartum tactile stimulation and hypoxia and by post partum exposure to cold ambient conditions 24, 25. The neuroactive steroid 17β-oestradiol has rapid-onset excitatory effects in a variety of brain areas 26, 27. The locus coeruleus–noradrenaline system extends noradrenergic nerves widely throughout the brain and has major roles in stimulating arousal and alert vigilance 28. In addition, neurons of the locus coeruleus project to the olfactory bulb so that activation of this nucleus may facilitate teat-seeking and bonding in neonatal animals 29, 30. With the successful onset of breathing after birth, 17β-oestradiol and noradrenaline presumably act together with cold stimulation of cutaneous thermoreceptors, and with tactile stimulation through contact with hard surfaces and maternal licking, to promote the first appearance of consciousness 9, 10. Arousal is observed in the normal healthy newborn within minutes of birth and accompanies the onset of breathing 31. This is followed by volitional behaviours suggestive of some level of conscious perception, such as interactions with the dam, standing successfully and then teat seeking. Arousal and the associated onset of breathing are essential for survival; in their absence the newborn will rapidly become hypoxic/hypercapnic and die 31. In addition, behaviours of the newborn that contribute to mother–young bonding and help to secure adequate colostrum/milk intake are equally important when human intervention is not possible 7, 19. Behaviours associated with survival become possible by the time of birth in precocial young because their neurological apparatus has developed sufficiently to process sensory inputs from the environment, allowing them to find the dam and a teat, or even to seek shelter in cold conditions 31. Such behaviours, which may initially reflect innate drives, are indicative of arousal and the onset of consciousness. Factors associated with hypothermia that adversely affect this process and thereby threaten newborn survival include the pathophysiological states listed in Table 1. Relationships between these factors and associated key features of NMS foals have been summarised in Figure 1. Clearly, NMS foals are usually managed clinically in ways designed to minimise these problems 2. The point here, of course, is to clarify whether or not a possible delay in the progression from prenatal unconsciousness to post natal consciousness occurs independently of hypoxia in some NMS foals, a condition that would manifest functionally as retention of an inhibited state of fetal cerebral cortical activity as suggested by Aleman et al. 2. Such a demonstration is made somewhat more complex because persistent hypoxia also delays the usually rapid post natal reduction in adenosine inhibition of cerebral cortical activity 9, 11. Intersection between some key features of neonatal maladjustment syndrome (NMS) foals and hypoxia, hypothermia, starvation, hypoglycaemia and state of consciousness. See text for details. For example, many of the foals showing clinical signs of CNS impairment are likely to have experienced one or both of 2 forms of hypoxic insult. They are chronic hypoxia caused by placental insufficiency associated with a small placental size or other placental impairments that reduce its oxygen transfer capacity over an extended period, and acute hypoxia during birth resulting from dystocia and/or premature separation of the placenta. Interestingly, 12 of the 32 NMS foals observed by Aleman et al. 2 were reported to have had a clinical history of acute hypoxia of these types. Nevertheless, the aetiology of hypoxic influences on the state of consciousness and on commonly observed behaviour in NMS foals, such as lack of affinity for the mare, absence of sucking and weakness 4, is likely to be quite complex. This is because such influences probably involve at least 2 factors acting separately or together. First, where neonatal breathing is not compromised, persistent inhibitory effects of prepartum or intrapartum hypoxia on heat-producing mechanisms would often lead to hypothermia which has the capacity to dull consciousness due to its specific thermal effects on cerebral metabolic rate 7. Of course, providing sufficient thermal support to maintain normothermia would rule out this possibility. The second factor is a subtle involvement of hypoxia in some mild cases of NMS which appear to manifest as a post partum continuation of an inhibited fetal cerebral cortical status, or a reversion to such a state after apparently normal post natal arousal and activity have occurred 2. This might arise if respiratory function remained suboptimal from birth or if such suboptimal function appeared after a successful post partum onset of optimal function. In either case, the potent neuroinhibitory effects of adenosine and/or the pregnane steroid metabolites allopregnanolone and pregnanolone might be anticipated to persist straight after birth or return later, because their concentrations are reported to increase during hypoxia and other stressful situations 11, 32. If this did occur, such inhibition might override activation of cerebral cortical activity resulting from 17β-oestradiol, noradrenaline, strong tactile stimulation and, if thermal support is not provided, by cold exposure. This possibility could be ruled out and/or managed by continuous monitoring of oxygen status and, if required, by providing respiratory support. A third possibility, which accords with the proposal of Aleman et al. 2, is that a post natal persistence or return of a fetal state of cerebral cortical inhibition may occur in normoxic NMS foals. Of the 32 NMS foals in their study, there was no clinical history of hypoxia in 12. However, clarifying the aetiology of NMS in 6 of these was somewhat complicated by other clinically significant factors, whereas the remaining 6 foals apparently exhibited none 2. It is understood of course that heterogeneity of study groups is usual when they are made up of clinical cases acquired serendipitously. Nevertheless, taken as a whole, the group of 32 NMS foals provides interesting information 2. First, the plasma neuroactive steroid concentrations exhibited far greater ranges in the NMS foals than in healthy ones. This presumably reflected their heterogeneity and raises the possibility that some of the subgroups considered above might be found to have significantly different hormone profiles once they have been identified and studied in sufficient numbers. Second, progesterone, as a precursor of allopregnanolone and pregnanolone, has neuroinhibitory actions 8, 9, 11 and is therefore of particular interest here because, to the present authors' knowledge, none of the other steroids reported to be significantly elevated in NMS foals 2 have documented neuroinhibitory actions. The elevated plasma concentrations of progesterone are consistent with dulled consciousness 33-35, but the exceptionally low, and therefore unreported 2 concentrations of allopregnanolone are not. Third, although the mechanisms remain elusive at present 2, the significantly higher mean plasma concentrations of pregnenolone, androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone and epitestosterone, as well as progesterone, do indicate different patterns of steroidogenesis and/or clearance, and support the view of Aleman et al. 2 that after further investigation and validation such hormone profiles might become useful aids to diagnosing some types of NMS. Fourth, the behavioural evidence of cerebral cortical inhibition in NMS foals 2, considered in the context of an apparent requirement for the withdrawal of neuroinhibition to be accompanied by increasing neuroactivation if birth is to be followed by the timely onset of consciousness 9-11, raises the prospect of testing the therapeutic efficacy of potent neuroactivators in some NMS foals. One candidate is 17β-oestradiol because of evidence that it could promote behavioural arousal, breathing and subsequent survival in lambs that were initially 'flat' or inactive after delivery by hysterectomy close to the time of normal birth 36. Another candidate is the use of strong tactile stimulation to elicit locus coeruleus–noradrenaline mediated neuroactivation. A suggested way to achieve such tactile stimulation (J.E. Madigan, personal communication) is to use a modified soft rope 'squeeze' technique to simulate compression of the young by the cervix and vagina during birth 37, a natural process that is known to strongly stimulate the locus coeruleus 9, 11. It is apparent from these observations that the fresh perspectives provided by the notion that inhibited fetal states of cerebral cortical function may persist or return after birth in some NMS foals, as outlined by Aleman et al. 2, lays open several fruitful lines of investigation. In building on earlier insights into the onset of consciousness in other neurologically mature young shortly after an uneventful birth 9-11, 31, such investigations, as is usual in their early stages, are likely to constructively generate more interesting questions than they provide answers, but answers do eventually become clear. So, watch this space!",

It is under-diagnosed not only by general physicians but also by neurologists. The cause of PSP is not known. Exposure to toxins and viruses has been proposed in the aetiology of PSP without any concrete evidence. The features of PSP resemble those of Parkinson's disease and the two diseases are often confused. Corticobasal degeneration and multisystem atrophy are other differential diagnoses. Despite certain common features with Parkinson's disease, corticobasal degeneration, and mutisystem atrophy, there are important differences that help to differentiate it from these disorders.",

      "title": "Primary lateral sclerosis mimicking atypical parkinsonism",
      "abstract": "Abstract Primary lateral sclerosis (PLS), the upper motor neurone variant of motor neurone disease, is characterized by progressive spinal or bulbar spasticity with minimal motor weakness. Rarely, PLS may present with clinical features resembling parkinsonism resulting in occasional misdiagnosis as one of the atypical parkinsonian syndromes. Here we describe five patients initially referred with a diagnosis of levodopa‐unresponsive atypical parkinsonism (n = 4) or primary progressive multiple sclerosis (n = 1), but subsequently found to have features consistent with PLS instead. Onset age varied from 49 to 67 years. Unilateral limb slowness or clumsiness was the initial complaint in four, and bulbar symptoms in one. Repeated finger/foot tapping was slow in all five, but without fatiguing or decrement. Spasticity with hyperreflexia, exaggerated jaw jerk and extensor plantar responses were eventually seen in all patients. Anterior horn cell involvement developed in three cases. Early gait disturbances resulting in falls were seen in all patients and none of them responded to dopaminergic medications. Two patients underwent dopamine transporter (DaT) SPECT scanning with normal results. Other features included emotional lability (n = 5) and cognitive impairment involving frontal subcortical systems (n = 1). In conclusion, these cases represent a subgroup of PLS patients in whom pyramidal slowness may be mistaken for akinesia, and spasticity misconstrued as rigidity, leading to an erroneous diagnosis of atypical parkinsonism. However, the absence of fatiguing and decrement on repeated finger/foot tapping should help to distinguish these patients from the true atypical parkinsonian syndromes. © 2007 Movement Disorder Society",

      "abstract": "CONTEXTO: A doença de Parkinson (DP) é uma moléstia progressiva de causa desconhecida, com características motoras que incluem tremor de repouso, rigidez, bradicinesia e alterações posturais. Mas o comprometimento cognitivo é comum mesmo nos indivíduos não dementes. Somando-se a isso, a DP associa-se a um aumento de risco de desenvolver demência. OBJETIVOS: Esta revisão analisa a perda cognitiva associada à DP, sobre seus aspectos, fatores de risco, fisiopatologia e tratamento. MÉTODOS: Esta revisão incorporou artigos obtidos pelo Medline. RESULTADOS: Pacientes com DP, com ou sem demência, têm desempenho reduzido em vários testes cognitivos. Essa redução cognitiva pode ser atribuída à disfunção dos circuitos conectores da região frontal aos núcleos da base. Distúrbio cognitivo leve pode progredir para demência em certos pacientes. Identificaram-se alguns fatores de risco para o desenvolvimento de demência e revelaram-se aspectos sobre a fisiopatologia. CONCLUSÃO: As características neuropsicológicas da DP, as quais refletem predominantemente disfunção frontal, podem ser atribuídas a anormalidades do circuito fronto-estriatal. Mas a fisiopatologia responsável pela demência associada à DP não está completamente compreendida. Anticolinesterásicos e memantina têm um modesto efeito contra sintomas cognitivos. Detecção precoce dos fatores de risco para o desenvolvimento de demência pode ajudar a criar estratégias preventivas.",

It has been termed as advanced, late-stage, end-stage, and even palliative PD [1–3]. As the term late-stage PD has become the most widespread, it will be used henceforth. The criteria for diagnosing late-stage PD too has varied, with initial literature using varying cut-offs of the Hoehn and Yahr (H&Y) staging to determine the degree of advancement [1–3]. There has been significant criticism to this approach; it was asserted that while H & Y is heavily weighted towards postural instability and lower limb problems, it may overlook other motor symptoms that contribute to the advancing state, and it excludes non-motor symptoms (NMS). It was also written with the assumption that severity of PD is most related to motor symptoms [4].",

      "abstract": "Aux signes classiques constituant la « triade parkinsonienne » : akinesie, rigidite et tremblement de repos, s'associent egalement progressivement troubles de la marche, dysarthrie et instabilite posturale. Les troubles axiaux constituent un ecueil majeur et inevitable dans la prise en charge des patients parkinsoniens ; apres 5 ans d'evolution, 50 % des patients rapportent la survenue d'enrayages cinetiques (« freezing »), definis par un arret involontaire de la marche, brutal, pouvant survenir au demarrage, lors du demi-tour ou du franchissement d'un obstacle. Ces episodes sont parfois precedes d'episodes de « festination » de la marche, au cours desquels le sujet, marchant a petits pas de plus en plus rapides, semble « courir derriere son centre de gravite ». Freezing et festination sont responsables de chutes et d'une perte d'autonomie invalidante. Les freezing doparesistants constituent une contre indication a un geste de stimulation haute frequence des noyaux subthalamiques (NST). L'objectif de ce travail etait de mieux connaitre l incidence des troubles axiaux et l'impact de la stimulation cerebrale profonde sur les troubles de la marche dans la maladie de Parkinson (MP) evoluee. Dans un premier temps, nous avons realise une analyse phenomenologique du phenomene de festination orofaciale, observee chez 45 % des patients parkinsoniens apres 10 ans d'evolution, non correlee a la severite de la dysarthrie mais hautement avec la presence de freezing et festination de la marche, temoignant d'une physiopathologie commune. Nous avons ensuite analyse les parametres cinematiques de marche avant un episode de freezing chez 10 patients parkinsoniens evolues. En imposant des conditions de vitesse et de cadences aux sujets, calculees a partir de leurs parametres de marche spontanee, nous avons mis en evidence une influence preponderante des cadences elevees sur le declenchement du freezing dans une population predisposee, sans lien avec la variabilite des parametres de marche, suggerant une approche possible en terme de reeducation de ce symptome. Enfin, nous avons etudie l'impact de la stimulation cerebrale profonde sur les troubles de la marche et le freezing, apres 5 ans de chirurgie. En effet, dans une proportion variant de 5 a 15 % selon les cohortes, une aggravation des troubles de la marche a ete constatee chez les patients parkinsoniens, cela pouvant etre relie a l'evolution naturelle de la maladie (lesions non dopaminergiques), mais l'impact de la stimulation cerebrale profonde sur ces troubles n'avait jamais ete etudie. Sous stimulation du NST, le controle optimal des symptomes est habituellement obtenu avec un voltage moyen de 3 (± 0,4) V et une frequence moyenne ≥ 130 (± 19) Hz. Au cours des reglages proposes apres chirurgie du NST, voltage et frequence sont les parametres les plus frequemment modifies pour tenter d'optimiser le controle des symptomes moteurs de la maladie de Parkinson, avec une tendance naturelle a augmenter l'amplitude de stimulation au fil du temps, et parfois la frequence, notamment en cas de tremblement. Certaines combinaisons voltage / frequence, efficaces initialement, semblent s'averer secondairement deletere sur le freezing et les troubles de la marche pour certains patients. Nous avons demontre une aggravation significative des parametres de marche et du freezing sous combinaison 130 Hz, voltages usuels, tandis qu'une amelioration a pu etre obtenu grâce a une combinaison de frequence intermediaire, 60 Hz, avec un voltage plus eleve (5 V en moyenne). Ces resultats incitent a proposer une nouvelle strategie de reglages chez les patients parkinsoniens presentant des troubles de la marche et un freezing sous stimulation NST",

      "abstract": "Here's how my version of Webster's dictionary defines these terms: * Disease: A particular distinctive process in the body with a specific cause and characteristic symptoms. * Disorder: Irregularity, disturbance, or interruption of normal functions. * Syndrome: A number of symptoms occurring together and characterizing a specific disease. Let's consider 4 facts that may be relevant for this decision. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Probably not 'diseases' No objective laboratory test can differentiate 1 psychiatric malady from another, and this lack of specificity casts doubt on the disease model. However, many documented perturbations of normal brain functions are consistent with a disorder paradigm. Symptom overlap The signs and symptoms of psychiatric ailments overlap considerably. Depression and anxiety share many symptoms and frequently co-occur. Bipolar mania and schizophrenia share psychotic features, cognitive deficits, agitation, suicidality, aggressive behavior, etc. The obsessions of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) resemble and sometimes morph into the fixed false beliefs (delusions) of psychosis, and OCD's compulsions often characterize the behaviors of other psychiatric disorders, such as anorexia or bulimia nervosa. Personality disorder features essentially are attenuated but enduring forms of Axis I conditions. Nearly all psychiatric illnesses have some degree of suicidality, insomnia, and addictive behavior. Posttraumatic stress disorder's symptoms recapitulate those of numerous diagnostic categories, such as anxiety, depression, psychosis, negative symptoms, mania, OCD, impulsive behavior, and personality changes. Common neurobiology Most diagnostic categories in psychiatry share some neurobiologic features, such as: * neurotransmitter pathways (serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine, or glutamate) * structural abnormalities on neuroimaging (cortical atrophy, ventriculomegaly, gray and/or white matter abnormalities) or * genetic predispositions. Medical and psychiatric comorbidities (migraine, chronic pain, diabetes, obesity, alcohol abuse, anxiety, eating disorders, and Axis II features) occur across all major psychiatric diagnoses. Nonspecific medications Psychotropics approved for treating 1 condition are frequently useful for others: * Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors initially were indicated for depression but soon were found to have efficacy for panic attacks, social phobia, OCD, bulimia, impulse dyscontrol, and fibromyalgia. …",

      "title": "Perinatal risk factors for schizophrenia: Diagnostic specificity and relationships with maternal psychopathology",
      "abstract": "Abstract Although a growing body of evidence supports the hypothesis that exposure to obstetric complications (OCs) increases the vulnerability for schizophrenia, some questions remain unanswered regarding the diagnostic specificity and the etiological significance of this association. Associations with a history of OCs have been reported for other severe psychiatric disorders, such as autism, anorexia nervosa, or psychotic affective disorder. Thus, OCs may increase in a relatively non‐specific way the vulnerability for a range of severe mental disorders, the expression of this vulnerability depending on the interaction between OCs and other risk factors, such as the genetic liability for specific psychiatric disorder, or exposure to later environmental risk factors. The causal pathway between OCs, maternal psychopathology, and psychotic outcome in the offspring is not fully elucidated. The directions of the associations are often bi‐directional, and the mediating variables, if any, are not clearly identified. OCs may have a direct negative impact on fetal brain development, may be on the causal pathway between prepartum maternal depression/exposure to stress and increased risk of schizophrenia, or may indirectly increase the risk of child's later psychiatric disorder by acting as risk factors for maternal postpartum depression. The links and possible interactions between somatic perinatal risk factors and maternal psychopathology in the association with offspring's increased vulnerability for psychosis have to be further explored. © 2002 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.",

      "title": "Usp14 down-regulation corrects sleep and circadian dysfunction of a Drosophila model of Parkinson’s disease",
      "abstract": "PD is a complex, multifactorial neurodegenerative disease, which occurs sporadically in aged population, with some genetically linked cases. Patients develop a very obvious locomotor phenotype, with symptoms such as bradykinesia, resting tremor, muscular rigidity, and postural instability. At the cellular level, PD pathology is characterized by the presence of intracytoplasmic neurotoxic aggregates of misfolded proteins and dysfunctional organelles, resulting from failure in mechanisms of proteostasis. Nonmotor symptoms, such as constipation and olfactory deficits, are also very common in PD. They include alteration in the circadian clock, and defects in the sleep-wake cycle, which is controlled by the clock. These non-motor symptoms precede the onset of the motor symptoms by many years, offering a window of therapeutic intervention that could delay-or even prevent-the progression of the disease. The mechanistic link between aberrant circadian rhythms and neurodegeneration in PD is not fully understood, although proposed underlying mechanisms include alterations in protein homeostasis (proteostasis), which can impact protein levels of core components of the clock. Loss of proteostasis depends on the progressive pathological decline in the proteolytic activity of two major degradative systems, the ubiquitin-proteasome and the lysosome-autophagy systems, which is exacerbated in age-dependent neurodegenerative conditions like PD. Accordingly, it is known that promoting proteasome or autophagy activity increases lifespan, and rescues the pathological phenotype of animal models of neurodegeneration, presumably by enhancing the degradation of misfolded proteins and dysfunctional organelles, which are known to accumulate in these models, and to induce intracellular damage. We can enhance proteostasis by pharmacologically inhibiting or down-regulating Usp14, a proteasome-associated deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB). In a previous work, we showed that inhibition of Usp14 enhances the activity of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), autophagy and mitophagy, and abolishes motor symptoms of two well-established fly models of PD that accumulate dysfunctional mitochondria. In this work we extended the evidence on the protective effect of Usp14 down-regulation, and investigated the beneficial effect of down-regulating Usp14 in a Pink1 Drosophila model of PD that develop circadian and sleep dysfunction. We show that down-regulation of Usp14 ameliorates sleep disturbances and circadian defects that are associated to Pink1 KO flies.",

      "abstract": "This review deals with the range of neuropsychiatric problems that may arise from the use of medical and surgical therapies in the treatment of Parkinson’s disease. As new approaches emerge, these problems are diversifying. Well-recognized drug-related complications include hallucinations and psychosis and the so-called dopamine-dysregulation syndrome. The etiology of these problems has not been fully established and is not clearly dose related, while the management can be difficult and needs to be tailored to the individual patient. Cholinergic and dopaminergic drugs may both influence cognitive function. The development of pharmacogenetics could improve the therapeutic ratio of medical approaches to PD in the future. The literature relating to the neuropsychiatric issues complicating the surgical treatment of Parkinson’s disease is more recent and frequently suffers from methodological problems, lack of a systematic approach, and adequate patient follow-up. The emergence of neuropsychiatric problems in association with surgery has shed new light upon the pathophysiological mechanisms underpinning these symptoms. Depression, hypo-mania, euphoria, mirth, and hypersexuality have all been described following deep brain stimulation procedures, although most studies have concentrated upon the depressive features. Anxiety has been described only rarely to date. Fortunately, permanent cognitive complications appear to be rare. The optimal management approach for surgically related neuropsychiatric problems is unknown at present. Prospective multicenter studies would contribute significantly to resolving this therapeutic uncertainty. ( J Geriatr Psychiatry Neurol 2004; 17:172-180)",

We report four cases beginning during the postpartum period and discuss the potential contribution of different factors that may influence the occurrence of Parkinson disease in this time period. CASES: Four women aged 29–35 years developed arm tremor, shoulder pain, dizziness, or decreased dexterity of the hand in the first few days or months after childbirth. They were initially diagnosed with postpartum depression or psychogenic parkinsonism. Finally, dopamine transporter imaging confirmed the diagnosis of young-onset Parkinson disease. CONCLUSION: Early-onset Parkinson disease may present in postpartum women. In women with atypical motor symptoms in addition to depression, this diagnosis should be considered.",

More severe cognitive dysfunctions have been reported in PD patients who exhibited tremor at the onset of the illness in contrast with those of the acinetic/ rigid subgroup; however, this point has not been cleared up yet. With the aim of studying the cognitive state of PD patients, a sample of PD idiopatic individuals was selected. The inclusion criteria which they had to comply with included an evolution of the disease inferior to 4 years and no cognitive damage for various causes. A battery of neuropsychological tests was used (Minimental Parkinson, Signoret, Stroop, Trail Making Test, Frontal Assessment Batery, Syndrom Kurztest Complex Figure of Rey), and some scale to classify patients as Rigid or Trembling were utilized (UPDRS, Hoehn & Yars). Considering also their functional status both groups presented a specific episodic immediate memory failure, worse in Trembling, a great Stroop effect, normal visuospatial and executive faculties and “Slight indication of organic mental disorder” (Syndrom Kurztest), without significant differences between them. No relationship was found between the functional stage, and the cognitive functions except for the A part of the Trail Making Test which proved a difference through the years. The early episodic memory deterioration founded without executive and visuospatial functions failure, although with that tendency, is remarkable.",

Additionally, most patients with PD experience sleep-related symptoms, including difficulty in initiating and maintaining sleep, excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), and parasomnias such as rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (Kumar et al. 2002; Brotini and Gigli 2004; Postuma et al. 2009). Most studies point out that the prevalence of sleep disturbance in PD is nearly 100% (Lees et al. 1988; Kumar et al. 2002; Poryazova and Zacchariev 2005). These sleep disorders are classified as primary sleep disorders that are intrinsic to PD and secondary sleep disorders due to either medications or motor impairment (Friedman and Chou 2004). Most studies have shown that the use of dopamine (DA) agonists cause somnolence with a reversal of the sleep–wake cycle (Ondo et al. 2001; Sanjiv et al. 2001). CONTENTS",

Multiphase random changepoint regressions were used to time the onset and offset of symptom profiles. Profiles of longitudinal decline indicated that dementia associated with Parkinson's disease is preceded by subtle visuospatial deficits occurring at least 3 years prior to diagnosis and several years earlier than AD. Longitudinal indices of visuospatial ability indicated that individuals with Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) experienced accelerating declined after the onset of initial symptoms.

      "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder which leads to a progressive disability. The loss of dopaminergic neurons and disturbances in their connections cause deficient signaling of dopamine circuits, which results in motor and non-motor symptoms. Cognitive and behavioral disturbances are also common, including the possible onset of psychotic symptoms. Data on the prevalence of psychosis, caused by Parkinson’s disease is limited, as diagnostic criteria are not universally applied. Modified NINDS (National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke) criteria can be used. Several scales have been developed to assess the risk of psychosis development, to confirm the diagnosis, and to evaluate the symptom severity. For reliable diagnosis, it is advisable to use multiple scales, considering individual patient symptoms and differential diagnoses. Pharmacological treatment may include antipsychotics (quetiapine, clozapine), dopamine D2 receptor antagonists, 5-HT2A receptor ligands, medications for dementia, anxiolytics, antidepressants, and gabapentin. Non-pharmacological treatment may include electroconvulsive therapy, deep brain stimulation, and transcranial direct current stimulation. Use of treatment algorithms is recommended. Further research is necessary to discover new drugs specifically targeting the treatment of this disorder. Although Lithuania does not yet provide access to Pimavanserin, a drug specifically indicated for psychosis associated with Parkinson’s disease, other treatments can be recommended for patients, along with psychological counseling and collaboration with psychiatrists and psychologists.",

Cette maladie entraine des modifications cerebrales (e.g. perte de la substance blanche, volume du cortex anterieur) qui sont associees aux troubles moteurs et cognitifs pouvant apparaitre des les premieres annees de la maladie. Ceux-ci peuvent avoir des retentissements sur certaines activites de la vie quotidienne, comme la marche, pouvant conduire a un risque de chute important. Les consequences d'une chute, en termes de vie sociale, de traumatismes psychologiques, de mobilite et de qualite de vie sont majeures. Pour pouvoir prevenir ce risque, il importe de mieux comprendre les facteurs (e.g. cognitifs, neurophysiologiques) les plus predictifs d'une marche degradee chez des personnes atteintes de la MP. En particulier, un deficit au niveau des fonctions executives peut perturber la marche. Au niveau cerebral, les fonctions executives relevent notamment du cortex prefrontal dorsolateral (CPFDL). L'objectif de cette recherche preliminaire est d'etudier l'activite cerebrale au niveau du CPFDL pendant la marche chez des personnes atteintes de la maladie de Parkinson par rapport a des personnes âgees, sans troubles neurologiques. A ce jour, 10 personnes atteintes de la maladie de Parkinson et 10 personnes âgees ont participe a cette etude dans laquelle une batterie de tests neuropsychologiques a ete proposee pour mesurer les fonctions cognitives des participants. Ils ont egalement realise une tâche de marche comprenant 3 conditions : (1) marche simple (2) soustraction en position debout (3) double tâche (marcher et soustraire en meme temps). Lors de ces conditions, les participants etaient equipes de la spectroscopie proche infrarouge fonctionnelle (fNIRS) portable qui mesurait les changements de concentration en hemoglobine oxygenee (?HbO2) pendant la tâche (une augmentation de ?HbO2 signifie une plus forte activite cognitive). Des capteurs enregistraient differents parametres de marche tels que la vitesse de marche, la cadence et la longueur d'enjambee. Une augmentation de l'activite corticale au niveau du CPFDL est attendue, meme dans une tâche de marche seule chez les patients comparativement aux personnes âgees. Les resultats, en cours d'analyse, nous permettront de mieux comprendre les changements au niveau de l'activite corticale pendant la marche et les relations entre l'activite corticale du CPFDL et les performances comportementales (tâches cognitives et tâche de marche) chez des personnes atteintes de la maladie de Parkinson. A terme, ces resultats pourraient etre utiles pour identifier au plus tot des troubles de la marche et proposer une prise en charge de la maladie de Parkinson plus precocement.",

      "abstract": "Motor impairment, clinically defined as bradycinesia has been considered as resulting only from motor system problems. Combined analysis of cognitive function and dynamic characteristics was studied in 20 patients with Parkinson's disease by a simple aiming task on visuomotor performance system. The dynamic characteristics in a Parkinson's disease patient was evaluated by two parameters: decreased amplitude of the voluntary movement (=low gain constant) and delayed initiation of voluntary movement (=long reaction time). The visual event-related potential elicited in a target detection paradigm (P300 component) was recorded in 12 patients with Parkinson's disease. P300 latency was significantly prolonged in the patient group than in the normal control group (p<0.05). P300 has been shown to be intimately related to the cognitive process in the human brain and might well serve as a tool to monitor and evaluate the cognitive state in a clinical situation. The main cause of cognitive involvement in Parkinson's disease may include coexisting dementia and defective motivation. This type of cognitive disturbance may also serve partly as a cause of bradycinesia.",

[1-3]\n\nFor the clinician, it is often difficult to arrive at a reliable diagnosis of the neurologic syndrome and to detect the underlying tumor. Neurologic signs and symptoms, although often stereotypic, are not specific. In two-thirds of cases the underlying tumor is not discovered until after the first neurologic symptoms. [4] Furthermore, the neoplasm may be small and difficult to detect. [5-7] PNS are frequently associated with serum autoantibodies reactive with neuronal antigens that are also present in the underlying tumor. These antibodies include (1) the anti-Yo antibody, also called type 1 anti-Purkinje cell antibody (PCA-1), APCA-1, or type I antibody; (2) the anti-Hu antibody, also called type 1 anti-neuronal nuclear antibody (ANNA-1) or type IIa antibody; and (3) the anti-Ri antibody, also called type 2 anti-neuronal nuclear antibody (ANNA-2) or type IIb antibody Table 1. A clinical diagnosis of PNS is supported by the finding of these specific anti-neuronal antibodies. The detection of these antibodies should also lead to a focused search for specific underlying neoplasms. [8-12]\n\n\n\nView this table:\n\nTable 1.

Brain damage: Damage to the brain, especially damage to areas responsible for balance control, such as the brain stem, cerebral cortex, and cerebellum, can cause imbalances. Nervous system problems: Nervous system problems can cause imbalances by causing problems in communicating with your body’s sensory information and motor functions. Medication side effects: Some medications can cause symptoms such as dizziness or unsteadiness as a side effect. Eye disorders: Visual disturbances, especially problems with coordination between the eyes or damage to the retina, can cause imbalances.

Shortening of reaction time was obtained by giving a warning signal to a greater extent in cases with severer motor disability. The results suggest that inattention, one of several symptoms common to lesions in the frontal lobe and Parkinson's disease, may be a factor in bradykinesia in purposive movements in the disease. The Wisconsin card sorting test and criterion shift task which we devised to deal with a single category revealed that parkinsonian patients have difficulty in dealing with multiple sets simultaneously, which may be caused also by inattention. In execution of ballistic movement in parkinsonian patients, only a small torque constant in amount and in time can be produced in the beginning, irrespective of the size of force required, and subsequently enough force is built up to reach the target. This was more marked in cases with severe motor disability and in cases with decrease in power. Rigidity, mechanical properties of the limb or disorders in ocular movement were not responsible for the production of the initial small torque. Oculo-manual incoordination in visuomotor tracking tasks is also discussed.",

Freezing can occur on turning, in narrow spaces, immediately before reaching a destination, and in stressful situations. Dual tasking (motor or cognitive load) aggravates the problem. Freezing of gait in Parkinson9s disease usually occurs in the 'off' rather than in the 'on' state. It is, therefore, not entirely drug-resistant; the first step in medical treatment is to ensure adequate dopaminergic stimulation to reduce the 'off' state. There is no good evidence for any specific drug to alleviate freezing. Visual or auditory cues are very helpful as behavioural therapy. Assistive devices, such as a wheeled walker sometimes help. Deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus may alleviate freezing in the 'off' state. Because of the complexity of freezing, individual patients need a careful assessment—particularly in relation to motor fluctuation—to optimise their treatment.",

      "title": "Origin of Fatigue in Multiple Sclerosis: Review of the Literature",
      "abstract": "Fatigue is one of the most common and most disabling symptoms of multiple sclerosis (MS). Although numerous studies have tried to reveal it, no definite pathogenesis factor behind this fatigue has been identified. Fatigue may be directly related to the disease mechanisms (primary fatigue) or may be secondary to non—disease-specific factors. Primary fatigue may be the result of inflammation, demyelination, or axonal loss. A suggested functional cortical reorganization may result in a higher energy demand in certain brain areas, culminating in an increase of fatigue perception. Higher levels of some immune markers were found in patients with MS-related fatigue, whereas other studies rejected this hypothesis. There may be a disturbance in the neuroendocrine system related to fatigue, but it is not clear whether this is either the result of the interaction with immune activation or the trigger of this process. Fatigue may be secondary to sleep problems, which are frequently present in MS and in their turn result from urinary problems, spasms, pain, or anxiety. Pharmacologic treatment of MS (symptoms) may also provoke fatigue. The evidence for reduced activity as a cause of secondary fatigue in MS is inconsistent. Psychological functioning may at least play a role in the persistence of fatigue. Research did not reach consensus about the association of fatigue with clinical or demographic variables, such as age, gender, disability, type of MS, education level, and disease duration. In conclusion, it is more likely to explain fatigue from a multifactor perspective than to ascribe it to one mechanism. The current evidence on the pathogenesis of primary and secondary fatigue in MS is limited by inconsistency in defining specific aspects of the concept fatigue, by the lack of appropriate assessment tools, and by the use of heterogeneous samples. Future research should overcome these limitations and also include longitudinal designs.",

      "abstract": "Abstract By definition, aphasia is the result of brain damage; therefore, a neuropathology of aphasia exists. Both the type of pathology and the location of the brain lesion are significant to the clinicians caring for an aphasic patient. Techniques that demonstrate lesion type and site are crucial to the neuropathology of aphasia. Several generalizations can be offered (Benson, 1979a): Aphasia is produced lry damage to brain structures. Neuropathological pro cesses that involve nonbrain portions of the nervous system (e.g., cranial nerves) and secondary neurological dysfunctions such as systemic or psychogenic disorders do not produce aphasic language syndromes. Metabolic and toxic disorders (e.g., hepatic encephalopathy) produce a broad, overall disruption of brain function, not a focal aphasia. Also, because language loss, by definition, is a requirement for aphasia, congenital and developmental disorders in which language failed to develop cannot be considered sources of aphasia.",

      "abstract": "45,XO/46,XX mosaicism is associated with Turner syndrome and is rarely associated with serious abnormalities of brain structure or malformation of cortical development.1,2 In addition, individuals with Turner syndrome are reported to display less mental illness.3,4 We report herein a case of 45,XO/46′XX mosaicism without typical Turner syndrome symptoms but with psychotic symptoms, epilepsy, mental retardation, and brain malformation resembling lissencephaly. Ms A is a 63-year-old woman with a history of intractable epilepsy, psychotic symptoms, and mental retardation. She had her first seizure at the age of 10. From the age of 14 years onwards, she had repeated complex partial seizures. At the age of 20, she experienced her first psychotic symptoms. She was hospitalized 11 times because of her refractory psychotic symptoms and repeated seizures, and responded poorly to antipsychotic and anticonvulsant medication. She had a normal reproductive lifespan and delivered a daughter. During the latest admission, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain revealed noticeable frontal and temporal lobe atrophy and an asymmetric irregular gyral pattern. An absence of gyri, which is suggestive of lissencephaly, was noted dominantly in the left frontal and temporal lobe. Several interictal electroencephalogram recordings showed spikes localized on the bilateral fronto-temporal region, especially F3 and T5. Peripheral blood cells were analyzed using standardized cytogenetic methods. Of 30 peripheral blood mononuclear cells examined, eight were of the karyotype 45,XO and 22 were 46XX. We hypothesize that this chromosomal abnormality could explain the brain abnormality. Early this year, X chromosome-linked, aristaless-related, homeobox gene (ARX) was found to be associated with X-linked mental retardation, epilepsy and lissencephaly.5 We then investigated a mutation of ARX molecule in the present case. Mutation of ARX, however, was not detected in the present patient. For analysis of ARX, we obtained written informed consent. This study was approved by the Ethical Cornmittee of Shizuoka Prefectural Mental Care ard Rehabilitation Center. There have been very few reports that mention the relationship between Turner syndrome and psychiatric symptoms.4 Two reports have mentioned a case resembling the present one.1,2 Both of those patients had epilepsy, mental retardation, and lissencephaly. Neither of those patients, however, was reported to present psychotic symptoms. Further cases resembling the present one should provide insight into these types of patients.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is characterized by motor and nonmotor (cognitive and limbic) deficits. The motor signs of PD include hypokinetic signs such as akinesia/bradykinesia, rigidity and loss of normal postural reflexes, and hyperkinetic signs such as tremor. Dopamine depletion in the striatum is the hallmark of PD and of its animal models, still the pathophysiology of the parkinsonian symptoms and especially of parkinsonian tremor are under debate. The most extreme hypotheses argue about peripheral versus central nervous system origin, intrinsic cellular oscillator versus network oscillators, and basal ganglia-based pathophysiology versus cerebellar–thalamic based pathophysiology. Recent studies support the view that parkinsonian symptoms are most likely due to abnormal synchronous oscillating neuronal activity within the basal ganglia. Peripheral factors do only play a minor role for the generation, maintenance, and modulation of PD tremor and other signs. The most likely candidates producing these neuronal oscillations are the weakly coupled neural networks of the basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loops. However, the present evidence supports the view that the basal ganglia loops are influenced by other neuronal structures and systems and that the tuning of these loops by cerebello–thalamic mechanisms and by other modulator neurotransmitter systems entrain the abnormal synchronized oscillations. Neurosurgical procedures, such as lesions or high-frequency stimulation of different parts of the loop, might resume the normal unsynchronized activity of the basal ganglia circuitry, and, therefore, ameliorate the clinical symptoms of Parkinson's disease. © 2002 Movement Disorder Society",

PURA-related neurodevelopmental disorders include PURA syndrome, caused by a heterozygous pathogenic sequence variant in PURA, and 5q31.3 deletion syndrome, caused by a genomic 5q31.3 deletion encompassing all or part of PURA. PURA-related neurodevelopmental disorders are characterized by moderate to severe neurodevelopmental delay with absence of speech in most and lack of independent ambulation in many. Early-onset problems can include hypotonia, hypothermia, hypersomnolence, feeding difficulties, excessive hiccups, recurrent central and obstructive apneas, epileptic seizures, abnormal non-epileptic movements (dystonia, dyskinesia, and dysconjugate eye movements), and abnormal vision. Congenital heart defects, urogenital malformations, skeletal abnormalities, and endocrine disorders occur, but are less common. Diagnosis/testing. The diagnosis of a PURA-related neurodevelopmental disorder is established in a proband with either a heterozygous PURA pathogenic sequence variant (90% of affected individuals) or a non-recurrent deletion of 5q31.3 that encompasses all or part of PURA (10%). Management. Treatment of manifestations: Ongoing routine care by a multidisciplinary team. Treatment and/or therapy for developmental delays; neurologic findings (hypotonia, seizures, abnormal movements); feeding difficulties; apnea; visual impairment; and malformations of the heart, urogenital tract, and skeleton. Surveillance: Long-term follow up to assess psychomotor development, seizures or suspected seizures, vision, feeding for dysphagia, and musculoskeletal complications (hip dysplasia and scoliosis). Genetic counseling. PURA-related neurodevelopmental disorders, caused by either a heterozygous PURA pathogenic sequence variant or a 5q31.3 deletion encompassing all or part of PURA are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. In almost all probands with a PURA pathogenic sequence variant the sequence variant is de novo; to date, all reported 5q31.3 deletions have been de novo. For parents of an affected child, the risk to future pregnancies is presumed to be low, as a de novo genetic alteration involving PURA is most likely in the proband. However, parents of an affected child may wish to consider prenatal testing or preimplantation genetic diagnosis as risk may be greater than in the general population owing to the possibility of parental germline mosaicism (estimated empirically at",

      "abstract": "Le patologie neurodegenerative associate ai disturbi neuro- cognitivi (DNC) rappresentano una emergenza assistenziale dalle dimensioni epidemiologiche sempre più rilevanti. Tale emergenza è destinata ad aumen- tare in relazione a un progressivo aumento della prospettiva di vita, essendo i DNC correlati con l'età. Se è vero che i DNC si manifestano con una franca alterazione delle funzioni cognitive con impatto funzionale nella vita della persona colpita, è altrettanto vero che il processo patologico inizia, molte volte, prima della comparsa della sindrome clinica. In questo intervallo di tempo, anche a distanza di anni dall'esordio del DNC, possono presentarsi quadri clinici più o meno sfumati di disturbo cognitivo accomunati dall'e- tichetta di \"disturbo cognitivo lieve\" o Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) e di Disturbo Cognitivo Soggettivo o Subjective Cognitive Decline (SCD). Una generale sensibilità a queste forme prodromiche è necessaria per: 1) l'impostazione di un quadro di intervento farmacologico, neuropsicologico ed assistenziale tempestivo ed efficace; 2) l'inserimento della persona in trial clinici per la sperimentazione di farmaci per la stabilizzazione della patolo- gia degenerativa. Ad oggi la distinzione tra invecchiamento normale, forme lievi o soggettive e la loro evoluzione in quadri di DNC maggiori avviene attraverso una attenta anamnesi cognitivo-comportamentale ed una accura- ta valutazione clinica compreso un uso attento e competente degli strumenti cognitivi di screening. Tuttavia, negli ultimi anni, un apporto importante è anche stato offerto dalle tecnologie e nello specifico dall'Intelligenza Artificiale (IA), dal Machi- ne Learning (ML) e dal Deep Learning (DL). Questi strumenti si sono dimo- strati accurati e affidabili: 1) nella rilevazione precoce di un DNC; 2) nella prognosi di una potenziale evoluzione di un DNC lieve in maggiore; 3) nella diagnosi differenziale dei DNC. Il presente lavoro ha l'obiettivo di mostrare in che modo l'applicazione dell'IA, del ML e del DL possa contribuire a una più efficace e tempestiva diagnosi dei disturbi neurodegenerativi.",

Cognitive concerns in PD may affect multiple domains of neurocognition and vary across different stages of the disease. Extant research has focused mainly on cognitive deficits in middle to late stages of PD, whereas few studies have examined the unique cognitive profiles of patients with early-stage PD. This study addressed this gap in the published literature and examined neurocognitive functioning and functional capacity of patients with de novo PD, focusing on the unique pattern of cognitive deficits specific to the early stage of the disease. Results indicated that the pattern of cognitive deficits in patients with PD (n = 55; mean age = 72.93) was significantly different from healthy controls (n = 59; mean age = 71.88). Specifically, tasks related to executive functioning, attention, and verbal memory demonstrated the most pronounced deficits in patients with early-stage PD. Clinical implications of these findings are discussed.",

The four main phenotypes of motor neuron disease, based upon the site of origin and the severity of neurological involvement, are as follows: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, progressive bulbar palsy, progressive muscular atrophy, and primary lateral sclerosis.Other systems used for the classification of this disease have used the site of onset (spinal or bulbar onset), degree of adherence to the El-Escorial (and Airlie house) criteria, and pattern of heritability (sporadic versus familial) as criteria for characterizing this neurodegenerative illness with a complex genetic basis. MND has been shown to be a disease of middle age with a mean age of 58 to 63 years at the time of onset for sporadic Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), and 40-60 years of age for familial ALS.

      "abstract": "To critically discuss the neuropsychiatric symptoms in the prodromal stages of dementia in order to improve the early clinical diagnosis of cognitive and functional deterioration.Current criteria for cognitive syndrome, including Alzheimer's disease, comprise the neuropsychiatric symptoms in addition to cognitive and functional decline. Although there is growing evidence that neuropsychiatric symptoms may precede the prodromal stages of dementia, these manifestations have received less attention than traditional clinical hallmarks such as cognitive and functional deterioration. Depression, anxiety, apathy, irritability, agitation, sleep disorders, among other symptoms, have been hypothesized to represent a prodromal stage of dementia or, at least, they increase the risk for conversion from minor neurocognitive disorder to major neurocognitive disorder. Longitudinal investigations have provided increased evidence of progression to dementia in individuals with minor neurocognitive disorder when neuropsychiatric symptoms also were present.Although neuropsychiatric symptoms are strongly associated with a higher risk of cognitive and functional deterioration, frequently the clinician does not acknowledge these conditions as increasing the risk of dementia. When the clinician accurately diagnoses neuropsychiatric symptoms in the prodromal stage of dementia, he could early establish appropriate treatment and, may be, delay the beginning of clinical and functional deterioration.",

      "abstract": "In this review we present a pragmatic approach to the patient with chronic vestibular symptoms. Even in the chronic patient a retrospective diagnosis should be attempted, in order to establish how the patient reached the current situation. Simple questions are likely to establish if the chronic dizzy symptoms started as benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), vestibular neuritis, vestibular migraine, Meniere's disease or as a brainstem stroke. Then it is important to establish if the original symptoms are still present, in which case they need to be treated (e.g. repositioning maenouvres for BPPV, migraine prophylaxis) or if you are only dealing with chronic dizzy symptoms. In addition the doctor or physiotherapist needs to establish if the process of central vestibular compensation has been impeded due to additional clinical problems, e.g. visual problems (squints, cataract operation), proprioceptive deficit (neuropathy due to diabetes or alcohol), additional neurological or orthopaedic problems, lack of mobility or confidence, such as fear of falling or psychological disorders. A general neurological examination should also be conducted, amongst other reasons to make sure your patient's `chronic dizziness' is not due to a neurological gait disorder. Treatment of the syndrome of chronic dizziness is multidisciplinary but rehabilitation and simple counselling should be available to all patients. In contrast, vestibular suppressants or tranquilisers should be reduced or, if possible, stopped.",

      "title": "Syndromes of Brain Dysfunction Presenting with Cognitive Impairment or Behavioral Disturbance: Delirium, Dementia, and Mental Disorders Caused by a General Medical Condition",
      "abstract": "The disorders under consideration are the result of identifiable conditions. Historically, an arbitrary distinction has been made between \"organic\" conditions, associated with a presumably clear pathological basis, and \"functional\" conditions, or psychiatric disorders that lacked obvious disease processes. Delirium, however, is a disorder of cognitive dysfunction that lacks a well-understood pathophysiology despite unequivocal association with multiple and various medical conditions. More generally, delirium and dementia are frequently complicated by psychopathology (for example, delusions or changes in mood) traditionally associated with so-called functional disorders (schizophrenia and affective disorders, respectively). The organic/functional distinction obscured the propensity of medical conditions (e.g., thyroid dysfunction) to present with psychiatric symptoms that resolved after effective treatment of the nonpsychiatric condition. The nosological conventions of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) (1) allow recognition of syndromes of disseminated cognitive dysfunction, such as delirium and dementia, as well as the psychopathology that is the product of various and multiple medical conditions without obscuring the need to consider these entities in the differential diagnosis of \"functional\" symptomatology. Regardless of the evolution of diagnostic convention, the illnesses described in this chapter can present to the psychiatrist as a \"mental\" condition or present to other medical specialists as \"medical\" conditions.",

      "title": "Promoting Physical Activity in People with Brain Impairments",
      "abstract": "Brain impairment is defined as a significant loss or abnormality in the brain structure. Brain impairments may be acquired as a result of trauma (e.g., traumatic brain injury or stroke), non-traumatic origins (e.g., tumour) or disease (e.g., Parkinsonrs disease or multiple sclerosis) or congenital (e.g., cerebral palsy) and are frequently associated with abnormal brain function (e.g., impaired memory, executive function and/ or impaired motor control). Evidence indicates that physical activity is beneficial for individuals with brain impairment as the subsequent loss of cardiovascular fitness, muscle strength and flexibility that occurs as a result of inactivity can compound the effects of the initial disability. Current cross-sectional evidence indicates that individuals with brain impairment are significantly less active than individuals without brain impairment. In order to address the low levels of physical activity in adults with brain impairment and thereby improve health, fitness and functioning, it is critical to develop interventions which effectively promote physically active behaviour in this population. The overall aim of the program of research described in this thesis is to contribute to the development and implementation of evidence-based physical activity promotion strategies in individuals with brain impairment. This thesis presents studies relating to two major subpopulations of people with brain impairment: adolescents with cerebral palsy (Chapters Three and Four); and adults with brain impairment (Chapters Five and Six). Chapter Three presents a systematic review of the clinimetric properties of objective and subjective measures of physical activity in adolescents with cerebral palsy. Seven measures were included in this review. Each measure had notable limitations related to the assessment of physical activity intensity and duration and compliance with the physical activity guidelines. The review identified accelerometry as a promising means of measuring physical activity as it is objective and can collect real-time activity data on the frequency, intensity, and duration of activity, allowing for meaningful comparison to the physical activity guidelines. Chapter Four presents a study that evaluated the validity of the ActiGraph accelerometer for the measurement of physical activity in children and adolescents with cerebral palsy. Results indicated that the ActiGraph is able to differentiate between different intensities of walking and that, for the purpose of classifying activity intensity, the cut-points developed by Evenson et al. for typically developing children had excellent classifaction accuracy for detecting moderate to vigorous physical activity. These findings indicate that the ActiGraph is a suitable device for measuring free-living ambulatory physical activity among children and adolescents with cerebral palsy and that the output can be used to make meaningful comparisons to the physical activity guidelines. Chapter Five presents a systematic review of the research relating to physical activity and adults with brain impairment mapped against the five phases of a behavioral epidemiological framework. Results indicated that the vast majority of research to date has focused on identifying the benefits of physical activity for people with brain impairment; that measures previously used to evaluate physical activity participation do not allow meaningful comparison to the physical activity guidelines; that the evidence relating to correlates of physical activity has been largely concerned with levels of impairment and self-efficacy and; there is a relative paucity of studies evaluating the efficacy of interventions that promote physically active behaviour in this population. Currently there are no studies that evaluate the translation of physical activity interventions previously shown to be successful in controlled efficacy or effectiveness studies into widespread practice. On the basis of these results, it is concluded that future studies should consider a community-based rehabilitation model of intervention and that the rigor of such studies would be enhanced by the use of objective measures of physical activity. Chapter Six presents the results of a randomised controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy of a physical activity promotion intervention for community-dwelling adults with brain impairment. The intervention utilised elements of a community-based rehabilitation approach to deliver a lifestyle intervention to community-dwelling adults with brain impairment and outcomes were evaluated using an objective measure of physical activity. After the 12-week program, intervention participants exhibited significant increases in average counts per minute (cpm) (60.9 p 20.7 cpm, p= .004) and daily average time spent in moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) (10.4 p 4.0 mins MVPA, p= .01). Daily counts per minute and time spent in moderate to vigorous physical activity declined significantly among attention controls (-11.1 p 22.9 cpm; -2.6 p 4.5 mins MVPA). Net differences in daily counts per minute and time spent in moderate to vigorous physical activity were 71.9 cpm (p= .02) and 12.9 mins MVPA (p= .03), respectively. Between-condition differences in the physical activity outcomes were not significant at 3-months follow-up. These findings are noteworthy given the particularly low rates of physical activity participation in this population and the significant physical and environmental barriers that individuals with brain impairment face. Given the rigour of the study, the results are sufficiently positive to warrant conducting a larger scale effectiveness trial utilising trained practitioners in clinical practice settings.n",

The causes of sleep disturbance in PD are numerous, and many patients may have several factors that contribute. These disorders can be broadly categorized into those that involve nocturnal sleep and daytime manifestations such as excessive daytime sleepiness. Some sleep disorders, in particular REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) and excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS) may arise as a primary manifestation of PD, reflecting the anatomic areas affected by the neurodegenerative process. Appropriate diagnosis of the sleep disturbance affecting a PD patient can lead to specific treatments that can consolidate nocturnal sleep and enhance daytime alertness. © 2007 Movement Disorder Society",

A neurological syndrome associated with a liver disease may be a complication of the disease, it may be induced by a factor that also contributes to the disease—for example, alcohol—or it may have no relation to the presence of the liver disease. Neurological deficits associated with liver disease may affect the CNS, the peripheral nervous system, or both. This review focuses on syndromes characterised by altered CNS function associated with structural liver diseases. Space does not permit consideration of peripheral neuropathies associated with liver disease (for example, xanthomatous peripheral neuropathy), diseases of childhood that affect the liver and CNS (for example, Reye’s syndrome), or neurological consequences of hepatic lesions characterised by specific enzyme deficiencies (for example, congenital hyperammonaemias, the porphyrias, kernicterus, galactosaemia, and Zellweger’s syndrome (cerebrohepatorenal syndrome)).\n\nThat there is a relationship between the functional status of the liver and that of the brain has been known for centuries.1 The most widely recognised aspect of this relation is that hepatocellular failure may be complicated by the behavioural syndrome of hepatic encephalopathy, in which neurotransmission in the brain is altered.2 3 Recently, it has been suggested that two other behavioural complications of liver disease, scratching due to pruritus in cholestatic patients4 5 and profound fatigue in patients with chronic cholestasis,6 7 may also be associated with altered neurotransmission in the brain.\n\n### DEFINITIONS AND CLASSIFICATION\n\nThe term hepatic encephalopathy refers to the syndrome of neuropsychiatric disturbances that may arise as a complication of acute, subacute, or chronic hepatocellular failure. The syndrome is associated with increased portal-systemic shunting of gut derived constituents of portal venous blood, due to their impaired extraction by the failing liver and, in most instances, their passage through intrahepatic and/or extrahepatic portal-systemic venous collateral channels.\n\nThe term portal-systemic encephalopathy …",

Different types of trauma (e.g., mechanical injury, electrical injury, anoxic injury, repetitive injury) incurred on different parts of the nervous system (brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerves) in various ways (single or repetitive injury) have produced a great variety of movement disorders (parkinsonism, dystonia, tremors, hyperkinesis). Trauma can cause movement disorders directly, it can increase the risk for certain diseases affecting the extrapyramidal system, or it can act as a catalyst for the manifestation of an underlying subclinical condition. The significance of risk factors (such as family history of movement disorders and previous use of antidopaminergic agents) for the development of post-traumatic movement disorders remains controversial. The underlying pathophysiology is poorly understood, but it appears that regardless of the location of the trauma, both peripheral and central nervous system mechanisms may be involved.",

      "abstract": "The driving ability of patients with Parkinson's disease may deteriorate due to motor impairment, cognitive deficits, and the side-effects of antiparkinsonian medication. In particular, sudden sleep episodes and daytime sleepiness have been discussed as major problems in the past decade. Although evidence consistently shows that patients' driving ability is impaired and that patients are not able to assess the impairment adequately, studies differ as to the exact influence of the aforementioned factors. This may be explained by various factors which moderate the association between driving ability and disease-related impairments (e.g. the measure of driving ability or the type and difficulty of the test or driving task being undertaken). Thus, even though all the aforementioned factors have been shown to have significant impact on driving performance, they are not sufficient to predict driving ability. Recent research has shown that the ability to compensate for disease-related impairments seems to be a crucial factor, and should be considered a major reason for the large interindividual variation of driving performance even at the same disease stage. Unfortunately, compensatory behaviour is not captured by traditional psychometric tests. Therefore, future studies should put special emphasis on the diagnosis of compensatory behaviour and how to train it. Basically, driving ability has to be assessed individually and must be considered not as a static, but as a dynamic factor which can be preserved and even improved.",

Debe diferenciarse, fundamentalmente, del trastorno del espectro autista y de las afasias adquiridas como el sindrome de Landau-Kleffner. Las exploraciones neurofisiologicas mas utilizadas son el electroencefalograma analogico y cuantificado, la polisomnografia, el potencial evocado troncular y los potenciales cognitivos P300 y N400. Estos estudios muestran la existencia de alteraciones en subgrupos de disfasias como paroxismos, ritmo theta asimetrico y alteraciones de los potenciales cognitivos. Conclusiones. Las actividades bioelectricas anormales plantean la posibilidad de una inmadurez con diversas manifestaciones, a confirmar en nuevos trabajos.",

The aetiology of neuropsychiatric symptoms associated with epilepsy is a combination of biological and psychological factors. The following neuropsychiatric symptoms may occur in patients with epilepsy: personality changes, psychosis, depression and aggressive behavior. For management of neuropsychiatric conditions, use psychotropics that do not significantly lower seizure threshold. Procaine penicillin may induce neuropsychiatric improvement even in severe disease. Mainstay of treatment of neuropsychiatric disorder is the reduction of copper levels using dietary copper restriction and/or chelating agents such as D-penicillamine. All symptoms can improve with treatment.",

MSA is an α-synucleinopathy with specific glioneuronal degeneration involving striatonigral, olivopontocerebellar, and autonomic nervous systems but also other parts of the central and peripheral nervous systems[3]. Clinical manifestations include hypotension, urinary retention, constipation, ataxia, parkinsonism, and postural instability. Multiple system atrophy affects both men and women equally, the first symptoms usually appear after age 53. The etiology of this pathology is unknown, but is associated with the accumulation of bodies containing alpha-synuclein in different parts of the brain[1]. There are two types of MSA. The first type occurs with a predominance of cerebellar dysfunctions: ataxia, postural instability. In the clinical setting of the second type of MSA, symptoms of parkinsonism predominate, such as muscle rigidity, bradykinesia, postural disturbances, non-resting tremor and dysarthria. Also, both types exhibit autonomic disorders. The prognosis for this pathology is unfavorable; after the first symptoms appear, life expectancy is 9-10 years.",

Genetic factors include apolipoprotein ε4, cholecystokinin genotyping, and glucocerebrosidase mutations. Extrinsic factors that trigger psychosis include systemic inflammation and medication of risky drugs. To prevent such psychosis, it is important to examine systemic infection, cease high-risk drugs, and then consider prescription of anti-psychotic drugs.

Neurological and cardiac symptoms may share underlying physiopathological mechanisms in diseases, such as Friedreich's ataxia and Wilson's disease, and in certain metabolic disorders, including Refsum disease, Gaucher disease, a congenital disorder of glycosylation, or cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. In certain conditions, such as Sydenham's chorea or dilated cardiomyopathy with ataxia syndrome (ATX-DNAJC19), heart involvement can present early in the course of disease, whereas in others such as Friedreich's ataxia or Refsum disease, cardiac symptoms tend to present in later stages. In another 68 acquired or inherited conditions, cardiac involvement or movement disorders are seldom reported.As cardiac disease is part of the phenotypic spectrum of several movement disorders, heart involvement should be carefully investigated and increased awareness of this association encouraged as it may represent a leading cause of morbidity and mortality.",

The symptoms of neurogenic dysphagia include drooling, difficulty initiating swallowing, nasal regurgitation, difficulty managing secretions, choke/cough episodes while feeding, and food sticking in the throat. If unrecognized and untreated, neurogenic dysphagia can lead to dehydration, malnutrition, and respiratory complications. The symptoms of neurogenic dysphagia may be relatively inapparent on account of both compensation for swallowing impairment and diminution of the laryngeal cough reflex due to a variety of factors. Patients with symptoms of oropharyngeal dysphagia should undergo videofluoroscopy of swallowing, which in the case of neurogenic dysphagia typically reveals impairment of oropharyngeal motor performance and/or laryngeal protection. The many causes of neurogenic dysphagia include stroke, head trauma, Parkinson's disease, motor neuron disease and myopathy. Evaluation of the cause of unexplained neurogenic dysphagia should include consultation by a neurologist, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, blood tests (routine studies plus muscle enzymes, thyroid screening, vitamin B12 and anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies), electromyography/nerve conduction studies, and, in certain cases, muscle biopsy or cerebrospinal fluid examination. Treatment of neurogenic dysphagia involves treatment of the underlying neurologic disorder (if possible), swallowing therapy (if oral feeding is reasonably safe to attempt) and gastrostomy (if oral feeding is unsafe or inadequate).",

Non-motor signs such as olfactory deficits, cognitive impairment, sleep behavior disorders, and gastrointestinal disturbances are reflecting disturbances in the non-dopaminergic system. They precede dopaminergic neuronal degenerations by 5–10 years and are considered the main contributors to patients’ disability, particularly after the successful implementation of levodopa (L-dopa) treatment of motor symptoms.

      "title": "Percepción de fatiga central en la enfermedad de parkinson: factores clínicos, psicopatológicos y neuropsicológicos",
      "abstract": "INTRODUCCION La Enfermedad de Parkinson (EP) se caracteriza por la neurodegeneracion de celulas dopaminergicas localizadas en la sustancia negra pars compacta. Algunas evidencias sugieren que no solo se afecta el sistema dopaminergico, sino tambien el noradrenergico, serotoninergico, colinergico, etc. Esto ampliaria el espectro de manifestaciones clinicas y justificaria la aparicion de sintomas psiquiatricos y cognitivos. La fatiga central es uno de los sintomas mas frecuentes e invalidantes de la EP. Sin embargo, su mecanismo causal y relacion con otros sintomas no-motores es poco conocida. Segun la hipotesis de A. Chaudhuri, debe considerarse el esfuerzo voluntario como una variable sujeta a sistemas de control que regulan el esfuerzo realizado. Algunos de estos mecanismos se relacionan con las respuestas motivacionales y emocionales, siendo influenciados por los cambios somaticos y la retroalimentacion desde los sistemas motores, sensoriales y cognitivos. Asi, las respuestas emocionales son uno de los elementos necesarios para la percepcion normal de fatiga. La hipotesis del marcador somatico de Bechara considera que las senales somaticas procedentes de la respuesta vegetativa ante una emocion (marcadores somaticos) son procesadas por estructuras neuronales superiores y regulan la toma de decisiones. Este proceso puede valorarse con pruebas neuropsicologicas, destacando entre ellas el Iowa Gambling Task (IGT). OBJETIVOS HIPOTESIS: Los objetivos principales fueron: (1) describir la prevalencia de fatiga central en una muestra de pacientes con EP, (2) evaluar la relacion entre diferentes sintomas psicopatologicos y la fatiga central y (3) evaluar la relacion entre la percepcion de los marcadores somaticos y la presencia de fatiga central en pacientes con EP. Los objetivos secundarios fueron: (1) valorar la asociacion entre la presencia y gravedad de fatiga central y diferentes caracteristicas clinicas, (2) valorar la relacion entre la presencia y gravedad de fatiga central y el rendimiento cognitivo en tareas neuropsicologicas que evaluan la capacidad atencional y funciones ejecutivas en pacientes con EP y (3) valorar la relacion entre diferentes variables clinicas, neuropsicologicas y psicopatologicas y el rendimiento en el IGT en pacientes con EP. La hipotesis del presente trabajo considera que la incorrecta interpretacion de los marcadores somaticos y/o la existencia de psicopatologia que altere la motivacion, podrian aumentar la percepcion de fatiga central en los pacientes con EP. METODOS: Estudio transversal con una muestra de 96 pacientes con EP. La gravedad de la enfermedad se evaluo con la escala UPDRS y la de Hoehn y Yahr. Los sintomas psicopatologicos se valoraron con escalas especificas y validadas para depresion, anhedonia, ansiedad, apatia, impulsividad y sensibilidad al refuerzo y recompensa. Ademas, a los pacientes se les realizo una exploracion neuropsicologica que incluia pruebas que valoran el cortex prefrontal dorsolateral (Stroop, Trail Making Task y Torre de Londres) y el ventromedial (IGT). RESULTADOS De los 96 pacientes, 34 (35.4%) presentaron fatiga y 28 (82.4%) la consideraron uno de sus peores sintomas. No habia diferencias entre los pacientes con y sin fatiga en relacion al genero, edad, edad de debut de la enfermedad, estadio clinico, fenotipo y complicaciones motoras, tratamiento e insomnio. Los pacientes con fatiga tenian una mayor lateralizacion motora izquierda y una menor gravedad motora. La presencia de fatiga se asocio con una mayor frecuencia de antecedentes psiquiatricos y una mayor puntuacion en las escalas de depresion, ansiedad y apatia (menor curiosidad intelectual e iniciacion de la accion). La depresion, ansiedad, curiosidad intelectual y lateralidad se relacionaron con una mayor gravedad de la percepcion de fatiga. No hubo diferencias estadisticamente significativas entre los dos grupos de pacientes en las pruebas neuropsicologicas realizadas, excepto en el IGT. A medida que los pacientes con fatiga progresaban en la realizacion del IGT, no mostraban un aprendizaje, seleccionando cartas con mas riesgo a lo largo de todo el proceso. La peor realizacion del IGT tambien se relacionaba con una mayor impulsividad, ansiedad rasgo, sensibilidad al castigo y apatia. DISCUSION Los resultados sugieren que la fatiga es frecuente en la EP y que se asocia con sintomas de apatia, depresion y ansiedad. Tambien indican que los diferentes dominios de la apatia tienen un impacto diferente sobre la fatiga, siendo la curiosidad intelectual y la iniciacion de la accion las subescalas que muestran una mayor relacion con la presencia de fatiga central. Desde un punto de vista neurobiologico, se podria hipotetizar que esta considerable asociacion deriva de un origen neurobiologico similar. Los pacientes con fatiga tenian un peor rendimiento en el IGT, hecho que sugiere una mayor dificultad para asociar los resultados de un esfuerzo con senales emocionales o autonomicas de origen interno. Esta observacion es congruente con la hipotesis de A. Chaudhuri: el peor rendimiento en el IGT indica que la fatiga emerge, al menos en parte, de una deficiente evaluacion de los estimulos de origen somatico.",

The modern attitude, expressed by Feiling, 1 is to think of sciatica as sginifying sciatic pain without connoting any particular pathogenesis. DaCosta 2 states that true sciatica is not a neuritis. Moersch 3 believes that differentiation of neuralgia from neuritis of the sciatic nerve is of clinical importance. The usual classification of sciatica into primary, secondary and idiopathic groups is inaccurate and, in view of present knowledge, inadequate. More correctly, one may classify, first, sciatic neuritis or a true inflammation of the nerve; secondly, a reflex sciatic neuralgia or essential sciatica. Before the essential reflex neuralgias are described, it is necessary to classify and discuss sciatic neuritis. An inflammation of the sciatic nerve may be either primary or secondary.",

      "title": "Сlinical and genetic predictors of anxiety in patients with Parkinson's disease",
      "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a chronic progressive neurodegenerative disorder primarily associated with dopamine deficiency in the central nervous system, accompanied by the development of both motor and non-motor symptoms. Neuropsychiatric symptoms, as a subset of non-motor manifestations, play a major role in disease burden and reduced quality of life in patients. One of the leading symptoms in this category is anxiety, which develops not only as a psychological reaction to the disease but is mainly caused by neurotransmitter dysfunctions (dopaminergic, noradrenergic, serotonergic, and GABAergic dysfunctions in the striatum, limbic system, and thalamus). It is also suggested that anxiety in PD may be associated with genetic factors. Objective: To examine the predictive role of clinical manifestations and genetic biomarkers (Val66Met mutation in the BDNF gene and Ser9Gly mutation in the DRD3 gene) in the development of anxiety in Parkinson’s disease. The study included 130 patients with Parkinson’s disease, who were divided into two groups based on the presence of anxiety. The first group consisted of 33 PD patients with anxiety, with a median age of 67.0 [60.0; 71.5] years. The second group included 97 patients without anxiety, with a median age of 67.0 [61.0; 72.5] years. Standardized scales were used to assess motor and non-motor symptoms. Frequencies were used to describe nominal data. Pearson’s χ² test was applied to compare two or more independent groups of nominal data. Quantitative data were presented as medians with interquartile ranges, and the Mann–Whitney U test was used for comparisons. Differences were considered statistically significant at p ≤ 0.05. The patients with PD and anxiety had a longer history of the disease, high levels of depression, frequent presence of non-motor symptoms and a lower quality of life. The motor deficit in the 3rd part of the UPDRS scale in patients with anxiety was 41.0 [31.50; 48.50] points versus 35.0 [21.0; 44.50] points in patients without anxiety (p = 0.047). On the contrary, there were no differences in cognitive status and daytime sleepiness between the two groups of patients. As a result of a molecular genetic study, a statistically significant predominance of TC and CC genotypes of rs6280 polymorphism of the DRD3 gene (c.25G&gt;A p.Gly9Ser) and GA and AA genotypes of rs6265 polymorphism of the BDNF gene was revealed in patients with PD and anxiety. As a result of this study, it was revealed that the development of anxiety in Parkinson’s disease is influenced by the length of the disease, depression, the number of non-motor symptoms, and motor deficiency. In addition, the patients with anxiety were characterized by a lower quality of life than the patients whose anxiety was not detected. As for the genetic basis, our study indicates the contribution of polymorphic variants of the DRD3 (rs6280) and BDNF (rs6265) genes to the development of anxiety in PD.",

If this were so it would be valuable to recognize it not only from the pathological point of view but also, since peripheral nerves are more easily investigated during life, for differential diagnosis which is often difficult and sometimes impossible on clinical findings alone. While involvement of the lower motor neurone is unlikely to be present without causing physical signs impairment of sensation due to involvement of the primary sensory neurone may be overlooked, more especially because sensory testing is often not possible in demented patients.",

Agitation describes an increased level of psychomotor activity, and anxious or aggressive behaviour. Many agitated patients may also be delirious, yet they only represent a minority of all delirious patients. ICU delirium is an acute cognitive disorder of both consciousness and content of thought. The hallmark of ICU delirium is a fluctuating mental status, inattention, and an altered level of consciousness. Delirium is the end product of a sequence of insults and injury that lead to a common measurable manifestation of end-organ brain injury. It does not have a single aetiology, but often has multiple different and potentially interacting aetiologies. Both non-modifiable and modifiable risk factors play important roles in the development of delirium. Importantly, the new onset of delirium should prompt the physician to investigate the underlying cause. Cognitive impairment and age are among the most important non-modifiable risk factors, whereas administration of benzodiazepines is the greatest. The alpha-2 adrenoceptor agonist dexmedetomidine shows promise as a sedative reducing the risk for delirium when compared with benzodiazepines.",

      "title": "L'impact des dyskinésies sur le répertoire moteur des patients atteints de la maladie de Parkinson",
      "abstract": "Introduction. Les symptomes moteurs classiques engendres par la maladie de Parkinson, comme le tremblement, la bradykinesie, la rigidite et l'instabilite posturale, sont principalement attenues a l'aide de traitements pharmaceutiques. Toutefois, la prise prolongee de ces traitements, combinee a l'evolution de la maladie, entraine des complications motrices, tels que les dyskinesies. La gestion des dyskinesies se fait preferentiellement par l'ajustement des traitements pharmaceutiques. Cependant, ces ajustements peuvent conduire a la reapparition des symptomes cardinaux de la maladie de Parkinson. L'impact des dyskinesies sur la vie des patients n'est pas clairement defini puisque certaines etudes suggerent que les dyskinesies ne constituent pas le probleme majeur des patients en comparaison aux symptomes cardinaux, alors que d'autres avancent qu'elles compromettent l'autonomie et la qualite de vie (QdV) des patients. Dans la mesure ou la gestion des dyskinesies peut exacerber les symptomes moteurs de la maladie de Parkinson, il devient essentiel de determiner objectivement i) quel(s) symptome(s) est/sont deja present(s) chez les patients dyskinetiques, ii) quel(s) symptome(s) est/sont problematique(s) pour l'execution d'activites de la vie quotidienne (AVQ), et iii) quel(s) symptome(s) est/sont relie(s) a la QdV et a la participation des patients dans des AVQ. Methode. 121 patients diagnostiques avec la maladie de Parkinson et connus pour avoir des dyskinesies ont ete recrutes pour cette etude. Les patients etaient equipes de 17 centrales inertielles positionnees sur chaque segment du corps, permettant l'enregistrement en 3 dimensions des mouvements pendant des AVQ. Les niveaux de dyskinesies, de tremblement, de bradykinesie, et le blocage de la marche etaient mesures a l'aide de ces capteurs, alors que les niveaux d'instabilite posturale et de rigidite etaient mesures a l'aide de tests cliniques. Le declin cognitif et les symptomes depressifs etaient mesures avec le Mini-Mental State Examination et le 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale. L'engagement des patients dans des AVQ, ainsi que le nombre d'activites affectees par leur symptomatologie ont ete mesures avec l'Activity Card Sort, alors que la QdV des patients etait mesuree avec le 12-item Short Form Survey. Les donnees de 69 participants en sante, d'âge et de genre comparables aux patients, ont servi a etablir les seuils de presence de la symptomatologie et de performance des AVQ. Les symptomes influencant la performance des AVQ ont ete identifies avec des regressions logistiques, alors que le niveau symptomatologique critique auquel la performance se degrade a ete calcule avec des courbes ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) et les indices de Youden. L'engagement des patients dans des AVQ, les activites affectees par la symptomatologie et la QdV des patients dyskinetiques ont ete compares avec les participants en sante, avant de verifier leur lien avec la symptomatologie a l'aide de correlations de Spearman et de regressions multiples. Resultats. Dans une premiere etude avec 89 patients, ceux presentant des dyskinesies avaient aussi du tremblement de repos, de posture et cinetique (12,7%, 37,1%, et 15,9% respectivement), de la bradykinesie (28,6%), de la rigidite (55,6%), de l'instabilite posturale (71,4%), et du blocage pendant la marche (9,5%). Les deux etudes suivantes, realisees avec 121 patients incluant les 89 de la premiere etude, ont permis de mettre en evidence que les patients etaient significativement plus longs et faisaient plus d'erreurs que les participants en sante pour effectuer des AVQ. Les analyses multivariees ont revele que, pour la majorite des tâches, les dyskinesies n'etaient pas associees a une baisse de performance, contrairement a l'instabilite posturale, au tremblement, a la rigidite et au declin cognitif. D'autre part, les dyskinesies n'etaient pas correlees avec l'engagement des patients dans des AVQ, les activites affectees, et la QdV. En revanche, le tremblement, l'instabilite posturale et la depression etaient significativement correles avec ces variables et comptaient pour 34%, 36% et 18% de leurs variances respectives. Conclusion. Ces trois etudes demontrent que les symptomes cardinaux de la maladie de Parkinson restent presents lorsque les patients ont des dyskinesies a peak-dose, que ces symptomes cardinaux sont plus predicteurs d'echec que les dyskinesies pour l'execution d'AVQ, et qu'ils ont plus d'influence sur la QdV et la participation des patients.\r\n_____________________________________________________________________________ \r\nMOTS-CLES DE L’AUTEUR : Maladie de Parkinson, Dyskinesies induites par la medication, Activites de la vie quotidienne, Qualite de vie",

      "abstract": "Cognitive impairment in patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD), which may occur in various severities, represents one of the commonest and most disabling non-motor manifestations during the course of the disease, causing a negative impact on patients’ quality of life. Eventually, it becomes a burden for the family members and/or the caregivers of patients, as it progresses to PD dementia. Current pharmacological treatments for cognitive impairment in PD exhibit partial efficacy, while novel effective therapeutic strategies are required. Accumulating preclinical and clinical evidence shows that several agents may provide beneficial effects on patients with PD and cognitive impairment, including ceftriaxone, ambroxol, intranasal insulin, nilotinib, atomoxetine, mevidalen, blarcamesine, prasinezumab, SYN120, ENT-01, NYX-458, GRF6021, fosgonimeton, INT-777, Neuropeptide S, silibinin, osmotin, cordycepin, huperzine A, fibroblast growth factor 21, Poloxamer 188, ginsenoside Rb1, thioredoxin-1, tangeretin, istradefylline, and Eugenia uniflora. Potential underlying mechanisms include the inhibition of a-synuclein aggregation, improvement of mitochondrial function, regulation of synaptic plasticity, impact on gut-brain axis, modulation of neuroinflammation, upregulation of neurotrophic factors, as well as cholinergic, dopaminergic, serotoninergic and norepinephrine neurotransmission. In this overview, we aim to cover the clinical aspects of PD associated cognitive impairment, highlighting recent evidence on emerging treatment approaches that are currently under investigation at a preclinical and clinical level.",

      "abstract": "By the time patients present with motor symptoms of Parkinson disease (PD), two-thirds of their dopaminergic neurons will have died and at least some of the remaining dopaminergic neurons may already be affected by the molecular mechanisms that will eventually lead to their death. It is plausible to assume that any neuroprotective therapy for PD might be much more effective if individuals at risk could be started on such therapy while they are still in the premotor stage of the disease. Excellent epidemiologic combined with long-time clinical follow-up studies have unequivocally established that individuals with common but nonspecific symptoms, such as autonomic dysfunction including constipation, erectile and urinary dysfunction, and neuropsychiatric symptoms like depression or hyposmia, are at increased risk of developing PD.1 Other premotor manifestations of PD, in particular REM sleep behavioral disorder (RBD), are much more characteristic for premotor PD, but comparatively rare. Any attempt to base the identification of premotor PD on clinical observation only is therefore limited by low specificity (as would be the case for constipation) or sensitivity (as for RBD). Moreover, low specificity of some markers alludes to another major drawback in the search of biomarkers: the heterogeneity of PD. To evaluate markers reliably, it is therefore important to assess cohorts in whom homogenous pathogenesis can be assumed. This is the case in individuals who share the same genetically determined risk. Monogenetic forms of PD are, however, rare, and it is therefore difficult to recruit such genetically determined cohorts.",

As a common neurodegenerative disorder, PD affects 1% to 2% of the general population over 65 years of age.1 In addition to major motor symptoms, a variety of non-motor symptoms appear throughout the course of PD.2 These non-motor symptoms comprise a variety of cognitive, neuropsychiatric, sleep, autonomic, and sensory disorders. Among different non-motor symptoms, cognitive disorder such as dementia is a frequent manifestation of advanced PD.3 Dementia is the most devastating nonmotor feature that causes severe decline in quality of life. It increases caregiver burden and mortality as well as institutionalization. The prevalence of dementia in PD ranges from 24% to 50%. PD dementia accounts for about 3–4% of all dementia in the population.3 Therefore, identifying biomarkers that can predict the development of PD dementia is important as they could help clinician select high-risk patients for appropriate counseling and plans for future treatment. Although the pathophysiologic mechanisms involved in the development of dementia in PD remain unknown, postmortem and in vivo studies as well as epidemiological and pre-clinical studies have suggested that neuro-inflammation may play an important role in the pathogenesis of PD, especially in the non-motor symptoms such as cognitive impairClinical Implication of High Sensitivity C-Reactive Protein for the Development of Dementia in Parkinson’s Disease",

      "abstract": "Neuropsychiatric disorders are one of the leading causes of disability worldwide and affect the health of billions of people. Previous publications have demonstrated that neuropsychiatric disorders can cause histomorphological damage in particular regions of the brain. By using a clinical symptom-comparing approach, 55 neuropsychiatric signs or symptoms related usually to 14 types of acute and chronic brain insults were identified and categorized in the present study. Forty percent of the 55 neuropsychiatric signs and symptoms have been found to be commonly shared by the 14 brain insults. A meta-analysis supports existence of the same neuropsychiatric signs or symptoms in all brain insults. The results suggest that neuronal damage might be occurring in the same or similar regions or structures of the brain. Neuronal cell death, neural loss and axonal degeneration in some parts of the brain (the limbic system, basal ganglia system, brainstem, cerebellum, and cerebral cortex) might be the histomorphological basis that is responsible for the neuropsychiatric symptom clusters. These morphological alterations may be the result of secondary neuronal damage (a cascade of progressive neural injury and neuronal cell death that is triggered by the initial insult). Secondary neuronal damage causes neuronal cell death and neural injury in not only the initial injured site but also remote brain regions. It may be a major contributor to subsequent neuropsychiatric disorders following brain insults.",

Blurry vision is commonly associated with PD, but often challenging to interpret. The clinical spectrum of blurred vision is broad, and finding the underlying aetiology can be challenging. An incomplete diagnosis impedes therapeutic successes. We report two persons with PD who both experienced blurry vision, but each with a different underlying pathology that called for specific ophthalmological and neurological treatments. In case 1, the blurry vision was presumably caused by strabismus and convergence insufficiency, while case 2 had blurry vision partly due to palinopsia, a higher order visual processing deficit. Adequate treatment improved vision in both cases. Neurologists should be aware of the different underlying causes of blurred vision, should master the basic therapeutic approaches, and know when to refer a patient to the ophthalmology department.",

      "abstract": "The cognitive disorders observed in non-demented Parkinsonian patients are frequent but subtle. They mostly result from difficulties to control attentional resources. These deficits particularly disturb the strategies involved in planning as well as in encoding and retrieval processing of memory, whereas consolidation of the mnemonic traces and instrumental functions are relatively spared. These deficits can be related to the striatal dopamine depletion (in particular in the caudate nuclei) which seems sufficient to account for the cognitive disorders that appear early in the course of the disease. In particular, the caudate dopamine depletion induces a cascade of dysfunction within the basal ganglia, downstream of the striatum, which ultimately affects the prefrontal functions. It is likely that, in the course of the disease, lesions of other ascending systems of neurotransmission (cholinergic, serotoninergic and noradrenergic pathways) contribute to worsen the cognitive disorders and also to modify their clinical pattern. The impact of direct cortical lesions can also be discussed but it seems that these lesions mostly contribute to the cognitive deficits in the late stages of Parkinson's disease.",

      "title": "Cell-based therapies for neural replacement strategies in stroke-related neurodegeneration: neurophysiological insights into stem progenitor cell neurogenesis within a host environment",
      "abstract": "The restricted neurogenesis limits the brain ability to overcome neuronal cell death following ischemic lesion: Failure of the damaged brain to regenerate following cerebral ischemia results in functional deficits those are most often irreversible and can further deteriorate, causing mortality and severe disability, progressive memory loss and cognitive impairments, known as dementia. This is caused by massive neuronal cell death and neurotoxicity following limited blood supply to the brain. Ischemic death of brain neurons (acute or delayed after lesion) has been the etiology of vascular dementia, the second most common type of dementia after Alzheimer's disease. Multiple types of vascular dementia exist, common in cognitive decline that gradually worsens and variable in where strokes happen (subcortical dementia) or how severe lesions are (e.g., major stroke, series of small strokes or brief transient ischemic attacks). It has emerged a synergistic combination of both Alzheimer's disease and vascular disease that often comes (mixed dementia). For over the last three decades after the ischemia-induced neuronal cell death had been discovered, intense research has been focused on withdrawing or, at least, attenuating neurodegeneration to improve restoring function in experimental models of post-stroke cognitive impairments while mimicking focal ischemia, permanent or transient brain lesions, hypertension or reproducing Alzheimer's disease combined with vascular pathology [for review (Hainsworth et al., 2017)]. Long-standing perspectives that ischemic neuronal death might be potentially suspended through activation of endogenous neuroprotection stay with genomic reprogramming and/or gene activation for de novo protein synthesis, relied on the hypoxia-activated signaling pathways (Dirnagl et al., 2009). On the other hands, pre-clinical studies, including our own works (Kopach et al., 2016; Rybachuk et al., 2017), have reported functional impairments at the later times (weeks) post-ischemia (as in principal neurons as within network), with controversial effectiveness of pharmacological therapeutics utilized after lesion. Unfulfilled regeneration convinces experimental neuroscientists to focus on cell-based therapies for neuronal replacement strategies used to overcome massive neuronal loss in the brain tissue subjected to ischemia. The major issue, however, remains how this therapy should be utilized in order to promote beneficial effects timely, namely via engraftment of neural stem progenitor cells (NSPCs) or already differentiated stem cell-derived neurons into the damaged brain. From that, the other conceptual question arises regarding the regulatory role of a host environment in either NSPC neurogenesis or functional integration of the grafted stem cell-derived cells. If choose the latter, what 'proper' proportion of the entirely different phenotypes needs to be grafted to possibly succeed? More insights into this are essential when considering cell therapy while aiming at remodeling of the damaged post-stroke brain from mixed stem cell-derived cells for restoring the broken functionality of such a complex tissue as the brain. NSPC grafts mature neuronal phenotype within a host tissue in a weeks' time: The survival rate of differentiated stem cell-derived cells grafted into the organized brain tissue has been routinely low – this suggests a strong regulatory role of the host environment in the viability of stem cells. As an alternative, grafting NSPCs could potentially promote the multipotent stem cell differentiation and subsequent maturation of the entirely different phenotypes, regulated by endogenous environment, to pave the way towards 'self-repair' of damaged tissue while engaging the endogenous mechanisms of self-renewal. However, discoveries in this field are hampered by technical challenges and controversy in clinically translatable advances. Eventually, the enormous potential of stem cell therapy has been evidenced for post-stroke recovery (Tornero et al., 2017) while its neurophysiological basis has been much less learned thus far. Repeatedly reported common patterns of firing and synaptic activity have been recorded from the stem cell-derived neurons at the very end time-points – typically few months after transplantation – that fosters underestimation of the time-dependent neurophysiological integration of differentiated cells into the host tissue. In our recent study, we have traced the time courses of maturation and integration of the NSPC-derived neurons into the host circuits, demonstrating their matured excitability and synaptogenesis (to the level of endogenous principal neurons – CA1 pyramidal neurons) within 3 weeks or less in situ (Kopach et al., 2018). To neurophysiological point of view, biophysical properties (Na+/K+ conductance, capability for high-frequency firing, characteristic excitatory transmission) make these cells physiologically credible those are capable to constitute specified relationships with other cells, providing functional impact. This also points out the accelerated rate of neuronal maturation of NSPC grafts in situ when compared with much longer time required to achieve similar patterns of activity by stem cell-derived neurons in vitro (Morgan et al., 2012; Shi et al., 2012; Telezhkin et al., 2016). For restorative neuroscience, a query remains to precisely define the timing of NSPC-derived phenotypes mature and set the appropriate activity within the damaged, pathophysiological environment. Establishing this is primary to enabling the assessment of timing for emerging beneficial effects, to design and rationale further reaching perspectives for accelerating stem cell neurogenesis while considering replacement strategies for various post-stroke brain regions (subpopulations of neurons, other neural cell types). Post-ischemic environment regulates neurogenesis of NSPC grafts: An in situ modelling of cerebral ischemia provides technological advantages for feasibly exploring the ischemia-induced neuronal cell death together with managing therapeutic approaches for targeted interventions in the organized brain tissue. In translational neuroscience, this methodology benefits with a meaningful consideration of variable experimental modifications utilized to mimic ischemic insult and onset of cell therapy (depending on how severe and complex the ischemic impairments are, diverse stem cell origin, etc.). In our study of an in situ modelling of cerebral ischemia optimized for a delayed death of principal neurons [within 2 weeks instead of acute CA1 neuronal death (Rybachuk et al., 2017)], we have traced the functional properties of NSPC grafts over the time in the hippocampal tissue subjected to ischemia (Figure 1; Kopach et al., 2018). The post-ischemic environment influenced neurogenesis of NSPC grafts in different ways. Neuronal maturation has been delayed, both excitability and synaptogenesis, at each time points tested (for over 3 weeks in total; Figure 1). Instead, multipotent NSPC differentiation has been prompted towards the non-neuronal phenotype – we have identified the NSPC-derived glial cells as fast as within a week in the post-ischemic tissue. Such principal difference in the stem cell fate between control and post-ischemic environments implies the determinant, yet underestimated, regulatory role of the host tissue in neurogenesis of NSPCs, both differentiation profile (neuronal vs. non-neuronal) and neurophysiological maturation.Figure 1: The experimental scheme of neural stem progenitor cell (NSPC) administration in an in situ model of stroke.A carton shows the time course for functional assessment of the NSPC-derived neural maturation in a host tissue (organotypic hippocampal tissue subjected to oxygen-glucose deprivation of 10 minutes duration, with onset of the therapy after 2 hours (h) of re-oxygenation). W: Week(s).Endogenous facilitators of stem cell fate: Ischemic cell damage results in the glutamate-induced excitotoxicity followed by massive neuronal death and overwhelmed neurotoxicity. Ultimately, different signaling molecules and mediators are released those levels became dramatically heightened, overloading the extracellular matrix and activating a vast majority of signaling pathways, with an immense variety of molecular mechanisms being involved. Moreover, during neuronal cell death, necrotic, pro-apoptotic factors and mediators of inflammation activate pro-inflammatory signaling, including nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathway and others, pertinent to overactivated astrocytic response featuring the post-ischemic brain. Numerous signaling cascades can, thus, contribute to how the ischemia-subjected environment governs the fate of NSPC grafts. The notable regulatory roles in stem cell differentiation have been evidenced for phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt), Ca2+-dependent Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK)/cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element-binding protein (CREB), and Wnt signaling pathways in in vitro and in vivo studies, among the involved cAMP, protein kinase C (PKC) and CaMK pathways, and phospholipase C and D signaling activation (Le Belle et al., 2011; Telezhkin et al., 2016). Therefore, pharmacological or genetic manipulations modulating presently dissecting signaling pathways, providing multiple growth facilitators, such as neurotrophins, to support intrinsic growth capacity of differentiating neurons, neutralizing high levels of endogenous reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the post-ischemic tissue can accelerate neuronal maturation of NSPC grafts. Further, the supposed beneficial effects may include neurogenesis of the resident neural stem cells of the brain for activating endogenous self-renewal. By contrast, the non-neural (glial) NSPC differentiation, prompted up in the post-ischemic tissue, assumes the ROS-mediated regulation of NSPCs. The activated Notch signaling eliciting the latent neurogenic program in astrocytes after stoke (Magnusson et al., 2014) may have a synergistic effect on the post-ischemic NSPC differentiation to astrocytes. Functional restoration via multipotent NSPC function: Outcome after cell therapy is mediated by diverse mechanisms underlying functional improvements in the post-stroke recovery. Our study implies that NSPC therapy comprised primarily of promoted neurogenesis to a glial lineage that emerges shortly after initiating the therapy in the ischemia-subjected brain tissue (Kopach et al., 2018). This initial stage includes supplying the damaged tissue with the NSPC-derived astrocytes and oligodendrocytes – the output assuming the glia-related neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects. The stem cell-derived astrocytes enhance the viability of brain cells by secreting various neurotrophic factors and supporting cell regeneration, evidenced for improving neurological function of post-stroke brain (Jiang et al., 2013), whereas oligodendrocytes' role has been proven in re-myelination and axon regeneration, both essential to synaptic networking (Figure 2). Such glial-directed differentiation of NSPC grafts, driven by overactivated master regulators that heavily burden the post-ischemic tissue, may mirror endogenous mechanism of boosting the glia-mediated tissue clearance following ischemic neuronal cell death. As the cellular debris became cleared and pro-apoptotic and inflammatory mediators recede, multipotent NSPC neurogenesis towards neuronal maturation takes place, which is the longer lasting process. Indeed, the ability of multipotent stem cells to mature with higher efficacy to neurons in astrocyte co-cultures had been evidenced. Other roles of glial cells have included the active astrocytic contribution to synapse formation, plasticity and remodeling that should facilitate network remodeling in the post-stroke tissue.Figure 2: The current concept of NSPC-therapy in stroke-related neurodegeneration encompasses the multipotent differentiation of NSPC grafts in a host tissue for replacement of various neural phenotypes after ischemia-induced cell loss for restoring the function in multiple ways.Conclusions and future perspectives: Ischemia-induced neuronal cell death is one of the leading causes of the brain damage that results in high rate of mortality and severe disability in patients after stroke (series of strokes). The stroke-related neurodegeneration gives rise to numerous neurological disorders, including cognitive decline (vascular dementia), motor disability (paralysis), and others associated with a wide range of impairments. Massive neuronal death after stroke could be barely overcame only by pharmacological interventions, but requires also implementation of cell therapies for replacement strategies. Although the long history of stem cell research had provided conceptual advances and clinical relevance of cell-based therapy, it has been less understood the neurophysiological basis of such tremendous effects of stem cells on the post-stroke recovery of brain function. Because recovery of the brain is not a single process, it is essential to clearly define the precise timing required for maturing of neurophysiological activity, ranging from intrinsic excitability to network function, for the entirely different stem cell-derived phenotypes. Dissecting this will expand the knowledge about stem cell therapy to find how best to use multiple routes of the therapy (induced pluripotent or embryonic stem cells) for the stroke-related neurodegeneration. More work is needed on defining the regulatory role of pathophysiological environment on stem cell neurogenesis to provide the field with a meaningful consideration of cell therapy in context of promoting 'self-repair' of the post-stroke brain by engaging endogenous brain recovery mechanisms to power self-renewal. The perspective remains in accelerating neurophysiological maturation of neuronal phenotypes in the post-ischemic tissue tailored to enhancing the functional influence and, thereby, maximizing beneficial effects. Understanding the regulatory role of pathophysiological environment on stem cell grafts will foster cell therapy use to augment therapeutic interventions in stroke-related neurodegeneration and to improve ultimate outcome.",

      "abstract": "In eight patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease, loss of nerve cells from the locus caeruleus, together with reductions in capacity for function in those of the dorsal motor vagus nucleus, the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus and the nucleus basalis of Meynert in the substantia innominata are reported. These changes were more severe in three of these eight patients where mental impairment was present, though in none of these three was the number of senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles or extent of granulovacuolar degeneration greater in the hippocampus and other cerebral cortical areas than would be expected for the age of the patient. Although these same three patients had received long term L-dopa, it seems that their pathology was related to the disease process and was not drug induced. It is possible therefore, that the dementia seen in some patients with Parkinson's disease is related to degeneration and failing function of noradrenergic and cholinergic neurotransmitter systems and not always associated with the coincidental acquisition of Alzheimer type lesions (Alzheimer's disease).",

      "title": "Identifying the constructs to non-melancholic depression: stress",
      "abstract": "As noted in Chapter 1, the binary model of depression viewed one ‘type’ of depression (i. e. reactive or neurotic depression) as essentially being a response to a major or salient life-event stressor. By contrast, the other type of depression (endogenous or melancholic) was seen as a condition that occurred without any such trigger, with the term ‘endogenous’ emphasising that the depression came from ‘within’ rather than from stressors and the environment. We now turn to examine the role of life-event stressors in those with non-melancholic disorders. Life-event stressors may, theoretically, be all-explanatory and contribute totally to the onset of the depressive disorder. Terms such as ‘reactive depression’ and ‘adjustment disorder with depressed mood’ emphasise the contribution of a life event and do not recognise any predisposing or other factor. While life events may vary in their magnitude, one could posit that most of these ‘pure state’ reactions are likely to be in response to cataclysmic or extremely severe depressing events, and where it might be imagined that most people would develop such a depressive condition.",

      "title": "The Clinical Definition of Parkinson's Disease -Time for a Change?",
      "abstract": "Ever since the seminal description by James Parkinson almost 200 years ago the clinical definition of Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is anchored on the presence of motor symptoms. The internationally most widely used UK Brain Bank Criteria require the presence of bradykinesia plus at least one additional feature of tremor, rigidity or deficient postural reflexes for a clinical diagnosis of PD. On the other hand it is now widely acknowledged that a variety of non-motor symptoms form an integral part of the clinical spectrum of this disorder and that their first occurrence may antedate the manifestation of classical motor signs. This has been particularly well studied for REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) , but many patients also report on the presence of hyposmia, constipation as well as panic attacks and depression well before the appearance of any motor disability. Consistent with this, several epidemiological studies have shown an increased risk to develop PD in healthy subjects with hyposmia, constipation or depression. In addition, healthy subjects with hyposmia or RBD also have an increased prevalence of subclinical abnormalities in imaging signals commonly observed in PD, including decreased striatal DAT-SPECT binding or myocardial signal loss on MIBG-SPECT as well as hyperechogenicity of the SN midbrain region upon transcranial ultrasound. Taken together these observations not only suggest that the pathology of Parkinson’s Disease starts years before the appearance of first clinical motor symptoms and likely affects extranigral structures before producing suprathreshold nigrostriatal dopaminergic dysfunction, but they also pose new challenges regarding the definition of Parkinson’s Disease. A new definition of PD might eventually be able to differentiate three distinct phases of disease, where phase 1 would correspond to preclinical PD, where PD specific pathology is indicated by molecular, imaging or other markers in subjects free of any clinical symptoms. Phase 2 would correspond to“pre-motor”Parkinson’s Disease where early non-motor signs are present due to supra-threshold extranigral PD pathology but classical motor signs have not yet developed, while motor PD as currently defined would mark the third phase of the evolution of PD. Such a definition would open new opportunities for defining at-risk cohorts and the earliest phases of disease and might lead to new target populations for disease-modification trials.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder primarily caused by the destruction of dopamine-producing nerve cells in the substantia nigra, a critical area of the brain involved in movement control. The exact etiology remains unclear, though genetic and environmental factors may play a role. Pathologically, the disease is characterized by Lewy bodies i.e. abnormal protein aggregation within neurons. The classical symptoms of PD are resting tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability. It can significantly impact daily activities and overall quality of life in the advanced stage. The symptoms of Parkinson's disease can be discussed in Ayurveda under the clinical spectrum of Vatavyadhi including Kampavata, Sirakampa, Vepathu, and Avarana Vata. The early presentation of symptoms—such as Rigidity(Sthamba), tremors (Kampa), impaired movement (Skhalitha Gati), and reduced activity (Chesta Hani)—can be considered as Kapha aavrtha vyana. So avaranahara and srothosodhana treatments such as Udwarthana and Vamana can be advocated to eliminate excess Kapha and normalise vyana vayu. A male patient who is aged 65years who was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease presented with resting tremors, rigidity, postural instability, and difficulty in performing daily activities. Following the concept of avarana chikitsa he was administerd udwarthana, kashayadhara, and Vamana. UPDR scale was used for the pre and post evaluation of each treatment. Notable changes were found in all domains of UPDR scale.Thus, this case illustrates that avaranahara treatment modalities such as udwarthana, kashayadhara, and vamana can be effectively used in the management of rigidity-predominant Parkinson’s disease.",

      "title": "Pathogenesis of enuresis: Towards a new understanding",
      "abstract": "Enuresis was historically viewed as a primarily psychiatric disorder, but this understanding has changed dramatically since the end of the last century, when it became clear that somatic factors, such as nocturnal polyuria as a result of vasopressin deficiency, nocturnal detrusor overactivity and high arousal thresholds, all play a crucial role in enuresis pathogenesis. It has also become clear that enuresis is inherited in the majority of cases, although the correlation between genotype and enuretic phenotype is not straightforward. The standard view of enuresis as being the result of either (i) nocturnal polyuria and high arousal thresholds; or (ii) nocturnal detrusor overactivity and high arousal thresholds has become well-established, but further research now complicates the picture. First, psychological/psychiatric problems are overrepresented in enuresis, and might in a minority of cases have a causal or aggravating role. Second, nocturnal polyuria is not always linked to vasopressin deficiency. Third, nocturnal detrusor overactivity is in itself pathogenetically heterogeneous, and could be linked to constipation. Fourth, the sleep of enuretic children might be \"deep,\" but possibly also disturbed (by obstructed airways or a distended or contracting bladder). These children might have high arousal thresholds because of the enuresis instead of the other way around. The same might possibly be said about nocturnal polyuria. Taking these new insights into account, a new model of enuresis pathogenesis is presented, which is more complicated but hopefully also more true than the standard consensus.",

      "abstract": "There is much controversy concerning the incidence and nature of dementia, particularly memory impairment, in the parkinsonian patient. Specifically, a question arises with respect to the relationship of numerous personal, neurological, medication, and disability variables to this memory impairment. We administered a recently developed standardized test of recent memory functions to 53 idiopathic parkinsonian patients undergoing Sinemet treatment. Memory scores were correlated with age, sex, education, marital status, length of illness, age at onset of illness, dosage and time on medication, functional status, and the major symptoms of parkinsonism. Of all factors assessed, only increased bradykinesia correlated consistently and pervasively with impaired memory. Some possible explanations are offered.",

      "abstract": "Non-motor symptoms are common in Parkinson's disease (PD) and they represent a major source of disease burden. Several non-motor manifestations, such as rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, olfactory loss, gastrointestinal abnormalities, visual alterations, cognitive and mood disorders, are known to precede the onset of motor signs. Nonetheless, the mechanisms mediating these alterations are poorly understood and probably involve several neurotransmitter systems. The dysregulation of GABAergic system has received little attention in PD, although the spectrum of non-motor symptoms might be linked to this pathway. This Mini Review aims to provide up-to-date information about the involvement of the GABAergic system for explaining non-motor manifestations in early stages of PD. Therefore, special attention is paid to the clinical data derived from patients with isolated REM sleep behavior disorder or drug-naïve patients with PD, as they represent prodromal and early stages of the disease, respectively. This, in combination with animal studies, might help us to understand how the disturbance of the GABAergic system is related to non-motor manifestations of PD.",

Factors responsible for the lack of recognition of apathy include confusion between the presence of depression and apathy and the overlap of symptoms of apathy with the phenomenology of PD. Raising awareness of apathy in PD is important because apathy contributes to PD-related disability and has an important impact on quality of life. The neurotransmitter dopamine is central to normal motivational behavior. Therefore, PD, a disorder of primary dopamine deficiency, is an ideal model for the study of apathy and its management.",

En nous appuyant sur des avancees theoriques et methodologiques recentes, nous tentons de revisiter ces troubles de l’initiation du mouvement en termes de dysfonctionnements executifs dans la maladie de Parkinson.Dans ce but, nous avons : 1) recherche les liens entre marqueurs cliniques (akinesie et impulsivite) et troubles du controle inhibiteur ; 2) identifie les dysfonctionnements cerebraux associes au moyen de methodes electroencephalographiques innovantes permettant de localiser les sources cerebrales et d’observer la dynamique des processus cerebraux ; et 3) sonde l’origine neurochimique de cette fonction a l’aide d’un protocole pharmacologique.Nos resultats suggerent que l’impulsivite et l’akinesie sont les deux faces d’une meme piece, aux origines d’un dysfonctionnement du controle inhibiteur proactif non selectif.

DSM–IV criteria for BP II require the presence or history of one or more major depressive episodes and at least one hypomanic episode (past or present), while ICD–10 specifies two or more hypomanic/manic and depressive episodes as being necessary for bipolar affective disorder – raising the curious possibility that some might not consider first-episode mania to be part of bipolar affective disorder.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson&amp;rsquo;s disease (PD) is typically well-recognized by its characteristic motor symptoms (e.g., bradykinesia, rigidity, and tremor). The cognitive symptoms of PD are increasingly being acknowledged by clinicians and researchers alike. However, PD also involves a host of emotional and communicative changes which can cause major disruptions to social functioning. These include problems producing emotional facial expressions (i.e., facial masking) and emotional speech (i.e., dysarthria), as well as difficulties recognizing the verbal and non-verbal emotional cues of others. These social symptoms of PD can result in severe negative social consequences, including stigma, dehumanization, and loneliness, which might affect quality of life to an even greater extent than more well-recognized motor or cognitive symptoms. It is therefore imperative that researchers and clinicians become aware of these potential social symptoms and their negative effects, in order to properly investigate and manage the socioemotional aspects of PD. The present review provides an examination of the current research surrounding some of the most common social symptoms of PD and their related social consequences, and argues that proactively and adequately addressing these issues might improve disease outcomes.",

Although classic Zellweger syndrome can seldom be misdiagnosed, unless we ignore this kind of pathology altogether, the other phenotypes (neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy and infantile Refsum disease) are not always clearly delineated. Above all, the diagnosis may be difficult if we expect the patient to closely correspond to the cerebro-hepato-renal syndrome prototype.Thus, we must establish a series of crucial signs and symptoms that, taken together, make us suspect a peroxisomal disease and order the corresponding biochemical screening. In our experience, craniofacial dysmorphia may be misleading in the less severe phenotypes and is probably the most subjective feature. In contrast, an infant with widely open fontanels and axial hypotonia, in special if failure to thrive and/or hepatomegaly are associated, must be considered suspicious enough to make us think of a peroxisomal disorder and perform a metabolic screening. Later on in life, the neurological picture and psychomotor delay become more and more clear, and sensorineural blindness and deafness are virtually constant.",

The number of people with Parkinson’s disease is expected to grow mostly due to an increase in the aging population. Parkinsonian patients often require complicated dosing or titration schedules and often have multiple comorbidities that necessitate administration of therapies from multiple drug classes. Here we report two cases of parkinsonian patients who suffered acute pancreatitis. The first case presentation covers drug-induced acute pancreatitis in a patient receiving multiple medications, while the second case reveals the complexity of parkinsonian patient treatment in the clinical context of severe recurrent cholecystic acute pancreatitis. Conclusion: We can conclude that the management of Parkinson’s disease and coexistent health problems is extremely sensitive and requires a multidisciplinary team approach. It is therefore important to recognize and address the disease-specific challenges that may affect the optimal hospital care for patients with Parkinson’s disease.",

Research is now being directed at understanding better the pathophysiologic basis of these problems and developing clinical interventions that might benefit them. Cognitive and behavioral changes, including dementia, psychosis, depression, apathy, anxiety, restlessness, impulse control disorders, and compulsive disorders, are among the most devastating. Other important non-motor and non-dopaminergic symptoms probably related to involvement of the caudal brainstem and autonomic nervous system include sleep disorders, dysphagia, dysarthria, sialorrhea, orthostatic hypotension, constipation, breathing disturbances, pain, and sensory problems. In addition, there are a variety of non-neurologic conditions associated with PD, such as postural and joint deformities and dermatitis, that can be problematic for patients. This chapter describes the clinical characteristics and possible pathogenic mechanisms of these and other non-motor symptoms and focuses on possible therapeutic strategies. Some of these areas are reviewed in detail in other chapters. We do not consider gait and postural disturbances, which are extensively covered elsewhere in this volume.",

      "abstract": "Anterior interosseous nerve syndrome (Kiloh-Nevin Syndrome) is the triad of weakness of the flexor pollicis longus, the flexor digitorum profundus of the index finger, and the pronator quadratus. It is a manifestation of neuropathy affecting either the anterior interosseous nerve itself (anterior interosseous neuropathy) or its fascicles more proximally within the median nerve or brachial plexus (pseudo–anterior interosseous neuropathy). Anterior interosseous neuropathy in the presence of normal anatomic variation of the anterior interosseous nerve must be distinguished clinically from pseudo–anterior interosseous neuropathy, which can present with telltale signs in addition to the signature weaknesses of anterior interosseous nerve syndrome. A history of penetrating injury mitigates toward early exploration and nerve repair. A history of sudden onset and rapid progression, particularly when accompanied by a prodrome of pain and fatigue, suggests the presence of a focal neuritis, which typically resolves completely within 6 to 12 months without surgical intervention. If no improvement is noted within 6 to 12 months or if the neurologic condition worsens, surgical exploration may be warranted. In the presence of untreatable injury to the anterior interosseous nerve, with permanent muscular atrophy, functional tendon transfers of the flexor digitorum superficialis of the ring or middle finger or of the brachioradialis may be helpful.

Pathologically, there is a loss of nigrostriatal neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc), which is believed to represent a middle stage of the degenerative process that starts in the lower brainstem and olfactory nuclei and ascends throughout the cortex (2).

      "title": "Transtornos depressivos na doença de Parkinson de início precoce",
      "abstract": "A doenca de Parkinson (DP) e caracterizada por sinais motores comobradicinesia, tremor de repouso, rigidez e instabilidade postural. Entretanto, os sintomas nao-motores vem sendo valorizados por sua alta frequencia e impacto na vida dos pacientes. A DP de inicio precoce (inicio aos 50 anos ou menos) possui algumas peculiaridades do ponto de vista clinico, genetico e neuropatologico em relacao a DP deinicio habitual. Existem poucos estudos investigando as manifestacoes psiquiatricas da DP de inicio precoce. Os objetivos deste estudo sao verificar a frequencia de transtornos depressivos nessa populacao e avaliar possiveis variaveis clinicas e socio-demograficas associadas. Foram analisadas as propriedades psicometricas dos instrumentos utilizados para avaliar sintomas depressivos. Tambem se verificou a presenca de outros transtornos psiquiatricos e risco de suicidio. Foi realizado um estudo de corte transversal em que se procederam entrevista e exames psiquiatrico e neurologico, de forma consecutiva, em 48 pacientes com DP de inicio antes dos 50 anos inclusive(H/M;28/20). Utilizaram-se como instrumentos de avaliacao psiquiatrica o Mini-Plus, o BDI e a Ham-D, e de avaliacao neurologica, a UPDRS, o HY e a SES. Pacientes apresentaram uma idade media (± DPM) de 50 anos (± 8,0); idade media de inicio da doenca (± DPM) de 40,5 (± 7,4); UPDRS total medio (± DPM) de 46,5 (± 22,6); HY medio (± DPM) de 2,2 (± 0,6) e SES medio (± DPM) de 82,7 (± 12,1). Apenas 60,4% estavam em uso de l-dopa, com dose media (± DPM) de 634,9 mg/dia (± 281,1). Metade dospacientes exibia um transtorno do humor atual; destes, 37,5% eram depressao maior. Transtornos ansiosos estavam presentes em 66,7%, sendo que 54,2% apresentavam fobia social, 31,3%, TAG e 8,3%, transtorno do pânico. TOC ocorreu em uma frequencia de 10,4% e psicose, em 6,3%. O grupo com transtorno depressivo (depressaomaior e distimia), quando comparado com o grupo sem depressao, apresentava escores maiores em UPDRS total, UPDRS-I, UPDRS-II, BDI e Ham-D, alem de terem mais fobia social e transtorno do pânico. Genero feminino, menor nivel educacional e sintomas motores iniciados em dimidio direito estavam associados a maior gravidade de sintomas depressivos. O ponto de corte otimo do BDI (16, segundo calculo pela curva ROC) apresenta sensibilidade de 70,8% e especificidade de 83,3%. A area sob a curva ROC foi de 0,869, indicando boa propriedade discriminativa. BDI e Ham-D tem boa correlacao positiva entre si. O estudo mostra uma frequencia elevada de transtornos depressivos na DP de inicio precoce, semelhante ao que e relatado na DP de iniciohabitual. No entanto, os transtornos depressivos nessa doenca, com frequencia, passam despercebidos ou sao subtratados, apesar do grande impacto funcional. O BDI pode ser um instrumento de importante utilidade clinica no reconhecimento da depressao, e a Ham-D, na avaliacao de sua gravidade.",

      "title": "The positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia reflect impairments in the perception and initiation of action",
      "abstract": "Synopsis The CNS maintains a fundamental distinction between actions elicited by external stimuli and actions elicited by internal goals (acts of will). As a result the intact organism can monitor centrally three aspects of its own actions: (1) the action appropriate to current external stimulation (stimulus intention or meaning); (2) the action appropriate to current goals (willed intention); and (3) the action which was actually selected (corollary discharge). In Type I (acute) schizophrenic patients, intentions of will lead to actions, but these willed intentions are not monitored correctly. This apparent discrepancy between will and action gives rise to experiential (1st rank) positive symptoms (e.g. delusions of control and passivity). In Type II (chronic) patients, intentions of will are no longer properly formed and so actions are rarely elicited via this route. This gives rise to behavioural negative signs (e.g. poverty of speech). The behaviour of Type II schizophrenics has surface similarities to that shown by patients with Parkinson's disease and patients with frontal lobe lesions in that all three types of patient show a relative deficit of actions elicited by willed intentions. Dopamine blocking drugs reduce positive symptoms in Type I patients precisely because they induce Parkinsonism, i.e. reduce the likelihood of actions being initiated by willed intentions. This in turn reduces the likelihood that actions will occur for which the patient had no awareness of his intention to act.",

      "title": "Psychotic Disorders",
      "abstract": "The term “psychotic disorders” refers to a broad conceptualization of conditions including primary psychoses, such as schizophrenia and psychotic mood disorders, other disorders that are sometimes marked by psychotic features (e.g., borderline personality disorder, body dysmorphic disorder), and secondary psychotic disorders due to medical conditions or substances (e.g., alcohol withdrawal delirium). As addressed in Ketter, et al. 2004 (“Psychotic Bipolar Disorders: Dimensionally Similar to or Categorically Different from Schizophrenia?,” cited in the Debate of Dimensional versus Categorical), controversy regarding relationships among mood disorders (particularly bipolar and depressive disorders with psychotic features) and schizophrenia is ongoing. The authors argue that while the respective dimensional (e.g., psychotic bipolar disorder as intermediate between non-psychotic bipolar and schizophrenia spectrum disorders) versus categorical debate persists, a mixed dimensional/categorical approach may best help elucidate pathophysiology and treatment options. Schizophrenia, specifically, is a severe and persistent form of mental illness often marked by positive symptoms (such as excesses and distortions in thoughts and sensory/perceptual experiences such as hallucinations and delusions), negative symptoms (behavioral deficits such as avolition, asociality, anhedonia, blunted affect, and alogia), disorganized symptoms (such as disorganized speech and behavior), movement symptoms (or grossly abnormal psychomotor behavior such as catatonia), and impairments in cognition (such as memory and frontal/executive functions that include, for example, planning ability and initiation). Kring, et al. 2014 (Abnormal Psychology, cited under the Schizophrenia Spectrum) provides an excellent introductory-level overview of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. The etiological (or causal) basis of schizophrenia and related psychotic disorders remains not wholly determined. Prevailing theories, however, ascribe to a diathesis-stress model, whereby biological factors (e.g., predispositions such as genetic liability) are believed to interact with adverse environmental factors (e.g., obstetric complications; adverse, stressful life events) over the course of development toward the manifestation of illness. This article offers a historical perspective of psychotic disorders, a review of etiological/theoretical models, a description of illness epidemiology and issues pertaining to sex differences and comorbidity, an outline of diagnostic considerations, a description of the schizophrenia spectrum, an examination of available assessment tools, the role of cognition/social cognition, a review of current evidence of neurobiological disruptions in psychosis (e.g., genetics, structural and functional neuroimaging, hormones, neurotransmitters, other aspects of maldevelopment in the central nervous system), other laboratory markers (e.g., perceptual and attentional abnormalities, smooth-pursuit eye movement dysfunction), environmental factors (such as stress, toxins, and familial-expressed emotion), the importance of gene-environment interactions in psychotic disorders, and, finally, current directions pertaining to prevention and treatment (pharmacological and psychosocial). While various psychotic-related disorders are addressed, this article focuses on the schizophrenia spectrum.",

      "abstract": "Secondary demyelinating diseases comprise a wide spectrum group of pathological conditions and may either be attributed to a disorder primarily affecting the neurons or axons, followed by demyelination, or to an underlying condition leading to secondary damage of the myelin sheath. In the elderly, primary demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system (CNS), such as multiple sclerosis, are relatively uncommon. However, secondary causes of CNS demyelination may often occur and in this case, extensive diagnostic workup is usually needed. Infectious, postinfectious, or postvaccinal demyelination may be observed, attributed to age-related alterations of the immune system in this population. Osmotic disturbances and nutritional deficiencies, more commonly observed in the elderly, may lead to conditions such as pontine/extrapontine myelinolysis, Wernicke encephalopathy, and demyelination of the posterior columns of the spinal cord. The prevalence of malignancies is higher in the elderly, sometimes leading to radiation-induced, immunotherapy-related, or paraneoplastic CNS demyelination. This review intends to aid clinical neurologists in broadening their diagnostic approach to secondary CNS demyelinating diseases in the elderly. Common clinical conditions leading to secondary demyelination and their clinical manifestations are summarized here, while the current knowledge of the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms is additionally presented.",

      "abstract": "Sleep disturbances are among the most common disabling nonmotor symptoms of Parkinson disease (PD). Recently, awareness of sleep disorders related to PD has increased, reflecting their significant negative impact on the quality of life of the patient. However, sleep disturbances are still often under-recognized. In PD, multiple factors are associated with sleep disturbances; impaired arousal systems and sleep structure as disease-related changes, nocturnal motor symptoms, hallucinations and psychosis, pain, nocturia, depressive symptoms and dopaminergic medication can all cause insomnia. Further, these factors can coexist and influence each other during the course of the disease. In addition, sleep-related breathing disorder, restless legs syndrome (RLS) and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) can also lead to impaired sleep. Some idiopathic RBD patients have been associated with a risk for developing neurodegenerative diseases, including PD. Therefore, early diagnosis of RBD may have significant clinical implications for neuroprotective strategies. Several studies have revealed an increased incidence of RLS in PD patients compared to the general population. The favorable responses to dopaminergic medications in treating both RLS and PD suggest shared pathophysiologies between the two diseases; however, neuroimaging studies of dopaminergic systems remain inconclusive. In this review, we discuss the current understanding of sleep disturbances in PD and the existing treatments.",

      "abstract": "Background: Primary Parkinson syndrome is mostly treated by dopaminergic drugs, while the progression of the disease is not altered. Some non-dopaminergic are available, which are administered only after the Parkinsonian symptoms get worse. Objective: The objective of this review is to give basic results in order to compare a dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic pharmacotherapy in Parkinson’s disease and to control whether the add-on pharmacotherapy with non-dopaminergic drugs can inhibit the progression of the disease. Methods: In primary Parkinson syndrome, the altered activity of classical neurotransmitters and neuropeptides in the extrapyramidal system is summarized and up-dated. Anatomical studies on neural networks in the basal ganglia are mentioned. The direct, motor facilitatory pathway (D1 dopaminergic neurons) from the substantia nigra to the thalamus, via the internal globus pallidus, and the indirect, motor inhibitory pathway via D2 dopaminergic neurons have been considered. These established anatomical pathways have been brought in line with the neural interactions derived from neurotransmitter balances or imbalances. Besides, preclinical and clinical studies of effective non-dopaminergic anti-Parkinsonian drugs are reviewed. Results: It can be hypothesized that glutamatergic neurons enhance dopamine deficiency in the substantia nigra and putamen through an increased presynaptic inhibition mediated by NMDA receptors. In the putamen, 5-HT2A serotonergic neurons counteract D2 dopaminergic neurons and A2A adenosine neurons antagonize D2 dopaminergic neurons by activating glutamatergic neurons, which presynaptically inhibit via subtype 5 of metabotropic glutamatergic receptors, D2 dopaminergic neurons. In the extrapyramidal system, an up-dated neural network, which harmonizes established anatomical pathways with derived neural interactions, is presented. In Parkinson’s disease, a question should be answered, whether a combination of dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic drugs can promote an increased motor and non-motor functioning. Conclusion: A mono-target pharmacotherapy (using only dopaminergic drugs) and a multi-target pharmacotherapy (i.e. by combining dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic drugs) are compared. The alternate administration of dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic anti-Parkinsonian drugs, administered at different times during the day, must be tested in order to inhibit the progression of the disease. Assessment tools can be used to evaluate motor and cognitive functions. Moreover, imaging examination techniques can be also applied to control the course of the disease.",

      "title": "MASGUTOVA METHOD OF REFLEX INTEGRATION FOR CHILDREN WITH CEREBRAL PALSY",
      "abstract": "Childhood Cerebral Palsy – the group of diseases concerned with motor disorders as the result of brain damage or dysfunction of certain brain centers – is usually acquired during the first years of life, at the time when the system of primary movement patterns is developing. Primary movements are genetically programmed for protection and survival, and also for the development of the conscious movement system. Developmentally their role is to support: - maturation of the nervous system (synaptogenesis, myelination, and brain plasticity) - brain function (cognitive development, emotional maturation) - sensory-motor integration. Dysfunctions of motor development and sensory-motor integration in the child with CP are a reflection of the type of neurological insult and the developmental stage of the infant/child when the neurological insult occurred. The developmental stages can be divided into prenatal (in utero); natal (during the birth process); or postnatal (after birth but during the first years of life). Each developmental stage is vulnerable to specific neurological insults. Prenatal palsy can be caused by infection, toxicity in the fetus, or compromised health in the pregnant mother. Some primary motor patterns and reflexes, such as Trunk Extension, Automatic Gait, Grasp, Swallowing and Sucking develop in utero. Prenatal brain damage will cause poor expression of these reflexes and adversely impact the next stage of development. Natal palsy is generally caused by neurological insult during birth: a consequence of premature birth, sudden deliveries, narrow pelvis of the mother, use of forceps during birth, etc. Natal trauma can negatively affect the activation of primary motor patterns and reflexes characteristic of a normal successful birth. In such cases the expression of these genetic programs will be abnormal. The primary movements and reflexes of childbirth, such as Head Righting, Perez, Tonic Labyrinthine (TLR) in extension, Bauer Crawling, Sequential Side Rotation, Spinning, and Sucking may be dysfunctional. Postnatal palsy is often caused by an infection with encephalitic symptoms. Other causes include childhood cranial injury, central nervous system injury, and poor systemic health. Infant motor patterns and reflexes will be stressed by postnatal CP, and may develop dysfunctionally or pathologically. Dynamic reflexes (e.g., Grasp, Hands Pulling, Automatic Gait, Sequential Side Rotation, Spinning); positional reflexes (e.g., Asymmetrical Tonic Neck Reflex [ATNR] Symmetrical Tonic Neck Reflex [STNR], Babkin Palmomental, Tonic Labyrinthine Reflex",

The problems range from nocturnal issues such as difficulty with sleep initiation, sleep fragmentation, disturbance of circadian rhythm, and rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, to daytime problems such as excessive daytime sleepiness. Frequent nighttime awakening and sleep disruption are the most common sleep problems in Parkinson's disease. Dopamine plays an important role in maintaining wakefulness. To improve sleep in Parkinson's disease, it is important to achieve the critical balance of adequate dopaminergic therapy and control of symptoms. Increased dopaminergic agents can cause dyskinesias and painful dystonia, and undertreatment can cause nighttime akinesia, rigidity, and worse quality of sleep. Other nondopaminergic drugs commonly used in Parkinson's disease can also affect sleep. In patients with advanced Parkinson's disease, deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus has a favorable impact on sleep quality and sleep architecture.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is an extremely complex motor disorder due to the lack of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. and other dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic regions of the brain. The high rate of misdiagnosis in Parkinson's disease often causes patients to miss out on the best treatment opportunities. Since some of the symptoms of Parkinson's disease are mild in the initial stages and become severe over time, it is particularly important to correctly diagnose Parkinson's disease timely. The traditional tremor detection method of Parkinson's disease is more complex and the misdiagnosis rate is high. Methods based on physiological signals such as Local field potential (LFP), Electromyographic signal (EMG) and EEG signal et.al and research by using the machine learning strategies including the traditional machine learning and deep leaning methods are increasing. Get a precise diagnosis for Parkinson's disease, this paper analyzes physiological signals and machine learning methods that commonly used in PD detection, which may provide theoretical and practical references to future studies.",

      "title": "Management of patients with neuropathic pain",
      "abstract": "Background: Neuropathic pain diseases commonly treated with pain medicine are postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPNP), complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS), and chronic pain after spinal surgery. Diagnosis and treatment of these neuropathic pain diseases is an arduous task, and there is a need to improve the understanding of these entities.Current Concepts: PHN is diagnosed when pain persists for more than 3 months after the healing of herpes zoster rashes, and this disease is commonly encountered in the elderly population. The pathophysiology of DPNP is ischemia of nerve tissue due to microvascular damage. In addition to sensory nerves, DPNP can also result in changes in motor and autonomic nerves. CRPS is a chronic intractable pain disorder, and is classified into types 1 and 2. Type 1 CRPS is diagnosed when there is no evidence of nerve damage while type 2 CRPS shows evidence of nerve damage. However, the signs and symptoms do not differ depending on the type. Chronic pain after spinal surgery is characterized by persistent back pain even after one or more spinal surgeries. This neuropathic pain occurs in the lower back or leg region.Discussion and Conclusion: The most crucial step in the management of patients with neuropathic pain is to suspect and diagnose if the pain has the characteristics of any pain-related disease. Although the etiology and pathophysiology may differ, the treatment of neuropathic pain remains the same and includes both conservative and interventional approaches. Neuropathic pain diseases often become chronic in nature, and thus, it is important to establish a treatment plan which aims at decreasing pain, improving patient’s functionality and attaining an acceptable quality of life.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by hypokinetic motor features; however, patients also display non-motor symptoms like sleep disorders. The standard treatment for PD is dopamine replacement with L-DOPA; however, many symptoms, including gait deficits and sleep disorders are unresponsive to L-DOPA. Notably, these symptoms have been linked to aberrant activity in the pedunculopontine nucleus (PPN). Of late, clinical trials involving PPN deep brain stimulation (DBS) have been employed to alleviate gait deficits. Although preclinical evidence implicating PPN cholinergic neurons in gait dysfunction was initially promising, DBS trials fell short of expected outcomes. One reason for the failure of DBS may be that the PPN is a heterogenous nucleus that consists of GABAergic, cholinergic, and glutamatergic neurons that project to a diverse array of brain structures. Second, DBS trials may have been unsuccessful because PPN neurons are susceptible to mitochondrial dysfunction, lewy body pathology, and degeneration in PD. Therefore, pharmaceutical or gene-therapy strategies targeting specific PPN neuronal populations or projections could better alleviate intractable PD symptoms. Unfortunately, how PPN neuronal populations and their respective projections influence PD motor and nonmotor symptoms remains enigmatic. Herein we discuss normal cellular and neuroanatomical features of the PPN, the differential susceptibility of PPN neurons to PD-related insults, and we give an overview of literature suggesting a role for PPN neurons in motor and sleep deficits in PD. Finally, we identify future approaches directed towards the PPN for the treatment of PD motor and sleep symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Definitions Developmental dyslexia, also known as specific reading disability, is an unexpected difficulty in learning to read that occurs in the otherwise normal child. Rudel1 suggests it be defined by both exclusionary and inclusionary criteria. Her strict definition requires that five criteria be met: 1) The child must have no major neurologic abnormalities, such as overt cerebral palsy. Affected children may and often do have \"soft\" signs on neurologic examination, however. 2) The major sensory functions must be normal; the child cannot be blind or deaf. Practically speaking, children who are blind or deaf or who have cerebral palsy may be dyslexic if they have reading difficulties disproportionate to their other academic and intellectual abilities. 3) The child should have no major psychiatric problems. Problems with self-esteem are often, however, a reactive secondary issue in the child who has a learning disability. 4) Normal intelligence is required, using either a verbal or nonverbal measure. Children who have dyslexia often also have language problems. Hence, verbal intelligence scores may not reflect overall intellectual abilities accurately. 5) Finally, the dyslexic child must have been in a social and educational environment conducive to learning to read. Several studies of inner-city school children have demonstrated that enrichment programs help some nonreaders become readers, demonstrating the importance of teaching techniques.",

It occurs when nerve cells do not produce enough of an important chemical in the brain, known as dopamine. It usually starts around the age of 60, but it may appear before and until now a cure for Parkinson's disease has not been discovered.Through this research work, we aim to determine the quality of life of patients with Parkinson's Disease, as well as the depressive symptoms present in them according to their epidemiological characteristics. A higher prevalence was determined in male patients and a peak incidence between 59 and 61 years of age. It is important to emphasize that one of the positive points of this study is that, despite being limited among an age range, it has a good number of \r\npatients, so the results are statistically significant. However, because it is limited to a single hospital center, it does not reflect the reality of patients nationwide. Regarding the prevalence of depressive symptoms, the main factors determined by patients are anhedonia, sleep disorders and decreased libido, present in at least 1 in two cases each. In the same way, it was reported by the study published by the Journal Neurology, in which these symptoms were established as the predominant ones of psychiatric and depressive characteristics.",

Some clues in the history are sudden onset, intermittent time course, variability of manifestation over time, childhood trauma, and history of other somatic symptoms. Anxiety and depression are common, but not necessarily more than in the general population. Although there are no tests currently capable of demonstrating whether symptoms are willfully produced, there may not be a clear categorical difference between voluntary and involuntary symptoms. The prognosis of an FND is linked to early diagnosis and symptom duration, but unfortunately, the majority of the patients are diagnosed after considerable delays.A positive diagnosis of FNDs can be made on the basis of history and neurological signs without reliance on psychological stressors. Past sensitizing events and neurobiological abnormalities contribute to the pathogenesis of FNDs. Physical rehabilitation and psychological interventions alone or in combination are helpful in the treatment.",

Psychosis in PD is predominantly medication induced and all antiparkinsonian drugs in current use are capable of producing PDP. Dementia and depression are strong predictors of risk for the development of PDP. Hallucinations and delusions can occur at any time in the course of PD, but they are most commonly seen as a later complication in susceptible individuals. Visual hallucination is the most common feature of PDP, although other types of hallucination have also been reported. Delusions, particularly paranoid type, are less common but represent a more serious clinical problem. The mechanisms responsible for producing PDP are not fully elucidated but important advances have been made. Treatment should be approached in a stepwise manner. A triggering factor, such as infection, should be excluded first. Then careful tapering of antiparkinsonian medication, starting with adjunctive medication, should be undertaken. If increased motor disability prevents adequate dosage reduction, quetiapine is a reasonable first-choice antipsychotic agent followed by clozapine.",

      "abstract": "We report two cases of neuromyelitis optica (NMO) associated with primary Sjögren's syndrome (pSS), comparing the clinical and laboratory features of these predominant neurological patients and reporting their different outcome. NMO - a severe demyelinating disorder of the central nervous system - primarily affects the spinal cord and optic nerves, resulting in longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis and/or optic neuritis. Our patients had a late pSS diagnosis, due to the absence of sicca syndrome and specific Sjögren serology in the early stages of their diseases, when the neurological symptoms prevailed. Many NMO patients have an accompanying autoimmune disease, most commonly Sjögren syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus or a related profile of non-organ-specific autoantibodies. Neurologic involvement occurs in approximately 20% of patients with pSS, usually preceding the diagnosis (in 75-80% of the cases) [1,2]. The frequency of both neurologic manifestations (revealing pSS) and negative autoimmune serology, especially in the event of CNS involvement, could explain why underlying pSS is misdiagnosed [3,4]. Screening for pSS should be systematically performed in cases of acute or chronic myelopathy and/or cranial nerve involvement, mainly because these patients have a severe outcome. The presence of the anti-aquaporin4 antibodies, besides anti-Ro and anti-La, in both reported cases, is intriguing and raises the question of whether we are facing two distinct diseases or the NMO is just complicating an unusually less expressive Sjögren's syndrome subtype.",

      "abstract": "REM sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a parasomnia characterized by dream-enacting behavior and loss of muscle atonia during REM sleep. Idiopathic RBD occurs in the absence of any neurological disease or other possible cause, is male-predominant and its clinical course is generally chronic progressive. Secondary RBD may be related to neurodegenerative disorders such as multiple system atrophy, Parkinson's disease and Lewy body dementia. Recent long-term prospective studies have shown that 30% to 65% of patients with idiopathic RBD will eventually develop a neurodegenerative disorder with the rate of emergence depending on the length of the follow-up period. RBD may therefore be one of the earliest signs of and/or a long-term predictor for neurodegenerative disorders. Because RBD antecedes the development of these disorders by several years or decades, its recognition may enable the delay or prevention of neurodegenerative disorders through the early application of neuroprotective or disease-modifying therapies in the future.",

      "abstract": "Drug-induced psychiatric conditions are a common and severe problem in the treatment of patients with Parkinson's disease. Psychotic symptoms are the most frequent reason for nursing home placement of patients with Parkinson's disease. The psychotic symptoms seem to present themselves in a continuum where alterations in dreaming patterns often precede visual hallucinations, which often progress into delusional syndromes and, finally, into confusional organic syndromes. When evaluating a patient on dopaminergic treatment, it is important to inquire systematically about abnormal sleep related phenomena, for these are important clues in the early detection of psychotic symptoms. The pathogenesis of the psychotic symptoms is not yet fully understood but complex adaptations of various neurotransmitter systems seem to be involved. In the treatment of these drug-induced psychotic symptoms, the atypical antipsychotic drug clozapine plays an important role. Drug-induced mania, hypersexuality and anxiety, although less frequent than the psychotic symptoms, also occur as a complication of dopaminergic treatment. Depressive symptoms, although common in Parkinson's disease, are less likely to occur as a side effect of the drug treatment.",

This chapter reviews these conditions through the lens of neuropsychiatric features, while orienting students and providers to the cognitive background of the characteristic motor and imaging findings that co-occur with these diseases. It begins by reviewing conditions caused by abnormal accumulation of alpha-synuclein, including Parkinson’s disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, and multiple system atrophy. Characteristic cognitive, motoric, and other symptom presentations are reviewed, along with case examples to help differentiate these conditions. Next, the authors discuss the characteristic cognitive and behavioral features of the atypical parkinsonian conditions known as progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal ganglionic degeneration, and conclude with a discussion of the continued diagnostic uncertainties and heterogeneities in the presentation of these types of movement disorders.",

While motor symptoms take center stage in Lewy body disease, these neuropsychiatric symptoms also bear significant importance, necessitating thorough assessment and treatment. Proactively addressing these issues through appropriate interventions can substantially enhance patients' overall quality of life. In this chapter, I will explore the clinical manifestations, underlying brain pathology, and treatment strategies related to these varied neuropsychiatric symptoms. Differing somewhat from symptoms seen in the realm of psychiatry, these symptoms require consideration of behavior rooted in organic factors rather than solely psychological ones. The neuropsychiatric symptoms observed in PD and other Lewy body diseases serve as a gateway to explore the realm of organic mental phenomena.",

      "abstract": "D is a movement disorder, which is defined as an “involuntary” sustained muscle contraction affecting one or more sites of the human body. Frequently it originates twisting and respective movements or abnormal postures.1 The dystonic phenomenon occurs during the wake state and increases with fatigue and stress, while it improves with relaxation, hypnosis, and sleep. Childhood dystonia is characterized by a heterogeneous group with strong inherited background. Dystonia is classified according to the etiology.2 The dystonic phenomenon is the only symptom in primary dystonia. In dystonia-plus or secondary dystonia, other neurological abnormalities are also associated consisting of parkinsonism and myoclonus that are probably due to acquired exogenous causes and heredodegenerative disorders.3 In addition, myoclonus, which is sudden and brief muscular contraction,4 might be associated with dystonia in some conditions, including dystonia-plus, neurodegenerative disorders, and secondary dystonia caused by stroke, anoxia, infections, and toxins. We report a case of delayed dystonia associated myoclonus in an adolescent girl, which was secondary to a neonatal anoxia, and we discuss clinical and therapeutic features. A 12-year-old girl was referred to our department for abnormal movement of the right arm. She was the fourth child of unrelated parents, no history of neurological problems was elicited in family members. She was born at term with prolonged labor, neonatal distress with cyanosis that required intensive care. Her psychomotor development was normal, no particular medical problem or school difficulties were noticed until her 12th birthday, thereafter, she developed abnormal posture of the right upper limb with sudden jerks of the hand making limited daily movements. The neurological examination showed dystonia of the right upper limb with myoclonic movements making prehension and writing difficult. This also consisted of adduction of the shoulder, extension, and internal rotation of the elbow and wrist with flexion of the metacarpophalangeal joints, and extension of the interphalangeal joints. The ophthalmological examination did not reveal KayserFleischer ring. The abdominal examination did not reveal any hepatosplenomegaly, and the cardiac, pulmonary, and dermatological examinations were all normal. Magnetic resonance imaging showed high signals in the left caudate nucleus, rolandic, and occipital area involving both cortical and sub-cortical sites (Figure 1). Routine laboratory assessments including blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, urea, creatine, glucose, transaminases, and prothrombin were all found normal. Considering dystonia etiology, investigating metabolic diseases including Wilson disease, organic aciduria, and mitochondrial disease were performed. Urinary and plasmatic copper, ceruloplasmin, CSF, and plasmatic lactic and pyruvic acids, showed all normal levels. The chromatography of urine organic acids was normal, and the anti-DNA autoimmune markers were negative. A muscle biopsy was performed and the histological study did not reveal any fibers disorder. The clinical examination and negative studies completed, suggested a late onset dystonia following neonatal anoxia. Therefore, levodopa treatment was decided with daily dose of 600 mg over 3 months. However, this treatment was interrupted later considering the negative response. Six months later, the symptomatology worsened and she stopped going to school as she became unable to write. The clinical examination found the initial dystonic posture more pronounced with extension to the left upper limb. In addition, dystonia of the left arm was less manifest than on the right side. Nevertheless, she was walking normally without any dystonia of lower limbs and without any extrapyramidal signs. Magnetic resonance imaging showed identical lesions to the first examination. The first description of delayed onset dystonia was by Saint Hilaire et al,5 and several reports have been published describing the clinical presentation with delay ranging from 121 years, and imaging abnormalities were Clinical Notes",

As usually accepted, this term is limited to a syndrome consisting of the sudden appearance of symptoms and signs of involvement of the central nervous system in a patient with early (primary or secondary) syphilis, who has received an amount of treatment insufficient to eradicate the infection, and has then lapsed from treatment. The clinical manifestations are varied, but usually consist of an acute or subacute syphilitic meningitis, commonly with, but sometimes without, focal lesions of the cranial nerves. The early literature on this subject was filled with a controversy as to whether these lesions were caused by the harmful effects of arsenicals or by syphilis. The controversy has long since been settled. Neurorecurrences are due, not to arsphenamine, but to too little arsphenamine; the symptoms usually disappear",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) or Parkinsonism is an age-related progressive neurological disorder because of the deterioration of the nerve cells inside the substantia nigra, and it is characterized by three cardinal signs: rigidity, resting tremor, and bradykinesia. The major aim of therapy is to control the disorder's signs and symptoms, delay the progression of the disease, and enhance the affected person's quality of life (QoL). This can be achieved by the use of medication (drugs) and surgery. Pharmacotherapy of PD refers to utilizing drugs to replace, mimic, or potentiate the action of depleted endogenous brain's dopamine and aims at delaying the progression of the disorder, reducing the drugs' adverse effects, and improving the patient's QoL. Drugs employed in the treatment of PD are broadly divided into two categories: dopaminergic system-acting drugs and cholinergic system-acting drugs. However, levodopa remains the first choice drug for the management of Parkinsonism to date. Despite the availability of drugs for the management of Parkinsonism, the progressive nature of the disorder has resulted in their failure to confer lasting therapeutic efficacy as the majority of the features of the disease become resistant to these drugs. Also, severe adverse effects with little or lack of enhancement in the patient's QoL often accompany the use of multiple drug regimens, hence limiting the attainment of the overall goal of pharmacotherapy.",

      "abstract": "develop schizophrenia and is generally not longer than a few years, with an average duration of about one year [7]. Thus it has been seen as a legitimate target for detection and intervention, with the aim of prevention of onset, or at least amelioration or delay of onset [8]. This is the background to the ‘ prodromal intervention ’ fi eld. However, even apparent prodromal symptoms lack specifi city. Characteristic prodromal features include sleep disturbance, irritability, lowered mood, anxiety and decline in school or work performance [7,9]. This clinical picture could be the result of a number of conditions, such as major depression, substance abuse and physical illness, as well as a psychotic prodrome. Even attenuated or isolated psychotic symptoms may not necessarily progress to a frank psychotic disorder, as these are now known to be quite common in the general population [10 – 14]. There are two implications of this lack of specifi city. First, is the recognition that a prodrome cannot be diagnosed as such prospectively, and that the terms ‘ prodrome ’ and ‘ prodromal ’ should not be used to refer to this clinical picture or those apparently presenting with it. This is more than pure semantics. Adoption of the term ‘ prodromal ’ to refer to individuals implies that they are on the path to schizophrenia. It suggests that the ‘ process ’ has already begun. Instead, as McGorry [15] has pointed out, terminology such as ‘ at risk mental state ’ should be used, to highlight that a person presenting with apparent prodromal symptoms may be at increased risk of onset of psychotic disorder within a brief time frame (1 – 2 years), but that onset is not inevitable. The second implication is that there needs to be some narrowing of the defi nition of ‘ at risk ’ so that those so identifi ed truly have a high likelihood of onset of fi rst episode psychosis within a brief period of time. One strategy to achieve this aim has been the development of the ultra high risk (UHR) criteria. These have been described elsewhere [8,16,17]. Essentially, there are three groups identifi ed: (i) attenuated psychotic symptoms",

      "title": "Challenges in the diagnosis of Wilson disease",
      "abstract": "Abstract: The understanding and management of Wilson disease (WD) have dramatically improved since the first description of the disease by K. Wilson more than a century ago. However, the persistent long delay between the first symptoms and diagnosis emphasizes challenges in diagnosing earlier this copper overload disorder. As a treatable disease, WD should be detected early in the course of the disease by any health professionals at any care level, but the rare prevalence of the disease explains the lack of awareness of referring physicians. The most important challenge is to train physicians to recognize atypical or rare symptoms of WD that will lead to discuss the diagnosis more systematically. Atypia can come from the age of onset, the liver [non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) presentation], the central or peripheral nervous system (neuropathy, epilepsy, sleep disorders…) or may be due to lesions of other organs (renal manifestations, osteo-articular disorders or endocrine disturbances). Isolated biological anomalies, rare radiological findings or inadequate interpretation of copper test may also lead to misdiagnosis. The second challenge is to confirm the diagnosis faster and more effectively so as not to delay the initiation of treatment, and expand family screening as the genetic prevalence is higher than previously expected. Generalization of the exchangeable copper assay and the next generation sequencing (NGS) are two promising ways to overcome this ultimate challenge. By drawing attention to the earliest and rare symptoms and to new biomarkers and diagnostic tools, we hope that this article will increase diagnostic awareness and reduce delays so that patients can start their treatment earlier in the course of the illness and thus have a better disease prognosis.",

Pseudodementia is a term used clinically to describe symptoms that resemble dementia but are caused by other conditions (most frequently depression), rather than being recognised as an official diagnosis. Pseudodementia is characterised by a cognitive impairment that mimics dementia but which does not have its origin in neurological degeneration, deriving instead from functional psychiatric conditions. This condition is more commonly observed in older adults (particularly those over the age of 50 or 60 years), and its risk factors overlap with those for depression. Pseudodementia is essentially characterised by deficits in memory, executive function and speech and, therefore, can easily be confused with dementia, although there are aspects that allow its differentiation. Diagnosing pseudodementia can be difficult, especially as there is significant overlap between its symptoms and those of other conditions. However, it is important to recognise characteristic aspects of this disorder, as its correct identification is essential for proper treatment.",

      "title": "Schizophrenia and anorexia nervosa – reciprocal relationships. A literature review",
      "abstract": "Although schizophrenia and anorexia nervosa are seemingly very distinct psychiatric disorders, their symptoms are connected by various types of relationships. The present article reviews the literature and recapitulates the views of various authors on the links between these two disorders. Symptoms of anorexia may 1) precede the onset of psychosis; 2) evolve in its active phase or more rarely manifest in remission; and, conversely, 3) psychotic symptoms may occur transiently in the course of anorexia nervosa. When anorexia precedes the manifestation of psychosis, symptoms of anorexia can be treated as a component of the prodromal phase of schizophrenia. Another possibility of co-existence of a psychosis (e.g., schizophrenia) with anorexia is when the eating disorder syndrome manifests at the same time as the full-blown psychotic syndrome. In such cases, when the symptoms of the two disorders occur simultaneously, it is often difficult to say whether the patient is suffering from schizophrenia, in the course of which anorexia has arisen secondary to psychotic symptoms or whether he/she is suffering from anorexia during which he/she has developed psychotic symptoms, usually thematically associated with eating. Studies published so far, mainly case reports, point to the complex nature of the interrelationships between schizophrenia and anorexia nervosa. Further research is needed to conclusively explain the relationships between psychotic disorders and anorexia nervosa, which would allow physicians to use more effective methods of treatment in this group of patients.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson disease (PD) is a multisystem disease clinically characterized by variegated motor and non-motor (NM) deficits. Many of these NM alterations antedate motor dysfunctions, representing a preclinical phase spanning 20 or even more years before the diagnosis of PD is established, and then worsen with disease progression. The clinical spectrum of NM symptoms in PD and atypical parkinsonism has been repeatedly reviewed [1-6]. Their causes of NM symptoms in PD are multifactorial and linked to widespread distribution of α-synuclein (αSyn), the basic pathological protein aggregated in neurons, neurites, presynaptic terminals and glia as hallmarks in PD and other synucleinopathies [7]. αSyn aggregation in presynaptic terminals that predates the formation of Lewy bodies (LB) and dystrophic neurites and does not necessarily correlate with LB pathology [8] is not restricted to specific dopaminergic brainstem nuclei, but involves multiple areas of the central, autonomic, and peripheral nervous system, the retina, sympathetic and parasympathetic ganglia, nerves, skin, salivary glands, and other organs [9,10]. The pathology of NM symptoms in PD has been reviewed recently [11], and its sequential part in the disease progression has been presented [12]. This is a brief update of the relations between αSyn deposition and the most frequent NM symptoms, and a discussion of animal models and their probable relevance for NM aspects of PD.",

The loss of post‐ganglionic myocardial sympathetic nerve fibers is a prominent feature of autonomic dysfunction in such disorders. 123 I‐metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy that visualizes catecholaminergic terminals in vivo is a biomarker used to detect cardiac sympathetic degeneration. Abnormal MIBG uptake has been consistently reported in Lewy body disorders. Some studies agree in the notion that increasing bradykinesia is related with an incremental cardiac sympathetic denervation, whereas tremor is not closely linked to cardiac denervation. “Atypical” parkinsonian syndromes, including Multiple System Atrophy, Progressive Supranuclear Palsy, and others, show modest reductions of cardial MIBG uptake. MIBG scintigraphy is moderately sensitive and specific in differentiating Parkinson's disease from such syndromes. Conversely, its sensitivity and specificity might be better in cognitively impaired patients, helping differential diagnosis between Dementia with Lewy Bodies, and Alzheimer disease. Confounding factors (comorbidities, comedications) should be carefully controlled before analyzing MIBG scintigraphy. © 2009 Movement Disorder Society",

The most important motor disturbances of the disease are bradykinesia (slowing down of movement), hypokinesia (poverty of movement), rigidity (muscle stiffness), tremor and postural instability. Besides these well-known motor symptoms, non-motor symptoms may develop, such as depression, cognitive impairment and psychosis. Psychotic symptoms constitute a relatively common but nevertheless serious complication, with visual hallucinations and paranoid delusions often being most prominent. These symptoms are important contributors to patient and caregiver distress and are often important risk factors for nursing home placement. Exogenous (related to therapeutic interventions) factors are of major importance but endogenous (related to the disease process itself) factors might also contribute to the development of psychotic symptoms in PD. Therapeutic strategies comprise reduction of antiparkinsonian treatment, cholinesterase inhibitors and atypical antipsychotics. As psychotic symptoms in PD are often influenced by both endogenous and exogenous factors, a combination of strategies may be chosen.",

In addition to motor and non-motor manifestations of Parkinson’s disease, there are a number of symptoms, including speech disorders and other cognitive impairments. The most common speech symptoms are bradylalia, dysarthria, hypophonia and impaired prosody. Cognitive changes that occur in the prodromal phase of PD include impairment in executive functions and working memory, followed by impairment in attention and verbal fluency, and that is before the motor characteristics of PD become visible. The aim of the study is to present the case of a 74-year-old patient with Parkinson’s disease who has speech and language difficulties and atypical speech disfluency. Diagnostic processing was performed using a clinical battery of tests for speech – language assessment and neuropsychological assessment. The results of the speech – language assessment indicate significantly reduced intelligence due to non-specific speech disfluency and inaccurate articulation, difficulty in organizing spontaneous expression and understanding grammatical structures, impaired phonemic verbal fluency and difficulties in receptive vocabulary. Neuropsychological processing indicated diffuse deterioration of the examined cognitive functioning to be larger than expected when taking ito consideration the age and probably good premorbid abilities of this person.",

They can be classified in some ways, of which we highlight those in terms of its localization or etiology. Psychogenic dystonia is an exclusion diagnosis, which is infradiagnosed due to the difficulty to specify the disorder. We proposed a review over its use in usual clinical practice, in relation to the symptoms, difficulties of diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. Development: The inconsistency of symptoms and incongruity with the classical symptomatology, and so the poor therapeutic answer to usual treatments set out to the diagnosis. Its psychiatric comorbility with anxiety, depression, somatizations, conversion symptomatology or personality traits would support the diagnosis; but its presence is not strictly necessary. Psychiatric characteristics are sometimes seen trough the basis of movement disorder of neurological origin. Symptoms of depression or anxiety are related with a better prognosis, while cronification, insidious onset, the diagnosis of hypocondria, the factitious disorder or the simulation are related with poor prognosis. It's recommended a combined pharmacologic-psycotherapic treatment. Recent studies with antidepressants have shown encouraging results. Conclusions: It's very important to make a correct differential diagnosis that allows to approach to the disorder to avoid iatrogenia o unnecessary invasive tests.",

Parkinson disease occurs with the loss of brain cells which are generating dopamine. The most important primary motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease are shaking of hands, slowness of movement, and speech changes. Sound changes are not recognized at the early stages of the disease while it becomes evident at the progressive stages. However, speech changes can be detected with some acoustic parameters. This study aims to detect Parkinson’s disease by using voice recordings. In this study, 342 voice recordings that belong to 174 healthy subjects and 168 Parkinson’s disease patients are used. 21 features are extracted from each voice record. The classification of subjects as healthy or with Parkinson disease is achieved by using logistic regression, k-nearest neighboring and ensemble gentle boost techniques. Furthermore, ten-fold and leave-one-out cross validation techniques are applied to improve the performance and reliability of the classifier. Sensitivity, specificity, maximum and average accuracy values are calculated to evaluate the success of the system. The obtained results show that the proposed system can be utilized by the neurologists to diagnose Parkinson’s disease at its early stages.",

The first problem is to separate those suffering from a disturbance which may be relieved entirely, or in part, by an intelligent therapeutic regime, from those in whom such an effort would be wasted. In the past it has been customary to depend upon casual observation as the deciding factor and many times this is sufficient. If, however, one uses bone development as an index of metabolic speed, irrespective of the other findings, he gets an entirely new viewpoint of the subject. Proceeding in this manner, it will be discovered that all mentally defective or emotionally unstable children fall into three main groups, i.e. (1) those having normal bone development; (2) those having definitely retarded bone development, and (3) those having definitely advanced bone development. 1 shall limit this discussion to the first two classes; maerogenitosomia and other vague conditions producing abnormally rapid development are beyond the scope of this paper. I am of the opinion that any metabolic disorder in childhood, when sufficiently severe to produce mental or emotional symptoms, will be reflected in the bone development. The first group then may be excluded.",

      "abstract": "More than 20 studies of schizophrenia have found a three-factor model of symptom complexes or syndromes consisting of hallucinations/delusions, disorganization of thought and behavior, and negative symptoms. Several lines of evidence suggest that these syndromes relate to neurobiological differences. We examined the relationship of these three syndromes to neurological signs.The relationships among the subscales of the Neurological Evaluation Scale and hallucinations/delusions, disorganization, and the deficit syndrome were examined in 83 clinically stable outpatients with schizophrenia. Patients with the deficit syndrome have enduring, idiopathic (or primary) negative symptoms.Each of the three syndromes had a distinctive pattern of relationships to neurological signs. Disorganization was significantly related to the total score on the Neurological Evaluation Scale, to sensory integration, and to the sequencing of complex motor acts. The deficit syndrome was significantly related to sensory integration only. Neither hallucinations/delusions nor a continuous measure of negative symptoms derived from the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (that measured both primary and secondary negative symptoms, as well as enduring and transient symptoms) was related to any of the Neurological Evaluation Scale subscales or total score. Drug treatment was not related to neurological impairment.The results further support the neurobiological significance of the three clinical syndromes of schizophrenia. Ratings on a scale measuring negative symptoms appear to be less sensitive to neurobiological correlates than is the categorization of the presence or absence of the deficit syndrome.",

      "abstract": "The diagnosis of paralysis of a single ocular muscle on occasion may be difficult, especially if the condition has existed for some time and compensatory changes in other muscles have occurred. When more than one muscle in the same eye is paralytic, a much more difficult task is encountered, and if one or more muscles in each eye are paralyzed, the diagnostic picture can be most confusing and wholly unintelligible. Not only may more than one muscle be paralyzed, but all degrees of paresis of these muscles may be found, together with other complications such as innervational overaction and underaction, spasm, contractures and fibrosis of other muscles not involved primarily. Moreover, the patient may fix in primary or secondary deviation or may vary fixation in different deviations of gaze. It can be safely said that only those who have had the experience are aware of the difficulties that sometimes attend",

Neurologic disease impairs this system at different foci, producing characteristic deficits. Thus, bilateral frontal lobe disease produces a characteristic gait and balance dysfunction along with a mild dementia and incontinence, whereas Parkinson's disease produces a different set of motor abnormalities. Other loci of involvement include spinal cord, peripheral nerve, and muscle. Recently, we observed that lesions within the subcortical white matter (presumably ischemic in origin) may be an important factor in gait and balance dysfunction in older individuals without other defined neurologic disease.

      "abstract": "Clinical characteristics CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy is characterized by nonspecific neurologic findings, mild visual impairment from chorioretinopathy or optic atrophy, male infertility, and characteristic findings on brain MRI. Neurologic findings include mild ataxia (action tremor and gait instability following initially normal motor development; occasionally, mild spasticity), cognitive impairment in some (typically mild, rarely severe), psychiatric symptoms in some (depression and schizophrenia-like symptoms), headaches in some (usually intermittent, severe, and diffuse) and auditory symptoms in some (hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo). Affected individuals remain ambulatory, do not require support for walking, and rarely become blind. To date CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy has been reported or identified in 31 individuals from 30 families. It is not yet known if the findings occurring in a few individuals (i.e., epilepsy and paroxysmal kinesigenic dyskinesia) are part of the phenotypic spectrum or unrelated findings. Diagnosis/testing The diagnosis of CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy is established in a proband by identification of biallelic pathogenic variants in CLCN2 on molecular genetic testing. Management Treatment of manifestations: Supportive care including physical therapy and rehabilitation to improve motor function, special education as needed, treatment of headache, guidance for visual impairment. Surveillance: Annual: neurologic examination. Every 2-3 years: ophthalmologic examination and audiologic assessment. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of older and younger sibs of a proband in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from early diagnosis and routine surveillance for motor, cognitive, vision, and hearing impairment. Genetic counseling CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner. If both parents are known to be heterozygous for a CLCN2 pathogenic variant, each sib of an affected individual has at conception a 25% chance of being affected, a 50% chance of being an asymptomatic carrier, and a 25% chance of being unaffected and not a carrier. Once the CLCN2 pathogenic variants have been identified in an affected family member, carrier testing for at-risk family members and prenatal and preimplantation genetic testing for CLCN2-related leukoencephalopathy are possible.",

      "abstract": "Many symptoms of Parkinson’s disease (PD) are the consequence of motor disability. However, there are clinical features that appear to be independent of motor impairment. For example, depression is a common problem, and patients tend to become passive and show little interest in daily activities. Sleep difficulties are also common in patients with PD, and sleep disruption appears to be related to disease progression. Other symptoms, such as some degree of orthostatic hypotension or constipation, may depend on autonomic dysfunction. Most patients receive treatment with drugs that improve symptoms but also produce side effects; therefore, it is difficult to separate problems associated with the progression of the disease from those caused by medication. For example, when used long term, the most widely used drug therapy, l-dopa, leads to a variety of severe complications, including dyskinesias, “on-off” fluctuations in drug effectiveness, and a number of psychiatric manifestations. Moreover, l-dopa efficacy generally decreases as the disease progresses.\n\nThe ideal new drug would arrest or even reverse the progression of the disease without the complications associated with existing medications. With this aim in mind, it is crucial to assess the potential of the emerging A2A receptor blockers with respect to all features of PD, not just those related to the impairment of the motor system. To achieve this, it is important to understand the …",

      "abstract": "Neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS), while nearly universal in AD, tend to occur in phenotypic clusters, which may reflect distinct pathophysiologies arising from specific underlying brain damage. Therefore, treatments targeting their specific cause(s) are required. For example, symptom clusters (“syndromes”) characterized as affective, psychotic, agitated, apathetic, or reflecting sleep-wake cycle disorders have been proposed. Individual symptoms may co-occur in more than one syndrome at a given time, and these relationships may differ across the MCI to severe AD spectrum. Adding to the complexity, many NPS are thought to be the short-term result of environmental provocations (reactive psychological states and behaviors) which partly arise from non-specific effects of brain damage. For example, striking out during caregiving, acute nocturnal confusion, and excessively loud vocalization when confronted by cognitive limitations might be understood as the result of unsophisticated caregiving, acute delirium, or catastrophic reaction. The above issues have hampered the NPS field's ability to agree on how to evaluate, differentiate, and treat NPS. Gaining consensus on a common algorithmic approach to evaluation, differentiation, and how and when to initiate non-pharmacologic psychosocial treatments, would lay solid foundation for tackling NPS in the clinical world, and inform research in developing new therapies. We present an Expert Consensus Panel's proposed unified algorithm for the assessment, differentiation, and treatment of NPS in AD. Three talks are envisioned, followed by a panel discussion. The first talk uses epidemiologic findings from several international studies to define the challenge posed by NPS overlap, varying etiologies, and differences by AD stage, and lays the conceptual background for the proposed algorithm. The second talk expands the Four “D's” systematic approach to evaluation and differentiation (Rabins, Lyketsos, and Steele, 1999) that allows clinicians and researchers to develop patient specific interventions. The final talk presents evidence supporting the use of psychosocial interventions for NPS linked to the outcomes of the “4D” method, and discusses both specific and non-specific psychosocial approaches to the management of individual NPS syndromes. The latter assumes that such well articulated psychosocial approaches must be used prior to medication treatments. The panel concludes with speaker and audience discussion moderated by the panel chair.",

Although depression is a known primary mediator of health-related quality of life, it is currently unknown whether the timing of depression diagnosis relative to PD diagnosis affects receipt of depression treatment. Electronic health record data were examined to explore differences in depression treatment among patients diagnosed with depression before or after PD diagnosis. Compared to PD patients diagnosed with depression prior to PD, those diagnosed with depression following PD are less likely to receive any treatment, either pharmacologic or non-pharmacologic, indicating a temporal association between the time of PD diagnosis and receipt of depression treatment. This highlights a potentially substantial treatment gap, despite the existence of efficacious treatment. Diagnosis with PD appears to alter depression treatment and further research is warranted to determine potential causes and effective interventions.",

Psychological factors are decisive, and they usually include a major anxiety generated by intrapsychic conflicts, which are converted by unconscious defense mechanism into symptoms. The symptoms are not intentionally provoked or simulated nor are explained by organic suffering or substance consumption. They affect the quality of life of the person who presents significant deficits such as motor, sensory, convulsive or mixed. It may also occur a lack of coordination, ataxia, paralysis, tremor, aphonia, difficulties at swallowing, loss of sensitivity, anesthesia that does not follow anatomical nervous trajectories, blindness or mental deafness. Consciousness is not altered, but a condition of \"la belle indifference\" appears which is rather associated with histrionic personality disorders and what the patients imagine about their own illness or suffering. This condition is unstable and changing. The primary gain is the expression of an unconscious psychological conflict through a somatic symptom by reducing anxiety and keeping conflict out of consciousness. The secondary gain is external and includes attention and care from caregivers or others.",

Here we summarize some of the latest literature on autonomic dysfunction, focusing primarily on the perioperative implications.The variety of autonomic dysfunction now extends to a large number of clinical conditions in which the cause or effect of the autonomic component is blurred. Methods for detecting dysautonomia can be as simple as performing a history and physical examination that includes orthostatic vital signs measured in both recumbent and vertical positions; however, specialized laboratories are required for definitive diagnosis. Heart rate variability monitoring is becoming more commonplace in the assessment and understanding of autonomic instability. Degenerative diseases of the autonomic nervous system include Parkinson's disease and multiple system atrophy, with the most serious manifestations being postural hypotension and paradoxical supine hypertension. Other conditions occur in which the autonomic dysfunction is only part of a larger disease process, such as diabetic autonomic neuropathy, traumatic brain injury, and spinal cord injury.Patients with dysautonomia often have unpredictable and paradoxical physiological responses to various perioperative stimuli. Knowledge of the underlying pathophysiology of their condition is required in order to reduce symptom exacerbation and limit morbidity and mortality during the perioperative period.",

However, recent evidence suggests that this impairment is not generalized: visuo-spatial working memory and attentional set-shifting seem to be selectively impaired in the early stages of the disease. Electrophysiological studies also demonstrate the dysfunction of higher-level visual information processing. In this article, we discuss some current results to show the connection between clinical symptoms and neuropsychological deficits. We also consider dysfunction in underlying neural mechanisms, with particular emphasis on the dysregulation of fronto-striatal circuits. However, it is conceivable that visuo-cognitive impairment in PD reflects dysfunction of neural assemblies, involving basal ganglia, dorsal visual stream, and frontal-prefrontal circuits.",

Motorische Auffalligkeiten wie Parkinsonismus oder neurologische Soft Signs sind beispielweise mit schlechterer Ausfuhrung von Handgesten, aber auch mit schlechterer Wahrnehmung nonverbaler sozialer Stimuli assoziiert. Storungen der Handgestik als Einschrankungen in der nonverbalen Kommunikation sagen wiederum niedrigeres soziales Funktionsniveau und mehr Negativsymptomatik im Verlauf von 6 Monaten vorher.

Its prevalence and effects on quality of life in patients with monogenic forms of PD have not been systematically explored. Methods: Comprehensive literature review exploring the association between monogenic forms of PD ( SNCA , PRKN , PINK1 , DJ1 , and LRRK2 ) and pain. We included pain in ATP13A2, VPS35 , and GBA1 mutation carriers. After initial screening, sixty-five relevant articles were identified. Studies’ design, sample sizes, and pain outcome measures were highly heterogeneous. Results: Our review suggests that patients with some PD monogenic causes show a higher prevalence of specific pain subtypes. While painful foot dystonia is more frequently reported in SNCA and PRKN carriers, the last ones also describe frequent lower back pain mostly. Pain in general is most commonly reported in PINK1 mutation carriers followed by patients with LRRK2 mutations. Pain as an initial symptom and severe symptom is well described in GBA1 -PD patients. There is limited and insufficient evidence to report on pain and ATP13A2 , DJ1 , and VPS35 mutations.

      "title": "Borderline Personality Disorder Is a Heritable Brain Disease",
      "abstract": "The prevailing view among many psychiatrists and mental health professionals is that borderline personality disorder (BPD) is a psychological condition. BPD often is conceptualized as a behavioral consequence of childhood trauma; treatment approaches have emphasized intensive psychotherapeutic modalities, less so biologic interventions. You might not be aware that a large body of research over the past decade provides strong evidence that BPD is a neurobiological illness--a finding that would drastically alter how the disorder should be conceptualized and managed. Neuropathology underpins the personality disorder Foremost, BPD must be regarded as a serious, disabling brain disorder, not simply an aberration of personality In DSM-5, symptoms of BPD are listed as: feelings of abandonment; unstable and intense interpersonal relationships; unstable sense of self; impulsivity; suicidal or self-mutilating behavior; affective instability (dysphoria, irritability anxiety); chronic feelings of emptiness; intense anger episodes; and transient paranoid or dissociative symptoms. Clearly, these dusters of psychopathological and behavioral symptoms reflect a pervasive brain disorder associated with abnormal neurobiology and neural circuitry that might, at times, stubbornly defy therapeutic intervention. No wonder that 42 published studies report that, compared with healthy controls, people who have BPD display extensive cortical and subcortical abnormalities in brain structure and function.1 These anomalous patterns have been detected across all 4 available neuroimaging techniques. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] Magnetic resonance imaging. MRI studies have revealed the following abnormalities in BPD: * hypoplasia of the hippocampus, caudate, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex * variations in the CA1 region of the hippocampus and subiculum * smaller-than-normal orbitofrontal cortex (by 24%, compared with healthy controls) and the mid-temporal and left cingulate gyrii (by 26%) * larger-than-normal volume of the right inferior parietal cortex and the right parahippocampal gyrus * loss of gray matter in the frontal, temporal, and parietal cortices * an enlarged third cerebral ventricle * in women, reduced size of the medial temporal lobe and amygdala * in men, a decreased concentration of gray matter in the anterior cingulate * reversal of normal right-greater-than-left asymmetry of the orbitofrontal cortex gray matter, reflecting loss of gray matter on the right side * a lower concentration of gray matter in the rostral/subgenual anterior cingulate cortex * a smaller frontal lobe. In an analysis of MRI studies,2 correlation was found between structural brain abnormalities and specific symptoms of BPD, such as impulsivity suicidality, and aggression. These findings might someday guide personalized in-terventions--for example, using neuro-stimulation techniques such as repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and deep brain stimulation--to modulate the activity of a given region of the brain (depending on which symptom is most prominent or disabling). Magnetic resonance spectroscopy. In BPD, MRS studies reveal: * compared with controls, a higher glutamate level in the anterior cingulate cortex * reduced levels of N-acetyl aspartate (NAA; found in neurons) and creatinine in the left amygdala * a reduction (on average, 19%) in the NAA concentration in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Functional magnetic resonance imaging. From fMRI studies, there is evidence in BPD of: * greater activation of the amygdala and prolonged return to baseline * increased functional connectivity in the left frontopolar cortex and left insula * decreased connectivity in the left cuneus and left inferior parietal and the right middle temporal lobes * marked frontal hypometabolism * hypermetabolism in the motor cortex, medial and anterior cingulate, and occipital and temporal poles * lower connectivity between the amygdala during a neutral stimulus * higher connectivity between the amygdala during fear stimulus * deactivation of the opioid system in the left nucleus accumbens, hypothalamus, and hippocampus * hyperactivation of the left medial prefrontal cortex during social exclusion * more mistakes made in differentiating an emotional and a neutral facial expression. …",

      "abstract": "The pathological system (PS) is a new pathological integration originating from the primary and secondary altered CNS structure, whose activity has a dysadaptive or direct pathogenic significance for the body. An important role in the formation of PS is played by hyperactive CNS structure which acquires the role of a pathological determinant. Disturbances in the inhibitory mechanisms of CNS structures involved in the PS and enhanced excitability of their neurons promote the formation of PS. Negative feedbacks in PS are ineffective due to the competence of inhibitory mechanisms in the determinant and other parts of the system. Owing to their permanent activation, positive intrasystemic feedbacks are stabilized by plasticity processes. All these changes promote the stabilization of PS and the increase of its resistance to endogenous corrective influences. The major pathogenetic significance of PS is that it is a pathophysiological basis of the respective syndrome. Every neuropathological syndrome has PS of its own. By creating a generator in the definite, pathogenetically significant structure of CNS, one can convert this structure into the pathological determinant, which induces the appropriate PS and thus causes the respective neuropathological syndrome. Hyperactive PSs suppress the physiological systems by causing disturbances in CNS activity.",

Dentro de los sintomas no motores, los conductuales, son muy frecuentes y producen un gran impacto en la calidad de vida de los pacientes y familiares. Dentro de estos ultimos la apatia es de reciente consideracion y debido a la incapacidad e interferencia en la vida del paciente ultimamente, son muchos los estudios realizados al respecto. La apatia se define como una reducc ion cuantitativa de los actos del paciente comparados con comportamientos previos, a pesar de que el ambiente del paciente y su situacion fisica permanezcan sin cambios. Actualmente se aceptan tres subtipos de apatia (emocional, cognitiva y por defic it en la autoactivacion) con una base fisiopatologica bien diferenciada. La prevalencia de apatia en la Enfermedad de Parkinson esta entre 30-50 segun los estudios y metodos de medida. El diagnostico de apatia requiere un diagnostico diferencial de la depresion y el deterioro cognitivo pues aparecen con frecuencia tambien el los pacientes con Enfermedad de Parkinson. La escala LARS es la primera escala desarrollada para valorar la apatia en la Enfermedad de Parkinson y esta basada en los nuevo s conceptos fisiopatologicos de este sindrome. OBJETIVOS: Obtener datos de validacion de la escala LARS en una poblacion espanola de pacientes con Enfermedad de Parkinson. Estudiar la influencia de la depresion y el deterioro cognitivo en la puntuaci on final de LARS. MATERIAL Y METODOS:Se han estudiado una muestra de 130 pacientes y 70 controles. Se han recogido los datos demograficos. Se ha aplicado a toda la muestra de pacientes la escala LARS y una bateria neuropsicologica que incluia otra escala de apatia y test de diagnostico de depresion y deterioro cognitivo. En primer lugar se ha realizado una traduccion de la escala consensuada por traductores y expertos en la materia. Posteriormente, se ha realizado un estudio piloto en 30 paci entes para comprobar la interpretabilidad de la escala en los pacientes y obtener los primeros datos de fiabilidad. Por ultimo se han realizado las pruebas estadisticas de fiabilidad y validez interna y externa de la escala. Ademas hemos realizado u n analisis multivariante de la relacion de la puntuacion total de LARS con variables del estudio asi como con las variables que miden depresion y deterioro cognitivo.

Pain generally accompanies the visual loss in cases of inflammatory optic neuritis. Compressive or infiltrative lesions that affect the optic nerve, such as optic glioma or optic nerve sheath meningioma, may present with painless unilateral visual loss. Neoplastic and non-neoplastic causes of compression of the intracranial optic nerve and optic chiasm frequently present with visual field defects. Slowly progressive, symmetric, central visual loss suggests a possible toxic or nutritional cause. Hereditary optic neuropathies generally are classified by their mode of inheritance: autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or mitochondrial (maternal) inheritance. Symptoms may be confined to the visual system or be accompanied by other neurologic or systemic signs and symptoms. Optic neuropathy can also be a manifestation of inherited metabolic and degenerative diseases.",

We will start by orientating ourselves toward cerebral palsy, and in the discussion taking up the question of differential diagnosis and related subjects. Cerebral palsy is not a single but a group of conditions which have in common a disorder of the motor system. It can be paralysis, incoordination, tremors or excessive motions, due to involvement of the motor centers of the brain. In other words, palsy and cerebral are defined. The important thing about cerebral is that the motor centers must be involved. If the problem is lack of development because of mental deficiency, you can exclude it. Likewise, spinal palsy, polio, and other causes of motor defects not due to involvement of the motor center are excluded. In schools for children with physical handicaps of all types, about half the children are cerebral palsied. So, from the viewpoint of frequency, cerebral palsy is the most frequent of the disabling conditions. Much confusion exists in the terminology and classification of cerebral palsy. The term Little9s disease has often been used as a generic term to cover all forms of cerebral palsy. Actually, Little described only one of the many types. Likewise, the term spastic is often used by the doctor and laymen to cover all categories. This tendency is conducive to loose thinking. A logical classification of the types of cerebral palsy would help to clarify this confused subject.",

      "title": "Association Between Poor Cognitive Functioning and Risk of Incident Parkinsonism",
      "abstract": "Cognitive dysfunction is a common feature among patients with parkinsonism, including Parkinson disease (PD). However, there is a scarcity of data on cognitive functioning before parkinsonism diagnosis, a stage at which patients may still respond to putative disease-modifying interventions.To assess whether poor cognitive functioning is associated with an increased risk of parkinsonism.Between January 8, 2002, and December 14, 2008, baseline cognitive function was assessed in 7386 participants of the Rotterdam Study who were free of parkinsonism and dementia. Four tests were administered (Stroop color word test, letter-digit substitution, verbal fluency, and word learning) and a global cognition score was derived from principal component analysis. Subsequently, participants were followed up until January 1, 2015, for the onset of parkinsonism through serial in-person examinations and complete access to medical records. Parkinsonism was defined as the (1) presence of hypokinesia or bradykinesia plus at least 1 other cardinal sign and/or (2) clinical diagnosis by a neurologist or geriatrician. Patients with dementia diagnosis before parkinsonism diagnosis were considered to have probable PD.Hazard ratios (HRs) for incident parkinsonism per SD decrease in global cognition, adjusted for age, sex, and study subcohort.A total of 7386 patients were included in the analysis; of these, 4236 (57.4%) were women and mean (SD) age was 65.3 (10.2) years. During follow-up (median, 8.3 years; range, 0-15 years), 79 (1.1%) individuals received a diagnosis of incident parkinsonism; of these, 57 (72.2%) received a diagnosis of probable PD. Among patients with incident parkinsonism, 24 (30.4%) also developed dementia (10 before and 14 after parkinsonism onset). Poor global cognition at baseline was associated with a higher hazard of incident parkinsonism (hazard ratio [HR], 1.79; 95% CI, 1.37-2.33). The association remained robust beyond the first 8 years (HR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.01-2.59) and after removing individuals with dementia onset before parkinsonism (HR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.28-2.27). Poor global cognition at baseline was also associated with incident probable PD (HR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.11-2.08). Letter-digit substitution (HR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.22-2.04), verbal fluency (HR, 1.61; 95% CI, 1.23-2.08), and inverted interference task Stroop color word test (HR, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.25-1.96) scores were each associated with incident parkinsonism, whereas the association with word learning delayed-task scores was weaker (HR, 1.18; 95% CI, 0.92-1.52).Poor cognitive functioning is associated with an increased risk of incident parkinsonism, including probable PD. Cognition indicates the probability of parkinsonism over long intervals and extends beyond patients with onset of parkinsonism after dementia. The findings suggest that cognitive dysfunction can be considered a sign of prodromal PD.",

Сепсис-асоційована енцефалопатія — мультифокальне порушення функцій головного мозку за умови наявності інфекції, що супроводжується проявами системного запалення, але без клінічних і лабораторних доказів прямої причетності інфекції до пошкодження головного мозку. Залежно від критеріїв, покладених в основу діагностики, церебральна дисфункція-недостатність може бути виявлена в усіх хворих із сепсисом. Ступінь її вираженості корелює зі зростанням тяжкості септичного процесу. Сепсис-асоційована дисфункція-недостатність може бути незалежним предиктором летального кінця. Тяжкість церебральної дисфункції-недостатності коливається від летаргії і/або дезорієнтації до коми. Мета: вивчення впливу терапії відповідно до головних положень «Міжнародного керівництва з інтенсивної терапії сепсису та септичного шоку: 2016» із додатковою нейропротекцією Гліатиліном на перебіг септичного процесу й вираженість енцефалопатії в структурі синдрому поліорганної недостатності. Матеріали та методи. За період 2010–2015 рр. нами проведено контрольоване проспективне рандомізоване когортне дослідження на клінічній базі кафедри анестезіології та інтенсивної терапії ДЗ «Дніпропетровська медична академія МОЗ України» і на базі відділення інтенсивної терапії сепсису КП «Дніпропетровська обласна клінічна лікарня ім. І.І. Мечникова» ДОР». У дослідження було включено 22 пацієнти. У всіх хворих було проведено рутинні лабораторні дослідження для визначення рівня клінічних і біохімічних маркерів системного запалення й органних дисфункцій за шкалами SOFA і LIFE. Для оцінки стану свідомості використовували шкалу коми Глазго. Концентрацію цитокінів (фактор некрозу пухлини α, інтерлейкін-1, інтерлейкін-4, інтерферон α) у сироватці крові вивчали імуноферментним методом. Базисна інтенсивна терапія здійснювалася відповідно до основних положень «Міжнародного керівництва з інтенсивної терапії сепсису та септичного шоку: 2016» з додатковим використанням нейропротекторного препарату Гліатиліну (холіну альфосцерат) 1000–3000 мг на добу внутрішньовенно, розчиненого в 0,9% розчині натрію хлориду, протягом 5–10 днів. Дослідження показників проводилося в чотири етапи: на 1-шу, 3-тю, 5-ту, 7-му добу. Результати. Узагальнюючи результати дослідження, можливо сказати, що на п’яту й сьому добу були відсутні клінічні прояви синдрому системної запальної відповіді в понад 75 % хворих; зменшилася тяжкість стану за APACHE II на 72,5 і 74,5 % (p &lt; 0,001) і ступінь вираженості синдрому поліорганної недостатності за SOFA в 9 разів (p &lt; 0,001) відповідно до етапів дослідження. Церебральна недостатність, оцінена за шкалою коми Глазго, становила 15 балів на п’яту й сьому добу дослідження, що відповідало стану ясної свідомості в понад 75 % хворих. Зазначене спостерігалося на тлі тенденції до збалансованості активності прозапальних і протизапальних ланок цитокінової системи, про що свідчили максимальні значення фактора некрозу пухлини α та інтерферону α на п’яту добу спостереження при зниженні концентрації інтерлейкіну-1 на 55,8 % щодо фону. Прогнозована летальність у пацієнтів другої групи становила 51 %, фактична летальність — 7,5 %. Отже, шляхом проведення даного варіанта інтенсивної терапії вдалося знизити передбачувану летальність на 43,5 %.",

Within a short time following his treatise, it became all too clear to those in the field that Parkinson's disease is more than just a motor disorder, and as was aptly conceptualized by Paul McHugh, Professor of Psychiatry at Johns Hopkins Hospital from 1975 until 2001, Parkinson's disease is closer to being a “triadic disorder,” encompassing motor, cognitive, and psychiatric elements (McHugh, 1989). Even this notion is now outdated, with the triad being accompanied by autonomic, pain, and other non-motor syndromes.",

These should be investigated first. But if the degree or rate of decline raises suspicion for cognitive deterioration, it is prudent to consider the possibility that a neurologic condition may be presenting insidiously. Particularly if the symptoms seem progressive or there is involvement of other organ systems, further evaluation is warranted. Visual abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, and liver involvement are among the symptoms commonly associated with some neurodegenerative disorders. Clinical course is important to consider, as a relapsing course will be more suggestive of an inflammatory/autoimmune etiology. A progressive course is more concerning for metabolic disorders, including leukodystrophies.",

      "abstract": "In dealing with a disorder that has been discussed from so many and such diverse points of view as has dementia praecox it is expedient that one define somewhat explicitly the conceptions upon which his experimental attack and his interpretations are based. It is our belief that dementia praecox is a reaction trend and is an entity only and to a lesser degree in the sense that headache or fever is an entity. It is a disorder of multiple causation. Among the demonstrated \"causes\" of the psychosis are trauma, puerperal sepsis, typhoid fever and unresolved psychic conflicts. We share with Janet the belief that fundamental to the disorder in each case is a lack of nervous energy leading to a feeling of inadequacy and a consequent flight from reality. It can develop in a relatively strong man as a result of overwhelming difficulties or in a weak man from relatively trivial difficulties. To list the eminent psychiatrists who are in accord or disagreement with these conceptions, though conventional, would be supererogatory. From these premises it follows that the numerous searches that have been made for the cause of dementia praecox were foredoomed to failure, and for precisely the same reason as would be a search for the cause of headache or sterility. The perennial debate whether the disorder is of organic or psychogenic origin is to our minds quite on a par with a discussion whether tuberculosis is due to the presence of tubercle bacilli or susceptibility of the patient. It disregards the nature of causality.",

      "abstract": "Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a syndrome that spans the area between normal ageing and dementia. It is classified into amnestic and non-amnestic types, both with two subtypes: single domain and multiple domains. Prevalence of MCI depends on criteria and population and can vary from 0.1 to 42% persons of older age. In contrast to dementia, cognitive deterioration is less severe and activities of daily living are preserved. Most impaired higher cognitive functions in MCI are memory, executive functions, language, visuospatial functions, attention etc. Also there are depression, apathy or psychomotor agitation, and signs of psychosis. Aetiology of MCI is multiple, mostly neurodegenerative, vascular, psychiatric, internistic, neurological, traumatic and iatrogenic. Persons with amnestic MCI are at a higher risk of converting to Alzheimer's disease, while those with a single non-memory domain are at risk of developing frontotemporal dementia. Some MCI patients also progress to other dementia types, vascular among others. In contrast, some patients have a stationary course, some improve, while others even normalize. Every suspicion of MCI warrants a detailed clinical exploration to discover underlying aetiology, laboratory analyses, neuroimaging methods and some cases require a detailed neuropsychological assessment. At the present time there is no efficacious therapy for cognitive decline in MCI or the one that could postpone conversion to dementia. The treatment of curable causes, application of preventive measures and risk factor control are reasonable measures in the absence of specific therapy.",

La segunda es que la mayoria de ellos corresponde a una fase inicial de la EA, sin demencia. Nuestros comentarios son dos. El primero es que no se necesitaria tener una demencia para sospechar o diagnosticar una EA probable.

      "abstract": "Cognitive impairment is a common feature in Parkinson's disease (PD) and other α-synucleinopathies as 80% of PD patients develop dementia within 20 years. Early cognitive changes in PD patients present as a dysexecutive syndrome, broadly characterized as a disruption of the fronto-striatal dopamine network. Cognitive deficits in other domains (recognition memory, attention processes and visuospatial abilities) become apparent with the progression of PD and development of dementia. In dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) the cognitive impairment develops early or even precedes parkinsonism and it is more pronounced in visuospatial skills and memory. Cognitive impairment in the rarer α-synucleinopathies (multiple system atrophy and pure autonomic failure) is less well studied. Metabolic brain imaging with positron emission tomography and [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG-PET) is a well-established diagnostic method in neurodegenerative diseases, including dementias. Changes in glucose metabolism precede those seen on structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Reduction in glucose metabolism and atrophy have been suggested to represent consecutive changes of neurodegeneration and are linked to specific cognitive disorders (e.g., dysexecutive syndrome, memory impairment, visuospatial deficits etc.). Advances in the statistical analysis of FDG-PET images enabling a network analysis broadened our understanding of neurodegenerative brain processes. A specific cognitive pattern related to PD was identified by applying voxel-based network modeling approach. The magnitude of this pattern correlated significantly with patients' cognitive skills. Specific metabolic brain changes were observed also in patients with DLB as well as in a prodromal phase of α-synucleinopathy: REM sleep behavior disorder. Metabolic brain imaging with FDG-PET is a reliable biomarker of neurodegenerative brain diseases throughout their course, precisely reflecting their topographic distribution, stage and functional impact.",

      "abstract": "Cognitive impairment and dementia are the most frequently occurring nonmotor symptoms in Parkinson’s disease (PD), yet these symptoms are mostly overlooked and are not diagnosed and treated exceptionally like the cardinal motor symptoms in clinical practice. It is only in the late twentieth century that dementia has been recognized as a major clinical manifestation in PD. The possible mechanisms that cause dementia are complex with different patterns of cognitive behavior that disrupt the patient’s quality of life. It is preeminently considered that the cholinergic denervation in the basal forebrain region mediates dementia in PD. So far, dopamine-based therapy is the key objective in the treatment of PD and the nonmotor symptoms are mostly neglected. Interestingly, the loss of Tyrosine kinase receptor-A (TrkA) signaling in basal forebrain results in neuronal atrophy, which precedes cholinergic denervation and cognitive impairment. Nerve Growth Factor (NGF) binds to TrkA receptors, inducing a cascade of events like PI-3Kinase/Akt and MAPK signaling pathways that render cholinergic degeneration and upregulate the choline acetyltransferase activity and neuronal differentiation. Hence, TrkA receptor activation by small molecules might attenuate the dementia symptoms associated with PD, and may be targeted as a novel treatment strategy along with regular clinical agents.",

      "title": "The Influence of Depression in the Evolution of Parkinson’s Disease: A Psychiatric Perspective",
      "abstract": "Introduction Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative condition that is predominantly characterised by its motor symptoms. Nevertheless, it is important to note that non-motor symptoms, particularly depression often occur concurrently, exerting a substantial influence on the progression of the disease and the overall well-being of individuals affected by it. Objectives The objective of this study is to examine the influence of depression on the advancement of Parkinson’s disease (PD) from a psychiatric perspective. This analysis will involve an assessment of the common neurobiological pathways involved and the potential implications for clinical treatment and care. Methods A comprehensive assessment of the literature was conducted, focusing on clinical observations, neurochemical interactions, and neuroimaging investigations that provide insight into the concurrent presence of depression and Parkinson’s disease (PD). This study aimed to investigate the potential impact of depression on the severity of Parkinson’s disease symptoms, the course of the disease, and the responsiveness to treatment. Results Depression in Parkinson’s disease (PD) is not only a reactive occurrence, but rather it may be attributed to common pathophysiological mechanisms, such as changes in dopamine and serotonin pathways. The coexistence of depression among individuals with Parkinson’s disease (PD) has been linked to heightened severity of motor and cognitive symptoms, accelerated development of the disease, and diminished effectiveness of therapy interventions. Furthermore, the presence of depression in individuals with Parkinson’s disease intensifies the psychosocial difficulties experienced by both patients and their carers. Conclusions The recognition and management of depression in individuals with Parkinson’s disease (PD) is of utmost importance in order to enhance treatment approaches and enhance the overall well-being of patients. The establishment of interdisciplinary collaboration between neurologists and psychiatrists is necessary in order to guarantee a holistic approach to patient care.

Les patients atteints de la MP souffrant de RBD ont tendance a presenter des symptomes moteurs et non moteurs plus graves que les patients ne souffrant pas de RBD, ce qui suggere que le RBD est un marqueur d'un processus neurodegeneratif plus repandu.

Pourtant, aucune etude n'a evalue si les patients atteints de MP et de troubles respiratoires chroniques presentent une frequence accrue de symptomes neuropsychiatriques, en particulier des troubles du controle des impulsions et de l'apathie.

Materiel et methodes : n=216 patients PD non dements consecutifs consultant une clinique universitaire de troubles du mouvement a Turin et Clermont-Ferrand (130 M, âge moyen : 66,9±10,8 ans) ont rempli des questionnaires pour le RBD et les CIM. En outre, 40 patients atteints de MP ayant recu un diagnostic clinique de maladie inflammatoire chronique et 40 patients atteints de MP sans maladie inflammatoire chronique, apparies par sexe et âge, ont subi une videopolysomnographie (v-PSG) afin de determiner la frequence de la DBR. L'apathie a ete evaluee chez 36 patients ayant subi une v-PSG (n=18 patients atteints de MP avec DCI, n=18 patients atteints de la MP), et sa relation avec la depression, avec un large eventail de fonctions neuropsychologiques ainsi qu'avec des symptomes moteurs et non moteurs a ete evaluee. Resultats : la DBR probable a ete associee a un risque de 2,6 de developper des symptomes de CIM dans l'ensemble (p=0,001) et a un risque de 4,9 pour le jeu pathologique (p= 0,049). La RBD confirmee par le VPSG a ete trouvee chez 34/40 (85%) des patients atteints de PD-ICD contre 21/40 (53%) des patients atteints de PD-noICD (p=0,003). L'association etait significative apres ajustement de la duree de la maladie, de l'âge d'apparition, de la gravite et de la dose de traitement (p=0,01) et l'etat de la CIM est associe a un rapport impair de 5,44 pour avoir une DBR. L'apathie etait plus elevee chez les patients atteints de DBR que chez les patients atteints de la MP sans DBR. Apres 11 ajustements en fonction de l'âge, de la duree de la DP, des doses de DRT, des mesures cognitives et de la depression, nous avons constate que les PD-RBD presentent un manque d'initiative (p=0,03) ainsi qu'une tendance a la reduction des interets et a la recherche de nouveaute. L'ampleur de l'effet etait importante (>0,8) ou presque (>0,75) pour ces variables. De plus, l'apathie etait significativement correlee a la mesure du sommeil paradoxal sans atonie. Conclusions : Nous avons montre pour la premiere fois que le RBD est associe a des DCI dans le DP. De plus, les patients RBD sans DAI sont plus apathiques que les patients sans RBD. Un traitement dysfonctionnel de la recompense dans le DP-RBD, resultant peut-etre d'une alteration plus grave de la voie meso-cortico-limbique, peut contribuer a la fois a une apathie accrue et a une frequence accrue des DAI lorsqu'ils sont traites avec des doses plus elevees de DRT.",

Od velike je važnosti osvijestenje i razumijevanje ove izazovne bolesti kako bi se omogucila kvalitetna pomoc oboljelima u svakodnevnom sukobljavanju s onesposobljenjima koje ova bolest donosi. \nParkinsonova bolest je neizljeciva, neurodegenerativna, progresivna i idiopatska bolest koja postepeno uzrokuje motoricke poremecaje te rezultira onesposobljenjem. Nazvana je po engleskom lijecniku Jamesu Parkinsonu koji ju je po prvi puta opisao 1817. godine u svom djelu An essay on the shaking palsy i prvotno je nazvao drhtajucom paralizom zbog njenih onesposobljavajucih simptoma. Karakteristicnim se simptomima manifestira kao posljedica izrazitog nedostatka neurotransmitera dopamina u dijelu mozga odgovornom za kontrolu voljno koordiniranih pokreta i pocetka neke motoricke radnje. Kao posljedica kemijskog deficita u dijelu mozga koji nadzire voljne pokrete javljaju se nevoljni pokreti. Ocituje se bradikinezijom, rigorom, tremorom u mirovanju te manjkom posturalnog refleksa. Simptomi ukljucuju sporost u izvođenju pokreta, gubitak ritma i spontane motorike, povecanje tonusa misica i tremor određenih dijelova tijela. Obicno je bolesnik tijekom hoda nagnut prema naprijed, bez spontanih kretnji ruku, tesko zapocinje neku radnju, mimika lica je osiromasena, a glas tih (hipofonija) i govor katkad nerazumljiv.\nFizioterapija se kod Parkinsonove bolesti primjenjuje kako bi oboljelima i njihovim obiteljima omogucila edukaciju i vjestine za optimalnu neovisnost, smanjenje onesposobljenosti te sigurnost u svakodnevnim aktivnostima. Vježbama i fizickom aktivnoscu unaprjeđuje se snaga, balans, pokretljivost i kvaliteta života. Terapija ukljucuje redovno vježbanje kao na primjer vježbe snage i fleksibilnosti te strategije pokreta sto znatno utjece na mobilnost i na poboljsanje obrasca hoda. U svrhu smanjenja rizika od padova korisna je hidroterapija. Također se koriste vježbe balansa s loptom i trening hoda s glazbom.

      "title": "Diagnosis and Treatment of Depression in Parkinson’s Disease",
      "abstract": "Depression and anxiety are the most common and frequently disabling psychiatric conditions that accompany Parkinson’s disease (PD). Although James Parkinson, in his original report of six patients, wrote that the “senses and intellect being uninjured” (1), he still used descriptions like “melancholy” and “unhappy sufferer.” In early 1920s, some authors argued that “abnormal psychic functioning” was a part of the disease process and that “the mental set was always depressive” (2). Nowadays, it is widely accepted that, despite discrepancies in patient selection, inconsistent definitions of depression, and different methods of assessment, a considerable risk of depression appears to accompany PD. Depressive symptoms in parkinsonian patients have been classified as “organic mood syndrome” in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, third edition, revised (DSM-IIIR) and as “mood disorder due to a general medical condition” in DSM-IV. Although the exact etiology of depression in PD is unclear, available evidence suggests that biochemical changes, psychosocial factors, and situational stressors may all contribute to its development (3). Finally, although major depression (MD) may occur in PD, studies indicate that the majority of depressed parkinsonians have less severe forms such as minor depression, dysthymic disorder, and subsyndromal forms (4–6).",

While neuropsychiatric symptoms and early cognitive decline are also common in this entity there is little information regarding other non-motor symptoms (NMS). Here, we describe a 26-year-old patient with PLAN-DP whose motor symptoms were preceded by mild cognitive impairment and anxiety, and who developed many other NMS as the disease evolved. Furthermore, we reviewed the NMS described in all the PLAN-DP patients published to date. A total of 50 patients with PLAN-DP were identified, 42 of whom developed NMS and in 23 of these cases, NMS preceded the motor symptoms of the disease. Neuropsychiatric symptoms dominated the premotor phase of this condition and cognitive impairment/dementia was the most prevalent NMS. Other NMS were reported infrequently like sleep disorders, autonomic symptoms, pain and hyposmia, and mostly as the disease evolved. NMS are very frequent in PLAN-DP and they may appear before diagnosis or during the course of the disease. Neuropsychiatric symptoms and cognitive decline are the most frequent NMS. The appearance of neuropsychiatric symptoms like depression, anxiety or personality changes prior to a diagnosis of parkinsonism in younger individuals might suggest the presence of PLA2G6 gene mutations.",

      "title": "Emergency presentations of Parkinson's disease: early recognition and treatment are crucial for optimum outcome",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Parkinson's disease (PD) is a debilitating condition associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Pathophysiologically the illness is due to a disruption of dopamine production in the basal ganglia and leads to a wide array of symptoms. These symptoms are not restricted to the nervous system; thus, the illness often presents acutely to a wide range of specialties, many of which may have limited experience in the condition. Patients often become unwell with illnesses unrelated to their PD. However, these conditions frequently lead to a deterioration in PD control. In addition, there exist certain acute complications of PD which are often difficult to recognise and carry significant mortality. Discussing the acute presentations of the illness under the umbrella of PD is important as it enables clinicians to focus upon the specific concerns involved in managing patients with the illness. A number of conditions are extremely common in PD and include falls, orthostatic hypotension, swallowing difficulties, psychosis, and hyperkinetic movement disorders. Optimal treatment of these conditions requires the consideration of issues specific to PD. Lesser recognised acute presentations of PD include the serotonin syndrome and neuroleptic malignant-like syndrome. While encountered less commonly, these conditions have been well described in the literature and untreated may prove fatal. They require urgent management, with their importance being further highlighted by the fact they may often mimic other illnesses, making diagnosis difficult. Therapeutic interventions aimed at treating PD and preventing its complications are evolving rapidly.",

      "abstract": "The definition of dual tryptophan pathways has increased the understanding of the mind-body, body-mind dichotomy. The serotonergic pathway highlights the primary (endogenous) psychiatric disorders. The up-regulation of the kynurenine pathway by physical illnesses can cause neuropathic and immunological disorders1 associated with secondary neuropsychiatric symptoms. Tryptophan and nicotinamide deficiencies fall within the protein energy malnutrition (PEM) spectrum. They can arise if the kynurenine pathway is stressed by primary or secondary inflammatory conditions and the consequent imbalance of available catabolic/anabolic substrates may adversely influence convalescent phase efficiency. The replacement of depleted or reduced NAD+ levels and other cofactors can perhaps improve the clinical management of these disorders. Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and fibromyalgia (FM) appear to meet the criteria of a tryptophan-kynurenine pathway disorder with potential neuroimmunological sequelae. Aspects of some of the putative precipitating factors have been previously outlined.2,3 An analysis of the areas of metabolic dysfunction will focus on future directions for research and management.",

Sintomas depressivos, associados ou não a alterações motoras, cada vez mais prevalentes nos idosos, devem também ser avaliados como DP. Objetivo Analisar os estudos que tratem sobre a relação entre a DP e o transtorno depressivo. Metodologia Revisão de literatura realizada entre fevereiro e maio de 2021 por meio de pesquisas de artigos e publicações científicas dos últimos 20 anos, na Biblioteca Virtual em Saúde (BVS), sobre a relação da DP e os transtornos depressivos. Após busca e seleção do material, finalizou-se com a leitura na íntegra de 18 artigos. Resultados A DP é diagnosticada mais frequentemente em indivíduos com mais de 50 anos de idade, de ambos os sexos, com incidência e prevalência diretamente proporcionais ao aumento da idade. Por ser uma doença neurológica crônica e progressiva torna-se capaz de reduzir a neurotransmissão dopaminérgica afetando as áreas motoras e sensitivas. Os sintomas depressivos nesses casos são potenciais sinais confundidores diagnósticos, dificultando a relação entre DP e os transtornos depressivos. Esse último é reconhecido pelos sinais e sintomas de tristeza incomum e permanente originada de situações negativas recorrentes. Considerações Finais A DP apresenta sinais e sintomas que prejudicam a qualidade de vida dos indivíduos, principalmente dos idosos, limitando as atividades da vida diária e os sintomas não motores como o transtorno depressivo que podem abreviar a evolução da DP, principalmente por muitas vezes confundir o diagnóstico.",

      "abstract": "Every physician faces the problem of dealing with mental symptoms in his patients. Mental symptoms are of very frequent occurrence. They may arise in the course of any disease process. Not infrequently cases appear in which a morbid mental state constitutes the essential etiologic soil out of which the somatic, or bodily, symptoms arise. On the other hand, organic disease is constantly giving rise to emotional or mental reactions. On whichever basis they may arise, much of the mental symptomatology commonly encountered can be interpreted by the general medical practitioner. The general physician often hesitates to deal with mental conditions, although he attacks with confidence problems of equally obscure organic, serologic or bacterial origin. For example, the clinician makes use of the technical researches of the specialist in cardiorenal disorders, or of the biochemist in diabetes, or of the endocrinologist in the use of complicated ductless gland therapy.

      "abstract": "Abstract Acomplicated interface exists between psychiatric and sleep disorders—psychiatric symptoms are amplified and aggravated by sleep disruption, and the pathology of psychiatric disorders may contribute to worsening sleep quality. In addition, persons with insomnia are at higher risk of developing a new psychiatric disorder, particularly major depression, within a year of the onset of insomnia. Psychiatric disorders can give rise to insomnia, excessive sleepiness, or parasomnias (eg, nightmares or sleep terrors) (Boxes 11–1 and 11–2).. It has been estimated that a third to a half of cases of chronic insomnia are associated with a psychiatric condition. Changes in sleep architecture include a decrease in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep latency that is seen with depressive episodes, schizophrenia, and borderline personality disorder. Schizophrenia (psychosis) is a chronic psychiatric disorder characterized by both “positive symptoms” (eg, hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized speech and behavior) and “negative symptoms” (eg, affective flattening, avolition [limited goal-directed behavior], and alogia [restricted thought and speech production]). This disabling condition has a median age of onset between 15 and 25 years of age. Course is chronic with significant impairments in self-care, interpersonal interactions, and work performance.",

      "title": "Epilepsy, cognition, and behavior: The clinical picture",
      "abstract": "Summary Although epilepsy is defined by the occurrence of spontaneous epileptic seizures, a large body of evidence indicates that epilepsy is linked to a spectrum of behavioral, psychiatric, and cognitive disorders as well as to sudden death. Explanations for these associations include the following: (1) The effects of structural lesions that may impair the functions subserved by the regions of the brain involved in the lesion. (2) The effects of seizure activity that may begin well before a clinical seizure occurs and may persist long after it is over, raising questions about what truly constitutes “interictal.” In addition, encephalopathic effects of epilepsy in infancy during critical periods in development may be particularly severe and potentially irreversible. (3) Shared mechanisms underlying seizures as well as these other disorders in the absence of structural lesions or separate diseases of the central nervous system (CNS). Epidemiologic and clinical studies demonstrate the elevated risk of cognitive, psychiatric, and behavioral disorders not just during but also prior to the onset of epilepsy (seizures) itself. These may outlast the active phase of epilepsy as well. The mounting evidence argues strongly for the recognition of epilepsy as part of a spectrum of disorders and against the notion that even uncomplicated epilepsy can a priori be considered benign.",

      "title": "Neuroanatomical and Etiological Approaches to Secondary Narcolepsy",
      "abstract": "Narcolepsy is one among the disorders of central hypersomnolence characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness not related to disturbances in nocturnal sleep or misalignment in circadian rhythms. The cardinal symptom of this group of disorders is disabling daytime sleepiness, characterized by the repeated episodes of irresistible daytime sleepiness or lapses into sleep in monotonous situations, but also under unusual conditions such as eating. Narcolepsy is defined as type 1 and type 2 on the basis of the presence of cataplexy. The most pathognomonic feature of narcolepsy type 1 is cataplexy, which is characterized by sudden episodes of brief loss of muscle tone-sparing consciousness, usually triggered by strong emotions. Other nonspecific symptoms associated with rapid eye movement sleep dissociation include fragmentation of nocturnal sleep, hypnagogic or hypnopompic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis. The pathophysiology of narcolepsy type 1 is well established as the deficiency of hypocretin (orexin) signaling in the lateral hypothalamus. In narcolepsy type 2, on the other hand, hypocretin levels are not decreased, and it has been suggested that there is probably a partial deficiency in hypocretin signaling system to cause excessive daytime sleepiness but not severe enough to cause cataplexy. Instead of types 1 and 2, primary (idiopathic) narcolepsy, familial narcolepsy, secondary (symptomatic) narcolepsy, and narcolepsy plus (hereditary forms with additional neurological symptoms) forms were suggested to better classify the clinical entities. In this paper, the diagnosis of symptomatic or secondary narcolepsy is reviewed and classified based on the underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms.",

Injury to the dorsiflexors or to any point along the neural pathways that supply these muscles can result in a foot drop. Injury to the peroneal nerve is usually the major precipitant. Other causes vary from trauma to surgical nerve injury, as well as leg compartment syndromes or dorsiflexor injuries, peripheral nerve injuries, stroke, neuropathies, drug toxicities, spinal stenosis, L5 sciaticas, systemic diseases such as connective tissue diseases, vasculidities, or diabetes. This report focuses on a patient presenting with a foot drop as an unusual manifestation of brain metastasis. His minimal symptomatology seemed to point towards a local process. Therefore, early recognition and prompt treatment are essential. The central nervous system must be the target of investigations when the workup fails to disclose the proper etiology. Potential diagnostic delays may occur. Certain cases may require a more aggressive approach.",

This review provides a brief account of the numerous conditions affecting the central, peripheral and intrinsic (enteric) nervous systems in which constipation can be the only clinical manifestation or a component of a complex syndrome. Recent neuropathophysiological acquisitions show that any structural or functional impairment of the intrinsic innervation of the gut, including both developmental (i.e., Hirschsprung's disease and intestinal neuronal dysplasia) and acquired (i.e., either degenerative or inflammatory neuropathies) disorders, can be associated with constipation. Constipation may also arise from derangements of the peripheral nervous system, including diabetes and primary chronic autonomic failure (pandysautonomias). Finally, in the central nervous system, a wide array of disorders (post-traumatic, degenerative, ischaemic or neoplastic) are recognized to determine bowel dysfunction, ultimately leading to constipation. Further understanding of the fine pathophysiological mechanisms through which the intrinsic and extrinsic nerve supplies to the digestive system are involved in idiopathic constipation or in diseases generating this symptom will hopefully lead to a better treatment of this frequent pathological condition.",

However, psychiatric or cognitive disorders have been reported in some patients treated using this technique. Age and a long disease history are two important risk factors for the appearance of these problems. The complications that have been reported include cases of depression, apathy, manias and psychosis. Surgery can also exacerbate the syndrome of addiction to levodopa that is sometimes observed. In contrast, sleep disorders usually improve with this technique. As far as the cognitive sphere is concerned, verbal fluency has been seen to deteriorate and the executive functions become impaired in patients over 69 years of age. These disorders are usually due to a number of different causes and have been attributed to the action of stimulating areas close to the subthalamic nucleus, to the presence of previously existing cognitive or psychiatric problems, to unrealistic expectations about this technique or to the individual's inability to adapt to the functional situation after surgery.Although generally speaking these disorders are not usually serious, they must be borne in mind so that adequate treatment can be indicated.",

In the early phases of illness, clinical features may substantially overlap, making accurate diagnosis difficult. To further confound this clinical conundrum, pathologically proven PSP may manifest as 3 distinct clinical phenotypes: PSP–pure akinesia with gait freezing (PSP-PAGF), Richardson syndrome (RS), and PSP parkinsonism (PSP-P).1 Patients with PSP-PAGF have pure akinesia with gait freezing. People with RS have a classic presentation with supranuclear gaze palsy as well as falls and dementia early in the course of the disorder. Those with PSP-P, however, have asymmetric onset, tremor, and moderate initial response to levodopa that may include dopa-induced dyskinesia. Given these overlapping features it is not surprising that early stages of PSP-P can be mistaken for PD, MSA, or even CBD.\n\nStandardized clinical diagnostic criteria for PSP known as the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)–SPSP criteria define probable and possible PSP, with definite PSP requiring histopathology.2 Vertical supranuclear gaze palsy and falls in the first year of disease onset are consistent with probable PSP while supranuclear gaze palsy alone or falls with slowness of vertical saccades are consistent with possible PSP. …",

      "abstract": "Τα τελευταία χρόνια κερδίζει έδαφος η ιδέα της υποκειμενικής γνωστικής έκπτωσης (ΥΓΕ) ως υποψηφίου ισοδυνάμου του προκλινικού σταδίου της νόσου Alzheimer. Ως υποκειμενική γνωστική έκπτωση (subjective cognitive decline) ορίζουμε την (αυθόρμητη ή μη) αναφορά από ένα άτομο παραπόνων για εμμένουσα έκπτωση της μνήμης ή άλλων γνωστικών λειτουργιών σε σχέση με το προηγούμενο επίπεδο, χωρίς από την αντικειμενική εξέταση να προκύπτει νευρογνωστική διαταραχή (ήπια γνωστική διαταραχή ή κλινική άνοια), λαμβανομένων υπόψη της ηλικίας, του φύλου και του μορφωτικού επιπέδου. Η έκπτωση πρέπει επίσης να μη σχετίζεται με κάποιο οξύ συμβάν και να μην μπορεί να εξηγηθεί από άλλη νευρολογική, ψυχιατρική ή παθολογική νόσο, λήψη φαρμάκων ή ουσιών. Τα δεδομένα υποδηλώνουν ότι τα άτομα αυτά έχουν αυξημένο κίνδυνο νόσησης από άνοια στο μέλλον και συνιστούν ελκυστικό ερευνητικό στόχο, τόσο για επιδημιολογικές, όσο και παρεμβατικές μελέτες.Εφόσον η ΥΓΕ είναι παράγοντας κινδύνου για τη μετέπειτα εγκατάσταση κλινικής άνοιας, είναι ιδιαίτερα ενδιαφέρον να μελετηθούν οι παράμετροι που θα μπορούσαν να επηρεάσουν αυτήν την εξέλιξη. Ένας από τους πιο ενδιαφέροντες παράγοντες που σχετίζονται με τον τρόπο ζωής είναι η διατροφή, η οποία προσφέρεται ως στόχος για την υιοθέτηση ευρείας κλίμακας στρατηγικών πρόληψης της γνωστικής έκπτωσης με καλή σχέση κόστους-αποτελεσματικότητας. Καθώς η διεθνής βιβλιογραφία παρουσιάζει σημαντικές ελλείψεις στη μελέτη της σχέσης ΥΓΕ και διατροφής, η παρούσα διδακτορική διατριβή φιλοδοξεί να συνεισφέρει στην κάλυψη αυτού του κενού. Για το σκοπό αυτό, η εργασία στηρίχθηκε στα δεδομένα της μελέτης HELIAD [Hellenic Epidemiological Longitudinal Investigation of Aging and Diet (Νευροεκφυλιστικές και άλλες νευρολογικές νόσοι στον ελληνικό πληθυσμό – συχνότητες και παράγοντες κινδύνου)] και κινήθηκε σε δύο παράλληλους σχεδιασμούς:1.Συγχρονική μελέτη (cross-sectional), με στόχο τη διερεύνηση του επιπολασμού συγκεκριμένων ειδών ΥΓΕ και της σχέσης τους με ποικίλους παράγοντες, μεταξύ των οποίων και τη διατροφή·2.Προοπτική μελέτη (prospective cohort), με στόχο τη διερεύνηση της επίδρασης της διατροφής στην εξέλιξη της ΥΓΕ στο χρόνο.Τα παράπονα που σχετίζονται με ΥΓΕ αναδείχθηκαν με τη βοήθεια ενός δομημένου καταλόγου ερωτήσεων/θεμάτων για συζήτηση με το συμμετέχοντα. Η ΥΓΕ ταξινομήθηκε ανάλογα με το γνωστικό πεδίο στο οποίο ο συμμετέχων εντοπίζει προβλήματα, δηλαδή τη μνήμη, το λόγο, την οπτική-αντιληπτική και την επιτελική λειτουργία. Οι συμμετέχοντες θεωρήθηκαν θετικοί για ένα είδος ΥΓΕ σε περίπτωση τουλάχιστον μίας θετικής απάντησης στις ερωτήσεις του συγκεκριμένου γνωστικού πεδίου. Η συνολική βαθμολογία ΥΓΕ ορίστηκε ως ο αριθμός των αναφερόμενων γνωστικών πεδίων με ΥΓΕ και συνεπώς κυμαίνεται από 0 ως 4.Με βάση τα ευρήματα από το συγχρονικό σκέλος της μελέτης, η ΥΓΕ στον ελληνικό πληθυσμό ≥65 ετών είναι πολύ συχνή (84,6%) και εστιάζεται κυρίως στη μνήμη. Τα συμπτώματα άγχους και η ύπαρξη αγγειακού εγκεφαλικού κινδύνου σχετίζονται με αυξημένη πιθανότητα ΥΓΕ, ενώ προστατευτικό ρόλο φαίνεται να έχει η εκπαίδευση. Όσον αφορά τα είδη ΥΓΕ, σημειώνεται η επιβαρυντική δράση του γυναικείου φύλου, της γενετικής προδιάθεσης για γνωστική έκπτωση και της αυξημένης ενεργειακής πρόσληψης στην εμφάνιση υποκειμενικής έκπτωσης στη μνήμη. Η παρουσία συμπτωμάτων κατάθλιψης ή/και άγχους και η πρόοδος της ηλικίας συνδέονται επίσης με τα περισσότερα είδη ΥΓΕ.Αναλύοντας τα δεδομένα από την προοπτική παρακολούθηση του δείγματός μας, υπολογίσαμε ότι αρχική συμμόρφωση με το διατροφικό πρότυπο της μεσογειακής δίαιτας υψηλότερη κατά 10 μονάδες στην κλίμακα MDS (Mediterranean Diet Score) σχετίζεται με μείωση κατά 7% στην εξέλιξη της ΥΓΕ ανά έτος, και ότι κάθε επιπλέον μερίδα λαχανικών καθημερινά σχετίζεται με περιορισμό κατά 2,2% της προόδου της ΥΓΕ ανά έτος. Τα αποτελέσματά μας ενισχύουν την άποψη ότι η μεσογειακή δίαιτα δρα προστατευτικά έναντι ολόκληρου του συνεχούς της γνωστικής έκπτωσης, ξεκινώντας από τα πρώτα γνωστικά παράπονα. Η επιβεβαίωση των ευρημάτων αυτών και από άλλες μελέτες, ιδίως για συγκεκριμένες ομάδες τροφίμων, και η αποσαφήνιση των υποκείμενων μηχανισμών μπορεί να ενδυναμώσει το ρόλο της μεσογειακής δίαιτας ως εύκολα εφαρμόσιμης, χαμηλού κόστους και υψηλής αποτελεσματικότητας στρατηγικής πρόληψης που στοχεύει τους τροποποιήσιμους παράγοντες κινδύνου για γνωστική έκπτωση.",

      "abstract": "As crises neonatais sao as manifestacoes mais comuns de disfuncao neurologica no recem-nascido. O prognostico das crises convulsivas e muito variavel, e em geral metade casos evolui de forma satisfatoria e a outra metade tem um risco maior para subsequente deficiencia intelectual, paralisia cerebral, epilepsia e morte. Por muitas decadas tem sido aceito que a etiologia das crises e o fator mais importante na predicao do prognostico do desenvolvimento neurologico, contudo ainda que persista a controversia se a crise neontais per se ou se outros fatores associados contribuem para o prognostico adverso, independentemente da etiologia. Este trabalho teve como objetivo investigar os fatores que contribuem para o prognostico adverso das crises neonatais e se as crises neonatais produzem efeitos neurologicos deleterios de longo prazo. Os estudos clinicos apontam que embora a etiologia subjacente as crises neonatais esteja relacionada com a gravidade do prognostico, outros fatores que incluiu a ultrasonografia craniana anormal, indice de resistencia anormal da arteria cerebral anterior, eletroencefalograma anormal, doenca cardiaca congenita e a semiologia das crises neonatais, aparecem tambem como um preditores independentes para o prognostico. Em modelos animais, as crises neonatais produzem prejuizos de longo prazo, tais como deficits na aprendizagem viso-espacial e na memoria de longo e curto prazo, prejuizo na flexibilidade cognitiva, aumento do estado de ansiedade, prejuizo no comportamento social e aumento da vulnerabilidade para a epileptogenese. Estudos clinicos e experimentais mostram evidencias que as crises neonatais per se produzem efeitos neurologicos deleterios de longo prazo.",

      "abstract": "Malingering, also called shamming illness or goldbricking, is the false and fraudulent simulation or exaggeration of physical or mental disease or defect, performed in order to obtain money or drugs or to evade duty or criminal responsibility, or for other reasons that may be readily understood by an objective observer from the individual's circumstances, rather than from learning the individual's psychology. Malingering is seen in apparently normal children, students, test subjects, spouses, and adults. It is not a mental disorder. Malingering may coexist with the antisocial personality disorder, with various factitious disorders, such as the Ganser Syndrome and the Munchausen Syndrome, with the hysterias and with traumatic neuroses and other mental disorders. A review of definitions and a medicolegal discussion are presented. Malingering is an act, which is distinguished from a legal or mental status. Failure to distinguish act from status accounts for the wide disparities in definitions of malingering.",

      "title": "Clinical aspects of depression in Parkinson's disease",
      "abstract": "Introduction Parkinson's disease is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder in the elderly population. The disease is clinically characterized by major motor symptoms that include bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor and postural instability. In addition to the motor symptoms, Parkinson‘s disease is characterized by emotional and cognitive deficits, which reduce quality of life independently from motor manifestations. Objectives/Aims To discuss the clinical manifestations of depression in Parkinson's disease according to the most recent scientific literature. Methods Online search/review of the literature has been carried out, using Medline/Pubmed, concerning, “Parkinson's disease” and “depression”. Results Depression is the most frequent psychiatric disorder in Parkinson's disease. In up to 30% of the cases, the depressive symptoms precede the development of motor symptoms. Independently of the age of appearance, duration and severity of the motor symptoms, depression is generally an integral part of the disease. Depression in Parkinson's disease is generally mild or moderate, with premature loss of self-esteem and volition. Although the high rates of suicidal ideation, suicide is rare. There is also a high prevalence of panic attacks and anxiety. Conclusions It is difficult to correctly identify depression in Parkinson's disease as some symptoms assigned to Parkinson's disease itself can in fact be the clinical manifestation of a depressive disorder. On the other hand, depressive symptoms may not be recognized as such, but considered manifestations of Parkinson's disease.

      "title": "Neuropsychiatry of Parkinson's Disease",
      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is traditionally regarded as a motor or a movement disorder. In recent years, however, an increased interest has been directed to its nonmotor symptoms as they seem to determine significant disability at all stages of the disease. Some PD patients consider their nonmotor symptoms even more disabling than motor signs. Among these nonmotor symptoms, neuropsychiatric syndromes (or behavioral and psychological symptoms) are of paramount importance. They include a wide array of syndromes such as anxiety, depression, psychosis, impulse control disorders, apathy, and cognitive dysfunction. Their pathogenesis in PD is rather complex, involving neurodegenerative, drug-related, and psychological mechanisms. Their recognition and management represent a great challenge.\r\n\r\nThe paper by R. de la Fuente-Fernandez presents a staging model named PD-related frontostriatal cognitive dysfunction (PDFCD) that provides a clinical and hypothesis-testing framework for neuropsychiatric syndromes in PD. De La Fuente-Fernandez's PDFCD model proposes three stages based on the sequential process of dopamine depletion occurring in different regions of the striatum (stages I and II) and the frontal cortex (stage III). Therefore, PD patients would present executive dysfunction and mental fatigue (stage I), depression/anxiety (stage IIa), apathy/pain (stage IIb), and dementia (stage III).\r\n\r\nThe paper by J. Calleo et al. summarizes the current literature on the cognitive rehabilitation programs in PD patients. Despite limited available data and heterogeneity of motor and nonmotor symptoms in PD, cognitive rehabilitation seems to be promising in this context.\r\n\r\nThe paper by Y. Bogdanova and A. Cronin-Golomb1 presents an original study that assessed cognitive correlates of anxiety and apathy in PD patients. In comparison with matched controls, PD patients exhibited higher levels of anxiety and apathy which were correlated with disease duration. Interestingly, anxiety and apathy correlated differently with cognitive functions. The question remains open whether the treatment of both conditions impacts on cognitive functioning in PD.\r\n\r\nUntil recently, most studies have focused on the impact of motor disability and depressive symptoms on the quality of life of PD patients, neglecting the role of anxiety. The paper by K. K. Hanna and A. Cronin-Golomb addressed this issue, reporting that anxiety, more than depressive, cognitive, and motor symptoms, significantly affected quality of life in PD.\r\n\r\nDopaminergic strategies remain the mainstay of PD treatment. However, they are frequently associated with neuropsychiatric syndromes, notably psychosis. Alternative therapeutic options have been searched in the last years, and adenosine A2A receptor antagonists seem to be very promising. The paper by C. J. Bleickardt et al. demonstrates that, in comparison with dopamine receptor agonists, adenosine A2A antagonists exhibit better neuropsychiatric profiles as they do not interfere with prepulse inhibition in rodents (a model of psychosis). \r\n\r\nThe paper by E. C. Lauterbach et al. presents a comprehensive review of the neuroprotective effects of the psychotropic drugs used in PD.\r\n\r\n\r\nAntonio L. Teixeira\r\n\r\nLeonardo F. Fontenelle\r\n\r\nEdward C.

      "title": "Parkinson’s Disease and Parkinsonian Tremor",
      "abstract": "Abstract Tremor is a common symptom of hypokinetic-rigid syndromes such as Parkinson disease. The classical tremor of Parkinson disease is an asymmetric pill-rolling resting tremor of the arms, but postural tremor (including re-emergent and pure postural tremor) and kinetic tremor are also very common. Tremor in atypical parkinsonism is often a symmetric postural tremor that can be jerkier in nature. The pathophysiology of rest tremor in Parkinson disease involves abnormal activity within both the basal ganglia and a cerebello-thalamo-cortical motor circuit, driven by altered dopaminergic, noradrenergic, and serotonergic projections arising from the midbrain. The dopaminergic basis of Parkinson’s tremor differs markedly between individuals and between clinical tremor phenotypes. Dopaminergic treatment (levodopa and dopamine agonists) is the first-choice treatment for rest and re-emergent tremor in Parkinson disease, and probably also rest tremor in atypical parkinsonism. Other pharmacological options include anticholinergics, beta-blockers, or even clozapine, although evidence for these treatment strategies is limited. Additionally, stereotactic surgery including focal lesioning and deep brain stimulation of both basal ganglia (GPi and STN) and thalamus (ventral intermediate nucleus, VIM) are effective treatments for most types of tremor in Parkinson disease.",

      "title": "Review: Parkinson's disease: from synaptic loss to connectome dysfunction",
      "abstract": "Abstract Parkinson's disease ( PD ) is a common neurodegenerative disorder with prominent loss of nigro‐striatal dopaminergic neurons. The resultant dopamine ( DA ) deficiency underlies the onset of typical motor symptoms ( MS ). Nonetheless, individuals affected by PD usually show a plethora of nonmotor symptoms ( NMS ), part of which may precede the onset of motor signs. Besides DA neuron degeneration, a key neuropathological alteration in the PD brain is Lewy pathology. This is characterized by abnormal intraneuronal (Lewy bodies) and intraneuritic (Lewy neurites) deposits of fibrillary aggregates mainly composed of α ‐synuclein. Lewy pathology has been hypothesized to progress in a stereotypical pattern over the course of PD and α ‐synuclein mutations and multiplications have been found to cause monogenic forms of the disease, thus raising the question as to whether this protein is pathogenic in this disorder. Findings showing that the majority of α ‐synuclein aggregates in PD are located at presynapses and this underlies the onset of synaptic and axonal degeneration, coupled to the fact that functional connectivity changes correlate with disease progression, strengthen this idea. Indeed, by altering the proper action of key molecules involved in the control of neurotransmitter release and re‐cycling as well as synaptic and structural plasticity, α ‐synuclein deposition may crucially impair axonal trafficking, resulting in a series of noxious events, whose pressure may inevitably degenerate into neuronal damage and death. Here, we provide a timely overview of the molecular features of synaptic loss in PD and disclose their possible translation into clinical symptoms through functional disconnection.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Nonmotor symptoms (NMS) are an important prodromal feature of Parkinson's disease (PD). However, their frequency, treatment rates, and impact on health‐related quality of life (HRQoL) in the early motor phase is unclear. Rates of NMS in enriched at‐risk populations, such as first‐degree PD relatives, have not been delineated. We assessed NMS in an early cohort of PD, first‐degree PD relatives and control subjects to address these questions. In total, 769 population‐ascertained PD subjects within 3.5 years of diagnosis, 98 first‐degree PD relatives, and 287 control subjects were assessed at baseline across the following NMS domains: (1) neuropsychiatric; (2) gastrointestinal; (3) sleep; (4) sensory; (5) autonomic; and (6) sexual. NMS were much more common in PD, compared to control subjects. More than half of the PD cases had hyposmia, pain, fatigue, sleep disturbance, or urinary dysfunction. NMS were more frequent in those with the postural instability gait difficulty phenotype, compared to the tremor dominant (mean total number of NMS 7.8 vs. 6.2; P &lt; 0.001). PD cases had worse HRQoL scores than controls (odds ratio: 4.1; P &lt; 0.001), with depression, anxiety, and pain being stronger drivers than motor scores. NMS were rarely treated in routine clinical practice. First‐degree PD relatives did not significantly differ in NMS, compared to controls, in this baseline study.

The combination of lesions of multiple subcorticocortical systems with different degrees of direct cortical pathology due to Lewy bodies and neuritic plaques may explain most of the changes, from depression to dementia.It is necessary to test these concepts using studies based on specific predictions derived from pathophysiological models.

      "title": "Different abnormalities of electroencephalographic (EEG) markers in quiet wakefulness are related to motor visual hallucinations in patients with Parkinson’s and Lewy body diseases",
      "abstract": "Abstract Background Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second‐most common neurodegenerative disorder that affects 2–3% of the population ≥ 65 years of age and may belong to cognitive deficits and dementia in 50% of cases. Disease with Lewy Bodies (DLB) is emerging as another important cause of dementia in pathological aging. PD and DLB are both due to intra‐neuronal Lewy bodies and are characterized not only by motor dysfunctions but also by cognitive and/or psychiatric symptoms. An open issue is the extent to which these diseases are distinct entities. In this respect, here we compared cortical sources of resting state eyes‐closed electroencephalographic (rsEEG) rhythms in PD and DLB patients having visual hallucinations. Method Clinical and rsEEG rhythms in demographic matched PD (N = 93), DLB (N = 46), Alzheimer’s disease dementia (AD, N= 70) and healthy elderly (Nold, N = 60) subjects were available from an international archive. Pathological groups were matched for cognitive status. Individual alpha frequency peak was used to determine the delta, theta, alpha1, alpha2, and alpha3 frequency band ranges. Fixed beta1, beta2, and gamma bands were considered. The eLORETA freeware estimated rsEEG cortical sources. Result As a confirmation of previous studies, compared to the Nold subjects, the AD, LBD, and PD patients showed higher widespread delta source activities and lower posterior alpha source activities. Specifically, posterior alpha source activities were more abnormal in the AD than the LBD and PD groups, while widespread delta source activities were more abnormal in the PD and DLB than the AD group. As novel results, in relation to the LBD and PD patients without visual hallucinations and the control groups (Nold, AD), those with visual hallucinations were characterized by higher parietal delta source activities (LBD, Figure 1) and parieto‐occipital alpha sources activities (PD, Figure 2). Conclusion These novel results suggest that in LBD and PD patients resting in the quiet wakefulness, abnormalities in cortical neural synchronization at delta and alpha frequencies in parietal cortex are differently related to visual hallucinations despite the essence of alpha‐synucleinopathy.",

      "abstract": "Diverse neuromuscular disorders can complicate the course of a severely ill patient. Critical illness polyneuropathy (CIP) is the most precisely defined neuromuscular complication in this context. It is characterized by a primary axonal degeneration of the motor and sensory nerve fibers with degeneration of the skeletal muscles as a result of their denervation. The precise etiology of CIP remains elusive. Electrophysiology must be used to confirm the diagnosis of CIP because clinical evaluation is clearly insufficient and testing can also exclude other entities such as a Guillain-Barré syndrome or a primary disorder of neuromuscular transmission. Nerve biopsy studies are not required for a diagnosis of CIP. Other disorders can explain neurophysiological abnormalities in critically ill patients after the use of neuromuscular blocking agents, such as persistent neuromuscular junction blockade, pure axonal neuropathy, and necrotizing myopathy. The incidence of myopathies in critically ill patients is not well characterized, although the incidence most likely is high in critically ill patients with prolonged stay in the intensive care unit (ICU). The clinical picture of a primary myopathy is indistinguishable from other ICU-acquired causes of neuromuscular disease. Three main forms of myopathies in the ICU have been described: critical illness myopathy, thick filament myopathy, and necrotizing myopathy. Myopathies are difficult to detect because the neurophysiological studies are neither sensitive nor specific and a muscle biopsy is required.",

      "title": "Medically unexplained symptoms",
      "abstract": "The term medically unexplained symptoms refers to physical symptoms for which there is either no or insufficient evidence of any underlying conventional disease/disorder process. There is a wide spectrum of severity ranging from essentially normal experience (e.g. an occasional headache) to symptoms which result in severe and long-standing disability. Where symptoms group together in clusters suggestive of a link to a particular bodily system, they have been termed functional somatic syndromes. The term somatoform disorders refers to a specific set of formal psychiatric diagnoses involving conditions which predominantly present with physical symptoms or a worry about physical disease. Only people at the more severe end of the medically unexplained symptoms spectrum meet criteria for one of the somatoform disorders and there is considerable dissatisfaction with the current psychiatric classification system for these conditions, which is discussed later in this chapter. Functional somatic syndromes By the time most people with medically unexplained symptoms are referred to a liaison psychiatrist, they are likely to have picked up a label of one or more of the functional somatic syndromes (e.g. irritable bowel syndrome, functional dyspepsia, fibromyalgia). Many different functional syndromes have been described over the past 30 years according to different symptom clusters (Table 6.1). There is considerable overlap in symptoms between different functional conditions and somatoform disorders, yet most of these syndromes are studied as if they are discrete conditions within particular medical specialties, with a focus on the specific set of somatic symptoms, which are specialty specific. There is still uncertainty as to the degree of overlap of these conditions and the relative common factors they may share. In one study, Fink et al (2007) studied 978 patients admitted to hospital from primary care and a medical and neurological department who scored highly on somatic screening measures. They found that patients complained of a median of five functional somatic symptoms (women six and men four). Principal component analysis identified three symptom groups explaining 37% of the variance: cardiopulmonary, musculoskeletal and gastrointestinal. Further analysis showed that the symptom groups were not discrete and patients were likely to report symptoms from different groups, suggesting that the groups were different manifestations of a common latent phenomenon: bodily distress.",

      "abstract": "Global hypoactivity contrasting with apparently unaffected cognitive abilities was initially reported in cases of frontal damage and is now recognized as a leading behavioral feature of many cerebral diseases. Of the various terms used to refer to this behavioral change, \"apathy\" is now the most widely used. Global hypoactivity with apathy is easy to diagnose in patients without other obvious neuropsychiatric impairments. In other clinical contexts, the diagnosis of global hypoactivity with apathy requires the physician to first establish that hypoactivity and loss of motivation cannot be more readily explained by sensorimotor impairments (e.g., as observed in patients with stroke or Parkinson's disease) or cognitive impairments (e.g., as observed in patients with Alzheimer's disease). Many criteria and behavioral scales have been used to diagnose hypoactivity with apathy. The main differential diagnosis is depression and depressive symptoms, and distinguishing between these conditions and apathy may be particularly challenging. The mechanisms of hypoactivity with apathy remain uncertain and probably involve several dysfunctions, including the inability to attach motivational values to stimuli. We reviewed the frequency, characteristics, and determinants of hypoactivity with apathy in Alzheimer's disease, frontotemporal lobar degeneration, Parkinson's disease, and stroke, across the different stages of cognitive compromise. The diagnosis of this condition is an important step in identifying the source of difficulties in patients' activities of daily living.",

      "abstract": "An epileptic seizure is a “transient occurrence of signs and/or symptoms due to abnormal excessive or synchronous neuronal activity in the brain.” Epilepsy is a disorder of the brain characterized by an enduring predisposition to generate epileptic seizures and by the neurobiological, cognitive, psychological, and social consequences of this condition. The widely accepted operational definition of epilepsy requires that an individual have at least two unprovoked seizures on separate days, generally 24 hours apart. An unprovoked seizure refers to a seizure that occurs in the absence of an acute brain insult or systemic disorder. This nosology is based on the observation that while a single unprovoked seizure is often an isolated event that does not recur during an individual’s lifetime, two unprovoked seizures rarely occur in isolation and are associated with high risk of the individual experiencing more seizures. In some cases, such as when the seizure occurs in the setting of a potentially epileptogenic brain insult such as an episode of encephalitis or a traumatic brain injury (TBI), it is possible to recognize the specific form of epilepsy at its earliest presentation. In such cases, the diagnosis of epilepsy can be made after the very first unprovoked seizure. Based on its definition, epilepsy is not a single disorder but rather a syndrome or syndromes. Different forms of epilepsy syndrome(s) have different causes, different manifestations, different implications for short- and longterm management and treatment, and different outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Le retard mental n’est pas a proprement parler un trouble psychopathologique distinct, mais un ensemble de conditions tres diverses ayant trois denominateurs communs : 1) l’enfant ou l’adolescent a un fonctionnement intellectuel nettement inferieur a la moyenne, 2) ce fonctionnement limite son adaptation dans differents domaines importants, et 3) le trouble debute avant l’âge de 18 ans, habituellement pendant la petite enfance ou l’enfance. Ce retard se caracterise essentiellement par un developpement limite des facultes intellectuelles et du fonctionnement adaptatif. Le fonctionnement intellectuel est defini dans la plupart des cas par le QI qui doit etre inferieur de deux ecarts-types ou plus a la moyenne sur un test standardise, et qui est utilise pour qualifier le retard de leger, moyen, grave ou profond. Retenons que le DSM-IV precise que le retard mental ne peut etre diagnostique qu’en presence de deficits du fonctionnement intellectuel et adaptatif. Notons aussi que les enfants atteints de retard mental sont, comme tous les enfants, des « etres complets » dont il faut apprendre a connaitre tous les aspects et non seulement les aspects cognitifs, et qu’il importe de mettre l’accent aujourd’hui sur l’enfant atteint de retard mental en tant que personne a part entiere pour decouvrir comment cet enfant negocie son environnement en fonction non seulement de ses limitation intellectuelles et adaptatives, mais aussi de l’ensemble de ses capacites.",

      "title": "[Do neuromyosites exist?].",
      "abstract": "Neuromyositis defined as the association of dermatomyositis or polymyositis and a neuropathy without any found cause is a very controversial entity because of the possibility of, in one hand, muscular modifications caused by neurological involvement and, on the other hand, neurogenic type manifestations caused by polymyositis. The study of 4 cases seen in an Internal Medicine department and the review of the literature allowed us to show that the concept of neuromyositis corresponds to a clinico-pathological reality when the diagnosis is based on the association of definite criteria of both primary muscle and nerve involvement excluding muscular abnormalities that could be the consequence of nerve involvement and vice versa. The criteria, most relevant when associated are: a) for muscular involvement: high increase of muscular enzyme over 6 times the superior limit of the normal values, pseudomyotonic electrical discharges, perifascicular atrophy, intense inflammatory infiltrates and massive necrosis, b) for neurological involvement: early abolition of tendinous reflexes in a patient without notable muscular atrophy and with little or no myalgia, sensitive abnormalities in areas other than those of muscular involvement, especially when they are intense, early weakness of distal muscles, decrease of nerve conduction speed, target fibers and lesions of nerve trunks (and albuminocytological dissociation in the particular case of polyradiculoneuritis). Once the diagnosis of neuropathy settled, it is necessary to exclude an usual cause (alcoholism, diabetes...) before concluding to neuromyositis. When we apply these restrictive (but nevertheless necessary for the validity of diagnosis) criteria, only 6 cases of the literature respond to this entity. It is a peripheral neuropathy in 5 cases (like two of ours) and a polyradiculoneuritis in one case (like our two others). Among these 6 cases, there is a vasculitis in two, frequency much higher to what is observed in adult polymyositis, which suggest a possible causative role of vascular involvement in neuropathy arising. In the other cases we can just give pathogenic hypothesis making the neuropathy and the polymyositis the result of the same process (immunological disturbance, paraneoplastic origin, viral disease). In one of our four patients, who have shown an HTLV-I infection by polymerase chain reaction in situ hybridization was positive in muscle which suggest a direct pathogenic role of the virus. HTLV-I infection should be considered as a possible cause of neuromyositis especially in endemic areas.",

These criteria allow to make the diagnosis of \"probable\" or \"possible\" dementia associated with DLBD. With certainty this form of dementia can only be diagnosed by neuropathological examination which reveals diffuse cortical Lewy bodies. At present there is no agreement whether DLBD is a variant of Alzheimer's disease or a separate nosological entity--the second commonest cause of dementia. The main clinical feature of DLBD is coexistence of dementia and symptoms of parkinsonian syndrome. The other important feature which differentiates between DLBD and other forms of dementia is a very considerable early fluctuation of cognitive state. Psychotic symptoms in the course of DLBD--visual and auditory hallucinations, delusions and depression--are common. At present treatment of DLBD is unknown. Treatment of psychotic symptoms is difficult because of the presence of parkinsonism.",

The global incidence of Parkinson's disease is 1.5 times higher in men than in women; however, in South Korea, the incidence has been reported to be 1.4 times higher in women than in men. Tremors are more predominant in women, and women tend to display better movement disorders and cognitive function than men. Nonetheless, women face a higher risk of developing dyskinesia and motor complications related to long-term levodopa treatment. Sex/gender differences in non-motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease are also apparent. Women suffer more severely from depression, anxiety, gastrointestinal motility disorders, and pain than men, and the decline in quality of life due to non-motor symptoms is more pronounced in women. Even when motor complications from the progression of Parkinson's disease worsen, female patients are less likely to undergo surgical treatments, including deep brain stimulation, than male patients.",

Unitil now very few reports of such studies have been published. The investigations have been uncontrolled or carried out on small or inhomogeneous materials. This investigation is triple‐blind, clinically controlled, and the material is very homogeneous. After 6 months' levodopa treatment no significant effect is shown either on a broad spectrum of psychiatric items or in cognitive functioning. This negative result is discussed.

      "title": "Public health and insomnia: economic impact.",
      "abstract": "There seems to be a lack of understanding between practitioners and patients on the topic of insomnia. One adult out of four complains of insomnia; however only one insomniac out of four has ever complained about it to their practitioner during a visit made for another problem and only one out of twenty has come to discuss specifically the problem of his or her insomnia. Only a few patients with insomnia take a treatment for it. This gap between the patient's feeling and the practitioner's answer has to be better understood if we want to know why insomnia seems to be so prevalent and what impact it has on society. One aspect may be a question of definition. Insomnia may be considered an ordinary complaint (after one poor night) or as a chronic disease. Practitioners have poor knowledge about sleep disorders and may be embarrassed about coping with an impairment they never specifically learned to manage. The second aspect concerns the impact of insomnia on daytime alertness and performance. While patients usually complain of an impaired daytime functioning with a feeling of fatigue, sleepiness, and risk of mistakes, many studies of insomniacs do not reveal any increased sleepiness or decrease of performance (measured by objective tests) the day following a poor night. Practitioners may therefore find it difficult to understand the real impact of insomnia on daytime functioning. The third aspect is related to the large co-morbidity between insomnia and psychiatric diseases, especially depression and anxiety. It does make it harder for practitioners to define whether the sleep impairment suffered by their patient is the cause for other symptoms or the consequence of an underlying disease. Thus, it makes it all the more difficult for the practitioner to determine which treatment is the most appropriate. These aspects have to be clarified if one wants to estimate the real impact of insomnia on society. It could be useful to both practitioners and patients to have a better understanding on the relationship between poor sleep and daily lives.",

      "title": "Obsessive–compulsive disorder as the onset of bipolar disorder in adolescence",
      "abstract": "The onset of bipolar disorder (BD) usually occurs during adolescence or early adulthood. Several studies show an alarming duration of untreated illness (5 years) with 60% of people with BD reporting 1–4 different diagnoses before that of BD, with consequent treatment delay. In recent years, a growing interest in preliminary phases of BD or sub-syndromic signs has been reported. Obsessive–compulsive disorder often anticipates the onset of bipolar disorder with serious consequences due to treatment delay, self-threatening behaviors, and admissions. Several clinical features have been linked to a higher risk of developing disorders from the bipolar spectrum (e.g., mood switches, emotional lability, depressive episodes, anxiety, sleep disorders, attention deficits, behavioral disturbance, and substance use disorder). Such symptoms or syndromes may be shown some years (from 1.8 to 7.3) before an acute manic or hypomanic episode and adolescents with anxiety disorders are more prone to developing BD in early adulthood.1 As a consequence, anxiety disorders might be predictive of BD onset.2 In particular, the prevalence of obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) in BD patients is around 17%, with an even higher comorbidity during adolescence (24.2%) compared to adulthood (13.5%). OCD might represent a key feature in the onset of BD if shown during adolescence. In fact, prior OCD is associated with the development of BD with a hazard ratio of 6.9.3 Moreover, anxiety has a negative impact on BD outcomes since it is associated with a worse prognosis, increasing self-threatening behaviors, and substance misuse. Diagnostic delays have serious consequences linked to inappropriate treatments, increasing admissions and suicide risk. The identification of prodromal symptoms is crucial to detect subjects at higher risk, taking advantage of a clinical staging model. Furthermore, a progression from OCD to BD should be strictly taken into consideration when treatment options are scrutinized. The NICE and APA guidelines suggest cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT; including exposure and response prevention - ERP) as the first option in the treatment of OCD during adolescence, with prescription of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) if the patient declines psychotherapy or symptoms persist and compromise their quality of life. Unfortunately, antidepressant prescription may elicit manic symptoms and facilitate the onset of BD. Accordingly, pharmacological options should be carefully evaluated and close monitoring is highly recommended. No conflict of interest to disclose.

Accounts are more numerous for PD and PMD, where diagnostic tests, such as DAT scan and psychological assessment, support clinical orientation. The correct diagnosis was achieved in all cases following the recognition of inconsistencies in the first judgment and of distinctive clinical features of dystonia.

      "abstract": "Neurology deals with organic diseases of the muscles, the peripheral nerves of the trunk and extremities, and the central nervous system (spinal cord, brain, stem, cerebellum, and cerebrum). Diseases that lead to dysfunction of these structures can cause both physical and cognitive problems. Therefore, neurological diseases can particularly impair personal mobility through both physical limitations and cognitive deficits. Many of the diseases show a significant increase in frequency with age.Physical impairments in mobility primarily manifest as gait disorders. These are found to a relevant extent in two-thirds of people older than 80 years of age and are a common cause of falls, often with considerable sequelae. Driving a car can have negative effects, for example, on reaction speed, braking power, and looking over the shoulder. Parkinson's disease as well as paralysis and sensory disorders in the context of polyneuropathies can be responsible for this.Driving a car is an obvious compensatory mechanism with respect to impaired walking ability. However, the cause of many diseases that affect the fitness to walk lies in the central nervous system, often in the area of the cerebrum. Consequently, cognitive deficits manifest themselves in addition to physical ones, which further restrict mobility through the loss of the fitness to drive. Neurological diseases typical of old age that limit mobility in this way include Parkinson's disease and circulatory disorders of the brain. In addition, epileptic seizures occur more frequently in old age as a symptom of other diseases.",

Fatigue has been variously hypothesized to be caused by dysfunction of the striato-thalamo-cortical loop, abnormalities in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, inflammatory processes, and neurotransmitter abnormalities within the central nervous system. However, there is no firm evidence that any of these proposed etiologies explain the fatigue experienced by patients who have PD or other diseases. Fatigue may be associated with depression, sleep disorders, and medication-induced adverse effects, but it also remains a distinct symptom that can occur independently from these other disorders and problems. Fatigue is a persistent symptom in individual patients, and it is unrelated to disease severity. Fatigue is difficult to define and even more difficult to measure. Several questionnaires are available to measure fatigue, but many of these are disease-specific and do not apply to patients who have PD. Some questionnaires measure general overall fatigue, whereas others measure different aspects of fatigue, including mental, physical, emotional, motivational, and exertional fatigue. Often fatigue is confused with sleepiness, a related but distinct construct. Clearly, fatigue has a significantly negative impact on the quality of life and physical function of patients with PD. Currently, there is no proven effective treatment for this problematic nonmotor symptom of PD. Additional research is needed to provide a better understanding of this complex problem.",

      "abstract": "In Parkinson’s disease (PD) the quality of life (QoL) of a patient is adversely affected by both the motor and non-motor symptoms of the disease. The fact that QoL is reduced in the early stages of PD may well be related to the fact that non-motor symptoms are a key factor in QoL, and these often pre-date motor symptoms. Important non-motor symptoms include depression, dementia and dribbling of saliva. The link between non-motor symptoms and reduced QoL has important implications for the management of PD because the early non-motor symptoms often appear before patients are given antiparkinsonian therapy (as motor symptoms are usually the trigger for starting therapy) and almost every patient with PD has non-motor symptoms. To improve QoL, treatment needs to be started at the point of diagnosis. Furthermore, subsequent monitoring of non-motor symptoms and choice of appropriate treatment to reduce non-motor symptoms are both key to improving QoL. Many non-motor symptoms can potentially be reduced using dopaminergic treatment, and data are beginning to emerge on the effects of continuous dopaminergic stimulation (CDS) treatment on non-motor symptoms. The rotigotine patch may improve sleep/fatigue, mood/cognition, pain and QoL; subcutaneous apomorphine infusion may improve sleep, depression/anhedonia, nocturia and pain; and intraduodenal levodopa infusion may improve cardiovascular symptoms, sleep, perception, QoL and gastrointestinal, urinary and sexual symptoms. The differences in effect on non-motor symptoms of different CDS treatments may indicate a future where treatment can be directed at improving specific non-motor symptoms and thus the QoL of people with PD.",

The prevalence of Parkinson disease is reported to be approximately 1% in people 60 years of age and older increases to 1% to 3% in the 80 plus age groups. Risk factors included oxidative stress, the formation of free radicals and environmental toxins. The most frequently reported symptoms in Parkinson disease are tremors in one hand, other symptoms showing slowness in movement, stiffness and loss of balance. Various diagnostic test performed to rule out Parkinson’s disease that is brain imaging, dopamine active transporter (DaT) scan, skin biopsy etc. Parkinson’s disease can be managed by combination of drugs like levodopa and monoamine oxidase (MAO)-B inhibitors.",

      "title": "Pain management in patients with Parkinson&amp;#39;s disease: challenges and solutions",
      "abstract": "Abstract: This review focuses on the diagnosis and management of Parkinson-related pain which is one of the more frequently reported nonmotor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD), which is the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's disease. Pain is ranked high by patients as a troublesome symptom in all stages of the disease. In early-stage PD, pain is rated as the most bothersome symptom. Knowledge of the correct diagnosis of pain origin and possible methods of treatments for pain relief in PD is of great importance. The symptoms have a great negative impact on health-related quality of life. Separating PD-related pain from pain of other origins is an important challenge and can be characterized as \"many syndromes under the same umbrella\". Among the different forms of PD-related pain, musculoskeletal pain is the most common form, accounting for 40%–90% of reported pain in PD patients. Augmentation by pathophysiological pathways other than those secondary to rigidity, tremor, or any of the other motor manifestations of the disease seems most probable. In PD, the basal ganglia process somatosensory information differently, and increased subjective pain sensitivity with lower electrical and heat-pain thresholds has been reported in PD patients. The mechanism is assumed to be diminished activity of the descending inhibitory control system of the basal ganglia. PD pain, like many of the nonmotor symptoms, remains underdiagnosed and, thus, poorly managed. A systematic collection of patient descriptions of type, quality, and duration of pain is, therefore, of utmost importance. Recent studies have validated new and more specific and dedicated pain scales for PD-related symptoms. Symptomatic treatments based on clinical pain classification include not only pharmacological but also nonpharmacological methods and, to some degree, invasive approaches. In the clinic, pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions can be effective to varying degrees – as single therapies or in combination – and should be employed, because no therapeutic strategies have been validated to date for managing PD pain. Multimodal approaches should always be considered, dopamine replacement therapies should be adjusted, and analgesics and/or antidepressants should be considered, including the use of different forms of complementary therapies.

Development We review the most relevant about sensory symptoms in PD: visual dysfunction, olfactory dysfunction, taste, hearing loss, and pain and other sensitive associate symptoms. Conclusions Pain is frequently observed in patients with PD, being its prevalence high and probably infra diagnosed. Its identification and classification is very important for a correct treatment. Hyposmia is a common symptom in PD and could be a predictor of future PD. Visual dysfunction and hearing dysfunction among others must be considered in patients with PD.",

Dementia, psychoses, and emotional disorders, such as depression and anxiety/panic disorder, also impair behavior. Symptoms may be produced by dysfunction of the central nervous system, medication, and/or the psychosocial problems associated with Parkinson's disease. Treatment therefore should be based on the cause of the symptoms seen. In some cases, the reduction or change of antiparkinsonian drugs, or both, may be effective. Treatment of the motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease, including motor fluctuations, may reduce the risk of panic attacks being evoked in the 'off' period.

      "abstract": "Sleep disorders are common in the general adult population and are associated with adverse effects such as motor vehicle collisions, decreased quality of life, and increased mortality. Patients with sleep disorders can be categorized into three groups: people with problems falling asleep, people with behavior and movement disturbances during sleep, and people with excessive daytime sleepiness. Insomnia, the most common sleep disorder, is defined by difficulty initiating sleep, maintaining sleep, or both, resulting in daytime consequences. Insomnia is diagnosed by history and is treated with cognitive behavior therapy, with or without medications. Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder is characterized by increased muscle tone during rapid eye movement sleep, resulting in patients acting out their dreams with potentially harmful effects. Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder is diagnosed by polysomnography and treated with melatonin or clonazepam. Restless legs syndrome is defined by an urge to move the legs that worsens when at rest. Restless legs syndrome is treated with gabapentin or dopamine agonists, depending on the severity. Narcolepsy is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and sleep hallucinations. Diagnosis is suggested by the history and can be confirmed with polysomnography and a multiple sleep latency test the following day. Narcolepsy is treated with behavior modifications and medications such as stimulants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, sodium oxybate, and pitolisant. Obstructive sleep apnea may be diagnosed in patients with excessive snoring and witnessed apneas and can be diagnosed using overnight polysomnography. Treatment consists of positive airway pressure therapy while sleeping in conjunction with weight loss.",

      "title": "Delirium and Dementia",
      "abstract": "Emergency physicians are frequently presented with patients exhibiting neurobehavioral abnormalities. These can be a harbin­ ger of a serious medical condition, and critical decisions must be made expeditiously about diagnostic evaluation, therapeutic intervention, and disposition. The first critical action is to recog­ nize the presence of the neurobehavioral abnormality. The second is to distinguish delirium from dementia or some other neuropsy­ chiatric condition. In the past, terms such as acute confusional state, sundowning, and organic brain syndrome have been used to describe a host of abnormal cognitive states that can be observed in the emer­ gency setting. These terms have loosely defined a group of neurobehavioral disorders that are caused by a physiologic dis­ turbance. Organic brain syndrome is a nebulous term that the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (fourth edition, text revision) eschews because the “organic” connotation implies that so­called functional mental disorders are without a biologic basis. Several key features best distinguish delirium from dementia: the time course of disease evolution, the presence of autonomic system involvement, the level of consciousness, and the presence of an underlying disease processes. Delirium is characterized by a fluctuating level of neurobehavioral disturbance typically pro­ gressing during minutes to hours to days. Delirium is a direct consequence of an acute systemic or central nervous system (CNS) stressor. Dementia, on the other hand, tends to follow a more gradual course, with evolution during months to years. Although patients with dementia exhibit confusion, disturbance in level of consciousness usually is not a feature, and manifestations of auto­ nomic nervous system abnormalities are minimal or absent. The evaluation of patients who present to the emergency department (ED) with a disturbance of neurobehavioral state is best conducted in accordance with the following basic guidelines: 1. The first step is to determine whether this state represents delirium or dementia. The clinical findings may be subtle, and establishment of the diagnosis can be challenging, especially because delirium may be superimposed on dementia and dementia remains an independent risk factor for delirium. Early symptoms and signs may go unrecognized unless an adequate history is obtained from the patient, family members, and caregivers. A careful examination must include memory and cognitive assessment with a mental status screening examination. 2. Supportive care must be provided. This care may range in extent from aggressive airway and cardiovascular support to pharmacologic or physical restraint to simply placing the patient in a quiet room with appropriate environmental support. 3. A diligent search must be initiated for the underlying precipitating stressors in patients presenting with delirium.",

Prevalence of \"reversible dementias\" varies between 1 and 40 %. Being potentially reversible, it remains essential to investigate and treat potentially reversible causes of dementia or dementia-like symptoms. High level of clinical suspicion is necessary to recognize these conditions. Therefore, an extensive list of potentially reversible conditions that may either cause or mimic dementia is reviewed, and their neuropsychiatric aspects described. Diagnosis is made by thorough history, neurological and physical examination combined with certain routine tests, and, occasionally, other selective investigations. Clinical clues to guide the clinician to suspect such diseases are also provided.",

      "abstract": "Sleepwalking and night terrors have been defined as disorders of arousal (1 ) that occur early in the night and have their onset during stage 3 or 4 sleep (2, 3). During a sleepwalking episode, the individual seems confused, detached, and relatively unresponsive. Night terrors are more dramatic; patients manifest terror and panic, and there is extreme autonomic discharge and vocalization. In both disorders, patients are difficult to arouse, and complete amnesia or minimal recall of the episode is frequent. A genetic component underlies these disorders in that patients often have a family history of sleepwalking, night terrors, or both (4). Sleepwalking and night terrors typically begin in childhood or early adolescence and are usually ‘ ‘outgrown’ ‘ by the end of adolescence, suggesting a delay in CNS maturation (5). When sleepwalking or night terrors have a postpubertal onset or continue into adulthood, however, psychopathology is a more significant causative factor (6, 7). These shared characteristics have led us to propose that sleepwalking and night terrors have a common etiology and are part of the same pathophysiologic spectrum (8). In this paper. we report on febrile illness as a precipitating factor for the onset of sleepwalking or night terrors. To our knowledge. this is the first report establishing this relationship. We have evaluated five children or adolescents who began to sleepwalk or to experience night terrors during or immediately after a febrile illness. The following three case reports illustrate our observations of this phenomenon.",

      "title": "Early Markers for Cerebral Palsy",
      "abstract": "Cerebral palsy (CP) is a term referring to a nonprogressive disease of the brain originating during the antenatal, neonatal, or early postnatal period when brain neuronal connections are still evolving. Secondary effects of spasticity on growth may, however, be progressive. There may be additional disturbances of sensation, perception, cognition, communication, and behavior. Babies who are neurologically abnormal as newborns are at increased risk of neurologic abnormality in later months and years. Being born preterm (born &lt;37 weeks of gestation) or with a very low birth weight (weighing &lt;1500 g/&lt;32 weeks of gestation) or extreme low birth weight (&lt;1000 g/&lt;28 weeks of gestation) is associated with significant motor impairment. Which specific signs in the neonate are of greatest predictive power, what long-term disability these signs predict, and how well they predict it remain unclear? Physician’s major concern is to identify specific risk factors for severe impairment in early infancy so as to predict the developmental outcome of those children that may manifest later on with neurological deficit especially if they have perinatal insult. Parents on the other hand are also concerned about their growing infants, their development, and neurological outcome. Since cerebral palsy is a permanent disorder, early detection of signs of motor impairment is crucial to assist physicians to give close follow-up of those infants and to reassure parents whose children are normal. It has been shown that intervention may be most efficient when the plasticity of the brain is high, and an early detection of brain impairment is therefore crucial. An earlier follow-up and training program can have a positive effect of the motor development of the child with CP, in particular through prevention of limb contractions, and might make a difference in the child’s ability to handle everyday challenges. In addition, an early detection of CP gives the parents more time for adjustment and preparation. Since clinical manifestations of cerebral palsy do not emerge before a child is at least 6 months, the general movement (GM) is considered the most reliable early markers for monitoring of fetal and infant movement. Abnormal General movements and absence of the so-called fidgety movements at 3-5 months post-term carries a high risk of developing cerebral palsy. Beside a high specificity (82–99%) and sensitivity (95–100%), the assessment of the general movements (GMs) is quick, nonintrusive, and easy to acquire.",

      "title": "[Clinical practice guideline. Diagnosis and treatment of insomnia in the elderly].",
      "abstract": "Insomnia is the difficulty to initiate or to maintain sleep. It also has to do with waking up too early at least for a month. A patient with insomnia has daytime consequences such as fatigue, sleepiness, changes in mood, lose of concentration, as well as changes in his social performance and his family relationships, among others. The relationship between this disorder and physical and mental health is important due to the impact that it has on the quality of life and life expectancy of those who suffer from it. Unfortunately, insomnia usually goes unnoticed or untreated, which contributes to the onset or worsening of psychiatric and medical conditions. This exacerbates the problem of insomnia in the elderly people. In relation to the treatment it is recommended: 1) the search and management of secondary causes of insomnia, 2) a non-drug therapy that includes sleep hygiene measures, 3) pharmacotherapy. It is not recommended to start a treatment with a hypnotic drug without rule out medications or diseases that cause or exacerbate insomnia. It is not recommended the use of narcoleptics, melatonin, antihistamines or long half-life benzodiazepines. The consequences include limitations on activities of daily living, loss of functionality, impaired quality of life, increased morbidity and mortality, as well as the worsening of preexisting chronic conditions.El insomnio es la dificultad para conciliar o mantener el sueño; también consiste en despertar demasiado temprano al menos durante un mes. Un paciente con insomnio presenta consecuencias diurnas como fatiga, somnolencia, deterioro de la memoria, cambios en el estado de ánimo, en la concentración, así como en su desempeño social o familiar, entre otros. La asociación de este padecimiento con la salud física y mental es importante debido al impacto que tiene en la calidad y la esperanza de vida de los que lo padecen. Desafortunadamente, el insomnio suele pasar desapercibido o no tratarse, lo cual contribuye al empeoramiento de condiciones médicas y psiquiátricas. Esto se acentúa más en los adultos mayores, grupo por demás vulnerable. En relación con el tratamiento se recomienda aplicar la siguiente combinación: 1) la búsqueda y el manejo de causas secundarias de insomnio, 2) alguna terapia no farmacológica que incluya medidas de higiene del sueño, 3) tratamiento farmacológico. No es recomendable comenzar el tratamiento con un hipnótico sin haber descartado fármacos o enfermedades que provoquen o exacerben este padecimiento. Tampoco se recomienda el uso de neurolépticos, melatonina, antihistamínicos o benzodiacepinas de vida media larga. Las consecuencias incluyen limitación en las actividades de la vida diaria, pérdida de la funcionalidad, deterioro en la calidad de vida, incremento en la morbimortalidad, además del empeoramiento de las condiciones crónicas prexistentes.",

      "abstract": "The presence of depression and cognitive impairments was examined in seventy patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). Forty nine patients of this original cohort were re-examined between three and four years after the first evaluation. While both depressed and non-depressed patients showed a significant decline in cognitive function during the follow up period, intellectual decline was significantly more severe for the depressed group. Depressed patients also showed a faster rate of progression of motor signs (mainly tremor) than the non-depressed group. Patients that died during the follow up period showed significantly more cognitive impairments than patients who were alive at follow up. These findings suggest that either there may be two forms of PD: one with depression and rapid cognitive decline and one without depression and a gradual cognitive decline; or that the mechanisms of cognitive impairment in PD and depression may interact to produce a more rapid evolution in cognitive impairment among PD patients with a previous depression than among patients without a previous depression.",

We report the case of a woman with PD dementia who initially presented with unyielding central neuropathic chest pain and parkinsonism. Diagnostic workup showed no abnormal findings related to her pain. Although her parkinsonism was responsive to dopaminergic medication, her clinical status rapidly deteriorated to dementia with hallucinations and delusions over 2 years. An autopsy was performed following death after 6 years of disease. Pathologic examination revealed diffuse Lewy body pathologies (Braak stage VI), limbic-predominant Alzheimer’s disease pathology, and TAR DNA-binding protein 43 pathologies in the amygdala. The patient was an APOE4 carrier. Multiple pathologies concurrent with the APOE4 allele might be associated with rapid clinical deterioration. Although pathologic substrates for pain remain uncertain, the initial presentation of unusual pain merits further clinicopathological correlation studies.",

It is usually a chronic condition that can be difficult to treat because standard treatment with conventional analgesics does not typically provide effective relief of pain. Patients with neuropathic pain commonly present to primary care professionals, but making a diagnosis may be difficult. Neuropathic pain is usually associated with substantially greater impairment of quality of life compared with other types of chronic pain, and the disorder is a large cost burden on healthcare services. In this review, we provide an overview of published evidence to help clinicians recognise and manage patients with neuropathic pain.\n\nA group of specialists of the International Association for the Study of Pain defines neuropathic pain as “pain arising as a direct consequence of a lesion or disease affecting the somatosensory system.”1 In contrast to inflammatory or nociceptive pain, which is caused by actual tissue damage or potentially tissue damaging stimuli, neuropathic pain is produced either by damage to, or pathological change in, the peripheral or central nervous system, the system that normally signals pain. As such, the term neuropathic pain represents a varying set of symptoms rather than a single diagnosis.\n\nDamage to the somatosensory system can provoke a range of responses; an absence of sensation and pain is probably a more common response than new onset of …",

Early in the disease course, it can be difficult to differentiate PD from other conditions such as essential tremor (ET), multisystem atrophy, and progressive supranuclear palsy. Even with the correct diagnosis, PD has wide variability in disease course, rate of progression, and response to treatment, making an objective marker extremely useful.",

One of the mostly recognized examples is coeliac disease where patients endure the large spectrum of psychopathological symptoms, starting with attention deficit all the way down to the intellectual disability in extreme cases. It has not been fully explained how the pathomechanism of digestive system diseases affects patient's mental health, however one of the hypothesis suggests that it is due to serotonergic or opioid neurotransmission imbalance caused by gluten and gluten metabolites effect on central nervous system. Behavioral changes can also be invoked by liver or pancreatic diseases, which causes life-threatening abnormalities within a brain. It occurs that these abnormalities reflexively exacerbate the symptoms of primary somatic disease and aggravate its course, which worsens prognosis. The dominant mental disease mentioned in this article is depression which because of its effect on a hypothalamuspituitary- adrenal axis and on an autonomic nervous system, not only aggravates the symptoms of inflammatory bowel diseases but may accelerate their onset in genetically predisposed patients. Depression is known to negatively affects patients' ability to function in a society and a quality of their lives. Moreover, as far as children are concerned, the occurrence of digestive system diseases accompanied by mental disorders, may adversely affect their further physical and psychological development, which merely results in worse school performance. All those aspects of mental disorders indicate the desirability of the psychological care for patients with recognized digestive system disease. The psychological assistance should be provided immediately after diagnosis of a primary disease and be continued throughout the whole course of treatment.",

      "abstract": ": Neurological diseases expose individuals to a higher risk of suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior, including completed suicides and suicide attempts. They also represent a paradigmatic arena to study the etiopathogenic mechanisms underlying suicidality because they are emblematic of the heterogeneity and complexity of mutual interrelationships characterizing this issue. On the one hand, neurological diseases imply strictly biological impairments that are postulated to be the basis of vulnerability to suicide or result in the need for treatments for which a suicidal risk has been hypothesized. On the other hand, they question some subjective experiences of neurological patients, up to near existential positions. Often, in fact, they are accompanied by severe hopelessness. The latter may originate in, particularly for the most severe neurological diseases, the absence of curative treatments, unpredictable disease progression that leads to acute relapses or chronicity, a decrease in autonomy or selfidentity, progressive social isolation, a sense of becoming useless, and perception of feeling stigmatized. This may ultimately cause a slip into experiencing an absurd condition. At the confluence of neurobiology and hopelessness, frequent psychiatric comorbidities may play a primary role. To conclude, neurological patients require special attention from clinicians in form of openly verbalizing and exploring the suicidal thematic, inquiring about protective and risk factors, and promptly initiating both a psychopharmacological treatment and, where possible, psychological support.",

      "abstract": "Parkinson’s disease is a relatively common neurodegenerative disorder in clinical practice, and its prevalence is increasing worldwide. It not only causes patients to have movement disorders such as tremors and delayed initiation but also makes them suffer from olfactory disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, insomnia and other symptoms, which imposes a heavy burden on both patients and their families. In recent years, some scholars believe that the gut-brain axis may be the key to revealing the pathogenesis of Parkinson’s disease. The changes in intestinal flora, or bacterial infections and oxidative stress, lead to abnormal aggregation of alpha-synuclein and formation of neurotoxic Lewy bodies, which are transmitted to the central nervous system via the vagus nerve, thus causing Parkinson’s disease. A large number of evidence-based studies have shown that acupuncture is effective in treating motor disorders and non-motor symptoms such as constipation, neuropsychiatric symptoms, and dysphagia symptoms in Parkinson’s disease, also this treatment is safe. However, its mechanism remains unclear. Acupuncture may affect the gut-brain axis and treat PD by improving intestinal flora imbalance, interfering with the expression of alpha-synuclein protecting neurological function, reducing imflammation, and influencing glial cells, etc. Therefore, the aim of this review is to elucidate the pathogenesis of PD from the perspective of neural, immune, and metabolic signaling pathways of the microbiota-gut-brain axis. In addition, this paper integrates the mechanism of acupuncture treatment with the pathogenesis of PD for the first time and to provide potential new strategies for its treatment.",

Depressions are attributed to both psychological and biological reactions. Mania, too, can be precipitated by cerebral and other medical factors. The proportion of psychiatric inpatients who have depressions with melancholic and/or psychotic features is higher among elderly subjects, and this has been linked with white matter lesions and other brain changes that become commoner in old age.

The presence of such symptoms as cognitive dysfunction, psychiatric symptoms (psychosis, depression, anxiety, apathy, and poor impulse control), sensory symptoms (pain, restless leg syndrome, and akathisia), fatigue, and autonomic dysfunction has dominated the literature and led to the development of a nonmotor-unified PD rating scale. The occurrence of nonmotor features has not been as well established or studied in dystonia. While both disorders are due to abnormalities in the basal ganglia, they differ in that PD is neurodegenerative while dystonia is not. This may explain, at least partially, why nonmotor phenomena are less emphasized in dystonia. Nevertheless, it is clear that the basal ganglia govern the development of nonmotor symptoms through connections with sensory cortex, thalamus, limbic structures, and other regions. Although sensory and psychological symptoms are reported, a search of the dystonia literature identifies few, if any, references on dementia, autonomic features, and fatigue. This chapter will review what has been examined with regard to psychiatric symptoms, sleep disorders, pain, and the nonmotor hallmark of dystonia, sensory tricks.",

      "abstract": "La maladie de Parkinson (MP) est la deuxieme affection neurodegenerative la plus frequente apres la maladie d’Alzheimer. Elle se caracterise par un dysfonctionnement du systeme des ganglions de la base, en rapport avec une degenerescence des neurones dopaminergiques de la substance noire compacte. A cote des symptomes moteurs, la MP s’accompagne de troubles cognitifs, en particulier une alteration des capacites de selectivite attentionnelle. Ce deficit attentionnel se traduit par des difficultes a selectionner les informations pertinentes pour la conduite en cours et peut entrainer des troubles cognitifs legers. L’origine des troubles attentionnels reste imprecise : on ignore s'ils resultent d’une defaillance des mecanismes volontaires d’orientation de l’attention ou d'une perturbation des processus automatiques de capture attentionnelle. Le filtrage sensoriel permet de focaliser notre attention grâce a une selection des informations pertinentes pour l’action en cours et une inhibition des informations non pertinentes. Il peut etre explore en neurophysiologie par le paradigme d’inhibition par le prepulse (PPI). Ce dernier correspond a l’attenuation de la reponse motrice et corticale suite a la presentation d’un stimulus sursautant (pulse) lorsque celui-ci est precede de quelques millisecondes d’un stimulus non sursautant (prepulse). Le PPI est influence par l’attention, son amplitude etant majoree lorsque l’attention est portee volontairement sur le prepulse. L’objectif general etait donc de mieux identifier la nature des troubles de la selectivite attentionnelle dans la MP par un paradigme actif de PPI au cours duquel la reponse corticale au pulse est enregistree. Nous faisions l’hypothese que les parkinsoniens presenteraient une inhibition plus faible que les temoins sains. En cas de defaillance de mobilisation volontaire des ressources attentionnelles, l'inhibition de la reponse corticale au pulse devrait etre moins importante lorsque les ressources attentionnelles allouees au traitement du prepulse mettent en jeu la mobilisation volontaire de l’attention. A l’inverse, en cas de defaut de capture attentionnelle, l’inhibition de la reponse serait moins importante lorsque le traitement du prepulse implique les processus automatiques de capture.Pour repondre a cet objectif, nous avons dans un premier temps developpe et valide un paradigme actif de PPI au cours duquel l’effet de la mobilisation volontaire de l’attention et de la capture attentionnelle sur le processus de filtrage sensoriel a ete evalue. Pour ce faire, 26 temoins sains jeunes ont beneficie d’un electroencephalogramme a haute resolution tout en realisant une tâche attentionnelle sur laquelle a ete greffe un paradigme actif de PPI. Nous avons recueilli la reponse corticale evoquee et induite par la presentation du pulse. 16 temoins sains âges, 16 patients parkinsoniens sans trouble cognitif et 16 patients avec troubles cognitifs legers ont beneficie du meme enregistrement au cours de la meme tâche attentionnelle. Chez les temoins sains jeunes, nous avons montre que les processus de mobilisation volontaire de l’attention et de capture attentionnelle modulaient de facon differentielle la reponse evoquee et induite par la presentation du pulse. Au cours du vieillissement, nous avons observe une meilleure sensibilite de la reponse corticale induite, ce qui nous a conduit a choisir ce marqueur cortical pour evaluer le filtrage sensoriel dans la MP. Nos resultats montrent une reduction de l’inhibition de la reponse induite chez les parkinsoniens avec troubles cognitifs legers, confirmant la distractibilite. La MP s’accompagne aussi d’une alteration dans la generation des oscillations corticales dans la bande de frequence theta quand la focalisation de l’attention est engagee.",

      "title": "Dementia and Alzheimer's Disease: What We Know Now",
      "abstract": "Small delays in onset of Alzheimer's Disease are predicted to reduce its global burden, but we need to better understand factors that increase the risk-and methods to reduce it. The clinical syndrome of dementia refers to a pattern of cognitive deficits characterized by impairment in memory and at least one other cognitive domain (e.g., language, executive functions, visuospatial abilities) that is sufficiently severe to impact behavior and interfere with social or occupational functioning (American Psychiatric Association, 2000). Dementia may be progressive, static, or remitting, and its onset and course of symptoms are a function of underlying neuropathology from various causes. For example, dementia because of a neurodegenerative process tends to involve an insidious onset with gradual progressive cognitive impairment. In contrast, dementia from vascular or acquired brain injury tends to involve an abrupt onset of clinical symptoms that may remain static or show stepwise cognitive decline that corresponds to episodes of cerebrovascular accidents. The most common causes of dementia are neuropathologically distinguished on the basis of the presence of beta-amyloid (Aβ) plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (e.g., Alzheimer's Disease); multiple or strategically placed infarctions, ischemic injury, or hemorrhagic lesions (e.g., vascular dementia); cell loss and the deposition of Lewy bodies in sub-cortical, limbic, and neocortical regions (e.g., dementia with Lewy bodies); and prominent frontal and temporal lobar atrophy (frontotemporal dementia). Dementia can also be found in the context of other neurological, infectious, or metabolic conditions, such as Parkinson's Disease, Huntington's Disease, human immunodeficiency virus, or traumatic brain injury. Despite recent advances in amyloid imaging and cerebral spinal fluid analysis, neuropathological changes are often only accurately assessed at autopsy. This makes definitive diagnosis during an individual's lifetime difficult. Effectively differentiating between forms of dementia or normal aging requires reliance on the neuropsychological definition of a specific pattern of cognitive deficits. Epidemiology and Neurobiology of Alzheimer's Disease Alzheimer's Disease is the leading cause of dementia in elders and accounts for 60 percent to 80 percent of all dementia cases. An estimated 5.3 million Americans have Alzheimer's Disease. Reports indicate the disease is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States, and deaths because of Alzheimer's Disease are on the rise, with an increase of 46 percent between 2000 and 2006. Given the advancing age of the baby boom generation, by 2050, 14 million older Americans and 81 million adults worldwide are expected to have the disease (Alzheimer's Association, 2010a). Alzheimer's Disease is an age-related degenerative brain disorder characterized by the abnormal accumulation of extracellular fibrillar amyloid deposits and intra-neuronal neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. These characteristics lead to neuronal atrophy and synapse loss in medial temporal lobe limbic structures that are critical for episodic memory and extend to the association cortices of the frontal, temporal, and parietal lobes with disease progression (Braak and Braak, 1991). Consistent with these widespread neuropathological changes, the primary clinical manifestation of Alzheimer's Disease is a progressive global dementia syndrome that usually begins in later life. It is generally agreed that the pathological cascade of brain changes occurs gradually in Alzheimer's Disease, beginning with the very early accrual of Aβ plaques in the brain, and is followed by a variable lag time after which neuronal dysfunction and neurodegeneration become the leading pathological process (Jack et al., 2010). Although Aβ neuropathology is thought to be causal, clinical symptoms are more closely related to neurofibrillary tangles than amyloid deposition. …",

      "title": "Psychosis in Parkinson’s Disease: a Case Report of Diagnosis and Management",
      "abstract": "Introduction Psychosis is a frequent complication in patients diagnosed with Parkinson’s Disease (PD). Characterized mainly by visual hallucinations and paranoid delusions, it occurs most frequently, but not exclusively, as an adverse effect of antiparkinson medications. Nevertheless, cognitive impairment and dementia, as a frequent feature of PD, needs to be considered for differential diagnosis. Objectives Our main objective is to report a case of PD Psychosis, its diagnosis and management and complement it with a non-systematic review of literature. Methods Patient file consultation and an additional research, based on the key words “Psychosis” and “Parkinson’s Disease”, using Pubmed as database. Results A 53-year-old female, diagnosed with Juvenile Parkinson’s Disease since age 45 and, as expected, polimedicated with antiparkinson medication. Without any relevant psychiatric background, she was admitted to the emergency department for disorganized behaviour, with 2 weeks of evolution. There, it was also possible to determine the presence of auditive hallucinations and persecutory delusions, associated with marked anguish. After exclusion of any underlying cause for this symptomatology, inpatient treatment was proposed and accepted by the patient. In collaboration with the Neurology Department, a gradual reduction and optimization of antiparkinson drugs was conducted, associated with introduction of low doses of antipsychotic drugs, in this case Olanzapine. With this medication adjustments, clinical improvement was accomplished, with eventual fading and cessation of psychotic symptoms. Additionally, an irregularly intake of antiparkinson drugs was considered the most probably cause of this clinical decompensation. Conclusions As present in literature, due to the chronicity and complexity of PD, stopping all antiparkinson drugs is not an option, even when psychotic symptoms, that could be a consequence of these drugs, are present. Therefore, a rigorous evaluation and management are mandatory, including the exclusion of other underlying causes and a careful therapeutic adjustment, with gradual reduction of antiparkinson drugs, addressing an eventual temporal relationship between the beginning of a specific drug and the onset of symptoms, and verification of therapeutic compliance, including an involuntary overdose. In cases of refractory symptoms, and after a risk-benefit assessment, pharmacologic treatment directed at these symptoms, low doses of anti-psychotics, may be necessary.

      "abstract": "The prevalence of overt dementia in 27 studies representing 4,336 Parkinson's disease (PD) patients was 39.9%. The studies reporting the highest incidence of intellectual impairment (69.9%) used psychologic assessment techniques, whereas studies identifying the lowest prevalence of dementia (30.2%) depended on nonstandardized clinical examinations. Neuro-psychologic investigations reveal that PD patients manifest impairment in memory, visuospatial skills, and set aptitude. Language function is largely spared. Intellectual deterioration in PD correlates with age, akinesia, duration, and treatment status. Neuropathologic and neurochemical observations demonstrate that PD is a heterogeneous disorder: the classic subcortical pathology with dopamine deficiency may be complicated by atrophy of nucleus basalis and superimposed cortical cholinergic deficits, and a few patients have the histopathologic hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. Mild intellectual loss occurs with the classic pathology, and the more severe dementia syndromes have cholinergic alterations or Alzheimer's disease. Thus, PD includes several syndromes of intellectual impairment with variable pathologic and neurochemical correlates. ( J Geriatr Psychiatry Neurol 1988;1:24-36).",

Of 1,210 patients with neurodegenerative diseases referred to our institutions from 1999, 488 were diagnosed with PD, 415 with Alzheimer's disease, 162 with DLB, 48 with progressive supranuclear palsy, 48 with multiple system atrophy, and 49 with frontotemporal dementia. Rates of somatoform disorder were considerably higher in DLB (18%) and PD (7.5%) than in any other group (0–2%). Somatoform disorders in PD and DLB were characterized by motor and non-motor patterns with bizarre presentations, and were often accompanied by catatonic signs (41%). In 77%, they preceded PD motor signs by 6–120 months, and in 86%, they were recurrent at follow-up. In 91%, there was preceding or concomitant hypochondriasis. Global cognitive decline was greater in PD with somatoform disorder than without (p < 0.001), comparable to that observed in the DLB group. The phenomenology suggests a blurred boundary between somatoform disorder and psychosis (somatic delusions). The presence of somatoform disorder may identify a subgroup of PD patients with distinctive clinical symptoms, including catatonic features and a poor cognitive outcome.",

      "abstract": "A doença de Parkinson (DP) é uma desordem neurodegenerativa caracterizada clinicamente por tremor, rigidez, acinesia (ou bradicinesia) e instabilidade postural.Patofisiologicamente, a DP é classificada como uma sinucleinopatia associada à perda de neurônios dopaminérgicos na substância negra (SN), mas outros neurônios do tronco encefálico podem estar degenerados na DP, contribuindo não só para as alterações motoras, mas também não motoras observadas.Dentre as alterações não motoras, as alterações respiratórias estão presentes tais como obstrução das vias aéreas superiores, pneumonia e ainda a apnéia obstrutiva do sono uma das principais causas de morte na DP.Os mecanismos que levam à degeneração de neurônios envolvidos no controle respiratório ainda não estão bem esclarecidos, mas dados recentes do nosso laboratório mostraram que no modelo de DP induzido pela injeção no caudado-putâmen (CPu) de 6-hidroxidopamina (6-OHDA), um agente neurotóxico seletivo para células catecolaminérgicas, observou-se intensa redução na frequência respiratória e ventilação basais e induzidas pela ativação do quimiorreflexo central por hipercapnia.Além disso, observou-se também intensa redução do número de neurônios bulbares envolvidos no controle neural da respiração, como os neurônios Phox2b + da região do núcleo retrotrapezóide (RTN), que estão envolvidos com a inspiração e o quimiorreflexo central.Dessa forma, o objetivo do presente trabalho foi investigar se a existência de uma via entre os neurônios da SN e do RTN poderia ser responsável por essa neurodegeneração.Realizamos injeções de traçadores anterógrados e retrógrados na SN e no RTN de ratos para verificar a existência de projeções diretas entre essas regiões, entretanto observamos que não há projeções diretas entre a SN e o RTN, mas há projeções indiretas entre essas duas regiões, utilizando a Substância Cinzenta Periaquedutal (PAG) como região intermediária.Além disso, observamos que no modelo de DP induzido pela injeção bilateral de 6-OHDA no CPu ocorre uma redução no número de varicosidades catecolaminérgicas na PAG e de neurônios que são ativados pelo quimiorreflexo central que se projetam da PAG para o RTN.Nossos experimentos eletrofisiológicos mostraram que a inibição bilateral da PAG pela injeção de muscimol não gera alterações respiratórias basais como ocorre no modelo da DP; entretanto, nesses animais, pudemos também observar, apesar de ser menor do que ocorre com animais submetidos ao modelo da DP, inibição de alterações respiratórias induzidas por hipercapnia.Nossos dados anatômicos mostraram que a comunicação entre os neurônios da SN e do RTN envolve neurônios da PAG e que essa via pode estar reduzida no modelo da DP, o que pode contribuir para a redução de neurônios do RTN; e que a redução neuronal desta via pode alterar",

      "title": "Circadian aspects in the aetiology and pathophysiology of insomnia",
      "abstract": "Summary Because the endogenous circadian pacemaker is a very strong determinant of alertness/sleep propensity across the 24 h period, its mistiming may contribute to symptoms of insomnia (e.g., difficulties initiating sleep and maintaining sleep) and to the development of insomnia disorder. Despite the separation of insomnia and circadian rhythm disorders in diagnostic nosology implying independent pathophysiology, there is considerable evidence of co‐morbidity and interaction between them. Sleep onset insomnia is associated with later timed circadian rhythms and can be treated with morning bright light to shift rhythms to an earlier timing. It is also possible that the causal link may go in both directions and that having a delayed circadian rhythm can result in enough experiences of delayed sleep onset to lead to some conditioned insomnia or insomnia disorder further exacerbating a delayed circadian rhythm. Early morning awakening insomnia is associated with an advanced circadian phase (early timing) and can be treated with evening bright light resulting in a delay of rhythms and an improved ability to sleep later in the morning and to obtain more sleep. There is some evidence suggesting that sleep maintenance insomnia is associated with a blunted amplitude of circadian rhythm that may be treated with increased regularity of sleep and light exposure timing. However, this is an insomnia phenotype that requires considerably more circadian research as well as further insomnia clinical research with the other insomnia phenotypes incorporating circadian timing measures and treatments.",

      "abstract": "Insomnia is the inability to obtain sleep of sufficient length or quality to produce refreshment the following morning. It is not defined by total sleep time per 24 hours. For example, a person who needs only 4 hours of sleep does not have insomnia if he or she is refreshed in the morning after having 4 hours of sleep, whereas someone who needs 10 hours of sleep may have insomnia if he or she does not feel refreshed even after 8 hours of sleep (1). Contrary to popular belief, psychiatric or psychological factors are not the most common causes of insomnia (1). In fact, untreated insomnia, itself, is a risk factor for the subsequent development of clinical depression and psychiatric distress (2).",

      "abstract": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with a high burden of morbidity. Because no diagnostic test exists for PD, clinical knowledge and skill are key to making an early, accurate diagnosis. Diagnostic criteria for PD require at least two of three motor signs: tremor, rigidity, or bradykinesia. Levodopa and the dopamine agonists are considered first-line drug therapy. Recent studies have shown a lower incidence of dyskinesia in patients who began therapy with a dopamine agonist, although levodopa may be better tolerated by patients age 70 or older. Combinations of medications and rehabilitative, alternative, and surgical therapies can often help patients achieve adequate control of PD motor symptoms and maintain a high quality of independent living.",

      "abstract": "The association of movement disorders with structural or functional hepatic disease occurs in three principal scenarios: (1) combined involvement of both organ systems from a single disease entity, (2) nervous system dysfunction resulting from exposure to toxic compounds in the setting of defective hepatic clearance, or (3) hepatic and/or neurological injury secondary to exposure to exogenous drugs or toxins. An important early step in the workup of any patient with combined movement disorders and liver disease is the exclusion of Wilson's disease. Diagnostic delay remains common for this treatable disorder, and this has major implications for patient outcomes. Thereafter, a structured approach integrating variables such as age of onset, tempo of progression, nature and severity of liver involvement, movement disorder phenomenology, exposure to drugs/toxins and laboratory/neuroimaging findings is key to ensuring timely diagnosis and disease-specific therapy. Herein, we provide an overview of disorders which may manifest with a combination of movement disorders and liver disease, structured under the three headings as detailed above. In each section, the most common disorders are discussed, along with important clinical pearls, suggested diagnostic workup, differential diagnoses and where appropriate, treatment considerations.",

      "title": "Μελέτη της εκδήλωσης αγχώδους συμπεριφοράς σε ζωικό μοντέλο Πάρκινσον",
      "abstract": "Οι νευροεκφυλιστικές παθήσεις, είτε κληρονομικές είτε σποραδικές, χαρακτηρίζονται από προοδευτική δυσλειτουργία του νευρικού συστήματος που σχετίζεται με ατροφία εγκεφαλικών περιοχών του μεταχμιακού συστήματος. Η νόσος του Πάρκινσον (PD) αποτελεί μία από τις πιο συχνές νευροεκφυλιστικές παθήσεις του Κ.Ν.Σ με χρόνια και προοδευτικά εξελισσόμενη πορεία κινητικών διαταραχών, που τα τελευταία χρόνια συσχετίζεται με συναισθηματικές και γνωσιακές διαταραχές. Οι διαταραχές της διάθεσης και ιδιαίτερα η κατάθλιψη καθώς και οι αγχώδεις διαταραχές αποτελούν συχνή συν-νοσηρότητα των ασθενών με PD, προτείνοντας ένα κοινό νευροανατομικό υπόβαθρο στο φλοίο-μεταιχμιακό σύστημα. Νευροχημικοί μηχανισμοί που ευθύνονται για τις μη-κινητικές διαταραχές, τις νοητικές και συναισθηματικές λειτουργίες στην PD έχουν συσχετισθεί με μεταβολές νευροδιαβιβαστικών συστημάτων όπως είναι αυτό της σεροτονίνης και της νοραδρεναλίνης. Επίσης, προτείνεται ότι τόσο η φλεγμονώδης αιτιολογία της PD αλλά και η αλλοστατική έκφραση νευροτροφικών παραγόντων εμπλέκονται στην εκδήλωση αγχωδών διαταραχών έπειτα από εκφύλιση των ντοπαμινεργικών νευρώνων της μέλανας ουσίας. Η υπάρχουσα φαρμακευτική αγωγή δεν παρέχει μακροχρόνια αποτελεσματική διαχείρηση των συμπτωμάτων της νόσου και τα τελευταία χρόνια έχει αναδειχθεί η διατροφική αξία φυτοχημικών ουσιών προκειμένου να κατανοηθούν οι μηχανισμοί της πιθανής νευροπροστατευτικής επίδρασης της συμπληρωματικής διατροφής που είναι πλούσια σε φαινολικά συστατικά, συμπεριλαμβανομένης της Κορινθιακής σταφίδας (Vitis vinifera L. var Apyrena). Οι πολυφαινόλες που αποτελούν ομάδα φυτοχημικών παρουσιάζουν πληθώρα ευεργετικών δράσεων για την υγεία. Μεταξύ άλλων επιδεικνύουν αντιοξειδωτικές, αντιφλεγμονώδεις, αγγειοδιασταλτικές και αντιθρομβωτικές ιδιότητες. Συγκεκριμενα στην Κορινθιακή σταφίδα έχουν ταυτοποιηθεί απλές φαινολικές ενώσεις και φλαβονοειδή όπως κερκετίνη, καμπφερόλη, ρεσβερατρόλη και 3-Ο-γλυκοζίτες ανθοκυανιδινών.Στο πλαίσιο της παρούσας Διατριβής, ερευνητικό ερώτημα αποτέλεσαν οι νευροχημικές μεταβολές, ο ρόλος προ-φλεγμονωδών παραγόντων καθώς και η κατανόηση των μηχανισμών της πιθανής νευροπροστατευτικής δράσης της συμπληρωματικής διατροφής πλούσιας σε φαινολικά συστατικά, όπως η Κορινθιακή σταφίδα (Vitis vinifera L. var Apyrena). Για τη διερεύνηση των νευροβιολογικών μηχανισμών που υπογραμμίζουν την εκδήλωση μη-κινητικών διαταραχών στην PD καθώς και τον ρόλο των πολυφαινολών χρησιμοποιήθηκαν ως ζωικό πρότυπο αρσενικοί ενήλικοι Wistar επίμυες. Το ζωικό μοντέλο της PD αναπτύχθηκε σε πειραματικές ομάδες που έλαβαν υποδόρια ενέσεις της νευροτοξίνης ροτενόνη για 28 ημέρες σε συγκέντρωση 2,5 mg/kg. Οι ομάδες παρέμβασης έλαβαν συμπληρωματική διατροφή με Κορινθιακή σταφίδα, ενώ υπήρχαν και οι αντίστοιχες ομάδες ελέγχου (με έκδοχο νευροτοξίνης και ροτενόνης-ζώων) χωρίς την διατροφική παρέμβαση. Η κινητική συμπεριφορά καθώς και η εκφύλιση των ντοπαμινεργικών νευρώνων χαρακτήρισε τον φαινότυπο που ομοιάζει με PD. Στην παρούσα μελέτη επιπλέον διερευνήθηκε η εκδήλωση αγχώδους συμπεριφοράς με δοκιμασίες ανοιχτού πεδίου (Open Field) και υπερυψωμένου λαβυρίνθου σχήματος «+» (Elevated Plus Maze). Παράλληλα πραγματοποιήθηκαν νευροχημικές μελέτες με στόχο τον συσχετισμό της εκφύλισης των ντοπαμινεργικών νευρώνων με τη νοραδρενεργική και σεροτονινεργική διαβίβαση σε εγκεφαλικές περιοχές που εμπλέκονται στον έλεγχο συναισθημάτων και συγκεκριμένα σε αυτές του μεταιχμιακού συστήματος, όπως ο προμετωπιαίος και ο κογχομετωπιαίος φλοιός, ο ιππόκαμπος και ο βασικός και έξω αμυγδαλοειδής πυρήνας. Εξετάστηκαν δείκτες της νοραδρενεργικής διαβίβασης, όπως οι β2 αδρενεργικοί υποδοχείς και της σεροτονεργικής διαβίβασης με επίκεντρο την σεροτονίνη (5-ΗΤ) και τον μεταφορέα της σεροτονίνης (SERT), με μεθόδους ανοσοϊστοχημείας, διπλού ανοσοφθορισμού και Western Blot. Παράλληλα, στα πλαίσια της γλουταμινεργικής διαβίβασης, διερευνήθηκε η αλλαγή στα επίπεδα έκφρασης της NR2B (NMDAε2) υπομονάδας του NMDA υποδοχέα και της μετασυναπτικής πρωτεΐνης PSD95. Σε επόμενο στάδιο πραγματοποιήθηκε μελέτη των επιπέδων έκφρασης του νευροτροφικού παράγοντα BDNF και της προφλεγμονώδους κυτοκίνης IL-1β στις υπό μελέτη περιοχές του φλοιο-μεταιχμιακού κυκλώματος επίμυων που έλαβαν ροτενόνη ή έκδοχο με ή χωρίς συμπληρωματική διατροφή με Κορινθιακή σταφίδα.Σύμφωνα με τα αποτελέσματα της παρούσας Διατριβής, η ντοπαμινεργική δυσλειτουργία στη μελαινοραβδωτή οδό σε πειραματικό ζωικό μοντέλο ροτενόνης συνοδεύτηκε από αγχώδη φαινότυπο που διαπιστώθηκε ότι σχετίζεται με μεταβολές στους β2-ARs, την 5-ΗΤ, τον SERT, τον BDNF και την IL-1β σε περιοχές του φλοιο-μεταιχμιακού συστήματος εγκεφάλου επίμυος. Στην παρούσα μελέτη, η συμπληρωματική διατροφή με Κορινθιακή σταφίδα αποκατέστησε εν μέρει τα κινητικά καθώς επίσης και τα μη κινητικά ελλείμματα. Σε κοινό πλαίσιο, η συμπληρωματική διατροφή με Κορινθιακή σταφίδα αποκατέστησε εν μέρει τις επαγόμενες από τη ροτενόνη αλλαγές στους β2-ARs και διέσωσε εν μέρει την πυκνότητα των κυττάρων 5-ΗΤ+ και BDNF+. Συνολικά με βάση την υπόθεση της εργασίας, της παρούσας Διατριβής προτείνονται ως πιθανοί παθοφυσιολογικοί νευροχημικοί μηχανισμοί στην εκδήλωση αγχωδών συναισθηματικών διαταραχών οι μεταβολές στη σεροτονινεργική διαβίβαση στο φλοίο-μεταιχμικό κύκλωμα και επίσης αναδεικνύεται η μερική «(πολυ)φαινολική νευροπροστασία» σε νευρικά κυκλώματα που ελέγχουν κινητικές και συναισθηματικές λειτουργίες.",
