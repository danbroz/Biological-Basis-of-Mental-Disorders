      "title": "PHILOSOPHY, ADVERTISING MYTHS AND MANAGEMENT",
      "abstract": "Being concerned with current matters, ordinary man is used to have a regular approach on life, by means of efficiency oriented skills. Carried out by worries and hopes, he does not allow himself to breed the taste for speculation. Usually, his horizon of questions regarding man and life is often mistaken for the sphere of immediate needs – in what concerns its level, contents and solutions. Raising questions – when it happens and inasmuch as it happens – appears attached to unusual events (either good or bad) and, most of the time, just inasmuch as these require a certain effort in order to be integrated into what is called habits. Ordinary judgement is in terms of action and utility. The meaning of life is neither obsession, nor a release of passion, since physical and soul energies are oriented towards goals that do not allow somebody to appeal to reflection. Playing with abstract arguments is frightening, distracts from those acts that are experienced as obligations, and this is why it will be avoided, as much as possible. Self preservation instinct works well enough. Man has the taste for relativity; daily activities witness for the weaknesses of humanity and the powers of hazard, shaping his wisdom; life is intuitively taken as a value, and it is worth living even if there are no strong meanings; thus, life is above all ideas describing it. Daily life receives a immediate link between theory and practice, between knowledge and action; we live under the impulse of satisfying needs; this is why choosing goals and means cannot be endlessly suspended in order to make room for deliberative reflection; one makes appeal to already given knowledge and value instruments that have a certified efficiency. This is why daily subjective life oscillates between decisions founded on momentary, passing and inconsistent reasons and decisions determined by rigid grounds, although they seldom conceptually clarified (tradition, habits). Ordinary consciousness behaves like a receptacle: the knowledge of reality – taken as a mirroring of reality by thought and senses – remains at the stage of noticing and uncritical description of some empiric correlations, of factual observations, of some modes of external phenomenal manifestation. Realism that is based on the “logic of senses” combines with the concern for normative aspect of life and action. “Common sense – says Lucian Blaga – is due to some ideas acquired by human spirit in time, by means of living together with the others. Within the individual, it is a",

It sounds appealing. Being untethered allows Hugh to focus on internal states and develop a kind of connoisseurship of his positionality. Anthropologists have shown enthusiasm for illness narratives. Thinking in terms of untethering places a value on freedom conceived of as personal liberty and calls attention to how freedom might be pursued. Hugh rejected the psychiatrist's range of medication, and his life continued. He is excited, feels super-fortunate. He is in the right place at last, but also he is making good social connections and is trusted. Psychosis can look like performance art. A person that can be tethered or untethered is necessarily distinguishable from their environment.",

      "title": "Reply to “a non-paternalistic value theory for occupational therapy: a response to Dige”",
      "abstract": "Sandman makes it sound as if I am the one who defends a contentious theory whereas the alternatives, i.e. hedonistic or desire-fulfilment theories, are more uncontroversial or “minimal”. I fail to see this because I find it much more straightforward to say that certain elements of a human life, e.g. accomplishment, personal relationships, and understanding, have a direct or intrinsic value and therefore are something that it is good to enjoy or desire whereas others, e.g. monotony, isolation, and confusion, have a direct or intrinsic disvalue and therefore are something that is not worth enjoying or desiring. It is not entirely clear whether Sandman wants to challenge the view that activity is intrinsically better than passivity or the view that specific types of activities (e.g. those involving personal relationships, understanding, and accomplishment) are objectively better than others in the sense that they constitute genuine, intrinsic values. The first point is easily misunderstood. The claim that activity is intrinsically good does not imply an ideal of hyperactivity and extreme sports. Sandman’s examples of rather monotonous and mindless activities (playing Tetris and “ordering, reordering and ordering again a set of differently coloured pens”) are interesting only if they more or less take up all the person’s time. Most of us use a considerable amount of time on activities like that (for better or worse). It becomes a professional (OT) challenge only if the person seems incapable of enjoying or desiring anything else and I have a hard time imagining a responsible occupational therapist who would accept a life of total passivity (taking part in no challenging or social or self-involving activities whatsoever) as a possible ideal life. The second point is a matter of considerable philosophical controversy and it would be overly ambitious to try to settle it definitively. Hence, apart from what I have said in the original article, I will just offer an example for consideration. Imagine a child in an elementary school who exclaims: “But I do not want to come to understand maths or grammar or anything else at all and I do not want to interact with you teachers and the other children and I do not want to make school work my own accomplishment!” That would certainly be a pedagogic challenge but I think it would take a lot more than this to make it a challenge to our belief in these values. On the contrary, it would simply be unprofessional if the schoolteachers reassessed their mission and value commitments to the effect that they gave up on teaching maths to those who did not want it, allowed the antisocial children to be left alone, and so on. Quite another but very important consideration is that we sometimes have to settle for something short of the ideal. Imagine for example that the child suffers from social phobia and gets extremely anxious when",

This alienation establishes compulsive behaviors that deprive the subject of free will. Management taken literally leads to the temptation of excess and the passionate amplification of problems. The “bad habits” of a manager reverberate. Psychoanalysis as a practice or knowledge can act here as an antidote by bringing a fair measure of passion. The activity of reflection builds symbolic landmarks between which the metaphorical narrative myth about making and leading others can be organized. The conduct of men is not only organizational and methodological: it is spiritual. Self-knowledge that avoids recourse to defensive or aggressive mechanisms allows us to develop emotional accommodations, connecting practice and ethics without confusing them in “justastructure” (Seve 1966). We must all suspect ourselves and each other of hidden temptations disguised with legitimate reasons. Ethics is the unconditional authorization to become “someone else” in a space where knowledge, skill, initiative, and respect for shared values mean that freedom and limits must constantly be defined. But let no one be fooled: the best is confiscated by the discrete, efficient, and united castes who firmly hold the titles and means. Management serves them. Unconditionally.",

      "abstract": "In religion, as in every other subject of human reasoning, much depends upon the order in which we dispose our inquiries. A man who takes up a system of divinity with a previous opinion, that either every part must be true, or the whole false, approaches the discussion with great disadvantage. No other system, which is founded upon moral evidence, would bear to be treated in the same manner. Nevertheless, in a certain degree, we are all introduced to our religious studies under this prejudication. And it cannot be avoided. The weakness of the human judgement in the early part of youth, yet its extreme susceptibility of impression, renders it necessary to furnish it with some opinions, and with some principles or other. Or indeed, without much express care, or much endeavour for this purpose, the tendency of the mind of man to assimilate itself to the habits of thinking and speaking which prevail around him, produces the same effect. That indifferency and suspense, that waiting and equilibrium of the judgement, which some require in religious matters, and which some would wish to be aimed at in the conduct of education, are impossible to be preserved. They are not given to the condition of human life.",

      "title": "Power Motivation in Sidonius Apollinaris, Eugippius, and Nonnus",
      "abstract": "Power can be thought of as the capacity to produce effects, consciously and unconsciously intended, on the behaviour and feelings of others. Power motivation arises when an individual experiences a need that can only be fulfilled by inducing appropriate behaviour in others. Ideals of service are an important means for taming or socializing power, rendering it more acceptable. This often means that a drive for power is marked by talk of duty and responsibility. The ranks of teachers, psychologists, clergymen, journalists, and urban planners contain above average numbers of people with a high power motivation. It can be hard to distinguish legitimate and necessary leadership from coercion and domination, for the latter may not be perceived as such by followers. People vary enormously in the degree to which they are prepared to challenge existing structures and norms to gain power, and they vary in their response to the attainment of power. The mere status of their position may be sufficient for some: power is not vigorously or selfishly exercised, nor is it conspicuously displayed. There may be present a fear of power, i.e., a fear of abusing it, which is defended against by maintaining that power is not one's own but a gift of grace to be used for the benefit of others. Charismatic or messianic leaders often make this claim. They are able to enhance the self-esteem of followers by providing a potent object of identification, and they lead by making their followers feel powerful rather than by commanding them. Identifying with any winner or hero, whether sporting, religious, or political, provides a vicarious experience of power. The need for power, therefore, is not only about a drive to influence others. Alcohol consumption induces a feeling of power. For those frustrated in their hopes of gaining real power, it offers a substitute, as do sex and violent behaviour. A drive for personalized power may be accompanied by high alcohol consumption, low inhibition of impulses, and, more so than socialized power, it has a present orientation, a moment-by-moment quality that has to be constantly reaffirmed. Gambling offers opportunities to impress and to win in the short run. A socialized power drive is characterized by low alcohol consumption and high inhibition, and may be advertized by dietary and sexual asceticism.",

      "abstract": "What is autonomy, given that it is undermined or nullified by a variety of circumstances—coercion, brainwashing, some forms of manipulation, oppressive socialization, posthypnotic suggestion, and the like? I argue that the usual answer, self-government, fails once we recognize that selves can govern in spite of defects that prevent the realization of an agent's deepest personal ideals and values. Definitions of autonomy in terms of self-realization are also rejected. A close examination of the inhibitory effects of oppressive socialization reveals the centrality of the idea of liberation to autonomy or, more specifically, authenticity. The liberation is to engage with features of the world relevant to the agent's desires, values, and commitments. It is a transfer of control from alien forces from without or within to the world. An agent's authenticity is guaranteed once causal pathways, linking the agent's goals with relevant features of the world, are operating in the service of an informed and competent agent. It is argued that sudden radical conversions and (hypothetical) total value reorientations, induced neurologically, do not inhibit the autonomy of a self, but rather involve the creation of new selves.",

      "abstract": "the history of man's struggle against death and deprivation. A man must live before he can act, either for himself or to help others. Therefore, 'unless each duly cares for himself, his care for others is ended by death; and if each thus dies, there remain no others to be cared for.'1 To the extent that a man is rational he will first address himself to his own survival and only then attempt to satisfy his less immediate needs, an attempt that usually exhausts his time and energy without providing as great a return as he would like. Even if he is fortunate and his resources are not exhausted, he may decide to save them to put things away for 'a rainy day.' In the former situation there is nothing to distribute to those in need; in the latter, kindliness ('helpfulness towards someone in need, not in return for anything, nor for the advantage of the helper himself2) does not seem to be consistent with a man's long-range self-interest. In either case, kindliness is not perceived as rational. To sum up : since kindliness is not rational in the face of death, and seldom rational when death is not imminent, it appears to follow that kindliness is generally not a rational act. At least four classic ethical traditions, Judaism, Christianity, Kantianism, and Utilitarianism (especially Mill's theory), reject this argument. Each maintains that there is a duty to help others and that this duty, the duty of beneficence, when properly understood is not irrational.",

Causes and occasions are of the most various types, difficult to compare between persons, often moulded by the currents of the day, inherited ways of thinking, experiences and environment. Querulants are personalities, who, after colliding with the legal system and having had their own claims dismissed, suffer from an often chief and irremediable feeling of being victim of an injustice. They cannot understand that, what is in due form valid can, when, scrutinized with the greatest sense of justice and practical common sense, impress upon someone as injustice. The submission to the unattainable, the parting from hopes, expectations and claims do not materialize. The step by step stiffening readiness for action can be confined to the lawsuit matter, it comes however about, that it extends to further spheres of life. Escalations occur in particular then, when the authorities course of action, courts of justice and opponents are felt as tyrants or mortal threat. A person deriving a meaning from his entire life or events, which he interprets for himself, makes his relations to the community and Law fragile [90]. Are presented within the framework of differential diagnostic distinctions, manifestations of querulous behaviour among abnormal personalities, neurotic disorders and schizophrenic psychoses under psychiatric aspects. Brought into sharper focus are the psychogenic psychoses, which became manifest in the USA, GUS and scandinavian countries in connection with serious querulous evolutions. Hints to decision of the supreme court and forensic psychiatric expert opinion conclude the article.",

A particular misapprehension concerning friendship and love also warrants some attention, however. Many people suppose that even if the egoist can be kind, charitable, or generous on certain occasions, his egoism undermines his capacity to enjoy deeper, more rewarding personal relationships. After all, isn't the egoist committed to always putting himself first? And as a consequence, won't he be too wrapped up in himself to care about others – or at least, to care in the way that a true friend would? Without a less calculated commitment to another person's well-being, the soul of love and friendship seems unavailable to him. Egoists cannot be authentic friends or lovers, the suspicion is, since, qua egoists, they can value others only instrumentally.",

They have limited themselves into a small line of close friends. The narcissistic personality disorder can cause great difficulties in interpersonal relationships, especially marriage. This is because narcissists are always self-righteousness and the world should revolve around them. Narcissistic people are not able to love others. They do not understand love (they constantly ridicule others and humiliate their subordinates). However, they take advantage of concept of love in order to deceive and trap others but it is all theatrics and role-playing. People with dependent personality disorder typically rely on others for their needs. They expect that others accept responsibility for most important issues in life. They lack self-confidence. They feel intense dissatisfaction whenever they feel lonely, even for a short time. Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder is presented by discipline-oriented perfectionism and psychological control. The individuals with this disorder try to be in control of everything through careful attention to norms, details, lists and programs. They are extremely careful, repeat every task for several times, and pay special attention to details and frequently resolve probable mistakes. They do not pay attention to the fact that other people feel upset in case of delays and discomfort that arises from their excessive behavior.",

      "abstract": "Altruism is unselfish concern for other people’s happiness, welfare, and well-being. If an individual’s behavior or motives are altruistic, one shows concern for the happiness and welfare of other people rather than just for oneself. One is selfless and not selfish. To express it in another way, altruism is the renunciation of the self and an exclusive concern and care for the welfare of others. It is a traditional virtue in many cultures and a core aspect of various religious traditions. Giving alms to the poor is often considered an altruistic action in many cultures and religions. Altruism is also a motivation to provide a value to a party who must be anyone but the self, while duty and loyalty are somewhat moral obligation of a person toward a specific individual (God or a king) or collective body (a government). Some individuals may feel both altruism and duty, while others may not. Pure altruism is an instinctively “giving” value without any regard to rewards or the benefits that recognition of the giving may bring. The term altruism may also refer to an ethical doctrine that claims that individuals are morally obliged to benefit others. Used in this sense, it is the opposite of egoism.",

      "title": "NATURE FEARS EMPTINESS : AN ANALYTICAL READING OF EMOTIONAL EMPTINESS",
      "abstract": "Nature does things well, but sometimes it takes crooked paths... In psychoanalysis, the role of the psychoanalyst, as of any other therapist, is not only to set clinical goals, to understand the psychic work of the patient and to accompany him in his self-discovery. Above all, it is supposed to manage the internal conflicts of the suffering subject. To do this, he seeks to shed light on his unconscious journey and detect the vagaries of his psychic functioning. He try to act on his commitment, motivation and adherence to the values of the society in which he lives, without hindering his subjectivity. This human mission is often complex because individuals are free and autonomous beings. They should not be treated as if they were instruments of any society. These people are also specific: they each have a particular childhood and social background. They have a different history and heritage, do not have the same ambitions, the same responsibilities, or the same dreams or professional goals. In short, individuals are very heterogeneous. This increases the difficulty of supporting them therapeutically and requires helping them to flourish despite their traumas. However, the trauma and the emotional emptiness it causes, added to the pain it causes, create a strong internal uncertainty in the patient. The psychoanalyst must endeavour to take this into account. The effectiveness of the intervention depends on the psychoanalyst's ability to understand and analyze the patient's behaviour in light of the psychological evidence. In this article, we will look at clinical cases representing essential facets of human behavior as well as the theories behind them. The approach is quintessentially Freudian. These conceptual foundations provide the clinic with levers for action to heal people. We analyze human behavior according to the social environment with which it interacts and which will cause its pathology to evolve... thus forging one's own nature.",

Everest), and that this entitled me to a bigger than usual share of social resources, whether in the form of money (travel grants) or leisure (paid leave from work). Fur ther suppose that I was deeply committed to this project, both intellectu ally and emotionally, and found it difficult to imagine life without it; the project was not merely something I chose but something I was—it partly constituted my identity. Under such circumstances, should I be given any special treatment? Specifically, should I be entitled to a greater than normal share of social resources to support my project? On one standard reading of liberalism, I should not be. Insofar as lib eralism is committed to neutrality toward (justice-respecting) concep tions of the good life, my share of resources should not vary with my plan of life and the particular ends and preferences associated with it, as liberal principles of justice properly take no notice of such variations— be they across persons or with respect to a single person across time— but rather focus on the development and exercise of those common moral powers (viz., rationality and reasonableness) that characterize free and equal citizens.1 In brief, I should adjust my plan of life to accord with my just share of social resources, not the other way around.

They perform their duties without any interior spirit, without relish and without fruit. These are in danger of mortal sin. Sometimes they are in a state of sin without realizing it, because they never seriously enter into themselves and their examination of conscience is extremely superficial. In this state of inattention innumerable objects pass through their mind each day, their heart is carried away and seems intoxicated with the turmoil of exterior matters; it is ceaselessly deceived by the illusions of nature and the devil, and it blindly follows their impulses.",

      "abstract": "&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;Drug (chemical) dependency (the excessive, maladaptive, or addictive use of drugs for no medical purposes&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;despite social, psychological, and physical problems that may arise from such use) is a widespread phenomenon. He (or she) loses freedom of choice. Because of a deep emotional and physical need of addicts to get a drug, their basic activity is inclined to supply &amp;amp;ldquo;chosen&amp;amp;rdquo; substance. Repeating use of substance and its effects, affect their health and interpersonal&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;relationships. Addict denies that. His (or her) possibility to recognize it is limited or ruined. Incorrect pattern of life persists.&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;Cognition of real facts about substance evidently does not protect enough from addiction. In this work effectiveness of a&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;specific, emotional approach in the therapy of addiction has been analyzed. Dependent is faced with another emotion,&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;supposing competitive to those of consuming &amp;amp;ldquo;chosen&amp;amp;rdquo; substance it is. It is expected that strong emotion could activate&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;available, but unattended cognitive contents. Experimental confirmation of working hypothesis is based on emotional&amp;lt;br /&amp;gt;approach to alcohol-dependents. They have been faced with an emotional (literal and /or painted) message of anonym child in the connection with children&amp;#039;s heavy firsthand experiences of alcoholism in the family. Facing consequences, marks and products of dependence (firsthand experienced children&amp;#039;s desperation), experiencing strong enough emotional answer, empathy with other child, alcoholic recognizes desperation of his own related. Faced those experiences, he recognizes their own parental role in their family as negative role. Skilled psychiatrist can use that empathy as significant therapeutic factor. This empathy makes dependent able to overcome fear of changes and face the necessity to change their pattern of life. Most of them, without any further explanations have been turned into insight of addiction and oriented toward the therapy and rehabilitation. Results encourage practicing physician to apply this approach, first of all in the initiation of the therapy (realizing contacts, insight into disease) and later in the psychotherapy of any kind of chemical dependence. The key task of the therapist could be to find out specific, strong enough emotion that could be in certain case competitive to those of pleasure connected to the misuse of substance and a strong challenge to initiate cognitive processes and to change executive behaviour.&amp;amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;",

Generosity involves giving to others, who must be there to receive; moderation involves the appropriate relation, in action, to objects (food, drink, sexual partners) who can fail to be present, either altogether or in the appropriate way. Even intellectual contemplation requires the presence of suitable objects for thought. But this condition, as Plato saw, would rarely, if ever, fail to be met on account of contingencies of circumstance. For something can be an object of thought whether it is physically present or not; as long as there is a universe there will be many things to contemplate everywhere; and, finally, as Aristotle adds, thought can be its own object.",

But unlike learning some other physical operations (those which require skill, like playing the piano, cooking, sewing, or driving a car) the notion of excellence or expertise cannot be applied unmodified to the performance of ritualized action; for ritualization itself tends to undermine the link between the purposes for which an action is performed and the form the action takes. In performing an act in ritualized form, as a ritual act, you perform it as you do, and not some other way, just because it is so prescribed, and not because it makes sense to you to do so, or because you have reasons for doing so. You have reasons only for ‘enacting the ritual’, and whatever those purposes may be, the way to ‘get it right’ as a physical act remains the same. Nevertheless, the relation between purposes and ritualized action is not altogether straightforward.",

This duty is a personal moral duty, not a \"societal\" duty, and thus, it in no way implies that others may demand that it be exercised. It is literally a duty to let death come, not a more general duty to die that encompasses active measures to ensure death. A person can owe this duty not only to close family and loved ones when they are heavily burdened, but in the right circumstances also to more distant persons, even to \"society\"; the fundamental reason is fairness to others in the society or insurance pool, given one's own evaluative preferences about trade-offs involving expensive, low-chance-of-benefit care. This personal moral duty to die does not extend to incompetent patients, at least not in any literal sense. The duty to die also does not jeopardize the marital vow, \"for better or worse, in sickness and in health\"; the creative and mutual relationship envisioned in a marital promise does not bar people from ever coming to think that they may be obligated to accept death because of effects on a spouse. Finally, although this duty is rooted in sensitivity to considerations of quality of life, it need not threaten the \"special\" value of individual life and lifesaving.",

They rarely seek to place the other social disciplines in relation to their own.

History takes so free an amplitude that these others become angles of incidence to its main highroad. It is presumptively concerned with the concrete reality, the wholeness of things, while these others attach to abstractions such as law and government and economics and morals.

      "abstract": "The interest in children's activities is constantly growing. Understanding the structure and meaning of these activities is the king's road to better educational approaches. When a child is engaged in any activity—painting, singing, building, make-believe, experimenting, exploring or whatever—there is an easily recognizable surface quality to his doings. His activities have a certain style which may reflect the child's physical or social surroundings. They are executed according to the child's skill and competence and are dependent to a greater or lesser degree on the equipment, tools, materials or utensils a child may use. This surface quality of children's activities varies according to his or her social, ethnic, economic and personal living conditions. But beyond this surface quality of activities there seems to exist a hidden, deep set of constraining rules of activities. It may even be possible to speak of a set of rules, a \"Grammar of Activity.\" These constraints seem to be universal and independent of the ethnic, social or economic backgrounds of the children but based on innate human systems such as the nervous, muscular and others. Our Study Centre for Children's Activities has for a few years observed, recorded and analyzed various activities of kindergarten children who came from different strata of the Israeli population: Jewish and Arab, city and rural, well-to-do and deprived, Kibbutz children and new immigrants.",

Rarely does it signify possibility for him as an existing person, mainly concerned with making sense of his own life-world. Rarely does it promise occasions for ordering the materials of that world, for imposing \"configurations\"1 by means of experiences and perspectives made available for personally conducted cognitive action. Sartre says that \"knowing is a moment of praxis,\" opening into \"what has not yet been.\"2 Preoccupied with priorities, purposes, programs of \"intended learning\"3 and intended (or unintended) manipulation, we pay too little attention to the individual in quest of his own future, bent on surpassing what is merely \"given,\" on breaking through the everyday. We are still too prone to dichotomize: to think of \"disciplines\" or \"public traditions\" or \"accumulated wisdom\" or \"common culture\" (individualization despite) as objectively existent, external to the knower-there to be discovered, mastered, learned.",

      "title": "Prosocial primates: selfish and unselfish motivations",
      "abstract": "Non-human primates are marked by well-developed prosocial and cooperative tendencies as reflected in the way they support each other in fights, hunt together, share food and console victims of aggression. The proximate motivation behind such behaviour is not to be confused with the ultimate reasons for its evolution. Even if a behaviour is ultimately self-serving, the motivation behind it may be genuinely unselfish. A sharp distinction needs to be drawn, therefore, between (i) altruistic and cooperative behaviour with knowable benefits to the actor, which may lead actors aware of these benefits to seek them by acting cooperatively or altruistically and (ii) altruistic behaviour that offers the actor no knowable rewards. The latter is the case if return benefits occur too unpredictably, too distantly in time or are of an indirect nature, such as increased inclusive fitness. The second category of behaviour can be explained only by assuming an altruistic impulse, which—as in humans—may be born from empathy with the recipient's need, pain or distress. Empathy, a proximate mechanism for prosocial behaviour that makes one individual share another's emotional state, is biased the way one would predict from evolutionary theories of cooperation (i.e. by kinship, social closeness and reciprocation). There is increasing evidence in non-human primates (and other mammals) for this proximate mechanism as well as for the unselfish, spontaneous nature of the resulting prosocial tendencies. This paper further reviews observational and experimental evidence for the reciprocity mechanisms that underlie cooperation among non-relatives, for inequity aversion as a constraint on cooperation and on the way defection is dealt with.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Altruism is action taken out of concern for others for their own sake. Benevolence is such concern. Altruism does not require self‐sacrifice, although it generally has more moral worth when it does than when it does not. Altruism can bring about satisfaction in the agent. But such satisfaction is seldom the motive for engaging in beneficent action, and when it is, it is not a case of altruism at all. An altruist may fail to bring about benefit to the other, but built into altruism is a concern to discern the other's good, not merely to act on what one (perhaps mistakenly) takes to be her good. As humans, we have reason to care not only that other people's well‐being is enhanced, but also, about the motives for which people engage in actions that bring that result about, even though sometimes those motives are difficult to discern.",

      "abstract": "Trust is diverse both in value and location. As a relational good, it calls attention to the attributes of truster and trusted. It may be understood as a precondition of human cooperation and a distinct policy available in specific circumstances. Trust may be inspired by the speaker or the speech, by character or action; as a feature of public institutions whose rules are open to alteration, trust may be construed as an artifact, a device that human beings can control and adjust to changing needs and demands. Trust may be a conditional value, justifying praise only on specific occasions, or it may express an unqualified trustworthiness signifying fidelity or mutual faithfulness. Love, an exclusive loyalty or affection, may make trust blind; equally, trust can attract trust in return. Hobbes takes an uncompromising view of these ambiguities and equivocations. To the man who thinks himself confident of the trustworthiness of others, he asks “what opinion he has of his fellow-subjects, when he rides armed; of his fellow citizens, when he locks his doors; and of his children, and servants, when he locks his chests. Does he not there as much accuse mankind by his actions, as I do by my words?”",

The reason is that poststructuralism is not a way of doing things?administration or anything else. Rather, it is an account of the ways things are done, an account that says things are not done accord ing to clear and determinate rules or abstract moral values or procedural norms or any other master narrative or metanarrative. Poststructuralism tells us things are done according to measures and aspirations that emerge in the course of everyday activity with its shifting senses of goals, dangers, opportunities, rewards, and punishments. The norms that seem compelling to those engaged in everyday activity are not introduced prior to it; they ac quire their force and attractiveness and even their very shape whenever some one or some group wishes to see some thing happen and looks around for a banner to march under or a mantra to invoke, in the hope that others will rally to it and help bring about a desired outcome. There is no point in trying to sort things out in advance, for it is only in the situation that you will know what you want (Do I want to awaken the faculty or do I want to distract it?), and once you know what you want, what you then de cide to do will depend heavily on the history of the institution, the re sources at your command, the calculation of short-term and long-term",

      "title": "Autonomy, Diminished Life, and the Threshold for Use",
      "abstract": "Normative ethical theories today place enormous stress upon autonomy or agency and treat it as of the utmost significance to the value of human life. Some theorists understand agency as referring to personhood or to moral personality; some take it to involve such things as rationality and action upon reasons, self-awareness, self-critical control of one's desires, the application of norms to conduct, and deliberative choice. Some take it to be about making one's own decisions (in the important affairs of life) and directing one's life or about constructing a life of value for oneself or about adopting and living out a life plan or rational plan of action. On all these views, the effect is to set up agents or autonomous beings as a special or privileged class, against which the lives of nonautonomous beings – such as infants, young children, the irreversibly comatose or those in a permanently vegetative state, those suffering from senile dementia, the severely mentally enfeebled, some of the brain damaged, and animals – are assessed and valued. So privileged is this class that all kinds of notions are invented or assumed – such things as impaired autonomy, potential autonomy, interrupted capacity, unrealized capacity, trusteeship, and proxy agency come to mind – by which to try to squeeze as many beings as possible into it. The fear, obviously, is that, if some human being falls outside the privileged class, the protections that normally extend to one morally may possibly be in doubt.",

      "abstract": "There are a number of ways in which a person can share the guilt of another's wrongdoing. He might advise it, command it or consent to it. He might provoke it, praise it, flatter the wrongdoer, or conceal the wrong. He might stay silent when there is a clear duty to denounce the wrong or its perpetrator; or he might positively defend the wrong done. Finally, he might actively participate or co-operate in the wrongdoing. These various activities, apart from co-operation, typically occur before or after the commission of the wrong itself, only provocation being essentially before the fact. As such they fall into the categories of seduction or comfort, seduction being essentially pre-commission and comfort post-commission. In seduction (mutatis mutandis for comfort), the seducer typically leads another into doing wrong who has not definitely made up his mind. He does not assist in the commission, but he leads to its occurring. If the principal (as I will call the one who commits the wrong) has made up his mind, actions which might otherwise amount to seduction are best characterized as amounting to scandal, since they do not lead to wrong but reinforce the principal in his wrongful intent or provide to third parties a bad example since they connote approval of the principal's action. Closely related to the concept of seduction is that of solicitation, though perhaps these are best thought of as two aspects of the same kind of activity.",

It is a matter of experience that the sense of understanding other people's actions draws continually on familiar and subjective elements by which we attribute to others states of mind, desire, motive and purpose that we can recognise in ourselves, or feel we could. They help to make these other people's actions intelligible. We impute understanding of the purpose or feelings of the actors to them. It is often implicit and intrinsic in the verbs or words we use to describe human behaviour (e.g. ‘announce’, ‘give’, ‘feed’, ‘welcome’, ‘answer’, ‘punish’). This is generally so in the description of human behaviour, whatever the writer and his purpose – novelist, historian, anthropologist, journalist, psychologist or philosopher. Description and interpretation of human behaviour are often bound together. Wholly objective descriptions of human behaviour (and ‘pure’ descriptions of social actions a fortiori) are very hard to provide. We do not register human behaviour in a simple objective fashion but we continually seek to recognise and translate it as we perceive it into terms of understanding if we can. We do this without thinking in everyday life; many words we use to think or speak about human behaviour imply such understanding willy-nilly. But it is also a matter of everyday experience that we sometimes find other people's actions hard to understand. The effort of attempting to and failing makes by contrast the interpretative element, which is usually present but implicit, more explicit.",

Or else, he sees the patient's means of striving, the inordinately great or miniscule amount of energy he expends in adaptation, his emotionally inappropriate tone of behavior, or the character of his relationship with other people to be somehow wrong.

And we blame ourselves both for things over which we exerted agential control (e.g., our voluntary acts) and for things over which we lacked such control (e.g., our desires, beliefs, and intentions). I argue that, despite this manifest diversity in our blaming practices, it's possible to provide a comprehensive account of blame. Indeed, I propose a set of necessary and sufficient conditions that aims to specify blame's extension in terms of its constitution as opposed to its function.

Altruistic behaviours may be influenced, for example, by personal concerns for the well-being and interests of others that fit into a broader framework of values. We use an online experiment to explore how donors (pure altruists, warm-glow givers and impure altruists) differ in their structure of values, and whether their prosocial behaviours are guided by specific sets of values and motivations. We find that donors give great importance to the relationship with others, and they identify themselves with the norms and attitude of a community, responding to the values of tradition, conformity, benevolence and universalism. On the contrary, non-donors do not seem to have this kind of values reference and, therefore, are not inclined to make a donation. Furthermore, we find that impure altruists wish to achieve self-enhancement objectives through altruistic behaviour, as pure warm-glow givers do, but, at the same time, they make a donation because it represents a genuine altruistic act, similarly to pure altruists.

It is on this account of the last consequence to regulate these images by the standard of nature and the general good; otherwise the imagination, by heightening some objects beyond their real excellence and beauty, or by representing others in a more odious or terrible shape than they deserve, may of course engage us in pursuits utterly inconsistent with the laws of the moral order.",

When an entity has moral status, I may not act toward it in any way I please, disregarding its well-being, preferences, or continued existence. I owe some moral obligations to that entity itself. As a moral agent, I must care to some degree about what it wants or needs, or simply what it is; this imposes some limitations on how I may act toward it. This is importantly different from having obligations in relation to some entity (e.g., my neighbor's house) that are actually owed to some other entity (i.e., my neighbor). It is the being to whom duties are owed that has moral status. Moral status is also importantly different from moral goodness; persons' intentional conformity to moral principles might be one of the characteristics that enhances their moral status, relative to persons who routinely act immorally and to beings who are incapable of moral action, but being worthy of consideration in others' moral reasoning is quite distinct conceptually from acting morally oneself.",

It is a function of so many variables: age, experiences, present environment, current reading, current physical state are some of them. As for the ways of life that may thus present themselves at different times as each uniquely satisfactory, there can be no doubt about their variety and opposition. The ideas of self-obliterating devotion to duty or to the service of others; of personal honour and magnanimity; of asceticism, contemplation, retreat; of action, dominance and power; of the cultivation of “an exquisite sense of the luxurious”; of simple human solidarity and co-operative endeavour; of a refined complexity of social existence; of a constantly maintained and renewed affinity with natural things—any of these ideas, and a great many others too, may form the core and substance of a personal ideal.",

Sexual misfits experience frustration in relation to their sexuality due to a misfit between 1) the physical and social practices that might constitute a sexuality, 2) the language that might be involved in accomplishing those practices or in reflecting on them, and 3) the categories (both practical and theoretical) that structure the social world and provide it with intelligibility. Sexuality is understood to be both one sociological variable that we use to identify ourselves and others, and the effect of a cloud of other sociological variables. Misfits are people who discover that they don't belong to the class that they have been taken (by themselves or by others) to belong to, because it happens that some criteria that nobody had ever mentioned (or would ever think to mention) has not been satisfied, or because they either lack an essential secondary property or possess a disqualifying one. The absence or presence of such a hidden or secondary property may not even be apparent until a certain event or interaction occurs, until a certain context emerges, or until a certain situation arises.",

In other times, the self-abnegation is all-encompassing; for example, this happens to victims of brainwashing. An agent in such a position can completely fail to understand herself or be understood as having a self. This can arise from internal and external forces. After describing the features of self-abnegation, Wieland concludes by considering whether the self-abnegated person is owed respect. Should a person be treated as if her reasons and narratives were her own even though they are derived from the will of another?

Whether he asks for counsel and information regarding his everyday needs or, far beyond any practical considerations, strives for insight, whether his concern is with the first or the last questions, he does only what he cannot leave undone. He can inquire into things ; he can question himself ; he can direct his questions to others or be interrogated by them ; he can run away from perplexing situations or turn his inquisitiveness to the uncovering of problems. In so doing, he only demonstrates and fulfills a basic mode of human existence. When he attempts to evade painful questions, to withdraw from « re-sponsibility », questions follow and pursue him even into sleep. They emerge from his past ; they threaten him from the future ; they haunt him in the present. Questions themselves never disappear, because questioning never ceases. Although particular questions can be transmitted to others and accepted by them as their own, the act of questioning cannot be taught. Nor does it require a teacher. The first question arises early in the life of every healthy child, from the very roots of its existence. We are able to ask single questions because we are questioning beings at our very core.

      "title": "Edytorial: Samotność a kreacja",
      "abstract": "Ladies and Gentlemen, Reflecting on a possible positive dimension of loneliness in the context of creation, it is necessary to consider the ethical aspect. Being lonely should be understood as being separated, ‘self being’, without others or next to them. Why does an individual decide to be separated? A positive aspect of loneliness must be considered as a person’s independent decision. Being lonely against one’s will cannot be considered as a self-imposed act, as a positive dimension of loneliness. History, literature and religion provide numerous examples of creative and positive dimensions of loneliness, of being alone. However, loneliness in these examples means being lonely for a cause. Being lonely for a cause can be analysed within the ethical aspect. Sacrifice, devotion can also be considered here. On the other hand, contemporary transformations call for viewing loneliness from yet another perspective. Maybe it should be re-evaluated. Being lonely may not result from ‘bad luck’, wrong choices or a desire to sacrifice oneself, but from commonsensical calculations. I am alone because it is more convenient, more practical, it allows me to focus on my goals only. Modern societies do not require forming couples nor joining communities because one is a part of a huge web and may cooperate with others to obtain a particular aim without the necessity to abandon ‘one’s oneness’, one’s separation from others. Maybe such ‘oneness’ should be used as the term describing the contemporary world, in which being in a lasting relationship can be perceived as a nuisance, because it does not permit to form various co-operations in order to achieve various goals. The durability of being together, abandoning one’s distinctiveness may be perceived as something more and more anachronic. Even the traditional attitude to family life may undergo erosion. A futuristic vision of defining one’s share in being together may become a frequent occurrence. For example, who are full-time wives and husbands? Maybe, taking into account cultural and social transformations, it necessary to redefine the identity of marriage, of being a wife, a husband a parent. ‘Oneness’ in relation to a family life is only one aspect of transformations taking place nowadays. Loneliness can take various forms. New media, through which we get to know other people, can also become the source of alienation. Contacts obtained and maintained through them do not seem to be inconvenient in any way – one can always give them up. Zygmunt Bauman draws attention to a limited number of active relations, which does not exceed 150 persons . Thus, everyone can create his ‘own primal village’ with lively relations. This village is not geographically and spatially restricted, and its centrer is ‘me’. ‘Oneness’ will be the result of contemporary civilisation, in which relations are defined by subject’s creation. Everyone can create their own village and their own ethical standards resulting from an adopted philosophy of life. This issue of ‘Horizons of Education’ is devoted to multidimensional analysis of loneliness in the context of creation. Here the readers can find reflection on its psychological, philosophical, educational and semantic aspects. The issue opens with an article written by Beata Balogova and Martin Lacný. It deals with loneliness in the positive context of contemporary person’s social life and considers the meaning of life. The authors analyse experiencing difficult life situations resulting in post-traumatic stress. The experience of such stress offers to an individual a higher quality of life with greater resilience, the result of which is a new dimension of life, a new meaning of life. The articles written by Wieslaw Wojcik and Marek Rembierz also seem interesting: they focus on loneliness in intellectual activities, which require a lot of intellectual effort. Intellectual effort flourishes on loneliness, requires unlimited time, uses it up but gives joy in return. Loneliness of a creator, a genius can yield wonderful fruit. Janusz Miąso discusses the issue of interpersonal communication in the context of loneliness. According to him, at the beginning there is no loneliness but intrapersonal communication, which transform loneliness into a desire for interpersonal communication. Experiencing another human being leads back to one’s inside, where one experiences, enriches and enhances a desire to turn to others becoming permanently more creative. Marek Studenski writes about loneliness with reference to the life of priests and consecrated people. He believes that experiencing loneliness in a creative way is a chance but also a source of problems which might be difficult to overcome. Difficulties faced by priests or monks are often completely different from the ones imagined by those preparing for such life. The necessity to face situations which must be accepted and experienced after the formation period reveal the validity of the decision taken. Bozena Sieradzka-Baziur analyses a semantic dimension of the concept of loneliness. She points at three thematic categories: social contacts, emotions and the number and quantity. Language users assign various, unlimited in number, language signs to those three categories. It results from the fact that languages are alive, they develop and undergo changes together with their users. In her considerations on loneliness, Joanna Sztuka presents volunteering as an active form of adaptation to old age and the strategy of coping with this period of human life. She points at the fact that from a pedagogical perspective, the elderly can and should constitute an important link of the social capital. Thematic considerations on loneliness in this issue of ‘Horizons of Educations’ end with the article written by Justyna Kusztal. We strongly recommend those highly interesting reflections on creative aspects of loneliness. The authors from various academic centres in Poland and abroad have contributed material which is definitely worth thinking over. It should be noticed that loneliness is also closely connected with ethical considerations, as the essence of ethical struggle is to reveal the art of life.",

      "title": "Supererogatory Actions and Their Moral Value",
      "abstract": "In early'90s, Gilles Lipovetsky announced twilight in a desperately seeking welfare, comfort and achieving intimist, materialistic happiness; values of sacrifice being, in this context, all muted. This trend has given rise to Postmoralist society which Lipovetsky claims that stepping out beyond realm of duty, (these societies) does hold without recognizing any authority, but according to a weak and minimal ethic, without obligation and sanction.1The societies that have accepted and have structured their activities according to principles of minimalist ethics, and based on dynamics of subjective rights, have had to adopt a new paradigm, capable, at an ethical and moral level to address and solve problems that societies face: terrorist attacks, natural disaster, famine. Actions required by extreme circumstances2 transcend duty, moral values, good, right, bad get other meanings, and their assessment cannot have as model usual rational structures. In such circumstances, emergence of of (acting on altruistic spirit, placing welfare of others above their own well beyond boundaries of what duty states), imposes itself, and cultivates it and recognizes its merit. The terms holy or holiness, referring to action, as they are used by supererogatory acts3 theories has purely moral sense, without any religious implications. The moral evaluation criteria of terms and intended to be used in moral contexts is reduced, according to Urmson, to two dimensions: personal and actionable. The morality of supererogation manifested at first level is attributed to person who carries out duty in a context where inclinations, desires, and self-interest would determine most of people to do it, and actionable perspective, self-control, self-mastery become essential. The her o overcomes self-preservation instinct, terror-and acts under self-control in a context where most people are gripped by fear. These actions go beyond moral duty and obligation. From an ethical perspective, to act correctly means you do help those facts which are considered to be wrong, and most of ethical standards have a negative-they appear therefore under prohibitions as not to While followers that promote a closed ethical system4, see actions from a clearly dichotomous perspective, these being just right or wrong, and requirement that every man over his lifetime, to always choose lesser evil. The condition of and Hero from point of view of normative theories, is either related to'the voluntary assumption of positions and functions that require these virtues for proper performance of duties or to looking for higher purposes in a manner that is conform to justice, but that exceeds requirements of obligation and duty. As such, morality of supererogation those of saint and hero, do contradict norms of law (right) and of righteousness (justice) rather self voluntarily adopts specific purposes of these principles, going beyond5. The supererogatory actions are related only to this class of actions that would include only saints and heroes. From a broader perspective, supererogatory actions (because focus is more on action and on individual traits, motives, intentions or emotions) become optional or non-binding acts, completely different than acts falling under duty, they transcend duty because agent made more than duty, which requires him or involves what to do. With these features, David Heyd believes that the supererogatory acts have special value: they are morally good and praiseworthy6. Actions with moral value, appraisal, non-mandatory, optional, voluntary undetermined by universal rules and which do jeopardize lives of those who perform them fall into category of (unqualified supererogation)7. …",

      "abstract": "Donor implies a donation, and the paradigm of donation is a conscious act of giving. Giving, after all, is not a legal or even moral duty, but a good thing for good people to do. If, then, donating organs for transplant is beyond the call of even moral, much less legal, duty, of course society should leave it to individuals to make private, personal decisions about whether to donate. Besides people's language about donation, another immediate conceptual barrier to thinking in terms of a moral duty to contribute is that they do not think everyone ought to donate their organs. There are those who religiously or conscientiously object, for example. Transplantable organs often confer huge benefits on their recipients, and unless one has religious or ethical objections against contribution, contributing is a very easy thing to do in terms of time, effort, life plans, and effects on one's other duties.",

This last factor is perhaps the most important of all: the presence of mind to orchestrate both one's own mental resources and habits, and the affordances of the outside world, in a way that optimises their ability to mesh with themselves and with each other.

      "abstract": "Abstract The classifying subjects who classify the properties and practices of others, or their own, are also classifiable objects which classify themselves (in the eyes of others) by appropriating practices and properties that are already classified (as vulgar or distinguished, high or low, heavy or light etc.—in other words, in the last analysis, as popular or bourgeois) according to their probable distribution between groups that are themselves classified. The most classifying and best classified of these properties are, of course, those which are overtly designated to function as signs of distinction or marks of infamy, stigmata, especially the names and titles expressing class membership whose intersection defines social identity at any given time—the name of a nation, a region, an ethnic group, a family name, the name of an occupation, an educational qualification, honorific titles and so on. Those who classify themselves or others, by appropriating or classifying practices or properties that are classified and classifying, cannot be unaware that, through distinctive objects or practices in which their ‘powers’ are expressed and which, being appropriated by and appropriate to classes, classify those who appropriate them, they classify themselves in the eyes of other classifying (but also classifiable) subjects, endowed with classificatory schemes analogous to those which enable them more or less adequately to anticipate their own classification.",

      "abstract": "Anxiety, unlike fear, which is strongly object-related, accompanies man all his life. This anxious condition appears especially then, when danger is imminent, also in the case of being severely ill. Anxiety and hope, even in people severely ill, do not exclude each other. Human life for many and perhaps for all is a race with time. The anxiety not being able to realize enough in a given time often is the reason for a busy and restless activity. Man often suffers from anxiety of other human beings. As ever an individual may live, it always owes something to others. Accordingly, the doctor or other helpers never are able to behave totally in the way as the patient expects and the patient cannot act as the helper truly would like it. Man experiences anxiety, however, also then, when he recognizes to remain in debts towards himself and, in the view of religion, towards a task given by God. Yet, man suffers anxiety not only because of his confrontation with death but also with life and the responsibilities which he has to take over when growing up in society. The struggle for existence described by Darwin, a result of anxiety, seems to be lost for the patient knowing he or she is severely ill, and he/she is therefore upset against a destiny which threatens to exclude him/her from the community of healthy people and perhaps soon from the living persons. Anxiety always turns also around the existence in the group.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

      "title": "Deleuze on Habit",
      "abstract": "Deleuze on Habit Brian O'Keeffe Habits hook us into our sense of self-consistency: we sense life's pattern as our habits stabilize time's flux into predictable routine. To have habits is to set down a multiplicity of little anchors into that flux, each habit constituting a continuum of behavior persisting over time. Of course, too much routine can be a bad thing. But a life with no habits is no life at all, or else it is a fickle existence, unmoored and mercurial. A person without habits sticks at nothing. On the matter of habit, then, it is all about getting the balance right. In The Gay Science, Nietzsche writes: Brief habits.—I love brief habits and consider them an invaluable means for getting to know many things and states down to the bottom of their sweetnesses and bitternesses; my nature is designed entirely for brief habits […]. Enduring habits, however, I hate, and feel as if a tyrant has come near me and the air around me is thickening when events take a shape that seems inevitably to produce enduring habits—for instance, owing to an official position, constant relations with the same people, a permanent residence, or uniquely good health. Yes, at the very bottom of my soul I am grateful to all my misery and illnesses and whatever is imperfect in me because they provide a hundred back doors through which I can escape enduring habits. To me the most intolerable, the truly terrible, would of course be a life entirely without habits, a life that continually demanded improvisation—that would be my exile and my Siberia. (167–68) Brevity is the soul of habit. Enduring habits only lead to a clotted, coagulated existence made up of burdensome obligation. Consider his resistance to the obligation to be always in good health: imagine the impudent pleasure one gets in telling the doc—always concerned to impose the doctrine of \"wellness\"—that one has a pack-a-day smoking habit, and then sitting back to enjoy the scolding lecture with indifference. Illness, a hacking smoker's cough, or a slightly enlarged liver, can be escape routes from the irritating officiousness of the sane, the well, and the well-meaning. Yet, if Nietzsche detests enduring habits, what is worse is having no habits. A life that never settled into any routine at all would be a skittish kind of life, so mercurial and improvised—wholly new at each instant—it would be like living in the gulag. Siberia, for Nietzsche, is a sort of nowhere place of utter inconstancy. [End Page 71] Elsewhere in philosophy, opinions on the matter of habit are sometimes mixed, sometimes starkly pro or con. For Kant, thinking of the moral subject, obeying the law out of mere habit is dangerously lax. Habitual action is too passive, whereas real obedience requires a strenuous act of will. Habitual thinking edges into thoughtlessness, whereas moral action requires a moment of lucid deliberation, particularly vis-à-vis one's moral maxims. For the Aristotle of the Nichomachean Ethics, on the other hand, \"virtue of character is a result of habituation\" (23). The virtuous person acquires good character in various ways—it helps to have upstanding role-models and congenial circumstances for the flowering of goodness, but one also needs opportunities to practice and gain experience so that doing good will feel second nature. \"The person who is to be good must be nobly brought up and habituated,\" Aristotle writes, \"and then spend his life engaged in good pursuits\" (201). Morality offers an initial sense of the importance of habit to philosophy, but gaining any greater purchase on the topic is hampered by the sheer mystery of habit. How do they begin and take hold? How are we aware of having habits? To answer such questions entails tolerating a messy blurring of the neat dichotomies and oppositions that conventionally shape philosophical enquiry. One problem is the extent to which a habit is both involuntary and voluntary, since while having a habit seems to induce a certain passivity, the will nonetheless exerts itself—the smoker actively motivates himself to reach for another cigarette. When the will is involved, to some...",

Moreover, they will each manifestly want others to conform to such beneficial norms and so each may aspire without fear of contradiction to speak for all in regulating another, whether in educating them, in enjoining conformity, or in correcting offenders. This will give the demands of their social norms a categorical, if still overrideable status. With those norms manifest—and their acceptance by everyone also manifest—they will each be disposed to commit to conforming and upholding those norms: to bet on themselves to do so, at risk of not being able to excuse a failure by invoking a misleading mind or a changed mind. Indeed, they will be committed to this line just by acquiescing in the expectations of others. Among the attitudes to which they will commit in this active or virtual way is the intention to obey and uphold relevant norms: in effect, to value universal conformity in a decisive way. In that case, they will treat the desiderata that explain the commitment as impartial values. And as they may recognize and commit to such values, so they may do so with more personal or sectional values as well.",

      "abstract": "In discussing the extent of personal agency at the end of Chapter 7, I raised the issue of unconscious action. It is not at all unusual for us to see people doing something that they appear to be completely unaware of. By this I don't just mean that they might be doing things that are just outside the focus of their consciousness, like twitching or tapping their feet. We always exhibit behaviour that we are not conscious of in this sense. This sort of 'preconscious' behaviour is not controversial (Freud, 1957). But it may be that I think they are purposefully and subtly putting me in a difficult position, irritating me or making me feel guilty. If challenged, they would strenuously deny what I think they're doing, disavowing it as a purposeful action. Now it could be that it's just me who is being oversensitive. Perhaps I often think other people are trying to irritate me or make me feel guilty — it's a characteristic of my construing and not a feature of their personality. There is always a danger of confusing what we read into or project onto other people with what is really their property.KeywordsCausal PowerInternalise HomophobiaCartesian DualismObject Relation TheoristUnconscious MindThese keywords were added by machine and not by the authors.

The findings and cross-cultural examples explored here contrast with other work in the field where such experiences are described, but insufficiently analysed, as common, folk, invisible or implicit religion. Scholars in the study of religion are often ill-equipped with appropriate concepts and terminology, mainly because they often seek to classify such experiences into different realms, such as sacred/profane or this world/other world. Those divisions do not seem to be significant, if they are apparent at all, to the informants who experience such phenomena. The majority of those experiences occur through bereavement, where belief narratives describing the experience of ‘sensing’ deceased relatives suggest a self-conscious desire and performative strategy to continue their belongings.Many people do not need religion or God to mediate those experiences, prompting the author to analyse the experiences as sensual, emotional, cognitive, self-mediated, and performative, produced in specific social contexts and explained with reference to longings for belongings. They are frequently supported by collective, social interpretations. In illustrating how informants experienced transcendent, non-material feelings and sensations in their ‘here and now’, transcendence is relocated to a non-spatial, temporal, social realm. That shift is made possible by ‘believing through bereaving’, supported by collective memory and desires for continuing relationships.",

Care recipients are typically people who could not flourish without it, such as the very young or ill. Another meaning of 'care' is that it is a motivation based on concern for someone or something outside of oneself. There is a general sense that 'care activities' are of highest quality when accompanied by, and motivated by, authentic emotional commitments, or 'caring feelings'.1How does caring figure into economic life? From the viewpoint of orthodox neoclassical economics, it does not figure in at all. From this viewpoint, economics is centrally defined around the topics of (i) markets in which the goods and services are exchanged for money and (ii) the choice behavior of the rational, autonomous, self-interested agents thought to populate these markets. 'Economic man' then, is imagined as a creature who neither needs care nor has any responsibility or motivation to provide it. The model of the economy that, in theory, is created by these creatures is often taken as an accurate portrayal of real-world capitalism and a simple description of a heartlessness that is presumed to be of its essence. As a result, over the centuries, many supporters for a more caring economy have called for the dismantling of individualist capitalism in favor of a more solidaristic state socialism and/or local, nonprofit familial and community systems of cooperation and sharing.",

As for intelligence, this was not defined by the esoteric knowledge you possessed any more than wealth was defined by the money you had in the bank or the amount of rice in your granary. Rather, it was expressed in the adroitness with which you engaged with others – the way you greeted or cooperated with them, the way you performed your duties and met your obligations.

Any rational person understands that in a pluralist society, we do have desires that seem odd or even incomprehensible to others.

A person who first and foremost desires to indulge in hedonistic pleasures is seen with dismay by his neighbor for whom physical pleasures denote abstinence and strongest possible self-discipline.

Most frequently, the term refers to Sexual abstinence or abstention from alcohol or food. The practice can arise from religious prohibitions or practical considerations. Abstinence has diverse forms. Commonly it refers to a temporary or partial abstinence from food, as in fasting. Because the regimen is intended to be a conscious act, freely chosen to enhance life, abstinence is sometimes distinguished from the psychological mechanism of repression. The latter is an unconscious state, having unhealthy consequences. Freud termed the channeling of sexual energies into other more culturally or socially acceptable activities through “sublimation”. Abstinence may also arise from an ascetic element, present in most faiths, or from a subjective need for spiritual discipline. In its religious context, abstinence is meant to elevate the believer beyond the normal life",

Although pleasure does not interfere with need, it brings about a good feeling, while the need seems to be embodied in our nature as we cannot live without it and now and then we make them merge to combine feelings with reason. Offering is an act without expectation for reward, although the benefits occur after a while, being both material (reward) and especially immaterial, a service or a gesture of gratefulness. We offer when we love, we give because we need to establish moral and social values for our peers to perceive the approach, understanding, tolerance and solidarity.",

The one thing they do not do is read and write.

The priorities can be different, even alternative in their context and opposite in their sense; eternal and temporary; truth and false; real and illusory; clear and subconscious or rational ones. The religion does not exist without the human factor, it has lost its sense, context, role, display, etc. The community without religion has never occurred. Each person and each community appeals to a religious source. A religion in its intrinsic sense is an embodiment of some axiological knowledge, search for a transcendental phenomenon. The religious approach to the moral values contains the deep considering of life sense independently of a person realization sphere. To conclude, while considering the specific features of the modern youth religious values, the two main factors can be named that influence on their functioning: spontaneity and rationality. A person has always been in their interaction. This is the core of a personal existential choice, a man has a real right for freedom, existence, and obtains an opportunity to understand the responsibility for the self existence through internal law, the law of conscience.",

In Gemeinschaft they stay together in spite of everything that separates them; in Gesellschaft they remain separate in spite of everything that unites them. As a result, there are no activities taking place which are derived from an a priori and pre-determined unity and which therefore express the will and spirit of this unity through any individual who performs them. Nothing happens in Gesellschaft that is more important for the individual's wider group than it is for himself. On the contrary, everyone is out for himself alone and living in a state of tension against everyone else. The various spheres of power and activity are sharply demarcated, so that everyone resists contact with others and excludes them from his own spheres, regarding any such overtures as hostile. Such a negative attitude is the normal and basic way in which these power-conscious people relate to one another, and it is characteristic of Gesellschaft at any given moment in time. Nobody wants to do anything for anyone else, nobody wants to yield or give anything unless he gets something in return that he regards as at least an equal trade-off.",

The chief and most expensive commodity that money is laid out in purchasing, is respect. Money, like other things, is worth no more than it will fetch.

Peculiar aspect of complexity in projects is that a project is what different people see, and their attitudes change in time. Using planning in a defensive way, the project is debased; the project, squeezed on the plane surface, considered as a predetermination of the future, is liberated from uncertainty. When a project is conceived in the light of planning control, when a project is divided into an initial phase of planning and a second phase of realization, the project manager is first of all considered the person responsible for its execution. The project manager enjoys high technical consideration but appears somehow subordinate, compared with the figure of the fully recognized manager.",

Long deliberation may be followed by an impulse to act that flies in the face of one's own good counsel. Despite doubts of this nature, most people who reflect on the matter have a strong desire to be in charge of themselves, however difficult the task and uncertain the outcome. Self, in western society, has become a central idea. It is the focus of an endless number of popular and academic books. Since the seventeenth century, it has become attached as a prefix to an increasing number of words, such as self-esteem. In sum, self is central to our beliefs, and in this important area of our life we do not want to be led – by authority, dogma, or false prophets.

      "abstract": "Social psychologists invented the concept of prosocial behavior to characterize a range of voluntary actions that benefit the welfare of others. Because prosocial behavior is socially defined, its specific nature may differ across societies or by situations. For example, the widespread norm, “Thou shall not kill,” does not apply on the battlefield where killing may be rewarded with praise and medals. Prosocial behavior is consistent with social norms and provides a convenient antonym for antisocial behavior, or non‐normative behaviors such as crime and most forms of aggression. Helping is a prosocial subtype and refers to any behavior that has positive consequences for another. The helper's motivation may be altruistic or egoistic. Altruism is a special form of helping. The altruist is motivated by the ultimate goal of improving another's well‐being regardless of possible personal costs. Although the altruist may garner rewards in the act of helping, this does not preclude the altruistic intent. In contrast, egoistic responses are self‐serving and motivated by the desire to improve one's own welfare. The connection between altruism and prosocial behavior varies. Prosocial behavior will not always be altruistically motivated, and altruistic motivation will not always generate prosocial behavior (Batson 1991).",

We can say that happiness to some extent can compensate for the lack of certain goods. A person is unhappy not when one does not know his center and boundaries, but when one cannot have power over them. Happiness is not rather in the retention of goods, but in the free possession of them. This rule is emphasized by rare exceptions from it: these include a person's dependence on the good of communication with spiritually close ones, relatives, loved ones, friends. Happiness is not a constant escape, but rather a constant learning of happiness. Person uses his / her eccentricity to find his / her new center each time, not to lose it or lose faith in it. Changing one's borders is also not unlimited and completely arbitrary. All this must also be learned, because the loss of goods is also bitter, especially if involuntary or, moreover, against our will, and the loss of some goods is the loss of our very life – organic and / or spiritual. Happiness is in the unity of eccentricity and centripetal of some personality: in the constant rejection of the unchanging center and boundaries of one's personality and at the same time in the constant search and new discoveries that partially reaffirm this center and boundaries – but as a result of one's own choice.

However, he also addresses the cultural and historic forms of validity based on the perspectives of his own interests, reasons and wishes, ambitions, religious and ideological commitments. In this sense, not only does the social world constitute the main scene of our actions but also the locus of resistance. These days of highly social complexity and growing cultural interaction mobilize different identification and differentiation processes. In extraordinary situations of change, such as migration for reasons of work or study, or reasons of political or allegedly religious exile, a reformulation of socio-cultural spaces occurs, which is coupled with a rupture of social connections of support and belonging. This refers to a lifestyle under a “transience” status, which may last, in certain cases, all life long. The “place of roots” fails and the subject ends up feeling a stranger even in its own spaces. In this sense, the foreigner’s right (xenos) to hospitality resides precisely in not being considered the absolute other, the barbarian, the savage who is absolutely excluded and heterogeneous, but in being someone whose identity should be guaranteed. Upon answering this requirement, the foreigner undertakes responsibility before the law and before its hosts: the foreigner becomes “a subject of rights”.",

The traumatic events overwhelm the ordinary human adaptations to life and generally involve threats to life or bodily integrity, confront human beings with the extremities of helplessness and terror, and evoke the response of catastrophe. The vulnerable self-structure of traumatized individuals is evident in the following ways: (a) difficulties in self-regulation (self-esteem maintenance, lower tolerance levels, and the sense of self-discontinuity and personal agency), (b) appearance of the clinical symptomatology (frequent upsurges of anxiety/fear, depression, and specific fears or phobias regarding the external world or one's own bodily integrity), and (c) reliance on primitive or less-developed forms of the self-object relatedness. Severe trauma may lead to de-centering of the self (self-at-worst), loss of groundlessness and a sense of sameness, self-discontinuity and ego-fragility, leaving scars on the one's 'inner agency' of the psyche, fragmentation of the ego-identity resulting in proneness to dissociation.",

To insist that aesthetic experience is a central issue in any discussion of the humanities may be restating what is obvious to everyone; but I honestly fear that too often what is commonly accepted becomes commonplace and is thus neglected. Moreover, scholars frequently hesitate to discuss matters that seem to verge on the irrational, and we generally recognize that the experience of a work of art is almost totally subjective. The quality of this event, its intensity and duration, are difficult to measure or to compare with analogous moments?the feeling of fulfillment of a chemist as he perfects a complex synthetic compound, the ex ultation of a victorious athlete, or the mood of a fisherman sitting silently along the banks of a river at dusk. I am concerned here less with the problems and insights of the creative artist, whether ancient or modern, and more with the reaction of his audience who are far more numerous. The mo ment when any man among them becomes enthralled with a work of art, the moment of true and private revelation, becomes one of the important events of his biography?the night he at tended a performance of Shaw's Saint Joan or The Marriage of Figaro, the afternoon he walked about the Church of St. Pierre 837",

      "abstract": "Abstract I argue that athletes should neither be taken as role models nor present themselves as such. Indeed, they should resist any attempt to take them as such on the grounds that seeing athletes (or other celebrities) as role models abrogates the existential and ethical responsibilities of both parties. Whether one takes on the role of being a model to others or whether one chooses to model one’s own behaviour on that of another, except in respect of the development of technical skill, one engages in bad faith and fails to act in an existentially ethical way. To this end, I consider the inclination to influence and admiration, as well as self‐respect, agency, motivation, and envy. I argue that while celebrity sportspersons and similar others do not have duties that others do not have just by virtue of their notoriety alone, they may have situational responsibilities commensurate with their social reach. More importantly, however, since social influence is not a transformation of inert matter, there are also responsibilities belonging to their audiences, those who merely observe and those who choose to imitate",

Feelings of compassion call for an 'imaginative dwelling' on the particular circumstances of another. We will not have this experience or it will be misdirected if we do not treat the other person as an identifiable individual; someone with a particular history; someone with particular needs and desires. Compassion, in short, calls for particularity. The administration of the law, in contrast, calls for abstraction, it encourages an approach which treats people in general terms. Law's emphasis is on generality and the sameness of people; for justice demands that rights and obligations be applied equally, often irrespective of particular circumstances. That judges settle disputes according to law (and not moral principles or feelings) and that bureaucrats administer without affection or illwill are regulative ideals of our legal and administrative structures.",

      "abstract": "Dignity highlights value, honesty, moral merits, the degree of appreciation as well as a person’s rank in society. In Christian teaching, human dignity is regarded as a divine gift that whatever the circumstances in which the person lives, takes God’s given Model as an example of life and attitude. Term form of dignity in a society can also be understood as the autonomy and freedom of thought as well as the behavior of an individual. Human dignity is very much linked to the sense of honor because a worthy man always inspires respect both to himself and to those around him, to his values and the values of others.1 Thus, the term dignity means the quality to be worthy, prestige, moral authority, dignified attitude, greatness and self–esteem. When talking about the esteem granted to a person we must understand the respect and consideration for human worth and dignity of each person in itself. Dignity cannot be represented without honesty, responsibility, fairness, courage, duty, honesty, etc., values which it integrates. The disregard of the human being, regardless of the reasons from which it springs, brings damages to human dignity, and as such must be regarded as inhuman and reprehensible acts. Human dignity requires the credit or trust that should be given to each person.  KEY WORDS: worth, dignity, human condition, humanistic conceptions, virtue, honesty, respect, responsibility, moral authority.",

T2: God is an omniscient, wholly good being who is omnipotent in the sense that he has (sovereign, providential) control over all existent states of affairs. Why this is so is quite obvious. If T1 is denied, it is difficult to make sense of the standard Christian belief that God can justifiably discipline human agents when they perform actions which violate his commands — i.e., it is difficult to make sense of the basic Christian concepts of sin and punishment. T2 is equally important. If it is denied, it is difficult to make sense of such standard Christian beliefs as (1) God is in control of the significant aspects of our lives, (2) God will bring about his desired goals regardless of the action of human agents, and (3) God is capable of responding in a positive manner to any petitionary prayer that is in keeping with his will.",

      "title": "Dominant Cultural Attitudes in Manu’a*",
      "abstract": "Chiefly concerned then with their social pattern, the Samoans have time for little else. Pondering upon the exigencies of ordered society, they take small interest in the world of the supernatural, nor are they puzzled and perplexed by the world of natural phenomena. The wavering line which divides the animate from the inanimate, the personal from the impersonal, borders their field of attention instead of threading its way among their preoccupations. For an interest in the intractability of material, the unaccountable tendency of wood to split or gardens to languish, they have substituted an interest in the personnel of carpentering or gardening parties. It is not that they have a clearer knowledge of the properties of material things than the Maori, who must perform long rituals to remove the sacredness from a tree which they wish to cut down. Occasional particular tapus, explicit beliefs in some animate phenomenon, attest to their typical untrained confusion. But their all inclusive social formula gives them no acceptable basis of interest in the mysterious properties of material things or natural phenomena. As the development of a human personality may be expressed in terms of choices made between many interests in an effort to bring all parts of one's character within one coherent picture, so a culture like Samoa may be envisaged also. A diffuse cultural equipment which drew from attitudes 247widely distributed in the Pacific has been reshaped to an individual people's emphasis. White civilization, on coming in contact with a primitive people, may teach them that material things must not be regarded animistically or that their gods are false. So the adult's world takes the varied conceptions of the child, pooh-poohs its rituals, ridicules its tapus and insists upon an acceptance of the findings of science. But without definite pedagogic discipline, many children will make some of these selections for themselves in terms of their own temperaments; one child will spend all his strength striving to control the world by means of formulas; another will devote himself to a careful investigation of the properties of material things or the principles of mechanics; a third will throw all his energies in establishing social rapport with his fellows. So human societies, left to themselves, will select parts of their heritage for elaboration, and the original choice will gain in impetus from generation to generation until a coherent individual culture has been developed. A strong religious interest, a premium upon aberrant individual gifts, a permission to love without social sanction and give without stint to that which is loved; all these would disturb the nice balance of Samoan society and so are outlawed. Samoa may be said to have a formal social personality, to be a devotee of a careful observance of all the decreed amenities.",

      "abstract": "It is argued that a link prevails between the phenomenology of externality present in classical liberal theory and the state of mind known as schizophrenia. To escape the social reality of possessive individualism, especially the conception of consequences, ends, habits, routine, the schizophrenic individual ‘withdraws’ or regresses into a psychic universe that contains a dimension unrelated to the consciousness and values of externality: the pursuit of wealth and things, the calculated regard of the other as an instrument for enriching the self. The schizophrenic is incapable of adapting his ‘ego’ to the necessities of the social environment; he cannot defend himself in ‘conventional’ or ‘normal’ ways from the demands of living in a social milieu where the expectations and judgments of others impose intolerable pressures on consciousness. Instead the individual undergoing the painful process of withdrawal constructs a set of psychic defenses that from the standpoint of the external world appear to be ‘strange’, ‘odd’, ‘bizarre’, or ‘demented’. The ‘mode of Being’ of the schizophrenic has nothing in common with the life‐style of the acquisitive, status‐conscious society. Some consideration is given to the political implications and meaning of the schizophrenic's withdrawal.",

      "abstract": "Every individual is not automatically able to realize his desires, but humans are forbidden to forget God while in the effort to realize these desires in the form of service obligations and responsibilities. For this reason, humans are given the to choose between good and bad things. God himself has given trust to humans so that people always choose the good. God has made freedom an ethical foundation for humans to do. However, it turns out that there are many people who are unable to maintain God's trust; Most humans often choose bad deeds. The failure of religious obligations and irresponsibility is a form of human error in choosing freedom, and at the same time betrays God's trust in humanity. The failure of humans to fulfill their obligations and responsibilities is caused by the shortsightedness and narrowness of the human mind, and because of the shortsightedness and narrowness of the mind, humans often lose moral balance. In a long time, shortsightedness and narrowness of the mind will make the conscience of humans frozen, as a result humans increasingly away from the nature of events. Setiap individu tidak secara otomatis mampu merealisasikan keinginannya, namun manusia dilarang melupakan Tuhan selama dalam usaha merealisasikan keinginan tersebut dalam bentuk pengabdian kewajiban dan tanggungjawab. Untuk itu manusia diberi kebebasan memilih antara hal yang baik dan yang buruk. Tuhan sendiri telah member kepercayaan kepada manusia agar manusia senantiasa memilih yang baik. Tuhan telah menjadikan “kebebasan” sebagai “landasan etika” bagi manusia dalam berbuat. Akan tetapi ternyata banyak orang yang tidak mampu memelihara kepercayaan Tuhan tersebut; manusia kebanyakan sering memilih perbuatan yang buruk. Tidak terlaksananya kewajiban-kewajiban agama serta sikap tidak bertanggungjawab adalah bentuk kesalahan manusia dalam memilih kebebasan, dan itu sekaligus menghianati kepercayaan Tuhan kepada umat manusia. Gagalnya manusia menunaikan kewajiban dan tanggungjawab disebabkan oleh kepicikan dan kesempitan pikiran manusia, dan karena kepicikan dan kesempitan pikiran itu, manusia sering kehilangan keseimbangan moral. Dalam waktu yang lama, kepicikan dan kesempitan pikiran akan menjadikan “hati nurani” manusia beku, akibatnya manusia semakin jauh dari fitrah kejadiannya.",

This is the reason why wise states will not endure, in the midst of effort and industriousness, that sort of political parasitism which is confused by stern moralists with the idleness of wealth accumulated by hard work. This latter is a necessary idleness and useful insofar as society expands and the administration of public affairs contracts. By parasitism I mean that kind of inactivity which contributes neither labour nor wealth to society, which accumulates without ever losing, and which the masses regard with foolish admiration and the wise with scornful compassion for those victims who fall into its clutches and who lacking that drive towards an active life which is given by the necessity of caring for or increasing the requisites of life, let all their energies drift at the mercy of the passions of opinion, which are not the weakest of passions. We cannot call someone a social parasite who enjoys the fruits of his own forefathers' virtues or vices and who, in return for his temporary pleasures, dispenses bread and a livelihood to the industrious poor, and who wages by means of his wealth the silent war of trade in peacetime, rather than waging with force the uncertain and bloody sort of war.",

A's action is altruistic if and only if A's ultimate motive in performing the action is the furtherance of some other individual's (or individuals') welfare. A's action remains altruistic even if, as a matter of fact, the other individual receives no benefit (because of some unforeseen interference, say). And A's action remains altruistic even if, as a matter of fact, A (and A alone) benefits from the action, so long as that outcome was not A's ultimate motive. If A acts to benefit B but A's ultimate motive for doing so is that furthering B's welfare promises in turn to benefit A (via boosting A's reputation, say), then A's action is not altruistic but selfish. On the face of it, there is no reason to assume that this distinction is exhaustive. It seems possible that actions can be done for motives that have nothing to do with benefiting anyone, or can be done for mixed motives where benefits to both actor and other are important motivating factors but neither is ultimate.",

      "abstract": "It was not easy to pin down the true identity of an occasional self that normatively acted and presented itself differently on different occasions according to the ever-changing and recombining relations in which it stood to other people – a self moreover, whose occasional character was tirelessly promoted by conduct books prescribing the proper conduct of the same person in different social and interpersonal relations (as master and servant, husband and wife, parents and child, mistress, companion, daughter, sibling or friend, etc.). Considered empirically, such a self was almost inevitably deceptive – as deceptive as only viewing the side of Plato’s table that presented itself to one’s gaze and assuming or imagining the rest. As we saw in the Introduction, Locke described ascriptions of identity to this empirical self as forensic fictions – constructions of some part(s) of the subject that shifted according to the interlocutor, the observer and the occasion on which a self was invoked, and left the subject’s true being as indeterminate and mysterious as “the thing in itself” to an observing eye. As Locke stressed, no one could observe what was really going on inside someone else’s head or heart; and what was going on inside one’s own was changing all the time. The problem was compounded by a culture of politeness, which required the well-bred to conceal their thoughts and passions behind agreeable sentiments, complaisant conduct, and an amiable demeanor. Since polite letter-writers too assumed any character required by the occasion and the relation in which they stood to their addressee(s), letters were paradigmatic instantiations of the deployment of shifting occasional selves, and of the problems of identity they posed, especially since, like people posing on the internet, letter-writers could assume characters that did not exist.",

      "abstract": "The people in this situation were faced with an option to help someone in distress, and they did not choose to offer aid. This is a dramatic example of a situation that people face every day. An encounter with a beggar on the street, a request to give blood, or a call from a friend who is lonely or depressed—each is a situation in which someone can do something to benefit someone else. Such activity may be termed positive social action. Such acts as donating money or goods to charity, cooperating with others in carrying out a project, and doing favors for a person in need are typical examples of positive social action. Behavior of this kind may be contrasted with antisocial action, such behavior as aggression, destruction, and selfishness. Some theorists use the term prosocial behavior to stress the contrast with antisocial behavior. Other theorists prefer to use the term altruism, to emphasize the element of selflessness that exists in many helping situations. Altruism is action that benefits other people and is carried out with no expectation of external reward. Whatever words are used and with whatever emphasis, however, such action is worth investigating because it is deemed morally admirable and also contributes to the survival of society (Poplawski, 1985). Most people admire the individual who makes sacrifices so that others may benefit, and probably everyone agrees that society would be better off if everyone were less self-centered.",

Animal experiments also demonstrate the devastating effects of stressful unpredictabilities.

      "title": "Of Casual and Seriousness",
      "abstract": "Casual is an attribute that denotes not permanent or regular rather it is accidental or random. It means happening by chance, not planned rather incidental e.g., a casual encounter, a casual meeting, a casual visit etc. It is made or done without much care or thought viz., a casual remark, a casual invitation. Thus, the term casual is widely used. In derogatory sense it signifies irresponsibility showing too little concern and interest as well. For example, the company’s casual attitude to office security invites danger. It stands for not careful or thorough i.e., not serious eg., a casual inspection, a casual glance at a book, a casual observer. In case of clothes, a casual short-sleeved shirt is an example of casual wear which is simply an informal dress. Similarly, in the market shoes are displayed with the message :a pair of man’s casuals. Shoes, clothes, etc. designed for informal occasions do not obey dress conduct.Thus, casual wear means relaxation. It disobeys or rebels against the so-called conduct. Here, men and women enjoys free style which differs from so-called smart wear.",

But “abandon” has another meaning, that of indulging in some uninhibited action, giving oneself over completely to something, perhaps only to find later that one has lost interest or that the practice is no longer respected or understood. However enamored we may be with an action, at some point, in response to fashion or utility, we move on. To what degree this shift occurs consciously or deliberately is a matter for discussion, one that concerns the dubious term “progress” and the extent to which we are in control of the evolution of our own species—or even want to be.",

      "abstract": "Happiness is a multidimensional construct comprising of emotional and cognitive elements. It is related with positive emotions whereas intellectual, emotional and spiritual growth balance our material pursuits and make us happy. Happiness can be achieved provided one has the wisdom of discovery, the wisdom of contentment, the wisdom of gratitude, the wisdom of giving and wisdom of self-actualization. Spirituality is to some extent an one-to-one communication with the divine without the influence of any organization or a set of dogmatic views. It is based more on personal experiences rather than the experience of others. Religion may be defined as a way of life revealed in emotional expressions and inspired by faith in God or in a supernatural power which controls and guides the action of man and the destiny of world. Man often feels that his life is incomplete and imperfect. He longs for perfection. This longing makes him to seek the help of some supernatural power which can do for him things that he cannot do for himself. Hence, the objectives of the present research were framed to study the state of happiness, spirituality and religiosity among male and female elderly and to study the relationship and contribution of spirituality and religiosity towards the state of happiness. The sample comprised of 360 elderly persons (180 males and 180 females) in the age group 65years and above, only those elderly were selected for the sample who were leading a retired life, were not suffering from any deadly disease and belonged to middle socio-economic status families. The sample was equally distributed over the three cultural zones of Punjab naming Malwa, Majha and Doaba. Data were collected through questionnaire-cum-interview method. Results revealed that significantly more happiness was perceived by elderly males as compared to their female counterparts. Positive and significant relation between spirituality and state of happiness but non-significant relation between religiosity and state of happiness among elderly were found. Correlation analysis showed positive and significant relationship of happiness with spirituality but negative and non-significant relationship of happiness with religiosity among elderly.",

      "abstract": "Maximizing Prudent Behavior (practicing the Virtue of Prudence) is what Smith means by the concept of self-interest (caring for one’s self). The primacy of the virtue of Prudence was established by Aristotle based on earlier discussions by Plato. All of the other major founders of different systems of virtue ethics (for example, Confucius or Buddha or Aquinas) have emphasized prudence, since it is not possible to give anything to anyone else if you have not been successful in attaining income or financial resources yourself. There can thus never be any conflict between Self-interest (Prudence) and Benevolence (Beneficence), since these virtues deal with different situations confronted by a follower of virtue ethics at different times in their lives. Applying the virtue of Beneficence can only possibly occur after the practice of prudence has been implemented successfully. There will always be a significant lag in time during which the prudent individual has been successful in attaining financial resources and circumstances occurring which will allow him/her to later practice beneficence. Only after they have successfully attained significant financial resources through prudent behavior will they be in a position to practice benevolence (beneficence). Smith would have considered it obvious that the baker, brewer and butcher had to practice the virtue of prudence first, and be successful, before that could practice the virtue of benevolence (beneficence) second.",

Therefore it is not unusual for a person with dementia to be energized by a need and to become distressed when it is not met. In such circumstances, the energy may be expressed in terms of feelings and emotionally driven activities (shouting, aggression), and thus trigger a challenging behaviour.",

      "abstract": "People with Alzheimer's dementia experience significant neuropsychological decline, and this seems to threaten their sense of self. Yet they continue to have regard for their moral standing, especially from the feedback they receive from others in relation to such things as pride in their work, retaining a valued role, or acting out of a sense of purpose. This continuing self-regard is based on a self-image which often persists through memory loss. I will argue that in care settings the self-image ought to be assumed to remain intact. Treating a person with Alzheimer's dementia supportively and respectfully as the person with a certain role or identity—say as scientist, musician, janitor, parent, or friend—fosters an environment in which they are best able to retain what I call moral self-orientation. The latter notion is central to the well-being of social persons, and so it takes on special significance for people with dementia because, although their remembering selves are fragmenting, their self-image persists. Normative aspects of the self-image, I argue, require a social framework of support to sustain the self-image.",

In that sense should be no interpretation in line with giving new insights on the teachings of Sufism such as: ascetic, and resignation. The Sufis over the world looked like fire, where they can take advantage of limited needs, while remaining aware of the spark that will someday burn scorch everything. In this case they said: “If the property is collected, it should be to meet the obligations that must be met, and not for personal gain excessive”. Being a Sufi is not to be poor and the needy, but if God gave them the ordeal in the form of poverty mean He is happy with the condition and they remain grateful for whatever was offered by him. The glory of man in God’s eyes is not located on a lot or a little treasure but how his heart could always remember God day and night, hushed and crowded, thick and thin so any condition does not affect him to continue to draw closer to Him.",

Nothing is more important, few things more urgent, than to show they are neither banal nor nonsensical. It needs no showing, once understood the meaning of those first two words, ‘God is’; but we are in unprecedented danger of not understanding. Men have attained such control over the natural order and such sufficiency in the artificial (successful war does but further the process) as to have lost nearly all sense of dependency and insufficiency. With that sense goes the natural sense of God. Ideas of God may survive, but too often notional only, conventional; and sometimes, in journalism almost always, useful. As long as we are not as serious and at as great pains at knowing-and realising God for Who He Is as are secular investigators at planning and reorganising, we have only ourselves to blame that the public be interested in plans and! not in churches. Nor should we too glibly prophesy the ruin of the godless order; planning is not a whit the less efficient and administrable in the short run for being without God; it is merely soulless; only in the very long run is it doomed. But its spiritual poverty as long as it lasts, and its final ruin woud be imputable not to the planners, but to ourselves who failed to plan divinely; who failed to sift the dross of religious sentimentality and convention from the gold of God, and left God to be abandoned.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Animals are usually considered to lack the status of autonomous agents. Nevertheless, they do appear to make ostensible choices. This article considers whether, and how, I should respect animals' choices. I propose a concept of volitionality which can be respected if, and insofar as, doing so is in the best interests of the animal. Applying that concept, I (we) will argue that an animals' choices be respected when the relevant human decision maker's capacities to decide are potentially challenged or compromised. For example, it will be best to respect the animals' choice when the human decision maker: (1) lacks accurate knowledge of the animal's subjective experiences; (2) does not know what will lead to desirable experiences or allow for the avoidance of undesirable ones; (3) is biased; (4) is less aware of the animal's specific situation; (5) cannot appreciate all elements comprehensively, including considering any (content‐neutral) value to the animal being allowed to make and implement a choice, such as where a lack of control or liberty would be unpleasant or where an animal would usefully learn from the process of choice‐making; and (6) when the animal's choice is achievable. This additionally suggests that we may often beneficially choose to set up situations that empower animals to make better choices.",

      "abstract": "Although all social action is directed at other people, many social actions are initiated by someone who did not perform the action. This form of social action is called bonded action - any action that is not a direct expression of the acting individual's will or decision - anything that someone asks, coerces, or forces another person to say or do. Bonded actions are characterized by the social bonds that hold a relationship together, but the action itself can also be directed at people outside the relationship. That actions are bonded means not only that they are initiated by or together with others within the same relationship; it often means that people are provided with resources to help them perform these actions. People who act on behalf of organizations are transformed into organizational centaurs. Not unlike the mythical centaurs, their individual human features are insufficient to restrain the collective power of which they are a part. Most people are affiliated with several relationships, and they perform different types of bonded actions. In this way, the individual's ability to act is divided, and each piece uses only part of the person's repertoire of actions. Both actions and emotions are divided and exercised as people move from relationship to relationship. The remainder of the chapter is an exploration of the interfaces between bonds and between individuals and their bonds. Some form of casting occurs in most social bonds as a method of creating correspondence between individuals and bonds. The concepts of greedy relationships and emotional labour are also discussed, as is the interface between bonds in such situations as multiple citizenship, whistleblowing, corruption, and match fixing.",

      "abstract": "The inalienable dignity of all human beings is independent of circumstances, capacities, or qualifications. Kantian autonomy (construed as the rational will, or the ability to exercise it) cannot ground such a notion. The roots of universal human dignity are more plausibly traced to the Judaeo-Christian worldview in which God loves all his children equally, despite their vulnerability and weakness. To mature morally is to come to realize that we gain nothing by insisting on our status, or ‘standing on our dignity’; we should recognize instead the dependency we share with all our neighbours.",

      "abstract": "Buddha’s ethical system of thought is extremely close to Adam Smith’s ethical system of thought, since both taught versions of virtue ethics.This paper involves an examination of the processes by which humans can attain happiness according to both Buddha and Adam Smith.Both agree that to attain happiness requires an individual to master and apply virtue ethics.The emphasis is initially placed on the application of the virtue of prudence. Prudence is required initially because each individual must first be able to care (meet the needs) for himself/herself before it would be possible to care (meet the needs) for others. The role of attaining money is as a means to an end. Attainment of money as an end itself leads to unhappiness because the material things (wants, not needs) that money can buy can never make one happy, but serve only to constantly and temporarily deflect the decision maker from attaining Buddha’s “balanced” view of life (Aristotle’s golden mean-temperance) by assuming himself with what Smith described variously as baubles, trifles, trinkets, toys and ornaments. Buddha described this type of behavior as “grasping or clinging” to a belief that wealth and riches will make you happy. Smith spends a number of pages in The Theory of Moral Sentiments discussing the rationale of what he calls the “poor man’s son”.A systematic approach that incorporates elements of both Smith’s and Buddha’s thought is Wing Chun (Temple).",

Objects of taste are not present, inert, available and at our service.They give themselves up, they shy away, they impose themselves. ‘Amateurs’ do not believe things have taste. On the contrary, they make themselves detect them, through a continuous elaboration of procedures that put taste to the test. Understood as reflexive work performed on one’s own attachments, the amateur’s taste is no longer considered (as with so-called ‘critical’ sociology) an arbitrary election which has to be explained by hidden social causes. Rather, it is a collective technique, whose analysis helps us to understand the ways we make ourselves sensitized, to things, to ourselves, to situations and to moments, while simultaneously controlling how those feelings might be shared and discussed with others.",

Therefore, jurisprudence has long hesitated to accept the idea of compensation for psychological damage. This type of damage affects the so-called social aspect of moral, literary or psychological edema, usually to be associated with physical damage, or affects the emotion or feeling of pain caused by the self and sorrows. Hence, he attributes the emotional aspect of moral and psychological edema, so that he alone is not accompanied by material damage, and has inflicted on other things of a financial nature, such as religious belief or moral ideas. Human dignity is based on the principle of human equality.

      "abstract": "In general. an understanding of leisure should take account of the dimensions of time, activity and experience. But, leisure time is usually considered as residual time that individuals can use for their relaxation, diversion, social interaction or personal developments, free from work and other duties. However, it is not simply free time, as many unemployed people argue that such enforced time free from work does not provide them with true leisure. When we consider leisure as activity, we often list hobbies or pastimes that we choose to be involved in because we value and enjoy them. Leisure may offer means of diversion separate from non-leisure activities such as work, or an opportunity for self expression or self-development. To that degree, leisure is not a purposeless activity. It is said that leisure is a state of mind or mental condition in which we find freedom in a freely chosen activity that we undertake for its own intrinsic reasons. In other words, leisure is in the mind of the participant, and it is activity that is chosen primarily for its own sake. However, in contemporary concept, it is clear that leisure includes some ideologies in which there are educational and social purposes intentioned to control people. In this sense, the most important meaning of leisure is that leisure is not just free time, rather it is closer to social welfare aspect in contemporary society. Leisure does not exist any more as traditional concept.",

These reflections, then, comprise a series of related but not necessarily connected thoughts, observations, and notes whose sole, common link is the contemplation of the body of work of a master. This work, despite the many years during which I preoccupied myself with a close study of it and even carried out in my own work ideas and tendencies directly derived from and based on it, still puzzles and disturbs me and gives me no complete satisfaction because I find in it much, though fascinating, that does not convince me. And yet, for all that, the serious lacks or imperfections or, even now, alien elements (as I see them) of his art do not obscure or overbalance or diminish the compelling power and beauty of portions of his work and, occasionally, entire compositions. The stance of my particular approach to the problem of coming to grips with Schoenberg is best conveyed by this journal entry of Delacroix dated November 1, 1852:",

      "abstract": "Abstract If respect for autonomy is a moral requirement, then it is good, other things being equal, to permit people to do what they want to do. Other things are not equal in an organization, which almost by definition creates relationships that entail obligations and other limits on autonomy, but organizations can also increase one’s autonomy, which in any case remains an important moral consideration. Autonomy is not simply a matter of doing what one wants: if it were, then the weak-willed person, the addict, and the victim of brainwashing would all be autonomous. The threat to autonomy in the organization comes in part from the organization’s power to compel people to do what they do not want to do and have no legitimate obligation to do and also from people’s doing exactly what they want to do; people may act on desires they prefer not to have or would prefer not to have if they thought about them. Chapter 5 argued that to do what one wants to do when one wants to do something that is not the object of a rational desire is to act less than fully autonomously. The distinction between first-order and second-order desires provides us with an insight into human motivation but does not by itself enable us to distinguish between autonomous desires and others, since second order desires too may result from addiction or brainwashing. If an organization affects Smith’s second-order desires in a way that serves the interests of the stockholders or managers but not of Smith, then we surely have some reason to say that her autonomy has been violated. Defining autonomy, Chapter 5 showed, is a difficult philosophical problem; there is a practical difficulty, too, for the manager who wants to do what every manager has a moral obligation to do, which is to manage an organization that respects autonomy in a way that is consistent with effectively achieving legitimate corporate objectives.",

This logic sought to abolish interiority's multiplicities and to render the subject more strictly unified and calculating, a subject stripped of otherwise inextricable ties to its \"other\" (both within and beyond the subject) for whom penance is performed. The Form argues that extreme ascesis did not necessarily entail a reduction of the self to an exterior presence and fullness, nor did it inevitably assimilate the ritually exteriorized subject to its social engagements and towards an abolishment of the inner life. Yet penitential practices often lead to an exploitation of the body in these terms and do so through a disavowal of fragility — a fragility that for Rolle was essential to and constitutive of the contemplative subject.",

On the one hand depressives have the desire to incorporate and to possess in a compensatory-fusionary way objects and on the other hand, since the objects lose by this their object character, they fear them at the same time. Partners of depressives experience themselves often as being totally in their hands respectively \"devoured\" by them. How so ever the fusion of the depressives might be, they always suffer from the impression having lost their self as well as the objects. Submitted to their narcissistically uncathected archaic superego, depressives are strictly directed towards law and order. An individual who is not able to accept himself in such a way, has also no possibility for an object love since the basis of each object relation is always the enlargement of the self onto the object and only on this basis an identification can be realized. Due to a narcissistically insufficient cathexis of the body respectively of certain body functions, pains are often experienced, whereby it may happen that the pain experience represents the depression itself. Due to this narcissistic deficiency the depressive considers himself to be outside any social relationships. The depressive suffers therefore not only from the lost self but also from the object from which he feels estranged. In mania however the people concerned succeed to have the enthralling experience of a compensatory grandioe self and of the fusion with the object. Why this defense against the narcissistic emptiness respectively depletion is possible, even when admitting a genetic predisposition, must still be clarified.",

However it is more than has been said society-oriented : the refusal of Achilleus to get his arete used by others is quite abnormal, and the arete is not reserved to very few ; so, later on, it will become a civic value. For the hero himself it is constitutive of his self, so that it was very harmful to wrong it by undermining his reputation. The time allows one to evaluate and classify the men, giving them a precise place in the society, which must be determined both by superiority in birth, power or wealth and by the display of arete, Therefore a conflict is possible when there is only one geras for the King and for the best warrior",

Explaining life and its origin is rich in paradoxes and far from denitive (Bedau, 1998). From a theoretical and technical standpoint, life may only exist in systems that are dynamic and very complex (Prigogine and Stengers, 1984; Kauman, 1993). us, asking that a denition for life should be at the same time brief, popular, and scientically accurate is wrong. Most dictionary-like abbreviated definitions or colloquial denitions of life are too truncated or too simplistic to be acceptable. ey may serve but a segment of the public and certainly not the specialist. An acceptable denition for life cannot be constrained for size or simplistic on purpose. It will be in the form of a description of the essence and fundamental properties of life and will be tailored to a specic purpose and target audience. It is also possible that a denition of life is not something that a person with inadequate academic training can be briefed about in a rush, that is, \"Life is not something that can be told about, it may have to be taught.\"",

At the level of doctrine it postulates a supernatural or mystical determinacy in human affairs such that the whole course – or at least significant parts – of each individual's life is set, if not minutely pre-ordained, by pre-natal allocation, prescription or commitment. Whether it is beneficent or maleficent in the way it works out, at this level it is conceptualized as inescapable, irrevocable, and unknowable until it manifests itself. But there is another level, the level of practice, where dogma is translated into ritual action directed towards coping with the vicissitudes of daily life. And here we meet with a paradox, whether or not there are formulated doctrines or no more than the loosely phrased meta-physical or cosmological premisses that can be inferred from the practices of non-scriptural traditional religious systems.",

This has the consequence that one cannot sincerely assent to a prescription without becoming disposed to comply with it or to wish others to comply with it. The most obvious members of this class are those typically expressed in the imperative mood. The fact that many languages devote a grammatical mood specifically to this kind of speech act shows that their speakers assign a particular role to them. We must not assume, however. either that imperatives are the only kind of prescriptions, or that all imperatives are similar to each other in all their features, The imperative mood can be used to express military commands, polite requests, instructions for using hair-driers or cooking omelets or finding a friend’s house, entreaties, prayers. and any number of other kinds of prescriptive speech act. The most general term for speech acts of this kind is telling someone to do something, in contrast to telling him (or her) that something is the case. This applies even to prayers, where the speaker has no authority or power of enforcement, but is in a completely subordinate relation.",

Something like this is a necessary condition for virtue. Factors of motivation, especially those related to what a person's basic concerns are, can vary enormously. Imagine an extreme case. Someone might be inherently indifferent to what happens to other people, and have no sense of the inherent dignity or worthiness of moral principles, but also be totally convinced that God is watching his or her every move, and that the prospects of heaven or hell depend heavily on one's following accepted morality at every step.",

      "title": "Of Things Face-to-Face with Levinas Face-to-Face with Heidegger",
      "abstract": "Things are everywhere. They fill the world with their presence. Whereas it is possible to avoid the Other (person), to reject the encounter, to be solipsistic without condescension; to exempt oneself from an encounter-any encounter-with things is to die. Sensibility, having a body, is to be exposed to things. The body is the exposure. Yet, there are no things for Levinas. He encounters them within the economy of the Same, within a movement (of labor, of enjoyment) that takes its bearings from the Same and returns to the Same. Or he encounters them as gifts (TI 77), as the offer that the Same makes to the Other to welcome her/him, to cover her/his nakedness, and to enact the ethical relationship. It is the Other, however, who constitutes the principle of the donation, not the things themselves.2 In other words, things are for the Same, or for the Other, but not for themselves. That is, for Levinas there is no Otherness of things.3 Conversely, there are things in Heidegger. For him, things are the place where the gathering of the Fourfold-the mortals, the gods, the earth, the sky-comes to pass.4 But the intimacy of things and Fourfold is not fusion, it is dif-fering. Each thing remains other in hosting the Fourfold in its peculiar way: other than the Fourfold and other than any other thing; other than the mortals, who can dwell by things in their thinging only if they can take care of things as things, if they can let them be in their otherness. The purpose of this essay is to lay the theoretical foundations for an approach to things that does not ignore their Otherness. According to Heidegger, the enactment of this respectful relation encrypts the path human beings must follow to be faithful to their destination as mortals. Sharing Heidegger's conviction, this essay claims that in face of their relation with things, human beings determine the authenticity of their mortality, that is, of their being human. According to Levinas's suggestion, the place-which is not a place-where a relation with the Other can be achieved is ethics. Undoubtedly there is ethics in Levinas, even if his notion of ethics extends only to the other person (certainly the other man, hopefully, also the other woman and child).5 Conversely, there is no ethics in Heidegger, at least according to the most common reading. If the two thinkers are forced faceto-face in a confrontation that neither of them would advocate enthusiastically, the result is a chiasmatic structure,6 whose branches connect a double negation-non-ethics and nonthings-and a double affirmation-ethics and things. Since Socrates, philosophy has walked the path of negation. If there is ethics, it is not of things; and if there are things, they are not ethical. The path of affirmation is a narrow strip, which has seldom been explored.7 It leads to an ethics of things, where ethics cannot be traditional ethics in any of its formulations (utilitarian, deontological, virtue-oriented), and things cannot be traditional things (objects opposed to a subject). At the intersection between ethics and things, Levinas and Heidegger meet. The former offers the notion of a non-traditional ethics, the latter of non-traditional things. Some remarks are in order with respect to the modality of the meeting. Despite the common rootedness in Husserl's phenomenology, their encounter is not that of two Aristotelian friends; nor is the one the forerunner of the other; nor is the one in absolute opposition to the other. Levinas and Heidegger do not complement each other, either existentially or historically or philosophically (opposition being only the counterpart to complementation). They stand on their own as two separate, autonomous philosophical figures, one of whom, for chronological reasons, can exercise a sharp criticism of the other, which would be reciprocated, if chronology were to allow it. Their relation, escaping friendship, enmity, complementarity, is better characterized by the Derridian notion of supplement. …",

Hence, Diogenes invents his own method of enacting being, not through an argument but in and by an ergon, which is an action or deed that shows what being is by enacting how it is in the life that is worth living. The nontheoretical knowledge of being, then, is the enacting of being as well-being, and as such it is an exercise of living well through the deeds and accomplishments of one’s life. Being is therefore embodied in the good life, which for Diogenes is the life according to nature. Non-being, then, is the unnecessary and thus the dispensable conventions that go against nature and stand in the way and deny being as well-being or living well.",

There is a stock of knowledge theoretically available to everyone, built up by practical experience, science, and technology as warranted insights. But this stock of knowledge is not integrated. It consists of a mere juxtaposition of more or less coherent systems of knowledge which themselves are neither coherent nor even compatible with one another. On the contrary, the abysses between the various attitudes involved in the approach to the specialized systems are themselves a condition of the success of the specialized inquiry. If this is true for the various fields of scientific inquiry it is for even better reasons valid for the various fields of practical activity. Where our practical interests predominate we are satisfied with our knowledge that certain means and procedures achieve certain desired or undesired results. The fact that we do not understand the Why and the How of their working and that we do not know anything of their origin does not hinder us from dealing undisturbed with situations, things, and persons. We use the most complicated gadgets prepared by a very advanced technology without knowing how the contrivances work. No car driver is supposed to be familiar with the laws of mechanics, no radio listener with those of electronics.

The hollow object, which it produces, now fills it, therefore, with the feeling of emptiness. Its activity consists in yearning, which merely loses itself in becoming an unsubstantial shadowy object, and, rising above this loss and falling back on itself, finds itself merely as lost. In this transparent purity of its moments it becomes a sorrow-laden “beautiful soul,” as it is called; its light dims and dies within it, and it vanishes as a shapeless vapour dissolving into thin air.73 However it is valorized, then, the so-called beautiful soul seems destined to remain alien to the state, either transcending it in the wishful futurity of final fiction imperfectly prefigured in a fantasized feminine self or failing to rise to the requirement of real self-renunciation, stuck in the hopeless impotence of things of the past. In sharp contrast, Arnold’s beautiful soul, perversely, claims citizenship of the state at the present time as an ungendered alien self, while stubbornly preserving its resistance to simple, practical, limited reforms. Yet precisely by performing this resistance in the name of the state, reclaimed from both Humboldt’s curse (by rewriting it) and Hegel’s blessing (by ignoring it), its alienated writing turns “fitted for social service” and underwrites the impure, historical (limited, indirect, unintentional) actualization of its “sentiment . . . for beauty and sweetness” (C&A, 74) in the simple, practical, limited, womanly sort of form of the welfare state. Now that the demise of the welfare state seems pretty much assumed by most of the Arnolds of our time,74 it is tempting to think we know all he can teach us.

The repudiation of idols, the respect for God's transcendence, is what has led to relieving God from the task of being the ultimate explanation for the order of nature and the course of history. To explain something in terms of divine action or Providence always amounts to placing God among the finite causes we have already found or can imagine discovering. Once we have resolved to let God be God, we can no longer use God for our own cognitive ends. A similar unburdening of God seems appropriate in the domain of morality. When the validity of a moral demand is understood in terms of being God's command, the motive of the moral life becomes the desire to please God, as though we could help him or should fear him. Such a conception of God must appear as an all-too-human projection, if we assume that God must transcend such human needs and passions. We respect God as God when we learn to value the moral life for itself without appeal to God's purposes (though we may still believe that God loves what is good and right).",

      "abstract": "What is the slave’s relationship to the master and what is the master’s to the slave. It is hard to ignore Hegel’s model, bizarre though it is in seeing agency and subjectivity being possible for the slave more than for the master. The master, according to Hegel, depends on the slave’s acknowledgment of the master’s position for the master to recognize himself. The slave does not and is not in need of the recognition of the other since, having resigned himself, herself, to obedience, docility, labor, servitude, there is no point in seeking recognition from the other who sees the slave only as a thing compelled to obey. For Gikandi, this being is chattel, lacking subjectivity. But how does subjectivity come about for master and for slave? If the master depends on the slave, and not other masters, for her subjectivity, then it is framed by a relationship that is marked by all or nothing: the master has all the agency, the slave none due to the obligation to obey the will of the other, the master. But the master as other is not only dependent on his dependencies, his slaves, for labor and recognition; the master, as other, depends on the slave for a relationship in which the master can recognize himself. If the slave refuses, the master becomes decentered. There is a development Hegel envisions whereby the slave moves toward self-recognition by her work in which she sees her labor mixed in with her products, with her sense of herself as a person, an agent, a producer, a maker, thus emerging. The master fails to accomplish this position, having produced nothing with his own labor and seeing the products as having been made by the slave. It isn’t enough to own the slave and the products of his labor for the master since there is no recognition of himself in those products. “Through this rediscovery of himself by himself, the bondsman realizes that it is precisely in his work wherein he seemed to have only an alienated existence that he acquires a mind of his own” (Hegel 118–19; par. 196).1 The lord enjoys the object, but his enjoyment stops short of any recognition of a consciousness involved in the object and the work in creating it. Simultaneously, the slave cannot extend control over the object to the point of establishing total independence of it: “[the bondsman’s] negating of it . . . cannot go to the length of being altogether done with it to the point of annihilation; in other words, he only works on it” (par. 190), in contrast to the lord whose relationship to the object is always mediated.

      "abstract": "Humans possess the ability to speak, yet their rituals include acts as well as utterances, and in many of them special objects and substances are used or manipulated. Even rituals conducted in solitude often require the assumption of special postures, the performance of stereotyped movements or the manipulation of special paraphernalia and, like public rituals, they are often performed in special places at special times. We have a vision, all the more true for being idealized, of children reciting their daily prayers not anywhere at any time, but kneeling, eyes closed and hands clasped, by their beds at the very end of their day, and orthodox Jews bind phylacterie to their arms and foreheads before morning prayer even when they are alone. Physical display is a wide-spread, if not universal, aspect of solitary as well as public ritual, and it is plausible to take it to be an aspect, and an important one, of ritual's self-informing operation.",

      "abstract": "For a radical hermeneutic, God is always and everywhere, in all the epochs, essentially withdrawn from the world, even as faith says He is omnipresent. His very self-giving is self-withdrawing, a-lethic. God is never given in some sheer excess of presence or plenitude… His presence is deferred even as it is revealed… God’s presence is always caught up in the play of presence and absence. The faith of the believer consists in staying in play with that play, which involves maximum risk and uncertainty. Far from having magical powers, the eyes of faith suffer systematic strain from having always to do with shadowy forms and twilight figures. – John D. Caputo 1 Philosophers typically like things to be determinate and decidable. Philosophers of religion, in particular, do not like to contemplate anything less than a god whose qualities or attributes are precisely delineated (usually in a highly abstract and technical language), with the overall aim of reaching a decision as to whether to categorise themselves as ‘theists’ and reality itself as ‘theistic’. To arrive at such a decision, it is often presumed that empirical evidence both in support of and against religious belief must be sought and carefully evaluated. And as a result of this almost forensic investigation a determination can be made as to how likely it is that religious belief is true. 2 Finally, only if the balance of probabilities tilts heavily in favour of religious belief is it rationally acceptable to make a personal commitment to religion, a commitment that is forever revisable and contingent on the latest proofs and disproofs of God’s existence published in the professional philosophy journals.",

      "abstract": "Anarchy is rarely or never upheld with consistency. In the pedagogy of Rousseau, there is a set purpose to let the child be guided by natural necessity rather than by human command, and to let him learn from the experience of physical facts rather than by obedience. “Keep the child solely dependent on things; you will have followed the order of Nature in the process of his upbringing. Never oppose to his unreasonable wishes any but physical obstacles or punishments resulting from the actions themselves — he will remember these punishments in similar situations. It is enough to prevent him from doing evil without forbidding him to do it …” (Emile, II). Remarkably, the theory that the method of authority is a poor substitute for the pedagogical power of nature has been accepted, in varying degree of enthusiasm or reluctance, by most schools of pedagogy and has demonstrated lasting power. Yet the authority of parents and tutors is present throughout pedagogical theories, even when it is passed over in silence. Childhood is the domain where the suppression of all authority is obviously impossible. The most radical constructs of anarchy, as soon as they rise above the level of idle rhetoric, admit of qualifications so far at least as the immature part of mankind is concerned. Anti-authoritarian theorists, with few exceptions if any, do not mean that authority should disappear or that it can ever cease to be a factor of major importance in human affairs. What thinkers opposed to authority generally mean is that authority can never be vindicated except by such deficiencies as are found in children, in the feeble-minded, the emotionally unstable, the criminally inclined, the illiterate, and the historically primitive.",

In spite of his assurance that equality is unrelated to physical or intellectual ability, Godwin makes individual and social liberty contingent upon the types of contributions one’s capacities allow. His political system inevitably produces exceptions (those who do not or cannot contribute to the general good) for which he needs to devise additional measures. People who lack the right kinds of mental and physical capacities prove to be an intractable difficulty. In his fiction, Godwin centralizes the idea that the mind should work in concert with the body, and sees incapacity in either of these as socially and personally problematic. We see this in his repeated use of automata, dolls, and characters who disengage from their bodies in various ways; and in his fictional use of rejuvenation and cure. Godwin speculates that when reason governs society, illness and incapacity will no longer be present. His attitude towards deformity is quite separate from his views on capacity. Deformity, in Godwin’s fiction, is usually a visual sign of an evil character, and he does not articulate the prodigious phase of disability.",

      "abstract": "A. Soundness of mind at the time of committing an offence is complementary to mental maturity as a condition for the criminal capacity of the perpetrator and is thus a condition for the criminality of his act. Accordingly, the perpetrator's mental disorder limits the criminality of his act, although not every such disorder has such radical legal consequences. If the disorder is cognitive , it must be such as to prevent the person from understanding the physical or social meaning of his conduct: if it is volitional , it must be such as to prevent him, at the time of his act, from choosing between performing the act and refraining from doing so. These are symptoms of mental disorder that negatives the criminal capacity of a person, and each of them is a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition. It is essential that this be due to a disease of the mind or an organic defect of reason. The disorder in question is therefore a radical one, and one that is also chronic if not permanent in nature, as opposed to temporary or less deep-rooted conditions such as a disturbed state, a trauma or emotional condition, impulsiveness in certain matters or urges that deviate from the normal in certain areas. B. The following remarks are confined to the absence of criminal capacity on the volitional level, to which we shall refer in short as “volitional insanity’. This is the case where the person at the time of his act did not have a choice between acting or not acting due to a disease affecting his mind. This case is also referred to as the commission of an act as a result of an irresistible morbid impulse.",

      "title": "Artificial Intelligence and Moral intelligence",
      "abstract": "We discuss the thesis that the implementation of a moral code in the behaviour of artificial intelligent systems needs a specific form of human and artificial intelligence, not just an abstract intelligence. We present intelligence as a system with an internal structure and the structural levels of the moral system, as well as certain characteristics of artificial intelligent agents which can/must be treated as 1- individual entities (with a complex, specialized, autonomous or selfdetermined, even unpredictable conduct), 2- entities endowed with diverse or even multiple intelligence forms, like moral intelligence, 3- open and, even, free-conduct performing systems (with specific, flexible and heuristic mechanisms and procedures of decision), 4 – systems which are open to education, not just to instruction, 5- entities with “lifegraphy”, not just “stategraphy”, 6- equipped not just with automatisms but with beliefs (cognitive and affective complexes), 7- capable even of reflection (“moral life” is a form of spiritual, not just of conscious activity), 8 – elements/members of some real (corporal or virtual) community, 9 – cultural beings: free conduct gives cultural value to the action of a ”natural” or artificial being. Implementation of such characteristics does not necessarily suppose efforts to design, construct and educate machines like human beings. The human moral code is irremediably imperfect: it is a morality of preference, of accountability (not of responsibility) and a morality of non-liberty, which cannot be remedied by the invention of ethical systems, by the circulation of ideal values and by ethical (even computing) education. But such an imperfect morality needs perfect instruments for its implementation: applications of special logic fields; efficient psychological (theoretical and technical) attainments to endow the machine not just with intelligence, but with conscience and even spirit; comprehensive technical means for supplementing the objective decision with a subjective one. Machine ethics can/will be of the highest quality because it will be derived from the sciences, modelled by techniques and accomplished by technologies. If our theoretical hypothesis about a specific moral intelligence, necessary for the implementation of an artificial moral conduct, is correct, then some theoretical and technical issues appear, but the following working hypotheses are possible: structural, functional and behavioural. The future of human and/or artificial morality is to be anticipated.",

For it is an ever-present problem which confronts every individual at all stages of his career after the dawn of consciousness. It is not limited to any particular aspect or department of life; it concerns the whole life of every human being from the cradle to the grave. Its existence may not be consciously recognized, and generally the choice of right and wrong action is unaccompanied by reflection; but the problem begins to operate as soon as the development of character begins, and people are always deciding between good and evil, whether they look inside their minds or not. For the formation of character depends on the manner in which the problems of conduct or morals are solved by each individual for himself. If he solves them correctly, he becomes good; If he solves them badly, he sows in himself the seeds of evil. The general problem, moreover, is essentially the same for all, though in each particular case its specific nature may vary according to particular circumstances.",

      "title": "Complicated Exchanges: The Handling of Authorised and Unauthorised Gifts",
      "abstract": "The early modern idea of gift-giving primarily involved binding exchanges of a wide spectrum of objects with varying degrees of value. As a rule, a gift either resulted in a gift or favour in return, or expressed gratitude for a service rendered. A 1735 German encyclopedia by Johann Zedler explained: ‘Giving gifts and to receive something in return is thus not wrong ... [although] ... wisdom is required if one wishes one’s gifts to achieve the desired effect.’. While the fiction of altruistic gift-giving — corresponding to the courtly virtue of generosity — may have been maintained, there were distinct rules of gift-giving, attesting to a multitude of presents and occasions. By today’s definitions, such gifts could be classed as awards or rewards, bribes or payments. They ranged from private, individual presents for relatives or friends to prestigious, highly symbolic public presents. Some of these were gifts of honour (Ehrengaben), acknowledging peers or persons of higher status; others were known as ‘gifts of grace’ (Gnadengaben) and presented to those of lower rank, usually in recognition of some service or event. Then there were ceremonially regulated diplomatic gifts, donations to churches, monasteries and convents, prizes for festivals and contests, testamentary donations and so on. As the exchange of presents occurred purposefully, with a specified goal, it was subject to certain standards and ceremonies similar to those governing other courtly behaviour patterns. These rules were probably implicit; they were rarely written down. Occasionally there were infringements of rules, and these instances are especially revealing. Focusing principally on paintings, this paper considers the rules and handling of authorised and unauthorised royal gifts.Schencken also, daß uns der andere wieder was dagegen erweise, ist gar nichts unrechtes (...)

The leitmotive of world transformation, the play of productive forces is to regulate the flow of things. Seduction is merely an immoral, frivolous, superficial, and superfluous process; one within the realm of signs and appearances; one that is devoted to pleasure and to the usufruct of useless bodies. What if everything, contrary to appearances-in fact according to the secret rule of appearances-operated by (the principle of) seduction? (Baudrillard 1988: 162) ‘...

      "abstract": "The environmental crisis in human dignity lies not just in the overuse, the misuse, and the decay of physical settings, but far more significantly in how we conceive of the individual in relation to any such setting. In the design and organization of physical settings, the human properties of the individual are ignored, oversimplified, or implicitly assumed, because of the influence of such socioenvironmental values as scientific‐technological progress, urbanism, pseudoprogress (novelty and change), and the value placed on an ever increasing acceleration of technological change. Spaces and places are improperly designed not only in physical terms; designs overlook human needs for privacy, territoriality, freedom of choice, etc., and the conceiving of the individual as a simple “machine man.” Unintended consequences are often ignored and no attempt is made to evaluate just how well the setting actually works. The danger is that the person will adjust and at the price of a continuing erosion of the properties that make him distinctively human. It is imperative that as behavioral scientists turn to the systematic study of man/environment problems they recognize the need to maintain the contextual reality and integrity of any such problem as it evolves, develops, and becomes modified in the time framework of a complex society.",

      "title": "Anxiety, Freedom and Democracy",
      "abstract": "Arousing anxiety is one of the most important instruments of tyranny. Arousing anxiety is a weapon used not only by dictatorial societies, but also by the dictators of the family, school, workplace or organization. The essence of anxiety is the inability to actively control situations perceived as threatening —the experience of this lack of control and the inability to avert the impending threat causes this situation. In the interest of preserving and strengthening their power, the person or group possessing crucial information is able to withdraw the possibility of control, or to portion it out as a reward; in this way anxiety is aroused in those affected. Arousing anxiety is not only an instrument, but can also be the essence of the exercise of power for its own sake. Tyrannical power wishes to ensure full freedom of decision for itself at all times and it therefore does not commit itself, not even in the form of an agreement serving its own interests. This is true for all relationships of dependency in which the more independent partner is able to withhold information, thereby keeping the other partner in a state of “loss of control”. If the plumber does not turn up at the time agreed and does not inform us of this beforehand, if the garage does not repair the car on the grounds of a shortage of spare parts despite the fact that they have parts, we are placed in a state of powerlessness. We encounter various forms of abuse of power and induced anxiety day after day, but do not pay sufficient attention to it, do not recognise it in its essence and do not understand how this slow-acting poison kills. However, we can also arrive at a psychological definition of freedom and democracy through an understanding of the essence of arousing anxiety and of anxiety.",

This is not a bridge that links distinct entities into a common purpose, resemblance, or mutuality. For, bridges also point to breaks and frictions in putting to work different operating systems. Without such frictions there is little motivation to work out ways of associating things that have no overarching reason to be associated. Endurance means to conjoin ourselves with others in the possibility of \"saying something\" that need not be summed up, that need not have specific parameters of efficacy or objectivity, something that keeps people going in and through transformations that are without precedent in the sense that they need not represent the culmination of a goal or necessity. It means the capacity to risk what is familiar, because what is familiar may not be what it seems to be; every ground and appearance is deceptive.",

The nub of the offensiveness in the “profound” cases is not personal resentment over a disagreeable experience, but outrage at the offending conduct on grounds quite independent of its effect on oneself. Examples of profound offenses include voyeurism, Nazis and Klansmen, execrated but “harmless” deviant religious moral practices, desecration of venerated symbols, and abortion and mistreatment of corpses. The offense principle does not warrant legal interference in a person’s private conduct on the grounds that those who know that the conduct is (or may be) taking place need protection from the profound offensiveness of their own bare knowledge.",

Their minds are sufficiently complex, and the demands made upon them sufficiently unpredictable, that the exact course of a given life cannot be anticipated. Hardy sees a potential opposition among the elements in a personality: and the actual working out of these oppositions remains in doubt until the reader sees exactly what the character is confronted by. It is the situation including, for instance, historical location that determines what is a conflict in a person's makeup. Jude's susceptibility to women is not in itself inconsistent with his desire to educate himself; nor is his willingness to accept new facts necessarily incompatible with a religious vocation. Neither Jude's actions nor their consequences are presented as inevitable effects of his character, considered abstractly; (in another world, there might be no conflict). But Jude's milieu forces him to make ruinous choices, and these choices define him.",

      "abstract": "In the human brain, simple molecules and complex circuits are constantly making decisions which are indispensable for our survival and also to accomplish a variety of daily activities such as walking, memorizing, conversing, composing music, painting or poetry.... All are the result of the integration of many neural systems that perceive many and simultaneous visual, tactile, auditory and/or mental stimuli. Once synthetized, they are immediately transmitted to the corresponding executive systems, thus completing the fascinating functional loop of decision-making: a) perception of stimuli or information which originate in the environment, b) selection and elaboration of the decision which is considered more appropriate or attractive according to personal experience or intuition and c) execution. If these neural nets have been damaged or haven failed to develop the mechanisms of facilitation or inhibition that govern them become unbalanced. If inhibition is reduced, excessive and violent behaviour is expressed as in patients suffering from manic phases. Conversely, if inhibition is excessive, decision making mechanisms are not operative. In either case, behaviour is not \"reasonable\" and does not follow prototypical patterns. All these processes must be the consequence of a constant molecular activity full of micro-decisions whose effectiveness depends on the histological and biochemical integrity of the neurons. This microenvironment is responsible for all types of decisions of all forms of life and represents one of the fundamental successes of evolution.",

There is nothing beyond it, ou side of it, or ove aga nst it that is needed to explain its origin, continuing existence, or irrepressible creativity. Nature itself, without a God, Goddess, gods, or animating personal spirits of any kind, is for me an appropriate and, indeed, the most appropriate focus of religious commitment and concern?especially for our ecologically conscious times. Thus, I am neither a monotheist, a polytheist, a pantheist, a panentheist, nor an animisi, and yet I claim profound religious value and meaning for the immanent, self-contained powers of nature?admittedly impersonal though they be?that produce, suffuse, and sustain us and all other forms of being. In another work I responded to a number of objections to a religion of nature so conceived, e.g., that nature is unworthy of religious commitment because it is wasteful, cruel, or indifferent to human beings; that nature is impersonal and so cannot be a fit object of worship or provide the personal nurture, guidance, and help in time of need that are necessary for meaningful religious lives; or that nature cannot be metaphysically or religiously ultimate because its existence can only be explained on the basis of something supernatural, something more fundamental than nature itself from which it derives its character and continuing existence.1 A further objection that might well be leveled against a religion of nature is the one I want to discuss in this essay. It is the complaint that a religion of nature is so radically, thoroughly immanental and mundane as to lack reference to dimensions of transcendence that are essential to robust religious faith and that play central roles in the religions of the world.",

Because it is a play, it is an icon of implicitness, as plays don’t say what they mean in the form of explicit messages from the author to the audience, but communicate implicitly through fictitious events and personages. In this particular play, the main characters demonstrate by means of what they say and do, that, for them, life’s meaning is associated with a longed-for consummation, a life- and purpose- -giving encounter, and that the action of waiting for this provides the focus for all their other actions and intentions, affecting the way they interpret whatever occurs in their world. They are committed to waiting for Godot to arrive; a state of mind encapsulated within the symbolic scenario which is the play. In other words, then, their behaviour chimes with the three defining characteristics of Implicit Religion: commitment, integrating focus, and extensive effects which proceed from an intensive concern, when these occur in circumstances which are not associated with explicit religion of any kind. The tramps themselves never mention God or religion, and the play’s author is recorded as saying ‘If I had meant God I would have said God’. Nevertheless the parabolic shape and the poetic language of the play produce an effect similar to that of religious ritual.",

Even when controlling religiousness and God belief, GTG was strongly related to divine attributions for the event, which seemed more plausible when God was seen as powerful and loving and when divine attribution made the event seem more meaningful. In addition to these cognitive judgments, divine attributions and GTG were linked with desire: wanting to see God as a cause. Relationally, GTG was associated with seeing God's intentions as positive (trying to help, love, comfort, encourage, or protect), with actually feeling loved, cherished, valued, or appreciated by God in response, and with seeing the event as a divine gift – a perception more likely when people saw God as a gift-giver: giving gifts often to many people, including themselves.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Transgressions or, beyond the Obvious I Recognitions and MisrecognitionsTransgression: it is a common enough word, circulated enough for us all to believe we understand what is meant by it when it is used.Ideas about what constitutes transgression are equally commonplace.Transgression, we might say, goes without saying.Yet, is that in fact the case?Or is it not that we are so used to what we take to be the idea of transgression that we have, in all truth, forgotten, or not even become aware of the extent to which transgression constitutes our identities?Believing we understand the term as indicative of breaking a law, doing something illicit, disrupting order and rebelling against societal norms, if and when we think we transgress we do no more than conform to expectations of acceptable 'deviance'.We act up in a manner already in some sense prescribed, whether socially or historically, and so merely conform in a way that is more or less tolerated, even when excoriated.Transgression however runs much deeper than that.It is, as I shall argue in the present volume, not merely the breaking of a code, a rebellion against normative social or cultural constraints; rather it is the very pulse that constitutes our identities, and we would have no sense of our own subjectivity were it not for a constant, if discontinuous negotiation with the transgressive otherness by which we are formed and informed.Identity must needs believe in its own stability for the conventions of transgression to apply.However, 'for a subject to imagine itself as having a stable identity', remarks Elisabeth Bronfen, is always an act of misrecognition (mésconnaissance), a fiction, an illusion…'.She continues, 'though language allows for a differentiation between self and Other… this differentiation is never complete and the imaginary register never disappears … In a sense any image is the death because the negation of the thing, for it signifies that something was thought or recognised, not as real but as an image' (Elisabeth Bronfen 1992, 395) Seeing oneself as having a stable identity is, then, to misrecognize one's selfhood.It is to project an image and take that simulacrum as the reality, as Bronfen suggests.From this basis of misunderstanding or, to anticipate the next citation, from this 'mode of production' that generates the social structure we call the self, the subject or identity, it is an all too easy step to imagine the self negated, the subject beyond the law, situated, and situating itself, in a locus of negativity, opposition, and transgressive rebellion.This leads to the following question.'If', asks Julia Kristeva, ' in certain modes of production, social structure projects itself…by circumscribing a represented, assumed, encased negativity…how does this closed place function generally, logically, outside the … system?' (97).Kristeva's inscription of precise location, of an inside and an outside in the definition of proscribed or outlaw act or event is instructive.It comments on the coercive nature of modes of production that are shaped by historical, cultural and ideological forces, which are themselves not stable but which shift endlessly, in order that a 'social structure' such as the subject might be incorporated in the mode of production, (mis)recognised as a product of that mode, or otherwise placed outside, expelled or marginalised.Identifying illicit practice, determined as a negativity in relation to, and yet closed off from the social structure, Kristeva defines in part at least the transgressive subject produced as a historical subject and determined through the reading of a transgressive space or locus.Her description of spatial position, of clearly defined positions based on perceivable oppositions such as I have indicated, is far from uncommon in the thinking of transgressive events.However, as valuable a starting point as it may be, Kristeva's reading does not take into account sufficiently the endless differentiation implied in Elisabeth Bronfen's argument, and",

      "abstract": "In common vernacular, work and leisure are framed as polar opposites: what is work cannot be leisure. Indeed, leisure is often construed as the 'left-over time' – time not spent at work, or on other obligations, time for doing anything … or nothing. By contrast, we will argue and oer various forms of evidence for a very dierent appreciation of work and leisure. In our view, leisure is the primary source of activity, inquiry, freedom, and love, while work is a secondary derivative, but one that can be chosen voluntarily and done in a leisurely fashion (e.g., to oer some obvious examples, piano playing, writing, video-game testing, experiential mathematics, etc.). Thus, in our view, work and leisure intertwine with one another and sometimes lose their boundaries altogether, more like the Yin-Yang symbol with mirror-opposite black and white embryos, each pregnant with its emergent other.",

What motivates that stranger to act, causing absolute harm to himself and death with no reward received in return? What motivates the dying man who has nothing to gain from charity decide to give away his fortunes to complete strangers? One answer is pure altruism, the selfless concern for others’ well-being at the cost of one’s own well-being, time, or energy. This would be a satisfactory answer that seems to have been accepted society, that selflessness can truly exist. However, there are serious concerns about the selfless aspect of altruism with some scholars, such as evolutionary psychologists and proponents of the social exchange theory, claiming that it is not merely unlikely for it to exist, but that it is outright impossible, while others counter these claims be it through innate, biologically, or religious conviction of divinely acquired selflessness or Batson’s infamous empathy-altruism hypothesis. Regardless of which route one takes, the means to the end do not require proper identification to notice that humans do participate in behavior that penalizes them and benefits others, but the question is can and do they do so independently of self-interest?",

      "title": "We Teach Art, but Can Art Teaches Us? John Dewey on the Significance of Art",
      "abstract": "AbstractThose who pursue a teaching career in art and design are most likely aware of one of its pressing dilemmas. On the one hand, as a subject situated in the postindustrial higher education setting where the progressive accumulation of knowledge – mostly in propositional form and explaining how things work in physical or social reality – constitutes its main purpose, art are unavoidably driven to adopt the same objective. On the other hand, most artistic activities are not aimed to produce and derived from replicable research propositions but conducted to generate novel artifacts, performances, narratives or experiences in order to enhance artistic universe. Regarding their being as artifactual, non-propositional and idiosyncratic, artworks are unfortunately regarded as mere products of subjective emotions, where it’s appropriate roles are nothing more than spectacles, entertainments or ornaments, which at the same time testify its marginal relationship with knowledge. However, this predicament is not as self-evident as it looks since it is in fact resulted from a particular philosophical outlook, namely, an outlook that bifurcates mind and body, rational and emotional, subject and object, and so forth that comes down to us from the Platonic and Cartesian tradition. It is precisely the thought of John Dewey that profitably conceives art prior to Platonic/Cartesian bifurcation which will be discussed in this paper. Art, for Dewey, is not a product of a mere subjectivity, but instead emerges from “experience,” understood as primary, pre-linguistic (hence pre-dualism) and embodied human-environment “transactions.” Located in such a primary domain, art regains its utmost significance. AbstrakMereka yang mengejar karir dosen di bidang seni dan desain kemungkinan besar menyadari salah satu dilemanya yang mendesak. Di satu sisi, sebagai bidang yang berada dalam lingkungan pendidikan tinggi pasca-industri di mana akumulasi pengetahuan progresif - kebanyakan dalam bentuk proposisional dan menjelaskan bagaimana hal-hal bekerja dalam realitas fisik ataupun sosial - merupakan tujuan utamanya, seni secara tidak terhindarkan didorong untuk mengadopsi tujuan yang sama. Di sisi lain, sebagian besar kegiatan artistik tidak bertujuan untuk menghasilkan, dan berasal dari proposisi penelitian yang dapat direplikasi namun dilakukan untuk menghasilkan artefak, performa, narasi atau pengalaman baru dalam rangka mengembangkan semesta artistik. Melihat keberadaan seni yang serba artifaktual, non-proposisional dan unik, karya seni dianggap sebagai semata-mata produk dari emosi subjektif, di mana perannya dianggap tidak lebih dari tontonan, hiburan atau ornamen, yang pada saat yang sama menyiratkan hubungannya yang marginal dengan pengetahuan. Namun, dilema ini bukan sesuatu yang sudah jelas dengan sendirinya, karena nyatanya dihasilkan dari pandangan filosofis tertentu, yaitu, pandangan yang membelah tajam antara pikiran dan tubuh, rasional dan emosional, subjek dan objek, dan sebagainya yang diturunkan pada kita dari tradisi Platonis dan Cartesian. Adalah pemikiran proseni dari John Dewey yang bergerak sebelum bifurkasi Platonis/Cartesian yang akan dibahas dalam makalah ini. Seni, bagi Dewey, bukan produk dari subjektivitas belaka, melainkan muncul dari \"pengalaman,\" dipahami sebagai \"transaksi\" manusia-lingkungan yang bersifat primer, pra-linguistik (oleh karena itu pra-dualisme) dan menubuh (artifaktual). Diletakkan di ranah semendasar ini, seni mendapatkan kembali signifikansi terpentingnya.",

Despite the scope of the task, however, most people have achieved in some measure a working agreement with themselves and with their environment. They have reasonably well integrated personalities and are able to see things in a proper perspective, allowing them a comfortable surplus of energy to be used for valuable productive and creative work. This happy state of affairs is, however, not possible for all people. A human life gone berserk is an awesome thing. The very power which elevates man to a level which can be called human can also turn upon him and create utter chaos in his world. If he were not a sensitive human creature, perhaps he could not become psychotic when he finds himself no longer able to cope with the problems confronting him; the fact remains that it is man's inescapable fate to think and to feel so long as he has intact the basic capacity which enables him to do so. If somehow the methods by which he accomplishes this task become entangled, he may lose contact with the reality around him and even destroy himself.",

When begging, they are intensely absorbed in their emotion. The beggar's behavior seems dually characterized: the childish behavior with insufficient control over the self and the tactical one for negotiation. Also in situations other than begging, they are often deeply involved in immediate interactions. They, as participants in the interaction, persist in having their way and display the unperturbed self. They refuse anything provisional about themselves. Also within the level of assumed reality which attendants in the gathering sustain, they persist in refusing anything provisional. They affirmatively front whatever is presented. They never bother themselves with whether the reality sustained is true or false. While they are lively within the reality which is shared by all attendants, they are in any situations required to be deeply involved in their activities.",

Eventually, the critical dimensions of mature thought are developed. Achieving the capacity for mature thought in which logical thinking plays an important part depends on the opportunity that the individual finds in the transactional environment of people, things, and patterned events. It proceeds through a spontaneous capacity for growth and development. It will occur in proper sequence, proportion and in balance if the individual is an actor in his own learning and if the environment is suitably designed to support all the developing mental capacities of the individual. The individual must always be acting in a patterned whole environment which displays structure, interdependence, and order in the parts. A valid sub-whole must be totally present for the child to interact with. The teacher must be aware of the sub-whole, present varied manifestations of it and display it in manipulable form. An unordered environment, or one beyond the rudimentary organizational capacities of the individual, cannot be understood by him and can support only primitive assimilation. A too ordered repetitive environment, without varied content, can support only accommodation per se imitation. Neither will build the mind nor lead to the achievement of logical thought. To summarize thus far, learning theories can contain directives for the development of logical thought for education in the elementary school and for reading instruction. Among these directives are the following: 1. The learner must be active in the environment. He is only beginning to think according to a mental review of the actions he would take in solving a problem as an actor in the environment. He uses and rearranges mental summaries (or abstractions) of events in the environment according to strategies or logical operations abstracted from procedures used as actor in the environment. He learns real knowledge when he can check his understandings by action in the",

For instance, if one is able to write one's own name, but unable to fill out a job application because he or she does not understand the words 'previous' or 'experience', is that person considered literate or illiterate? How much reading and writing ability must one possess before one can be considered literate? Questions such as this gave birth to the term functional literacy. Functional Literacy refers to one's ability to use language skills to cope with every day demands (IL Y, 1990). In other words, if one's ability to read and write is so limited that it prevents him or her from functioning in society, e.g. purchasing goods, reading a bus schedule or following instructions on a medicine bottle, then that person is by definition, functionally illiterate.

      "title": "The limits of professional vision : The observability and reportability of endodontic procedures",
      "abstract": "One characteristic of the modern society is a clear division of labour and a high level of specialisation. Many professions, like surgery, astrophysics and archaeology necessitate a complex mix of manual, visual, technological and discursive skills – skills that are not readily available or easily accessible to people outside professional communities. Without the relevant skills, one is not only incapable performing the work, but also unable to see and say what members are medically, astronomically, and archeologically doing. Objects such as cystic arteries, optic pulsars and ancient post molds are not just there for one’s naked and untrained eye to see. What is relevant here is not so much the cognitive mechanisms of individuals, but the skills and practices that are shared among “a community of competent practitioners, most of whom have never met each other but nonetheless expect each other to be able to see and categorize the world in ways that are relevant to the work, tools, and artefacts that constitute their profession” (Goodwin, 1994; p. 615).In this presentation, a general interest in «professional vision» and the observability and reportability of action will be investigated in the context of dentistry and dental education. With an approach informed by ethnomethodology and conversation analysis, the study investigates a series of seminars organized around live video broadcasts of endodontic procedures. In the seminars, groups of students under the guidance of a seminar leader are watching root canal treatments that take place in an adjacent room. During the broadcasted procedures, the seminar leaders continuously (and reg- ularly confidently) describe what the dentists do, see, think and feel. Central to these commentaries is the ability to see embodied actions in terms of formal procedures. However, there are also limits to this access. Despite the fact that the seminar leader and the dentist share an expertise in endodontics, not all aspects of professional conduct are similarly accessible or describable for an onlooker. For instance, while it is possible for seminar leaders to see that a dentist is searching for a root canal, it is much harder to describe in contingent detail what this searching consists of. In cases like this, the seminar leader might instead ask the dentist who is performing the procedure to explicate his or her actions and reasoning.The investigated setting actualizes a number of questions of general concern. What does it mean to observe and describe the professional actions of others? To what extent, or in which ways, can vision and perception be shared? Are some features of professional action less accessible or describable than others? In the investigated setting, these questions are central to the members themselves as instructional concerns. However, the observability and describability of professional conduct are also central methodological concerns for the social scientists who want to analyze such practices. Given that expert sometimes are unable to identify what other experts are doing, to what extent are those same actions describable by non-experts.Goodwin, C. (1994). Professional vision.

Such representation has significant antecedents in both parental representations (Freud, 1910; Rizzuto, 1979) and other affectively significant early objects and obtains from them prevailing emotional characteristics, which inevitably contribute to the dynamic organization of the relational or rejecting experiences the subject has with his/her personally conceived divinity.In this paper I offer a clinical example from a completed analysis to illustrate the patient’s libidinal and defensive and, at times, organizing use of the divinity during the course of his treatment.",

Hence the idea that rare acts, like rare objects and rare metals and gases, exist which are distinct and have particular psychological, cognitive, emotional, and social psychological effects. Human activities in general are not satisfied with the banality induced by repetition and the perfect knowledge that frequent acts bring, but they are guided more by a desire for innovation or progress, in other words, by a more or less chaotic tendency toward types of rare actions at a given moment. In many cases, the rare act can be considered as the goal of frequent acts, as something that gives them meaning and which, by transcending each of them, proves to be invaluable in moments of doubt, fatigue, and despondency.",

      "title": "Moving in extreme environments: what’s extreme and who decides?",
      "abstract": "Humans work, rest and play in immensely varied extreme environments. The term 'extreme' typically refers to insufficiency or excess of one or more stressors, such as thermal energy or gravity. Individuals' behavioural and physiological capacity to endure and enjoy such environments varies immensely. Adverse effects of acute exposure to these environments are readily identifiable (e.g. heat stroke or bone fracture), whereas adverse effects of chronic exposure (e.g. stress fractures or osteoporosis) may be as important but much less discernable. Modern societies have increasingly sought to protect people from such stressors and, in that way, minimise their adverse effects. Regulations are thus established, and advice is provided on what is 'acceptable' exposure. Examples include work/rest cycles in the heat, hydration regimes, rates of ascent to and duration of stay at altitude and diving depth. While usually valuable and well intentioned, it is important to realise the breadth and importance of limitations associated with such guidelines. Regulations and advisories leave less room for self-determination, learning and perhaps adaptation. Regulations based on stress (e.g. work/rest cycles relative to WBGT) are more practical but less direct than those based on strain (e.g. core temperature), but even the latter can be substantively limited (e.g. by lack of criterion validation and allowance for behavioural regulation in the research on which they are based). Extreme Physiology & Medicine is publishing a series of reviews aimed at critically examining the issues involved with self- versus regulation-controlled human movement acutely and chronically in extreme environments. These papers, arising from a research symposium in 2013, are about the impact of people engaging in such environments and the effect of rules and guidelines on their safety, enjoyment, autonomy and productivity. The reviews will cover occupational heat stress, sporting heat stress, hydration, diving, extreme loading, chronic unloading and high altitude. Ramifications include factors such as health and safety, productivity, enjoyment and autonomy, acute and chronic protection and optimising adaptation.",

      "abstract": "Abstract While agent responsibility appears to be one of the clearest examples of a human distinctive, practices of holding responsible are bound up with social expectations and emotional reactions, many of which are shared with other social animals. This essay attends to the ways in which what Peter Strawson first identified as the reactive emotions, including notably anger, resentment, and indignation, are key to making sense of both the shared and distinctive features of responsible human agency. Like human beings, other social animals express a range of reactive emotions in response to others’ conformity with or violation of implicit social expectations and norms; human beings sometimes reflect on these reactive attitudes and their justifiability, asking whether and when it is appropriate to hold others accountable, blame, and/or punish them. We should recognize that we often praise and blame others for attitudes and desires which they have not chosen and over which they have no direct control, and that this is appropriate.",

The members of this eclectic group instantiate virtually every symbolic relation under the sun: they denote, refer, represent, notate, exemplify, express, describe. In his seminal and difficult book, Languages of Art, Goodman undertakes to provide an analysis of these various relations, sharply segregating his theoretical concerns from merely ‘applied’ or ‘practical’ (e.g. psychological) ones. The following remarks are characteristic: The ... stated requirements for a notational system are all negative and general, satisfiable by systems with null or even no [syntactic] characters A good many other features that might be thought essential are not covered ... No requirement of a manageably small or even finite set of atomic characters, no requirement of clarity, of legibility, of durability, of maneuverability, of ease of writing or reading, of graphic suggestiveness, of mnemonic efficacy, or of ready duplicability or performability has been imposed. These may be highly desirable properties, and to some degree even necessary for any practicable notation; and the study of such engineering matters could be fascinating and profitable. But none of this has anything to do with the basic theoretical function of notation systems. (154)",

I. TWO WAYS OF BEING JUDGEDWhen called to account by our nearest and dearest, it is normal to expect their judgement to be tempered not just with mercy but also by knowledge: not only of the conduct in question and its context, but knowledge of our character.We expect to be judged by those closest to us in all our particularity.We hope they know us and thus show a greater understanding of our deeds because of their knowledge of our characters or 'selves'.We are not strangers but intimates, with a history.Thus it is that those who know me best know that I am often tardy and, although they are rightly beyond excusing this inexcusable behaviour, they now plan with it in mind.I'm told, for example, to arrive for meetings earlier than they are actually scheduled to start.In addition, their judgement of this aspect of my conduct is in some sense mitigated or restrained by their knowledge of me; what they would invariably regard as inexcusable in others in most contexts, they sometimes find acceptable in me in some contexts.My nearest and dearest clearly do not judge me by standards generally applicable to the rest of humankind.The law does.Or, at least, it purports to judge me in the same way as it judges all its addressees.This is because bourgeois law's judgement is abstract.That is to say: it judges us (i) not in all our particularity but as identical abstract beings; (ii) by reference to general and objective standards equally applicable to all such beings; (iii) the application of these standards being mitigated only by a limited range of exculpatory claims. 1It follows from these three components of law's abstract judgement (hereinafter 'the three components' or 'the components') that one cannot, in absence of a",

      "title": "Aesthetic regulation of objectionable representations.: A semiotic approach to memorials and religious architectural space.",
      "abstract": "Whenever a material object is selected to represent a physically absent, but emotionally present referent, such as a religious figure or a deceased relative, we have a complex representation situation that involves what we could tentatively label “transgressive cognitive acts”. A transgressive cognitive act is here meant to involve a part that is experienced as present, and as having an effect, but not evidenced from a rationalist or scientific perspective on existence. Sometimes, the complexity of this type of representation is such that argumentation beside the theological, e.g. aesthetic, comes to stand as vicarious to theological or existential opinions about the matter. The semiotics of such vicarious representation have to consider a “leaking” communication model where one part in the trinity - of the sender, the receiver or the referent - escape a coherent or evidenced definition (God can be all three, depending on type of communication). The fact that empirically non-existing referents have been recognized and theorized in semiotics (Eco; Sonesson; and others) does not explain why certain cases of absent semiotic agents, linked to religious belief, or to sense of presence in grief of a deceased person, may give rise to such extreme degree of emotion or sense of existence.Departing from a narrated episode written by J M Coetzee, about the controversy brought up by a crucifix, turning into a quarrel about aesthetic preferences, this paper discusses a series of designed or spontaneously created spatial representations of physically absent, but indirectly and emotionally present referents, as they appear in memorials, cemeteries and funeral chapels. In public acts of memorialisation, the physical objects that represent the deceased – like gravestones or memorial objects placed at sites representing the dead – are often strictly regulated, differently in different cultures. When for instance they appear at unexpected places in the urban environment, or with unfamiliar looks, memorials and their material culture can become highly controversial or be regarded as objectionable.These materialisations with a relation to religion, or existential belief, may give rise to arguments where the aesthetic aspect is the last chance to state a principle order in the cultural scheme in which they are debated. Such arguments are actualised in the current debate about post-secular societies, where it is for instance stated (Habermas) that both religious and secular mentalities must be open to a complementary learning if we are to balance shared citizenship and cultural difference in the post-secular society. It is an objective of this paper to show that the recognition of a semiotics that involves the paradoxical presence of emotionally strong, but fundamentally absent parts in communication can contribute to the aesthetics of physically present, but existentially debated objects, as well as to the discussion about the confronting as well as conjoining elements of regulation of these issues in society.

      "abstract": "If the individual is a black box, an encounter is a risk that has to be managed. In everyday life, no one stops to think about relationships. Unless they serve an intention that “is not self-evident”, that makes an unusual emotion emerge. Do we think about the way we say hello to a colleague, unless we intend to get something from this “hello”? The transposition of the human relationship in the professional environment leads to a change in the reality level: putting on the clothes of a character and playing his part in a logical context that serves the aim and the plan of the organization, that itself is under the pressure of a demand that is quantitatively insatiable, and technically extremely demanding. Since the creation of wealth does not rely on an open-ended honey pot, de facto, the performance requirement becomes both an individual and group concern. The organization performance cannot suffer from the excessive variableness of the professional character’s reactions. Paradox among the paradoxes, getting the best out of the relational potential of a system that is organized, focused, constrained, would then consist in establish- ing an evolutionary relational framework to control, without killing it, what, out of the professional environment, comes within what is uncontrollable and spontaneous. How then, can we deal with the complexity and the risk in relationship, leveraging the transdisciplinary logic?",

      "abstract": "forkomne, who are sterkt medtatt, halvt 0delagt (av utmattelse, kulde, fattigdom, drikk ell. lign.).2 In fact, forkommenhet is probably the most obvious and idiosyncratic component of Andersen's works.3 Furthermore, as might be expected, the majority of critical studies tend to stress this issue even those whose subject is ostensibly far afield (e.g., Frik Hougen's Andersens Opplandsfort elling er) which makes it stand out all the more. None of these studies, however, attempts to determine the cause of forkommenhet ; up to now, the approaches have been largely symptomatic.4 Thus the term has taken on a considerable number of nuances, so that an individual who is called forkommen may be lonesome, isolated, alienated, rootless, sick or degenerate (physically or mentally), passe, inactive, anxious, hopeless, down-and-out, morally depraved, or a variety of these traits.5 Much as this list of qualifiers might add to the meaning of forkommenhet , it does not bring us appreciably closer to an understanding of its cause. At times, of course, the cause may be readily apparent, as when physical illness is the sole debilitating factor (e.g., in D0den ombord and Faerdig), but these cases constitute an insigificant minority. Most important, as can be seen from the descriptive list of symptoms above, forkommenhet must be defined mainly as a disease of the spirit, a pernicious state of mind caused by psychic trauma, and its etiology is by no means obvious. Clearly, this pervasive and dominating yet critically unexplained malady requires investigation. Moreover, the results should provide more than just an etiology of forkommenhet , for the issues involved concern the basic needs of every Andersen character, not just the forkomne ones.

      "title": "Bioethical troubles. Animal individuals and human organisms.",
      "abstract": "Despite the good efforts of philosophers and ethicists, many of us remain vexed by the morally complex and difficult issue of the human use of animals. We humans use animals in various contexts for diverse purposes and motives: in scientific and biomedical research; in practical therapeutic situations (medical, psychological, and social); as companions in our homes and recreational pursuits; as food on our tables and economic resources on farms; as objects of scientific, aesthetic, and practical interests in zoos and aquaria; as observed, studied, hunted, and fished in the wild; and more. We have a hard time coherently thinking through these different human-animal interactions and despair over finding any one grand ethical theory or perspective that will handle all the relevant situations and satisfy all those who recognize serious moral obligations to animals, but who are animated by different moral passions and visions.(1) Yet our ethical reflections, whatever our perspectives, are particularly bedeviled by a central and crucial issue: the nature and ethical significance of animals as genuine individuals or selves.(2) Moreover, before we can get things straight and make further progress in fixing our ethical obligations to animals and wider animate nature, we must squarely face an allied and equally elusive issue. We need to understand our own human status in the world as biological, animals organisms. Animals ethics, environmental ethics, if not human bioethics in general, await an adequate understanding of animals as individuals and humans as organisms. This is a crucial step in ethically taking humans, animals, and nature, which increasingly is becoming a central task of practical ethics. [ILLUSTRATION OMITTED] A foundation for fashioning broadly comprehensive, systematic, and coherent ethical perspectives that do justice to humans, animals, and animate nature as such lies in thinking clearly about animals as genuine individuals and valuable or ethically significant in their own right and in recognizing that human beings, no matter how sophisticated their higher capacities, are fundamentally animals, mammalian organisms, with all that this philosophically and ethically entails. To bring together and to elucidate our ethical responsibilities to humans, animals, and animate nature, we need a common philosophic understanding of individuality: its nature and ethical significance. With respect to human and animal individuals, we need to understand morally significant differences amidst morally significant similarities or commonalities. This is a daunting task given the complexity of the issue and the strong philosophic and scientific currents against which we must swim. The task calls for renewed efforts in the philosophy of nature in general and a philosophy of organic life in particular.(3) Animal and human organisms as concrete individuals--as real bodily subjects, agents, or actors carrying out their lives within the world--have had a hard time of it in modern thought, at least since the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. As psychophysical ones, with an individual integrity all their own, they have been theoretically written out of the universe. We have to jog old and fundamental philosophic habits to rehabilitate them. Yet in the name of philosophic and scientific understanding and practical ethical responsibility, this is precisely what we must do. I wish briefly to consider this rehabilitation, relying heavily on the philosophic reflections of Hans Jonas and more distantly Alfred North Whitehead,(4) and then to consider the ethical implications of this rehabilitation. Metaphysical Misadventures: The Eclipse of Organic Individuals Our modern troubles importantly began with the famous and fateful bifurcation of nature effected by the genius scientists and philosophers of sixteenth and seventeenth century Europe--the Galileos, Descarteses, and Newtons--which has dominantly influenced our Western scientific, technological, and political culture ever since. …",

Aims are broad or general statements of what you would like to achieve.Animism is the tendency to give life-like qualities to non-living things.Anonymity means not sharing someone's name.If you keep a reflective diary or write documents at work, you may be expected to anonymise your papers by using fake names, for example.Anti-discriminatory practice is a way of working that aims to challenge and diminish the causes and impact of discrimination.ix Anti-oppressive practice is a way of working that aims to reduce the structural, personal and cultural systems that create oppression.Assimilation is part of Piaget's theory of cognitive development and refers to the adaptation process that takes place when we are introduced to new ideas or experiences: instead of changing completely to accommodate the information into our ideas and schemas, we subjectively modify the information in order to fit in with our already existing ideas and schemas.Association is a term used most often by youth workers.It aims to highlight the importance of young people having a space to go to 'hang out' with their peers and some key professionals as well as to learn and engage with activities.Attachment theory is the theory that concerns the attachment between one person and another.An au pair is a young person who normally comes from a different country in order to help with childcare and housework in exchange for pocket money, food and board.Bilingual means the ability to speak two languages.A bilingual person may not necessarily be as competent in both languages.Biological construction is the notion that, for example, gender is a biological or natural occurrence.You can see the gender of someone; it is therefore determined by nature rather than made by humankind (socially constructed).Black and minority ethnic (BME) is a term used to describe people from minority groups.Minority groups within the UK consist of people who would not describe themselves as 'White British'.Boundaries determine the limits that you can go to.It gives a dividing line that should not be crossed.This dividing line separates the personal from the professional.",

      "title": "MENEMUKAN JATI DIRI DAN MENEMPATKANNYA PADA POSISINYA YANG TEPAT: Suatu Pengantar Menuju Ilmu Tasawuf",
      "abstract": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;This paper discusses how to find the identity is very important to then put it in the right position. This is based on the understanding that humans who want the happiness of the Hereafter, will take the path that is not less than six kinds of positions, namely: a diligent person, or a scientist, or a student or officer, or entrepreneur, or a person solely subjected to monotheism . Whoever has attained the most honorable degree will feel the presence of his heart with God in all things. Nothing else occurred to him, and no one else tapped his hearing, nor his views, except those charged with worship. It is not worth a person who desires this dignity to himself, then becomes lazy in his worship. Indeed, the signs of this man who attains this dignity do not occur to him in an anxious, unimaginable heart, and will not be surprised by the shock of the situation anyhow.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;Tulisan ini membahas tentang bagaimana menemukan jati diri sangat penting untuk kemudian menempatkannya pada posisi yang tepat. Hal ini berdasarkan pemahaman bahwa manusia yang menginginkan kebahagiaan akhirat, akan menempuh jalannya yang tidak kurang dari enam macam posisi yaitu : orang yang tekun beribadah, atau ilmuwan, atau pelajar (mahasiswa) atau pejabat, atau pengusaha, atau orang yang semata-mata menekuni tauhid. Barangsiapa telah mencapai derajat yang paling mulia akan merasakan kehadiran hatinya bersama dengan Allah dalam segala halnya. Tiada lagi hal lain terlintas dalam hatinya, dan tiada lagi yang mengetuk pendengarannya, maupun pandangannya, kecuali yang bermuatan ibadah. Tidak pantas sama sekali seorang yang menginginkan martabat ini pada dirinya, lalu menjadi malas ibadahnya. Sesungguhnya tanda-tanda orang yang mencapai martabat ini tidak terlintas dalam hatinya sifat kuatir, dan tidak terbayang suatu maksiat di dalam hatinya, serta tidak akan dikejutkan oleh kegoncangan situasi bagaimanapun.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;",

      "title": "Degradation of (moral) values in the context of the ego ideal and the ideal ego",
      "abstract": "All conclusions about some psychological characteristics or content must derive from relations of social, or better yet, epochal changes and structure they create. General agreement - admittedly biased and without access to a constant fact which is not close to any transitional movements - that the times are unstable - does not end with a precise understanding of how much would that instability reflect on the formation of a stable character. It could be said that this particular level of structuration, which connects 'the external' and 'the internal', is consistently absent in most theories. This especially applies to our central self, our consciousness, the authoritative part of us that sets standards and has been wrongly equated with universal truths, general principles and something that is considered to be common to all people. All complexity of formation of the super­ego, as the lastly formed instance that is also responsible for the sense of duty or the sense of moral obligation, has always been a result of the current form of structuration and has always been realized, more or less, as a distorted memory of certain, quite determined, events that a subject was overwhelmed with. If we listen to our own tendencies toward instability, we will not fall into the trap which is often present when describing ourselves, i.e. the belief that we have 'a real self', common to all human beings, whose requests are more important than requests of all others. However, outside of dynamic psychology, it would be difficult to understand how Lacan's 'split entity' could ever have 'a real self' whose requests are, especially concerning morality, more important than all other requests. Human nature has most easily been introduced into the norm by those ideals that had insisted on denial, and are located in the ego ideal. When 'ideals' moved, usually behind a screen of freedom and urge for individualization, the pleasure returned to nature in the form of ego ideals that knew the answer to the question, 'What is good for a man's life?' It is, as a reality principle, located in egocentric context, but no longer as an individual excess, but rather as a general, universal truth. Individualism, as the supreme value, has allowed different people to keep different views on what is a good life. While the ego ideal extolled people to make a compromise in which, of course, they had to forgo nature for the sake of culture, ideal ego approves all bypasses of the law if it is good for the subject. It could almost be said that the system of ego ideal, which is valued less and less, makes values as they are. There is no degradation whatsoever because cancelling of differences and boundaries leads to uniformity where the difference between the right and wrong is reduced to personal good. 'An inner voice' that dictates duties to the subject and indicates where good and evil are in opposition as pure or impure, was suspended. Ideal ego is not an ally of the law because it does not care for the subject's well-being. Unlike it, the ego ideal was giving satisfaction by its realization. No matter how strange it might seem, the highest value in a man (moral values) is most deeply associated with the lowest, with his pure nature. Therefore, it is difficult, if not impossible, to answer the question, 'What is my true self?' to a man who wonders what it is human nature. For psychoanalysis, it is hard to accept that naive 'clear understanding of self' and own values, which starts from Plato. And that was particularly difficult when, instead of compensated narcissism in the ego ideal, he continued his life in the ideal ego.",

      "abstract": "Pejorative terms, such as self-pity, dependency, manipulation, or exploitation, can be understood as descriptive of the only modes available to an individual who has repeatedly failed to elicit any appropriate responses to needs or wishes that, at the time, are salient to the strengthening of a developing or weakened self. Rather than an opportunity for structure building, failure to achieve an empathic response intensifies the driven quality of self-pity, clinging behavior, and manipulation. Self-pity, dependence, and manipulation do not represent a retreat from forbidden sexual and aggressive wishes. Freud's work emphasized the negative transference to the analyst of what was hidden from and abhorrent to the patient. It is this which makes it possible to understand the meaning of self-pity, dependence, and exploitation not as defenses against aggressive and sexual striving but as a legitimate expression of needs and wishes for selfobject experience vital to growth.",

      "title": "Norms of Trust",
      "abstract": "Norms are instructions how to act. Their form is the imperative or hypothetical imperative: ‘Do X’, ‘Don’t do X’, or ‘if Y, then do X’. There are moral norms, epistemic norms, norms of practical rationality, and social norms. In following norms we come to believe truths, to be justified in our belief, act rationally, lead a virtuous life, and act in morally permissible ways. In following social norms we come to lead a life that is acceptable to a given society, a life that conforms to this socially established way of living. Social norms thereby differ from other norms in that their prescriptions are relative rather than universal. At the most trivial level these norms can be no more than a matter of etiquette: they are a matter of adopting the right register, wearing the right clothes, or, for instance, using the outermost knife and fork first. In these matters most would accept that when in Rome one should do as the Romans do. But this easy-going relativism towards the prescriptions of social norms is not always so easy: social norms can be strongly felt. And nor are all social norms trivial: adopting the right register, for instance, can shade into treating someone the right way and thereby engage moral norms. Similarly, prescriptions of politeness can overlap with epistemic prescriptions. ‘Believe people’ might be a matter of politeness, but it could also be an epistemic norm if truth-telling were the norm. Is ‘tell the truth’ a social norm, and so the norm? Should we believe people? This chapter aims to argue that, roughly speaking, we have these social norms. It aims to offer an explanation of these social norms and an account of how this bears on epistemological theories of testimony as a source of knowledge.",

      "title": "The Essentials of an Education. (Ment. Hyg., April, 1920.) Paton, S.",
      "abstract": "The essentials of an education are: (1) a knowledge of actual life; (2) a definite impelling interest in some phase of life; (3) the recognition from actual experience of one's own capacity and limitations of adjustment; (4) the acquirement of the emotional attitudes and habits necessary for perceiving and adapting to reality. These ensure against nervous breakdown, but are not synonymous with modern education, which views the problems of man as he was or may become, not his reactions as he is. Life is a process of slow adjustment, and must be accepted as it is. If elemental biological facts are not faced squarely serious personal difficulty arises. Conflict to the point of mental depression can be so met as to preserve sound personal judgment on public questions. Individual conscious processes are not so essential to adjustment as is believed: decision is made from well grounded feeling, often not from reason which can be logically detailed. An outstanding example is Abraham Lincoln, whom science cannot explain by his heredity or early experiences. Successful life implies consciousness of the reality of environment, and avoids the visions of intemperate idealism. The student is not taught to know himself, to estimate the present, and to intelligently adjust to immediate circumstances.

      "abstract": "Kuhse wrote that killing is not always morally worse than letting die and sometimes may be better.(205) She argued that active euthanasia is morally no worse than passive euthanasia and sometimes morally better. This, she stated, is based on the motivation of the agent, as the two acts have the same outcome. The actors, parents and physicians believe they are doing good, which, in itself, is based on the notion that the outcome, death, is good, or much better, than the alternative, a life with severe disability. Although the moral notion, in some circumstances, may be seen by some as acceptable, it is based on an abstraction akin to the legal term non actus reus nisi mens sit rea (knowledge of the wrongfulness of an act at the time of its commission) and in the case of foregoing life-sustaining treatment for an extremely preterm infant, is not a verifiable proposition. Whereas the actors may believe they are doing good, this is based on their perceptions and judgments, which have been molded by anecdote, bias, prejudice, custom, and taboo. For example, it was not that long ago that children with Down syndrome were left to die from conditions that were correctable. Recent history is replete with acts performed by professionals that at the time were not believed by them to be bad but would be judged as such now.",

Among serious offenders, self-justification in terms of having no choice is more common or the hapless claim that \"I don't know why I did that\" or even \"I can't believe I did that\" (which all too often becomes \"I can't remember doing that\" for as Nietzche (1886) wrote \"I have done that—says my memory. I could not have done that—says my pride and remains inexorable. Eventually memory gives in\"). Those who do appeal to principle to justify their evil actions almost inevitably cite value systems that have considerable, if not universal, acceptance. I have encountered men who proudly declared their killings to be part of the pursuit of righteous aims, such as protecting children from pedophiles, stopping the killing of the unborn child, reducing AIDS, and cleansing their city of vice. Interestingly the combination of dreadful, and in many cases repeated, violence with self-righteous superiority often attracts from fellow prisoners and prison staff a label of evil.",

What has not been recognized, or at least not accorded any significance, is that for Socrates virtue is an aim. He believes that you should never aim simply at saving your life at the expense of aiming at what is virtuous; in other words, your life counts for nothing as an aim when compared with virtue as an aim. But “the supremacy of virtue” does not imply the quite implausible view that many readers apparently attribute to Socrates, that one's loss of life is not relevant to the deliberation about what is in fact the virtuous action in some circumstances; that is, the view that one's life counts for nothing in a different sense. It is not as though one could determine what the virtuous action is independently of considerations of life, death, pleasure, pain, or material loss or gain. Socrates is not saying that we should ignore these things absolutely. Any fact described in non-evaluative terms may in principle be relevant in a deliberation that seeks to determine what the virtuous action is here and now. Certainly factors like pleasure and pain, life and death, wealth, and the welfare of friends and family will be most relevant to such deliberations. We must ignore such things, however, as aims of action when they conflict with what virtue requires.",

Learning from punishment, including badmouth, is impossible in harsh environments, where agents do not survive rejections received. Imitation is indispensable, but what to imitate? Frequent behaviors are not necessarily socially desirable, neither fitness observable. In this paper, agents meeting infrequent but lethal food scarcity survive thanks to food sharing. Saving recipients from certain death, donations reduce altruists' lifetime. Results show that prudent donors, helping only when above starvation point, are exploited by cheaters and soon extinguish. The same happens with agents taking reciprocity into account, and helping only when their credits are turned off. Instead, agents endowed with dynamic goals (survival vs. giving help) learn even the most unconditioned form of altruism, thus avoiding extinction. Tentative conclusions are discussed. Among others, dynamic goal-directed agents are autonomous entities learning even the most generous forms of altruism. Moreover, prudence is not necessarily more adaptive than unconditioned altruism; indeed, it may be self-defeating under given conditions.Request access from your librarian to read this chapter's full text.",

Many animals (invertebrates, very young or very old animals) as well as some humans (infants, severely impaired individuals) do not conform to them. To provide an alternative model, animal ethics can be rooted in vulnerability as foundational ethical category. Instead of cognitive capacities that occasionally form a high threshold for a moral status, the universally shared dependency and injurability of bodily beings comes to the fore. However, vulnerability is not a mere fact but socially mediated. Any kind of perception of vulnerability – and of responsiveness to it – are predetermined by a selective moral infrastructure that reveals certain vulnerabilities (e.g. of companion animals) while concealing others (e.g. livestock animals). Yet we are not fully determined by this infrastructure and can criticize hegemonic frames of perceiving and treating animals though we are never outside those structures that frame animals.",

      "title": "Discrimination Forms in the Professional Area 1",
      "abstract": "Relevant theoretical background for approaching the discrimination phenomenonDiscrimination (Latin discriminatio - separation) a concept closely related to the one of difference. The original meaning of separation has the significance of a neutral act, even a passive one of establishing a difference - which closely linked to the identification process. Territoriality the one determining individuals to notice the presence of a different being in their proximity and, in the identification process, to adopt an attitude against this being, either aggressive or non-aggressive. Hence, when a group, irrespective of the species, uses elements/signals of identification between its members and ones of differentiation against one or more individuals for adopting a certain delimitation attitude, we deal with discriminatory behaviour, which does not presuppose moral connotation. Thus, identity represents a posture adopted for the duration of an interaction, a possibility of an individual, (or of a group of individuals) to organise relationships against one another (...) From this perspective, the individual not perceived as determined by his belonging because he the one which gives a significance to the latter! (Ogien, 1987, p. 135)In the fifties, under the influence of social movements, the negative connotation developed with respect to the term of discrimination. The initial, neutral meaning, synonymous with the distinction, took over a pejorative connotation. Now, it about differentiation actions either abusively or illegally, by separating a social group and treating another in a disfavouring manner, one way or the other. At the same time, the term of non-discrimination emerges, with the entire associated conceptualisation.There are differences in the social contexts in which individuals practicing discrimination function. In the case of Europe, we might talk about a shared common definition of discrimination, and of its institutionalisation/regulation by laws, actions of repression taken by authorities against discriminatory acts. However, there are outside the democratic states, governments openly legitimising, in the name of morality, religion, or ideology, forms that we call discrimination. Examples therefore are the laws limiting fundamental liberties of women, or that deny the rights of indigenous people; it a type of discrimination depriving de facto individuals from the viewpoint of human rights. As result, defining discrimination related closely to the values of the societies. Some individuals may be discriminated based on the complex of elements constituting their identity, such as the case of an indigenous woman - she can be discriminated as woman, but also as person belonging to the indigenous populations.According to the sociologist Mihailescu loan (1993), discrimination represents difference, restriction, exclusion, preference or differing treatment which disadvantages an individual/group, as compared to others in the same situations, or the use of unequal treatment against a person or against a group of persons in relationship with other categorical features: racial, ethnic or religious belonging, or class attachment. The term is used for describing the action of a dominant majority in relationship with a minority and involves a prejudice caused to an individual or to a (Mihailescu I., in Zamfir and Vlasceanu, 1993, p. 177).The discrimination represents, consequently, the differentiated treatment applied to an individual by its inclusion into a certain social group. Discrimination an individual action, but if the members of the same group are treated similarly, then it represents a social model of collective behaviour (Banton, 1998). In social sciences, the term refers to the differentiated treatment against the large majority, with negative effects on the individual exposed to it.The United Nations Organisation includes in discrimination any conduct based on the distinction operated in relationship with certain natural and social categories and which not related to the individual capacities and merits, or to the actual behaviour of an individual. …",

It declares that eating, drinking, dressing and benefitting from all kinds of benefactions are lawful, but it’s necessary to give upall immoderations and Allah does not like immoderates.Islam which forbids all kinds of immodera-tion has found a special solution to it; it ordered “moderation” as a remedy for it. “Moderation” has also got some general meanings as well as narrow ones. In general it means to be temperate in all sorts of habits and actions; and in nar-row sense it means thriftiness in spending money etc. Qoran orders neither to be niggard as someone who “his hand was shackled to the neck” nor “to squander” to make the parent hungry and needy; but to be “just mean between those (two extremes)” and to be in the same way at spending on the others too. By applying the general meaning every thing will be kept on temperance in; material and spiritual life; physical, spiritual, material etc. abilities will be temperate. By the application of narrow meaning, necessities and enjoyments will be satisfied temperately and so, by using them usefully and in necessity, the material substances will be kept as an asset that everybody can use them. It is clear that the immoderation, extreme actions and wastefully spendings cause spiritual and material corraptions. The statistical informations about these subjects are neither pleasant for our country nor for rest of the world. To conclude, persons and communities have to endeavour to eliminate “immoderation” and make the “moderation” a life-style habit in its place. This is more useful for everybody and everything in the world.",

      "title": "The invisibility cloak illusion: People (incorrectly) believe they observe others more than others observe them.",
      "abstract": "Whether at a coffee shop, in a waiting room, or riding the bus, people frequently observe the other people around them. Yet they often fail to realize how much other people engage in the same behavior, and that they, therefore, also are being observed. Because it is logically impossible that people, on average, are the subjects of observation more than they are objects of it, the belief that one watches others more than one is watched is an illusion. Several studies show that people incorrectly believe that they observe others more than other people observe them. We call this mistaken belief the \"invisibility cloak illusion.\" People believe that they observe others more than do other people and that they are generally observed less than are others (Studies 1-3, 5, 6). The illusion persists both among strangers in the same vicinity (Study 2) and among friends interacting with one another (Study 3), and it cannot be explained away as yet another general better-than-average bias nor is it the result of believing one has more thoughts, in general, than do other people (Studies 2-3). The illusion is supported by a failure to catch others watching oneself (Studies 1b, 4) and it is manifest in the specific contents of people's thoughts about one another (Studies 5 and 6). Finally, rendering a feature of one's appearance salient to oneself fails to interrupt the illusion despite increasing one's belief that others are paying more attention specifically to that salient feature (Study 6).

      "title": "A Genealogy of the Sin of Sloth - or Why We Neglect Social and Economic Rights (La Paresse du Droit ou Pourquoi Neglige-t-on les Droits Sociaux et Economiques)",
      "abstract": "This paper argues that the sin of sloth (acedia), as understood by the Christian tradition, has been replaced by its opposite in the modern world. Sloth, according to Aquinas, is the sin of the soul that does not act for the good in itself, that does not act out of love for God, but rather, that acts merely on the basis of fear or out of a desire to gain benefits. The slothful person was the one who acted (or did not act...) according to his or her own calculated interests instead of acting according to his or her telos. Thus, total inaction from the slothful sinner came from his or her belief that he or she was lost and that nothing he or she could do could save him or her. Inaction was thus considered incidental to, a mere symptom of, one's dispersion of will. The modern conception of sloth tends to reverse this scheme by focusing instead on the unresponsiveness to incentives. Not following one's telos appears to have nothing to do with the modern conception of sloth. Inaction is considered rational if an agent is not subject to appropriate incentives to act (i.e. the potential to gain benefits or avoid losses through action). In effect, acting without the appropriate incentives only means spending irrationally one's energies, it means being wasteful. At the opposite, inaction is considered slothful when the agent does not take positive steps to materialise potential gains or to avoid potential losses. The structure of modern law reflects the inversion of meaning that struck sloth when we moved from the Medieval man to the homo economicus. This inversion of meaning explains to a large extent the attitude that a majority of jurists have about social and economic rights: if those rights are not justiciable, they are not real rights, they impose no duty, people are thus not bound by them, thus, they are not real law. Through a genealogy of the sin of sloth, this paper offers a criticism of this dominant mode of legal thinking.",

      "title": "Forgiveness and psychological therapy",
      "abstract": "People sometimes suffer psychological trauma because they have been wronged. A victim of wrongdoing may be angry, afraid, hurt and resentful; as a result, the victim may feel violated. Perceived wrongs may also make a victim feel violated. One issue that victims often have difficulty in coming to terms with is why they were wronged. The question has to do with making sense of – that is, finding out the reason for – what happened to them. Those who already have low self-esteem (that is, a misplaced or diminished sense of self-regard, self-confidence and self-respect and an inaccurate perception of themselves as rational and relational human beings) may find it particularly difficult to forgive (Novitz 1998: 311–13) – or may ‘forgive’ all too easily out of a lack of self-respect. With some types of wrongdoing, the victim may feel that the wrongdoer is implicitly communicating that the victim is worthless, a ‘thing’ (not a person) to be abused at will. Being wronged can be a psychologically destructive experience for a person, and can have harmful effects on the lives of others and even on communities.",

      "title": "The Virtues of Common Pursuit",
      "abstract": "When we think about being good, morally good that is, what comes to mind is being good to others, and in less definite, though still important way, being good to ourselves. One set of virtues which comes into consideration are generosity, beneficence, and justice, with the focus perhaps, on welfare and rights. In Hume's words, a mind will never be able to bear its own survey, that has been wanting in its part to mankind and society.' In less definite way, virtues benefit self too (as Hume himself argues), and some benefit self directly, even though those same virtues may on other occasions be directed toward others. An individual may act with courage in the face of horrible disease or in circumstances which threaten morale and make suicide seem an attractive escape. Non-deception, temperance, and respect each can focus on self in ways that are morally admirable and praiseworthy. Equally, virtues focused on others may be said to have indirect benefit to their possessors, in the sense that they enhance their moral perfection. Put differently, we tend to think of virtues as self and other-regarding, and indeed in general, think of morality as matter of how we attend to individuals, whether it be ourselves or others, and in the case of others, strangers or loved ones, sometimes with regard to numbers, sometimes not. The preoccupation in contemporary moral literature with self/other asymmetries, with perspectives that break away from the agent neutrality of consequentialism, presuppose the same general worries about what we owe self and what we owe other.2 Appeal to the importance of giving due regard, sometimes moral, sometimes prudential, to self in distinction from others again echoes that",

Learning from punishment, including badmouth, is impossible in harsh environments, where agents do not survive rejections received. Imitation is indispensable, but what to imitate? Frequent behaviors are not necessarily socially desirable, neither fitness observable. In this paper, agents meeting infrequent but lethal food scarcity survive thanks to food sharing. Saving recipients from certain death, donations reduce altruists’ lifetime. Results show that prudent donors, helping only when above starvation point, are exploited by cheaters and soon extinguish. The same happens with agents taking reciprocity into account, and helping only when their credits are turned off. Instead, agents endowed with dynamic goals (survival vs. giving help) learn even the most unconditioned form of altruism, thus avoiding extinction. Tentative conclusions are discussed. Among others, dynamic goal-directed agents are autonomous entities learning even the most generous forms of altruism. Moreover, prudence is not necessarily more adaptive than unconditioned altruism; indeed, it may be self-defeating under given conditions.",

This chapter continues to flesh out his moral philosophy. To avoid confusion with “action” in Spinoza’s technical sense of the word (3D2), the author uses “deed” when speaking of actions in our ordinary sense. By “deed” is meant an individual’s voluntary behavior—that is, behavior that results from an individual’s desires, emotions, and beliefs regardless of whether the desires and emotions are active or passive and regardless of whether the beliefs are adequate or inadequate. In contrast with the underivative goodness of wellness and the underivative badness of illness, this chapter shows that Spinoza is committed to the derivative goodness and derivative badness of deeds and of spatially external objects.",

For people absorbed in mourning, cases of depression, or people with autistic characteristics, the perception of movements that are too rapid or unpredictable and displacements can cause spatial fears that make them unavailable for the relation. Identification and relationship become possible if the therapist is attuned to their rhythm, usually very slow and delicate. Comments on the interior experiences also help to regulate experiences that are too intense or fracturing, either at a sensory, emotional, or relationship level. For people that are somehow “transparent” and cannot manifest themselves, the reactions are first delayed, before they become synchronized.",

Many people were unable to realize their values in action and found them continuing in the experiment even though they disagreed with what they were doing. Some people treat systems of human origin as if they existed above and beyond any human agent, beyond the control of whim or human feeling.

      "abstract": "The totality of moral rules truly forms about each person an imaginary wall, at the foot of which the flood of human passions simply dies without being able to go further. For the same reason – that they are contained – it becomes possible to satisfy them. But if at any point this barrier weakens, these previously restrained human forces pour tumultuously through the open breach; once loosed they find no limits where they can stop. They can only devote themselves, without hope of satisfaction, to the pursuit of an end that always eludes them. For example, if the rules of the conjugal morality lose their authority, and the mutual obligations of husband and wife become less respected, the emotions and appetites ruled by this sector of morality will become unrestricted and uncontained, and accentuated by this very release; powerless to fulfil themselves because they have been freed from all limitations, these emotions will produce a disillusionment which manifests itself visibly in the statistics of suicide. In the same way, should the morality governing economic life be shaken, and the search for gain become excited and inflamed beyond bounds, then one would observe a rise in the annual quota of suicides. One could multiply such examples. Furthermore, it is because morality has the function of limiting and containing that too much wealth so easily becomes a source of immorality. Through the power wealth confers on us, it actually diminishes the power of things to oppose us. Consequently, it lends strength to our desires and makes it harder to hold them in check.",

More specifically, Rawls proposes that the interests of a self, which are not necessarily interests in oneself, are not merely determined by her tastes and preferences or her pains and pleasures. Her interests are instead determined by her conception of the good, which is the consistent and coherent plan of life she would choose under favorable conditions, with full information after careful reflection (TJ 358).",

Of course being tolerant of others and rendering due respect to them are not equivalent. The latter comprehends a far wider range of attitudes and actions towards others than the former does, but I am inclined to think that all that having a tolerant regard towards others involves will be part of granting them the respect which is their due. That is, all failures in tolerance will be failures in respect, but not vice versa. I am not able to say clearly what subclass of, loosely, attitudes and actions constitutive of respect for others comprises being tolerant of them. Tolerance appears largely to take as its target beliefs and attitudes of others which form their conception of the great ends and proper conduct of life, and actions so far as these are exhibitive of or consequent upon these beliefs and attitudes. Respect clearly extends additionally to cover for instance respect for the physical integrity of another as such. This indicated demarcation is, of course, extremely vague, but, fortunately, nothing in what I want to go on to consider depends upon getting this more precise.",

      "abstract": "Human beings are unique in their ability to think consciously about themselves. Because they have a capacity for self-awareness not shared by other animals, people can imagine themselves in the future, anticipate consequences, plan ahead, improve themselves, and perform many other behaviors that are uniquely characteristic of human beings. Yet, despite the obvious advantages of self-reflection, the capacity for self-thought comes at a high price as people's lives are adversely affected and their inner chatter interferes with their success, pollutes their relationships, and undermines their happiness. Indeed, self-relevant thought is responsible for most of the personal and social difficulties that human beings face as individuals and as a species. Among other things, the capacity for self-reflection distorts people's perceptions, leading them to make bad decisions based on faulty information. The self conjures up a great deal of personal suffering in the form of depression, anxiety, anger, envy, and other negative emotions by allowing people to ruminate about the past or imagine the future. Egocentrism and egotism blind people to their own shortcomings, promote self-serving biases, and undermine their relationships with others. The ability to self-reflect also underlies social conflict by leading people to separate themselves into ingroups and outgroups. Ironically, many sources of personal unhappiness — such as addictions, overeating, unsafe sex, infidelity, and domestic violence — are due to people's inability to exert self-control. For those inclined toward religion and spirituality, visionaries throughout history have proclaimed that the egoic self stymies the quest for spiritual fulfillment and leads to immoral behavior.",

Sometimes the purely play-motive is joined by a feature of something like sport, and the child tries to surpass his own or others' performances: to jump a little higher or farther, to stand still longer on one leg, and to utter louder shouts. The simplest playthings are objects left unchanged in their original form and only used as auxiliary to the aforementioned body-games: as when the child thumps on the table with a lump of wood to satisfy his craving for movement and his hunger for noise-stimulus. The part played by imitation in constructive games is evidently greater in the case of girls than with boys. Some children refused to play poverty of ideas of their own, or incapacity to carry on the game without help from playfellows.",

And despite his intention, he may never build a squirrel house, try to build a squirrel house, or do anything whatever with the intention of getting a squirrel house built. Pure intending of this kind, intending that may occur without practical reasoning, action, or consequence, poses a problem if we want to give an account of the concept of intention that does not invoke unanalysed episodes or attitudes like willing, mysterious acts of the will, or kinds of causation foreign to science. When action is added to intention, for example when someone nails two boards together with the intention of building a squirrel house, then it may at first seem that the same problem does not necessarily arise.",

However, excessive earnestness is not necessarily repellent, and, as his biographer, I have adopted a neutral or non-critical approach when assessing his gestures at humour or his awkwardly playful relations with others. I have also tried to give him due credit for the successful construction of a personality open to feelings and sociability, qualities that were often missing in members of his family and in many of his acquaintances. While most people can be said to naturally possess a personality, Spencer consciously contrived one. This was a defensive move on his part; he was excessively sensitive and needed to fortify himself with the only capacity he possessed in abundance: the ability to scrutinize his own psyche and those of others. His personality, like his writings, was a creative achievement that gave him the standing to interact successfully with strangers. Since Spencer was aware of his limitations when relating to others, this also provided him with an analytical tool to compare the desires and sentiments of other individuals and societies with his own feelings. This was never cold; his psychological analysis did not reduce people to objective and impersonal data with no connection to himself.",

As with demand, there may seem to be a problem in maintaining that it is possible for people to supply esteem in this way. After all, I cannot make a gift of my esteem, nor can I offer it in a trade with another person, nor can I pass on the esteem I receive from others. But while esteem itself may not be alienable in these ways, certain ‘esteem-services’ are: I can voluntarily offer you my attention, my testimony, and my company, and do so in a way that promises to increase your positive esteem. And I can do this without self-defeat so far as I can hide my motives or, more plausibly, can do so in a virtually but not actually strategic way: I give my attention, testimony or association quite spontaneously but will be led to think again if it fails to secure suitable reciprocation.",

      "title": "Inverse Psychological Projection",
      "abstract": "Potential competing interests: No potential competing interests to declare.Freud (1894) defined \"psychological projection\" as a defense mechanism in which one attributes negative aspects of their personality to others and is thus able to ignore their own flaws and problems.Its inverse form is defined as follows: when a person repeatedly (sometimes angrily) advises another person to ignore or pay no attention to either someone or something, it is usually because the person who advises this is experiencing inverse psychological projection; that is, if this person's needs have been disregarded in the past, their experience will be reflected in their reaction to the person they advise.However, such advice is relevant only when the type of hurt is a very specific case of banal mockery.If a mentally ill person tells somebody they are ugly, the best advice is to ignore them.However, if this person hurts someone in a way that has nothing to do with banal mockery of self-image (e.g., public humiliation, contempt, invasion of privacy, incitement, threatening behavior, discrimination, abuse, sexual or ordinary harassment, violence, annoyance) or if what was said had already hurt the other, then advising them to ignore or pay no attention to that mentally ill person disregards this damage.This defense mechanism can be activated in a person if they have been unable to cope with similar types of hurt in their own past and have been exposed to related mental damage, if their egoism is stimulated by the same matter, or if, due to this stimulation, it is either shameful for them to acknowledge their egoism because stimulated (or vulnerable) egoism is considered socially inferior or difficult for them to contain the other's hurt feelings or bruised egoism.Consequently, they deny the problem's existence and thus advise others to also ignore it due to their will to either stimulate (and unburden) their antagonism to others or to demonstrate their ability to rise above the same issue and \"win\" against it.Moreover, in contrast to classic psychological projection, in which a person attributes negative aspects of their own personality to others when they are unable to deal with these aspects (so they can ignore them), in its inverse form, a person attributes the quality that they would like to but cannot demonstrate/be able to succeed in (which relates to their ability to efficiently manage things or problems that stimulate their own egoism), so they can avoid dealing with these things or problems.In similar scenarios, inverse psychological projection may include saying things such as \"I don't care what you think (or say)/Who cares what people think (or say),\" \"Don't get excited by the background noise,\" I will not stoop to your level,\" \"Don't let them influence you,\" \"Don't give them the satisfaction,\" \"Don't give them a platform,\" \"They aren't worth it,\" or \"What do you expect from him?\" (one must distinguish between \"expected to\" and \"predicted to\" as these two possess different responsibilities).Alternatively, when discussing a television show, one may say, \"Who even watches it?\"and in",

One possible exception is that it is doubted we have equal moral obligations to all humans indifferently. We have special obligations to our children and other family members, and more to our friends and our countrymen than to others. We have obligations to the starving poor in Africa, but charity begins at home. Metaethically, the Darwinian can offer no justification. That would be to violate the naturalistic fallacy, going from claims about matters to claims about values. For the Darwinian the world has not intrinsic value. This means that the Darwinian is a moral non-realist. It does not mean they have no substantive ethics, but that these are psychological not grounded in external supports, natural or non-natural (like Platonic forms or the will of God). We objectify morality, thinking substantive claims do have support, are objective, otherwise we would all begin to cheat and the whole system breaks down. Ultimately, however, face to face, Darwinism demands a dramatic rethinking of common sense and the assumption of the ages, at least in western civilization.",

Ordinary motives fall neither under the one head nor the other. They are interests in the attainment of objects, without which it seems to the man in his actual state that he cannot satisfy himself, and in attaining which, because he has desired them, he will find a certain pleasure, but only because he has previously desired them, not because pleasures are the objects desired.(Green, Prolegomena to Ethics, Sect. 160.)",

A can be the agent and the only agent for that task, and hence her unique identity as the deliverer is uncontroversial. Because she is both necessary and sufficient, she may find her role ethically demanding in two senses. Not only must she deliver but she can also deliver by herself. When things develop, this twofold responsibility may become less clear. A may no longer be sufficient, perhaps she needs to coordinate with other agents, yet she is still necessary, sometimes even more so than in the past.",

Usually, the ‘self’ in question is the individual person, but the concept has also been applied to corporate bodies held to possess a unitary identity. What constitutes the self’s ‘real nature’ is the key variable generating the many conceptions of self-realization. These can be grouped broadly into two types: (1) the ‘collectivist’, in which the self-realizing lifestyle, being either the same for all or specific to a person or subgroup of people, is ultimately definable only in the context, and perhaps with reference to the common purposes, of a collective social body; (2) the ‘individualist’, in which a person’s self-realization has no necessary connection with the ends of a particular community. As an ethic, self-realization can be proposed as the means to achieve a life identified as good by some criterion independent of the self-realizing process, or held to be that which actually defines the good. Its critics typically argue that human nature is such that any equation of ‘self-realization’ and ‘goodness’ is implausible or undesirable.",

This is puzzling because one can only sin by doing something else and, prima face , Jesus can do actions that you or I could do by which we would sin. I suggest that appearances to the contrary, Jesus cannot do a variety of actions that a merely human duplicate could do. His doing sinful actions is compossible with a range of empirical facts about his physical abilities and circumstances of the sort we ordinarily take into account in assessing what a person can do, but not with a wider range of theological facts concerning his divinity. Like Tim, Lewis’s time-traveler, who can kill Grandfather relative to facts about his immediate circumstances and abilities but not relative to a wider range of facts, Jesus ‘can’ in the ordinary sense sin, though he will not, but relative to a wider range of facts which obtain in virtue of his divinity, cannot.",

      "abstract": "The environmental crisis in human dignity lies not just in the overuse, the misuse, and the decay of physical settings, but far more significantly in how we conceive of the individual in relation to any such setting. In the design and organization of physical settings, the human properties of the individual are ignored, oversimplified, or implicitly assumed, because of the influence of such socioenvironmental values as scientific‐technological progress, urbanism, pseudoprogress (novelty and change), and the value placed on an ever increasing acceleration of technological change. Spaces and places are improperly designed not only in physical terms; designs overlook human needs for privacy, territoriality, freedom of choice, etc., and the conceiving of the individual as a simple “machine man.” Unintended consequences are often ignored and no attempt is made to evaluate just how well the setting actually works. The danger is that the person will adjust and at the price of a continuing erosion of the properties that make him distinctively human. It is imperative that as behavioral scientists turn to the systematic study of man/environment problems they recognize the need to maintain the contextual reality and integrity of any such problem as it evolves, develops, and becomes modified in the time framework of a complex society.",

      "title": "The Inevitable Pursuit of the Will and the Problem of Merit According to Thomas Aquinas",
      "abstract": "Man's will necessarily pursues what is in accordance with its nature, and accidentally pursues what does not. Since the will pursues whatever it does in accordance with the good or ultimate purpose, it inevitably pursues formal good in general or the ultimate purpose. And the will inevitably pursues existence, preservation of life, social cooperation, and the pursuit of truth according to man's nature. The methods for realizing these goals are chosen haphazardly. However, when the ends according to these natures are in conflict with each other, the will chooses and pursues one by chance. In particular, in the case of the ultimate goal, it includes not only the aspect of self-completion but also the method of realization, and the will has freedom of execution regarding which method of realization the ultimate goal includes. The will can pursue or reject an ultimate goal whose method of realization is worldly values such as pleasure or wealth, or an ultimate goal whose method of realization is goodness itself. In this way, the ultimate goal that the will knows with freedom of execution is inevitably pursued. Because the will has freedom of action in knowing this ultimate end, these activities can be the object of moral merit. Obtaining faith by God's grace and achieving beatific vision in heaven are also inevitably accepted by the will when God's help is provided. When the grace of faith is given, it cannot be refused, and the will cannot be given freedom of action when preparing to accept it. The human will cannot exercise any freedom of choice or action under these conditions. So, although ‘free will in a broad sense’ can be recognized in the will, it is difficult to give merit to such activities. In heaven, the beatified person does not reject the beatific vision but inevitably pursues it because he has a firm inclination toward goodness. However, in order for the beatified person to have a firm inclination toward goodness, a person must have faith and make efforts in accordance with the correct ultimate goal in this life. The virtue achieved through such efforts in this life is not only the grace of God, but also the freedom of practice as ‘free will in a narrow sense’. These activities can be a contribution to the beatific vision achieved in the afterlife. The degree of supernatural virtue and beatific intuition of the beatified person in heaven varies depending on the grace given initially and the merits formed afterwards.",

However, documentation stresses on the responsibility of the observer for her or his observation, descriptions, interpretations and explanations.

By contrast, it is mainly about trying to see and understand what is going on in the pedagogical work and what the child is capable of without any predetermined framework of expectations and norms. Processes of observation and documentation are never objective and hence not neutral. Objectivity is a subject's false view that observing can take place without him. We have to realize and admit that documentation always holds our own subjective feelings, wishes and values which should not be seen as something negative but rather as something positive, not something to avoid but rather to understand how these enter into the process of documentation.",

In such artworks, I argue, drug experiences are encoded: their drug-related contextual and intrinsic properties or content are aesthetically or artistically relevant and should be mentioned in any in-depth analysis. I then further argue that it is impossible or at least very difficult to fully appreciate or produce optimal evaluations of a high artwork, unless one has oneself had drug-induced experiences of the kind encoded in the work. This is because such experiences afford one the relevant phenomenal knowledge that is otherwise inaccessible, yet required to gain an adequate level of competence allowing one to fully grasp the work.",

What is less unclear is a certain uneasiness or even dissatisfaction with merely satisfying one's immediate needs.2 Hence, questions such as: what makes us truly human? is life worth living? is there a purpose to life? are asked. Humans, apparently unlike other living beings, can and sometimes do wonder about the significance of being alive and interacting with others. A specifically human concern is whether life itself has any ultimate meaning. It would be naive to think that we humans always ask these questions in such an explicit way. Nor do we address the issue of ultimate meaning with uniform concern and interest. Our list of priorities in life would hardly reveal such in-depth existential values. In fact, we generally set ourselves certain goals, strive after them, and, if we attain them, look for others.3 Nonetheless, the question as to whether life has any meaning at all is a human one not only because, as far as we know, humans alone are capable of reflecting on it, but also because every human being-although in most cases implicitly rather than explicitly?is confronted by it.4 As a matter of fact, we more or less presume the meaningfulness of life by carrying on with our daily routine. We assume that there is some sense to life by engaging in the various",

      "abstract": "It is emphasized, that by known reliable news it is appropriate to understand those, that fully correspond to the actual circumstances of the action (actions or inactions of an individual or a small group of people), events (actions or inactions of very large groups of people, when it is impossible to establish the role in achieving the overall result of each of participants, for example, in the course of the war, etc.) or phenomenon (action or inaction of the forces of nature, including predatory animals, that are in conditions not regulated by humans) in general or a certain part of it, and peculiarities of perception, memorization, their storage, reproduction and other transmissions by a certain person, including life experience or relevant special or professional competence contribute to the transmission or other disclosure of practically adequate news. Attention is focused on the fact, that according to the basic orientation of the result of their public disclosure, each of the named types of news can be divided into those, that condition their perception by the majority of addressees as positive, negative and positive-negative, and negative information – also as neutral, socially harmful and socially dangerous news, when the last two types of news, depending on the level of public danger as a result of their public disclosure, may create conditions for the recipients to commit relevant criminal and other offences. On the basis of the above, it is proposed to improve the constitutional foundations of the legitimate implementation of any type of juridical, journalistic and other mass media proving or public discussion in terms of the freedom of not just any, but only knowingly reliable speech, as well as specified circumstances under which publication may be limited and knowingly reliable news.",

      "abstract": "The paper argues that the final value of an object—i.e., its value for its own sake—need not be intrinsic. Extrinsic final value, which accrues to things (or persons) in virtue of their relational rather than internal features, cannot be traced back to the intrinsic value of states that involve these things together with their relations. On the contrary, such states, insofar as they are valuable at all, derive their value from the things involved. The endeavour to reduce thing-values to state-values is largely motivated by a mistaken belief that appropriate responses to value must consist in preferring and/or promoting. A pluralist approach to value analysis obviates the need for reduction: the final value of a thing or person can be given an independent interpretation in terms of the appropriate thing- or person-oriented responses: admiration, love, respect, protection, care, cherishing, etc.",

Dugas calls intimidation, to distuinguish it from reflective timidity, is ' due to the distress arising from the realization of the lack of sympathy between ourselves and our environment.'Reflection is apt to create a certain exaggeration of this feeling, so that the person affected ' begins to despise himself, to exaggerate his perplexities, and to pet his anger.'He is apt to isolate himself intellectually.While his thinking may be original, it will lack social adaptiveness.On the affective side there is a tendency to conceal sentiments of his own, and to distrust the sympathy of others.Hence the reserve that is characteristic of timidity.He may be further affected by a certain maladie d'iddal, or tendency to despise the things of ordinary life in comparison with his fancies.On the volitional side his acts are apt to be impulsive, and are often incomprehensible to himself, mainly because he no longer has the power of deliberate judgment.Finally, in its spontaneous form timidity marks a normal state in mental growth, that stands midway between the pure reflex life of the child and reflective mental life.Between the more abnormal form and genius a possible relation is suggested.The exclusiveness which the timide seeks, while it cannot of itself inspire art, may give occasion for its development.",

Many have died for an emotional commitment, including officials who remained loyal to a defeated country, martyrs who refused to bow in the face of intimidation, chivalrous knights-errant, elopers who defied society (1), in short, people who sacrificed their lives for an ideal, making no calculation of personal gain or loss in the process. Others lean toward rationality, examining principles and analyzing nagging questions, evaluating the appropriateness of names and their correspondence with the realities to which they are attached. Such people are exemplified by the rational approach to principle and [the Classics taken during the Sung] and by philosophers. If one follows pure emotions. then all matters might be honorable and virtuous, but implicit is the defect of stupidity. If one follows a pure rationality, then all things might be understood and put in order, but implicit is the defect of distortion.

For example, even though Dee is unable to report the size, shape, or orientation of an object, she can pick up that object just as well as someone with normal vision. For example, as she reaches out to grasp an object the opening of her hand is scaled to the object’s size – and she rotates her hand in flight so that it is aligned properly with the object. This suggests that the visual control of skilled actions may depend on brain pathways that are independent of those supporting visual perception.",

Substandard structures are erected, and collapse, with loss of lives. Doctors in intensive care units fail to wash their hands between patients, and contribute to the problem of cross-infection. There are many situations like these in which harm flows from an action which, in contrast to an error, is quite deliberate in its conceptualisation and execution, even though no harm was intended. We have said that errors are entirely involuntary. The moral implications of an injury are quite different if some element of choice by the actor was involved in the actions which led to its causation. A mistake (mistakes being that subset of errors in which the flaw lies in the decision or plan) is defined as an error precisely because the actor believes that the action is an appropriate way of achieving an objective safely. He or she is acting in good faith, trying to do the best possible thing, but failing. A decision or plan can no longer be considered a mistake (or any other kind of error under the definition in chapter 3) if the person concerned knows that there is a more acceptable alternative, or an alternative more likely to achieve the given objective safely, and yet deliberately chooses the less satisfactory alternative.",

For example, it is through the orientation of the body and, especially, through the orientation of the eyes, that information is provided about the direction and nature of a person's attention. How people arrange their bodies and how they orient them and place them in relation to each other or to features in the environment, provides important information about how they are engaged with one another and about the nature of their intentions and attitudes. Activities in which objects in the environment are being manipulated, modified or rearranged, are indispensable for grasping a person's aims and goals and interests. Of equal importance, however, are actions that are seen to be purely expressive. Here we find those configurations of action in the face and body that appear as displays of feeling and emotion, as well as actions that often play a central role in the accomplishment of important moments in social interaction. Greeting, showing gratitude or affection, challenge, threat, submission, compliance, all are accomplished through a range of different expressive actions.",

      "title": "The Leader-Follower Connection",
      "abstract": "(Figure 1) The \"absence of leadership\"' has become a convenient excuse for all of the shortcomings of the nursing profession.Leadership is about power. And it may be that we have misread the nature of power, thereby misjudging roles and relationships and compromising our ability to take charge of our own future. Power has to be understood as the product of social relationships. Power is given or it does not exist. Sometimes it is given freely, sometimes coercively; often it is withheld as a demonstration of defiance. Power may be awarded by a system, it may be a personal attribute, or it may be shared by those who possess it with those they wish to empower. The underlying principles of power and its connection to leadership are abstract, but the proofs are within the personal experiences of each of us. We have known the manager who finds it difficult or impossible to move an agenda despite being in a position of authority with access to resources, or the bully who is far more successful in controlling the behavior of others than reality warrants. Each scenario depicts leadership, if only by its absence or in a negative form. The outcome is largely dependent on the choices of the followers. And then there are the leaders who motivate you to walk that extra painful mile, who wear their power comfortably but purposefully and convince you that there is an end beyond the means. The attributes of successful leaders have been well documented. As a class they are natural role models who convey the expectation that subordinates will emulate their values. Those values include a large dose of humanism and respect for people. People skills are their forte. They are very much part of the team, yet possess vision that sets them apart. That vision is shared openly and honestly, but in a restrained fashion so as not to overwhelm those that follow. The net result is security among followers based on the fact that someone is out front leading the way through uncharted territory. To accomplish the goals they share with their followers, these leaders surround themselves with the best and the brightest people for the challenge at hand and allow them to proceed, resisting any temptation to micromanage. They comfortably straddle the line between internal and external environments, acting, looking and speaking the part of leader, eclectically educated and polished. A sometimes inordinate faith is placed in the support of one's followers, and consequently they are comfortable taking risks. In fact, anything that does not entail risk in the acquisition is probably not worth having as far as they are concerned. Such are the characteristics of effective leaders, which may come to them naturally or through the cultivation of followers. With a leadership vacuum, there is little vision, even less risk-taking, and a parochialism that reduces work to drudgery. Communication becomes incomplete and guarded. Deception and insecurity begin to dominate and paralyze. Followers are restrained in their commitment, feeling an absence of direction. There is an uneasy sense among followers that they are being held to a higher standard than their supposed leaders. Today's challenge is to achieve practical application of these observations about leading and following and their relationship to power. Honesty also moves us to question whether a leadership vacuum is any more costly than a deficit of followers. Each role requires talent and strength. One is neither more nor less than the other, but simply aligned with different talents, personalities, and lifestyles. While the prescription for leadership seems clear, the qualities of an effective follower are less well defined. Are we comfortable with open and complete communication? Are we ready to buy into a vision when some pieces are imperfectly defined? Are we willing to assume ownership of our ideas, and to tear down the fences that are conveniently erected to maintain the distance between our professional and private lives? How much personal sacrifice will we endure and how much support and protection will we assure leaders when the going gets tough for them on our behalf? Those are neither leaders nor followers who find themselves marking time in place and going nowhere. Those who show the qualities of leadership should be empowered, and it is by this deliberate and conscious action that a cohort of followers is created.",

      "abstract": "Humility is a psychological characteristic marked by a balanced, accurate \nself-concept and pronounced focus on other people rather than oneself \n(Tangney, 2000). We propose that humility is characterized by five hallmarks, \nor observable markers: (a) a secure and accepting self-identity; (b) freedom \nfrom distortion about one’s strengths and weaknesses; (c) openness to new \ninformation about oneself and the world; (d) high focus on others relative to \nthe self; and (e) a belief that other people are equally worthy (Chancellor & \nLyubomirsky, 2013). Each hallmark must be present, but none is individually sufficient for a person to be humble. These hallmarks thus both define \nhumility and differentiate it from what it is not. In particular, the opposite of \nhumility is high self-focus, including an excessively positive (e.g., narcissism \nor arrogance) or negative (e.g., depression or low self-esteem) self-view. Further, under this hallmarks-based definition, humility can be distinguished from \nmodesty. Although humble people are frequently modest, they may sometimes \nbehave immodestly when speaking frankly about their genuine strengths and \naccomplishments. Additionally, narcissistic individuals may behave outwardly \nmodestly for self-presentational purposes while maintaining an inwardly inflated \nself-worth. As such, humility is neither merely the absence of arrogance nor the \npresence of modesty.",

      "abstract": "We live in an age of outspokenness, when disclosure of once-unmentionable attitudes, proclivities and private practices is commonplace and even encouraged. Yet one intimate personal habit remains widely concealed, a subject of embarrassment and ridicule, although it is probably universal, extremely useful, an intrinsic part of a full and productive life, and completely harmless to anyone else. I am referring to the unspeakable and largely untalked-of practice of talking to oneself. Psychologists have shown a remarkable neglect of the conversations that individuals have with themselves, except for Ruth Weir's (1962) classic account of infant-eavesdropping in Language in the Crib , and a controversy between Piaget and Vygotsky. Piaget (1959) referred to talking to oneself as part of an outward progression from egocentric thought to socialized speech. From an opposing perspective, Vygotsky (1962) regarded as a transition from external control of an infant's behavior by the language of others to personal and internal speech which is eventually silenced to become thought. Both seemed to regard talking to oneself as an essentially childish episode. Yet I doubt if many adults live in a silent world inside their heads, whether or not they make much noise outside. Many of us sing to ourselves, with or without an inner instrumental accompaniment. We whistle, hum and produce other sound effects. And especially, we talk to ourselves. I have been casually interested in talking to oneself for several years. The question which I first asked myself concerned what fluency in writing and fluency in speaking might have in common. Many people speak articulately but find writing difficult. Others write fluently but are reticent in speech. Some, of course, do both, and a few have difficulty in doing either. My question was whether there might be an underlying language fluency which in some people is expressed orally,",

For in old days men were placed in asylums, and then and there confined in a restraint-chair or strait-waistcoat, by leg-locks and hand-cuffs, and fed, washed, and dressed; and this together with some purging and blistering, constituted the treatment. By the latter, I mean that personal contact and influence of man over man, which the sane can exercise over the insane, and which we see so largely and beneficially exercised by those having the gift, whether superintendents, matrons, or attendants. There can be no proper treatment of an insane person without it, and, beyond all question, the recovery of many has been delayed or prevented by its absence. There are patients, however, who are not within its reach. A man or woman in a state of acute delirious mania is beyond moral treatment, and needs only that which is physical or medicinal. That is why it is of little importance whether we treat such in or out of an asylum, provided we can place them in a suitable apartment.",

The writer claims to know the subject but modes of asserting this may vary: education, intellect, access to written sources, may count or, in the case of hagiography, may be discounted in favour of a different familiarity. The claim may of course be tacit, as when a writer continues someone else's work and inherits his authority by default. In a well-functioning work, the self-identifying trope is tacitly or overtly matched to need, and this remains largely true of those sophisticated eleventh-century and twelfth-century histories where the historian freely writes himself or herself into events. The difference is that options have increased; the self-identifying can take as many forms as phases of the narrative require and any of these may function in more ways than one. Of course, some functions may be extra-textual: they may be personally or politically driven, as when Michael Attaleiates lauds Botaneiates, or Michael Psellos idealizes Michael Doukas and his son, or when Anna Komnene shakes her fist at Alexios's successors. In this chapter, I shall leave those to one side and consider modes of self-identification in these Middle Byzantine authors, which work towards a larger textual purpose.",

It is one of the worst consequences of this very spirit of controversy that it has led men to regard things too much in a single and exaggerated point of view. Truth is not one thing, but has many aspects and many shades of difference; it is neither all black nor all white; sees something wrong on its own side, something right in others; makes concessions to an adversary, allowances for human frailty, and is nearer akin to charity than the dealers in controversy or the declaimers against it are apt to imagine. The bigot and partisan (influenced by the very spirit he finds fault with) sees nothing in the endless disputes which have tormented and occupied men’s thoughts but an abuse of learning and a waste of time: the philosopher may still find an excuse for so bad or idle a practice.",

      "abstract": "Unlike materially grounded and strictly determined primitive equality, the realization of universally shared substantive equality is feasible only at a highly developed level of social/economic advancement that must be combined with the consciously pursued non-hierarchical (and thereby non-antagonistic) regulation of a historically sustainable social reproductive metabolism. That would be a radically different social metabolism, in contrast to all phases of historical development hitherto—including of course the spontaneous primitive equality of the distant past rooted in the grave material constraints of directly imposed natural necessity and struggle for survival.… \"Materiality\" of that kind, despite its unquestionable substantiveness, as linked to the corresponding hemmed-in \"spontaneity,\" is obviously not enough in order to achieve historical sustainability.… The requirement of materiality, in the case of the human being whose fundamental existential substratum is objectively determined nature, is essential. The seminal condition of materiality with regard to equality can be swept aside or wished out of existence—as a rule in a revealingly discriminatory and class-bound self-serving way—only by some idealist philosophical conception; one that predicates the commendability of some kind of equality (e.g., \"in the eyes of God\" or \"before the Law\") and at the same time denies the realizability of materially embodied substantive equality, in its defense of a most iniquitous social order.Click here to purchase a PDF version of this article at the Monthly Review website.",

Second, God’s will must be a sufficiently good proximate standard for action, better than acting on our own discretion or on some other proximate standard.

      "abstract": "A debt of good will (utang na loob in Filipino) is incurred when a person becomes the beneficiary of significant assistance or favor given by another. Usually, the beneficiary is in acute need of the assistance given or favor granted. This provides an opportunity for the giving of help to serve as a vehicle for the expression of sympathy or concern. The debt could then be appreciated as one of good will because, by catering to another person's pressing need, the benefactor is able to express positive dispositions towards the beneficiary. It is not merely the receipt of the assistance or favor that puts the recipient in a position of indebtedness. The indebtedness is created by the benefactor's kagandahang loob (good will). An act can be considered to convey kagandahang loob only if it is done out of kusang loob (roughly, free will); and can only be considered to have been done out of kusang loob if the agent (1) is not acting under external compulsion, (2) is motivated by positive feelings (e.g. charity, love or sympathy) towards the beneficiary, and (3) is not motivated by the anticipation of reward. These conditions entail debt-of-goodwill relationships where the benefactor has no right to demand reciprocity but the beneficiary has a \"self-imposed\" obligation to repay kagandahang loob with kagandahang loob. Debts of good will are about some forms of justice. But we should not reduce all talk about debts of good will to talk about justice.",

      "title": "Resources for Buddhist Environmental Ethics",
      "abstract": "In recent decades Buddhists have been turning their attention to problems. This nascent Green has found expression in activism and several edited volumes and monographs. (1) To date, however, no has formulated a systematic Buddhist ethic, and critics have highlighted a number of weak points in Buddhist arguments about issues. (2) Some of the arguments have faltered in interpreting pratitya-samutpada as a doctrine of interdependence that implies that all things support and nurture us, that we each need to take responsibility for everything that happens in the world, or that we are equally responsible for whatever happens; in claiming that identifying with or becoming one with something leads necessarily and immediately to valuing it and caring for it; in arguing for the intrinsic value and rights of things without clarifying a legitimate Buddhist basis for doing so; in viewing things as equal and thereby undermining the ability to determine the relative value and exact moral standing of things; in asserting that is sacred without articulating what, exactly, sacredness might mean in a Buddhist world view; and in failing to take into account historical Buddhist terms for and views of nature (3) and thereby overlooking how the Buddhist tradition historically has not embraced a particularly ecological view of the natural world. (4) Despite these and other weak points that writers have pointed out, Buddhism (5) does provide resources for constructing an ethic. This essay will take stock of what appear to be the most significant of those resources. For the sake of this essay, we can conceive of ethics in a broad sense that includes both the formal intellectual practice that takes place in the field of Environmental Ethics and this or that environmental in the sense of a set of beliefs, values, and guidelines that informs a person's attempt to live in an ecological manner. More often than not, a systematic ethic offers views of or makes claims about a number of topics: * the of human beings (an anthropology); * the of reality overall (a metaphysics); * how we should view reality (an epistemology); * non-human parts of reality (other animals, plants, inanimate objects, larger wholes like species or ecosystems); * the respective value (and types of value) of humans and the non-human parts of reality; * the respective value of individuals and wholes (and reflections on possible tensions between valuing individuals and valuing wholes); * principles and guidelines (values, maxims, modes of moral analysis, etc.) for making decisions and engaging in actions (or activism); * possible virtues humans should embody (that are ecologically positive); * an ecologically optimal state of affairs (a telos, whether in a local community, ecosystem, bioregion, country, or broader area); * the way to attain that goal or at least get things moving in that direction. Environmental ethics in the less formal sense--sets of beliefs, values, and guidelines that get put into practice in attempts to live in an ecological manner--also brings into the discussion such topics as the contours of an ecological way of living and the respects in which that way of living may be more fulfilling that other ways of living, whether individually or in a community. One of the most significant contributions that Buddhism can make to ethics is the view of humans--the anthropology--that it articulates in its core teachings. Writers conversant with Buddhism have highlighted problems with the dominant modern conception of the human person. William Ophuls writes, The modern worldview says that man is fundamentally a selfish hedonist. Concerned only with the satisfaction of his own desires, he rationally pursues fame, profit, and position--which inevitably puts him in conflict with others. …",

It may be an individual or a group, an obvious misfit or a concealed one, a temporary phenomenon or a permanent lifestyle (adopted willingly or unwillingly). The scapegoat makes it possible for man to live at peace with God, himself or his society by acting as symbolic recipient of qualities which man is unwilling to recognise in himself. The scapegoater by his treatment tries to reduce the scapegoat into something not human; for this reason a scapegoat which shows only small divergences from the norm evokes particular hostility. The individual scapegoat in a small group may accept his role fairly happily, but group scapegoats find few compensations. A variety of defence mechanisms will be adopted in these circumstances, but generally mature adjustment is impossible. The scientific and artistic achievements of scapegoats in the past have helped to liberalise society and extend the range of our compassion. So perhaps a society without scapegoats would lose its capacity for moral growth.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Xenophobia is a concept that has not received a great deal of attention in the psychological literature. According to the Oxford English Dictionary , the word consists of two parts: xeno (referring to “guest, stranger, person that looks different, foreigner”) and phobia (“fear, horror or aversion”). Although there has been little research or writing focusing directly on xenophobia, as a concept it raises three important issues that are relevant for research on prejudice and which have received a good deal of attention in the literature. First, prejudice does not necessarily involve negative attitudes towards others (e.g., they are dirty or untrustworthy). Simply perceiving a person as foreign, alien, or strange is sufficient to produce aversion or a preference for reduced contact. Second, xenophobia highlights the fact that prejudice against others involves both cognitive and emotional elements: It involves not only viewing other groups as different along some socially important dimension, but also having an aversive emotional reaction towards that difference. Third, prejudice is often studied within the context of intergroup relations or as attitudes held towards specific social groups; however, prejudice can also involve an aversion to difference per se . Xenophobia highlights the fact that sometimes people show dislike for others simply when they appear different to one's own “kind.” This form of prejudice is anchored in a love of or preference for people who are similar to one's self and an aversion to anyone who differs from one's self. In what follows I will review research and theory that elucidates each of these three central components of xenophobia, therefore providing some grounding for a term that has itself received little empirical investigation.",

      "title": "Presidential Address: The Place of Force in Human Society",
      "abstract": "H UMAN beings learn early that almost everything they want can be obtained only through each other's cooperation, whether their need or goal is a mother's breast or a love potion, a slave uprising or a new colony, a Nobel Prize or protection against a bullying policeman. Everyone learns, consciously or not, accurately or not, various ways of controlling others for one's own ends. Few people spend much time calculating how to control others, but everyone does so part of the time. Whatever people do, for whatever goals, will be evaluated by others, who will become thereby more or less willing to cooperate, more or less likely to resist, more or less likely to continue in the relationship. We all interact with others, engage in a flow of transactions with others; and whatever we do has some effect on others, to our advantage or not, in conformity with our wishes or not, and whether or not we will it so. Consequently, however else we might classify the wide range of human acts, we can also view them as samples of social control processes, i.e., the ways by which people shape the flow of each other's behavior. Almost all can be grouped into a small number of tvyes of social control forces. One of these is force and forcethreat, which I shall henceforth simply call force; when I mean only I shall so label it.' The use of force-and I repeat, I mean by this term both force-threat and overt force-is as ubiquitous as the preachments against it. Whatever else social systems are, they are also force systems. Force constitutes one of the major foundations of all social structures. The processes by which the command of force is expended, exchanged, accumulated, or lost, are universal in social interaction, because force is one of the fundamental resources people and groups need to elicit cooperation, help, and conformity from one another. Force constitutes one of the four great social control systems in all societies. For two millennia, social analysts have given much attention to three of these-which they have variously termed force, prestige, and wealth-because these underlie all stratification systems.2 The fourth, which",

      "abstract": "In the Ja‘farī school of law, jurisprudence is not conceived as a civil act, but is instead held to be a religious practice that orientates towards eschatology and theology. The scholarly focus has converged upon the proposition that human society would not reach the true path and salvation unless limitations on the actions and appetites of each individual were first put in place by Islamic ideology (that is explained by the Prophet and Imams). From the point of Ja‘farī scholars, God has sought to impose boundaries upon human activity by putting in place five categories which encompass positive law in its entirety: absolutely forbidden actions (ḥarām), indispensable or expressly commanded actions (wājib or farḍ), admissible or permitted actions (mubāḥ), recommended or desired actions (mustaḥabb or mandūb) and reprehensible or offensive actions (makrūh). In the absence of solutions or rulings that can be achieved through the application of legal texts and methods, the principle of custom (‘urf) emerges as a valid source in response to the impossibility of restricting social issues that pertain to the jurisprudence. At this point, the resort to ‘urf which is applied as a legal principle in urgent circumstances may become an indispensable part of Islamic law that helps to validate the given solution or to categorise the permissible acts within the Ja‘farī school of law. The application of ‘urf might be considered as an affirmation of the position which holds that primary issues of faith (i‘tikād) should be determined with reference to the original Islamic sources including the Qur’an, the Sunna, icmā’ (consensus), ‘aql (reason) according to Ja‘farī school of law. However, here, it should be remembered that the scholars frequently advocate flexible and pragmatic approaches in the sphere of social relations (mu‘āmalāt). The implementation process of rules for cases pertaining to social relations can be said to have given credence to ‘urf being applied directly as a legal principle or as a subsidiary factor that relates to the interpretation of various legal principles. It is quite conceivable that the application of ‘urf will result in changes to legal methodologies and temporary legal rulings that had previously given by the early scholars of Ja‘farī school of law. The flexible nature of Islamic law in the scope of mu‘āmalāt authorises the scholars to interpret the legal sources (in harmony with the necessities of time and place) by using various legal methodologies. It is in fact the case that scholars are required to acknowledge the changing needs and habits of contemporary time during the jurisdiction process by preserving the formal framework of religious sanctity. The scholars have sought to set out the principles in more detail along with the conditions of their implementation. These principles relate to cases in which the true ordinance of God is not clear or deduced from the main sources of Islamic law. At the initial and foundational periods of the school, the classical Ja‘farī scholars openly referred to ‘urf as an independent source of ruling. However, the scholars of later and contemporary period have avoided to address ‘urf directly but prepared a substructure with ‘urf in order to use it during the interpretation of procedural and secondary sources. Among these sources, especially the principle of sīra ‘uqalā’iyya has gained a prestigious position and expanded the range of its validity in legal area according to explanations of recent Ja‘farī scholars. The principle of sīra ‘uqalā’iyya in operating as a legal constraint, prioritises the local conditions of the region and simultaneously operates at the level of theory and practice. The analogical and etymological comparison between the principles of ‘urf and sīra ‘uqalā’iyya clarifies that ‘urf (which finds its origin in the daily practices of people) is considered more vulnerable than and sīra ‘uqalā’iyya (which finds its roots in the rational practices of people).",

      "title": "Moral Implication of Acquisitive Instinct Under the Separation of Ownership and Control",
      "abstract": "The argument to be developed in this paper begins with the idea that a natural means-ends relationship comes into existence when ownership and control are combined. Property owned and con? trolled by the same person is natural in the sense that it is in accord with the original human nature. This natural relationship is based on love that intermediates the use of means and the intended ends of the owner for which means are adapted. When an owner directly manages his own business (means), whether successful or unsuccess? ful, we are assured that the owner-manager never knowingly turns against the goals or ends of his business and that the diversion in the use of means away from the intended ends cannot occur. The ugly outbreak of embezzlement, of padded expense accounts, of kick-backs, and of bribes, cannot infiltrate this natural relationship. Obviously, the owner cannot steal from his own pocket. Neither can he squander the company's money without depleting his own treasury. A bribe cannot corrupt him because the favor sought from him is worth more to him than the bribe. The owner can neither mistake nor be?",

      "abstract": "In recent time, some Igbo people do not bring in kola nut to any\r\nceremony of theirs and even when they do, they do not handle it the way it should be handled. To such people, it is associated with idol 207 208 worship and as such, it should be done away with. .In order to disabuse the minds of such people about all these important kola nut rites , this paper tried to explain that kola nut , even though is small, it is mighty; though it is a classless nut when distantly observed but classy when\r\nsubjected to the crucible of reason for what it represents. In the words of Shakespeare, “Things are not what they seem”. It went further to explain that in its smallness, kola represents so many variables. Most importantly, it stands for hospitality, peace, unity, conviviality, joviality, et cetera. On the other hand, its absence or mishandling in Igbo gatherings – social or otherwise, invariably can generate confusion in such a way that nothing can move till it is brought in. The paper also made attempts to explain some kola rites: presentation of kola, blessing, and breaking, sharing and chewing of kola. Here, apart from chewing which anyone can do, not everyone has right to present, break, share or bless kola nut among the Igbo. It went on to explain the messages of oji when broken especially with regard to the number of cotyledons it has. Kola itself has laws. These were explained. This paper came to conclusion by saying that God created kola and handed it down to ancestors as a symbol of communication between himself, the ancestors and God. This to the Igbo signifies that wherever kola comes\r\nin, God, ancestors and man are in communion with one another.",

No notice, however, is taken of the existence of supererogatory acts, which just express a person's attitude without achieving a direct effect. In phenomenological respect this category should not be overlooked so as to do justice to the conduct of someone like Janus Korczak, who, of his own accord and as a sign of his deep solidarity, accompanied orphans entrusted to his care to a concentration camp and to their death. In situations in which a person is deprived of the possibility of achieving a certain purpose he can, all the same, demonstrate his own moral attitude without being obliged to do so according to usual moral standards. Through such conduct he can, in a way transcending his duty, symbolize, on the one hand, his altruistic attitude, on the other hand, his personal ideals.",

      "abstract": "Within the wider context of contemporary spiritual practice or esotericism, individuals can be observed (not only in Germany but also elsewhere), who combine different kinds of alternative healing practices in order to gain or maintain physical and mental health, well-being, success and autonomy. These practices were said to take place only within the very private sphere, partly because those beliefs do not change the everyday lifestyles of individ­uals significantly, at least in comparison with the much more formative traditional religions. These practices are often connected to discernibly spiritual or religious, often inconsistent combinations of beliefs that contain a ‘multiple­ salvation logic’ which is used by the actors themselves to explain why they act in certain ways. At the same time, key features of ‘secular rationality’ are a central aspect as well; for example, the level of semantics, which here is ‘the secular’, is a category actively and deliberately, though implicitly applied, positively defined (for example, as scientific) and constantly placed in relation to the categories of ‘spiritual’ and ‘religious’. These also are transformed, but always remain structurally recognisable within the differently reported world-views, especially if one considers instrumental rationality as something widely associated with the ‘secular’ in contrast with the ‘religious’ or ‘spiritual’. This paper shows, firstly, the different versions of salvation logic and reasoning of action within individual world-views, and secondly it focuses on examples of the semantics used in reports of individ­uals’ own world-views. Thirdly, against this backdrop, the term ‘post-secular’, understood in this way, as opposed to its original meaning, is discussed in order to point out former limits and some new possibilities when this term is used as a description of current forms of religion.",

There are common human aims which arise from biological needs, but this level of need is so general that it spells out no particular solution. Given motive and the capacity to learn, solutions which seem better than previous ones may be devised; or borrowed. They can be borrowed or tried out because the body does not have to change to adopt them, or to pass them on to the next generation. Social transmission is vital for preserving skills and knowledge and for changing them: but it is fatal to any rigid scheme of successive stages in social evolution. The contact of cultures, diffusions of ideas and techniques enable people to jump over intervening stages that others may have had to pass through to reach a skill or state they now hold. Think of reading and writing, or transport by air. It has been suggested that we ought no longer speak of Western medicine but call it cosmopolitan; that too indicates the point that progress through a regular sequence of steps is not necessary to introduce a change. And there are options to reject social introductions which do not exist for measles or the pox—they also spread by contacts between people of different cultures.",

(Other terms are encountered for the same concepts.) The distinction hinges on whether the action or event is conceived of as requiring an elapse of time; the membership of a verb in one category or the other is therefore a matter of the meaning of the verb itself: ‘look for’ or ‘travel’ or ‘carve’ are inherently durative; ‘find’ or ‘arrive’ or ‘stab’ are inherently punctual. However, durative events can be conceived of as POINTS in future or past time (Alice traveled in Europe last year, punctual in contradistinction to the durative Alice was traveling in Europe when she met her husband), and punctual notions readily can be used in transferred (figurative) senses which are durative: I’m finding that Howard is possessive is an ordinary kind of sentence, whereas I’m finding a cat under the bed is so odd as to be unprocessable.1",

We talk of social life, where one seeks enjoyment, sociable life or gregarious life, relating to, connected with, or suited to public or fashionable society, a social event, living or disposed to live in companionship with others, or in community, rather than in isolation and unfriendliness. Social problems are general factors that affect and damage society. A social problem is normally a term used to describe problems within a particular area or a group of people in the world. Social problem often involve problems that affect real life. It also affects how people react to certain situations [1] . Terrorism is psychological strategy of war for gaining political or religious ends by deliberately creating a climate of fear among the population of a State. Terrorism is also defined as the systematic use of terror and terror itself is defined as an alarm, dread, panic, fearfulness [2] . The benefits resulting from combing two or more different groups, people, objects or process or behavior of a system that cannot be predicted by behavior of its parts is called synergy. This work shall seek ways and manner, wherein Law and Social Security shall boost the enhancement of the National Development to the advantage of the citizens. That is where the Law enforcement Agency, through lawful means stop kidnappings and Terrorism. The Nation will be impacted negatively and National development will suffer a decline as nobody would want to remain in a country where life and/or social life, properties will not be secure.

It is a by-product of the deference and responsiveness that are essential to our engagement with the world. We cannot form and sustain valuable personal relationships without seeing ourselves as answerable to the other participants in those relationships. And we cannot develop and sustain valuable projects without responding to the constraints imposed on our activities by the nature and requirements of those projects themselves. More generally, we cannot engage with the world without responding differentially—or displaying partiality—with respect to the objects of our engagement. Partiality is thus a by-product of engagement. We cannot engage with the world at all without exhibiting forms of partiality.",

It is perhaps troubling specifically to those who think with his philosophy, a philosophy as much of as for life. trouble arises immediately from the difficulty in readily assimilating appears to be an obvious paradox in general--a and a philosophy of life. Nor is one immediately able to resist seem to be natural impulses of synthesis and identification (not to go as far as interpretation): Deleuze the man and Deleuze the philosopher, Deleuze as an act of and Deleuze as thought of life. And yet, these are unsynthesizable poles particularly because of the ways in which Deleuze conceptualizes suicide, because of the function or the figure of in his philosophical movements. Unlike Michel whose words have been, in one way or another, used to explain acts in which he allegedly engaged and have been made to equal a death drive, (1) Deleuze appears to treat unambiguously and consistently as a failed line of flight, as a botched experiment. Nevertheless, when he invokes Foucault's thought in A Portrait of Foucault, (2) Deleuze conceptualizes the figure with intensity closely akin to an embrace, though cautious and resistant to its draw. His thinking through the line Outside, through drawing the line, is particularly compelling and illuminating to an inquiry into one of the significant theoretical divergences between the two thinkers, namely their conceptions of desire and pleasure. My essay extends this inquiry not in order to settle but rather to mobilize the figure of as a line of flight, souci de soi, in terms of desire and pleasure. (3) It is rather a movement towards engaging Foucault's and Deleuze's conceptions of through the significance of the notion to their philosophies of living. While it is the drawing of an interlocution, it is also an effort to desubjectify and speak of it, in a way, between Deleuze and as a movement, an acceleration, and a techne. To ask what is presents an ontological query that perhaps is not the appropriate approach to the question vis-a-vis Foucault's program. But, literally and conventionally, in terms of common sense, how does one think the concept suicide? More often than not, it finds itself integrated in the medical discourse (though its itinerary meanders through religious and legal discourses), linked with morbidity, clinical depression, despair, renunciation, an obsession or fascination with or a death-drive, a loss of interest in or value of life, even with a lack of morality. (4) In a variety of ways, James Miller's Passion of Michel considered to be one of the four major biographies of the thinker, (5) seems to both draw and build on these connections, interpreting and deducing the subject of his portrait, from shards of thought and fragmented utterances. This approach reinforces the commonplace opposition of to life, a dichotomy that Foucault collapses. Deleuze approaches the portrait of Foucault through affects and percepts, experimenting and thinking with, which allows for an opening and a drawing of new plateaus. In the same sense, I seek to let Foucault break suicide open, especially by considering his question How had the subject been compelled to decipher himself in regard to was forbidden? (6) It is a question that permits an unfolding of the way in which the line of flight is implicated in suicide, in the art of life and both in politics. In a curious text titled The Simplest of Pleasures, Foucault envisions a gun store clerk who helps a person select the most apposite style of for them. He commences the text by denying that he would be yet another to debate the making of either legal or moral, but the text seems to both subvert and perhaps on a certain level do just that. …",

There are two fundamental approaches to the problem of human beings and environment: the first asks what the human being does to his environment, seeking to learn how the person projects himself on the external world; the second asks what the environment does to the human being, seeking to know how the environment modifies the person. In thinking about environments for older people, attention is too often given the physical aspects, to the exclusion of the psychological aspects. Objects and people may be in the physical environment of a person of any age without affecting him. Constraints are the limitations which surround a person and prevent him from realizing his potentialities. They include not only prohibitions that are explicitly verbalized, but also all interferences, deficiencies, and inadequacies that prevent the use of personal, material, and group resources.",

Although, at a first glance, focusing on leveling and affirmation of individualism may appear contradictory concepts, power of first one and utopia of second one get on together fairly well and for a long time. The condition of history may seem a serious matter only for one who pays too much attention human values, spirituality by which, as it is said, a person goes beyond any other form of life. Such a man is confused and disappointed in finding out how one who should like him becomes more and more opposite a subject, a weak self and unaware of real conditions of his existence, who wanders about without stability, without an aim, without specific features.1Quite often, a man has come identify himself with an image. He forgets that life means also privacy, that real way of living implies privacy. He has transformed himself into somebody placed under curious eye of public, used being somebody only in service of this public. Thus, his desire remain alone with himself diminishes and profound beliefs of existence do not tell him too much. The real individual neglects fact that, finally, each person has accept himself, with beauties he nourishes and with his personal frustrations, make peace with himself after having made his own choices, with meanness and goodness he transmits. Nobody can escape from himself, no matter how unconsciously and deeply absorbed he may by his image, by his celebrity. There will come, without doubt, some sporadic moments become conscious, draw balance sheet of regrets, remorse, joys, fulfillment etc.I come back say that everything that is most precious in a man's life are singular beliefs, values nourished and private experiences. To be and to have. To be is linked privacy and quality, to refers public space and quantity. Celebrity could understood as a to which replaces to be. Quite often, a person does not know any more that he has become an image, that he fails live in favour of mimicking living. Existence should placed under a question mark when the outside has tendency replace inside, when privacy of spirit with itself is no longer a need or has changed into something unknown, when, from point of view of value, there is no distinction between quality and quantity, when hollow individual is cultivated and not person, a substantial existence which takes care of spirit.Celebrity is looked for, is desired, envied by others, it is a fashion of present time, although its greatest risk is miss really important things. Being concerned polish your own image, you forget that you take care of an image and that any image is a limitation spiritual power. The few ones who value profound ego of privacy, with its crucial, extreme experiences, for whom there is no distance between theory and practice, who make an effort live in agreement with what they are thinking, being perfectly aware that only in this way they are honest themselves and life given them, on other hand, they dedicate themselves a troublesome and continuous struggle.It is much harder your own person or dominated by understanding and mentality of masses than yourself, evaluate yourself consciously, endeavor with honesty improve your ego, simply follow your destiny according your own singular beliefs. Neither intelligence nor culture can relevantly serve you if you have not previously assumed freedom and courage yourself in spite of anything else.Nevertheless, tendency existing in society leveling people's tastes, sticking a certain fashion are in a close interdependence with creation of illusion of individual freedom2. …",

      "abstract": "Abstract The world is full of suffering. God is either helpless to prevent it, in which case He is not all-powerful, or does not choose to prevent it, in which case He is not all-good. For generations this has been regarded as the most effective argument against the belief that an omnipotent and omnibenevolent being exists. Naturally, theists have tried their hardest to come up with an adequate reply. Among the numerous suggestions as to how to meet the atheistic challenge we find some that contain important religious ideas yet, unfortunately, do not mitigate the problem. Many of us have heard it said that (1) we must not take for granted all the joy and moral beauty in the world, which by far outstrips the amount of existing pain and moral ugliness; or that (2) all suffering ultimately brings about a greater good and hence is not to be regarded as evil. There is wisdom in these sayings, but they are irrelevant to the problem of evil. Multiply or divide the amount of pain in the world by a billion, and its incompatibility with divine goodness and omnipotence is not affected.",

Many of these will be expressions of personality of which the individual may be unaware or even cherish and which evoke a favorable or neutral response from others. Conversely, displays such as gross involuntary tics or compul sive rituals are a burden to the sufferer and are socially embarrassing or obnoxious. These may be manifestations of a more fundamental neurotic disorder or the product of deep-seated maladaptive learning. Nail-biting occupies a central position along such a spectrum. Al though it may serve as a tension-reducing or other functional device, few nail-biters would not wish to be rid of the habit but find it as difficult to eliminate as, say, an addiction to smoking. Even so, it cannot be considered abnormal in a psychiatric sense in that many nail-biters exhibit none of the traits and symptoms characteristic of mental disorder.",

But there is also an objective perfection, a life which, by its obligations and the activities it entails, of its nature requires a high degree of perfection; and where such a life is embraced by a solemn and perpetual obligation, it places a person in a state of perfection. While the Spirit breathes where it wills, and the subjective degree of love of God depends chiefly on individual grace, the objective means of perfection (namely, good works which, so to say, compel the exercise of a high degree of love of God and other virtues which accompany it) can be studied as a pattern of perfection, and organised as a means of perfection.",

Two primary forms of activity, maintaining order and putting in order, are analysed. The first is making thin people into order and overweight people into disorder, and thus maintains order in the weight order. The other, putting in order, covers different activities supposed to make sure that people keep their bodies thin or try to become thin. These ordering activities meet resistance when overweight people stop dieting and/or define overweight as a personal choice and themselves as good enough, or even healthy and beautiful.

      "title": "Analysis of the Different Types of Altruistic Behavior and Its Reason",
      "abstract": "There are some dimensionalities of altruistic behavior: Purity, whether the motivation is pure altruism or self-regard; Degree, whether the help is of his all or not; Extent, whether he supplies help for all men or not; Frequency, whether he does often or not. From the point of purity, there are two types of altruistic behavior, one is soft altruism, whose genuine motivation is wishing to get the benefaction for the future from the one who had received help from himself ago, and it results in building a mutual-benefit system of cognation or non-cognation between men. The other is hard altruism, that’s to say, people gain satisfaction not from the someone’s benefaction who was once received help from himself but from the altruistic behavior itself. From the point of degree, hard altruistic behavior can also be separated into two types: limited (moderate) hard altruistic behavior and infinite (thorough) hard altruistic behavior. The former obey the rule of descending marginal utility, therefore, from the point of evolvement, it can’t decrease does’ existent adaptability. The latter does not obey the rule of descending marginal utility but increasing one, then the condition of maximum utility lies on putting all his scarce resource to altruistic behavior. So it will descend individual adaptability, even victimize individual survival, and it results the Darwin-Jam. How can it come into being, come through and evolve by the process of natural selection? Altruistic behavior is often considered to have relationship with sympathy and moral culture. Father, someone’s sympathy and moral culture often point to special kind of human not to all. So from the broad sense sympathy and moral action have relation with self-identity. From the point of extent, the man who gives the benefaction generally thinks that the man who receives his benefaction is of the same category. Why do men have the self-identity based on the sympathy and moral culture? From the point of individual, may be it has relation with gene. As infest animal, if he doesn`t have any self-identity and will not do any victimization for anyone, it has much difficulty to inherit his gene probably in the process of evolvement, because no one will become his consort. In the other extreme, if he has self-identity too extensive and too strong and helps everyone of his all, the rate of survival must be very low and it also has difficulty to inherit his gene probably. Most of the people have certain scope of self-identity, and the extent of altruistic behavior depends on the scope and object of self-identity, which often has the most strong core and then descends as scope broadening step by step. The degree of altruistic behavior lies on the degree that the one received benefaction is identified by the one gives the benefaction, and they have positive relation. The descending sequence of different people’s self-identity from strong to weak is often different, many people put relative and friends in a more important position, then neighbor, estate, class, nation, country, race and so on.Considered from the point of extent, the most frequently altruistic behavior is to relative first, then to special beneficial non-relative, and last to universal men.Considered from the point of degree, the most frequent relative altruistic behavior is infinite hard altruistic behavior, then to special beneficially non-relative, and last to universal men. The scope and object of self-identity, the descending sequence of self-identity and the degree that he will do for the object he approbated have relation with the culture and tradition of his living environment, that`s to say, it has relation with family education that he received from childhood, school education, social living record of himself. From the point of society, what needs answer is why it can form such culture and tradition, family education and school education, which enable some one to come into being self-identity, sympathy and moral culture. And in the living culture of every nation, there is praise for non-relative altruistic behavior, which will cause the altruistic behavior of someone with self-identity, and the different scope and degree has relation with his different living record. The culture and tradition of such praise for non-relative altruistic behavior can explain individual hard altruistic behavior, especially infinite hard altruistic behavior; while competition and conflict between different nations can explain the form of such culture and tradition. So we need explain one’s non-relative hard altruistic behavior, especially infinite hard altruistic behavior from two lays: gene and culture. Gene lay determines that most of the people have certain self-identity and form the physiological basis of altruistic behavior, while the scope and object, descending sequence of self-identity and the degree of willing victimize for the people of the same category is determined by culture and tradition. The competition between individual and colony makes someone who mixes self-regard and altruism pro rate and his colony have more adaptability in multiple competition.",

      "title": "What cannot be said?",
      "abstract": "What cannot be said? The question presses, as there are no words, or no fitting words, or no words that make sense let alone do justice, all perhaps in the face of demands (not) to speak. And, as voice collapses in the midst of the violence that confounds reference, degrades language, imposes silence, and enforces repression—what cannot be said may turn on privation, the grounds, incentives, and intentions of expression that are banished, disappeared, and colonized, often in the name of deterring and containing the \"dangerous\" word, the word assumed to be violent, perhaps intrinsically and perhaps as it's held to contravene the homologeō with so much \"barbarism.\" In this way, what cannot be said may also be a function of what's given or taken for granted, whether as capacity, presumption, affirmation, commonplace, law, or spirit, just as it may stem from surplus, the economies of nonstop expression that cannot bear quiet reflection on their own presumptions, not least the possibility that there is such a thing as too much all at once.What cannot be said? Speaking is fraught, in the midst of a breath-taking pandemic and the suffocating smoke—so much smoke—of the next war and an earth on fire. It is an altogether tense time, place, and manner to speak, at a moment when the idea, doctrine, and \"marketplace\" of \"free expression\" divides generations and fuels contemporary kulturkampf, a proto-stasis in which fewer and fewer want or care to hear from those who are not already in the \"proper\" (progressive, reactionary, tolerant, conservative, fundamentalist, etc., etc.) crowd, singing the proper tune in the right chords, the truths about all the big lies. The infinitely recallable words afloat in social media's gloomy cloud set the fear of being called out—ever later—into the calling to speak. The demand to burn books echoes from school board meeting to meeting, as trending tirades about the difference between cancelation and censorship flame, smolder, and flame back. More fire—throwing light on the fact that the problem at hand is a very old one. The hemlock has taken many forms, with varying levels of toxicity. The promise underwriting audi alteram partem has long provoked (better and worse) opposition and more than a few bans for violating standing \"terms of service.\"What cannot be said? It's fashionable to deem language incapable of revealing what \"matters\" and so best indicted as mere \"linguisticism.\" If the charge risks a certain hypocrisy, it is never self-evident what grounds good speech or embodies its power, whether to cross the line turned smudge between speaking and writing, and how best to conceive the work of interpretation, representation, and critique that continues to attend and confound expression. Though so many words yet strive to figure a rational-deliberative-public persona that may have long left the building, this aspiration with dwindling audience may be no less chilling than a fragmenting articulation of belief that demands recognition of an \"I\" that appears naïve to the speech-action on which its emergence hinges. One wonders then if much has changed, if we remain in a moment, as Foucault put it, that \"never attached much importance to the fact that, after all, speech exists\"—a denial that has well-served those who take the word as their own in the name of refusing any advice about the merits of learning more about how to talk about talk.What cannot be said? The question abides, multiplies, and compounds, not least within and between rhetoric and philosophy. What goes and what can perhaps only go without saying, for better and worse—that is, for the lifeworld? What is said in what's left unsaid, perhaps as the unsayable is the ground and demand to speak? What's not being said in the name of being and at the cost of becoming otherwise? What remains unsaid and unsayable, in silence and in the midst of the damage done, not least the damage done to language itself? What cannot be said in time and what saying has no place? What cannot be said for history? How does what cannot be said appear—as inability, choice, prohibition, transgression, virtue, imperative? What potential abides in the unsaid and unsayable, for truth, freedom, authority, judgment?What cannot be said? Quick and tidy replies will not do, except perhaps as evasion. This is partly to say that it is likely important not to introduce this special issue of Philosophy & Rhetoric, an extended and challenging consideration of the question—What cannot be said? It is not so much that the essays here speak for themselves, although in many ways they do, at the same time that they ask after and frequently trouble such certainty. It is not that they demand silence, even as they provoke quiet reflection. And it is not that they require an interpretive map, as they are best approached from multiple angles and taken up in various orders—the essays here sit in some tension, and also abide with and work for one another, in ways that invite discovery. Indeed, anything resembling a \"proper\" introduction may be less a distraction than evidence of a deep misunderstanding, a failure to grasp that the question of what cannot be said—as a question—may resist obligatory first words, the definitions, topoi, speech acts, and language games that are deemed prior and held so very tight, perhaps at the cost of language itself. The essays here, not least as they manifest the possibility that Adorno discerned in the essay's form, resist this conformity. In their own way, each \"says what is at issue and stops where it feels itself complete—not where nothing is left to say\" (1984, 152). Neither first nor last word, but a compound opening, an idea whose very form may amount to heresy.",

      "abstract": "When people suffer they always suffer as a whole human being. The emotional, cognitive and spiritual suffering of human beings cannot be completely separated from all other kinds of suffering, such as from harmful natural, ecological, political, economic and social conditions. In reality they interact with each other and influence each other. Human beings do not only suffer from somatic illnesses, physical pain, and the lack of decent opportunities to satisfy their basic vital, social and emotional needs. They also suffer when they are not able to experience and grasp any meaning of life even if such suffering is not quite as obvious as most forms of physical, social and emotional suffering. Suffering from the lack for the sense of the meaning of life is a special form of emotional, cognitive, and spiritual suffering. Although all human beings share the same basic human need for some meaning of life, the fulfilment of this need is highly individual and personal. Although all forms of human suffering can be a challenge to the meaning of life, the personal conditions of suffering usually are a stronger challenge for the meaning of life. Among the personal conditions of human suffering, the Grenzsituationen cannot be cancelled or raised at all, but only accepted and coped with as existential aspects of the conditio humana. According to Karl Jaspers these are: death, suffering, struggling, guilt, and failing. The challenge for human beings to cope with these Grenzsituationen is a way to move from the mere Being-there to true human Existence. 1",

These factors make humans indulge their lust rather than the way they are until their behavior is like an animal even more misguided. They do not establish good relations with Him, never and regret and repent of their sins and mistakes. They are servants of Satan (â€˜Abd al Shathan) Allah hates disobedience and perpetrators. Instead humans are loved because they have a good relationship with Him. Always obey and regret his mistakes and repent to Him. God loves all kinds of goodness and the culprit. They are servants of Allah (â€˜Abdullah). A servant of Allah who wants to reach the degree of being loved by Allah (al mahbub minallah) must go through the stages, including through the degree of mahabbah and loving Allah (al muhibb lillah) in the deeds of action in the perspective of the hadith. Acts or behaviors that make Allah's servants loved by Allah have already been established in the authentic al-Sunnah al shahihah of the Prophet Muhammad.

      "abstract": "Identity interweaves with the emotions of its bearer, either as an individual or a group member. Identity defines the emotional attitude towards other people (their ‘own’ or ‘alien’), towards the social and natural environment, towards the world as a whole. On the other hand, the emotional attitude determines the identity. This attitude could be spontaneously occurring, but very often it is culturally conditioned, and purposefully designed. Postulates of national identity can take the form of imperatives like „Love your motherland!” Very often they are formulated in another way that replaces the imperative with allegations expressed by claims in first person (single or plural) or in impersonal form. Such statements are similar and operate as spells. The ambivalent attitude to the ‘own’ contains some negative elements. Their designation may indicate a trauma, frustration caused by some kind of insufficiency (including a lack of heroic deeds), inferiority complex. Trauma and shame can be pushed to the unconscious, but can also be productive as a cohesive element and as search for compensatory actions or verbal structures.",

Roles are not always contracts, nor are they simply means of protecting others. Because of their complexity the moral weight of one role differs from that of another. For present purposes, a role is a nameable position within a social network; those who hold the position are expected to act, and perhaps feel, in certain ways. Deviations generate sur? prise, uneasiness, disappointment, or disap? proval. Not all roles are voluntarily assumed; physician is, but grandmother is not.

A musical instrument, a scientific artifact, a collection of sounds, an antique postcard: yes, all these objects are expressive and sometimes aesthetically pleasing, and in being so they can be understood to embody an epistemology, with theories and realms of knowledge written into their every contour. Or they can be understood as traces of global exchange and displacement. But what if the object is not very good, not loveable at all? Crumbling, toxic paper or banal images, with no exit from a strange historical or cultural space, perhaps an uncomfortable space to which you feel averse (or at least, feel you should disdain, as beneath contempt)? Or what if the object is misdirecting? What if it is ephemeral, like sound, something that cannot be held? These questions are woven in this essay into a reflection on the forms taken by certain loves for opera, a reflection centered on some nineteenth-century material objects that relate to act 4 of Giacomo Meyerbeer’s opera Les Huguenots (1836).",

In the part of the gods, the indians not just venerate his gods, also admit them as be coexistent and absorbed in his real life. The life daily can be divided in two aspects: the ethics and the reality. In the meaning of ethics, the elements more important by indians are the honor, the humility and the diligence. Although is important to keep his honor, the more important is not dishonor the ancestors. The humility is an virtue more demanded to high class society. So the arrogance is prohibited more specially to this class, and no have to pretend the arrogance. The diligence is necessary in the relations with others, in the service to gods and, naturally, in the work. In the reality Sahagun narrate the lifes hard, grave, rough and deceitful, but not totally negatives. He say this to not suffer too much when they meet with the vicissitude. Comparing the aztec world with the other nations of the 16th century, the different roles between mans and women are not too grave.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Physical and instinctive needs are natural and neutral, can not in itself be said that one's needs are higher than the other. It is precisely the way in which people manage and satisfy those needs that can be given a praiseworthy or despicable title. In the view of Islam, if these needs are met with the actions carried out according to Islamic guidance, then it will be a commendable act. Conversely, if these needs are met with acts that violate the guidance of Islam then he becomes a disgraceful act. Spiritual intelligence associated with the problem of meaning, value, spiritual intelligence is able to guide humans to find meaning and can also guide people in reaching his ideals. Spiritual intelligence goes beyond the ability to intelligently think, feel, act and behave in situational contexts or given frameworks. Spiritual intelligence enables humans to be wise in reflecting on the situation to find themselves more meaningful so as to be able to transform something more precious. With the formation of spirituality culture in the workplace, it is expected to form employees who are happy, know and able to meet the purpose of life. Such employees generally have a balanced life between work and person, between duty and service. In general, they also have higher performance. The results of a large consulting firm, the application of a spiritual work environment increase productivity and reduce turn over. Other studies show that employees of high spiritual intelligence and supported by a work environment that is also spiritual, positively become more creative, have high job satisfaction, are able to work well in teams, and have a high commitment to the organization.

      "title": "Trust as an Unquestioning Attitude",
      "abstract": "Abstract According to most accounts of trust, you can only trust other people (or groups of people). To trust is to think that another has goodwill, or something to that effect. I sketch a different form of trust: the unquestioning attitude. What it is to trust, in this sense, is to settle one’s mind about something, to stop questioning it. To trust is to rely on a resource while suspending deliberation over its reliability. Trust lowers the barrier of monitoring, challenging, checking, and questioning. Trust sets up open pipelines between yourself and parts of the external world. Trust permits external resources to have a similar relationship to one as one’s internal cognitive faculties. This creates efficiency, but at the price of exquisite vulnerability. We must trust in this way because we are cognitively limited beings in a cognitively overwhelming world. Crucially, we can hold the unquestioning attitude towards objects and technologies. When I trust my climbing rope, I stop worrying about its reliability. When I trust my online calendaring system, I simply go to the events indicated, without question. But, one might worry, how could one ever hold such a normatively loaded attitude as trust towards mere objects? How could it ever make sense to feel betrayed by an object? Trust is our engine for expanding and outsourcing our agency—for binding external processes into our practical selves. Thus, we can be betrayed by our smartphones in the same way that we can be betrayed by our memory. When we trust, we try to make something a part of our agency, and we are betrayed when our part lets us down. To unquestioningly trust something is to let it in—to attempt to bring it inside one’s practical functioning. This suggests a new form of gullibility: agential gullibility, which occurs when agents too hastily and carelessly integrate external resources into their own agency.",

      "abstract": "By contrast, the events in Paris confront us with evil of another sort.In ideologically-driven evil, the agent does not believe he is doing wrong.Rather, he believes his actions are justified by an objective good.Killing and maiming others is morally acceptable when viewed as promoting the goals and values of his family, his group, political party, country and/or religion.He is not burdened by guilt or regret because the victim is no longer viewed as human, as one of \"us,\" but rather as an anonymous other devoid of any humanity.It is important to differentiate these two forms of evil if we are to fashion more effective means of responding to the challenge of evil. 1 All too often, the public either demonizing those who commit such acts, interpreting them as motivated to perpetrate evil for its own sake rather than for reasons which are comprehensible however much we may rightly condemn them, or explains their acts by reference to a psychiatric disorder.Both of these perspectives fails to appreciate the complexity of the problem and obscures the combination of situational, historical, and motivational variable undergirding evil by blaming these actions on something other than the agent's choices.Without the freedom to choose otherwise, to refrain from such actions, we have no basis for attributing moral responsibility to perpetrators of terrorism, no way to distinguish evil from actions whose consequences are unfortunate, but inadvertent or unintended.Only when we understand the horrific actions of terrorists as serving perverse but thoroughly human ends can we begin to fashion strategies that are responsive to evil's ever-changing forms.",

In his pride and disobedience man is separated from God and can only return to him by following the path of virtue, by making reparation through humility and obedience. Christ who came to do the will of his Father is a model for our obedience. Religious obedience is but Christian obedience in the wake of Christ's own, carried to its conclusion by which we are made one with him. Satan was the first to begin to question the commands of obedience. ‘Why’, he said, ‘did God command you not to eat of the tree of good and evil ?’ (Gen. 3). Before this, man who was without guile obeyed without reserve, not so much because of the reasonableness of the command but because of the authority of the commander. For just as faith in what human reason has experienced is not meritorious, so obedience is separated from the virtue of humility when the reason for the command is in agreement with it. But you wish to hear why we should act or cease to act in accordance with another's will or command. The reason is because in this way especially we are imitators of Christ, as dearest sons; and we walk in the love with which we loved us. He was made obedient in all things for us, not only to assist us but also to be an example, so that as he behaved so may we behave in this world.",

Religion, as the Latin word denotes, is a careful and scrupulous observation of what Rudolf Otto aptly termed the numinosum, that is, a dynamic agency or effect not caused by an arbitrary act of will. A great many ritualistic performances are carried out for the sole purpose of producing at will the effect of the numinosum by means of certain devices of a magical nature, such as invocation, incantation, sacrifice, meditation and yoga practices, self-inflicted tortures of various descriptions, and so forth.",

      "abstract": "In this chapter we are considering the core of the unsophisticated-fused pattern of thought — the evolution of the child's view to that of the practical view of the untutored adult. In these views we do not find a high degree of conceptual separation between subjective and objective and space and substance. What conceptual separation develops depends on the use of symbols. In general, we can say that the growth and development of individuals and species is characterised by several interrelated processes: the increasing complexity of the organism, its increasingly complex assessment of its environment, and the increasingly complex interrelationships between the environment and the organism.1 In the earlier stages of development the organism's parts are not very specialised. There are few centres of organisation and control. The activities of the organism are not well integrated hierarchically and a few or even one action may often involve the entire body, so that the organism cannot attend to more than a limited number of things at a time. In such circumstances, an organism's actions are said to be global and syncretic.2 In later stages the actions become more discrete, differentiated, articulated and hierarchically integrated.3",

By so doing, they cross borders which make their own identity different from the previous state becoming a migrant, an exiled, a tourist, a helper or a conqueror. Border shows its difficulties in being unambiguously defined. For instance, to which of the contiguous areas it belongs? Neither one of the single-bounded regions is sufficient for that. Border is not just a non-place, but is a space with its own characteristics that makes living there very specific, regulating the dynamic with the surroundings and even the way of thinking, acting and feeling. Living in a borderland makes the identity of the inhabitants and their meaning-making process very peculiar. The way in which the border residents perceive the relationship between the self, the others and the environment, as well as their process of meaning-making is unavoidably linked with the existence of the border itself, with all its ambivalent theoretical features and practical implications in settling the daily activities and the human psychological functioning.",

Something similar can be said of interpersonal systems such as the family, the community, or whole societies, which must be capable of acquiring, transforming or transmitting, processing, and allocating resources and information among their human components. The way a social system performs these functions will affect power relations and condition the behaviors of its human components, but it is also true that people — both as individuals and through their organizations — affect their encompassing social, economic, and political environments. In responding to events and maintaining themselves, people alter their surroundings in ways that then push their lives in directions that often were not anticipated.

It suggests to please to appease, to be seductive to shape minds, to make other people share your values, to get international support...or the contrary. The success of the concept, in economics and geopolitics is symptomatic: the idea that you could gain power - that is, increase the probability that the other will behave in the way you wish - softly, without using violence or giving counterparts has everything to please the occidental elites. The soft power and the hope of expanding it to the rest of the world are appealing to those who have already tasted success from their political and economic position and to those who are not too dissatisfied with the world as it is. When a single word serves so many purposes, it legitimately raises ideological suspicions. Such ambiguities have a relationship with the evolution of the meaning of the word itself but also with its semantic ecology (the other words it replaces or generates) and with its mediology; that is, the material ways and means of such a spiritual process.",

When they are considered as his own, then is he called a natural person: and when they are considered as representing the words and actions of another, then is he a feigned or artificial person. 1 Hobbes' distinction between the two forms of personation may serve set forth the common ground, as well as mark the boundary, between two modes of theatricality: the sustaining of a feigned person-or mimicry-and the emphatic maintaining of one's own person, or self-manifestation. The Oxford Dictionary supplies similar coordinates for the verbs and act, which may mean either sustain a feigned character, make a pretence, act deceitfully -i. e., engage in mimicry or hypocrisy -or, more neutrally, pursue a course of action, to perform a function -to go about one's business in a normal manner. A man who has played his part has done what was expected of him; he has fulfilled the obligations contracted by performing similar actions in the past. But most men play their parts somewhat inexpertly; they fail coincide exactly with their assumed roles. And our language contains various expressions of disapproval for those who too grossly misplay themselves. Terms like showing off, playing the gallery, upstaging, making a scene, making a spectacle of oneself, all refer an insistence on being at the center of attention. The same notion appears in other languages: in Italian, for example, sta sempre sul podio -he's always on a platform -refers bitingly the man who cannot do without an audience.

(1) When an adult identifies with an infant or a child and directs appropriate emotional availability, the affect of dependence and attachment that the adult recognizes in the child is called amae (the prototype of the word). (2) When an adult has little empathy with the dependency or attachment shown by the child, the adult negatively perceives that the child is \"amaeru-ing.\" Experiencing such discommunications, the child begins to test adults to see if they have empathy with him or her. In other words, he or she begins to formulate certain psychological functions linked with amae such as reading other people's expressions—hitomishiri (stranger anxiety) or enryo (hesitation or reserve). (3) When the child is good at actively manipulating the emotions of adults and creates such a state of affect as to satisfy his or her dependence or attachment, he or she is said to be an amaeru-ing child. (4) When the child, although he or she is actually dependent on or loved by adults, denies the fact and behaves innocently or defiantly, the child is said to be in a state of amae. The usage of the word amae described above can be observed in exactly the same manner in interactions between adults.",

      "title": "Spiritual perspectives on the person with dementia: identity and personhood",
      "abstract": "In this chapter we consider contributions from spiritual and theological perspectives to the meaning of personal identity in the face of dementia. In contemporary health and social care literature there has been a growing interest in spirituality and stress has been laid on identifying and meeting the spiritual needs of people, particularly those with mental health problems, learning disabilities, and ill health in later life. Definitions of spirituality are elusive as are concepts of mind, meaning, and personhood—not least in the case of people with dementia.Spirituality is often described both as being about the intangible and immaterial aspects of life as well as being closely associated with a sense of meaning and purpose. It is particular to each person and yet, by virtue of its essential nature to all human beings, is shared with others. Some would say that spirituality is intuitive or even innate and, therefore, not easily susceptible to rational explication. Whilst it is sometimes described as being distinct from religion, arguably spirituality is essential to religion. One definition claims, people of all ages share basic human needs that include love (the giving and receiving of affection), faith (someone or something to believe in), hope (something to look forward to), peace (finding a measure of stability and tranquillity) and worship (a sense of awe and the attribution of value or ‘worth’ to whomever or whatever is deemed to merit it). (Jewell 1999, p. 10)Some of the circumstances of older age give a particular focus to these needs and values. Other definitions emphasize connectivity. Spirituality is an intra, inter and transpersonal experience that is shaped and directed by the experiences of individuals and the communities within which they live out their lives. (Swinton 2001, p. 20)Spirituality could be described as that which is essential to our humanity, embraces the desire for meaning and purpose, and has personal, social, and transcendent dimensions. The word ‘spirit’ comes from the Latin for breath and its equivalent in Hebrew and Greek, amongst other languages, similarly denotes that which is fundamental to life. To talk of spirituality, then, is to attempt to put into words things intimate and immanent as well as things other and transcendent.Spending time with people with dementia and their carers inevitably poses some basic questions about ourselves. Who am I and what is to become of me? What is the meaning and purpose of our lives? Such are the existential questions and dilemmas with which we are faced and which are often seen as funda mental to recent spiritual discourse. Historically, this discourse has taken place within the frameworks of faith traditions, where faith is both the means and the end of the spiritual quest. Clearly history bears witness to how religious faith, as the politics of spirituality, has not lived up to the ideals it has promulgated; fundamental concepts have been lost or diluted in practice. In a secular and post-modern environment, such history is often used as reason to cease taking underlying concepts seriously. Furthermore, post-Enlightenment philosophies have often rejected the premises of religious thought. That beliefs about who we are and what is to become of us can no longer be responded to in religious terms with any reasonable legitimacy or integrity is a notion we wish to challenge.The apparent renewal of interest in spirituality can be seen as indicative of a positive regard for the identity and personhood of people with dementia. We suggest it also reflects a sense of something essential that is missing from current theory and practice, which goes beyond specific considerations about people with dementia. Without understating the effects of dementia on either those diagnosed or their carers, it appears that people with dementia are showing us something of ultimate concern about the nature of personhood and creation. This is, perhaps, reflected in part by the recent focus on the personhood of people with dementia (Kitwood 1997).The way in which terms such as ‘individual’ and ‘person’ have been employed in both philosophical and religious thought over the centuries is being explored today, perhaps not so much to discover what has hitherto remained mysterious or unknown, but more in an attempt to recover that which has been lost in modern and post-modern thought, or indeed not developed adequately to sustain its case in the contemporary world of ideas.",

      "title": "Social being and cultural practices",
      "abstract": "Human societies are held together by relationships, conventions, traditions, institutions, and tacit understandings. These things are intangible, and while humans themselves are reproduced as corporeal beings, their societies are sustained by practical activities that continually recreate knowledge, customs, and interpersonal bonds. Just as a language would ultimately disappear if it ceased to be used as a means of communication, so the rules and routines of social life are maintained only if they are practised. The corollary of this is that societies are not fixed and bounded entities as much as arrangements that are continually coming into existence, works (if you like) that are never completed. But material things are also in flux, constantly ripening, maturing, being made, being used consecutively in different ways through their ‘lifespans’, eroding and decaying: so that the social and substantial worlds are as one in being in an unending state of becoming. Nonetheless, objects often have the capacity to endure longer than habits, rules, or affiliations. They continue to exist independently of human beings and their actions. As a result, old artefacts and places occupied in the past can serve to give structure to current practices and transactions, providing cues and prompts, or reminding us of past events and appropriate modes of conduct. Hunter-gatherers have generally lived a way of life that involves making continual reference to natural features and landmarks. Certain distinctive cliffs, hills, islands, trees, and lakes have represented places to return to, or at which to arrange meetings or encounter game. As such they will have been places of periodic resort, and were incorporated into collective history and mythology. Meanwhile, other places acquired a meaning simply because specific people camped there, or met there, or died there. During the Mesolithic in Britain, some locations seem to have been persistently returned to over very long periods of time. One example is the site at North Park Farm, Bletchingley in Surrey, which appears to have been visited sporadically over hundreds of years, although the structural evidence for this at the site was sparse, being limited to a group of fireplaces.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The striving for and experience of freedom are of central importance in human life. Our concern here is not freedom as a characteristic of a social (political) system or as a social value, but the experience of external and internal freedom in the natural surroundings of everyday life. There are situations that offer little restraint, in terms of both physical obstacles and social pressures. In such a situation a person experiences external freedom: If one wanted to, one could leave the situation or do something different within the situation without an effort to overcome physical obstacles and/or without being blamed (punished) by social agents. Thus, the concept of external freedom implies both being able and being allowed to do what one wants to do. There are, on the other hand, situations or activities that one can leave or change without acting against one’s personal norms, and feeling guilty. In this case we speak of internal freedom. In this sense, a person, even if experiencing an irresistible impulse to act in a certain way, is internally free to act if the desire is fully compatible with his or her values, that is, if he or she does not have to overcome anticipated feelings of guilt.",

These characteristics, inherent to human person’s being, are derived of the substantial unity of spiritual soul and body, and they bestow human beings with a special dignity, which must be reflected in the way each one assumes his or her own existence, and how he/she is treated and respected by others. Indeed, the human person’s dignity confers personal rights and duties, among which is found, in a preeminent place, the unconditioned respect to every innocent human life (one’s one as well as others’). Therefore, the human being’s death and its surrounding period demand profound respect and to be treated according to such dignity, which allows every one to face this step with a maximum of decorum and integrity. While euthanasia represents a manner of facing death which disclaims human life’s inviolability and, hence, attempts against the human person’s dignity, on the other hand, palliative care counts nowadays with very efficacious tools to alleviate suffering and to attend human beings in this crucial step of life in consonance with the dignity of which they are endowed.",

      "abstract": "For Shangjun Shu`s author(s), cosmos moves by exact causality according to mechanical laws of sciences, leaving no place for the transcendent, moral, or spiritual, and these laws could be utilized by human beings, to infallibly manipulate everything and every other human being in the world, to overcome the eternal “human nature” utterly egoist and amoral, and to overcome the limited freedom or spontaneity human beings possess by default, that has caused the “human nature” to manifest in great varieties. As a result, human beings can never hope for any moral capacity or ethical status, and human relations can never be genuinely ethical or political. The Book of Lord Shang is thus Purely about natural sciences and engineering, but never one about ethics, politics, economy, warfare, laws, or any other “human” studies that Must be built on acknowledgement of human beings as ethically viable. The “prince” in an existing “state”, then, has no choice other than treating himself as the sole ends of himself, for all his intentions and actions will be egoist at the root despite his apparent thoughts. So he must maximize his own security and freedom among Mankind hopelessly amoral, by completely subduing and exploiting all other human beings and the entire natural world, for his own benefits. Success of this plan then requires total compliance to sciences, to program by numerical accuracy all behaviors of other human beings and all natural phenomena, in order to completely monitor and exploit them. These programs then form an overall Algorithm, that solves the problem for maximum security and freedom of the “prince”; and this algorithm, in turn, makes the whole “state” it deploys through, consisting of all human beings and natural exploited to serve the “prince”, an exactly structured and synchronized machine. As nature has no randomness, and even the default human freedom or spontaneity could be reliably suppressed by sciences, this machine is then automatic, and even the “prince” should not interfere with its fully programmed operations. A “Rule of Algorithm” is thus planned, to resemble “good governance” in all manners; despite the fact, that it is not ethical and political at all, thus no “Rule” in genuine sense, so human beings reduced to mechanical parts in it will be mass-murdered for its routine maintainance, and likely exterminated when no they are longer needed. However, it would still be able to, with behavioral sciences, cause people to submit willingly, and could even, by the worldview of Lord Shang, proclaim mass-murder of its human parts as a grace; and it may finally, as a historical tradition found in theory and practice in far more times and places than the Book of Lord Shang, and resurge in the future with its timeless, terrible promises.",

Infants endow people and other animate beings with the capacity to act: They cause their own motion, interact with objects on contact, detect objects and obstacles at a distance, direct their actions to distant objects, and act efficiently. Even before infants begin to reach for objects, pick them up, or manipulate them, they view other people’s actions on objects as causal, costly, and goal-directed. Based on these findings, the author hypothesizes that infants have an early-emerging system of core knowledge of people as agents. This system supports infants’ learning about other people’s actions and mental states, as well as the development of their own motor skills and action plans.",

The organization gathers, with a view to a unitary action, bearing the same vector, people, tools, vehicles, and financial resources, cognitions and projects. Even if it always acts unitary, according to a plan derived from putting into practice some policies, strategies, this composition made up of people, money, materials and vehicles is just an agglutination of tangible and intangible, from which may results either a coherent, performing action, and therefore efficient or an incoherent and not performing action which means the destruction or abolishment of that organization. Between these two extremes, somewhere around tangible and intangible, the human being imagines, builds and creates endless possible things and ideals that are to be changed into material things.",

      "title": "The Problem of Social Evaluation",
      "abstract": "i E WANT what we want because V V we want it, is the epigram matic conclusion to which a brilliant young sociologist has been driven by the conflicting variety of human interests. This is the best that he can do with the problem of human values. He observes that unconditioned reflexes are extremely rare in human behavior; that the human nervous system is indefinitely plastic; and that history displays all sorts of different, not to say contradictory, culture systems. There is nothing conceivable but what somebody can be found to desire it; there being persons who even want to die. There have been customs so cruel and revolting that their prevalence seems almost incredible; and yet societies have believed in them devoutly, and practiced them even to their own ultimate destruction. And who shall be the judge of what a person or a society wants if not that person or society itself? The results of a given line of behavior can in a measure be predicted; the causal sequences of human activities are phenomena for scientific treatment. But not their value! That is a personal and subjective matter, as variable as human whims, and as plastic as the human nervous system. The problem of human values is therefore one which the strict scientist, this young scholar believes, will do well to eschew entirely, as solipsistic and subjective-hopelessly! But to abandon a whole field of important phenomena seems like a strange obeisance for the devotees of science to offer to their deity. One who adopts the position outlined above should at least recognize this logical consequence, and admit it as consistently as other behaviorists are wont to do. For, as Dr. Cooley has so clearly pointed out in a recent article, we have in our world two entirely different kinds of facts: material facts in space, and mentalsocial facts in consciousness. Science deals with the former; measuring their time and space associations, and inferring their causal relationships. But mental-social facts can not be gotten at directly; but only indirectly, through the objective behavior symbols by which they are dramatized and represented. They are not, therefore, amenable to the ordinary techniques of natural science. It may be questioned whether our knowledge of mental-social facts can ever be scientific, in the sense that our knowledge of material facts in space is. This is the valid core of behaviorism; though it is absurd for behaviorists to deny the existence of consciousness. Even though our knowledge of this subjective sort of phenomena must come through introspection, sympathetic intuition, and art, it need be none the less abundant and informing on that account. Now values, the root idea of which is purpose (as contrasted with the categories of time, space, number, cause, and so forth), are phenomena of the mental-social sort. Strictly speaking, therefore, there can be a science of human values only indirectly, through a study of the objective symbols and expressions of value. Accordingly our problem is to find that characteristic behavior by which needs, purposes, satisf;actions, values, are dramatized and represented. Such behavior may then be subjected to a treatment as closely scientific as the data will permit. And we may be confident that the findings will prove of great practical utility; even though the data for demonstrable conclusions be rather meagre, and absolute finality for-",

However, in co-creative design processes, these bodies can be understood as extreme-users and are welcomed for their diversity and empowerment. Artefacts similarly undergo inclusion and exclusion in creative and productive processes. Therefore, the stigmatisation and standardisation of human and artificial bodies are made explicit in extreme-users, whose importance in design processes lies in addressing them with no negative differentiation with respect to ordinary users, implying that objects’ flaws would be embedded as identity and semantics. This paper questions the dualism of perfection/imperfection attributed to bodies and artefacts by normalising domains, and expects to corroborate design as a social activism tool for catalysing the paradigm of inclusion.",

      "abstract": "According to a Zulu proverb a human being can only become truly human because of others. Each person can only become more human, more himself- regardless of his sex - through the co-involvement of others. It is the love for one’s neighbour and the respect one has for him/her as a person which makes one consider the other party's feelings, viewpoints and circumstances. In order to arrive at a situation of peaceful coexistence it is important to realize that human attitudes and a mature life style evolve through a process of learning and interaction with others. It is a timeconsuming and costly process which starts at infancy and continues throughout someone's life. Instruction concerning interpersonal relations and the teaching of respect cannot be confined to individual lessons or working sessions at home or in school. Discussions and conversations concerning interpersonal relations need to form an integral and natural part of a child’s life within the home environment and throughout the pupil's school career. It is senseless if educators talk about the importance of teaching respect only to reveal disrespectful behaviour themselves, or to talk about the importance of self-esteem in the paying of respect whilst causing children to feel negative about themselves. To be able to express respect to other human beings, one needs to be respected. A child needs to experience how it feels when homage is paid. The following rule of life applies in this regard: one can never give if one has never received respect.",

Adults are “such moral creatures,” he wrote, “that we invariably react to any generalization regarding human behavior … with questions of immediate applicability to conduct.”1 Judging others quickly, adults neglect to ask what human needs they might understand if, on witnessing others’ behavior, they would first try to understand the meaning of such behavior. Instead, they draw conclusions, assign blame, and prescribe remedies. By middle age in particular, superego development has taken its adult as prisoner, leading adults to fear that in their expected-to-be-perfect state, they are far from being as good as they should be, as far as childhood is now distant from the self. As Erikson had illustrated in his prejudice imagery, this leads to self-judgment, to the magnifying of others’ quirks, and to the defensive projection of real or feared flaws onto others. Observed flaws are one’s negative identity; they come from and are deflected backward onto the accusing self.",

Were the social dangers posed by these transactions really a matter for concern, surely the attempt should first be made to understand the conditions that foster them. For unless interest in obscenity is assumed to be innate, a trait of human nature, there should be an explanation for it in the variable conditions (the repressions—or, perhaps, on the other hand, the creative impulses) that impinge on the more authentic and so non-prurient traits of human nature. It's too bad—probably—that people find (or feel obliged to find) gratification in obscenity.

From the XVIth century and during all the XVIIth, it enlarges its uses as far as it becomes the notion we can't avoid nor refute nowadays. Through the study of its most important promoters, from Guichardin to Leibniz, and assuming that its introduction provides a solution that enables them to work out new problems they have to face, this work shows that the notion of interest is not a psychological motivation that would lead to the representation of a selfish man nor to the mere introduction of the utilitarian paradigm. The analysis of its uses (whether it's used to solve economic, moral or political problems), of its objects and subjects, of its qualities (either descriptive or normative, either particular or general) and of its ambivalent effects (utility, prejudice), enables to show that its stake is wider, in so far as the modelling of the reality is concerned. Interest works as a principle of action, as a corrective variable. It allows to get the phenomenons under control, to get a phenomenal representation of the relationships between the man and his world around. Its extension leads to an upgrading of tangible world, that gives the representation of value a new start, and appraises them throughout concurrence. Therefore, it takes part in the construction of modernity.",

      "abstract": "There are three lines of approach to the study of the function of cortin the vital hormone of the adrenal cortex; one, through the effects of deprivation, a second through the effects of replacement in deficient subjects, and the third through the action of cortin in normal subjects. The most striking results occur when there is a deficiency of the hormone. In experimental adrenal insufficiency symptoms develop which indicate marked changes in the functions of many tissues of the body. Animals with both adrenals removed not only become fatigued easily when they undertake exercise, but they show a disinclination for exercise. Loss of appetite appears sooner or later, with or without vomiting, and there may be hemorrhages from the mueosa of the alimentary canal or elsewhere. As the animals become worse, they lose interest in their surroundings, finally passing into a state of inertia which verges upon coma or they become easily irritated and may appear irrational (wandering about aimlessly from one place to another without being satisfied anywhere), finally passing into coma, from which they are roused with difficulty. Just preceding or alternating with coma, twitching, heightened motor activity, and even convulsions sometimes occur. The blood urea rises and the blood sugar may fall. Although the changes seem to be coming on gradually, collapse may occur suddenly. In addition to the symptoms described for animals, in man other symptoms evident are pain in the legs, back or abdomen; insomnia and mental depression; poor judgment; failure of memory and lack of cooperation. With the administration of cortin the symptoms tend to disappear in the reverse order of their appearance; coma being replaced by heightened muscular irritability, as shown by increased motor activity, aimless movements, twitching and marked myotatic response to stimuli.",

People in a society might agree on what is moral behaviour in some circumstances, and disagree in others. Different societies have different agreements, different moralities with different ethical ways of living; and different groups in a particular society might have different moralities with different ethical ways of living. We, from our own social perspective, might not find other moralities acceptable – be those the moralities of other societies or of other groups within our society – and there are basic questions of how we accommodate moralities not our own, or which is the “correct” morality. There are those who think they know what is right and what is wrong, and others who take a more nuanced approach, though they might prefer a certain morality/ideology. On the one hand, Adam Smith, for example, knew there was a true morality which came from God (or the Deity) and thus cultural relativism was based on an incorrect premise – “Part III, Chapter V: Of the influence and authority of the general Rules of Morality, and that they are justly regarded as the Laws of the Deity” [Smith(1759, 1790)]. In a famous/infamous article, Francis Fukuyama when discussing the natures of different types of society (fascist, communist, democratic) made the ideological difference almost one of morality, and he foresaw the ultimate dominance of the morality/ideology of “economic and political liberalism”. He argued that, when talking about changes in communist societies, commentators “sense dimly that there is some larger process at work, a process that gives coherence and order to the daily headlines.” (“The End of History?”, The National Interest, Summer 1989).

The English word “morality”—in the limited sense of pertaining to behavior as good (right, correct, worthy, virtuous) versus bad (wrong, incorrect, unworthy, vicious)—expresses a universal concept or distinction shared perhaps by all languages, whether modern or ancient. Long before the earliest written use of concepts like “morality” and “humanity” in religious and administrative contexts, oral cultures stretching far back into prehistory distinguished between good and bad action. For many dozens of millennia, groups of Homo sapiens understood themselves as connected to but also differing from other types of beings: other groups of people, ancestors, spirits and divinities, animals and plants, mountains and bodies of water, etc. Morality—doing things well or badly, correctly or incorrectly, generously or selfishly, appropriately or inappropriately—was perceived anthropomorphically, as extending to many types of entities (e.g., a tale about an animal or divinity acting badly).",

Yes – the weal and woe of another touches us directly: the mere happiness of another pleases us in the telling: even that of fictional persons whose tale we know of, or in distant ages – this common concern is so great that it collides with the self-interested feeling. The sense of it is indeed a noble feeling, nobler than the self-interested one. Nobody despises it: everyone wishes for it, though not all have it in the same degree; in some it is great, and the greater it is, the more it is felt as a perfection. It is universal, though seldom so great that it inspires active exertions – in misers, for example, with whom self-interest has become very strong. As needy beings the creator gave us self-interest in our own perfection. As beings who have the power to be of service to our fellows, He gave us a disinterested concern for the perfection of others. The concern for others ranks high, since even the concern for self can be subordinated to it, but not vice versa. The more self-interested, the poorer (at least in thought), and hence the more to be despised. The disinterested feeling for the welfare, etc., of another has our own perfection, not as an end, but as a means.",

      "abstract": "Currently, we can observe a crisis of self and its respective weak ties with a group and lack of community bonds. All these make it that on the one hand there is a need for professional help, and on the other the effectiveness of such help is rated as low. The manners of empowering both he person, group and community are sought. We deal with such empowerment, among other things, at the level of self-help groups. Yet the source of that success should be sought not so much in the phenomenon of a group as in the very person and his activity. It is the person who thanks to his indispensable abilities can overcome biological and social limitations. Owing to self-help activity the person develops his abilities and frees himself from the sense of helplessness, powerlessness and hopelessness. The phenomenon of self-help activity requires that a new role and competence of the psychologist (and not only him) be defined in relation with self-help groups. On the one hand, he must be capable of arousing confidence in particular persons and groups to himself, to his own competencies, to use their own resources. On the other hand, he must be able to organize, facilitate and animate those social processes in which the division into the giving and the taking will be overcome. The reconstruction of a sense of community that is well underway in the self-help groups is an initial condition by which to join the broader trend of constructive social activities.",

      "abstract": "Uncovering the red herring in Schrodinger's cat thought experiment: Singular measurements of attributes (called properties) of particles or objects are relative. That is, they come from the relation with the particle or object under consideration rather than being sole property of it, by itself ( independently of the measurement relations). Measurables such as orientation of rotation, velocity, energy, momentum are relational. What the state or value is found to be depends upon the relation with the observed or measured entity by which a singular outcome is obtained. (/e/ viewpoint or apparatus and method employed). Or at the macroscopic scale, when vision or hearing is involved the relation to the potential sensory stimuli, signals received and processed into what is seen.) Whereas an intrinsic state of being is not relational but independent. A decayed and non decayed particle are different from each other because the decayed particle has lost something compared to the un-decayed and is therefore not an identical system to the un-decayed. It might be regarded as a different object because that change has happened. A shattered flask of poison is not the same as an intact flask of poison. The shards of glass are different objects from the intact flask object. It is not a matter of relative perspective. Likewise dead and alive cat. The live cat has functioning metabolism, the dead does not. Which is not a matter of relative perspective but intrinsic difference in state of being. The change to the objects in the thought experiment make it dis-similar to the scenarios in quantum experiments.",

      "abstract": "Abstract During the last century it has often been argued that mind emerges from matter. Values, on the other hand, were rather thought to be (merely) supervenient. However, it seems reasonable to conclude that values are at least conceptually (or epistemically) emergent on neutral facts. This process of emergence, of course, is a temporal process. It may have taken a long time for certain values to arise, and they presuppose conscious memory and expectation. Moreover, even when constituted, values involve time. They do so mainly in two ways. Firstly, by having a temporal aspect, as in certain moral virtues and obligations. Secondly, by having time itself as their object. Examples can be seen in religion (sacred/secular time), economy (“time is money”, time can be cheap or expensive, wasted or gained), sport (priority), science (idem) and art (rhythm and related properties).",

      "abstract": "This article deals with systems at multiple levels, at least from cell to organization. It also deals with learning, decision making, and other behavior at multiple levels. Technological development of a human behavioral ecosystem appropriate to space environments requires an analytic and synthetic orientation, explicity experimental in nature, dictated by scientific and pragmatic considerations, and closely approximating procedures of established effectiveness in other areas of natural science. The conceptual basis of such an approach has its roots in environmentalism which has two main features: (1) knowledge comes from experience rather than from innate ideas, divine revelation, or other obscure sources; and (2) action is governed by consequences rather than by instinct, reason, will, beliefs, attitudes or even the currently fashionable cognitions. Without an experimentally derived data base founded upon such a functional analysis of human behavior, the overgenerality of “ecological systems” approaches render them incapable of ensuring the successful establishment of enduring space habitats. Without an experimentally derived functional account of individual behavioral variability, a natural science of behavior cannot exist. And without a natural science of behavior, the social sciences will necessarily remain in their current status as disciplines of less than optimal precision or utility. Such a functional analysis of human performance should provide an operational account of behavior change in a manner similar to the way in which Darwin's approach to natural selection accounted for the evolution of phylogenetic lines (i.e., in descriptive, nonteleological terms). Similarly, as Darwin's account has subsequently been shown to be consonant with information obtained at the cellular level, so too should behavior principles ultimately prove to be in accord with an account of ontogenetic adaptation at a biochemical level. It would thus seem obvious that the most productive conceptual and methodological approaches to long-term research investments focused upon human behavior in space environments will require multidisciplinary inputs from such wide-ranging fields as molecular biology, environmental physiology, behavioral biology, architecture, sociology, and political science, among others.",

      "abstract": "<b><i></i></b> A collector is a person who collects things on purpose, either as a hobby or business, or for personal satisfaction, e.g., stamp, coin, or art collector. In such instances, the act of collecting things represents voluntary, controlled, goal-directed, selective searching. Pathologic patterns of collecting have been observed following brain damage, particularly frontal lobe damage, ranging from a tendency to grasp (prehension behavior) to an irrepressible need to seize surrounding objects and store them (hoarding behavior). These adnormal behaviors express an excessive adherence to environmental stimuli but in no way express a planned process directed toward specific items. In this article, we describe an unusual pattern of pathologic collecting behavior due to frontal lobe damage: involuntary irrepressible collecting that is goal-directed and selective. The authors report a patient who collected specifically household electrical appliances following a bilateral damage of orbito- and polar-prefrontal cortex. The patient had involuntary irrepressible collecting that was goal-directed and selective. This “forced collectionism” is different from that of the usual collectionism encountered in patients with frontal lobe lesions, as the latter is in no way a planned process directed toward specific items.",

      "abstract": "In Great Expectation, its main characters are frequently in a forced dialogue condition. The desire to make the other listen and the desire to make the other speak are dominant in this forced dialogue situation Dialogue does not arise from the various individual points of view, but demonstrates a social field of pressures and disproportions. Dialogue as free, voluntary, and interactive behaviour is put into question in this text. Social codes and contracts are overwhelming enough to overshadow its characters, which blocks the possibilities of open, genuine and unconstrained dialogue. Great Expectations explores the field of sado-masochistic coercion and challenges the conception of man as a spontaneous and creative being. Its characters are less than free human individuals and under the tight social control and total manipulations of power, instead of being presented as fully-featured alive human being cbaractenstics. \nCharacters take no absolute freedom, being always limited and restrained even when they confess. Dostoevskian liberty is refuted in the forced power field; the social contract never allows a fully liberating spiritual situation. Instead of celebrating transcendental freedom, Great Expectations presents secular scenes based upon social contract and coercion Legal institutional power dominates the contracted in the coercive field of force. Those who are under observation and psychological pressure are forced to speak against their will. Great Expectations invites a contemplation of dialogue as forceful inquisition, which challenge, interactive and communicative power. In this context, Great Expectations is sharply different from a conventional novel based on psychological and moral insight.",

      "abstract": "As long as we are awake and even while dreaming, a sense of “I am seeing, hearing, or doing, etc.” seems to be an inevitable content of any conscious experience. One may wonder whether it is ever possible in our ordinary lives to have an experience where the “I” is not present, or briefly, have a self-transcendent experience.  I describe below a few of my experiences of short duration that are quite ordinary with nothing mysterious about them and argue that they are all self-transcendent.  To explain how the self (ego) is present or not in an experience, I describe some properties characteristic of the self such as its sense of personal identity and ownership of action.  Manifestation of these properties in an experience indicates the presence of the self and absence of these properties indicates its absence.  In an act of observation, full attention paid to what is being observed seems to push every thought, including the self, out of the conscious mind and keep it fully occupied with the act of observation.  A characteristic property of the self-transcendent state seems to be that one can only recognize such a state as being free from the self, but one cannot prove that it is so because the outward effect of the state may be the same as that of an alternative state where the self is present.",

Nevertheless, in its popular acceptation, the term is limited to that form of freely written characters usually adopted by one person in sending messages to another person. In its restricted sense, therefore, handwriting may be considered as the written speech of the individual; like his oral efforts-and, indeed, like his every act-it soon becomes impressed with characteristics peculiar to himself, and tending to differentiate him from all other individuals. This establishes for him a customary and distinctive style, in writing, which may be more or less varied, from time to time, by accidental causes, such as haste, carelessness, position in writing, excitement, weakness, or disease. A writer's style gradually becomes so much a part of his nature that the physical act of writing is then scarcely a conscious effort on his part, but is rather an automatic production, resulting from his mere mental determination to write. This almost unconscious production includes (inter alia) two distinct parts, viz.: the physical method of performing the act, and the pictorial forms resulting from such performance; of these two divisions, ordinarily but few of the details of the first are (or can be) known to the person using them, and many of the details of the second are also unknown to him.",

The more independent his personality, and the more pronounced his will, the harder he will collide with standards. He finds that here—long before his arrival on the scene—the whole area has been mapped out, and he is not as free to manoeuvre as he expected. At every turn he comes up against standards, existing arrangements, predetermined dimensions—all of which force him to depart from his original ideas in one direction or another. To him they all represent a sizable obstacle, and he is not at all sure that the disadvantages offered by these standards are balanced out by corresponding advantages; anyone surveying the whole field of standards, and aware of their shortcomings, will have some sympathy for this view.",

      "abstract": "Ever since Plato introduced his allegory of the charioteer, where one horse is passion, the other is motivation, and the charioteer is reason, thinkers have captured conduct of life as a conflict between passion and reason. Theorists distinguished between human nature, which acts on impulses, and acts derived from reason-based morality (see Dewey 2012/1922). Humans often act on impulses that do not comply with what they themselves think would be best. Some eat too much, drink too much, or have romantic adventures they later regret. People who forget about the consequences of their actions and act based on their feelings may experience unsatisfactory results. For example, couples divorce due to a shattered relationship despite the shattered finances that follow suit. On the other hand, decision makers sometimes know that a course of action may have disastrous consequences if they follow their gut feeling. That is why employees do not walk away from their job when they are angry at their boss. Sometimes, however, it is good to act on gut feelings. For example, job applicants feel negatively about an option they think would be best. That is why people may reject a job offer that would yield a higher income and better career prospects; they feel uncomfortable at the job interview, a sign that the job has some drawbacks. Finally, although attitudes have been defined as consisting of cognitive, affective, and behavioral components (Krech, Crutchfield, and Ballachey 1962; Rosenberg and Hovland 1960), there is ample evidence for a lack of correspondence among these components of attitudes (Wicker 1969; Zanna and Rempel 1988). For example, people think of themselves as environmentalists but drive cars, produce unnecessary garbage or fly to distant conference destinations to give speeches about how to curb climate change.",

Among the basic constituents of all these features is the insight into one's own limitations: to be wise and humble presupposes that one knows what one cannot do or be, whereas grace is the manifestation of that which moves oneself beyond what one thought it was possible to do or be, due to unforeseen and unanticipated elements in the reality in which one takes part. Hence, wisdom, humility, and grace must all be seen as conditions for (pre-)human agency, building on psychological and other evolved capacities.

Only a tender soul is the store house of affection. A soul that has already been hardened seldom shows affection. Affection is guided by emotion. As such affection is a disease. It is one kind of mental state or a mental disposition. Thus it signifies a person’s natural qualities of mind and character. Mother is always affectionate but father may not be so. Indulgence is the state of being allowed whatever one wants. It overlooks faults. It is the action or habit of satisfying one’s own or other people’s desires. Indulgence allows oneself to enjoy the pleasure of something. It is to become involved in an activity, especially one that is illegal or disapproved of. It is to satisfy an interest, a desire, etc..Sacrament is any of several rituals in the Roman Catholic, Anglican and other Christian Churches through which Christians believe they are specially blessed by God. The sacrament of baptism is the striking example of it. Indulgence is the remission of unishment in purgatory, still due for sins even after sacramental absolution. Thus absolution is a formal declaration, especially in a Christian Church, by a priest that a person’s sins have been forgiven. Forgiveness is a great virtue. To forgive is divine. A sinner is rectified through pardon. Only a lucky soul can follow that immortal light.",

Feeling contempt thus implies rejecting others, considering others as unworthy of one’s attention. Contempt is often mixed with other emotions, such as anger, hatred, or socio-moral disgust. Often therefore, the expression of contempt can coincide with feelings of revenge or even attempts to attack the other person. I think contempt is a moral emotion, in that it is often elicited in response to transgressions that are considered as amoral. These include behaviors such as betrayal, theft, (sexual) violence, which go against our moral standards and therefore deserve only contempt. These types of transgressions are too awful to criticize, and therefore can only lead to rejection or exclusion. Although we may feel contempt towards people we hardly know, contempt often develops out of anger, especially when we have been confronted with others or other groups who have not changed their behavior in reaction to our anger. Anger therefore does not seem functional, and contempt emerges as a way of coping with the lack of influence or control we have over the other.",

      "abstract": "Teaching ritual is incredibly difficult because the subject is so vast with no general agreement on the basics, including what ritual is, how it works, what it feels like to perform a ritual or participate in one, and what its functions are. On the one hand, ritual is allied with the “sacred,” another difficult concept to define. On the other, evolutionary biologists find human ritual rooted in animal behavior. Which came first, the activity or the meanings attached to the activity? There is agreement that rituals are repetitive, rhythmic actions. But so is factory work and obsessive behavior—which have also been called ritual or “ritual-like” (whatever that means). There are the public rituals of the state and church; the social rituals of families, clubs, professions, and identity groups; and the more or less private rituals of small groups, couples, and individuals. It is not easy to specify what these share or to distinguish among them. Many acts are upgraded to ritual status because ritual is a positive value word, linking an activity to the sacred, another positive value word. But rituals can also be negative or bad, if they are associated with groups such as the Nazis, devil worshippers, and other pariahs.",

      "abstract": "There’s growing evidence that psychosis is linked to the physical environments that we live in. Good environments are the ones that allow people to step back, relax and feel secure, while engaging in interesting and meaningful activity. Bad environments don’t allow respite: they keep people on their toes and somehow magnify meaninglessness and hollow rules and unreasonable demands. They may also be bleak and even unfair or outright scary. But don’t expect everyone to notice the bad environments: recent studies demonstrate that patients with psychosis are far more likely to notice even subtle negative features in the environment than people without symptoms. The same patients are also less likely to notice the good things an environment has to offer – but that doesn’t mean they shouldn’t be provided.",

Everyone assumes that a person's beliefs may be, to some extent, ascertained by seeing how he acts: for we suppose that he will do the things which he believes will fulfil his wishes, and avoid doing what he thinks will frustrate them. Similarly, his desires may, to some extent, be ascertained by seeing how he acts; for if we know what he thinks about the results of his actions, we suppose that the expected results are desired or not disliked and those believed unlikely are disliked or undesired. We have three variables, conduct, desire, and belief; and we suppose that there is some equation by which the first in conjunction with one of the others implies a determinate value of the third. In principle, it should be equally possible to deduce conduct from belief and desire. But that seems of less metaphysical interest, because we think of actions as open to observation in a straightforward way, whereas we are more dubious about beliefs and desires.",

      "title": "Self-Transcendence",
      "abstract": "Abstract Self-transcendence is the process by which a person becomes aware of their participation in something greater than their individual self. The conscious realization of participation in something beyond yourself, such as union with nature, humanity, or God, evokes positive emotions, particularly joy and awe, which are often combined with attitudes of humility and reverence. The cultivation of self-transcendence provides a coherent perspective on living that promotes physical, mental, and spiritual well-being. If we accept that virtue involves respect for the dignity of others and not just one’s individual self, then the cultivation of self-transcendence is essential to all aspects of virtue. In this chapter, we provide several lines of empirical evidence about human nature, ecological systems, well-being, and virtue that provide a solid foundation to guide clinical practice in promoting health. Prospective studies indicate that the cultivation of self-transcendence and well-being involves the dynamic interplay of three processes: the awakening of plasticity (i.e., being able and willing to change); virtue (i.e., having intuitive insight into what is good for a person’s self and others); and creative functioning (i.e., being innovative, purposeful and responsible so that our habits are congruent with our goals and values). The cultivation of self-transcendence by these three processes describes the essential features of the path to a life that is healthy, happy, and good. We describe evidence-based practices that are effective in motivating people to create opportunities for their own well-being and that of others by cultivating self-transcendence.",

      "title": "FALSE RECOGNITION OF UNFAMILIAR PEOPLE: \"SEEING FILM STARS EVERYWHERE\"",
      "abstract": "Abstract A patient (MR) is reported who is able to correctly recognise famous people as being familiar but has a strong tendency to falsely recognise unfamiliar people as being familiar. False recognition does not depend on the type of person involved (contemporary, historical, fictional) or the modality in which it is presented (face, spoken/written name). False recognition does not extend to vocabulary knowledge, to other proper name categories (e.g. places) or to news events. Several hypotheses are considered but discounted. False recognition does not reflect reliance on familiarity associated with parts of the stimuli as opposed to the whole. False recognition, instead, depends critically on the nature of the referent (i.e. whether it refers to a person or not) and not on the nature of the stimulus material. Thus, MR will not produce false recognition when asked to search for names that refer to song or book titles even when, in all other respects, the stimuli resemble the names of people (e.g. Eleanor Rigby, David Copperfield). It is suggested that this disorder stems from a top-down failure to regulate the person recognition system, such that inappropriate information is retrieved. The category specificity may reflect inappropriate use of meta-memory knowledge concerning the rate of potential new exemplars from the category of \"people\" relative to other categories.",

For example, when I kick a rock, I do not do anything wrong, nor is the rock wronged. On the other hand, if I kicked an innocent child, I do something wrong, but more importantly I wrong the child. I argue that sentience (the capacity to feel pleasure and pain) and rational autonomy (the conscious capacity to self-govern) are both individually sufficient for moral standing and disjunctively necessary for moral standing. I argue against a variety of alternative positions such as consciousness (the capacity to have any experience such as the color blue), biological life, and dispositional agency, in order to strengthen my position. Moral status refers to the set of normative features governing the way we treat those with moral standing. When it comes to moral status regarding moral patients, I argue that they have at least two kinds of basic moral interests which are based on their wellbeing and their autonomy. I argue in favor of a hierarchical system of moral status whereby moral patients and agents possess higher, weaker, or equal moral status based on their capacities. I conclude by arguing that we may have impersonal obligations (moral obligations owed to no moral patient) towards the environment because the natural environment may be a possible source of beauty. Thus, our moral obligation would be to beauty rather than the environment itself.",

The word “professional” has a number of connotations. It ranges from the description applied by the sporting amateur (with perhaps a slight air of condescension or self righteousness) to one who quite frankly earns his living by the exercise of his aptitude in some particular sport, to the practitioners of vocations hallowed by antiquity and revered because of their one-time remoteness from the common herd. To be a “professional” is to use a facility for sames or sport for a living; and in consequence to be regarded with something only a little better than horror by the “amateurs.” To be a “professional man” or “woman,” or to be a member of one of the “professions” implies a standing, in some eyes, only a little less than divine and certainly very far removed from the taint of “professionalism” as applied to sport.",

      "abstract": "There is much to be said in favour of the idea that anticipation and the preemption and deception which it permits play an important role in the social life of both humans and a number of other primates. This idea has been developed anew, particularly for the human case, in a number of different disciplines for a variety of different reasons. Goody (this volume), points to a number of instances, and the list could be extened almost ad nauseam. It ranges from computer scientists proposing plan-construction algorithms and user-modelling procedures for natural language front-ends, to economists speculating on the actions of economic agents planning their moves in the market-place with respect to the actions of others. The scope and explanatory range of this idea in any of these fields has always been questionable. In economics, for example, the very different effects of ignorance, habit and culture on individual choice have often been far greater than those of individual ratiocination. Nevertheless, any area of human activity which involves actual or potential interaction with other humans (and that might mean all of human life) can be seen to have characteristics which reveal an anticipation of how others will view and respond to one's actions.",

      "abstract": "Co-Adaptation of Assistive Mobility Devices and Residential Functions Thomas Bock, Thomas Linner, Christos Georgoulas Abstract: Purpose For facilitating an independent living for elderly or disabled people, a method has been developed at TUM Building Realization and Robotics Lab, which aims at creating intelligent living environments by adjusting mobility sys-tems and everyday objects (e.g. appliances) as modular and complementary subsystems1. The proposed system com-prises an intelligent wheelchair, which enables simplified use of the bath-room, kitchen and living room, etc. It can dock at certain functions, e.g. the toilet, both on a physical and information technology level. Method Studies show that the major problem for people with physical and/ or cognitive disabilities in everyday routine and in managing the Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) is the surmounting of different height levels and distances. Even for a person with a good physical fitness, it is extremely difficult or even impossible to transfer from a wheelchair onto a couch autonomously. The reason is the height difference between the furniture and wheelchair, as well as the space or gap that occurs mostly between the transport device and the piece of furniture. The proposed work presents a thorough research study, which enabled a huge gain in knowledge, concerning the re-design of household appliances and devices, in order for them to be straight-forwardly and cost effectively integrated with mobility supporting robots2. The outcome of this research, led to the partici-pation on a research project which involves 7 companies and 3 universities. In order to realize the co-adaptation of an assistive mobility device and residential functions, the following development approach steps were followed: i) research and identification of needs, ii) definition of requirements, iii) identification of technologies and processes, iv) initial con-cept, v) experiment in real environment, vi) final concept and further development roadmap. Results & Discussion Most wheelchairs are designed with a fixed height and do not provide features for altering their elevation level. Addition-ally, handicapped individuals face major problems when reaching items located higher, due to the fact that objects in the environment are mostly located statically, and it is difficult to get at them as a disabled user. Especially for disabled peo-ple, the functions should come to them instead of the other way around. The results of the study prove that the co-adaptation of assistive mobility devices3 with various residential functions, allow the complexity reduction of mobility robots. Companies notice a huge potential in such an approach, as it would allow them to design less complex, and thus more cost effective robots for ADLs use. The high cost of robots is currently one of the main obstacles for deploying them in the home environment. Based on this study, TUM was finally able to set up a government funded 3-year R&D project (total funding cost: 3.9 Million , starting from June 2012) where major strategies, processes and components necessary to achieve uninterrupted mobility chains for elderly people will be brought to product market level.

We would not be inclined to recognize rights were it not for the conviction that individuals genuinely are owed some measure of sovereignty over their own lives, that a person’s life is deficient unless it is directed by his own will. Self-direction as an essential component of human good is one postulate of an ethic with an individualistic core. It is not the only postulate, however; a person’s path to perdition can be one he consciously and deliberately chooses for himself. Perhaps Socrates is persuasive in arguing that the person who so chooses must lack some element of knowledge concerning the badness of the condition toward which he guides himself, but lack of omniscience is the common human condition, not a myopia that blinds a wretched few. At any rate, there is no reason to think that self-direction is incompatible with ignorance, viciousness, bad luck, or any of the numerous other shortcomings that can debilitate a life. Not all goods come wrapped together in one package.",

      "abstract": "Humans reason and care about ethical issues, such as avoiding unnecessary harm. But what enables us to develop a moral capacity? This question dates back at least to ancient Greece and typically results in the traditional opposition between sentimentalism (the view that morality is mainly driven by socioaffective processes) and rationalism [the view that morality is mainly driven by (socio)cognitive processes or reason]. Here, we used multiple methods (eye-tracking and observations of expressive behaviors) to assess the role of both cognitive and socioaffective processes in infants’ developing morality. We capitalized on the distinction between moral (e.g., harmful) and conventional (e.g., harmless) transgressions to investigate whether 18-mo-old infants understand actions as distinctively moral as opposed to merely disobedient or unexpected. All infants watched the same social scene, but based on prior verbal interactions, an actor’s tearing apart of a picture (an act not intrinsically harmful) with a tool constituted either a conventional (wrong tool), a moral (producing harm), or no violation (correct tool). Infants’ anticipatory looks differentiated between conventional and no violation conditions, suggesting that they processed the verbal interactions and built corresponding expectations. Importantly, infants showed a larger increase in pupil size (physiological arousal), and more expressions indicating empathic concern, in response to a moral than to a conventional violation. Thus, infants differentiated between harmful and harmless transgressions based solely on prior verbal interactions. Together, these convergent findings suggest that human infants’ moral development is fostered by both sociocognitive (inferring harm) and socioaffective processes (empathic concern for others’ welfare).",

I don’t mean that they are generally deviant or that they perform abnormally on conservation or class inclusion tasks. They generally seem more or less normal, and on the few occasions when I have presented tasks from the cognitive developmental literature, they have acted pretty much like the children described in the articles. Where my children are altogether different from the theoretical descriptions is in the variability of their thinking. Cognitive developmental theories generally depict age and thought as proceeding in a 1:1 relation. At an early age, children think in one way; at a later age, they think in another way; at a still later age, they think in a third way. Such descriptions are so pervasive that they begin to feel like reality. Young children are said to form thematic concepts; somewhat older ones to form chain concepts; yet older ones to form true concepts. The reasoning of young children is said to be preoperational; that of somewhat older ones concrete operational; that of yet older ones formal operational. Young children are said to have one theory of mind; somewhat older ones a different, more inclusive theory; yet older ones a more advanced theory still. The story is the same with characterizations of performance on specific tasks. In descriptions of the development of the concept of living things, 3- and 4-yearolds are said to think that anything that moves is alive, 5- to 8-year-olds that animals—and only animals—are alive, and older children that plants as well as animals are alive. In descriptions of the development of addition skill, kindergartners are said to count from one; first through third graders to count from the larger addend; fourth graders and older children to retrieve answers from memory. In descriptions of the development of serial recall strategies, 5-year-olds are said not to rehearse; 8-year-olds to rehearse in a simple way; 11-year-olds to rehearse in a more elaborate way. My children’s thinking has never looked as neat and clean as these 1:1 characterizations of the relation between age and thought.",

There may be people incapable of reaching any reasoned decision about what to do, and acting on it.2 But anyone who asks how she should live implicitly agrees that her goal is to live well, to live a life that she can think worth living. That goal, eudaimonia, is something that is sought for its own sake, and for nothing else. Anyone who asks herself how she should live can answer that she should live well. The answer, admittedly, needs further comment. Aristotle went on to suggest that ‘living well’ amounted to living in accordance with virtue, or if there is more than one virtue, in accordance with the best and most complete. Eudaimonia, happiness, is virtuous activity over a whole life. To live a worthwhile life we must acquire and practice habits of doing the right thing, for the right reason. Equivalently, we must do what a virtuous person would, and in the way she would, for the sake of to kalon, or beauty.",

      "abstract": "in society; for example, the problem of the relation of variation in elements of identification to variation in occupational role behavior, and that of the way in which the identifications of individuals function within the organizations in which they work. Let us consider, as an instance of the latter class of problem, the way in which variations in these elements of identification affect the relative ease of an individual's mobility through occupational institutions, keeping in mind the effect which differences in mobility potential have on the organizations in which these people work. If, in identifying himself occupationally, an individual exhibits an intense identification with a particular institutional position or a particular set of tasks or with both of these, movement to some other position, or movement which involves a shift in the actual job done, becomes more difficult. The physiologists exemplify this tendency. Tied to their particular research problems and techniques, they are unable to envision themselves occupying any but the few positions they know of in which they can pursue these problems in the way they know best. Even the minor move to department chairman worries them. Neither the engineers nor philosophers have any such commitment to task or institutional position, and movement is much more possible for them, should it become an alternative available to them. The engineers, for example, are ready to move into any kind of position in the country's industrial system, while the philosophers are able to consider with equanimity many kinds of positions involving a variety of skills, as long as they allow for continued intellectual activity. The physiologists' limited view allows them to fit easily into the limited mobility pattern of the university when they actually take their positions in it, just as the engineers' high mobility potential allows them to meet with ease the personnel needs of the expanding industrial economy into which they are moving. In this sense, identifications have functional consequences for institutions.",

      "abstract": "DUNS SCOTUS ON THE WILL* (I made them) . . . . . . authors to themselves in all, Both what they judge and what they choose; for so I formed them free, and free they must remain TUl they enthrall themselves. Milton, Paradise Lost, III 122—25 For Duns Scotus, the wiU has no example or analogue in the rest of nature. He takes it to be an elementary, simple self-activity, not derivable from anything else, and distinct from every sort of activity that is not the wiU. Its distinctive characteristic is its complete freedom with respect to action of opposite kinds. Since it is unique, it is not capable of being defined; but anyone can obtain an immediate awareness of the will as free. \"Whoever makes an act of wiU experiences in himself that he can also not wUl.\"1 \"Anyone can experience this in himself: when someone else presents to him something as good and even shows it as a good to be considered and wiUed, he can turn away from it and refuse to elicit any act of wiU towards it.\"8 That such extreme contingency , taken as an example of contingency in general, is underivable from any prior principles can be shown by the following argument: Inference is possible from the less perfect, i. e., the contingent, to the more perfect, i. e., the necessary, but the reverse is not possible. \"Therefore, it cannot be shown by means of some prior and distinct middle term, that being is necessary or contingent, nor could that part of the disjunction that is contingent be demonstrated, given that something is necessary. Thus, the statement 'Something is contingent', appears primarily true and not deductively demonstrable (demonsirdbilis propter quid).\" Scotus concludes at this point with a paraphrase of Avicenna's mUd witticism: \"So, those who deny 'something * A paper read before the Southern Society for Philosophy of Religion, Tallahassee, Florida, 5 March 1953. 1 Q. in Met. IX, q. 15, n. 15. Experitur enim qui vult se posse non velle. 8 Op. Ox. IV, d. 45, q. 10, n. 10. Hoc potest quilibet experiri in se ipso: cum quis offert sibi aliquod bonum, et etiam ostendit bonum ut bonum considerandum et volendum, potest se ab hoc avertere, et nullum actum voluntatis circa hoc elicere. 147 148/. R. CRESSWELL is contingent' ought to be exposed to be tormented, until they admit that it is possible not to be tortured.\"8 \"The wül in the act of willing is an immediate datum ... to demand proof (in this connection) is the mark of an Ul-educated man.\"4 Though the passages on contingency just quoted are concerned with contingent being as such, they obvioulsy provide the basis for his appeal to experience in any attempt to examine the nature of the wUl. Indeed, a chief emphasis in his whole phüosophic exposition is on what is or can be experienced. Let us now proceed to characterize the free will. In the Opus Oxoniense I, dist. 39, article 3, Duns Scotus says that the freedom of our wiU consists of three things: First, the will is free in regard to contrary acts; it can wiU or refrain from wUUng the same objective. Second, the wUl is free in regard to contrary objects; it can tend towards opposite objects. Third, the wiU is free in regard to contrary effects; it can choose among opposite objectives, and to be able to choose thus is to be able to produce opposite effects. Freedom of wül as such is found particularly in the second feature. If this second point is considered, we can see that the wiU can exercise successively two contrary acts. Can it also be true that it has this potentiaUty towards contrary acts simultaneously ? Suppose further that, in this single instant, it exercises a particular voUtion. To aU appearances, its freedom of choice would be exhausted in this single act, so that one could say that the act would fill its whole existence. However, this single voUtion would not be a necessitated one, and here is the proof. If the wül necessarily exercised this voUtion and since it would be a cause only in the single instant...",

      "abstract": "THE reproductive process is one of the most fundamental and imperative activities that operates in Nature.It is not limited to the reflexes involving the special instruments of reproduction, for it affects the whole organism; it depends upon vital protoplasmic bodily states, and includes most of the elementary excitations of which man is capable-the various sensations and sentiments, the pleasure of possession, admiration, self-esteem, love of approbation, reverence, exalted sympathies, and certain physiological wants; all of them enter into this great \" complex,\" which involves the most powerful as well as the most compound of the feelings.This process in certain constitutions depending upon tem- perament, diathesis, and heredity, is apt to be disturbed; which is evidence, if any were needed.that the idea of mind and body being separate and independent is radically false, and that bodily phenomena accompanying states of feeling are not factors external and negligible, foreign to psychology, and without interest to it.When disturbance takes place during the fulfilment or after the immediate completion of this process, it converts (as Clouston states) the most joyous time of life into one of fearful anxiety, and, short of death, no event is so great a shock to all concerned, for the perfection of the providence for childhood is destroyed by disease, and the strongest affec- tion turns to hatred and becomes a danger.Those who have studied the reproductive life of woman admit that gestation is attended with much nervous disturb- ance in many, and some nervous disturbance in all; the inti- mate sympathetic connection of the mammae with the gravid uterus gives rise in normal persons to various forms of neur- algia, severe headaches, dizziness, and insomnia, whereas in highly-susceptible persons these changes of disposition and character become so marked that irritability, fractiousness, and despondency may and do amount to actual insanity; and although this period of life is less liable to insanity than any other, the dynamical changes in the nervous currents are so great that insanity does actually occur about once in every 700 confinements.As against these figures, however, it may be well to quote Ripping, who, whilst acknowledging and admitting that changes in the uterus or its appendagesphysiological or pathological-may have an effect upon the mental susceptibilities of woman, denies that these are ever profound enough to become a cause of insanity.(iENERAL 8TATISTICS.",

      "title": "Bodies, Artworks, and Use Values",
      "abstract": "Bodies, Artworks, and Use Values Terry Eagleton (bio) People Like to Feel Useful but not to feel used, a distinction which captures something of our general ambiguity about the concept of use. Not to feel used may be to feel dumped and discarded, which is objectionable; but it may also be to feel treated as an end in oneself, which is not. Perhaps what counts is the difference between being put to use by others and being the agent of one’s own practical efforts. But this is surely not the case. For one thing, others can make use of you in constructive ways, as when they draw upon your medical skills to save their dying child. This is hardly a case of being exploited. We do, after all, speak of using someone well. “Use” here refers simply to the way we treat people, not necessarily to treating them as a means to an end. And even then, as I have just indicated, this may be entirely acceptable. To use somebody in the pejorative sense of the term is not to bend their powers and capacities to certain ends, but to do this while riding roughshod over their own interests and desires. In this sense, what is wrong with using people is akin to what is wrong with sociological functionalism. It is not that social roles and institutions do not have functions, but that they cannot be reduced to them. Nor can people be reduced to what we want from them. But we are entitled to want things from them even so, which is a matter of using them, but not in a way they can legitimately object to. One can also use oneself in unjust or abusive ways, as when one shoots off a finger from one’s hand once a week simply for the cheap thrill of it. A tougher case is when one freely submits to being the mere tool or chattel of someone else. Someone may find supreme self-fulfilment in dressing up as a Victorian maidservant, calling themselves Milly and scrubbing five flights of stairs a day. If it is hard to see why they should be censured for this, it is equally difficult to regard it as a paradigm of the good life. That a liberal society does not prevent its citizens from using and abusing themselves does not mean that it should approve of it. Using oneself, however, has its limits. I can certainly make use of my own body, as when I lie supine in the mud so that Brad Pitt can descend from his limousine without soiling his shoes. This is to treat my body as an instrument, which is by no means always objectionable. Think of [End Page 561] stretching oneself across a cleft in the rocks so that one’s companions can scramble to safely over one’s spine. Nor is it always objectionable to treat other people’s bodies as instruments. If I am too cowardly or arthritic to stretch myself over the cleft, I might secure your consent to stretch your lithe, courageous young person over it instead. A martyr is one who gives his or her body away for the sake of others. Even so, I cannot use myself as an instrument in the same sense that I can use a fork. This is partly because a body is not exactly something that I have, even if we find ourselves speaking often enough in such terms. My relationship to my body is not fundamentally an instrumental one, even though I can speak of having the use of my legs or eyes. I can objectify my flesh to some extent, and could not function as a subject if I could not, but it is not my possession. To say that this body is mine is just a way of distinguishing between it and other bodies, not a way of saying that it belongs to me, and that I am therefore free to (say) pump it full of heroin. Morally speaking, I am no more free to do this than I am to pump you full of heroin. As far as that goes, there is no significant difference...",

      "abstract": "5 < rHAT sociologists and social anthropologists call the cultural \\/\\/ value or belief system of a society can be lived up to only T v partially, fragmentarily, intermittently and only in an approximate way. The ideals of prophets and saints can take root only when they are attenuated, moderated and compromised with other contradictory ideals and with the demands of the situation and the needs of 'the old Adam'. Ideals and beliefs can only influence conduct alongside of personal ties, primordial attachments, and responsibilities in corporate bodies and they can come into play primarily in the form of vague notions regarding the Right and Good in concrete forms. Sociologists and anthropologists might make it appear as if every man is implicitly a philosopher and a theologian with a coherent image of the cosmos and society and a hierarchy of standards of preference. This is, however, very far from the truth. Man is much more concerned with what is near at hand, with what is present and concrete than with what is remote and abstract. He is more responsive on the whole to persons, to the status of those who surround him and the justice which he sees in his own situation than he is with the symbols of remote persons, with the total status system in the society and with the global system of jusiice. Immediately present authorities engage his mind more than remote ones. The ordinary man is however not a complete idiot in the Greek sense. In a dormant way, semi-conscious and peripheral, he too responds to the central authoriiies and symbols of the society. From time to iime, as occasion reqllires, he comes more closely into contact with them; his consciousness is opened to them at election time, in times of naiional troubles, in great ceremonial occasions like the Coronaiion, in the same way in which an 'Easter asd Christmas' communicant enters into communion with divinity on these",

      "abstract": "Treating the other as an autonomous person is widely considered a guiding ethical principle. The notions of autonomy and personhood are, however, far from evident in a time of striding naturalism. Hermeneutical phenomenology provides an explanation of these notions, and argues that personhood is not merely an ethical principle, but an integral part of vulnerability to mental illness. In other words, ethics and questions of norms and values are not merely a bioethical add-on to psychiatry, but an integral part of what it means to do psychiatry. Being a person is to be faced with the constant task of becoming who I am through the otherness that constitutes my life as a person. Otherness challenges my life from without (e.g., the way other people understand and treat me) and from within (e.g., my body, habits, and dispositions). Although a major aspect of personal identity is constituted by otherness, a person is able, nevertheless, to change her habits, think about her dispositions, and reconsider her actions. This ability to relate ourselves to what and who we are is constitutive of personhood and of the fragility that makes each of us the person that we are.",

It is also concluded that when anyone fills his needs, the foremost effects of those needs are called active characteristics, but after quenching those needs, the final or end effects/ results are called proactive characteristics of those needs. So there is an urgent need to explore the characteristics of human needs which are the complete reflection of active & proactive characteristics of human behavior, attitude, aptitude and habits etc. These traits also have their own active & proactive characteristics which cannot be measured or calculated so easily. It also seems impossible to make the lists of these characteristics of needs because Love and Belongingness Needs are the sum of hundreds and thousands of elements which have billions of characteristics and effectiveness. Their characteristics are so interrelated and interconnected, that they cannot be segregated from each other. This article will reveal the purity, entity, eternity, morality, stability, reliability, novelty, richness, freshness, aliveness, uniqueness, fairness and worth of the characteristics of the human needs. This will also clear that there should be equity, equality, accuracy, accountability and justice to fill the Love and Belongingness Needs.",

Our remembered emotions (memories) are usually rosier than our experienced emotions, and people are motivated by their predicted emotions, which tend to coincide with their emotional memories. This Article advocates that law should care more about experiencing selves than remembering selves if and when experiences result in chronic health or stress consequences that either (1) societies care about more than people do (because of externalities, public bads, or public goods) or (2) people also care about, but are unaware of, do not remember, or are unable to act upon (due to self-control problems). This Article analyzes examples of chronic health or stress effects from such experiences as dense and long commutes, unhealthy eating, lack of regular physical exercise, sedentary behavior, and financial/retirement planning.",

My aim is to show how a particular command could relate to these pre-existing moral considerations, if it is more than just a repetition of them. If it is right that an action be obligatory, wrong or supererogatory, why would God want to change its status? Anyone can make a normative difference by giving information, making co-ordination proposals, or transferring rights, and it is clear why these actions will sometimes by worthwhile. The problem must be focused on when God makes a moral difference directly, using a ‘special moral authority’, when His commands are efficacious qua commands. Using this authority, God can perfect imperfect duties, which may make it easier to carry them out. He can extend duties, to make sure more value is produced. He can allocate sacrifices, which can be carried by anyone. And He can resolve conflict games, to everyone's benefit. This explains why God should issue commands in the way that theists typically represent him as doing.",

These three categories were united in the Babylonian mind around the concept of the <i>māmīt</i> 'oath' idea, the behaviour habits being so unbreakable it appeared that the subject had sworn an oath to do or not to do the action involved. The behavioural accounts were entirely objective, including what we would call immature, antisocial and criminal behaviour, and obsessional categories of contamination, aggression, orderliness of objects, sex and religion. They do not include subjective descriptions of obsessional thoughts, ruminations or the subject9s attitude to their own behaviour, which are more modern fields of enquiry. <h3>Conclusions</h3> The Babylonians had no understanding of brain or psychological function but they were remarkable describers of medical disease and behaviour. Although they had both physical and supernatural theories of many medical disorders and behaviours, they had an open mind on these particular behaviours which they regarded as a 'mystery' yet to be 'resolved'. We are not aware of comparable accounts of these behaviours in ancient Egyptian or classical medicine. These Babylonian descriptions extend the history of these disorders to the first half of the second millennium BC.",

It took more than wealth to be a vir bonus; he also had to embody a number of other characteristics, including integrity and gravitas, and adhere to a particular dignified lifestyle. These demands meant that some men of substance did not count as proper boni in its full sense of ‘good’ and might find their status challenged. A passage in Cicero’s Pro Flacco sums up who qualified as a vir bonus and who did not. He contrasts ‘viros bonos gravisque homines’ with a ‘homini egenti, sordido, sine honore, sine existumatione, sine censu’, Flac. 52. His second, negative definition of bonus is revealing and shows that a combination of qualities was required. Wealth was the obvious precondition (census), but he also had to be satisfied with his resources (i.e. not being egens). In addition, he had to be a man of honour (honos) and enjoy general esteem and a good reputation (existumatio).",

Simple observation alone is a failure to perceive feelings; without reaction, positive or negative, one's feeling for a piece have yet to be touched and perception is soon lost. In my work, I strive to achieve feelings. I release my own, attempting to use visual signs to convey ideas and emotional experiences. Although I enjoy the procedures involved in the production of the piece and even if I am satisfied with the piece, I hesitate to accept the results unless others react. Without a reaction, I question whether I have conveyed my feelings or developed any for the observer, and the possibilities of further involvement are retarded.

[I]t is more important . . . for [these professionals] to maintain an overview of the behavior of the whole system than to have detailed knowledge about its components. . . . [They] tend to be very wary of [the pressure to intervene], primarily because it runs counter to a basic attitude of conservatism fostered by their culture: “when in doubt, don’t touch anything.” Their reluctance to take any action unless it is clearly necessary arises from the awareness that any operation represents a potential error, with potentially severe consequences. (Von Meier 1999, pp. 104-107) . . . We suspect that many readers would see ecologists (writ large again) as the professional group whose views are being described. Ecologists, as we have seen, frequently describe the ecosystem in just such terms: it responds to external disturbances, the whole system is more than the sum of its parts, it displays nondeterministic behavior, its complexity can never be fully captured and, therefore, management is extremely challenging, with managers always reluctant to intervene—at least in major ways—in ecosystems they do not know, because this potentially creates more problems than it solves. However, ecologists are not the group being described, and here is the surprise.

It does so in dialogue with pragmatist theories of action and the theories of Orlando Patterson, Rene Girard, James Coleman, Judith Butler, and G.W.F. Hegel. In hierarchical relations, a figure is elevated to a superior position with enhanced capacity, and to such a figure discretion accrues. This is the person or group who rules, and rule enables the accomplishment of projects. Such mastery—which accrues to rectors—is dependent upon allies and subordinates (actors, who become agents) to whom tasks are delegated and from whom knowledge and expertise are gained, advice is taken, profits are stolen, and value is extracted. Power is dependent on its dependents, and an agent both stands in for, and works on behalf of, the rector. Actor becomes an agent by abdicating, in part, actor's own projects. If actor is an ally to rector, other stands outside the project, profaned. The radical uncertainty that other represents to rector and actor can become an synecdoche for the uncertainty of the world itself. There are four types of extreme alterity: enemy in war, slavery, invisibility, and scapegoat.",

      "abstract": "To suspend: “To debar temporarily, especially from a privilege.” “To hold in an undetermined or undecided state awaiting further information.” “To keep from falling or sinking by some invisible support as buoyancy.” “To keep fixed or lost (as in wonder or contemplation).” In Bodily Natures: Science, Environment, and the Material Self, I argue for a conception of trans-corporeality that traces the material interchanges across human bodies, animal bodies, and the wider material world. As the material self cannot be disentangled from networks that are simultaneously economic, political, cultural, scientific, and substantial, what was once the ostensibly bounded human subject finds herself in a swirling landscape of uncertainty where practices and actions that were once not even remotely ethical or political matters suddenly become so. Trans-corporeality is a new materialist and posthumanist sense of the human as substantially and perpetually interconnected with the flows of substances and the agencies of environments. Activists, as well as everyday practitioners of environmental, environmental health, environmental justice, and climate change movements, work to reveal and reshape the flows of material agencies across regions, environments, animal bodies, and human bodies—even as global capitalism and the medical–industrial complex reassert a more convenient ideology of solidly bounded, individual consumers and benign, discrete products. Even though the recognition of trans-corporeality begins with human bodies in their environments, tracing substantial interchanges renders the human permeable, dissolving stable outlines. Tracing these connections discourages us from taking refuge in the fantasies of transcendence and imperviousness that make environmentalism a merely elective and external enterprise.",

      "abstract": "Bowlby saw attachment as one of several motivational and behavioral systems in humans and mentioned affiliation and playful interactions as examples of related systems that were distinct from seeking protection from an attachment figure. In his first volume on attachment, he quotes Murray (1938) who introduced the use of the word \"affiliation\" to denote \"all manifestations of friendliness and good will, and a desire to do things in the company of others \" (Bowlby, 1969/1982, p. 229). Bowlby goes on to say that \"as such [affiliation] is a much broader concept than attachment and is not intended to cover behaviour that is directed at one or two particular figures, which is the hallmark of attachment behaviour\" (p. 229). Bowlby also made the distinction between playful interactions and attachment:A child seeks his attachment figure when he is tired, hungry, ill, or alarmed and also when he is uncertain of the figure's whereabouts . . . By contrast, a child seeks a playmate when he is in good spirits and confident about the whereabouts of his attachment-figure; when the playmate is found, moreover, the child wants to engage in playful interactions with him or her. If this analysis is right, the roles of the attachment figure and playmate are distinct.",

Their very survival depends on the love and affection that are already embedded in the hearts of mothers. No amount of selfish attitude of mothers, not at least from short life span, can help in the growth of their off‐springs. One can argue that it is the self‐interested motive of the parents and most particularly the mothers of getting supports in their old days that drives them to be altruistic rather than selfish. Being altruistic means undertaking a lot of sacrifice in terms of personal pleasure and happiness merely for seeing pleasure and happiness in others regardless of any human bondage. An egoistic person, on the other hand, would never care for others. Personal level satisfaction only dominates the mind of an extremely egoistic or self‐centered man.",

If the individual would not interest himself \"aggressively\" for the human beings surrounding himself, if he would not be \"hungry\" for human contact he would not associate himself for pairing and groups. He would not look for individuals who are of the same mind. This existential hunger, which is laid down in his nervous system seeking for stimuli, contains always an \"aggressive\" interest and leads man also towards searching scientifically his own psychosomatic conditions and the whole world. But this hunger can lead in certain men and under favouring conditions in whole groups and peoples to dimensions which endanger individuality and the human pride. This aggression then does not any longer serve communication but further incorporation and power. It is the beginning of the way leading to destruction of human values and human life. The responsibilities of our society should keep in mind that the human readiness for aggression does not drive further in the direction of violence and should rather be developed in the sense originally inherent to her: of an interest in the surrounding human beings and in nature.",

As a result of this, different clothing styles can evoke different connotations based on the viewers assumption of the ideals of the groups or contexts that the wearer’s clothing connects them to, such as formal office dress and LGBTQ+ fashions, whether by choice or by pressure. Also, through dress individuals can internalize these ideals of the group, to influence their view of themselves, and in turn how they interact with the outside world. Furthermore, clothing can also highlight a person’s individuality through failure to conform, evoking a different individual-world interaction. Regardless, an individual’s desire to express themselves and externalize the internal can lead to clothing construction or altering to better represent themselves, and/or their relationship to a group.",

Like the dream, a mood has a kind of necessary autistic structure to it: people who are in a mood, like persons who are asleep, are inside a special state where a temporal element is at play. They will emerge, like the dreamer, after the spell is over. Some moods, particularly those that are a part of a person's character, are occasions for the expression of a conservative object, as a conservative object is that internal self state that has been preserved intact during childhood often upon some breakdown between the child in relation to his parents. When a person goes 'into' a mood he becomes that child self who was refused expression in relation to his parents for one reason or another. As such, moods are often the existential registers of the moment of a breakdown between a child and his parents, and partly notate the parent's own developmental arrest, in that the parent was unable to deal appropriately with the child's particular maturational needs. What was a self experience in the child, one that could have been integrated into the child's continuing self development, was rejected by the parents, who failed to perform adequately as ordinary 'transformational objects', thereby destining a self state to be frozen by the child into a conservative object that fated such a state of being to be subsequently represented only through moods.",

As human beings operating in a world of limited goods, they are so physically and intellectually feeble that neither of them is able to permanently enslave the other and submit him to the second person’s will. Such being the case, each solution to the problem means that the profit of one person is the loss of the second. The question, whether justice is possible at all, suggests itself whether in a situation when people are more or less equal, or with limited altruism and/or selfishness and scarce resources.",

      "title": "The Ethical Dimension of Human Nature: A New Realist Theory",
      "abstract": "[Abstract]: Interactions amongst individuals and in larger organisations are intimately bound to the\nreality of the human being. From the simple fact that all sentient beings feel pleasure and\npain, it follows that they must take action to avoid harm or promote benefit, in ways that\nsuit their total reality. However, humans have a uniquely flexible mind and a language\ncapable of communicating subtle or abstract thoughts. As a consequence, humans can ask\nquestions on these matters with a depth that is revolutionary in terms of existence on this\nplanet. This revolutionary new capacity must not be squandered by denying the objective\nand universal nature of the ethical discussion undertaken by individuals, groups and\nsocieties. Human goods are frequently intangible, but this should not mislead us into\nthinking that they are less real than material goods.\nIn this analysis, ethics is the realm that connects individual human nature to societal realities\nsuch as laws. It does so in various conceptual dimensions. In the domain of willed action it\nrecognises that human beings are neither infallible nor omniscient, and therefore cannot give\neffect to all their plans; so there must be a realm of unenforced obligation between what is\ncompulsory (law) and what is completely free (personal preferences). In the realm of\nplanning and understanding, ethics is the connective between the realities of individual\nhuman nature and those of social organisation. These are processes of mutual influence and\nfeedback determined by reality, whether we understand that reality or not. Weaknesses in\nethical theories can lead to laws and standards that cause great harm. For example,\nAristotle's ethic contained no means of warning him of the evil of slavery - in this\nconnection we examine one modern redevelopment of Aristotle. However, if there are\nethical truths, grounded in reality, then unanticipated possibilities are opened for positively\ninfluencing human social and individual evolution.\nThe Principle of Goodness is a new realist ethical theory which acknowledges truths about human nature and the vast web of interactions within which humans live and exercise their wills. Despite its simplicity, it has much to say about how people should act ethically, with\ninfluences both by and upon individuals. The trust and security that follows from treating\nevery single one ethically as an individual will be conducive to the development of positive\nfeedback cycles of care, concern, friendship, and compassion throughout the matrix of\nhuman interaction. The challenge, then, for those who desire a world free of inequity,\nconflict and insecurity is to re-examine every social field informed by this ethics, which is\ngrounded in the inescapable reality of the human condition.",

The functions are physical, cognitive and social, without progressive chronic diseases and without disabilities. There is a change in the concept of successful aging beyond the physical dimension (daily function (ADL) and cognitive function) which is based on objective performance indicators towards subjective indicators based on the patients' feelings and their quality of life. Successful aging moves from the limited bio-physical aspect to an overall view of bio-psycho-socio which means mental-emotional-behavioral aspects, social involvement, and also an element of spirituality and even end-of-life decisions. Successful aging will be measured by objective and subjective measures that include the patient's feelings and experiences. The idea is to include and see in successful aging not only the absence of morbidity and disability as seen by Rowe and Kahan, but to a multidimensional function that includes physical and cognitive, mental and emotional, social and spiritual parameters and a dimension of the end of life in making decisions according to the wishes and preferences of the person himself and his family.",

How well things go for someone depends on whether, and to what extent, the things that happen in her life are good or bad for her. A theory of well‐being purports to tell us how to identify the things in a person's life that are basically good or bad for her – good or bad for her in their own right, and not merely on account of causing things that are good or bad for her (as money does), indicating such things (as the results of a blood test might), having such things as parts (as the person's entire life might), or being otherwise related to such things. Roughly speaking, an objective theory of well‐being is one that claims that something can be basically good for a person even if she has no favorable (or “pro‐”) attitude toward it or basically bad for her even if she has no disfavorable (or “con‐”) attitude toward it. Examples of objective theories include theories on which knowledge, moral virtue, or the exercise of distinctively human capacities is a basic good.",

      "abstract": "Teaching respect: a philosophical analysis According to a Zulu proverb a human being can only become truly human because of others. Each person can only become more human, more him self- regardless of his sex - through the co-involvement of others. It is the love for one’s neighbour and the respect one has for him/her as a person which makes one consider the other party's feelings, viewpoints and circumstances. In order to arrive at a situation of peaceful coexistence it is important to realize that human attitudes and a mature life style evolve through a process of learning and interaction with others. It is a time­ consuming and costly process which starts at infancy and continues throughout someone's life. Instruction concerning interpersonal relations and the teaching of respect cannot be confined to individual lessons or working sessions at home or in school. Discussions and conversations concerning interpersonal relations need to form an integral and natural part of a child’s life within the home environment and throughout the pupil's school career. It is senseless if educators talk about the importance of teaching respect only to reveal disrespectful behaviour themselves, or to talk about the importance of self-esteem in the paying of respect whilst causing children to feel negative about themselves. To be able to express respect to other human beings, one needs to be respected. A child needs to experience how it feels when homage is paid. The following rule of life applies in this regard: one can never give if one has never received respect.",

The topic of gesture includes bodily movements that occur in close association with speech (gesticulation); expressive movements that can be used independently of speech and can serve as complete utterances on their own, such as the thumb up gesture, the shoulder-shrug, or shaking of the fist (autonomous gesture); gestural codes used in certain occupational circumstances in which speech is difficult or impossible, primary sign languages used in communities of the deaf, alternate sign languages used in some tribal and religious communities during periods when speech is forbidden, and the special elaboration of gesture found in religious RITUAL, as in the complex systems of mudras developed as part of the ritual of prayer in Tantric Buddhism; and the complex gestural systems found in some DANCE traditions, especially in India.",

      "abstract": "A necessary condition for the existence of conscious ability in the way of correlative correlation between the planes of mental acts (noesis) and content-meanings (noema) – is an activity. Despite the communicative content of other activities, there is actually a communicative activity – communication, the leading motive of which is communication itself. Psychological and physical contact with the object of such communication is a self-sufficient goal for the subject. The emotional-dispositional basis of his motivation is all kinds of love and amicability. Deprivation of communication causes serious damage to the mental health of almost all people. Therefore, communication is a basic condition and a way of normal functioning of human conscious ability, the main factor of mental development of speech as a basis for this ability of infants and young children, who desperately need communication, full of expressive manifestations of love and tenderness. Children, who suffer from the deprivation of such communication, noticeably lag behind in development: their own speech and understanding of what is addressed to them, intelligence, self-awareness, adequate emotionality, social activity and adaptability. Mechanisms of social-psychological interaction are gradually “connected” to the process of intuitive “interiorization” of infants and young children, the essence of which is that in the noems of the subject’s conscious ability, the attitude to him, to other people, to the world of authoritative and referent for him individuals and groups is reflected. The most powerful subjective factor of the effectiveness of a child’s personal development is authentic activity through the volitional effort required to follow the rules of the game that attracts and captures it. Children benevolently accept the restrictions required by the rules of the game and are happy to follow them, because these are the conditions for testing their mental and somatic life potential, because in the process of the game «play» the vital forces of the child that please her. Such pleasure is the emotional-motivational basis of any real game and the deep foundation of the psychological affinity of game self-limitation and self-overcoming with the morality and spirituality of a personality, and thus a subjective factor in the development of his spiritual-moral conscious ability. At the same time, its aesthetic sensitivity develops due to the fact that the rules of the game form the harmonious system that gives the aesthetic impression of the beauty of the game. The deep basis of motivation of artistic-figurative activity (creation and perception of works of art) is a secret human desire – freedom of spirit, liberation from the shackles of its biological and social “handcuff”. Therefore, the ideological-emotional core of the images of high art is the freedom-loving human spirit, which is subject to the urges caused by the biological nature of human and social taboos and imperatives that oppress him. In the process of artistic-figurative activity, the subject empathically identifies with the struggles of the spirit of the art works’ heroes. These empathic shifts of one’s own spiritual-moral ability delight the subject, who develops the emotional-dispositional foundations of corresponding noems of his conscious ability. Cognition requires a serious attitude and hard work, which is most motivated by interest in its content. An effective way of such interest is the game psychological content of teaching. In general, the question of including the game into cognitive activity makes sense only as a fulfillment of the learning process with game psychological content. To organically combine the hard efforts of students, which requires knowledge and assimilation of scientific truths and spiritual values with game attractiveness - is not easy, but possible, especially concerning subjects of artistic-aesthetic cycle due to the semantic affinity of motivation of game and artistic-figurative activities. A necessary condition for the humanistic mission of sport is that it must be a noble competition, that is, a real game.",

      "abstract": "Ordinary individuals in international relations not only embody violence, suffering, and indifference; they also seem totally subordinated to the impotence produced by the burden of responsibility for the fate of all vulnerable human beings across the world. These ordinary individuals also engage in benevolent actions. They adopt practices aimed at the good of others and even of nature, but in proximity. It is indeed at this local scale that benevolence finds its primary and probably most intense dynamic. As Hutcheson pointed out, benevolence, like gravitation, is stronger the closer bodies get ‘and come to touch’. But this scale is by no means disconnected from the rest of international relations, since it remains linked to issues that cross borders, such as environmental protection, the preservation of solidarity links, or, of course, migrations. Such behaviours echo the ‘supererogatory morality’ evoked by Rawls in his Theory of Justice. Fuelled by ‘an acute sensitivity to the feelings and desires of others’, it goes beyond the requirements of justice and ‘is not suitable for ordinary beings’. However, certain moral conducts testify to a movement beyond the ordinary. They tend towards the centre of the benevolence continuum and activate its positive component (to help and improve the conditions of the vulnerable as well as of fellow human beings).",

      "abstract": "To say that human development in history and politics is a complex amalgam of conscious purposes and non-conscious processes, of intended and unintended consequences, of reason and passion, is no doubt true, though not profoundly instructive. Similarly, it may well be true that acts that appear consciously willed are frequently habitual or instinctive, the automatic response to external stimuli or pressures, or the expression of a momentary sensation or feeling and as such comparable to, if not indistinguishable from, modes of causation operative in the non-human world; for they closely resemble the character of unmediated natural processes. But to grant this does not dispose of the question whether forms of human behavior that clearly do involve the mediation of ideas, interests, beliefs, or values are rendered intelligible in terms that are properly located in explanations of unmediated processes. The question presupposes, of course, that mediated sequences are by no means untypical of human actions, and that we think of them as purposive whenever particular ends are consciously chosen and actively pursued. How appropriate, then, is growth, a term borrowed from a non-normative universe of discourse such as biology, as an explanatory or evaluative category in our understanding of occurrences whose distinctive significance for the most part derives from their conceptual and normative content? In order to explore this question, I shall be concerned with three principal distinctions: (i) The distinction between causality and continuity in nature and causality and continuity in history and human affairs generally which, if it is blurred, is liable (I shall suggest) to confuse action with process, function with purpose, and fact with value. (ii) The distinction between purposive continuity in history and purposive continuity of history, and the problem of mediation which the fusion of freedom and necessity attempts to resolve. (iii) The distinction between continuity and change in the sequence of human events, and the problem posed by the notion of development as",

      "title": "Kant: Let Us Compare",
      "abstract": "Every thing in this world is judg'd of by comparison. (1) It is impossible to continue in the practice of contemplating any order of beauty, without being frequently obliged to form comparisons between the several species and degrees of excellence, and estimating their proportion to each other. A man, who has had no opportunity of comparing the different kinds of beauty, is indeed totally unqualified to pronounce an opinion with regard to any object presented to him. By comparison alone we fix the epithets of praise or blame, and learn how to assign the due degrees of each. (2) IN KANT'S ETHICAL THOUGHT, (3) Allen W. Wood powerfully argues in defense of Kant's alleged notion that we ought not to compare ourselves with others on the moral scale, however much such comparison may be meaningful and permissible with respect to our other skills and characteristics, such as the artistic, practical, or technological. Meaningful, permissible, comparable or not, those skills and characteristics have no inherent worth anyway. These have a market price or a fancy price but no dignity, and it is only dignity which confers incomparable moral worth. A human being, says Kant, possesses a dignity (an absolute inner worth) by which he exacts respect for himself from all other rational beings in the world. He can measure himself with every other being of this kind and value himself on a footing of equality with (4) I tend to think, in an a priori way, that to claim that Mother Teresa or Martin Luther King or Mahatma Gandhi and I have the same absolute, incomparable moral worth is just laughable. They might think that I have the same absolute, incomparable moral worth as they do; I concede. I cannot even bring myself to think it. This is not undue self-abnegation or humility. There is moral inequality here; if that is not a hard moral fact, I don't know what is. (5) My purposes in this paper are twofold, one primary, one secondary. The secondary purpose is to argue against Wood's claim that, according to Kant, we ought not to make moral comparisons; it is a rather limited purpose, if only because it concedes to Wood a variety of substantial points in the Kantian exegesis, particularly Wood's idea--which is the cornerstone of his book--that the various formulations of the categorical imperative had better be seen as constituting a system, (6) a system in which the Formula of Humanity as End in Itself plays a central role, a role routinely accorded (since Hegel) to the Formula of the Universal Law. (7) My own reservations about Wood's central thesis lie in the fact that several key passages from the Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals and Critique of Practical Reason, in which Kant explicitly accords the Formula of Universal Law a prime place in his system and denies such a place to any other formula, are not given a fair hearing and sometimes not even aired. This is no less true of the later work, The Metaphysics of Morals, which is Wood's favored piece to show the importance of the Formula of Humanity as an End in Itself. Had he done so, this might perhaps have resulted in the dull view that Kant was ambivalent--perhaps, even conflicted; but making things neater and more clean-cut than is warranted by the texts does not yield accuracy of interpretation. Of course, this is just a bland assertion and must await justification in a paper different from the present one. Whatever the merits of the secondary, exegetical purpose, my primary purpose is philosophical. It is to demonstrate that we ought to make moral comparisons. No one can read Wood's book without marveling at how successful he has been in portraying the unity--not to mention depicting the beauty of that unity--of Kant's moral and social philosophy; nothing said herein detracts from that remarkable achievement. In section 1, I briefly present Wood's central arguments; in section 2, I evaluate them. …",

      "abstract": "The received view holds that to judge something or someone as sentimental is to condemn. This account holds that an emotion is sentimental where it is excessive, misjudges its object and involves savouring a positive self-image. This paper presents two different challenges to the received view. First, the positive idealizations of sentimentality are no worse than other cognitive biases pervasive in our ordinary mental life. Moreover, where, as is often the case, sentimentality is good for our well-being, sentimentality looks broadly rational. Second, and more radically, sentimentality is not always to be evaluated in epistemic terms. Rather, sentimentality, often at least, is a matter of reminding us of or re-orientating our non-cognitive affective attachments. Sentimental works can renew or revolutionize our affective attachments for the good, whether that be towards love, family, causes, or the oppressed. Hence, in both art and life, sentimentality is sometimes a very good thing.",

      "title": "The Physician as a Leader",
      "abstract": "Psychologists divide mortals into two general classifications; one is called the subjective type, the other the objective. The subjective type of personality glories in working on his own responsibility and does his best work by himself with subordinate help, if any. He wishes to know more and more about some particular phase of human activity and to become the expert in medicine, in engineering, or in the arts—he engages in research work—he dreams—he creates—he invents—by and large, he does the world's work. The objective type is exo-centric. He is the power and personality boy. He knows a little about a great many things and not too much about any one thing. He becomes the executive, the politician, or the statesman. He sells the work of the hands of the subjective type. In the main, the world is run by the objective type. Some of us, of course, are altogether subjective or objective, while the majority of us have some of both characteristics but lean more strongly one way or the other. It now becomes apparent why physicians are not particularly successful in presenting their work, their cause, and their point of view; why they are not good politicians and why so frequently they squirm and wiggle because some layman is the executive who tries to direct and control their work and tell them how and where the work of their hands and brains should be carried out. The old-time family physician, the doctor, was a generation ago the father confessor and adviser to persons, not only in matters of health but in economics and human relations of all kinds. He helped John secure finances for the purchase of a bam or more cattle; he gave Mary useful advice in matters of the heart. He must have been objective- as well as subjective-minded since, in many, many ways, he was a power and influence in the community. As medicine has become more and more intricate, as the field of technical knowledge has expanded, too many of us have ceased to be “a doctor“—one who is learned—and have lost our interest for knowledge in fields other than those that concern our daily work; and so we have become highly trained technicians. Is it any wonder that we have gradually, as subjective-minded persons, come under the control of the objective-minded members of the community? It is high time that we make a conscious effort to become partially objective-minded; that we seek positions in our community on Boards of Health or Education; that we run for the City Council, and that we once again exert our personality and intelligence and win back the esteem and the respect of the community because of our efforts for community welfare in general. We should once again produce our rightful proportion of leadership in all phases of human activity.",

All power of fancy over reason is a degree of insanity; but while this power is such as we can controul and repress, it is not visible to others, nor considered as any depravation of the mental faculties: it is not pronounced madness but when it comes ungovernable, and apparently influences speech or action.*",

One of the phenomenon that has concretized this belief, is the ability of certain people, regardless of sex or age to manifest powers beyond the ability of the five senses. In most primitive societies, these people have always been regarded as special. They are readily used in their communities as mediums between this physical world and the spirit world. However, not all of such power holders were considered beneficial as a result of carrying out unwholesome activities that were considered evil for example, witches. These, were many times, feared and ostracised. In modern times, these power holders have lost the glitz and attention they enjoyed in the African traditional religion. They have practically gone under. Without the direct scrutiny of the society which would include the Government, religious bodies, or the police, they are now left to themselves to choose whatever they wanted to do with their powers. In this work, we are able to follow the activities of these power holders as they decide whether to use these powers, to benefit their world, or cause more chaos. We then come to the startling conclusion that it is not the supernatural power or any other kind of power itself that has potential evil but the power holders themselves who driven by power, survival, fear or love can use such uncanny powers for good or evil.",

      "abstract": "Research into historic gardens has often emphasized the garden – the work of art – or else its creator or owner and his interests. Insofar as he has been mentioned, the gardener has often been viewed as an instrumental person giving effect to other people’s intentions. A garden, however, is an ongoing process and its form and content are created and re-created through the actions and decisions of various agents. The gardener’s knowledge, contacts and managerial acumen have a supremely palpable impact on the outcome. Despite the pivotal role of himself and his work in gardens throughout history, the gardener’s almost complete absence in research is notable. Knowledge born of experience, the work of hand and body, has somehow been taken for granted. This study is based on sources of many different kinds, such as gardening accounts, contracts of service, inventories, wage bills, estate inventories, correspondence, citizenship rolls, gardening manuals, horticultural journals and travelogues. In the absence of complete cradle-to-grave data for one individual, it has not been possible to make an individual case study of a particular gardener. Instead particulars of travel, workplaces, forms of tenure, tasks, name changes, godparents, succession, chattels etc. have been obtained from different documents about different gardeners in different places. The main emphasis of the study is on southern Sweden, without focusing on any particular geographic region. The thesis shows that a skilled master gardener, with his experiential knowledge, or ‘tacit knowledge’, was essential to the formal and substantial functioning of the garden during the 18th century. His role was that of caring for the garden and moving it forward, preserving and developing a concept, giving it a raison d’etre and transforming it completely when called upon to do so. In addition, a gardener had to organize the work in the garden, teach garden boys and journeymen, run a business and keep the accounts, present the garden to visitors and sometimes develop new horticultural techniques. The study indirectly provides knowledge concerning the nature of garden design and the manner of its creation.",

      "title": "The rotten apple in the barrel has a bug in it: how the analogy of parasitic infection may shed light on the causes of & solutions to recent financial scandals",
      "abstract": "Time and time again, corporate scandals (lately in the banking sector) remind us of the frailty of human standards and values: ethical conduct is unreliable. The authors have personal experience, drawn from consultancy and research, of the troubling ease with which groups of employees can subvert and expose to existential risk otherwise sound organisations. Daily, occasional and actions under stress may each and all demonstrate forms of behaviour at substantial odds from what individuals would tolerate, enable or support. These individuals are not necessarily behaving irrationally, nor motivated solely by personal gain: and yet their actions are greedy. They put at risk the stability of the overall organisation for the promise of an easier (but unregulated, unsafe or unpalatable) workload, reward or task list.\r\nIn this sense, then, a biological analogy would be of a parasitical infection that drains energy from a host, reducing its ability to remain healthy or, as some real-world parasites do, changing the behaviour of the host such that it is persuaded that unconventional actions are natural, intuitive. The very conditions of work may have a profound influence here: “This dysfunctional perspective is reinforced by contemporary corporate monoculture where employees live in a bubble, log obscene hours, and vacation with their co-workers. As a consequence giant corporations are dogmatically insular with their own warped code of ethics and worldview” (Burnett 2011).\r\nThis paper will seek to shed light on the mechanisms by which teams in organisations come to undertake behaviours which out at risk the sustainability and security of the whole. Here, then, for example, the socially-responsible aspirations and benchmarks of financial institutions are compromised. Supposed to build long-term shareholder value by taking into strategic account the need for engagement and transparency about the company, how it creates value for its stakeholders, how it manages risk and contributes to society – all of these can be undermined by rogue traders (Cf. Nick Leeson, Enron, Parmalat ,NorthernRock, Madoff, LIBOR, the London Whale, RBS, Co-op, RBS GRG). As an American author helpfully puts it: “parasitic accountants […] have subverted America's entrepreneurial spirit and jeopardized the common good” (Burnett 2011).",

      "abstract": "Physical inactivity and a passive lifestyle induce a plethora of negative effects on human physical and mental health. Physical activity is a fundamental human necessity as it enables the preservation of a healthy organism and its organ systems. Recreation entails every form of body movement that increases energy consumption while the body is in the state of inaction. It encompasses fitness, training, and competition, house chores, and other activities that require bodily exertion. Regular implementation of physical activity can benefit overall health and lower the probability of chronic illnesses. However, the lack of recreation presents a globally spread problem. Physical inactivity is a state of insufficient activity, whether it is inadequate with its intensity, length, and/or frequency; its insufficiency disables normal performance of different organs, metabolic regulation processes, construction, and maintenance of non-fat body mass, and preservation of motor abilities. The quality of life is mostly defined as an overall estimation or a personal perspective of an individual with regard to the entire welfare and pleasures of life. The usual understanding of lifestyle quality based on health factors is established on the definition of the WHO; the quality of life is therefore construed as the state of complete physical, mental and social welfare, not just the absence of illness and inability. The aim of this study was to determine the level of activity and quality of life of the working population.",

Humanitarian giftedness involves sharing one’s gifts with others in a way that makes the world a better place. It is not something people are born with—they develop it in the same way other forms of expertise are developed—through a deployment of abilities as developed by deliberate practice and a focus on giving rather than just receiving. Teachers and parents can develop humanitarian giftedness by being role models, by sharing stories of humanitarian giftedness, and by encouraging it in their students. They also must discourage use of gifts for ends that harm humanity. The road to more humanitarian deployment of gifts is not through tests and other assessments, but through the development of humanitarian gifts as a learned form of expertise—as gifts not from genes, but rather from the interaction of the person with the tasks they confront and the environmental contexts in which they live.",

      "title": "Work and Wealth: A Human Valuation.",
      "abstract": "thropist, every public-spirited citizen, does possess and apply to the conduct of affairs some such standard or criterion as we are seeking.Some notion or idea, more or less clear and explicit, of the general welfare, crossed and blurred no doubt by other in- terests and passions, is an operative and directive influence in his policy.Moreover, though idiosyncrasies will everywhere affect this operative ideal, there will be found among persons of widely different minds and dispositions a substantial body of agreement in their meaning of human welfare.The common social environ- ment partly evokes, partly imposes, this agreement.In fact, all cooperative work for social progress implies the existence of some such standard as we are seeking.The complex image of human values which it contains is always slowly changing, and varies somewhat among different sorts and conditions of men.But for the interpretation of economic goods and processes it has, at any time, a real validity.For it is anchored to certain solid founda- tions of human nature, the needs and functions to which, alike in the individual and in the society, we give the term 'organic.'Only by considering the organic nature of man and of human society can we trace an intelligible order in the evolution of industry.The wants of man, and therefore the economic opera- tions serving them must be treated as organic processes.This term, borrowed from biology, must be extended so as to cover the entire physical and spiritual structure of human society, for no other term is so well fitted to describe the nature of the federal unity which society presents.The standard of values thus set up is the current estimate of 'organic welfare.'The justification of these terms and of this mode of human valuation is to be found in their application to the task before us.These tools will be found to do the work better than any others that are available.In seeking to translate economic values into human by refer- ence to such a standard of organic welfare, I take as the aptest material for experiment the aggregate of goods and services that constitute the real income of the British nation.In order to re- duce that income to terms of human welfare, I first examine separately the economic costs of production and the economic utilities of consumption which meet in this concrete wealth, PREFACE vii analysing them into human cost and human utility, the debit and credit sides of the account of welfare.Analysis of the pro- ductive processes will, of course, disclose the fact that not all 'economic' costs have human costs attached to them, but that human utilities of varying value inhere in many sorts of productive work.Surveying the different orders of productive energy, from the finest arts to the lowest modes of routine toil, we discover that any two bodies of economic wealth, possessing the same pecuniary value, may differ enormously in the quantity of human cost they carry.For that cost will depend upon the nature of the work, the nature of the workers, and the distribution of the work among the workers.This line of enquiry opens out, in form at any rate, a complete criticism of current English industry, from the humanist standpoint.A similar analysis applied on the consumption side resolves the economic utility of the goods and services into human utility.Here again out of economic utilities much human cost emerges, just as out of economic costs much human utility.Equal quantities of income yield In their consumption widely diverse quantities of human utility or welfare.Piecing together the two sides of our enquiry into the produc- tion and consumption of the income, we perceive, as might be expected, that a sound human economy conforms to the organic law of distribution, 'from each according to his power, to each ac- cording to his needs/ and that, precisely so far as the current processes of economic distribution of work and of its product con- travene this organic law, waste accrues and illfare displaces wel- fare.The economic distinction between costs and unearned surplus 1 furnishes in effect a faithful measure of the extent and forms of divergence between the economic and the human 'law' of distribution.For when this surplus income is traced, backward to the human costs involved in its production, forward to the human injuries inflicted by the excessive and bad consumption it sustains, it is seen to be the direct efficient cause of all the human defects in our economic system.Growing in magnitude with the development of the modern arts of industry and com- merce, it is the concrete embodiment of the social-economic 1 This distinction is elaborated in my work, The Industrial System (Longmans).viii PREFACE problem.The absorption and utilisation of the surplus for the betterment of the working-classes and the enrichment of public life are essential conditions for the humanisation of industry.The first half of the book is occupied with the general exposi- tion and illustration of this method of human valuation.The second part applies the humanist principles thus established, to the discussion of some of the great practical issues of social- economic reconstruction in the fields of business and politics.The medley of overlapping conflicts between capital and labour, producer and consumer, competition and combination, the individual and society, is sifted so as to discover lines of industrial reformation based upon a conception of organic harmony.The reconstruction of the business, so as adequately to represent in its operation the respective interests of capital, ability, labour and the consumer, is seen to be the first desideratum of reform.Here, as in the wider oppositions between business and business, trade and trade, nation and nation (misconceived as economic units), the more rational standpoint of a humanist valuation suggests modes of reconcilement following an evolution of economic structure in which the corporate or cooperative spirit finds clearer and stronger expression.The most debated ques- tion, how far ordinary human nature can yield economic motives to social service strong and reliable enough to enable society to dispense with some of the incentives of competitive greed, hitherto deemed indispensable supports to industry, is discussed in several of the later chapters.The practicable limits of in- dustrial reformation are found to depend upon the reality and importance assigned to 'the social will' as a power operative for industrial purposes, in other words upon the strength of the spiritual unity of society.A final chapter is given to a discussion of the limitations of the scientific and quantitative methods in the interpretation and direction of social-economic life.It is con- tended that the art of social as of individual conduct must always defy exact scientific guidance, the methods of science being incompetent closely to predict or direct the creative ele- ment in organic processes.The processes of human valuation and judgment, therefore, whether applied to industry or to other activities and achieve- PREFACE ix ments, must ultimately belong to the art rather than to the science of society, the statesman and the citizen absorbing and assimilating the history of the past which science presents in its facts and laws, but using his free constructive faculty to make the history of the future.The failures of the individual states- man or citizen in the performance of this artistic work are due to the fact that a larger artist, whose performance the most enlightened individual can but slightly apprehend, viz.society it- self, takes an over-ruling part in the process.This brief presentation of the argument, dwelling unavoidably upon intellectual method, may possibly have failed to convey the intensely practical purpose which I have kept in mind throughout the preparation of the book.That purpose is to present a full and formal exposure of the inhumanity and vital waste of modern industry by the close application of the best-approved formulas of individual and social welfare, and to indicate the most hopeful measures of remedy for a society sufficiently intelligent, coura- geous and self-governing to apply them.Such a work evidently presents a large frontfor hostile criticism.Its scope has often compelled a rigorous compression in the dis- cussion of important controversial topics, and has precluded all entrance upon the more detailed issues in the policy of reconstruc- tion.But I venture to hope that many readers, who may disagree with the particular valuations and interpretations offered in these chapters, will be led to accept the broader outlines of the method of human valuation here proposed, and will recognise the im- portance of a better application of this method in the solutions of the practical problems of economic reform.",

But that does not mean that they are living at the same time with others. Rather, they carry earlier things with them, things which are intricately involved. One has one's times according to where one stands corporeally, above all in terms of classes. Times older than the present continue to effect older strata; here it is easy to return or dream one's way back to older times. Certainly, a person who is simply awkward and who for that reason is not up to the demands of his position, is only personally unable to keep up. But what if there are other reaons why he does not fit into a very modern organization, such as the after-effects of peasant descent, what if he is an earlier type? In general, different years resound in the one that has just been recorded and prevails. Moreover, they do not emerge in a hidden way as previously but rather, they contradict the Now in a very peculiar way, awry, from the rear. The strength of this untimely course has become evident; it promised nothing less than new life, despite its looking to the old. Even the masses flock to it since the unbearable Now at least seems different with Hitler, who paints good old things for everyone. There is nothing more unexpected, nothing more dangerous than this power of being at once fiery and puny, contradicting and nonsynchronous. The workers are no longer alone with themselves and the bosses. Many earlier forces, from quite a different Below, are beginning to slip between.",

We cannot promote mental health in the same sense as we might an object or a personality not even in the same way that we might, in the interests of physical health, a diet or a set of exercises or even a life-style. The factors that contribute to the mental health of an individual or a society are too subtle, too tenuous; and the means by which they are achieved, on purpose or accidentally, are too diffused and too deeply enmeshed in our social roots to be easily affected by direct action. Even indirect action in this area is complex. Professionals in mental health might well decide that its interests would be served if, for example, more mentally handicapped people were shown in TV dramas to be leading comparatively normal lives, or if those who have nervous breakdowns were dealt with more sympathetically; they might think it better for characters to be shown coping with their problems mainly on their own or in their families, rather than invariably calling in a doctor. It might be thought a step forward, in our fragmented society, if there were more positive images of people living successfully on their own, rather than so often finding fulfillment only in a happy-ever-after partnership; it might help if someone with an alcohol problem were seen to tackle it successfully, rather than being portrayed only as a drunken lout. We could devise endless ways in which the media might further the cause of mental health; but there would be no obvious means by which we could induce editors and producers of programs to fall in with our wishes.",

      "title": "Happiness.",
      "abstract": "A philosophical question'What is happiness?'In these words one sometimes seeks a resolution of certain philosophical difficulties: Is happiness the satisfaction one obtains when one's desires are satisfied?Is it the capacity to be pleased with what one has and to enjoy what one does?Is the happy person one who enjoys life or one who has attained inner peace?How far does a person's happiness depend on his state of soul, his values and attitudes to things, and how far on his external circumstances.What can one do to be happy?Can the desire for happiness be anything other than a form of selfseeking?These and other questions come crowding in.Yet they do not come from ignorance.One who asks them knows well enough what the word means and what he or she is talking about.They are an expression of perplexity and seek for an order in one's appre- hension of what is familiar territory, for a clearer view of the application of the concept of happiness and its relations to a host of other concepts: enjoyment, pleasure, satisfaction, gladness, joy, doing what one wants, contentment, serenity, virtue, and many others.It is worth noting that the words 'What is happi- ness?' may also express a request for something dif- ferent: for one's conception of happiness to be made explicit.This involves bringing out what one considers to be of supreme importance in life.Here too one is called on to reflect on what one already knows, on 'what lies open to view'.But what is in question here is not the application of and the connections between concepts with which speakers of one's language are familiar.What is in question are one's own thoughts, attitude to life, desires and ambitions, beliefs and val- ues.The question this time calls for self-reflection, and this bears a certain resemblance to philosophical reflec- tion.It may even lead one to certain philosophical questions and so come to be intertwined with philo- sophical reflection.Two people can thus attach the same meaning to the word 'happiness' and yet have very different concep- tions of happiness.Consequently they may differ over whether or not someone is happy, as Socrates and Polus differed over whether Archelaus, the Macedo-",

      "abstract": "Two rival passions are at work in men's hearts to-day, the cult of individuality and the cult of society. They give rise all too often to extravagant praise of liberty and to a no less extravagant insistence on discipline for society's sake. It is impossible to form a balanced idea of the functions of liberty and discipline, or of the right relation between the individual and his social environment, without having a clear view of the nature of personality and community. I offer a brief and dogmatic sketch of this subject. A personality is the product of the impact of the objective universe, past and present, on a particular experiencing subject. I do not wish to imply that a “subject” is necessarily a substance (in the philosophical sense) or a metaphysical ego, or an immortal soul. Whether such eternal individual spirits exist or not, I do not pretend to know. I do not even, by the word “subject,” pledge myself to what Professor Broad has called a “centred theory” of the nature of mind, I do not know whether a mind is a system of experiences united in an enduring centre, as the spokes of a wheel are united in the hub; or whether it is a centreless “net” of experiences all related together in a special way. By “subject” I mean only “that which experiences,” whatever the true philosophical account of it. I mean the seeming focus or centre of experience and action. This focus is in some sense located in time and space, in fact it is located within the organism. For my purpose the subject is simply that to which experience happens, and that which responds with conscious behaviour. I do not wish to raise the epistemological problem. I merely assume the rejection of solipsism, and the reality of an objective universe which the individual experiences, however imperfectly.",

      "abstract": "Although grounded in the history of philosophy, Gilles Deleuze’s work does not begin with first principles but grasps the philosophical terrain ‘in the middle’. This method overthrows subject–object relations in order to initiate a philosophy of difference and chance that is not derived from static being; a philosophy of the event, not of the signifier-signified; a form of content that consists of a complex of forces that are not separable from their form of expression; the assemblage or body without organs, not the organized ego; time, intensity and duration instead of space; in short, a world in constant motion consisting of becomings and encounters with the ‘outside’ that such concepts do not grasp. This radical philosophical project is rendered most clearly in Deleuze (and his collaborator Guattari’s concept of the ‘rhizome’). The rhizome is a multiplicity without any unity that could fix a subject or object. Any point of the rhizome can and must be connected to any other, though in no fixed order and with no homogeneity. It can break or rupture at any point, yet old connections will start up again or new connections will be made; the rhizome’s connections thus have the character of a map, not a structural or generative formation. The rhizome, then, is no model, but a ‘line of flight’ that opens up the route for encounters and makes philosophy into cartography.",

      "abstract": "The issue of conscious activity has figured in our discussion both academically and politically since the founding of the People's Republic. However, up to now there are still people who are unclear about the issue and entertain many mistaken ideas about conscious activity. One case is mistaking conscious activity as voluntarism in which one can \"do whatever one likes\"; their blind and reckless action has in practice caused losses and damages to varying degrees. In another case conscious activity is confused with correctly bringing into play the role of conscious activity. Some think ideas and actions can be regarded as conscious activity only when they conform with the objective law. As they see things this way, they are bound to be overcautious in their practice; fearful of making a mistake, they would attempt nothing and accomplish nothing. There are still others who see conscious activity as something changeless. They do not understand that man's conscious activity can develop; it can evolve from spontaneity to self-consciousness and then to still higher self-consciousness. And it will play an increasingly greater role with the progress of science and technology and the development of history. Also there are people who believe one's action is free from any restriction or restraints, thus neglecting the necessity of an objective process.",

      "title": "Learning and decision-making in artificial animals",
      "abstract": "Abstract A computational model for artificial animals (animats) interacting with real or artificial ecosystems is presented. All animats use the same mechanisms for learning and decisionmaking. Each animat has its own set of needs and its own memory structure that undergoes continuous development and constitutes the basis for decision-making. The decision-making mechanism aims at keeping the needs of the animat as satisfied as possible for as long as possible. Reward and punishment are defined in terms of changes to the level of need satisfaction. The learning mechanisms are driven by prediction error relating to reward and punishment and are of two kinds: multi-objective local Q-learning and structural learning that alter the architecture of the memory structures by adding and removing nodes. The animat model has the following key properties: (1) autonomy: it operates in a fully automatic fashion, without any need for interaction with human engineers. In particular, it does not depend on human engineers to provide goals, tasks, or seed knowledge. Still, it can operate either with or without human interaction; (2) generality: it uses the same learning and decision-making mechanisms in all environments, e.g. desert environments and forest environments and for all animats, e.g. frog animats and bee animats; and (3) adequacy: it is able to learn basic forms of animal skills such as eating, drinking, locomotion, and navigation. Eight experiments are presented. The results obtained indicate that (i) dynamic memory structures are strictly more powerful than static; (ii) it is possible to use a fixed generic design to model basic cognitive processes of a wide range of animals and environments; and (iii) the animat framework enables a uniform and gradual approach to AGI, by successively taking on more challenging problems in the form of broader and more complex classes of environments",

      "title": "The theme of alienation in the works of Albert Camus",
      "abstract": "Perception of the absurd leads to rejection of God, but also to alienation from man through rejection of values. An ‘All or Nothing’ attitude (in any case often ambiguous) further alienates the absurd hero from the moderate mass of mankind. Caligula and others seek to re-establish values totally, through emulation of God. They fail because of their inadequate imitation, and are alienated from men through their absurd vision. Yet most Camus’s heroes seek union with man and the world. A quantitative concept of living is gradually abandoned for qualitative concepts such as ‘comprehension’. There is a movement from ‘All or Nothing’ towards ‘limits’, from solitude towards solidarity, but only within the human sphere: since the universe cannot be explained, there is economy of effort in concerning oneself only with man. Rieux for example seeks consolation for man’s condition through its temporary improvement. ‘Limits’ presuppose accepted values. The saint without God seeks to discover these independent of God, and faces too the problem of imposing values without causing harm. This leads to the passive approach of ‘comprehension’, and the movement from a search for principles to a faith in intuitive goodness. Man’s innocence is a prerequisite to his establishing of values independent of God. Camus focuses upon particular example of communion among men leading to happiness through escape from human alienation, whilst preserving lucid rejection in principle of man’s condition.",

When this happens, we may then fulfil our obligation to care for the other person not out of loving concern for them, but from other motives, such as the self-righteous satisfaction of having done our duty, or out of fear of not doing it. We thus find ourselves in a contradictory situation, of being faced by a demand on the one hand, which it is impossible to satisfy on the other, as the demand should not have arisen as a demand at all. When it does arise, we seem to be faced with a decision whether to act, and obey the demand for care; but for the agent who genuinely loves the other person, no such decision situation will arise, as no other option will appear to be available to them.",

      "title": "Love Without the Obligation to Love",
      "abstract": "Love Without the Obligation to Love1 Cindy Patton (bio) It’s frightening to feel so little attachment to a life that’s so full of the things other people long for—rightly long for, I think: a lot of intimacy, enough money, peace and privacy, intellectual stimulation, plenty of recognition, time for my own work, no violence, both parents living, mostly good health, a long, tender relationship with my fella, oodles of terrific friends. . . . It’s not that these things don’t seem miraculous. . . . I’ve the most acute sense that things not only could be infinitely worse, but actually are for most people. Though I can’t imagine why that’s supposed to be a cheering realization!2 [T]he naturalization of social arbitrariness causes it to be forgotten that, in order for this reality called “family” to be possible, certain social conditions that are in no way universal have to be fulfilled. . . . [T]he family in its legitimate definition is a privilege instituted into a universal norm: a de facto privilege that implies a symbolic privilege—the privilege of being comme il faut, conforming to the norm, and therefore enjoying a symbolic profit of normality. Those who have the privilege of having a “normal” family are able to demand the same of everyone without having to raise the question of the conditions (a certain income, living space, etc.) of universal access to what they demand universally.3 No reader—therapy fellow traveler, critic, homologously positioned academic or artist—can help but be moved by the eloquence with which Eve Sedgwick’s A Dialogue on Love conveys the gripping struggle with mortality, [End Page 215] not first in the face of her own cancer or others’ AIDS, but rather in the context of feeling out of place in the world. There is so much in the text and, yet, so few hints about how to be a worthy reader. In a classroom, one might be tempted to say, “What is Sedgwick saying?” But I remember a conversation with Eve in the late 1980s.4 I was grappling with how to write elegantly, recursively, but clearly in the then-popular deconstructionist High Style. I think I said, “I’m trying to communicate . . .” and she laughed in that high-pitched voice of hers, as delicate and tentative and unpredictable as a flat pebble skipping across the surface of a faintly rippled pond: “That’s the difference!” She described her writing process and explained that however much she shaped her prose through meticulous editing, it was the reader who would bend her works to their place and their meanings. Writing is poesis, not communication. From its title to its ending, through graphic design and shifts in voice and address, A Dialogue on Love is Sedgwick’s own high-water mark in this understanding of writing, blurring the line between forms of self-assertion and forms of listening, forms of intending meaning, and forms of not being heard. “Eve” plays hide and seek with the reader, offering various angles on her body and feelings, and then veiling these with (her therapist) Shannon’s words, perpetually grafting fragments of her poems onto fragments of therapy notes, sometimes Shannon’s official record, sometimes her therapy journals, in one moment her once estranged sister’s childhood diary accounts of Eve, in other places e-mail exchanges with friend Tim—any of which might be Kathy Acker–like plagiarism or faked autobiography.5 Although Eve did a great deal to make me smarter, I turned out to think like a busted-up social scientist, the bastard issue of qualitative empiricism and rhetorical deconstruction, a lost wild child from the literary turn in the social sciences (now passed, I note with regret). I therefore leave it to the literary critics to say how A Dialogue on Love works as a text and instead I open this particular iteration of Sedgwick’s corpus to a sociohistorical, or historicosocial, reading. I do not ignore her aesthetic devices, but recognize them as necessities for marking a place so personal and specific as sometimes not to communicate, as the techniques of a gifted mind that sprung from a quirky but quite...",

      "title": "Making Love with Needles: Knitted Objects as Signs of Love?",
      "abstract": "This article investigates the relationship between people and their things when the consumer or owner is also, potentially, the maker. By analyzing the ways in which people construct personal narratives and/or identities through the construction of specific items intended for themselves or others, this article aims to uncover intimate forms of object relations. Knitting is a relatively simple activity and is frequently done by hand. Stigmatized as old-fashioned, ugly, thrifty, domestic, and inherently feminine, both knitting and the objects resulting from its practice seemingly occupy a space that is neither craft nor design, yet the practice of knitting remains widespread and its objects, coveted, loved, accepted, rejected, and so on, as any object would be. Knitting has historically been associated with both familial and romantic love: of time spent thinking of someone whilst making, with the made object an expression of the sacrifice of time, of thoughtfulness, and the embodiment of feminine \"virtues\" of caring and nurturing. Equally, one can see the knitted object, when it is a garment or a toy, as close to the body, touching and being touched by the body, further extending its potential for intimacy. Yet, the communication of these values are only recognized if the object is received and used as the maker intended, and this article aims to highlight, through example, the ways in which such objects do not solely represent \"love,\" but also signify possessiveness, control, and domination. Referencing literature, magazine articles, objects, and makers' testimony, this article utilizes a design history and material culture methodology, which enables the discussion of both object and practice, as well as creating a model from which the object's biography can be evaluated.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Rituals are able to transform ordinary objects into extraordinary objects. And while rituals typically do not cause physical changes, they may imbue objects with a particular specialness – a simple gold band may become a wedding ring, while an ordinary dessert may become a birthday cake. To treat such objects as if they were ordinary then becomes inappropriate. How does this transformation take place in the minds of observers, and how do we recognize it when we see it? Here, we suggest that two under-examined elements of ritual need deeper consideration within the context of ritual cognition. We propose a fully integrated operational definition in which these two critical ritual elements – causal opacity and goal demotion – are included. In a pre-registered experiment one-hundred and one adults, in a 2 × 2 mixed-within participants design observed actions performed upon profane objects. These actions were either ordinary (causally transparent and goal apparent) or ritualized (causally opaque and goal demoted), and were described as a blessing, a curse, or were not described at all. Contrary to established findings and pre-registered predictions, we found that ritualized actions alone are not enough to influence perceptions of, and attributions towards, objects, and that positive goal information (blessings) are more behaviorally persuasive than negative information. However, we found that participants recalled ritualized action in greater detail and with more specificity than ordinary actions. In effect, we demonstrate that causal opacity and goal information interact to allow us to recognize a ritual as a ritual.",

      "abstract": "Adulteration is the wilful addition to an article of any substance or substances the presence of which is not acknowledged in the description under which the article is sold, or the abstraction from an article of an essential constituent without disclosing that it is impoverished. Some common synonyms are: corruption, defilement, debasement, vitiation and sophistication, all of which indicate the sinister nature of the act. Articles are adulterated to increase their weight or bulk, and to improve or change their appearance or flavour in imitation of an article of higher grade or different kind. In the limiting case it can be regarded as covering the complete substitution of one article for another. Wilful addition implies addition which could have been avoided and hence covers contamination brought about by lack of care. The term is used mainly in connexion with foods and drugs, but in practice extends to almost all manufactured products and is an almost inseparable accompaniment of trade competition. It will be observed that there are two requirements for adulteration, viz. an action and an intention. The mere act of mixing one thing with another does not, in itself, warrant the term adulteration. It must be coupled with an intention to deceive by passing off the mixed article as if it were unmixed. The intention is usually not apparent until some circumstance warrants the inference, such as the sale or exposure for sale of the article. The inclusion of such concepts as wilfulness and intention, which are much more difficult to prove than facts, introduces difficulties and prevents in practice the employment of a simple definition without provisions being made to protect the honest man from injustice. Accidental contamination or impurities unavoidably present, if not due to neglect or lack of reasonable care, are not normally regarded as adulteration unless the impurity is dangerous to health. In this country the only law which deals directly with adulteration is the Food and Drugs Act. The present Act, that of 1938, prohibits :—",

Yet not every human being is a person (slaves are not, for example), and there are some non-human entities (such as corporations) which are. The legal category of the person is thus at once continuous and discontinuous with that of the natural person, designating a subject of rights and duties along a spectrum from full to very partial personhood. Moreover, the mode of being of natural persons is by no means self-evident, because the status of the “natural” person is itself constituted by a juridical demarcation of the boundaries of embodied human being and by distinct institutional and practical conditions of constitution, and natural persons are not necessarily coextensive with their bodies. While Western models of personhood are based on the coherence and continuity of the self as rational or ethical substance, quite different ways of understanding personhood are found in other cultures, where persons may be taken to be the sum of their social relations or of the exchange of substances between their bodies and the rest of the social and material world. Similarly, in most cultures persons are constituted by their relation to the generations of the dead from whom they inherit, to the gods, and to the unborn descendants to whom property and some of the components of kinship (a name, a status, a genetic inheritance) are to be passed on.",

In dealing with the subject of effort it is much less possible than in any other to look upon the child solely as a miniature adult. The child who had been so timorous in her mortal fear summons up all her strength and shows utmost daring-and right judgment. The child's acts of will are not so much hostile interplay between the earliest feelings of impulse and instinct as their refinement, regulation and development; the child is only able to aim consciously at those ends which already exist as pronounced tendencies in the Unconscious. At no period of life is simple instruction and explanation so barren of results as in early childhood.",

      "abstract": "To know and to interact with other people requires predicting their actions, their reactions to one's own actions, and their interactions with other social beings, including oneself. The focus of this chapter is on the psychosocial knowledge required for successful interactions. Social beings are complex and their behavior is not entirely predictable; so also are some physical phenomena. But in coming to understand nonsocial objects, predictions about the behavior of those objects may be made with out concern for how those predictions may themselves alter the behavior of the objects. For example, predicting the weather is inherently fallible, because the system is so complex that very minor perturbations can have major unanticipated effects. But the predictions of weather scientists are not part of the system, and actions emanating from them do not affect the behavior of the system in any way. In contrast, a person within a social group of two or more people acts always with the knowledge that her own action may influence the actions of others in ways that she must be able to predict if she is to act intelligently.",

They fail to deal satisfactorily with many important problems, and even when they do work, they rely on ideas that have to be derived from deeper, usually unacknowledged principles. This article proposes that the parent principle is always human dignity, and that one will get more satisfactory answers if one interrogates the older, wiser parent instead of the younger, callow offspring. But human dignity has a credibility problem. It is often seen as hopelessly amorphous or incurably theological. These accusations are often just. But a more thorough exegesis exculpates dignity and gives it its proper place at the fountainhead of bioethics. Dignity is objective human thriving. Thriving considerations can and should be applied to dead people as well as live ones. To use dignity properly, the unit of bioethical analysis needs to be the whole transaction rather than (for instance) the doctor-patient relationship. The dignity interests of all the stakeholders are assessed in a sort of utilitarianism. Its use in relation to body part ownership is demonstrated. Article 8(1) of the European Convention of Human Rights endorses and mandates this approach.",

      "title": "HASID AND HARHAM ? PARADOXICAL STORIES FOUND IN THE CABBALISTIC ETHICAL LITERATURE*",
      "abstract": "The heart of the paradoxical tale is a reversal of expectations. In some stories of this nature, the person who is least expected to be seen to have or to acquire a role of exalted significance in reality does have or does attain such a role. Or, such a person might come to be looked upon as an ideal figure frequently at the expense of those situated at a society's center. This kind of tale is, understandably, often viewed as emerging from the more marginal sectors of a population whose members possess neither authority nor status in their societies. In various Jewish tales of such a paradoxical character, the posited center of Jewish society is identified with the institu tions of Torah-learning, while the more marginal members are those who are basically unlearned, lacking the benefits of study and sometimes lacking even a familiarity with the accepted norms of religious life and behavior.1 In such tales, God is impressed not with the wealth of one's knowledge, but rather with the depth of inner intent which is itself not contingent upon knowledge. If such paradoxical stories reflect social protest, they also voice a pietistic strain in Jewish thought and teaching which emphasized the importance of inner intent and spirituality and which regarded Torah-learning and knowl edge as seriously wanting if unaccompanied by the qualities of personal piety. The Cabbalistic ethical literature of the sixteenth through the mid eighteenth centuries, popular pietistic writings which essentially distilled the particular mode of Jewish mysticism which emerged in sixteenth-century Safed into a form intended for large numbers of Jews, includes various tales which, prior to or following analysis, can be identified as paradoxical stories. These stories generally establish, on some level, a polarity between the hakham, the learned sage, and the hasid, the devout Jew whose way in life is not necessarily dependent upon intellectual attainment or who transcends the value of learning per se. In some examples,2 that polarity is thoroughly explicit. But in others either only one of the figures of this polarity might actually be present in the tale, the two worlds of values might even be present within the same person, or the contrast between the figures defined in those terms might be quite implicit. These stories can be read only with the more normative scale of values (e.g., extolling the scholar and the place of Torah learning, with its expectations and responses) in the background of the tale, a norm which the story serves to negate or to refine. These stories either define the values of the hasid as indispensible to the ideal of the hakham in its completeness or assert the priority of the value-complex of the hasid over that of the hakham. In analyzing four such stories and focusing upon the implications of some of the relationships within the stories, our ultimate concern will be to seek an explanation for the affinity of Jewish mysticism of the sixteenth century and of following centuries for the paradoxical tale, an affinity which goes beyond the sociological impact of the stories and even beyond the ideology of pietism itself; it is an affinity which has to do more with the essential and underlying ethos of the period. 52",

Can we escape the habits and inheritance of the 'inside, is this even desirable, so as to make practice resonate, respond or be relevant to that which might come to matter on the outside … and who decides what matters? Thus, pedagogic work in holding out a hand and leading outside requires a series of obligations of support for the challenges, leaps and reflections that a learner or a teacher is encouraged to take and make. Though it is important for pedagogical practices to introduce learners to the inheritance of tradition and established forms of knowledge and practice that constitute the known world in order to conceive and produce their own iterations, it is also crucial to view teachers and learners as speculative innovators enabling potentials for a world to come, a world that is not yet known and which cannot, in the didactic sense of prescription, be fully controlled or predicted, nor fully accommodated by established orders.",

Darwin (1871/1982) repeatedly referred to the “moral sense.” He asserted, “Any animal whatever, endowed with a well-marked social instinct, the parental and filial affections being here included, would inevitably acquire a moral sense of conscience, as soon as its intellectual power had become as well or nearly as well developed as in man” (p. 95).

      "title": "De-pathologizing love in therapeutic care: Attending to an unwitting hermeneutical violence",
      "abstract": "This paper addresses the nature of pathologization in general and the pathologization of love in therapeutic care in particular. “Pathologized or pathologization[u1] ,” means an event, person, action, thought, feeling, or circumstance that is de-valuated as “less than,” as compromised or broken, and unwittingly (ironically, in the name of love) demeaned, belittled, ignored, jettisoned or ostracized for its not-enough-ness, its incorrectness, or its inadequacy in light of rank-ordered scales of measured worth. The pathologist presumes an essentialist hegemony [ctsq2] should be healthy love, consequentiality, views any expression less than this prescription as a privation or pathologization of healthy love, and is thus immature, ill, or unethical. Common ways therapists pathologize love in therapeutic space include the use of a modified against nature argument; which today is reframed as an against the status quo argument. The use of inflection and body language that communicates disapproval are, enacting[u3] ideologies of deficit-correction that inherently stigmatize, interpreting expressions of love “as other than it is,” or, “as nothing but something else,” such as adoration interpreted as really dependency or teenaged pining as merely raging hormones. Essentialist rank-ordered scaling inherent in these forms of pathologization is deconstructed, then explored in terms of the impact of this deconstruction in therapeutic care. The essay is concluded[u4] with suggestions of how to care for expressions of love in non-pathologizing ways within therapeutic space.",

      "title": "Pride, Shame, and Group Identification",
      "abstract": "Self-conscious emotions such as shame and pride are emotions that typically focus on the self of the person who feels them. In other words, the intentional object of these emotions is assumed to be the subject that experiences them. Many reasons speak in its favor and yet this account seems to leave a question open: how to cash out those cases in which one genuinely feels ashamed or proud of what someone else does? This paper contends that such cases do not necessarily challenge the idea that shame and pride are about the emoting subject. Rather, we claim that some of the most paradigmatic scenarios of shame and pride induced by others can be accommodated by taking seriously the consideration that, in such cases, the subject “group-identifies” with the other. This is the idea that, in feeling these forms of shame or pride, the subject is conceiving of herself as a member of the same group as the subject acting shamefully or in an admirable way. In other words, these peculiar emotive responses are elicited in the subject insofar as, and to the extent that, she is (or sees herself as being) a member of a group – the group to which those who act shamefully or admirably also belong. By looking into the way in which the notion of group identification can allow for an account of hetero-induced shame and pride, this paper attempts to achieve a sort of mutual enlightenment that brings to light not only an important and generally neglected form of self-conscious emotions, but also relevant features of group identification. In particular, it generates evidence for the idea that group identification is a psychological process that the subject does not have to carry out intentionally in the sense that it is not necessarily triggered by the subject’s conative states like desires or intentions.",

This chapter argues that the most plausible perfectionism is consequentialist, identifying right actions by the quantity of good they result in; tells us to maximize the good rather than satisfice; and is time‐ and agent‐neutral, so we should care equally about perfections at all times and in all lives. That we should pursue others’ perfections as much as our own goes against a common view of narrow perfectionism as egoistic, but is necessary if the view does not make each person's perfection involve acting virtuously toward others. It can also be obscured if people can promote others’ perfection less well than their own and if their perfections often cooperate, so one's achieving them encourages rather than retards others’ doing so.",

One of the main aspects of contemporary society is excessive consumption, in fact relativism, secularism and subjectivism. These phenomena, in their psychological and theological sense, promote the disintegration of the integrity of the human person. This phenomenon becomes very visible in cases of illness, suffering and death. The modern man has lost the harmony between the body, the spirit and the soul, and at the same time the right relationship with God. It does arise in human life between the various dimensions of life: personal self-awareness, family, work, business, work, and other fields. Without faith, postmodernism does not accept man’s inevitability of death, strives to ignore it, or simply flee from it. But this does not give peace to human. The search for the meaning of life and death is in the nature of man, so only believing in a supernatural world, the fostering of spiritual values gives real hope.

When the conditions of possibility for the indicator's continued existence are less assured, the labor it takes to build numbers into something socially meaningful becomes surprisingly visible. This labor proceeds in stops and starts, as the various material and epistemological and social resistances reveal themselves. Sensors shape these starts and stops. Sensors give their users an indication of a possible whole entity whose contents they cannot fully imagine, and either must create or abandon. Far from producing certainty, sensor data often provokes a sense of vagueness that is worked on until it becomes either clarity or action, failure or indifference. Through this view of numbers in the making, we can see just how remarkable it is that indicators become part of calculative infrastructures at all.",

      "abstract": "If a hungry, thirsty, itchy person eats some food, or drinks some water, or intentionally scratches an itch, this is individual action. That is, it is the intentional behaviour of an ordinary individual human person; other human beings are not necessarily involved. If a person takes a walk down the road by herself for exercise, or eats an ice cream for pleasure, or takes a shower on a hot day, this is also individual action. Such action is not action in cooperation with, or necessarily directed at, other individuals. On the other hand, if an individual kicks or throws a football to a teammate in the course of a game of football, or puts a motion forward at a committee meeting, then this is social action. Most human action is in fact at some level, or to some extent, or in some sense, social action. Even these actions of eating, drinking, eating ice cream, individually walking down the road, or having a shower typically presuppose social forms or objects, such as farms, ice cream parlours, cups, roads, and shower rooms. But the de facto presupposition of social forms does not of itself vitiate the distinction between individual and social action. More generally, the sociality of most human action does not vitiate the distinction; it merely serves to illustrate the need to develop a more elaborate set of distinctions in this area. There is nothing to be gained from insisting that no actions are individual and/or that all actions are social, just because it might in fact be that all the actions of human beings connect in some way, however indirectly, with the actions of other human beings and with social forms and social objects.",

      "abstract": "We often talk of man as a being capable of making alternative choices i.e. of having the power to choose between alternative courses of action particularly after careful deliberation. We also notice that at times a man abandon a course of action say a religion for another. We are also found of blaming or praising people, punishing or rewarding people, discouraging or encouraging people. At other time, laws are enacted that may urge people to take certain actions and forbid them to take other actions. Whenever any and, or all of these things are done, the underlined assumption is that man has freedom of the will. On the other hand, it could sometime be argued that a man who does things in a certain way could not have done otherwise. At times the observation could be that certain persons behave in ways and manners dictated by orientation background, their economic beliefs or their religious upbringing. We also notice the element of environmental influences in people's behaviour. This state of affairs sometime make us to wonder whether we are really free moral agents or whether our actions are not after all determined by forces and circumstances beyond our control. In this paper while it is recognized that human actions could be determined, the paper submits that man has the free will to choose the course of the action he likes and he, at the same time bears responsibility for all his actions.African Journal of Cross-Cultural psychology and sport facilitation (AJCPSF) Vol. 9 2007: pp. 26-36",

      "abstract": "What can an attention to affect offer those of us who continue to be engaged by criticism, who do it for a living or find it indispensable for some other reasons? For one thing, thinking about affect can change what counts as material and what material might do. I am using word material in psychoanalytic sense to mean the patient's words and behaviour as a whole, in so far as they offer a sort of raw material for interpretations and constructions.1 Affect is part of what an analyst or critic considers in order to build a convincing interpretation (of a lived scene, of a literary or cultural text): one sign that I am performing a good reading or interpreting well is if this reading helps me to understand why I feel a certain way, or why a text makes me feel this way. This is especially case if a feeling is counterintuitive or perverse in sense that it undermines or is simply outside of what I recognize to be my own desires or wishes. Affects or feelings fit psychoanalytic bill perfectly when they are felt to be, as Laplanche and Pontalis put it, somewhat alien ... as far as conscious subject is concerned (246); when they are considered incommensurate with [a subject's] conscious motives (246), they become material for analysis, symptomatic of unconscious wishes, for example, or structures.",

Conversation progresses on the assumption of such co-avowal, as we each manifestly endorse an increasing set of common attitudes, enabling any one of us to presume on the authorization of others to speak for what we all believe or want. And so, the motive for conversation explains the motive for co-avowal. We can have the confidence to make this sort of co-avowal insofar as we can presume on the common availability of certain data and desiderata and on our having broadly common dispositions to respond to these. I may also co-avow or co-pledge the intentions of individual others as well as myself but only in special circumstances; and I may co-avow or co-pledge the special intentions I hold jointly with others, whether within or without corporate bodies.

But a truly meaningful life, one whose meaning (direction) is determined in regards to man's true end -- which is the knowledge and love of the greatest good -- does indeed require a host of virtues belonging to fortitude. The virtue of temperance is thus not enough for emotional well-being, since temperance deals with the greatest pleasures, not the greatest difficulties. Rather, it belongs to fortitude to remove the obstacles that withdraw the will from following reason on account of difficulties that give rise to fear and/or daring.",

      "title": "Recognition and Receptiveness in Forming a Small Group",
      "abstract": "A man can't live with stability if he is isolated. Between himself and others, he has interactions, and through repetition of them he tries to be a member of a small group consisted of himself and others.When he finds himself in this group, he attains stability through the union of his true individual self with the group. With the stability of this base, he can face other new external objects in a positive way. In this sense, a small group is essential support to one's stability.It is the level of interactions between them that decides the degree of forming of a small group. One of the most primary interaction is, I think, the recognition and the perceptiveness between oneself and the others.There are four such levels:1) Self-need centered levelThe main purpose is to satisfy one's own wants mutually. When one's wants have been satisfied, interactions are finished. The most important point in this level is the result of the others action. Recognition and perceptiveness to others are not necessary. At this level there are interactions, but the group is not yet formed.2) Subjective levelThrough repetition of interactions, recognition and receptiveness are met. But, there is some subjective bias from which some confusion springs on the way to forming a group. This subjective bias results chiefly from the individuals self-defense and individuality synthesis.3) Objective levelUsually what is called the scientific method. It selects and catches from the others phenomena which can be reasonably applicable to a certain general standard. It is apt to neglect the synthetic function of the others as a whole. So they can't get sufficient recognition and receptiveness to others. As a result, forming a group is limited.4) Emphathetic levelThis is the method by which we recognize and recieve the whole synthetic function as it is, understanding the others not as the objects but as the subjects. When an interaction is done by this method, it will get deeper and it becomes more reasonable to understand each other as a human. The common domain of the Recognition and Receptiveness shows the maximum expantion. Here, the small group becomes the most mature one.In the practical formations of small groups, these levels are partly overlapped by each other. But this classification will give an effective method for the analysis and appreciation of a group and to the educational and critical direction to make a group mature. It also suggests that in studies about human, human-relations, and a group, the subjective synthesis function should be put at the center.",

Once you have acquired a skill—in sports, dance, music, and elsewhere—attention to what you are doing is seen as unnecessary and even harmful. Echoing a theme that one finds in a number of diverse intellectual traditions, the philosopher David Velleman tells us that, after the requisite training, experts act “without deliberate intention or effort,” or as the psychologist Sian Beilock puts it, experts should “just do it.” But is this true? The aim of this chapter is neither to bury nor even less to praise this sort of “just-do-it” attitude but rather to illustrate various contemporary manifestations of the principle in popular culture, philosophy, psychology, and neuroscience, as well as some of its historical antecedents in Romanticism, Zen Buddhism, and Taoism.",

      "abstract": "A widespread ritual institution in Central and Southern Africa is often referred to, or carries the name, of ngoma, at once the term for drum, as well as drumming or other musical instrumentation, singing, dancing, and the complex of constituent behavior and concepts. Particular manifestations of the institution often carry names denoting a regional or local variant that emerged at a certain time and spread into neighboring regions. Across the region where ngoma type rituals are located-much of Central and Southern Africa, and certain areas of Equatorial Africa-common characteristics include recruitment of those afflicted by a disease, chronic handicap, or social pathology; an initiation-like therapeutic course of several months or years leading from novice to fully-qualified healer status; a redefinition of the self or social group that has been defined as sick, and subsequently stabilized; an etiology of spirit possession that may occasionally be reflected in overt trance, but is often merely hypothesized and dealt with analytically; the tendency to think of the process of going through affliction and healing as a kind of legitimation for other leadership positions in society. This set of features, occasionally in association with the notion ngoma, has usually been studied and presented by scholars as a local, or tribally-particular phenomenon. This view distorts and trivializes the institution. The present paper is a distillation of a decade-long study of ngoma that has been historical and comparative in scope. This work will be published shortly in a complete monograph.1",

For Buddhists, generosity is fundamentally about not being attached to things. These things might be material wealth but can also be more abstract things like time, knowledge, or even recognition. A generous individual sees clearly that there is no persisting self through time, so rather than holding on to these things lets them go easily. Meanwhile, selfless giving is strongly emphasized in a practice associated with Japanese Buddhism where the individual helps others secretly, without anyone knowing. This is a way of making sure that the giving is totally free from any hint of desire for praise or recognition. This kind of generosity is not done to get thanks nor is it done to make others see how virtuous the individual is. It is done solely to benefit others.",

      "abstract": "150 BOOK REVIEWS on them the ability to judge more surely in the practical order than can those who have only book knowledge (cf. STh 11-11, q. 45, a. 2, on the gift of wisdom, with the example of chastity). Each virtue, or more precisely all the virtues united in the active experience, provide such a knowledge which is specifically moral. The knowledge through experience that is given by the gifts is inseparable from that proceeding from the virtues, for the organism of virtues and gifts, united in the believer, intervenes integrally in the concrete action. The gifts are rooted in the theologal virtues and cannot be separated from them. Nevertheless, the experience of the gifts possesses its own special character, an awareness of an inspiration or a motion of the Spirit calling for docility and inciting to action. From the subject's point of view the modality is more passive or receptive. There is a sense of being moved by another, while at the same time acting very personally in faith, confidence, and love. Many other things could be said about this beautiful book which touches upon numerous problems. I only hope these lines will be sufficient to make it appreciated. (Translated by Sr. Mary Thomas Noble, O.P.) SERVAIS PINCKAERS, 0.P. Albertinum Fribourg, Switzerland The Beginning and the End of \"Religion.\" By NICHOLAS LASH. New York: Cambridge University Press, 1996. Pp. 284. $54.95 (cloth). ISBN 0-521-56232-5. About halfway into this book of collected essays, Nicholas Lash mentions that he keeps at home a poster from the British Government's Propaganda Office during World War II, one of a series meant to sustain high levels of vigilance in the civilian population. Its message: \"Careless talk costs lives\" (127). Only slightly altered, this monitum could also serve as the epigraph to what, in retrospect, makes for a remarkably cohesive assemblage of essays: \"careless God-talk corrodes faith.\" Like a leitmotifin an opera, Lash, the Norris-Hulse Professor of Divinity at the University of Cambridge, alerts the reader to this central concern of his, as when he defines theologians as those people \"who watch their language in the presence of God\" (59), or when he wittily points out that too often in contemporary theology the bandying about of the term \"ineffability\" has become an all-purpose cop-out for hard theological analysis: \"As the God of modern deism fades from view like Lewis Carroll's Cheshire Cat, his only trace a smile of vague and indeterminate benignity, some people BOOK REVIEWS 151 construe ineffability to mean that we may say, concerning God, more or less whatever takes our fancy\" (58). But more centrally, this motif emerges both from the author's insistence that words be defined carefully and from his own consistency in their use. This requirement has become especially exigent in today's global civilization, where nearly everyone is aware that past traditions are now colliding in a \"clash of civilizations,\" so that it becomes imperative to speak across traditions in a way that both respects the integrity of the other tradition and yet also allows real conversation to occur. Consider this dilemma: In contemporary uses of the word \"god,\" there is a common carelessness which takes two forms. On the one hand, we find it far too easy to label as \"gods\" whatever other people worship and, on the strength of this ascription, to judge such people to be \"polytheists.\" Whereas, of course, although \"we\" reverence, cherish, hold in high respect and worthy of devotion a great diversity of people, values, things, ideas and dreams, we suppose ourselves to worship only that which we call \"god.\" (31) This passage occurs in part 1 of this two-part book, that is, the section devoted to the encounter of Hinduism and Christianity (the three chapters of this section are made up of Lash's Teape Lectures in India, which were established by the Revered W. M. Teape to promote Hindu-Christian relations), where these kinds of misinterpretations are especially tempting. Soi-disant monotheists are especially prone to look on apparently \"polytheist\" religions and cultures as tautologically idolatrous, but Lash insists that this too-easy classification...",

      "title": "Discussion: The Values of Life",
      "abstract": "In Life's Dominion, Dworkin aims at defusing the controversy about abortion and euthanasia by redefining its terms. Basically, it is not a dispute about the right to life, but about its value. Liberals should grant that human life has not only a personal, but also an intrinsic value; conservatives should accept the principle of toleration, which requires to let people decide for themselves about matters of intrinsic value. Dworkin fails, however, to distinguish between two kinds of personal value: (1) the value of something to a person, when he actually or dispositionally desires it, or finds it pleasant; and (2) the value of something to a person, when it 'objectively' contributes to his well-being, as defined by reference to his personal point of view, whether or not he ever perceives it as so contributing. He also fails to distinguish between two meanings of the concept of 'intrinsic value': (3) ultimate, i.e., non-instrumental personal value of kind (2); (4) the impersonal value of something which is not good-for-anybody, but simply good, i.e., not a constituent of someone's well-being. Dworkin argues that the human fetus from conception onwards has a value, that it is not a personal value of kind (1), and, therefore, must be an intrinsic value. But the value of the life of the fetus is not a personal value of kind (2) either and, therefore, not an intrinsic value of kind (3): it is normally a constituent of the well-being of the pregnant woman, but that doesn't constitute its value, and it is not good 'for' the fetus itself in the relevant sense, because it doesn't have a personal point of view. If, however, the fetus' life is allowed to have an intrinsic value of kind (4), the conservative cannot be refuted by appeal to the principle of toleration, for this only concerns intrinsic value of kind (3). The liberal, indeed, should recognize that the fetus' life has a value, but it is neither a personal value (1) or (2), nor an impersonal value (4), but rather a relational value which gradually develops from some point substantially later than conception.",

      "abstract": "This paper argues that the agent-based simulation approach is just the one appropriate to the social sciences (including economics). Although there were many predecessor approaches, which tried to build formal models of social systems, all of them fell short of the peculiar features of the objects of all social sciences: complex systems consisting of numerous autonomous actors who interact with each other, who take on different roles at the same time, who are conscious of their interactions and roles and who can communicate with the help of symbolic languages even about the counterfactual.\r\n\r\nThese human actors are unlike physical particles although their behaviour might sometimes be quite similar to the behaviour of physical particles when humans occur in very large numbers (but they are most interesting when they form only small networks). Real human actors would not concede that their behaviour is stochastic, they will always assert that their actions are deliberate (but at the same time these actions are not entirely predictable). Human actors are not entirely rational although their behaviour might sometimes seem as if they were (but they are most interesting when their rationality is only bounded and when their payoff is multidimensional).\r\n\r\nSocial systems seem to be the most adaptive systems that we know about, and this is why we could perhaps use them as patterns for artificial adaptive systems --- and if we knew enough about the modes of operations of human social systems, social sciences could even contribute to agent-based modelling in other fields.",

In this article my purpose is to demostrate that disability is a personal election and that as disabled and handicapped people we have the capacity to teach persons in the same conditions, and to the whole world, that we are superior to our external appearance since we are ordinary human beings, despite of our difference. “Normal” or “complete” persons can as well suffer unfulfillment, dissatisfaction or functional differences leading to various emotional and spiritual difficulties to relate with other people.

      "title": "On Huizinga's Theory of Play",
      "abstract": "The play that Huizinga had discussed was mainly that of social one namely, game. He argued that we should take hold of play by the way of characteristics—describing. The characteristics of play that he had described were mainly as follows: (1) Voluntary or free. Play is a kind of life-activity that is free in the meaning of ″voluntary″. (2) Dummy or of pretending to believe, of internal purpose and of non-material benefits. Play is a kind of dummy activity that organisms pretend to believe it as true and treat it seriously. In the playtime, organisms take the activity itself as the internal purpose, and do not seek for external material benefits. Therefore, play is a kind of activity that is of non-material benefits. (3) Obstructed. People play in particular time and space and with the abidance of particular rules that differ from that of realistic activities, which make play have a kind of insulation opposite to realistic activities. (4) The absoluteness or authority of the rules of games and the beauty-appreciatability of the forms of games. The rules are the necessary conditions for collective activities. For the games' going in gear, the rules of games must be valid generally or absolutely to all participants. Games in ideal conditions have the high orders, and therefore have the beauty-appreciatability of the forms of games. Tally up the above-mentioned characteristics of play, we can express Huizinga's basic viewpoint of play as follows: Play is a kind of dummy activity in which people take the activity itself as the internal purpose and therefore do not seek for external benefits. In the characteristics that Huizinga had described, the purpose's internality of the activity is most fundamental. Seizing this fundamental characteristic, we can briefly recapitulate Huizinga's viewpoint of play as follows: Play is a kind of life-activity in which people take the activity itself as the internal purpose. This is just Huizinga's viewpoint of play on the theory of internal purpose. There were actually several concepts of play at different levels from wide sense to narrow sense in Huizinga's mind: play in the wide sense refers to all dummy activities in which people take the activity itself as the internal purpose (including individual play and collective play); play in the middle sense refers to collective play—social game played by people in particular time and space (for leisure) and according to particular rules; and play in the narrow sense refers to competitive game—collective play with the characteristic of competition in which people aim at the satisfaction of the demand of pursuing superiority and other related mental demands. In discussing the relationship between mankind's culture and play, what Huizinga called (″play″) only refers to competitive game actually. Huizinga's play theory is mainly that about collective play, especially, about competitive game. The applicability of his play theory was waiting to be documented further. His theory of internal purpose about play—taking (the activity) itself as the purpose—contains the logic error of confusing means with purpose, therefore, his linguistic expression for the theory is not accurate.",

      "abstract": "Awe is a positive emotion that occurs when people are in the presence of something extraordinary and beyond their typical experiences, from transformative views of majestic landscapes to the face of one's child. Recent evidence suggests that more everyday experiences can also evoke mild feelings of awe, and that these feelings can have benefits for people's lives. Accumulating evidence suggests that awe has several benefits for physical health, and might reduce the likelihood of developing chronic conditions. Awe also tends to prompt self-transcendence, resulting in the sense of a \"small self\" that shifts people's focus towards others and the world around them. People who have experienced awe are more prosocial and helpful. They are also more creative and less likely to use stereotypes in their decision making. Over time, there is evidence that awe can improve well-being and satisfaction. Considering the grandness of the emotion of awe, it does not seem intuitive to establish a connection between awe and a relatively ordinary workplace setting. However, this chapter reviews several directions for organizations and individuals to improve their work environment and climate by fostering a sense of awe in the workplace.",

But one of the contributions of the flow concept has been to remind us that activity and experience are ultimately independent of each other.

It is impossible to explain the quality of the experience by reference to the objective conditions of the environment, or by reference to the person alone; only the interaction between the two yields the answer.",

Are the coherence and the rationality of protocols and procedures not defied when it is appropriate to acknowledge a certain shared vulnerability, a parenthesis, or another way of behaving, even a loss of control—detours that are necessary for managing to restore relationships? Is there an “ethics of care for pain” that would help to clarify some points of reference for legitimate presence and good practices, to establish principles that can be transposed into attitudes and gestures, that are respectful of the person?

      "title": "Trapped in a metaphor",
      "abstract": "I have no trouble accepting the major conclusions of James Q. Wilson there are aspects of our moral life are universal(1) and these aspects can be called fundamental dispositions[226], which we might label sympathy, fairness, self-control, and duty. I take this proposition to be a self-evident product of the fact humans are bound together mutual interdependence [xii] in collectivities we call societies. Without acts demonstrating thoughtfulness, fairness, and duty shown toward at least some others, without self-control expressed in at least some arenas of desire, a functioning, healthy social collectivity would not be possible. In other words, at a certain level of generality the kinds of moral senses Wilson describes can be found anywhere among the social animals. In presenting his universalist argument, Wilson classifies anthropologists as either relativists or universalists. I am neither. I would classify myself as a culturalist interested in how generic human potentialities are focused in specific performances. In particular, I am interested in the ways in which metaphors trap people in a self-absorbed cycle of violence or free them to work for the common good. In this short essay, I will first discuss the area in which I agree with Wilson. I will then move on to the area of disagreement by presenting a short case study of the moral senses based on fieldwork in a modern Southeast Asian matriarchy. I include this information partly because of Wilson's claim matriarchies have never existed and partly to out-line the logic of an approach to the moral senses which is neither relativist nor universalist. Contemporary American Society Wilson's discussion of contemporary American society offers me much food for thought. I applaud his criticism of the all-too-frequent tendency for social scientists to suspend judgment. However, he is a little too fixated on anthropologists when making this criticism. In my mind, this tendency is widespread in academia. In today's climate of identity politics it takes courage to speak in behalf of the common good. If not judged harshly by one's colleagues, one can expect to disappear altogether from the list of names announced in grant awards. I agree we live in a world shaped by the ambiguous legacy of the Enlightenment[244]. On this point I would like to push further. As Wilson points out, we inherit from the Enlightenment the idea each and every citizen is entitled to equal and opportunity along with the notion that man must be treated as an end and not merely as a means to someone else's[245]. The first idea emphasizes equality for all; the second, for the individual. Recently, we have become a society worships rights, but not equality. The closer America inches toward sympathy (we are all brothers under the skin) or fairness (I am entitled to the same rewards for a given effort as you) the more we hear of rights talk[245]. Wilson provides a telling quote from Ronald Dworkin: [I]f someone has a right to do something, then it is wrong for the government to deny it to him even though it would be in the general interest to do so[245]. In the current climate of politics, Dworkin's words have a far greater capacity to move the nation than the words of those who preach sympathy and fairness. The contemporary rhetoric seems unable to comprehend the necessity of finding a balance between individual and the social good. There are dangers in moving too far in either direction. Too much concern for the common good can lead to fascism, too little concern can lead to social extinction. America has lost its bearings with respect to the common good. Increasingly we seem to be moving toward a Hobbesian war of all against all. Everyday, we learn about another crime of violence, be it hate crime, wife abuse, murder, drive-by shooting, or children killing one another in the schools. …",

      "title": "What Is General Semantics?: A Personal View.",
      "abstract": "Sometimes when people ask What General Semantics?, don't want to answer. My reluctance to categorize general semantics arises from the general semantics principle of non-identity. This postulates that no two things are identical in all respects. Suppose say, a Such a sentence uses a form of is called the is-of-identity. It violates the non-identity principle. In effect, I've said, individual noun (Pat) equals class noun (politician), X identical to Y, identical to This seems harmless, you say. Not so! Tunnel Vision I've confused the specific with the general, confused things with words, and imposed linguistic limitations that do not reflect the rich diversity of a living human who has personality, hopes, habits, a certain physique, etc. I've reduced Pat to a label, politician. My self-imposed tunnel vision will prejudge and damage my relationship with Pat. By treating this individual as identical to a class, category, or group, can't help but think and act as if all politicians are alike. If a particular politician has disappointed me, will probably react badly to all. Labels That Limit Suppose we have a task to do, and we only have a We can say, I can't do it, only have a screwdriver. In practice, we can use a screwdriver to drive screws, to hammer, chisel, lever, wedge, garden, open cans, crack ice, stir liquids, etc. Similarly, we can use the numerous tools of general semantics to achieve diverse goals. Hence my reluctance to limit general semantics with is-of-identity labeling. Yet to describe, we must focus, select, abstract. Incidentally, a key formulation of the system of general semantics says that we process information at biological and verbal levels by abstracting, by leaving things out. We've chosen not to describe the system by means of the is-of-identity, by what it is. We can describe something by what it does. Success and Survival think of general semantics as a system for making evaluations vital to success and survival. By evaluating, mean our processing of perceptions and inferences as influenced by existing conscious and unconscious assumptions. Evaluations, not necessarily conscious ones, involve our thoughts, feelings, judgments, decisions, etc. Generally we do something as a result. Evaluating leads to appropriate or inappropriate action. We might describe general semantics as an integrated system for improving our thinking, evaluating, communicating, etc. Of course, in doing so we've only just begun. Alfred Korzybski formulated general semantics in the first half of this century in his major work, Science and Sanity, and he continued to write and lecture about general semantics until his death in 1950. Numerous educators, writers, and editors have continued to develop and disseminate his work, including Irving J. Lee, Wendell Johnson, Harry Weinberg, Francis Chisholm, Kenneth Johnson, S. I. Hayakawa, Elwood Murray, Russell Joyner, Robert Pula, Anatol Rapoport, Mary Morain, D. David Bourland, Jr., Susan Presby Kodish, Bruce I. Kodish, Earl Hautala, Jeremy Klein, and Gregory Sawin. Beyond Aristotle Korzybski called general semantics a non-Aristotelian system because its many-valued logic goes beyond the two-valued, either-or logic attributed to Aristotle. Two-valued Aristotelian logic says either X Y, or X not Y; it offers no middle choices, and it often leads to either-or evaluating. Non-Aristotelian logic employs multiple values, a range of choices, more in keeping with the diversity of lived experience. It adheres to the principle of non-identity by allowing degrees of difference or similarity. Separation of Word and Thing Korzybski recognized that language and lived experience consist of two distinctly separate realms. He said The word not the thing, and Whatever you might say the object 'is,' well, it not. …",

When the line of development from self-preservative aggression to the libidinalization of aggression progresses to the intensification of sadism, the psychic groundwork is laid for the use of sadism as a solution to neurotic or psychotic conflicts. When the mother's sadism fails to defend her against what she experiences as her child's persecution, she is at risk of relying upon ruthless aggression or its psychic equivalent. The child's wellbeing is then no longer relevant to the mother. The mother's only concern is negating or eliminating any aspect of the child that poses a threat to her survival.",

      "abstract": "Complexity is a term that is often invoked by those writing appreciatively about the taste, aroma/bouquet, and/or flavor of food and drink. Typically, the term is used as though everyone knows what is being talked about. Rarely is any explanation given, and the discussion soon moves on to other topics. However, oftentimes it is not at all clear what, exactly, is being referred to. A number of possibilities are outlined here, including physical complexity at the level of individual molecules, at the level of combinations of molecules giving rise to a specific flavor profile (e.g., as in a glass of quality wine or a cup of specialty coffee), at the level of combinations of distinct ingredients/elements (e.g., as when composing a particularly intricate dish in a high-end restaurant, say, or when pairing food with wine), and/or the number of stimuli/steps involved in the process of creation. Of course, people might also be referring to some aspect of their perceptual experience, and one of the intriguing questions in this space concerns the nature of the relationship(s) between these different ways of conceptualizing complexity in the chemical senses. However, given that physical/chemical and perceived complexity so often diverge, we argue that it is the latter notion, or rather inferred complexity, that is the most relevant when it comes to the chemical senses. Finally, we look at the role of expertise and review the evidence suggesting that inferred complexity can emerge either from a unitary taste experience that is judged to be complex, or from a tasting experience having multiple individuable elements.",

      "abstract": "In the liberal Enlightenment tradition, art-making is understood as a creative, non-instrumental endeavour. It is a pursuit that enables individuals to realise their ideas and desires within the circumscribed space of the imagination, and to find surcease from the affective and practical demands of family, community and nation. The object of art – the work of art – is then the product and sign of that apparently free, expressive behaviour, and the material record of an active, purposeful human consciousness. The activity of labour, on the other hand, is understood as an instrumental activity, the goal of which is the production or acquisition of commodities or property, or the obtaining of a quantity of money sufficient to purchase the necessities (or luxuries) of life. It is also understood as an activity that may be legitimately alienated, that is, given, lent or sold to someone else for their benefit or profit. Finally, labour is thought of as a human activity that – apart from its material rewards – is irksome, routine, onerous or otherwise undesired by those that perform it. Labour according to this view, though the lot of human kind, is extrinsic to our particular, minds, bodies and natures. Thus art and labour, in the liberal Enlightenment tradition, are seen as essentially opposed.",

      "title": "Scrupulousness and a HinduJain contact",
      "abstract": "Scrupulousness is associated, where it occurs spontaneously, with certain personality-types, and with certain neurotic conditions. A scrupulous person is somewhat difficult to live with. Where it is a cultural constant, and is observed in and by a whole mass of indiscriminate humanity, it is another phenomenon. The Jewish civilization is familar with the double standard. There is the norm, to which everyone should conform: and there are two extremes, that of the Men of Sodom, who are the dogs in the manger, who will never do the righteous thing even if it costs them nothing, and, on the other hand, the ḥasidm , who are scrupulous. The double standard implies that there are persons, and groups who are voluntarily associated, who choose to be more careful than the average, and though their scrupulosity does not impugn the righteousness of the average, it provides some kind of control upon it, and vice versa. Even the average are exhorted in the Mishnah to build a fence about the Law. This is a normative principle of Pharisaic origin, to the effect that one should so conduct oneself as never to place oneself within reach of breaking the negative commandments. This is scrupulosity, and the difference between the average observant Jew and the Hasid is (in this respect) that the Hasid will pursue the principle, if need be, to his own cost. A good example of the Mishnaic principle in general practice was the 39 stripes: a man was flogged 39 times, so as not to infringe the biblical precept of 40 lashes: one kept just within the margin of the Law.",

The actual individual is seldom reconstructed for the purposes of the internist; personality is a category that he does not use. So far as the study of personal factors is omitted, the study of the functions of the individual organs is incomplete. Not only does each organ have its definite routine task in relation to the domestic economy; it is also liable at any time to be commandeered for foreign service, when the individual has to react to an external situation of biologic importance.

No other animal passes so large a portion of its existence in a state of absolute helplessness, or falls in old age into such protracted and lamentable imbecility. To no other warm-blooded animal has nature denied that indispensable covering without which the vicissitudes of a temperate and the rigours of a cold climate are equally insupportable; and to scarcely any has she been so sparing in external weapons, whether for attack or defence. Destitute alike of speed to avoid and of arms to repel the aggressions of his voracious foes; tenderly susceptible of atmospheric influences; and unfitted for the coarse aliments which the earth affords spontaneously during at least two thirds of the year, even in temperate climates, — man, if abandoned to mere instinct, would be of all creatures the most destitute and miserable.",

Aggressive behaviour among peers seems to be established at this age and it is interesting to observe it within the Peer-groups. 2. A useful definition of aggression seems to be the following one: Aggression is any physical contact, direct or indirect, by which another person is hurt. 3. We observe five different forms of aggression: 3.1 Aggression by chance, without any aim, happening out of awkwardness and motoric clumsiness. This kind of aggression becomes rarer during the second year. 3.2 Manipulating one another, as shaking arm or leg of another child, pulling his hair, tapping his body and so on, giving the impression of the aggressor exploring his partner. This kind of aggression also becomes rarer during the second year. 3.3 Robbery of objects, i.e. toys being in the hands of another; the reaction of the victim is increasing during the second year. 3.4 Aggression in order to control the group and to establish leadership in connection with the development of a group hierarchy. 3.5 Pathologic Aggression, observed on a child of the group with brain dysfunction. The child overthrows others from behind, climbs on them and bites them in the ear, the neck or the cheek. 4. We still need more observation on Peer-groups of this age to know more about the beginning and development of the here described phenomena.",

      "abstract": "The fields of philosophical anthropology and the ethics of personalism overlap in the area of many difficult personal situations involving clinical toxicology. These therapeutic situations need an integral, multidimensional, and personal approach for both the patient and the toxicologist. This means that man is treated not only as a physical (biological) being but also there is an appreciation for the mental sphere, which includes rational, emotional, and spiritual elements while not forgetting that the human person is also part of the human community. Studying such an individual's personal decision as suicide, we must realize that it's not just physiological or biochemical poisons but also includes the poisoning of the psyche, as well as poisoning relationships with loved ones (family), poisoning social relations (in school or the workplace) and poisoning the spirit, in other words, there is no meaning in life itself, nor the meaning of God's existence, nor the meaning of faith, hope and love. Not only is there a greater \"variety of poisons\" than before, they are much more extensive and deep. For example, we can name environmental pollution, industrial poisons, chemical waste, genetic modification, powerful medications, or even the toxic social environment of evil ideas, malicious manipulation of the human mind (destructive religious sects). In approaching the challenges of clinical toxicology, the doctor must not only be a specialist in chemistry, biochemistry and pharmacology. What then is of future of toxicology because of this human dimension (anthropological, ethical and spiritual) of this teaching? As today marks the occasion of the 45th anniversary of the Clinic of Toxicology CM UJ, should we shape the ethos of young doctors who want to deal with toxicology seriously?",

In psychoanalytic practice, analysts encounter a variety of patients who operate at different levels of anxiety or desire in regards to their objects. Some patients who exhibit control and conviction about self and object demonstrate borderline and narcissistic disorders that revolve around more persecutory phantasies. There are also patients who face a constant depressive and persecutory threat to themselves and their precious objects. They rely heavily upon idealization and projective identification to traverse their psychological standoff against these overwhelming anxieties. The subsequent defenses that are always in overuse to sustain the brittle ideal self or object and to prevent the aggressive, envious self from breaking through actually cause either the death/damage of the object or the rise of a persecutory object. Often it can be both, creating a dual fear and phantasy of loss and persecution.",

He stops at nothing in order to try to satisfy his raging impulses. No action, or word, that comes from such a person should be seen as a surprise. \r\nThe Prophet (pbuh) thus said that if the son of Adam possessed two valleys of gold, he would long for a third one; “and nothing would fill (satiate) the stomach – or the mouth -- of the son of Adam but dust (that is, after he dies)” (Sahih Muslim).\r\nMan can easily become a world of paradoxes. Under the pressure of his recurring misjudgments, his inborn disposition and a myriad of external factors and forces, man can easily give in to the advances of his perennial anxieties, unfounded optimism and profligacy, relegating the transcendent power of his reason (intellect or ‘aql), as well as his primordial nature (instinct or fitrah), to the backseat. One moment he can think and act like an angel; the next he can be like a devil. \r\nThe similar thing Satan (Iblis) had in mind when he plotted to deceive Adam and his wife Eve (Hawa) and drive them out from the Garden of Eden. He whispered to them, coaxing them: “Shall I lead you to the Tree of Eternity and to a kingdom that never decays?” (Ta Ha, 120).",

      "title": "Altruism in behavioural, motivational and evolutionary sense",
      "abstract": "This paper discusses the relations between three forms of altruism: behavioural, evolutionary and motivational. Altruism in a behavioural sense is an act that benefits another person. It can range from volunteering to a charity and helping a neighbour, to giving money to a non-profit organisation or donating blood. People often dedicate their material and nonmaterial resources for the benefit of others to gain psychological, social and material benefits for themselves. Thus, their altruistic acts are driven by egoistic motivation. Also, the final goal of an altruistic act may be the increase in the welfare of a group or adherence to a certain moral principle or a social norm. However, at least sometimes, the welfare of others is the ultimate goal of our actions, when our altruistic acts are performed from altruistic motivation. In evolutionary sense, altruism means the sacrifice of reproductive success for the benefit of other organisms. According to evolutionary theories, behaviour which promotes the reproductive success of the receiver at the cost of the actor is favoured by natural selection, because it is either beneficial for the altruist in the long run, or for his genes, or for the group he belongs to. However, altruism among people emerges as a distinctly human combination of innate and learned behaviours. Not only do we benefit the members of our own group, but we are capable of transcending our tribalistic instincts and putting the benefit of strangers at our own personal expense as our ultimate goal.",

      "abstract": "In ‘Virtue and Character’ A. D. M. Walker claims that kindness and justice are incompatible in certain important ways and that a person can be kind or just without possessing the other virtue. Walker argues that virtues must lead to ‘effective and intelligent action’ and that a virtue ceases to exist if ‘it leads to violation of the minimal requirements of any other virtue’. On this view kindness and justice function independently to produce effective action. Kindness requires a direct caring for the individual in particular circumstances, while justice involves a commitment to impartiality that abstracts from an individual's situation. Walker argues that, as long as the minimal requirements of other virtues are met, one can be kind without weighing considerations of justice. He cites with approval kind behaviour which human beings learn as young children. Such behaviour may be a deeply engrained personality trait, and the individual passing through different situations in life may have no need to consider questions of justice. ‘He will merely need to be able to recognize and respond to certain types of considerations as overriding the values promoted by kindness’.",

It is a tendency against which, in the interests of true psychology, a timely protest may well be made; for its interests cannot in the end be served by pretensions to a knowledge which it is far from possessing and by unwarrantable claims to authority based upon such pretensions. If all criminals are, as the theory postulates, of defective or diseased mental organization, we must needs go on to acknowledge that few, if any, persons are well formed or sound mentally. Every Christian who listens reverently to the reading of the Ten Commandments and prays devoutly that God will incline his heart to keep them, feels, or ought to feel if he be in earnest, that he has in him the potentiality of committing every crime or sin forbidden by them. That he does not commit a particular crime which another person does is not owing always to a stronger and better nature in him, nor to an opportune infusion of prevenient grace, but to the absence of the adequate temptation in the circumstances of his life and calling. Time and the occasion count for much in the production of crime, as in the production of other human events; and it is quite possible that behind the crime of one who succumbs to an overwhelming temptation there may sometimes lie more merit than in the open virtue of another who has never been greatly tempted.",

      "abstract": "This research develops Presence Stickers, the capacitive sensing module that can be easily affixed to the existing space element surfaces (such as a wall, door, stairs), and daily objects or home furniture (such as a chair, cabinet, table, sofa, etc.).These 30*30 cm Presence Stickers can actively sense people's physical behaviors and body movements in spaces.From the preliminary analysis of observing the 80-year-old elderly subject's daily activities, the movement trajectory of the 'Move-Stop' pattern is found.There will be a Touch (T) and Touchless (TL) relationship between the body and the space elements or objects.Furthermore, the touchless, or non-contact, intimate relationship can also be divided into two types: 1.The body that 'Passes by' (P) the spatial elements or objects, and 2. The body that 'Stays' (S) in front of the object and performs activities.These three types of the intimate relationship between bodies and objects, i.e., T, TL-P, and TL-S, were used as the main sensing conditions to develop the Presence Stickers sensor module.We affixed 8 Presence Stickers on 9 objects in six spaces and finally, the life pattern can be analyzed and the sensors provide the customized intelligent application function for the elderly.",

      "title": "Eminent Otherness: Toward an Economy of Hospitality",
      "abstract": "This paper engages the question of economic hospitalityHospitality , of a radical welcoming of all that is other than ourselves into an economy, a home in which we dwell. The sense of welcoming here, adapted in a simplified way from Emmanuel Levinas[aut]Levinas, Emmanuel , is grounded in a pre-ontological, pre-existential, pre-ethical, pre-social and pre-linguistic absolute regard for the \"Other,\" persons or otherwise. The essay is best understood as a critical exercise in something like a radical and hermeneutic displacement of the most common philosophical and moral protocols of modern economics. Those protocols have to do with the priority of an assumed self, armed with \"self-interests\" and the power to transform life in the name of those interests in a competitive and strategic world. Otherness, in this scheme, is thus rendered instrumental. Everything other than the self is either possessed in the name of the self or ignored; and, more extremely, is valued only in terms of what's in it for the self. That which has nothing \"for me\" is not welcome. I sense that this posture is at the core of our contemporary economic problems, and I believe that we will make little progress in dealing with those problems unless and until we embrace an alternative axiology to the one described above. I offer one idea—a radical and unwilled hospitality—to help us move into a better place, a place of living well and doing well. That sort of hospitality is a necessary moral-ontological precursor to communities of solidarity and social harmony. I offer this as a thought experiment, hospitality as one idea among many others which make up an \"economic imaginary\" of how we might live more justly, more peacefully, as economic beings. Thought experiments are among the more potent practical acts available to us—democracy, human rights and freedoms, the abolition of slavery and on and on could not have tilled the practical soil without the ideas of those who first announced them. Bold ideas, ideas that the powers-that-be have always deemed silly and impractical, do in fact make different modes of life possible. Those modes begin with a willingness to entertain a very simple request—\"try thinking about it this way.\"",

      "title": "Teatralidad en casa: la arquitectura doméstica y la diva",
      "abstract": "La diva o el divo es una persona publica, un sujeto cuya artistica condicion laboral lo convierte en un ciudadano diferente. La diva no es ni masculina ni femenina, es un hombre, una mujer; todo un personaje cuya personalidad publica se confunde y se funde con sus ser privado. La diva, en terminos arquitectonicos, no presupone una profesion concreta o un genero definido. Se incluyen todas aquellas personas que por su trayectoria y estatus esten envueltas en un halo de excepcionalidad, ficticio o no, merecido o no, que los lleva a esta categoria. Una diva como cliente es otro tipo de sujeto, que no incorpora necesariamente las expectativas y normas tradicionales sobre los papeles dentro del ambito domestico. La diva es aquel o aquella cuyo trabajo es ser otro, interpretando o asumiendo a otros, como los actores o los cantantes de opera, o incluso auto-interpretandose, como en el caso de otro tipo de celebridades. Ser diva es un estado psicologico. Los arquitectos de exito a veces son divos. Su actuacion, entonces, ha de ser siempre original y solo consideran adecuado un marco extraordinario. El estudio de sus viviendas o sus lugares de trabajo es revelador de una concepcion que entiende la casa como una prolongacion de su comportamiento. La tesis alcanza una serie de obras para ilustrar el conce`to de la casa de la diva, comenzando con la vivienda de la actriz Maria Guerrero, ubicada literalmente encima del teatro que en la actualidad lleva su nombre. A continuacion, tres casos permiten, a modo de introduccion, ver la metodologia empleada en la elaboracion de la tesis: las casas-estudios de la pareja diego Rivera y Frida Kahlo, la casa del matrimonio de Dolores del Rio y Cedric Gibbons y, finalmente, la casa de Billy Wilder. Son dos casos distintos a los ejemplos desarrollados con mayor profundidad en los cinco capitulos siguientes: son viviendas de matrimonios compuestos por dos divas. Por ultimo, la casa de Wilder permite el analisis del retrato hollywoodiense mas preciso de la diva, su vivienda y su contraparte en la vida del creador de este retrato. Todas las obras estudiadas, menos el ejemplo de la obra auto-construida por la Guerrero, emplean una arquitectura decididamente moderna dentro de su contexto historico. Manejan una arquitectura que cuestiona la definicion del hogar, la relacion entre espacio publico y espacio privado y reformula la composicion de la casa en su disposicion espacial. En el estudio de las casas ejemplares del as divas en los siguientes capitulos, el orden es cronologico y, salvo la primera, todas datan del siglo XX. La primera obra es el parisino Hotel Guimard, del arquitecto Claude-Nicolas Ledoux, construido en el siglo XVIII. Enlaza la investigacion con el origen de la arquitectura moderna, en el momento historico en que se codifico como disciplina. Las otras cuatro obras se analizan son: la casa para Josephine Baker de 1927 en Paris obra del arquitecto austriaco Adolf Loos; el atico para Charles de Beistegui en los Campos Eliseos de la misma ciudad, de 1930-1931 del suizo Le Corbusier; la casa para Josef Von Stemberg en Los Angeles, California en 1936 del tambien austriaco Richard Neutra y finalmente la Glass House disenada por Philip Johnson para Philip Johnson en New Canaan, Connecticut, construida en 1949. Estos cinco ejemplos siguen diferentes variantes de una arquitectura moderna, cada caso formula el concepto de un espacio domestico donde lo estrictamente privado deja de serlo, donde la cara publica del hogar toma un aspecto desproporcionado con las expectativas de la casa tradicional. Son cinco obras de arquitectos comprometidos con un concepto de modernidad, y permiten una lectura poliedrica que entrelaza una arquitectura que prima la representacion y no solo la funcion. Este analisis explicita la interrelacion entre la personalidad de la diva y la arquitectura dentro de un contexto sociologico y biografico, revelando tando sobre eltemperamento del ocupante como de la significacion de la construccion dentro de la obra del arquitecto. La construccion se nos muestra finalmente como una simbiosis entre personalidades, donde la teatralidad dinamiza y se convierte en signo del hogar.",

      "title": "The \"Either or\" and Its Effects on Education",
      "abstract": "One of the most significant characteristics which appears to have continually pervaded educational thought and practice is that of the 'either-or.' This is perhaps not surprising as new, or at least, relatively new ideas are invariably introduced as either a reaction against or as some kind of remedy for felt deficiencies in a prevailing mode of thought or action. The history of education is mile-stoned with dichotomous stances: traditional/progressive; closed/open classrooms; teacher-directed/learner-directed activity; art instruction/self-expression; and so on. Indeed this would seem to be a natural order of events as any inadequacies or deficiencies in the system are invariably seen through selectively exaggerated vision and to be attacked vehemently as one would a Quixotic windmill. The new idea, to be put forward subtly or more likely not so subtly, has almost of necessity to be overstated so that the very point at issue will not be missed or the conviction with which it is put forward underestimated. As everyone knows, educational systems are conservative by nature and resistant to change so that any new idea, if it is to take root, has to be distinctly and perhaps even dramatically different from that which it is intended to replace or counter. Educational innovators would not welcome the analogy yet much of what they do in proliferating their ideas would equate them with some of the most successful ad-men of our time. Reference is frequently made almost benignly and certainly resignedly to the 'pendulum of education' which, it would seem, inexorably swings back and forth as if educational thought and practice",

      "abstract": "Abstract Inasmuch as emotions are expressions of living beings and not abstractions (of real people rather than the reified beliefs and conventional wisdom that comprise the social order), feelings are generally synonymous with life not law, freedom not facticity. Hence, for Kuranko, wale (duty or work) is \"that which you have to do\", by contrast with desire, which is what you might want to do. To express one's feelings or speak one's mind without taking into account the feelings or thoughts of others, is frowned upon; but so too is slavish adherence to social norms. Accordingly, a viable social life consists in making emotionality serve rather than subvert the common weal, a matter of giving equal expression to freedom and restraint. For Kuranko, this involves a continual adjustment of the bush (associated with antinomian impulses) and the village (associated with law and order).",

The study focuses on another subject, almost overlooked by specialists, self-sufficiency (understood as the general tendency towards complacency of the great majority of people), on the one side, and the ratio between self-sufficiency and self-education, on the other side. Also, the study aims to prove that: a. without self-education we are condemned to self-sufficiency; b. Self-education is the antidote of self-sufficiency, it is what gives us (or by which we regain) our inner life, our spiritual noblesse, the access to the deep issues of humanity, through which we grow from the inside, organically and authentically.",

      "title": "The Economic Value of Water",
      "abstract": "In economics, the value of an item—including water—to a person is defined as the most of something else of value (typically money, but sometimes time) the person is willing to give up to obtain that item (willingness to pay) or the minimum compensation the person would want to receive in exchange for forgoing the item (willingness to accept). These are measures of gross value; they are in principle quantitative; and they are subjective and idiosyncratic to the individual and the circumstances. The economic value of an item is not measured by its price. It is likely to vary with the amount of the item and should not be taken as a constant. A core conceptual distinction is between use value and nonuse value. A person’s use value for an item is the value that she places on the item from motives connected with the use of the item by someone, whether her own use or that of someone else. Nonuse value is the value she places on an item from motives not directly connected with the use of that item by anybody in any tangible way. For example, a person may value water to drink (a use value), but he may also value having water remain in its natural state (a nonuse value). Consumptive uses are use values, but nonconsumptive uses can also be use values (e.g., swimming in a lake). Other conceptual distinctions include that between wet water and paper water (water that exists on paper but is not actually accessible or usable), and that between raw water alone versus water accompanied by the infrastructure necessary to store it and convey it so as to make it available for use.",

These behaviours give evidence to the explicit hypothesis of the other as distinct from the self, and also as the source of intentionalities and abilities (needs, desires, plans, rationality). From these meanings, listening implies thinking. We can then represent it either in terms of procedures (how to create, obtain, establish, maintain, optimize, show the accurate attitude) – these procedures then become techniques, tools or methods – or in terms of process (what do we feel through such psychic moves ?) The processes develop in a temporality which provides their slow elaboration and maturation in obeying a more biological than mechanical future, whereas the procedures are more elaborate, rational, technical, modelized and segmented, thus more spatialized. The former are ways of acting, the latter are ways of existing. Of course these forms of representation seem heterogeneous, translating very different ways of seeing the world and very different philosophies. They can even claim to be antagonistic, which roughly corresponds to the classical distinction between Homo faber and Homo sapiens. The former is, at least partly, a matter for comprehension, in our acceptation of Dilthey’s terms, whereas the latter is a matter for explanation. The subtle intelligibility of the notion of listening is linked to the distinction between, as well as the contrasted articulation of the two heterogeneous readings.",

There are, of course, reasons other than religion – love and money, to take but two obvious examples – that lead people to do things that they would not otherwise have done, but religion would seem to add that extra something (for good or evil) that can inspire people to believe and act with an added fervour, an extra commitment, and an extra disregard for other consider­ations. If we really believe that it is God who wants us to do something then we are more likely to do it (or at least feel more guilty if we do not do it) than if George or Tony or even our guru asks us to do it – unless we believe that our guru is God, or is the only one with a direct hotline to Him (or Her).

      "abstract": "Human being is not perfect by nature so he is also not perfect in his desires and decisions. Human being has a priority in each decision in his favor. In such priorities, human being commits harm and cause loss to others to accomplish the desires and dreams to be true. By doing so, he commits such acts due to intention, negligence or unintentional acts which cause loss to others. Such acts, sometimes, amount to the loss of life of other person. The act done with full consciousness intention and preparation, then it is called Amd in Islamic jurisprudent and Shariah and other acts; done unintentional, are called Khata or Bis-sabab (unintentional act or by reasons of something else). In either cases; intentional or unintentional acts, the loss should be compensated. Islam has formulated such rules derived from the Holy Quran and Sunnah of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him). In case of loss of life, limb or loss of effective activity of a limb or more (injuries to human body), the Shariah has ordained rules which include Qisas (retribution), Diyat( blood money) and AFW (forgiveness by victim or heirs of victim). These rules are exceptions to general rules and are blessings of Allah (SWT) as mentioned in the Holy Quran that : O ye who believe! The law of equality is prescribed to you in cases of murder the free for the free, the slave for the slave, the woman for the woman. But if any remission is made by the brother of the slain, then grant any reasonable demand and compensate him with handsome gratitude, this is a concession and a mercy from your Lord. After this whoever exceeds the limits shall be in grave penalty . It is because of the previous nations as Bani Israil (Jews) and Nasara (Christians) were not bestowed such remissions simultaneously in case of offence of injuries and murders. Bani Israil (Jews) were ordered Qisas only but no Diyat or Afw whereas Nasara (Christians) were given permission of Afw only but no Qisas or Diyat. As compared to them Muslims were given three possibilities in case of loss of others so that the enmity and grudge may be settled down between parties amicably or by way of Qisas . These rules have been proved to be a source of stability in the Muslim society. Qisas and Diyat laws introduced in Pakistani legal system and certain amendments were introduced in the penal and procedural laws and rules were framed for the said purpose. The Islamic concept of security to the human being is far lasting and is secured in each and every manner. Concept of Aqilahh is one of those securities provided in Islamic law. The loss of human being should not go vain in any manner whatsoever.",

Many moral philosophers, unfortunately, seem to agree with them, to the extent, at any rate, of taking it for granted that there is some one divison of actions into two classes, which division is of some especial or even unique significance. Actions, they have supposed, are either right or wrong. If they are right, then they must and ought to be done, and to do them is our duty. If they are wrong, then they must not and ought not to be done, and it is our duty not to do them. If we do what is right, and do this because it is right, and not just because it suits us, then we have performed a morally good action, and we deserve praise or commendation. If we have done something which is wrong, then we have performed a morally bad action, and deserveblame, and possibly punishment. Finally, a man manifests his moral goodness by performing, from a sense of duty, those actions which belong to the first class, and omitting those which belong to the second class; since there are no other ways in which actions may be classified morally, he has ample oppo tunity for exercising his talents, and the morally good man, or the conscientious man, or the dutiful man, becomes the archetype of what a man ought to be.",

      "abstract": "T F at some time a person's conduct can make -* the whole difference between probability = 0 and probability = 1 for the obtaining of some state of affairs S, then his conduct is relevant to (the obtaining of) S; or, as I shall sometimes say for short, he is relevant to S. One can also be rele? vant to S through affecting its probability less drastically than that. Everything I say here can take in that territory as well, but it is helpful to think mainly in terms of all-or-nothing relevance. A state of affairs may obtain (1) because some? body did such and such, or (2) because he did not do so and so. For example, the gate at the railway crossing was open (1) because he opened it, or (2) because he didn't close it. (2) doesn't apply unless he could have closed it: the Emperor of Japan didn't open the gate and couldn't have closed it, and so his conduct was not relevant at all to its being open. But I don't confine (2) to people who ought to have prevented S, or who had some duty or obligation to prevent it, or anything like that. I take someone's conduct to be negatively relevant to the gate's being open just so long as he could have closed it and didn't. That makes each of us negatively relevant to millions of states of affairs. But why not? I have been told: is not useful to make the notion of as weak as that. We should at least build into it that the person knew he could prevent S from obtaining. But if we do, we'll make some important truths harder to say, and thus harder to see. If I didn't know that I could have closed the gate, that may excuse me; and if I didn't know I was opening it, that may excuse me. It won't be easy to compare those two excuses if we work with a concept of ac? cording to which a person is not negatively rele? vant to S unless he does know what his conduct is leading to. It may be objected that the ignorance excuse falls very unevenly across the positive/neg? ative divide, being available a million times on the side for every one on the positive. But that doesn't mean that comparisons are not worth making; and in any case, you can't even state that objection without using negative relevance in my way. If we refuse to call someone's conduct negatively relevant to S unless he knew that he could make the difference to whether S obtained or not, we shall be definitionally abolishing the ex? cuse He was negatively relevant, but he didn't know, stamping into the ground an interesting and perhaps important difference between the two sorts of relevance. Similarly for the suggestion that we shouldn't call someone negatively relevant to S's obtaining unless it was his job to prevent it. We ought to be able to compare how the plea was not his spe? cial responsibility works on the side of the line with how it works on the positive side; but for that we need a concept of which allows the plea to arise on that side of the line.",

This is the person who in an imperfect way actually emerges from the experience of safety and freedom in a therapeutic experience, and this is the person whom I have tried to describe for you in “pure” form. My purpose has not been to convince you of the correctness of this view. Indeed I would have to confess that I have written this paper primarily for my own satisfaction, to clarify the thoughts which have been stirring in me. But if this presentation causes you to formulate your view of the person who emerges from therapy, or enables you to point out flaws in my own thinking which I have not yet seen, or arouses in you the desire to put to objective test either this picture or one which you paint for yourself, then it will have fully served both its primary and its secondary purpose.",

      "title": "THE PROBLEM OF COMMUNICATION",
      "abstract": "The terms in which this essay is written, and the examples used to illustrate various points, are for the most part not specifically Catholic. One reason for this is a desire to present the problem in the idiom of the world with which Catholics want, or should want, to communicate, since they exist partly for its sake. It looks as though the most primitive forms of communication were non-conscious and non-voluntary. Investigators working on animal communications as they are found in such creatures as sticklebacks, and even in more highly developed beasts like ducks, believe the evidence warrants their assuming that both stimulus and response as shown, for instance in patterns of aggression or mating behaviour, are almost automatic. Investigators conditioned by methods of modem scientific research are of course prone to believe in automatism, since it is a concept which makes their task of abstraction and generalization very much easier than would ideas of spontaneity and of feeling: and the outside observer may conclude that they are tempted to minimize the influence of factors they cannot measure and even sometimes to deny that they exist. It is incidentally fascinating to notice how, when they extend to human behaviour the methods and presuppositions of their earlier work, they seem to rationalize the belief that when man fell he fell away from the glorious liberty of the children of God into an animal automatism; an automatism which, since he is not wholly an animal, set him under the domination of the idea of mechanism and of the machines his brain created, from prayer-wheels to electronic brains and a concept of the State based on the image of a robot Leviathan.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Although reason and rationality are valuable assets in almost all contexts, in some cases people are better off putting reason aside. In a number of very important situations, people benefit by not seeing the world as it is and by not behaving like logic-driven machines. Sometimes they know they aren’t making sense, and yet they are compelled to act against reason; in other cases, their delusions are so much a part of normal human experience that they are unaware of them. As intelligent as they are, much of what has helped humans succeed as a species is not prodigious brain power but something much more basic. The Uses of Delusion is about aspects of human nature that are not altogether rational but, nonetheless, help humans achieve social and personal goals. This book presents a lively, accessible exploration, fleshing out how delusional thinking plays a role in personal achievement, love and relationships, illness and loss, and personality and behavior. The Uses of Delusion draws on the work of William James and Daniel Kahneman, as well as Joan Didion, who wrote about her compelling belief that her husband, though deceased, would soon return to her. The book is grounded in current views of rational and irrational behavior and illustrates how natural selection has provided humans with a number of beneficial delusions that help them get to the next day.",

In primitive communities, when holding together and wrestling with a combined effort against natural adversities or rival tribes, each individual acquires a homogeneous basis of habits in doing and thinking which become irrefutable matters of course.--In case of economical surplus consolidation of bigger social units gets under way.--That leads step by step--starting always from pioneering élites--in the course of many generations to increasing awareness in the conduct of life and at the same time to dwindling of the emotionally fixed matters of course. In the final stage of evolution, therefore, everyone should consequently acquire for himself a framework of habits and attitudes, representing a compromise between selfish and altruistic tendencies and granting his thoughts and actions steadiness, assurance, and self-confidence.--If, however, owing to affluence, adverse living conditions do not force joint exertions and concord, individualistic expansion, competition, and rivalry arise and undermine the human relations. As a result increasingly self-realization is claimed to the debit of the fellow-men. But in view of the fact that the individual as a gregarious being cannot exist without trustworthy social ties and esteem, a rising number of men comes into a conflict between individualistic desire for expansion and yearning for the security of a community. Exposed to such a situation a lot of people are unable to adjust to a harmonious living together.",

However, it appears no less important than positive emotions, positive traits, and positive institutions. Unlike positive emotions, it is always synergetic: It brings benefits not only to the developing person, but also to other persons surrounding him or her. Unlike positive traits, it is something a person cannot reach, but rather must cultivate all the time with incessant efforts. Unlike positive institutions, it is something for which a person can take full responsibility. What Seligman calls the Nikki principle—”by identifying, amplifying, and concentrating on these strengths in people at risk we will do effective prevention” (Seligman, 2002b, p. 5)—is not so much about the strengths themselves, but rather about the process of their actualization.",

While agents may be passive in an important sense when acting spontaneously, they are not thereby necessarily victims of forces acting upon them (from either “outside” or “inside” their own bodies and minds). The central claim of this chapter is that spontaneous actions can be, in central cases, “attributable” to agents, by which I mean that they reflect upon the character of those agents. This claim is made on the basis of a care-based theory of attributability. Attributability licenses (in principle) what some theorists call “aretaic” appraisals.

Beside changes of external fortune (victory, poverty, freedom, power, etc.), man is subject to changes in his own person, different states of body and mind. The narrow band is more fitted to inescapable outward fortune or to hampering of body or mind, the wide band or cloak, wrapping, to more pervasive states of body or mind. When a man's hands are stricken with weakness, or his limbs are paralysed, they are ‘bound’ by a god; he who is deluded in mind is ‘bound’ with ἄτη or ἐλπίς. On the other hand he puts on, clothes himself or is clothed with, steadfastness, energy, shamelessness, etc. (δύσεο δʾ ἀλκήν, κρατερὸν μένος ἀμϕιβαλόντες, ἀναιδείην ἐπιειμένος, etc.).

Without the certainties of the past, how could one know what a proper life looked like? How was one to live? What was one to do? In a manner akin to the modern Jew responding to the prevailing trends in Western philosophy by rejecting the demand that the particular yield before the universal, contemporary virtue ethics is an approach to the ethical life that considers the dominant ethical theories of modernity and responds, in effect, “these are not enough. These do not understand the depth of the moral life and they are powerless to answer how to live a morally rich life.” Where the modern Jew negotiated a way of maintaining particularity while participating in the universal, the virtue ethicist attempts to find a way to respond to the demands that ethics be somehow universally applicable while recognizing the essential embeddedness of the virtues and ethics themselves. Virtue ethics, which demands that we consider the question of how one should live before we attempt to evaluate the morality of a given action or attempt to choose how to act when facing a moral dilemma, draws our attention to the rupture in the moral certainties at the point when Jewish tradition encounters modernity.",

      "title": "The Values of Life",
      "abstract": "In Life's Dominion Dworkin aims at defusing the controversy about abortion and euthanasia by redefining its terms. Basically it is not a dispute about the right to life, but about its value. Liberals should grant that human life has not only a personal, but also an intrinsic value; conservatives should accept the principle of toleration which requires to let people decide for themselves about matters of intrinsic value. Dworkin fails, however, to distinguish between two kinds of personal value: (1) the value of something to a person, when he actually or dispositionally desires it, or finds it pleasant; and (2) the value of something to a person, when it's objectively contributes to his well-being, as defined by reference to his personal point of view, whether or not he ever perceives it as so contributing. He also fails to distinguish between two meanings of the concept of 'intrinsic value': (3) ultimate, i.e. non-instrumental personal value of kind (2); (4) the impersonal value of something which is not good-for-anybody, but simply good, i.e. not a constituent of someone's well-being. Dworkin argues that the human fetus from conception onwards has a value, that it is not a personal value of kind (1), and therefore must be an intrinsic value. But the value of the life of the fetus is not a personal value of kind (2) either and therefore not an intrinsic value of kind (3): it is normally a constituent of the well-being of the pregnant woman, but that doesn't constitute its value, and it is not good 'for' the fetus itself in the relevant sense, because it doesn't have a personal point of view. If, however, the fetus' life is allowed to have an intrinsic value of kind (4), the conservative cannot be refuted by appeal to the principle of toleration, for this only concerns intrinsic value of kind (3). The liberal, indeed, should recognize that the fetus' life has a value, but it is neither a personal value (1) or (2), nor an impersonal value (4), but rather a relational value which gradually develops from some point substantially later than conception.",

Valdemar' (1845) a swollen, blackened tongue speaks from beyond the grave.Bodies dissolve: released from mesmeric stasis, M. Valdemar rapidly decomposes into a putrid 'liquid mass' (Poe 1986: 359).Arthur Machen's 'The Novel of the White Powder' (1895) ends with a body, 'neither liquid nor solid', oozing and bubbling in terminal dissolution (Machen 1977: 233).Even buildings defy the laws of nature, crashing in ruins without identifi able cause, manifesting strange animations on and in walls, or contravening the laws of physics (Walpole",

Working through and with our current social roles we forge new projects and engage new commitments with new (to us) sets of norms and values. Sometimes our decisions are transformative; sometimes they usher in entirely new (to us) norms and values. The externalist artisanal model has better resources to explain normative self-creation than does internalism. In particular I argue that Afunction externalism provides a solution to the paradox of self-creation—that is, the idea that self-creation is a process guided by values that we do not yet possess—and familiar forms of internalism lack the resources to disarm the paradox. The artisanal model offers an external location for the goods and norms that are the objects of aspiration for the apprentice.",

Corresponding to these highly aggressive meanings, philobatic people are usually imagined as robust, upstanding, conquering heroes, enjoying their independence, unflinchingly facing dangers, and defiantly going their own way. Auto-erotic activities, in fact all sexual activities as well as thrills, have a good deal in common. The grammatical forms—middle voice, reflexive or intransitive forms—are also used for the expression of another most important relationship, the field of auto-erotic activities, from scratching to masturbation. It has long been known that over-indulgently brought up children masturbate on the whole much more intensely than the average child. If the environment is greatly indifferent right from the start and the neglected child hardly ever experiences loving human contact, both his object relationships and his auto-erotic activities will become stunted, as was clearly demonstrated by R.

      "title": "Figures of Evil in the Business World",
      "abstract": "When you ask people What is evil?, their responses are striking in several respects. They tend to name individuals, singling out certain people as evil?e.g., Adolf Hitler, Saddam Hussein, or Joseph Stalin. They typically view evil as inhering in people or in quasi-personal agents (e.g., devils or vampires), not in animals or natural forces. Respondents never describe themselves as evil or as in any way complicitous in evil deeds. A recent poll of Americans who regularly attend church estimated that only three percent believe that they are the ones who might go to hell.1 And they perceive evil as an active, creative, and even autonomous force at work in the world. This last response suggests that perhaps the popular imagination knows something that ethical theorists do not. Ethicists who study busi nesses and organizations typically attribute malevolence and cruelty on the part of businesspeople to either a failure of moral reasoning or to a complete lack of empathie imagination. Some ethical lapses do appear to be the result of individuals' failure to think; they operate on a kind of moral autopilot, following a script they have never thought to question. The pilots who, during the 1950s, routinely dumped fuel into the ocean prior to landing did not set out to harm the environment. They were simply following the landing procedures they had been taught by those pilots who were their teachers. If evil is identical with mindlessness, then the best way to combat it is to instill habits of mindfulness. Those of us who teach ethics try to do so by asking our students to consider cases with a view to determining where and why people went wrong. We look for revealing patterns and causes. We",

      "abstract": "Things get murkier with the attempt to “use narrative toward ethical ends” [2]. The relationship between understanding a patient’s illness experience and making ethical decisions about his or her care—without recourse to such other ethics approaches as principlism, casuistry, or virtue ethics—is neither obvious nor uncomplicated. Narrative ethics’ claim is that one can “gain ethical insight and wisdom directly from narratives and without appealing to rules, principles, or other ethical constructs” [2]. Aesop’s fables make a similar claim—the morals derive from the stories. If the grasshopper sings and dances all summer (while the ant is laying-in food), and he therefore starves in winter, a child unschooled in moral theory or principles can deduce that the grasshopper’s actions have brought him a certain sort of harm— death. (Unless, as in some revisionist versions of the story, the saintly ant pities the grasshopper and takes him in for the winter). But, just as with principlism and even virtue ethics, the trouble comes when the narratives (or principles or virtues) conflict. Listen to the grasshopper’s side of the story. The miserable little ant spends the glorious summer carrying crumbs as big as she is on her back—she can neither see the sun nor feel its warmth—all to sustain life in an uncomfortably cold mound during the winter waiting for the next summer’s drudgery to begin. (Aesop’s fabled insects lived multi-year lives.) “You call that living,” the grasshopper might declaim as he goes out in a blazing dance of defiance during the red and gold profusion of autumn. This all sounds quite silly, but can be deadly serious when the grasshopper is a 20-something motorcyclist who refuses leg",

      "abstract": "Religiously, God is the creator of everything seen and unseen; thus, one can ascribe to Him the names of His creation as well, at least in their primordial form. In the mentality of ancient Semitic peoples, naming a place or a person meant determining the role or fate of the named entity, as names were considered to be mysteriously connected with the reality they designated. Subsequently, God gave people the freedom to name persons, objects, and places. However, people carried out this act (precisely) in relation to the divinity, either by remaining devoted to the sacred or by growing estranged from it, an attitude that generated profane names. The sacred/profane dichotomy occurs in all the branches of onomastics, such as anthroponymy, toponymy, and ergonymy. It is circumscribed to complex and interdisciplinary analysis which does not rely on language sciences exclusively, but also on theology, ethnology, sociology, psychology, philosophy, anthropology, geography, history and other connected fields, as well as culture in general. Despite the contributors’ cultural diversity (29 researchers from 16 countries – England, Finland, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Japan, Jordan, Kenya, Nigeria, Poland, Romania, Russia, South Africa, Spain, U.S.A., and Zimbabwe – on four continents) and their adherence to different religions and faiths, the studies in Onomastics between Sacred and Profane share a common goal that consist of the analysis of names that reveal a person’s identity and behavior, or the existence, configuration and symbolic nature of a place or an object. One can state that names are tightly connected to the surrounding reality, be it profane or religious, in every geographical area and every historical period, and this phenomenon can still be observed today. The particularity of this book lies in the multicultural and multidisciplinary approach in theory and praxis.",

Thousands of people cooperating effectively, without price signals to offer 'incentives' or managerial hierarchy to direct efforts, was an impossibility. And yet, it moves. And as it moved it combined with a deep shift across many disciplines, from biology and neuroscience to organizational sociology, experimental economics, and social psychology to paint a very different view of who we are as human beings. Slowly pushing back against decades of ever-refined analyses based on self-interested rationality, we begin to see that we are diverse beings; that a majority of us responds cooperatively to cooperative settings--we tend to treat well those who have treated us well, rather than take advantage of them; we tend to do what we think is right and fair, when it is clear in the setting what that is; we experience empathy, and it makes us more generous and trustworthy; we experience solidarity with others, and that makes us contributed more willingly to the group's goals. Moreover, explicit payments, the touchstone of mechanism design under universal self-interested rationality, turns out to have a much more complex relationship with motivation than simple addition. All this work in basic behavioral sciences combines with observations from organizational sociology, political science, and management studies combines with social software to provide an increasingly better articulated basis on which to develop a field of cooperative human systems design.",

Herein the problem of the relationship between forms of ritual offering, sickness, sin, and the continual restructuring of ordered social relations is addressed. Since living persons (save rainmakers or prophets) cannot directly contact Divine Spirit, they must request the dead to do so. There is a clear action of identification by a rite of encirclement of the sacrifier's head or homestead or, in the case of a ceremony performed by a rainmaker, of the group's territory. In all these rites, there is the consecration of an offering by means either of words or the laying on of hands.",

      "title": "The Purpose of Personal Value",
      "abstract": "It seems as if there are things that have what we might call personal value—special objects, artwork by our children, etc. This term is meant to mark a difference between things whose value seems tied to a particular person, as opposed to things (like the Mona Lisa) that are valuable, period. The concept of personal value hasn’t received much focused attention, but I believe that it is of not only theoretical, but practical importance. In this paper, I explore the practical angle, arguing that personal value is important to our ability to make sense of ourselves. I give several desiderata for an account of personal value, and use examples to raise questions for Toni Ronnow-Rasmussen’s recent analysis of personal value. This practical stance leads me to offer an amendment to this analysis. It seems as though some things have what we might call personal value. That is, their value seems particularly tied to a specific person in a way that other valuable things are not. That is, the value of things like your favorite mug or your child’s scribbly drawing seems different from the value of the Mona Lisa and social justice. The former don’t have much (if any) value in the grand scheme of things, but the latter do. But we wouldn’t want to say that your favorite mug isn’t valuable; it might have quite a bit of value to you. This difference hasn’t received much concentrated attention in philosophical literature, but I think it is of not only theoretical, but practical interest. It is the practical angle I wish to explore in this paper. In particular, I want to argue that the purpose of a notion of personal value is to help us sort what is important to us from what is not—and that we need this concept in order to make sense of our lives. A sense of the practical significance of the notion should, then, shape an account of it, and at the end of the paper I offer some suggestions toward this end. To get directly to the point, I claim that the reason we need a notion of personal value is that impersonal value is pervasive and overwhelming and we can’t adequately respond to it all. One way to think of the problem that hoarders have is that they have difficulty letting things go because they not only recognize value in the most mundane objects, but also have an overdeveloped sense of responsibility to respond to that value—in particular, by possessing and keeping the objects. But hoarding is just an extreme case of clutter, which is (so I think) the result of a tendency most of us have: the tendency to appreciate value. This is a basic fact of life. Creatures as sophisticated as we are have cognitive and emotional capacities that are deeply intertwined, and which allow for a great deal of nuance in our perception, recognition, and 1 Cite Bennett Helm. 2 appreciation of value. We find value in things beyond those that satisfy our basic needs; we are uplifted by sunsets, we fight for freedom and justice, we care about other people. In this sense, we think that there are things that matter, period. This mattering doesn’t have to be grand; things can matter in minor ways, for instance by being useful for everyday life (as, for instance, can openers are). These things that matter have impersonal value, that is, value that is not specifically related to particular valuers, or that we value without reference to anything or anyone else. In addition to the many specific valuing attitudes, we are capable of a great many different actions in response to the recognition of value. For instance, considering just one example, recognition of the value of art can range from believing that art is a good thing, to visiting art museums, to collecting art, to lobbying for legislation to fund the National Endowment for the Arts. Given the enormous range of objects in the world (including abstract ones like justice), their manifold shades of significance, and the wide range of appropriate responses to this significance, the world should seem overwhelmingly full of value, much the way it is overwhelmingly full of light, color and noise to a newborn baby. But it doesn’t. Just as a baby learns to focus attention and differentiate objects from one another, we learn to focus our valuing and concentrate on just some of the value in the world, adopting it as our own. We take out a stake in it, so to speak. This attachment to some valuable things is what makes it possible to operate successfully in the world. So we can think of personal value as a kind of attention: it helps us to pick out of the “blooming, buzzing confusion” the things that matter most to us. This serves in contexts as concrete as clearing out the clutter in our living and working spaces, or as broad and abstract as the architecture of our personal lives, and on many levels in between. To begin to understand the idea of personal value, let’s look at a sample of things that seem, at least on the surface, to have it. My favorite example is my raggedy old stuffed pink rabbit Pete. He was my favorite toy when I was a child, and as a result his fur is worn off and his tail is hanging by a thread; surely no one who didn’t know me would find him valuable, and the only reason that those who do know me will value him is derived from my valuing him. He is something that has virtually no impersonal value, but a great deal of personal value. He has what we often term “sentimental” value. What else can have personal value? The laptop I’m using to write this has a great deal of personal value to me, but it is not at all like Pete’s sentimental value. This computer contains files that are important to me for both personal and professional reasons. Although my important files are backed up, the loss of this computer would be quite significant, because it is an important tool that I use nearly all the time. But unlike Pete, nothing hinges on its being this particular computer. I could, with reasonable ease, transfer all of the files that matter to me to another computer. Then that computer would take on the significance that this one has. What matters is that I have a computer, not that I have this computer. The photograph of stones under the rippling water of Lake Superior that hangs above our kitchen table also has personal value to me. There are a number of reasons for this, but the one I want to highlight has to do with the fact that I find it visually appealing. Again, unlike Pete, nothing",

      "abstract": "Abstract Our basic assumption is that children’s talk about the mind can reveal their conceptions of the mind. Specifically, we assume that at least some uses of terms such as think, know, and want can reveal the speaker’s understanding of beliefs and desires, core concepts in an everyday theory of mind. An example might be Mark’s statement above that “he thought there were haunted things in his house.” Of course, charting children’s concepts by examining their everyday language is not simple. On the one hand, children (and adults) may use terms like think, know, or want without any conception of, or reference to, beliefs and desires. For example, they might learn to say “Know what?” to gain a listener’s attention without any deeper understanding of notions such as knowledge or knowing. Or they might say “I don’t know” in a ritualistic way, as perhaps Ross does above. On the other hand, children might understand something of beliefs and desires but never talk about them. Or they might talk about such mental states but never use conventional terms like think and want. In these ways, among others, children’s language might underestimate or overestimate their understanding.",

But the concept of mental health defined free from the disorders those are prolonged and panic in nature. As the concept of mental health is subjective in nature, it varies from person to person. Besides free from the disorders, a person should pose some of the other positive characteristics to deal with the society effectively.

      "title": "The Development of Children’s Creativity",
      "abstract": "The idea of preconventional artwork suggests that preschoolaged children can be creative. Their creativity is, however, different from that of older children, adolescents, and adults. Preschool children do not produce works of art or solutions to problems that help and assist other people; their creativity is typically authentic self-expression. This self-expression is typically original-after all, it is preconventional-and fitting, at least given the child's own situation. What is most important is that even the things they do are not intended for wide audiences, young children do things that satisfy the two requirements of creativity: originality and usefulness. This is probably the most apparent in studies of young children's play. Schmukler (1985), for instance, emphasized children's play and imagination as bases for later creative skill. As she put it:Play [is] an activity which is not obviously goal-directed, such as recreating and acting out what the child has observed. Imaginative play refers to the introduction by the child of settings, times, and characters which are not immediately present in the environment and, since it makes something out of nothing, can be seen as creative expression with important developmental implications. (p. 75)Russ (1994), Ayman-Nolley (1992), and Smolucha (1992a, b), and Singer and Singer (in press) also tie the play of young children to creative potentials. Daugherty (1993) agreed that young children have creative potentials, but she felt these potentials were expressed in private speech. Matuga (2004) also saw creativity in the private speech of young children, as well as in their drawings.",

      "title": "Embodied Memory, Transcendence, and Telling: Recounting Trauma, Re-establishing the Self",
      "abstract": "Embodied Memory, Transcendence, and Telling: Recounting Trauma, Re-establishing the Self Roberta Culbertson (bio) Memory and Silence Naive public conceptions of memory, and the attendant assumption that memory takes certain forms and not others, contribute to a curious circumstance surrounding the victimized survivor of violence. The survivor most often, nearly invariably, becomes silent about his victimization, though the experience nevertheless in every case remains somehow fundamental to his existence, and to his unfolding or enfolded conception of himself. This silence is an internal one in which the victim attempts to suppress what is recalled (so as not to relive the victimization countless times), or finds it repressed by some part of himself which functions as a stranger, hiding self from the self’s experience according to unfathomable criteria and requirements. It is external as well: the victim does not tell what she recalls, in part because others do not seem to hear what is said, partly out of a conviction that she will not be believed, and more basically because she simply cannot make the leap to words: “If you were not there, it is difficult to describe or say how it was. It sounds very, very, very. . . . I don’t know if there is [a] word to describe the nightmare one go through . . . how men function under such a stress is one thing, and then how you communicate and express [to] somebody who never knew that such a degree of brutality [is] existing seems like a fantasy.” 1 Yet despite this silence, the momentous nature of threats and harm to the body dictates that violence and trauma nevertheless leave the survivor preoccupied with the memory of it, which itself seems both absent and entirely too present. Most disturbingly, bits of memory, flashing like clipped pieces of film held to the light, appear unbidden and in surprising ways, as if possessed of a life independent of will or consciousness. These undeniable presences nevertheless have an aura of unbelievability: though presenting themselves as clearly past, real, and fully embodied, they appear in nonnarrative forms that seem to meet no standard test for truth or comprehensibility. Survivor writings make it clear that to be a survivor of one’s violation [End Page 169] is precisely this: to live with the paradox of silence and the present but unreachable force of memory, and a concomitant need to tell what seems untellable. 2 The paradox is based in more than simply the difficulty of reporting events that listeners would rather not hear or believe, or which are too different to be grasped. It is the paradox of a known and felt truth that unfortunately obeys the logic of dreams rather than of speech and so seems as unreachable, as other, as these, and as difficult to communicate and interpret, even to oneself. It is a paradox of the distance of one’s own experience. No experience is more one’s own than harm to one’s own skin, but none is more locked within that skin, played out within it in actions other than words, in patterns of consciousness below the everyday and the constructions of language. Trapped there, the violation seems to continue in a reverberating present that belies the supposed linearity of time and the possibility of endings. It at once has a certain pastness, is a sort of “memory-knowledge” as Mary Warnock would call it, and is not past, not “memory”—that is, a personal, narrated account of something completed, locatable in time—at all. Perhaps it is not even remembered, but only felt as a presence, or perhaps it shapes current events according to its template, itself unrecognized. 3 The demands of narrative for their part operate in fact as cultural silencers to this sort of memory, descending immediately upon an experience to shape notions of legitimate memory, and silencing the sort of proto-memory described. We lose sight of the body’s own recall of its response to threat and pain, and of the ways in which it “speaks” this pain, because this wordless language is unintelligible to one whose body is not similarly affected, and because without words the experience has a certain shadowy quality, a paradoxical...",

      "abstract": "Extract Everyone is free to define \"ethics\" (\"morality\") as he pleases. Throughout history ethics (morality), like philosophy, has been conceived in a variety of ways. According to one conception, ethics is about moral obligation, moral responsibility, and moral oughts. In the introduction I refer to this way of conceiving ethics as the accountability project.1 Spinoza's moral philosophy does not belong to the accountability tradition. His moral philosophy is about living well in this life, and not about one's status in a system of moral credit and moral debt. There are ways we should care for ourselves and ways we should care for others. There is nothing in Spinoza's moral philosophy to suggest that we must make ourselves worthy or deserving of care. Nor does it suggest that we should make ourselves worthy or deserving of praise and rewards—praise and rewards that would serve as compensation for our hardships, suffering, and bad luck. There is no compensation for a life of sadness, hatred, and disempowerment. Spinoza does not ascribe a compensatory value to a person. A life marred with sadness and hatred is a life marred with sadness and hatred. It is as unfortunate as it is commonplace. There is no compensation for such a life. There are mentally and physically empowered people and empowered ways of life, and there are mentally and physically disempowered people and disempowered ways of life.",

      "abstract": "Chapter abstract The concept of habitus plays a central role in Bourdieu’s dispositional theory of action, itself part of his lifelong effort to develop a science of practice and a correlative critique of domination. Retracing the concept’s philosophical origins and its early uses by Bourdieu clears up four recurrent misunderstandings about the concept: first, habitus is never the replica of a single social structure, but a multilayered and dynamic set of schemata that records, stores, and prolongs the influence of diverse environments successively traversed during one’s existence; second, habitus is not necessarily coherent and unified, but displays varying degrees of integration and tension; third, habitus is no less suited to analyzing crisis and change than cohesion and perpetuation; fourth, habitus is not a self-sufficient mechanism for the generation of action—like a spring, it needs an external trigger—and cannot be considered in isolation from the social worlds in which it operates.",

The fundamental cause of the alienation is the modern view of world which still dominates the consciousness of modern people. In this paper, the possible ways of making happy old age through practice are investigated. Two kinds of aging through practice is discussed in this paper. The first is aging as practice through physical health problems. The second is aging as practice through social loss. In the first part, aging as practice through aging phenomenon, death, and disease is covered. In the second part, aging as practice through loss of social relation and economic loss is stated. In the next chapter, the image of beautiful old age is depicted. The heart of beautiful old age overflows with love. He thanks to everything and everybody. He is humble. He always stays in the lower place like water. His mind is peaceful. Nothing can disturb his peace. He is free from the obsession over money and power. His mind is receptive. He is open and can receive everything like earth. He helps everything which needs help. In this paper, aging as practice is discussed. The sociological and practical implication of this paper is as follows. First, the way of beautiful and happy aging can be suggested. Second, the image of happy and beautiful old age can be provided. These are very useful to solve the serious alienation of current old aged people.",

      "title": "Interpassivity",
      "abstract": "Interpassivity is a widespread, but mostly unacknowledged form of cultural behavior. It consists in letting others (other people, or animals, machines etc.) not work, but consume in one’s place. When certain people, for example, take care that others drink their beer for them, fotocopy or print texts out instead of reading them, let recording devices watch TV programmes in their place, use ritual machines that pray or believe for them vicariously, or are happy that certain TV-comedies already laugh about themselves, we have to speak of interpassivity. These actions are based on certain subjects’ preference to delegate their enjoyment instead of having it themselves. This, obviously, raises a number of quite uncanny, fundamental questions: Why do certain people do not want to have their enjoyment? And why do they, if the do not want to enjoy, go to such great pains in order to ensure that somebody else enjoys in their place? The theory of interpassivity has had considerable impacts on several disciplines such as philosophy, art theory, psychoanalysis, media theory, political theory, anthropology, theory of religion etc. This volume assembles essays that reach from the fundamental philosophical questions, concerning the paradoxical pleasure gained from delegated enjoyment, to their most current consequences: for example concerning interactivity and participation in the arts and in politics, generosity in culture, the status of belief, ritual and magic, cultural capitalism, civilized urban role-play etc.",

Mead goes further to argue that, not only are persons thus aware of their identities in others' eyes, but that they see their own identities as they perceive these others to see them: The individual experiences himself as such, not directly, but only indirectly, from the particular standpoints of other individual members of the same social group, or from the generalized standpoint of the social group as a whole to which he belongs. For he enters his own experience as a self or individual, not directly or immediately, not by becoming a subject to himself, but only insofar as he first becomes an object to himself just as other individuals are objects to him or in his experience; and he becomes an object to himself only by taking the attitudes of other individuals toward himself within a social environment or context of experience and behavior in which both he and they are involved (Mead, 1934:138). Self-Evaluation There have been a number of attempts to apply Mead's orientation to an understanding of the social process within which self-evaluations arise. The difficulty in making this application may lie in the problem of applying the open awareness assumption to the field of self-evaluations. When the social origins of personal identity or conception of the Who Am I? variety are being sought, the hypothesis that the person adopts the views of others toward himself as his own view of himself is not easy to challenge. Role-playing to audiences clearly generates identities that match the roles played.' But the idea I am a woman, and the idea I am a beautiful woman, are different in the sense",

      "abstract": "The number of notions of health is not infinite. In the history of medicine we can only find a number of different conceptions or paradigmatic ideas of health, in a variety of references and combinations. Health was seen as: 1. harmonious balance between principles or entities, 2. result of a struggle against opposing forces, 3. continuous dialectical process, 4. hierarchy of components or functions, 5. potential to perform and to develop, 6. transcendence towards higher levels of being, 7. result of conscious autonomous action, 8. optimal causal functioning, or 9. public task and responsibility. Hahnemann’s view of health, as reflected in his writings, utilized virtually all of these elements. They reappear for instance as: 1. harmonious tuning of the life force, 2. defeat of pathogenetic influences, 3. admittance of aggravations, 4. autocracy of the spirit-like life principle, 5. reference to a higher goal of human existence, 6. perfecting character of medical service, 7. concern about dietetics and life style, 8. utilization of causality and natural science, and 9. appealing to governmental provisions and medical police. These paradigms have been repeatedly recombined and applied. The theory of medicine is the attempt to analyze, adjust, and develop concepts that meet the demand of contemporary medical practice. Medical theory lies between the fields of observable facts and metaphysical convictions. Distinguishing the levels of practice, theory, and metaphysics could allow the open discussion of theoretical issues, such as the concept of health or disease, without raising purely theoretical objections to well-established practice.",

He does not relate his occupation with the occupations of his fellow–workmen, or even with the purpose of erecting buildings. If such a man were left to his own devices on a desert island with a plentiful supply of bricks and mortar, we could imagine him erecting a gigantic pinnacle of bricks, without purpose or meaning, where a more intelligent man would have endeavoured to construct a shelter against the rigours of the climate.",

      "abstract": "never-never land. In the reality of a concrete context, we are able to grasp the point of a text without slipping into an infinite regress bereft of meaning. 73 Moreover, neither traditions nor prejudices are mere mental forms or ideas that can be replaced by simply imagining different forms or ideas. Prejudices and interests often are learned or absorbed in a deep sense; they become in individuals. Prejudices and interests, then, are not like a pair of rose-colored glasses that can be removed and replaced with a pair of green-tinted glasses. To the contrary, once entrenched or learned, particular prejudices and interests are not easily changed or shaken, though they always remain contingent and potentially alterable.74 Additionally, prejudices, interests, and traditions arise from and are constituted by experiences that are mediated through language. And language, as a practical activity, is communicated through concrete experiences and actions.75 For example, a child learns through a multitude of social interactions the meaning of being a doctor in our society. The child might be a patient of a doctor who talks to and physically treats 73. At a particular point in time, a text can seem to have a multiplicity of meanings only if we imagine it as decontextualized, as existing in some abstract sense. But as Stanley Fish notes, we always encounter a text in a concrete context, and hence, the text always has a determinate meaning (though that meaning can change as the context changes). See Stanley Fish, Normal Circumstances, Literal Language, Direct Speech Acts, the Ordinary, the Everyday, the Obvious, What Goes Without Saying, and Other Special Cases, in INTaPREI1vE SOCIAL SCIENCE A READER, supra note 38, at 243, 256. 74. To me, Gadamer does not adequately make this point, although it is implicit in his approach. Pierre Bourdieu's notion of the embodiment of a practice suggests that prejudices and interests should be understood not merely as a state of mind, but as a state of the body. See PIERRE BoURDmu, THE LOGIC OF PRACTICE 68 (Richard Nice trans., Stanford Univ. Press 1990) (1980). In fact, Bourdieu writes that [1]anguage is a body technique. PIERRE BOURDIEU, LANGUAGE AND SYMBOLIC POWER 86 (John B. Thompson ed. & Gino Raymond & Matthew Adamson trans., Harvard Univ. Press 1991) (1982). Thus, we might understand language and tradition as being, in the words of Julia Annas, socially or embodied in various forms of social life. Julia Annas, Maclntyre on Traditions, 18 PHIL. & PUB. A-F. 388, 388-89 (1989) (discussing Alasdair Macntyre's notion of tradition); see Feldman, The Persistence of Power, supra note 5, at 2258-61 (criticizing Habermas's argument that we can separate symbolic reproduction in a lifeworld from material reproduction). 75. James Boyd White writes: [Olur acts of language are actions in the world, not just in our minds. Even when we think we are simply communicating information, or being rigorously and exclusively intellectual, or just talking, we are in fact engaged in performances, in relation to others, that are ethical and political in character and that can be judged as such.

      "abstract": "Abstract Silence is analysed in seven concealed modalities: the unthinkable, the unspeakable/unsayable, the ineffable, the inarticulable, the unnoticeable, the unknowable, and the unconceptualizable. The unthinkable mainly refers to unacceptable or highly unlikely occurences. The unspeakable is considered too repulsive or outrageous to voice. It both overlaps with and differs from the unsayable inasmuch as the latter can signify something that cannot be said because there is no possibility of either saying or naming it. The ineffable often relates to sacred or divine qualities, or approached through Derrida’s notion of différance. The inarticulable can follow from a deficiency of linguistic expression or be identified in psychoanalysis as repression, blockage, or trauma. The first four modalities concern the ways in which silence intervenes in and manages human expressiveness. The sixth and seventh relate to silences at the very limits of epistemological or ontological reach. The unknowable pertains to a fundamental lack of information, while the unconceptualizable refers to the unavailability of an intellectual and cultural apparatus through which certain kinds of knowledge can be processed. The fifth—the unnoticeable—is an outlier both to the first four and to the last two. It shares with the former the presence of epistemological constraints on conveying knowledge. It shares with the latter the presence of circumstances that sever the accessibility of human agency to evidence or knowledge. They are reflected in Bourdieu’s phrase ‘it goes without saying because it comes without saying’.",

Every other content they have means denial of the harmony of names and phenomena. They cease to point toward Him Who loves to be known and they shut both the selves and the horizons. The relationship between them holds back beauty, but stimulates lustfulness. Every satisfaction without that knowledge is intoxication. It is the admission of incomparability along with the denial of closeness, or the admission of closeness along with the denial of incomparability.

      "abstract": "To possess the virtue of honesty or kindness, it is not enough to act sometimes in honest or kind ways. Virtues, like character traits in general, are standing properties of agents that explain their actions. Over the past decade or so, philosophers have debated whether the findings of experimental social psychology undermine the traditional confidence that people do indeed possess such dispositions. This debate has supposed that dispositions are states that generate a particular kind of output from a particular kind of input. The fragility of a vase, on this view, is the disposition to shatter when struck with a certain amount of force. Likewise, the virtue of compassion is, or includes, a disposition to respond to other people's suffering, or the prospect of it, with actions, or at least thoughts and feelings, that tend towards alleviating or averting that suffering. The disagreement has concerned whether people really can develop dispositions to respond appropriately to such a stimulus irrespective of the fine details of the context in which that stimulus occurs (see Miller, this volume, Chapter 37). However, there are many virtues and other character traits that are not properly understood in terms of stimulus and response. The virtues of constancy, fidelity and integrity form one cluster of such traits. These traits may be displayed in behaviour in difficult circumstances, but what seems essential to them is not the way in which one responds to any particular kind of situation.",

      "abstract": "Both folk and scientific psychology assume that mental events and properties participate in causal relations. However, considerations involving the causal completeness of physics and the apparent non-reducibility of mental phenomena to physical phenomena have challenged these assumptions. In the case of mental events (such as someone’s thinking about Vienna), one proposal has been simply to identify not ‘types’ (or classes) of mental events with types of physical events, but merely individual ‘token’ mental events with token physical ones, one by one (your and my thinking about Vienna may be ‘realized’ by different type physical states). The role of mental properties (such as ‘being about Vienna’) in causation is more problematic. Properties are widely thought to have three features that seem to render them causally irrelevant: (1) they are ‘multiply-realizable’ (they can be realized in an indefinite variety of substances); (2) many of them seem not to supervene on neurophysiological properties (differences in mental properties do not always depend merely on differences in neurophysiological ones, but upon relations people bear to things outside their skin); and (3) many of them (for example, ‘being painful’) seem inherently ‘subjective’ in a way that no objective physical properties seem to be. All of these issues are complicated by the fact that there is no consensus concerning the nature of causal relevance for properties in general.",

      "title": "Simulating Panic Effect on Crowd Evacuation",
      "abstract": "Panic is a condition in which an individual can arrive suddenly when in its environment different stimuli appear, meaning excitatory factors which may cause a reaction to the body, more or less controlled. This can be amplified by another person or by a group that is subject to the same stimuli, usually transforming it in a violent terror. In this case, the judgment of an individual comes to be dominated only by the primary instinct of survival forgetting about others. In the category of stimuli that can cause panic are: fires, earthquakes, impossibility to leave a space, various transportation accidents, an outbreak infection etc. That means that the spaces in which crowded situations appear must be designed so that emergency evacuation, when panic stimuli arise, to occur normally with no injuries or casualties. Such situations can be prevented by sufficient exits properly signposted and calibrated with respect to their maximum capacity and through education. Education is extremely important and must be repeated regularly in order to replace fear with individual judgment. Unfortunately, this is superficially considered by the authorities leaving everything to those who conceive the buildings. Moreover, there are some special buildings that are not taken into account, such as churches, which have only one exit. Evacuation scenarios can be simulated only by specialised software in which certain parameters, such as stampede, the appearance of human or material obstacles, etc., are difficult to enter. This paper proposes some ways of adapting the existing software sin order to meet specific requirements, leading to delays in people evacuation in case of panic stimuli.",

      "abstract": "This essay describes commonalities between religious and economic thought from an independent cultural perspective concentrating on sacrifice as practiced among Luo speakers and others in and around western Kenya. Several features appear in common, including concepts of flow, of giving to gain, and of surrogacy. As a response to crisis and to perennial uncertainties, animals have been offered to spirits and divinity for diverse motives and reasons and with varied evident functions. Some explicitly involve notions of conditional exchange, as in entrustment and indebtedness. These can be likened to gambling, investment, or insurance. But the acts that get called sacrifice have other dimensions, behavioral and emotional, that economic terms and quantification hardly reflect. More basically, sacrifice is a polythetic class (or family resemblance without a single core feature) and an idea without simple, direct translation into the Luo language. Nor, indeed, can economy or religion easily be translated either as naturally discrete domains. Under demographic and ideological pressure and amid concerns about rights, animal sacrifice has been supplemented and supplanted by other forms. Remaining unanswered questions concern the origins and future of sacrificial custom, the neural overlapping of religious and economic thought, and ways to balance human and animal sentiments.",

Through an exploration of traditional, Christian, charitable acts – both corporeal and spiritual in nature – I set out to develop an alternative view. Why, for example, is the simple act of laying the dead to rest considered an act of charity? Feelings of pity and commiseration offer an insufficiently firm basis for justifying such an attribution. By adopting the burial of the dead as a sort of touchstone, I suggest that the (corporeally or spiritually) indigent other finds him- or herself in need of charity at the precise moment that he or she loses the ability to react as a person. Sometimes being charitable comes to expression in relinquishing one’s demands that the other behave as morally responsible people ought to behave. Charity involves the question of how to bear the other’s ‘transcendence’.",

Conversely, in some other cases, psychological induced behavioral abnormalities are able to lead to an overstepping of the so called \"normal\" weight; 3. In other instances, the alimentary behavior reflects the elevation of the set point for weight. All these mechanisms are mutally reinforcing and could act simultaneously or successively accounting for the great variability of the individual situations.

This is the process of motivational imbalance or “prepossession”, a state wherein a given need becomes dominant to the point of inhibiting other needs. In the case of violent extremism, the dominant need is the quest for significance, the desire to matter and have self and others’ respect. Whereas the “hydraulic” domination-inhibition process that underlies extremism can be observed across levels of phylogeny, the motivational imbalance in those cases is typically brief in duration. In the case of humans, however, participation in violent extremism can be long lasting, due to its facilitation by a compelling narrative” that ties violence to the attainment of significance, and is embraced by a “network” of trusted others (individuals’ friends and relatives) who validate the narrative and bestow significance on individuals who implement its dictates.",

Ideally, we think, it should be possible to present our progress through life not as a thing of fits and starts, of zig–zags, gestures and recoils, but as aimed in a single uniform direction. If we esteem some things above others, praise some men, commend some deeds, admire some paintings this should be (according to the ideal) because in each case the Supreme Value or Ultimate Good finds expression in the esteemed, praised, commended or admired thing, man, deed or picture.

      "abstract": "Every person’s life is like Kurukshetra; their good qualities are like friends, and their bad qualities are like enemies. Life itself is like a battlefield where we have to make the right decisions to achieve our goals. Seldom does the mind become confused regarding right and wrong, and it wanders; in the meanwhile, we make the wrong decision. As a result, there is a struggle between good and dreadful, false and truth, and true and evil. The term “Dharmakshetra” refers to this. When one is surrounded by unfavourable gesture impressions of the outside world or one’s own physical possessions, the mind is triggered to defend the originality of the intrinsic self, which prevents one from making the optimal decisions. When the mind is surrounded with detrimental gesture impressions of the environment or one’s own belongings, it triggers a lot to sustain the originality of the intrinsic self, which prevents one from making the optimal decisions. Our current field, whether it be tangible or incorporates different facets of life, including the job, family, business, or the social, political, economic, and moral domains in which we are pursuing our vocations, is becoming more and more like “Kurukshetra.” We all need the knowledge that Krishna imparted to Arjuna on the battlefield upon the soul and its features as well as God and his attributes, just as Arjuna required Lord Krishna’s advice in the Gita. Therefore, in order to maintain a peaceful, enjoyable existence free from hardships and ill luck, it is essential to do yoga and to be aware of both God and thyself. We compare the many viewpoints of the Gita via that of Brahma Kumari, who has deep ideas and whose opinions are very identical, in an effort to make the readers feel more secure and conscious of both God and oneself.Similar to this, there are several parallels between the soul, the absolute soul, and yoga, including the Bhagavad-Gita’s philosophical lines and spiritual content. According to the Indian poet and mystic Kabir of the 15th century believed that “(Kudh) ko jano tho khuda ko janenge,”1meaning that “Aatma anubhuti sey Eashwar anubhuti.”Brahmakumaris 2godly version says that “The self is the ultimate reality, and realising it is the key to liberation,” according to the B-Gita. “Tat tvam Asi” 3(you are that) can be seen in the Chandogya Upanishad. Self-realization is the sole path to nirvana, according to Adi Shankaracharya’s4. non-dualism doctrine from the eighth century, “Aham Brahmasmi Advaita Vedanta,” that he laid out in his work Atma Bhoda.",

      "abstract": "Set theory faces two difficulties: formal definitions of sets/subsets are incapable of assessing biophysical issues; formal axiomatic systems are complete/inconsistent or incomplete/consistent. To overtake these problems reminiscent of the old-fashioned principle of individuation, we provide formal treatment/validation/operationalization of a methodological weapon termed “outer approach” (OA). The observer’s attention shifts from the system under evaluation to its surroundings, so that objects are investigated from outside. Subsets become just “holes” devoid of information inside larger sets. Sets are no longer passive containers, rather active structures enabling their content’s examination. Consequences/applications of OA include: a) operationalization of paraconsistent logics, anticipated by unexpected forerunners, in terms of advanced truth theories of natural language, anthropic principle and quantum dynamics; b) assessment of embryonic craniocaudal migration in terms of Turing’s spots; c) evaluation of hominids’ social behaviors in terms of evolutionary modifications of facial expression’s musculature; d) treatment of cortical action potentials in terms of collective movements of extracellular currents, leaving apart what happens inside the neurons; e) a critique of Shannon’s information in terms of the Arabic thinkers’ active/potential intellects. Also, OA provides an outer view of a) humanistic issues such as the enigmatic Celestino of Verona’s letter, Dante Alighieri’s “Hell” and the puzzling Voynich manuscript; b) historical issues such as Aldo Moro’s death and the Liston/Clay boxing fight. Summarizing, the safest methodology to quantify phenomena is to remove them from our observation and tackle an outer view, since mathematical/logical issues such as selective information deletion and set complement rescue incompleteness/inconsistency of biophysical systems.",

It is important, therefore, to take seriously the ontological status of absences, failures or omissions and to consider (for instance) “not attempting to save the drowning child” as having a distinct moral status. While not leaping to the rescue of the drowning child in our example, I may look the other way or walk away fast; and surely the acts of “looking away or walking fast” cannot be construed as violent. But even though the primary locus of moral evaluation may be the “negative action,” the positive acts (of looking away, of walking fast) become alibis by covering up for the omission.

Cephalus is the host of the Republic : the main action occurs in his house. The difference between Cephalus and his friends is further stressed by how they exercise memory. Social strife and harmony depend on the different kinds of goods that are available, namely the private and the common.

      "title": "The Structure of Esthetic Response",
      "abstract": "WHEN ONE ATTEMPTS TO STUDY a festival, fair, or other occasion in which a number of folklore genres may be observed in intimate interrelation, he is quickly made aware of two serious shortcomings in his conceptual equipment. First, he finds that he has no good way of describing the different phenomena, at least in the equivalent terms necessary to make clear interrelations and differences of the genres. Instead, each has always been described in terms of itself, as a unique entity. This, of course, is the classic problem of genre study, a problem that has so far stymied any attempt at a good critique of such mixed genres as opera in literature and music, or the festival in folklore. Second, the folklorist finds that he possesses no given methodology for assessing the relative importance to the whole of any particular event or action. Closely related to this is the frustrating awareness, which quickly dawns on him, that he has no way of knowing what the significance of the particular acts he witnesses may be. In short, the meaning of the procession or the dancing or the singing is not evident on the face of it and cannot be deduced on the basis of the empirical evidence. As a result, all too often the folklorist describes the festival in terms of his own reactions, emphasizing, for example, the striking elements, the (to him) quaint and curious aspects. At the very best, the most that a folklorist can hope to do, if he has not arrived at some sort of solution to this problem, is to weigh all the elements equally. This again is an unsatisfactory solution, though perhaps it furnishes the least distorted ethnography. In the course of a Peruvian fiesta, a boy will show a friend how to hold a skyrocket so as not to get burned when it goes off. A father will tell his children the story of the discovery of the patron saint's image. A young man will dance with a girl, and two middle-aged men will do the same dance together. Players of reed flutes and panpipes play for the dancers, who in turn sing traditional songs of praise to the village saint. There is a procession, a feast, and a multitude of accounts of miracles, of penances, and reminiscences of past fiestas. All these",

      "title": "The Robust Demands of the Good",
      "abstract": "Abstract This book argues that we human beings can enjoy a good life only insofar as we act towards one another out of attachments like love and friendship, virtues like honesty and fidelity, and the respect that enables us each to enjoy autonomy in exercising our basic liberties. The goods we put in one another’s hands by acting out of such dispositions make robust demands. I do not enjoy an attachment like your friendship just because you actually give me favour; you must provide that treatment regardless of my charm or your convenience. And as this is true for friendship and favour, so it is true for a virtue like honesty and truth-telling, and for any form of respect and non-interference. In each case my enjoyment of the good requires you to treat me well, not just actually, but robustly: that is, across ways things might be as well as ways things actually are. The book argues that making a place in ethics for the goods of attachment, virtue, and respect has serious implications for how we think people ought to behave. It means that doing good is not just a matter of performing beneficial acts; it requires performing those acts out of beneficent dispositions. And it requires those who seek to do what is right to let themselves be guided under suitable conditions by motives of attachment, virtue, and respect: they must give those dispositions a controlling role in their lives.",

      "title": "Moral standing",
      "abstract": "Towards whom is it appropriate to direct fundamental moral consideration? This is the question of moral standing. Many different answers have been offered: all and only those creatures that are themselves capable of extending moral concern and consideration; all humans, whether capable of functioning as moral agents or not; humans plus certain other ‘higher’ animals (such as gorillas, chimpanzees and porpoises) that can think, reason and be self-aware; creatures capable of feeling sensations such as pain, no matter how otherwise rudimentary their psychological existence; living beings, whether sentient or not; ‘holistic’ entities such as political states, cultural traditions, biological species, natural ecosystems. The moral standing issue has great significance both practically and theoretically. Earnestly reconsidering who, or what, counts morally could change what we eat, how we clothe ourselves, the extent to which we spread out over the land. Even those who believe that only humans count morally must still address the theoretically challenging question of what it is about humans that warrants such exclusive concern. To try to resolve this difficult issue, philosophers have pursued several different strategies. Some work from plausible convictions about particular cases (such as ‘\"Normal\" healthy adult humans have moral standing, if anyone does’) and then, subject to the demand for principled consistency, try to extrapolate to a more general account of what confers moral standing. Others try to articulate a broad view of the general nature of moral consciousness (as involving, for example, the disposition to empathize with others or promote their good) and work back from that to an account of the most basic conditions of the possibility of being conscientiously considered (for instance, having feelings with which others can empathize or a good which they can take into account).",

Important decision makers are in question here, but the biographer's subject need not be powerful or famous. It may be a person who is thought interesting because he or she is distinctively representative of some broader type than a Bourbon monarch or his counselor-perhaps a seventeenth-century tavern keeper or nun, reforming curate or minister, bourgeois gentilhomme, guerrier de Dieu or grand noble classique, as Labatut describes the duke of Navailles.1 No biographer comes to the task without some kind of typology or model-a conception of the position in the world that his or her protagonist fills. The fit of a real person with the type is never perfect. Thus the question of motives is raised. What accounts for the individual's conformity or nonconformity with the postulated dimensions of the role cast, the station fixed, the context faced? These are problems of psychology.",

      "abstract": "Productive labor is often treated as a means for various ends—for money, leisure, play, etc. This essay argues that work, depending its scale and its relation to community, can be worth doing for its own sake—as an end in itself. Meaningful work is meaning-investing activity. In small-scale production, which involves an intimate relation with the material and an application of practical skill, the producers can invest products with higher-order meaning, imbuing upon them their personhood by which they manifest themselves in public for recognition as persons qua workers and for the judgment of others concerning the goodness of the product. The qualities of the product (viz., thought embodied as functional and aesthetic qualities) are the reasons offered to another on behalf of their productive activity. The recognition of the qualities as reasons recognizes the producer's personhood (for reasons are offered only between persons) and thereby affirms that the activity was worth doing for its own sake. But this is not sufficient for the perfection of work. Producers also crave judgment from the community on the goodness of the product. In confirming the goodness of the product in judgment, the community (which must also be small in scale) perfects the work for the worker.",

Therefore, to understand these facts, first of all it should be kept in mind the fact that Korean shamanism is a religious and cultural phenomenon formed on the basis of realistic and humanistic thoughts and sense of value. The method of interaction between human beings and gods can be much more simply explained not in religious terms but in social or educational meanings. The way of dealing with gods produced by the shaman in kut shows the very way of Korean people's transaction with the government authority in this society through the past.",

      "title": "Psychopathic Personality and Social Responsibility",
      "abstract": "Since there is little general agreement either on the nature of psychopathic personalities or on how to deal with the problems within organized society which their behaviour creates, we are justified in any attempt to present these problems in a new light and to examine the impact of recent work upon them. There is, moreover, an urgent need to clarify our own ideas on the subject in the hope that we can present them in practical form to those social agencies who so frequently meet with the psychopath as a perplexing hindrance to the smooth working of the State's affairs, whether in the schools, the courts, in industry, in the services or in any part of our national life in which planned co-operation is desirable. The psychopathic misfit for whom the increasing complexity of society has allowed no place, and for whom as yet science has found no certain remedy, often manifests his disability at least as much in a disorder of citizenship as in one of personal adjustment, and in no field of our work are we so constantly reminded that it is impossible to consider the patient in isolation from the milieu in which he must live. While the brain is a part, and the controlling, communicating part of the somatic mechanism, the concept of the mind of an individual is not so confined. In that the individual is a member of a group, part of his mental life belongs to that group and plays a part in forming its characteristics. In favourable circumstances this contribution is repaid by the guidance and support which membership of a group can provide. When an individual is so constituted that he is without the inward mechanisms necessary for the efficient working of this process of interchange, the result may be unhappiness for him or loss of harmony in the group. Thus, although it is to medical science that the appeal for an explanation or a remedy is most often made, the psychopathic personality is a responsibility which we must always share with the social sciences. Since the defect of personality is usually a constitutional one, the problems it creates are as likely to be solved by manipulation of the environment of the psychopath than by any effort to change his spots. This is not to say that the leopard in our kraal is not to be rendered more tame, or that he cannot be afforded the help of psychotherapeutic cosmetics, so long as the therapist in his preoccupation with the spots does not forget the savage heart that lies beneath them.",

Apart from these, even the case of action that seems self-destructive in its result need not be considered a failure of control. Of course, there are gamblers who lose, criminals who get caught, and addicts and drinkers who ruin their lives. They are people, often demoralized people, for whom talk of transcendence or delay of gratification is meaningless and for whom therefore the immediate relief or the short-term gain is what counts. In any case, it is a mistake to imagine, when we talk of so-called self-destructive action, that short-term gains and longterm consequences are always calculated. They are not. In fact, such calculations are often avoided: A few drinks, an abruptness of action with a quick completion, a rationalization that emphasizes the single and relatively safe instance of a general and risky pattern-all these diminish one's sensation of making a risky choice. They are ways in which people (some people particularly but all of us sometimes) can avoid asking themselves questions to which, they dimly suspect, the answers will be unpleasant.",

The focus of this chapter is the third of those sets of options. More precisely, it is concerned with some of the ways in which scientism in some prominent views of the relationship between minds, brains and persons, and of the body, genes and athletic performance, seems to contribute to the development and perpetuation of a conception of performance enhancement in sport that frequently seems to be to the detriment of the welfare of athletes. The reductionism evident in scientistic conceptions of the athlete not only paves the way for pictures, reasoning and values that might justify performance enhancement practices (prohibited or otherwise) that may be detrimental to the health and welfare of the athlete, but it creates conditions that render any apparent 'achievement' hollow, and the realisation of that should surely negatively affect the welfare of the individual person long beyond the point he or she ceases to be an athlete.",

      "abstract": "Creativity is acknowledged to be an essential feature of design and technology (DT that is the material of each craft, without which it cannot be exercised...[t]herefore I desire material with which to exercise power, that my skill and power should not be forgotten and lost sight of. For every kind of skill and power quickly grows old and is passed over in silence, if it is devoid of wisdom; because no one can manifest any skill without wisdom, since whatsoever is done foolishly can never be accounted as skill”. King Alfred’s Version of Boethius written in the eighteenth century (Cook and Tinker, 1968:2) Creativity is an ambiguous and problematic term. The creativity of an actor upon the stage is not the same as that which the artist displays at her easel nor the wood turner at her lathe. The ‘Creation’ in Biblical terms is yet another manifestation and the wildly imaginative justification given by the pupil for failure to hand in homework, although different in form, can certainly be defined as creative, albeit frustrating. However, one common feature inherent within the concept of creativity is that something manifest is brought into being. The actor brings a character into being, the artist a painting, the turner a bowl. The earth was given physical form by its creator according to the Bible and the pupil’s excuse is manifest in the form of a narrative. But inherent within this common feature, is a tension, a duality of forms. The action of ‘bringing something into being’, requires that ‘something’ to take one of two forms: three-dimensional physical form, or one that transcends the physical, as in a performance. These two forms can, in some cases, become reliant upon each other, as in a musician playing an instrument, but the object brought into being is only ever constituted in one form or the other: the performance of the musician creating music on the instrument, or the physicality of the instrument itself. Observing the sculptor sculpt qua observing the sculptor sculpt, is different from appreciating the end product the sculptor has sculpted, and for some audiences, one will be preferable to the other. Whichever form the bringing into being takes, whether perpetrated by the actor, wood turner, artist or even the devious pupil, the object of the activity (that which is produced), requires some form of intentional activity to be enacted upon it by the subject (the producer), in order to ‘bring’ the creation ‘into being’. The quality of the resultant object will",

Therefore, indirectly, we can identify two kinds of people: those who can handle life’s tests (disease, suffering, difficulties of all kinds etc.) for people of faith know that suffering and illness can be overcome in Christ - Doctor souls and bodies -, and others who feel confused and without any support to the tests, because their hope lies within themselves or other people, although these things cannot satisfy the thirsty soul's desire for God.",

The methods of committing: physical violence, which consists in inflicting bodily injuries that can lead to the death of the victim, violation of physical or mental health, damage to his honor and dignity, are considered separately. Psychological violence, which is related to the effect on the psyche of a person through verbal insults or threats, harassment, intimidation, which intentionally causes emotional insecurity, the inability to protect oneself and may cause or is causing damage to mental health; economic violence, which consists in depriving a person of food, clothing and other property or funds to which the victim has a legal right, which can lead to his death, cause a violation of physical or mental health. Traces of domestic violence are considered in a broad sense, namely, traces of struggle: a mess in the room, overturned furniture, broken glass, dishes, scattered clothes, etc. It has been established that the traces of domestic violence can be material and ideal. Ideal traces of domestic violence are formed in the memory of the participants of the criminal event. The types of identified traces are specified in relation to the method of committing the crime. When analyzing the situation of domestic violence, it was established that its structure includes the place and time of the crime, the moral and psychological relations of the subjects of the offense and their environment, the social and psychological environment in which the offender is located and influences his actions, as well as the socio-political situation in the country.",

      "abstract": "Does altruism exist? Or is human nature entirely selfish? In this eloquent and accessible book, famed biologist David Sloan Wilson provides new answers to this age-old question based on the latest developments in evolutionary science. From an evolutionary viewpoint, Wilson argues, altruism is inextricably linked to the functional organization of groups. Groups that work undeniably exist in nature and human society, although special conditions are required for their evolution. Humans are one of the most groupish species on earth, in some ways comparable to social insect colonies and multi-cellular organisms. The case that altruism evolves in all social species is surprisingly simple to make. Yet the implications for human society are far from obvious. Some of the most venerable criteria for defining altruism aren't worth caring much about, any more than we care much whether we are paid by cash or check. Altruism defined in terms of thoughts and feelings is notably absent from religion, even though altruism defined in terms of action is notably present. The economic case for selfishness can be decisively rejected. The quality of everyday life depends critically on people who overtly care about the welfare of others. Yet, like any other adaptation, altruism can have pathological manifestations. Wilson concludes by showing how a social theory that goes beyond altruism by focusing on group function can help to improve the human condition.",

In psychoanalytic and philosophical terms, perfection is close to the 'sublime' and more generally to the 'ideal'. One should mention that the quest for perfection is dangerous, not only for the individual who becomes inhibited, but also for the society when a leader can seduce masses through an ideology that offers the idea of achieved perfection. Ideology shows a deep belief in ideas of absolute perfection. It implies not only that criticism has been reduced to silence but also that the individual is no longer capable of being conscious of its own renouncement. Far from a loss of the ego in an ideal of perfection inhibiting or alienating, sublimation manages to achieve an erection or restoration of the ego following the acceptance of loss.",

The scholastic view seems to be at its best in dealing with one end of the spectrum: fully deliberated actions performed by reasonable agents at their most reflective moments. I hope to show, however, that it can also account for a wide range of human behavior that includes merely intentional and merely voluntary actions. However, as we approach the other end of the spectrum, the scholastic view might seem to be in a poor position; in fact, it may seem that it is completely inadequate to explain the actions of the perverse, the odd or mentally ill, children, and other mammals. And one could argue that a view that tries to understand human action in a way that cannot accommodate these instances of human and nonhuman action cannot claim success. After all, the fact that there is such a continuum seems to speak in favor of a unified explanation for the whole spectrum of animal behavior.",

      "abstract": "\"Castles in the clouds, flying by; men will build them till they die; don't they know it's all a lie, tumbling castles make them cry; still they try…1\" Identity is shaped by thoughts, ideas, feelings and emotions; expressed in words, actions and expressions; and recorded for posterity in mentifacts and artifacts. \"Paper\" (or \"plastic\") identity, found on various identification cards, electronic databases, resumés and curriculum vitaes, is not necessarily be the same as the \"flesh and blood\" or real-life identity known best to those with whom face-to-face interaction takes place over long periods of time in various day-to-day situations. Status is both achieved and ascribed, and the degree to which one or the other contributes more draws the thin line between the real and apparent. To achieve means \"to carry out successfully (accomplish);\" \"to get or attain as a result of exertion (reach),\" or \"to attain a desired end or aim (to become successful).\"2 To ascribe, on the other hand, comes from the restored spelling of the Middle English ascrive, etymologically derives from the Old French. ascrivre, \"to attribute, inscribe,\" and the Latin ascribere \"to write in, to add to in a writing,\" from ad- \"to\" + scribere \"to write.\"3 To ascribe is to refer to a supposed cause, source, or author, and \"suggests an inferring of cause, quality or authorship\" as in the case of \"forged paintings formerly ascribed to masters.\"4 Achievement rightfully bestows an earned \"headship,\" implied in its etymology from the Old.French. achever \"to finish,\" from the phrase à chef (venir) \"at an end, finished,\" the Vulgate Latin *accapare, from the Latin ad caput (venire). Literally, both the Old.French and Latin phrases mean \"to come to a head,\" from the Latin caput \"head.\"5 Ascription is flattery at best; but worse when self-generated and perpetuated. Are vicarious experiences that become \"personal accomplishments,\" casual visits and observations that become \"further training and fellowships,\" comments and editing (even supervisory positions) that metamorphose into \"research and co-authorships\" any different from the fictitious medals of a dictator? Awards beget awards. Those who are thus preceded by reputation may loom \"larger than life.\" Do such giants stand on feet of clay? Our circles are a microcosm of the nation and world around us. Public servants who believe the fictions crafted by themselves and their coutillons continue to claim the right to rule (rather than the obligation to serve). Are we dazzled by the dream? What do we aspire for? Et tu? _________________________ The first meeting of the Asia Pacific Association of Medical Journal Editors (APAME) was held in Seoul, the Republic of Korea last May 4-5, 2008 co-hosted by the World Health Organization Western Pacific Regional Office.6 APAME's vision, it was agreed, would be to promote health care through the dissemination of quality health information in the Asia Pacific Region. The association also established the following aims: To upgrade publishing standards of health journals and books, paper-based or electronic; To develop an aggregated indexing system for health articles published in the Asia Pacific Region; and To enhance optimal access to health articles. The development of the Western Pacific Region Index Medicus (WPRIM) and the Global Health Library (GHL) are much-needed efforts to ensure the dissemination of and universal access to reliable health information essential to health development. These efforts will level the playing field for authors, editors, peer reviewers, publishers and subscribers in developing countries, elevating loco-regional research and publishing to the global arena. Following our continued compliance with established standards, we anticipate inclusion of the Philipp J Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg in the WPRIM. Through its President Gil M. Vicente, and the Board of Trustees, our Society blazes new trails to lead us beyond the confines of self-directed concerns toward new horizons of hope for our various publics, present and future. Efforts aimed at health-promotion and disease-prevention, side by side with involvement in ecological and environmental concerns may prove to be as, or even more important, than the equally quixotic pursuit of cutting-edge diagnostic and therapeutic advances. What use are these when they are beyond the reach of most? \"When the time of our particular sunset comes, our 'thing,' our accomplishment, won't matter a great deal. But the clarity and concern with which we have loved others will speak with vitality of the great gift of life we have been to each other.\"7 &nbsp",

      "title": "Peculiarities of behavior of juvenile victims of violent incest",
      "abstract": "The article considers the peculiarities of the behavior of juvenile victims of violent incest. It is indicated that the following features should be taken into account when studying the typology of victims of violent incest: 1) biological and psychological features and types of victims; 2) circumstances that preceded / contributed to the commission of the violent act; 3) the behavior of the victim at the time of the act of violence and after it. Establishing these features will provide an opportunity to more fully and correctly classify juvenile victims of violent incest. The author points out that in the general sense, the types of juvenile victims of sexual crimes do not differ sharply from the general public. At the same time, the typology of such persons is somewhat narrowed due to the frequent dominance of certain features that provoke the criminal offender to commit an illegal act. For example, if a person seeks to commit theft or robbery / robbery, the victim often plays a secondary role, as circumstances that contribute to the offense come to the fore (dark time of day, absence of outsiders, etc.). In the case of violent incest or any other socially dangerous act of a sexual nature, the language focuses on the victim as the \"object of desire.\" That is why the criminal offender usually pays attention to two aspects: the biological characteristics of the victim and the psychological characteristics (behavioral reactions). A study of statistics and jurisprudence concluded that in most cases this type of criminal offense is committed against juveniles who have an attractive appearance and passive behavior (do not make excessive efforts to protect and prevent incest). Attention is drawn to the fact that the provocation of violent incest is inherent in older minors and is due to the desire to prove to their loved ones their adulthood, sexuality and readiness for sexual intercourse. Often such victims seek to feel wanted, but do not understand the real threat of experiencing illegal sexual influence, especially from a close relative.",

The fact that life is a precondition of the value which the content of that life may have is neither here nor there. The requirement to respect the life of others is not subject to the variations which affect the value of the contents of the life of people. Our duty to respect people's life does not vary in scope or strength with variations in the value of the content of the life of those people. Possibly, it is somewhat sensitive to the value of those people's lives. We may not owe the same respect to the life of murderers as to the life of others. Our duty to respect the life of others, however, does not vary in tune with every fluctuation in the value of the contents of the life of those others.",

These are the learning disabilities that result from how children with autism take in information about the world differently from other children. From the point of view of diagnostic symptoms, these disabilities in learning stem from processing sensory information differently, and apparently extracting and processing meaning differently. Children with autistic spectrum disorders may over- or under-respond to different sorts of sensory stimuli: A child with autism may hear something and ignore it; or he may hear something chat is so apparently intense that he covers his ears with his hands or flaps his arms and vocalizes in a frantic perturbed fashion. A child with autism may see something (or someone) and seemingly “look right through” what he sees; or he may seize the object with one hand, hold it to the periphery of his vision with a strong vertical orientation, and stare fixedly at it out of the corners of his eyes, while rotating it slightly back and forth. A child with autism may assiduously ignore strangers, but selectively approach anyone with fluffy hair and grab the hair and smell it.",

      "abstract": "In most human endeavors collaboration is spontaneously taken to be a sensible and good thing to do, not unlike drinking more water and eating more fruit and vegetables. Whether building a new secondary school or flying a 747, it is more efficient to divide up the various tasks than it is for someone to build or fly solo. But while collaborating is commonly experienced, that does not mean the dynamics of collaborating efficiently are easily understood. Function is likewise a common experience that is not so easily understood. It is not so difficult to identify, for example, when the refrigerator is not functioning well. Nor is it difficult to identify what to do in such instances: we call a mechanic, the one who knows how to get it functioning again. However, if we consider recurrence schemes of dysfunctioning local high schools or local economies, things are not so simple. Whom do we call? How do we move from “something is amiss” to “what we ought to do is ...”? The thesis of the essay is that Bernard Lonergan discovered a way to collaborate efficiently and that whatever small steps we might take to foster such collaboration are good steps leading to adventure.

      "abstract": "Transformative experiences are experiential states that radically alter a person in some way, such as what the person can know or understand, their core values or preferences, their overall outlook on the world, and so on. Notable historical examples plausibly include the Apostle Paul's epiphany and sudden conversion to Christianity on the road to Damascus, St. Augustine's moral and spiritual transformation after the death of a close friend, and similar transformations by the Buddha and Muhammed. Such experiences have been argued to pose philosophical challenges for rational choice, as it appears unclear how one can make rational life‐choices about experiences one does not understand or which otherwise fundamentally transform oneself or one's values. Some theorists argue that rational choices involving transformative experiences are impossible. Others argue that transformative experiences instead pose a challenge to making choices that are both rational and authentic. Others still are unconvinced that transformative experiences pose any serious or unique problems to rational choice, contending that the problems they present are either exaggerated or reducible to problems unrelated to transformative experience. Finally, many solutions have been advanced for resolving the problems that transformative experiences are alleged to pose, including that transformative experiences can be chosen for their own sake, chosen on the basis of objective evidence such as statistics and testimony, chosen on the basis of imaginative comparison to relevantly similar past experiences, or, alternatively, be rationally grappled with by the development of internal mastery such as personal resilience or through moral behavior.",

Blame comes from the Latin blasphemare, to revile or blaspheme. Far beyond the assignment of credit and blame, people across the world typically package their social experiences in stories: explanatory narratives incorporating limited numbers of actors, just a few actions, and simplified cause-effect accounts in which the actors' actions produce all the significant outcomes.",

      "abstract": "R. is a 40-year-old, divorced, White male with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, paranoid type, chronic. Shortly after his entrance into our work rehabilitation program, R. engaged one of the authors (P.L.) in a conversation about the nature of his illness. He reported that his most disabling and pervasive symptom was a persistent inability to pursue any goal in his life. R. recognized that he had other symptoms of psychiatric illness but stated that these did not account for his disability. He explained that the voice of God that counseled him when he felt overwhelmed and his fear that God was about to kill him as punishment for his sins put life in perspective and, consequently, were sometimes as comforting as they were distressing. R. explained that what had altered his life was a process, invisible to others, that left him unable to plan out and pursue a life course. He did not know whether it was a lack of knowledge or lack of motivation and energy that left him without the inner direction he needed. All he knew was that it was \"schizophrenia,\" and it left him unable to work or to function like other people. What R. was describing as the foundation of his illness and his disability appears to be a disturbance of volition. Interestingly, self-understanding is more consistent with several of the early formulations of schizophrenia than it is with current formulations. To explore the merits of R.'s belief about his illness we offer a review of the role that disturbance of volition has played in historical conceptualizations of schizophrenia, the current nosology, and in theories of the negative or deficit syndrome. The history of R.'s illness is then presented. Lastly, we discuss what we learned from R.'s participation in a paid work program.",

      "abstract": "I have talked of scales, of talionic equivalence, and of getting even, of revenge and redemption. I thus introduced “oddmen” (the arbitrators) and “unevenmen” (those who refused to submit to arbitration and refused to pay for their wrongs); we have seen how people equilibrate, commensurate, evaluate, and price pretty much everything when called on to do so. Redemption, the foundation of their moral edifice, requires no less. We have seen them mint coin in the strangest of substances: in living flesh, dead flesh, animal or human, parted or whole, in blood, grain, and peppercorns, as well as in what we have come to think of as traditional money substances like silver and gold. I have spoken of the play in the joints of actual instruments of measurement, and the play, the ambiguities, in the conceptual joints of payback and redemption so that peace and “satisfaction” could be achieved, at least for a while.",

      "abstract": "Whistleblowers speak out about illegal or unethical actions at work. One of most striking aspects of listening to whistleblowers is how they feel silenced. As one whistleblower put it, \"They wouldn't talk about it, and they wouldn't talk about not talking about it.\" Silence does not just mean the absence of speech. Silence means that one party to the dialogue refuses to engage the other. Whistleblowers try to talk about what the organization is doing. Their bosses will only talk about the whistleblowers and their problems. \"Nuts and sluts\" is the name given to this strategy by experienced whistleblowers, in which the goal of the organization is to turn the issue into one of the mental health or morality of the whistleblower. What is unsaid, what cannot be spoken, is almost always the moral and ideological corruption of the organization. Corruption means the loss of an organization's mission. Society is a conspiracy of silence against those who cross an invisible boundary that most of us will not recognize, for to do so would establish our willingness to do almost anything to belong.",

      "abstract": "Individuals with an emotional anchor and a sense of self can view others as separate and different. But, if a person has no sense of personal value, inner stability, or lasting internal identity, they desperately search for the elements in others. For the pre-psychotic or on the edge of psychosis patients, the motive seems to be one of controlling the analyst and discarding unwanted poisonous parts of self or object. The anxiety state is part of an internal collapse that is perpetuated by violent projective identification dynamics of demand and disappointment. If the patient is to mature and mourn the loss of control and love he demands in phantasy and projection, he must become his own container of acceptance and knowledge. Robert Waska has noted how primitive phantasies of dread, desire, loss, and demand within pathological cycles of projective identification leave some patients trapped in a very primitive and persecutory internal world of dead objects, broken promises, and unbearable loss.",

      "title": "Anger and its Management",
      "abstract": "Everybody feels anger from time to time. People have been documented feeling anger since biblical times when God was considered angry. Babies even exhibit signs that are interpreted as anger, such as crying or screaming. Anger is not in any way unique to people. Animals also have the ability to feel and express anger. In our personal lives we get angry over at least one thing on almost a daily basis, whether it is on thejob, with a spouse or loved one, or perhaps with a figure of authority. Anger is a healthy emotion when it is expressed appropriately. When it is not, it can have devastating effects. Anger is at the root of many personal and social problems, e.g. child abuse, domestic violence, physical and verbal abuse and community violence etc. Problematic interpersonal relations may also disrupt employment activities because of the interference of anger on workplace performance. Anger can destroy relationships, obstruct problem solving skills, and increase social withdrawal. Anger also affects our physical health. For example, it can tax our immune system; contribute to headaches, migraines, severe gastrointestinal symptoms, hypertension, and coronary artery disease. Anger is a healthy and valid emotion. But many of us are taught not to express or show our anger. There's no doubt about it: we live in an angry society. Signs that anger abounds are all over the place. There is desk rage, road rage, spousal abuse, sports rage and most recently spam rage. Anger is a worldwide phenomenon and referrals to anger management programs have exploded since. Present paper attempt to explore anger and its remedial aspects in a theoretical context.",

A voyeur may observe others without them being aware of it by a number of strategies. The voyeur may observe the subject from a distance, or use stealth to observe the subject with the use of peep-holes, two-way mirrors, hidden cameras, secret photography and other devices and strategies. Secret photography may involve the use of normal cameras, but with the photographer being concealed. Sometimes the camera itself is disguised or concealed. The use of telephoto lens enables the distance from the subject to provide concealment. The principal characteristic of voyeurism is that the voyeur does not normally relate directly with the subject of his/her interest, which is often unaware of being observed.",

This research uses case studies, qualitative phenomenological studies, descriptive qualitative, normative law, cross-sectional and case reports taken from articles published from 2016 to 2020.Results and analysis: researchers found 6 articles that were appropriate and met the inclusion criteria for describing ideas when delusions occur in schizophrenic patients, namely having a magical item or tool, having supernatural powers or abilities, experiencing possession or being possessed by a creature, having a high position, feeling frightened by a creature, feeling empty or hollow in the heart, feeling hurt or physically harmed, fasting or certain rituals, feeling like receiving magic/witchcraft from other people, meeting supernatural beings, thinking that other people feel jealous/envy, feeling like they are going to be killed , feels physically disabled/damaged, claims to be God and is controlled by God. As for the aggressive ideas that arise, such as injuring other people, injuring themselves or having suicidal ideas when their delusions occur, even schizophrenic patients when delusions occur in the form of delusions of being chased have ideas about killing because they feel excessively suspicious and feel like they are being chased.

In everyday life we do not perceive this organic relationship, but only when our chain of actions and patterns is interrupted, suspended or broken. Observing the body actions from the outside we almost always have a feeling of emotional and muscular contact with the person who performs a chain of actions. When, for some reason, an action is interrupted, suspended, diverted or stopped, the production of meaning and sense continues beyond the interruption or breakage. The suspension is, in addition to being an observable motor fact, the sign and the index of other alternative senses. When children point to something without touching it and, at the same time, they observe their father or mother looking for an affective complicity in them; when a young woman performs a performance on the edge of an abyss and places her body in a liminal state; when the actor points out of the scene and looks out into the audience; when the dancer’s body stops and suspends just before finishing a sequence.",

      "abstract": "Skip Arnold's performances consist of an attempt to become an object, typically by way of a singular action repeated or sustained over a difficult duration. As such, in actions since the early 1980s, he has created bluntly mimetic embodiments of a statue, gargoyle, scarecrow, fountain, or freight. In Marks (1984), Closet Corner (1987), and Hood Ornament (1992), I argue, the categories of the object and the subject vacillate in their distinctness, in such a way that the resulting work of art overtakes or undermines the integrity, or ontological safety, of the body that performs it. In Shoot Me (1992), however, becoming an object raises political questions about the uneven distribution of the right to full subjectivity and the threat or disaster of being turned into an object (for example, a corpse) against one's will. Arnold's performances therefore revel in the difficulties of approaching (or ‘pornotroping’) human subjects as mute or inactive things, and the vital, consequential liveliness of objects in performance.",

Both those who judge some particular person to be courageous or generous or just or whatever (using those words in accordance with commonplace usage) and those who apparently judge similarly (using those very same words, but doing so in order to give expression to their own particular systematic and coherent understanding of the virtues) will of course do so on the basis of some set of actions by that person. And it may well be the case, indeed it often enough is the case, that it is on the basis of the very same set of actions, performed in some limited set of situations, that both parties judge that particular person courageous or generous or just. Because he or she on a limited, but sufficiently numerous, range of occasions has done particular brave or generous or just actions and has not performed any clearly cowardly or niggardly or unjust actions, a settled disposition so to act is ascribed. But what it is crucial to notice is that although both parties are ascribing a disposition, using the same words to do so, it is not the same disposition that is being ascribed. The same sentences are being employed, but the judgements to which they give expression are in fact different. Wherein does the difference lie?",

Conductor's default implies that the conductor is consistently starting in more or less the same way regardless of the character of the music. Since coordination and counterbalance is at the core of and requisite to expressive conducting, holding a part of the body in a position to correct or solve a problem can never work.

This is someone whose only aim in life is to maximize profit, gain, and self-satisfaction. An organization with similar aims would operate on the same terms and would similarly be without a conscience. This chapter argues that business without conscience would lead to organizational destruction and/or environmental catastrophe and is consequently unsustainable. The screening of people without conscience—referred to in psychology as psychopaths—away from organizational leadership positions is therefore recommended and could be achieved via the appointment of caring, empathetic individuals to leadership.",

Complex: Once perplexity takes hold, it unwinds in multiple lines of wonder and worry; it precipitates many pathways of seeking; it evokes manifold responses that answer, hesitantly or jubilantly, to what God is or is not; it calls forth many hymns of mindfulness or lamentation that appeal to, or praise, what so shows itself as divine. One might have the suspicion that all of this, in a sense, is too much, and one would not be entirely wrong. Given all that, given the simplicity and the complexity, I think it worthwhile to highlight some of the crucial features of the overall approach as more fully outlined in the work as a whole.1",

      "abstract": "No research in the field of aesthetics can avoid the question of the value which every work of art poses as urgently as does every living thing: its raison d’être. Traditional aesthetics conceived only an absolute value. That is why it attempted to establish absolute, eternal criteria. More modest, the psychologist of the creative person, the philosopher of creativity and the historian of civilizations tend to acknowledge a value which is of relative importance only. Certain works suggest new criteria and survive them. Others, which conform to established criteria, frequently die with them. A work which does not beget, sooner or later, its own public and the sensitivity which recognizes itself in it, would consequently be ephemeral. The commercial value of an artistic production is determined by the intensity and the duration of the satisfaction that it procures for a sufficiently widespread need. The relation between supply and demand also regulates the market for that curious species of merchandise which paintings, books, songs, etc., represent-but not definitively. The creative work is quite often devoid of “exchange value” because it scarcely encounters a demand before it has stimulated one. It is sought only after it has been found, sometimes a long time after the death of the artist.",

      "abstract": "Physicalist theories of mind have given good accounts of mental states like belief and desire. But they seem to stumble badly when they deal with qualitative states such as experience of colour. It is hard to accept that the red quale I experience when I see a stop signal is nothing more than a material or functional state of my nerves. The brute phenomenological red may well be an aspect, or a mode of presentation, of some physical thing, but it is also what we originally see it as, viz., brute phenomenological red. And it is enormously difficult to place a brute phenomenological colour in a purely physical, material or functional, picture of the mind. Something else which bears some special relation to the quale may be in the physical order-that much is unproblematic. But to say the quale, the brute phenomenological colour, itself is in the physical order of the mind (e.g., functionally or materially) seems to be to go too far. Intuition remains perplexed, and physicalists go on trying to appease it, but with nothing like the success they have had with belief and other propositional attitudes. In this paper I would like to take a new approach. Let us suppose the physicalists are wrong and brute phenomenological colours cannot be either eliminated,' or 'reduced'2 in a way which somehow or other robs them of their brute phenomenological status. What should we then say about colours?",

      "abstract": "Without the ability to categorize, a child's life would be chaotic, since his or her world contains an infinite number of discriminably different entities. Assigning objects or events or attributes to categories provides the child's world with stability: Each entity no longer must be treated as unique. Entities assigned to the same category are alike in important respects, and thus can be treated similarly. Categories also allow a child to go beyond the information perceptually available from observing an entity, to make inferences about that entity. Consider the case of an opaque object that is currently stationary. Once the category assignment of that object is known, a child can predict both the internal (invisible from the surface) attributes of the object and the functions or characteristic actions of the object (based largely on the correlated form attributes).",

      "title": "Построение жизни субъектом: саморегуляция и/или самоорганизация",
      "abstract": "Life’s journey is analyzed as a result of the transition from long-range goals and plans into the history of life, organized and regulated by a person as a subject of life. Based on the contextual-level model of the value-conceptual organization of life activity, we distinguish functional and structural units of life regulation (act, activity, communication, sphere of life, life as a whole, and life of event community), which form regulatory contours of different scales and differentiate the conception of the object of regulation. We use the principle of self-motion of any form of activity towards life activity, which allows us to consider life activity as a unity of, on the one hand, regulation and self-regulation processes and, on the other hand, organization and self-organization processes united in an open regulatory contour model. We show specific features of goals functioning in the over-activity life regulation contours. These goals exist in the form of generalized value-conceptual formations, which do not have unambiguous sensual representation and therefore do not give clear and definite criteria for their achievement; they often exist in a subconscious form. This determines the nature of the feedback, setting two modes of the open regulatory contour: 1) the mode of regulation and self-regulation based on the negative feedback through the correction of the implementation; 2) the mode of organization and self-organization based on the positive feedback through the correction (transformation) of the goals. A direct experience serves in this case as a feedback carrier-process. It summarizes various estimates of human self-realization process in regulatory contours of different scales and makes them conscious.",

      "abstract": "Passions subsumes the natural human appetites (hunger, thirst, lust, and addictions); felt desires, such as urges, cravings, and impulses; some obsessions (obsessive emotions and compulsive obsessions); and the affections (agitations, moods, and emotions) of a living being. It is important to clarify the concept of emotion that is to locate it among the concepts of the passions thus construed, and to describe the differences between emotions and other passions. This chapter describes the conceptual boundaries that distinguish the emotions from other affections, such as agitations and moods; from felt desires, such as urges and cravings; from obsessions and appetites; and also from attitudes. Emotions are classified as negative or positive, according as to whether one would (normally) prefer to feel such emotions (delighted, excited, overjoyed, contented, amused, affection), or prefer not to be subjected to them (feeling bored, envious, jealous, frightened, sorrow, embarrassed, humiliated).",

      "title": "Autonomy and Blameworthiness",
      "abstract": "Certain cases emphatically motivate the view that personal autonomy — autonomy as self-government — is a necessary condition of moral blameworthiness. The cases, that is, suggest that one cannot be morally blameworthy for performing an action unless one is autonomous with respect to that action, or one is autonomous with respect to the motivational underpinnings (the desires perhaps) that figure in the etiology of the action. Here is a typical, fanciful example. Unbeknownst to Bond, a minute electronic device has been implanted in his brain. Maxine can use the device to induce desires or intentions in Bond without her electronic manipulations being ‘felt’ or detected by Bond. Suppose Maxine implants in Bond a powerful desire to kill Oskar, a distant associate of Bond, together with the belief that the desire is irresistible. Though the electronically induced desire is not in fact irresistible, Bond could resist it only with a great deal of difficulty and only at the expense of suffering considerable psychological damage; Bond, to his astonishment, acts on this desire and does away with Oskar. This case (call it ‘Secret Agent’) is one in which Bond, it appears, is not morally blameworthy for killing Oskar. According to one strand of thought, the judgment that Bond is not blameworthy rests squarely on the view that Bond acts on a desire that is not truly his own;1 Bond is not his own master with respect to the implanted desire that causes him to kill Oskar.",

      "abstract": "Abstract How is it that pride has gone from being one of the traditional seven deadly sins to becoming, in recent decades, the banner under which social movements have declared their objectives (Black Pride, Gay Pride, and so on)? How are we to understand the shift from a theology of sin to a politics of self-assertion (and an accompanying psychology of self-esteem)? Is it simply that times have changed? That, God having died, attitudes have changed—so that what once was thought to precede a fall now seems a condition of rising? Or is it perhaps that the nature of pride is to be understood differently in the two contexts? There may be an inherent ambiguity in pride: associating it on the one hand with arrogance, conceit, egotism, and vanity, and on the other hand with self-respect, self-esteem, self-confidence, dignity. (On certain readings, these may all be seen as different kinds or degrees of self-love.) Thus at different times, different aspects of the nature of the emotion come to be given prominence. Or is the difference in the objects? One place to start is with the recognition that the object, and the subject, of the traditional sin was the individual. The social movements that argue for pride are concerned with groups. How do individual and group identity come together in pride?",

In this way ideas and concepts enable the creation of realities, inner and external worlds and lives. But this constitution is not absolutely unlimited or free, but restricted, determined, following norms, rules, -isms, patterns, customs, traditions, social, cultural, historical, inter-subjective and many other rules, limits, aims, objectives, purposes, goals, etc. Concepts, conceptual practices, usage and meanings are loaded and associated with pre-determined-isms, pre-suppositions, assumptions, attitudes, beliefs, restrictions, perspectives, frames of reference, and other phenomena that will determine how they are used, their effects, results, consequences, etc.The above is earth- and anthropo-centered and restricted. The origins, nature, past, present and future is explored. This is suggested as point of reference and not the minute and irrelevant planet earth. Changes, modifications even the destruction of this planet will have little effect on and consequencs for our galaxy and the universe. Against or in this universal context the nature, the functions, aims, objectives, methods, techniques, relevance, meaning and possibility of philosophy and philosophizing is explored.Reductionistic humans are obsessed with and drawn to minimalist and generalized patterns or sets and systems of ideas as explanations and underlying foundations of complex realities and phenomena.",

      "abstract": "Acting means to feign, to simulate, to represent, to impersonate. As Happenings demonstrated, not all performing is acting. Although acting was sometimes used, the performers in Happenings generally tended to “be” nobody or nothing other than themselves; nor did they represent, or pretend to be in, a time or place different than that of the spectator. They walked, ran, said words, sang, washed dishes, swept, operated machines and stage devices, and so forth, but they did not feign or impersonate. In most cases, acting and not-acting are relatively easy to recognize and identify. In a performance, we usually know when a person is acting and when he is not. But there is a scale or continuum of behavior involved, and the differences between acting and not-acting may be quite small. In such cases categorization may not be easy. Perhaps some would say it is unimportant, but, in fact, it is precisely these borderline cases that can provide insights into acting theory and into the nature of the art.",

As virtue, of all objects, is allowed to be the most valuable, this species of philosophers paint her in the most amiable colors; borrowing all helps from poetry and eloquence, and treating their subject in an easy and obvious manner, and such as is best fitted to please the imagination, and engage the affections. They select the most striking observations and instances from common life; place opposite characters in a proper contrast; and alluring us into the paths of virtue by the views of glory and happiness, direct our steps in these paths by the soundest precepts and most illustrious examples. They make us feel the difference between vice and virtue; they excite and regulate our sentiments; and so they can but bend our heartsto the love of probity and true honor, they think, that they have fully attained the end of all their labors.",

      "abstract": "Equilibrium means maturity, a harmony and balance of tensions that comes from intellectual, emotional, social and spiritual maturity. Clearly the first essential is professional competence, the possession of those varied techniques and skills which can give a sense of adequacy. The social worker is often in a certain sense a lay spiritual adviser whose role, at its own level, is comparable to that of the confessor and spiritual director. For that reason a deepening knowledge of techniques and skills must be accompanied by a corresponding desire to appreciate the importance of moral and supernatural means. In this connection we may adapt the words of the famous physician and say that the social worker tends the wounds of the psyche but it is God who heals them. One can never leave out of account the working of God’s grace, and must remind oneself again and again that one’s role is secondary and subordinate. To do otherwise is to fall into the heresy of good works. Intellectual maturity also implies a true humility. By this I mean a serene acceptance of one’s limitations with the corollary that one is not ashamed through vanity or human respect to seek from others the knowledge that one lacks. But at the same time humility also means a sense of security in one’s strengths. Humility in the face of the mystery of this person, my client, who confronts me here and now, is essential if I am not to be overbearing and patronising, and consequently insecure because I seek security in my attitude of superiority.",

      "title": "A Spherical Model of Spirituality: A Pluralistic Perspective on the World's Religions",
      "abstract": "I. A Two-Dimensional Model of Spirituality O my heart, if you wish to arrive at the beginning of understanding, walk carefully. To each atom there is a different door, and for each atom there is a different way which leads to the mysterious Being of whom I speak. To know oneself one must live a hundred lives. But you must know God by Himself and not by you; it is He who opens the way that leads to Him, not human wisdom. The knowledge of Him is not at the door of rhetoricians. Knowledge and ignorance are here the same, for they cannot explain nor can they de scribe. The opinions of men on this arise only in their imagination; and it is absurd to try to deduce anything from what they say: whether ill or well, they have said it from themselves. God is above knowledge and beyond evidence, and nothing can give an idea of His Holy Majesty. Attar (1) What does it mean to be spiritual? What is spirituality, and why has it been so important in human history? Does humanity have an inherent need to be spiritual? Whether or not spirituality is a need, the question of why one is attracted to spirituality is a fundamental one. The spiritual dimension of life has always been a matter of major importance to human beings. Our spiritual heritage (2) is perhaps our richest inheritance. The Perennial Philosophy (3)--the search for Wisdom--is a cornerstone of human civilization. The world's religions provide us with the most profound questions of human existence. They have much in common in their teachings on the purpose of life. (4) To describe what spirituality is and how it is related to religion, different models have been used. Models, similar to analogies, signs, and symbols, have their own limitations. A model, whether mathematical, physical, or spiritual, tries to explain an aspect of a phenomenon or an event in nature. To that extent, every model is built on a series of assumptions, some tacitly assumed. While there are many models describing the relationship between human beings and the Ultimate Reality (God, Truth), this essay focuses on a model that has been used by many mystics, especially the Sufis: a circle. There are other models. For example, the symbol of many lines' converging to the same point is olden employed to explain the various ways of reaching the same goal. (5) Other examples are that of the valley (6) and the mountain (7) or the ox-herding pictures that are used in Zen. (8) Different religions can be compared to different ways of climbing to the peak and possibly circumambulating as one is climbing. (9) Sufism, the mystical dimension of Islam, (10) uses symbols to explain the essence of that religion. Nevertheless, like other forms of mysticism, it has a universal message. One of the most basic and fundamental assumptions in Sufism and mysticism in general is that we can know the Truth. However, before that happens, we, in our state of ignorance or illusion, have lost the ability to see and to know. To overcome this, there are certain spiritual faculties that need to be developed. With this in mind, I propose a spherical model by generalizing the circular model used in Sufism. A Sufi scholar, Seyyed Hossein Nasr, has described this model as follows: From any point in space there can be generated a circle and an indefinite number of radii which connect every point of the circumference of the circle to the Center. The circumference is the Shari'ah whose totality comprises the whole of Muslim community. Every Muslim by virtue of accepting the Divine Law is as a point standing on this circle. The radii symbolize the Turuq (plural of Tariqah). Each radius is a path from the circumference to the Center. As the Sufis say there are as many paths to God as there are children of Adam. The Tariqah, which exists in many different forms corresponding to different spiritual temperaments and needs of men, is the radius which connects each point to the Center. …",

To acquaintances, it also has two subtypes; one is reciprocal altruism, which is to get more returns in a short period of time; the other is nonreciprocal altruism, which is the focus of this paper. Due to nonreciprocity, it is true altruism; it emerges when a seriously sick (and penniless) acquaintance would starve to death; it evolves due directly to human motivation not to be bottom among acquaintances; it benefits all acquaintances as long as one of them mutates to be altruistic; it is of great significance to human growth; it leads into an altruistic mechanism which makes capable persons altruistic together to incapable ones.",

A notable issue is that of gift refusal, the possibility of refusing a gift in totality or in part, and its consequences. This can apply to the initial gift, to the return gift, or to both. The issue of gift refusal is disregarded in this section for simplicity and because, in a number of cases, it does not matter, or does not occur, or even cannot occur. (It may be that the agents do not refuse because they appreciate the other's gift, or only the gifts offered matter, or refusing the gift or returning it back may not be possible for a material reason or because of a norm internalized or imposed by social pressure, or the giver may be able to refuse the refusal – for instance in not “taking back” something refused –, and so on).",

      "title": "Hitting the Moral Decision like a Ball",
      "abstract": "In this chapter I would like to emphasise that morality is like learning one's mother tongue. No doubt it is learnt and cultivated. But it is not learnt by noting down each and every grammatical rule and its operation. Instead, we learn it spontaneously through environment in which we live and breathe. This becomes clearer when one is at a crucial point of one's life, when one is on a crossroad, when one does not know what should be done; yet one has to act. The decision taken at that stage reveals one's character which has its foothold on certain moral rules which one has learnt in course of time. But the moment when one takes decision, one may deviate from those rules according to the situation. It flashes into the mind at that very moment which is unique and un-repeatable. One takes a leap, from some known rules to unknown, according to one's inner strength which remains unlearned. One suddenly discovers one's potential. There are no objective grounds or practical advice as to how we should behave in a particular situation, or take decisions in a critical situation. We, no doubt, play with the rules just as we play any game with certain fixed rules. But when the time comes to hit the ball we innovate ourselves within those rules. That is why we human beings are so different from each other yet follow the fixed set of rules. For him what is right is accepted with total commitment to the rules learnt earlier in life. These rules are so internalised in his mental system that it works spontaneously. I will strengthen my point by citing examples from ancient texts like The Mahabharata, more specifically from the Bhagavadgita. I will also try to discuss that we have no 'holiday' from morality. We are 24hrs under the moral obligation, the process of which can never be ratiocinated. The so-called rational justification comes afterwards. Thus it is said in the Mahabharata: The ways of morality (dharma) are unknown to us. It remains unrevealed to us forever; still the rules are laid down by our elders.",

In phantasy, and sometimes in the patient's early developmental environment, the object and the ego demand more from each other than either have to give. Some patients cannot contain their urge to possess all and to be all, so it becomes a part of the interpersonal and psychological relationship with the analyst rather quickly. These patients feel something is owed to them, and they demand to be fed immediately. Other patients try and hide these greedy phantasies by being the opposite of greedy. They strive to be independent and charitable, while having great conflict over deeper desires to be dependent and in possession of an idealized giving object, an all-providing breast. Case material was used to explore these ideas.",

In fact, psychotherapy is the finest form of life education. All of this is done without psychotherapists' playing a teacher, a minister, a priest, a rabbi, an imam, or a Buddhist monk, but by being familiar with what they know and more. That \"more\" is about understanding \"the attributes\" of gods and religions as they serve the all-too-human needs of believing and belonging. It is about the distillation of common psychological, sociological, moral, and philosophical attributes of religions, and the recognition that the attributes themselves are faith and God. Attributes that serve the affiliative needs define faith, for example, belonging is faith; attributes that serve the divine needs define God, for example, compassion is God. Those who have recovered from their primitive innocence need to formulate their ideas of God and religion, regardless of their affiliation with a religious community. One may need to resonate emotionally with the God of his or her religion, but intellectually need to transcend all its dogma and cultivate a personal concept of divinity free from any theological structure. Such an enlightened person achieves enduring equanimity by striving to own the attributes of Gods--to be godly. This is equally true for psychotherapists as it is for their patients.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Mental contamination that develops after experiencing a psychological or physical violation (e.g., sexual assault) has the following characteristics. The person feels a sense of internal dirtiness, beneath the skin, not localized, evoked, or intensified by images, memories, or thoughts about the violation and/or the violator. The violator is the central, most intense contaminant. The basis of the contamination is obscure and perplexing because it is not obviously linked to common sources of dirtiness, and the human origin of the disorder is not recognized. The feelings of contamination are unique to the affected person. Objects and people can appear to be clean but feel dirty. Washing, even compulsively, is ineffective and it is difficult ever to feel completely clean. Usually there is a moral element in mental contamination.",

They include a large variety of phenomena, encompassing hearing voices, seeing presences, communication with non-incarnated entities (including channeling), transpersonal experiences, out-of-body experiences, near-death-experiences, previous life memories, presentiments and precognitions, seeing at distance, mind interactions at a distance, mind-matter interactions at distance. We think that individuals experiencing NOMEs should not feel like they were outsiders or diseased; they should feel free to talk about their uncommon experiences and be listen to with an open, not-judging mind, respecting the patients’ experience and narration. In fact, NOMEs are non-pathological phenomena laying in a still misunderstood grey area between mental health and psychological or psychiatric disorders, while some of them suggest intriguing properties of human consciousness. Their ostensible incompatibility with some axioms and theories of consciousness, shows the inescapable epistemological implications of their proper investigation and understanding.",

      "abstract": "Suicidal overdose, running away from home, and scarification are frequent behaviors in adolescence. Like other break-away behaviors, we understand these as corporeal embodiments anchored, in both form and substance, more on the side of psychic productions than passages-to-the-act that are known to short-circuit thinking. These behaviors are linked in part to a conscious intent that embodies the erasure, or emptying of inner tensions out of oneself, “getting a handle on them,” which is synonymous with control, the transposition of psychic suffering into palpable, visible percepts and the attempt to have an effect on people around the adolescent, in order to obtain recognition and favorable rearrangements. They are also unconscious and very condensed, carrying out attempts at figuration which give form and substance to psychic representations that the subject suffering in his identity tries to avoid or cover up. Most of the adolescents in question cannot put this suffering into words. In order to prepare them for psychic work, we think it is necessary to gradually ally emotion with representation and act with speech. This can be through therapeutic acts able to foster re-binding, offered as supports to figuration. We give some examples from the experience of our staff, which for the past 15 years has been organizing brief hospital stays for suicidal youths in a specialized unit.",

      "abstract": "The new millennium man is living in a completely new context that many people have defined liquid, systemic, global, uncertain about the consequences it could generate. \r\nThis new man will be concerned to face his own context as well as his ancestors did; he will must actively change it and must be changed by it: he has to build his life through it and, together with the others, think about what are the ways they should take to complete their growth.\r\nIn this respect, the quality of the relationship he will be able to maintain with the “out-of-him” will be crucial: at the moment it seems that the fear leads him, i.e. the fear to lose the right street to his personal growth, failing his main task as a man. The relational fragmentation with himself, with the others and with his social and natural behaviour and the lack of plans for the future spread away, making the essential objectives of the human formation farther and harder to be reached. \r\nYet not anything is lost and from the same liquid fragmented context, new proposals and new possibilities appear: actually, often the Answer is not this novelty in itself but what is new is how it is used to interpret the present. So the communitas (community), an ancient form of human aggregation, comes back, with new ideas, new features and new aims.\r\nThis work aims to analyse the issue of community, in particular in its educational meaning and in its possibility to be a mean of growth of the human being where the humanization is an excellent place. The issue, having regard to its complexity has been treated considering two points of view, linked by a common aim. From one side the community has been treated by a theoretical multi-disciplinary point of view giving a definition of communitas that groups together knowledge from psychology, philosophy, politics, sociology, history, pedagogy, etc… through 8 main dimensions (spatial-territorial, temporal-narrative, relational, cultural, educational, socio-political, psychic-spiritual, utopici-eschatological). By the other side it has been analysed from a empirical point of view studying a particular community, the Programa Educativo de Ninos, Ninas y Adolescentes Trabajadores “Alejandro Cussianovich” (educational program for working children and teenagers “Alejandro Cussianovich”) operating in the suburbs of Peru’s capital Lima.\r\nThis research is composed by the collection, analysis and interpretation of some interviews, by a researcher’s diary, written after a period of about one and half year of in situ observation and by the analysis of some institutional documents of the educational program. \r\nIt has been then tried to join the theoretical research to the most practical one with the major aim to underline the central relevance of the community in forming people and to understand whether and how it could answer, for example, to the relational fragmentation problem. In particular, the theoretical research has been used to analyze and interpret data collected in the educational program using the already described 8 dimensions, while the practical research has allowed to find a new dimension (the working-economical one) and some other nuclei (like the family, the cross-culture, the fight, and so on) which must be taken into account when we want to study and/or to promote the community in the territory. \r\nAs a conclusion of this thesis, it has been said that is possible to link community experiences although far one from each other using the conceptual instrument elaborated, and that it would be desirable apply what understood in this research to the educational program work.",

But what may begin as an individual act of will (a posing) is immediately shaped and compromised by what it is posed before. Thus, when a person is proposed for acceptance some office or position, or when a formal toast is proposed the assembled company, or when one proposes give oneself and take another in marriage in each of these instances the proposal is a fragment of discourse cast into an intermediate space, where response is suddenly uncertain. Here proposing is a risk because the proposal might be rejected and not real because what is proposed has not yet happened. Proposing does not have the aura of authority we associate with the act of positing in geometry and philosophy. For proposal is not a logical move, it is a socio-political gesture.

Making time is a depressive-position activity, necessitating acknowledgement of the other's separateness and significance to oneself and of one's role in the existence and well-being of the other person. To make time is, ultimately, an act of love. There are expressions of killing time that are not necessarily symptoms of borderline states but that also signify disavowal of object need. The borderline personality kills time to keep apart from objects. Time is omnipresent and a central human preoccupation. Varying definitions of time arise as a consequence of cultural and psychological influences reflecting subjective and social perspectives.

The Greek concept ofphildtimo clarifies the connection between honour and shame and determines whether or not any action will be taken in order to restore the damaged honour.

      "title": "Matter, Form and Object: Rejoinder to Sidelle",
      "abstract": "Aristotelian notions such as matter, form and substance (or object) should be used carefully; not only is the rich tradition in their background marked by variety of interpretation, even Aristotle's own use of these concepts is far from uniform. In his different works, matter, form and (primary) substance display contents that do not always agree. There is reason for believing that in the Metaphysics Zeta the notion of form embodies (or amounts to) essence, and that accordingly something without essence does not qualify as substance. This cannot be generalized or regarded as Aristotle's standard view, however, for in the Physics there are contexts in which the form is not conceived as (or does not embody) essence. There, “the form or shape” is the arrangement of the substance's parts, or the object's shape, in addition to either all or some of its qualities (i.e., the sensible shape). Outside the Metaphysics , substance, too, seems to be a less distinguished entity. In the Physics , and especially in the Categories , substance is anything capable of independent existence, any particular concrete thing that is a bearer of attributes. To the extent that our modern “object” corresponds to Aristotle's primary substance, it has a similar polysemy. While in some contexts it will mean an articulated object belonging to a specific kind, in others it will denote bodies without organized structure, that is, it will have as extension the particular bits and pieces that fill the world. A similar diversity applies to matter. When understood, for example, as a chunk out of which an artist casts her statue, matter is an object (a substratum), a body, itself endowed with a boundary (a form) and a multitude of properties. But matter can be much simpler than that; it can be a plain homoeomere , a mere element, or as in prime matter, may lack every actual attribute. When in my “Matter and Objecthood” I criticized Henry Laycock's views propounded in “ Some Questions of Ontology” I found comparable ambiguities transposed to contemporary discourse. In the paper just cited, Laycock examines the ontic status of matter, contrasting it with objects as particular concrete things; throughout his discussion no radical distinction is made between articulated objects and unorganized bodies. In my criticism I employed ‘object’ in the same inclusive sense.",

It is a continuing promise addressed to the future. In its entirely free and disinterested nature, the gift creates a possibility for something new to happen. Giving belongs to an immaterial universe parallel to that of the world of order, where everything that happens must have a clear cause and expected result. The order of the gift is what offers human relationships an alternative to the prisons of hierarchies and of violence.

Furthermore, we may then well think, events occurring at earlier times, by causing them, determine those at later times; by causing, the earlier leave no alternative but for the later to occur. There are some other further suppositions, somewhat more radical, which are also quite natural, even if they do not occur quite so easily or frequently as those just previously expressed: As things are determined so that prior events are causing everything which happens, there is no chance for any person himself to cause anything. There is, then, no possibility for you yourself to make anything happen, prior events always and inevitably taking care of things completely.

Naturally rewarding or pleasurable activities are necessary for survival and appetitive motivation, usually governing beneficial biological behaviors like eating, sex, and reproduction. Yet, a broad basis of common signaling and beneficial neurobiological features exists with connection to the love concept, thereby combining physiological aspects related to maternal, romantic or sexual love and attachment with other healthy activities or neurobiological states. Medical practice can make use of this concept, i.e., mind/body or integrative medicine. Thus, love, pleasure, and lust have a stress-reducing and health-promoting potential, since they carry the ability to heal or facilitate beneficial motivation and behavior. In addition, love and pleasure ensure the survival of individuals and their species. After all, love is a joyful and useful activity that encompasses wellness and feelings of well-being.",

      "abstract": "Joint attention is an everyday phenomenon in which two or more individuals attend to an object, event process or property in the presence of each other, such that their attention to that object is to some degree intertwined with the other's attention to it. This paper argues that joint attention has the normative role of enabling subjects to coordinate their actions in a way that would contribute to the rational execution of a joint action in accordance with a prior shared plan or shared intention. This understanding of the normative function of joint attention underpins a particular understanding of the nature of joint attention: what I shall call Rich Relationalism. Rich Relationalism argues for the view that joint attention acts as an epistemically significant interface between the world, other people, and their background plans and concepts. It understands joint attention as an object-dependent, conceptually structured, token experiential state that is shared by two (or more) people. It can be contrasted with non-relational (i.e., Representational or Enactivist) accounts of joint attention on the one hand, and Lean Relationalist accounts on the other (such as John Campbell's influential account).",

      "title": "A Plea for Pity",
      "abstract": "A Plea for Pity Robert H. Kimball Introduction Does the ability to feel pity toward the unfortunate represent one of humanity's better instincts, on par with the capacity for love, compassion, and forgiveness? Or is pity actually one of our morally baser emotions, like jealousy, envy, or hatred, because pity can include contempt for its object and an attitude of morally reprehensible superiority on the part of the pitier? Surprisingly, there is little philosophical consensus on this issue, with informed opinion nearly equally divided. That the same emotion can elicit such contrary evaluations shows how elusive a clear understanding of pity can be. Furthermore, is there something wrong—either logically or morally—with attempting to arouse the emotion of pity in others when they do not already feel it themselves (or do not feel it as intensely as we want them to)? Should appeals to pity be rejected because any emotion is inimical to clear thinking or simply irrelevant to the justification of action? Or is there something particularly morally reprehensible about trying to manipulate another's emotions and actions specifically on the basis of pity? Alternatively, at least in some cases could an exhortation to pity be an acceptable, even desirable, aspect of moral education or an often-necessary reminder to care about the misfortunes of others and not just to pursue our own self-interests? Surprisingly, opinion (at least in the informal fallacy tradition) is remarkably unanimous about the undesirability of appealing to pity. But I think their reasons can be improved upon. Traditional analyses of appeal to pity do not seriously analyze the emotion being appealed to, and most treatments of pity as an emotion do not address its use in rhetorical manipulation. I claim that what is wrong with appeal to pity can be satisfactorily understood only if pity itself is adequately understood. I propose to proceed by combining these two questions: what is wrong with pity? and what is wrong with appeal to pity? [End Page 301] In answering the second question, the textbook tradition of informal fallacy analysis holds that when a speaker attempts to arouse pity in an audience in order to induce an action, this situation should be interpreted not under the rubric of nonlogical causal influence, manipulation, or rhetorical persuasion but rather as belonging to the domain of (informal) logic, and in particular as a failed attempt at argument in which a descriptive premise that A pities B does not entail the normative conclusion that B deserves A's help (or that A should help B). Thus in the informal fallacy tradition, experiencing the emotion of pity is never a valid justification for action.2 I believe this rigid reason/emotion distinction has little basis in our actual belief-forming and decision-making practices. Nor do I believe that emotion should be excluded from reasoning, since our emotions are often informative and are sometimes more reliable guides to action than argument. In Appeal to Pity, Douglas Walton (1997) presents a nuanced and considerably more subtle alternative to the textbook tradition, in which he evaluates epistemically the effect of the emotional state of pity on practical reasoning. Analyzing such cases as charitable appeals (e.g., for starving people and disaster victims, arguments for hardship exemptions from general rules, and alleged atrocities), he emphasizes especially the particularizing nature of pity and the way it overrides universal principles, especially of justice. Under Walton's epistemic evaluation of pity, it emerges as a reason-clouding emotion under certain conditions. Furthermore, he shows how the occurrence of pity is susceptible to manipulation; he emphasizes especially cases in which pity is not actually deserved or justified but is manipulatively made to seem so. But Walton looks at a very small slice of the landscape of pity and what might be problematic about it. So in order to evaluate pity fully—not just epistemically but also as a moral emotion and its role in a fully flourishing life—we need to expand our concept of pity. In fact, pity is a very difficult and complex emotion to analyze (Solomon 1993). Definition of \"pity\" In pitying someone, such as a homeless person, a starving child, or a mutilated...",

However, that is not an abstract fact, but a definition of the situation that is a social achievement. This achievement is consequential: it allows for a form of everyday communication from which intention is drained, but judgment is not. Little dramas of discomposure are thus important elements of face‐work that can be analyzed as such: They allow for a negotiation of identity through reaction to ascriptions made by others, but reactions that remain on the back stage and thus avoid negotiations of rank and hierarchy that would usually accompany communications of judgment.",

The here and now are meaningful only in a distance and a span. The apparently immediate needs a medium in which to appear.excess: Things surpass their sense. They are more than the mediating dimension in which they are met. Their excess can elude definition, resist visibility, and solicit reinterpretation.Definitionsbeing: the sense of excess and the excess over sense. The concept of being indicates nonconceptuality: to grasp a thing as something that is (an entity) is to acknowledge that it surpasses the grasping. To recognize something as an entity is to experience it, within a sense-dimension, as exceeding that dimension.Being as such pertains to any entity that can be met in any way. Particular ways of being pertain to particular kinds of entities, with their characteristic senses and ways of exceeding sense.Scholium: As excess, being is often called existence. As sense, being is often called essence. The distinction is useful, but the experiences of existence and essence are normally interdependent.From a logical point of view, being appears as the separate functions of existential quantification and predication. But the capacity to make existential assertions (more broadly, to recognize excess) is tightly linked to the capacity to assign predicates (more broadly, to make sense of entities).emergency: a clash between sense and excess. An event in which excess challenges sense and resists being interpreted, so that sense has trouble getting a purchase on entities.The Emergency would be the primordial clash between sense and excess, the contest that generates the contenders as such, first establishing sense with excess as its counterpart.Unsettling emergencies are non-primordial emergencies, events in which some settled sense is unsettled by some excess.To emerge as emergent is to originate in a clash between sense and excess and call for an interpretation-to issue from an emergency and become an issue, hovering, unresolved and dissonant, demanding to be addressed.Scholium: What is most often called an emergency, the irruption of a threat that demands an immediate response, does not necessarily challenge sense, since the interpretation of the irruption may follow well-worn paths. But such an irruption always has the potential for trauma and surprise, so it can become an emergency as defined here.Emergencies as defined here are not necessarily threatening; they can bring pleasure and delight. Sense can be unsettled by an experience of wonder or rapture.Unsettling emergencies range from a passing confusion to a conceptual revolution to the shattering of a world. The degree to which an emergency can be understood within established sense-dimensions is a matter for judgment. Mature judgment develops through experiences of emergencies of various scopes.An emergent issue may hover in the background, even though it seems to have been resolved. The emergent is pacified when it takes the form of an answered question. It is dormant when it is not even recognized as a question.The Emergency can be defined in terms of sense and excess, as their origin; but it itself would be neither sense nor excess. To define it is not to understand it, nor to reduce it to the terms of the definition.Postulates 1. There are entities whose own being emerges for them. Call them we.1.1. Our excess over sense emerges for us. That we are here, that we exist and may not exist-regardless of how we may interpret our existence-has become an issue for us. We are faced with death as the ultimate excess, the extreme withdrawal from the sphere of sense. This issue can fade into the background as we take our existence for granted.1.2.

It may seem that acting on the desire for esteem is counterproductive, since being seen to act on such a desire is unlikely to win esteem. But this does not hold under all circumstances, only in some special cases. And anyhow it will not be counterproductive to act under the virtual as distinct from the active control of that desire. The desire will be in virtual control when habit or other forces normally produce action but retain control only so long as the action does all right for the agent in esteem terms: if it fails to do so, then the desire for esteem may be activated and may take active control.",

Beliefs, goals, intentions, collective intentionality, etc. play a key role in the explanation of individual and collective behaviour; these categories of intentionality are at the base of agents action plans. New properties emerge because in a context of ignorance and radical uncertainty agents form new combinations or conjectures about the future state of affairs. Thus, they discover or invent new actions and/or new goals; and/or rearrange previously existing actions and goals in a new way. A by-product of interactive deployment of intended action is the generation of new knowledge. When emergent properties - such as innovation - are generated by interactions in product markets cum interactions in knowledge production, the outcome is usually beyond agents intentionality. However, the fact that unexpected consequences arise from the interaction of plans does not eliminate the fact that its origin was intentional.",

It is the place of society to stop us from doing things that will harm others; it is not the place of society to stop us from doing things that will harm no one but ourselves. In Mill’s classic formulation: the sole end from which mankind are warranted, individually or collectively, in interfering with the liberty of action of any of their number is self-protection.... The only purpose for which power can be rightfully exercised over any member of a civilized community, against his will, is to prevent harm to others. His own good, either physical or moral, is not a sufficient warrant. He cannot rightfully be compelled to do or forbear because it will be better for him to do so, because it will make him happier, because, in the opinions of others, to do so would be wise or even right. These are good reasons for remonstrating with him, or reasoning with him, or persuading him, or entreating him, but not for compelling him, or visiting him with any evil in case he do otherwise The only part of the conduct of any one, for which he is amenable to society, is that which concerns others. In the part which merely concerns himself, his independence is, of right, absolute. Over him self, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign.",

The notion of 'sacredness' can only operate within a religious system. It is a concept that may be attached to places, persons, times, or objects. For an archaeologist, conflict may therefore arise over the disturbance of a sacred place, the disturbance of human remains that are held to be sacred (either because of who they were in life, or because of the respect that a particular religious system has for any human remains), the conduct of archaeological work on sacred days or at sacred seasons (e.g. excavating on the Sabbath), and the excavation, conservation, and display of sacred objects. 'Sacredness' is also a concept capable of gradation. Within a religious system, places, persons, times, and objects are commonly graded in hierarchies of sacrality which may be very elaborate, and the location of a place, person, time, or object within that hierarchy will have important implications for the degree andnature of the conflict that arises with respect to it (Jenson [1992], for example, shows how the grading of places, persons, times, and objects on a scale from profane to sacred is a key structuring principle of the ritual and cultural system set out in the biblical book Leviticus).",

      "title": "ELDERLY ALIENATION, SATISFACTION, AND SOCIAL CLASS",
      "abstract": "BACKGROUND Alienation usually refers to certain perceptions and feelings that individuals have about themselves and aspects of their social environment. According to Seeman (1959), alienation is characterized by five symptoms: social isolation (real or perceived), meaninglessness normlessness. powerlessness, and self-estrangement. Alienation is typified more accurately by degree and direction. Social structures and institutions often attribute to the aged feelings of having little if any aontrol over their life situation. Ambivalence and existential meaning loss occur. Frankl (1963), held that man is a spiritual being motivated not by the will to pleasure or the will to power but by the will to meaning. Aged persons find themselves in a state of melancholy where they become desensitized to the inherent values In their own being and subsequently to the values outside themselves. Reisman (1971), maintains>that alienation is genesis of loneliness. He set forth a typology of man as inner-directed and man as outer-directed as a function of the social structure. A social structure imposing direction consists of increased personal mobility, rapid accumulation of capital, technological shifts and constant expansionism. The source of direction for the individual is inner in the sense that it is implanted early in life by the elders and directed towards generalized, inescapable goals. Inner directed persons receive more input to the self with no opportunity for, reciprocity. The other directeGl individual has as its source others on whom s/he depends on for validation and unlike the directed person who is acted upon, ~s engaging in activity. Park's notion (1959), of marginal man emphasizes that while an individual's personality has a physiological makeup, it achieves its final form under the individual conception of self. This conception is determined by the role which society assigns the person, and the attitudes others in society form of him. The aged persons find themselves in a marginal, alienated position. Weiss (1973), has focused on disengagement theory as a descriptive model for alienation. As society has increased in mobility and complexity, individuals are forced to engage and disengage from significant others. This may OCCUr developmentally in terms of age and peer pressure or by formal positioning in a social stratum. The constant shifts in structural definitions reduce the chances for the longevity of relations with others. Alienation and its association to the lower class has been demonstrated in several studies (Faris, Dunham 1960, Hollingshead, & Redlich 1958, Meyers 1959). The elderly person of low socio-economic status not only has been structurally disengaged from society, but if in a lower class has the Iiklihoodof beihg alienated as well. The alienation in terms of magnitude and intensity is higher. Thus mental disorders in the elderly may have to do not with intrinsic personality disorders but rather with structural shifts. Faris and Dunham (1960), found that the elderly residing in the central business districts of lower class status, were more likely to be alienated or isolated and that these factors are thus related to the high rates of schizophrenia.",

      "abstract": "Standard definitions posit the sign as a discrete entity in relation with other signs and standing for an object (either physical or psychological). Thus the sign has two roles, as prompt and as substitutive representation. The latter raises difficult questions about the relationship of the semiotic to the non-semiotic or pre-semiotic, which can be resolved logically (as in Peirce) or rejected as unanswerable (as in Saussure), but which can never be satisfactorily resolved empirically as the phenomenal cannot be divorced from the semiotic. This impasse can be resolved if we drop the assumption that the sign is essentially substitutive. The assumption of discrete entities, at either the phenomenal or the noumenal levels, is a function of discredited substance metaphysics. On a process metaphysical account, the reality of the sign is not attached to the discreteness of any pre-existing entity. The sign remains as prompt and as relational but not (other than sometimes with respect to other signs) substitutive. Rather than defined as standing for an object, the sign can now be regarded much more simply as a feature of an event. This conception of the sign is explored in terms of its implications for teaching and learning.",

      "title": "Tasarımda ilk kavramlar üzerine bütünsel bir model",
      "abstract": "This conceptual project presents a whole systemic tri-polar pattern as a ground for understanding and explaining design, creation and artifice. The basic emphasize is on idea of disclosure of something hidden in lived experience. Be it a designer, a scientist, an artist or just an ordinary user, this model aims to understand and explain how does a human as a meaningful, unique and complex character with his/her significant consciousness, disclose, objectify, systematize and communicate artifice and knowledge into tangible and material world. Before all his duties, titles, appointments and roles that are socially constructed and run as designer, architect, engineer, lawyer, soldier, mother, father, manufacturer, doctor or user, here human is firstly signified by concept With all his/her physiological and psychological existence, human is gathered in a whole of life that is described as continuous, uninterrupted and consequently unexplainable; it denotes a wholeness that cannot be influenced, penetrated or manipulated, that is already operating on its own, that cannot be expressed in language and cannot be known formally. Then, in order to understand and explain, he/she is intentionally distanced away from him/herself and broken down into pieces to reach to initial pattern of network that defines an organization, a system and an operation. The whole will suddenly be opened part way and be reduced into language; aim is to reach to first contradictory meanings that make whole understandable and knowable, and also to disclose first dynamic model that animates those meanings. Unavoidably methodological ground that this project will stand on belongs to philosophy, particularly on traditions of phenomenology and hermeneutics. Unlike objective for which there is a sharp dividing line between a studying subject and studied object, in alethic hermeneutics, polarity between subject and object is dissolved in radical light of a more original unity with its focus on truth as an act of disclosure. Alethic hermeneutics dissolves polarity between subject and object into a more primordial, original situation of understanding, characterized instead by a structure; basic idea concerns revelation of something hidden, rather than correspondence between subjective thinking and objective reality. Consequently, concept of whole in this paper as primordial disclosive structure signifies two things at same time: the human being showing essential quality of subjective and the universe showing essential quality of objective. How can something concealed in holistic aesthetic experience be expressed as a system in formal language as a question, asks for search of first self-evident concepts that are initial clusters of meaning and are essentially irreducible to each other. In fact, in beginning these clusters of meaning are deeply intertwined and sparse; showing a highly dynamic flux and affording no possibility for comprehension. Then, when an ultimate call for knowledge and linguistic explanation arrives, they become denser, thicker, cooler, they gain stability and disclose three basic concepts that are presented as poles of first whole systemic triangle; 1. world, signifying material, tangible, bodily and objective, 2. doing, signifying progressive, linguistic, social and projective, and 3. consciousness signifying immaterial, intangible, meaningful and subjective. This triangle is whole systemic that its poles represent steady states of these concepts stabilizing system it denotes, while tree sides facing poles represent dynamic states of these concepts making system unstable. Finally in this project, when arrived explanation returns to understanding, basic triangle is re-heated, re-activated and encouraged to expand on a productive fractal pattern disclosing its outer layers. Despite fact that it is originated in basic Euclidean triangle, this layered structure promises countless possibilities of connections between spatial poles and temporal sides and affords highly complex formations. The nature of this network pattern is presented as a model of hardware of whole and as necessary infrastructure enabling disclosure of lived experience and tacit knowledge through artifacts and formal and systemic knowledge.

Loose usage obscures the significance of the interactions between genuinely charismatic men or women—usually political and organizational leaders and gifted mobilizers rather than movie stars and athletic giants—and their believers and followers. Adulation is not necessarily indicative of charisma, nor is popular appeal. Charismatic leaders and their devotees together move barriers and overcome obstacles in order to achieve transformative goals. Charisma is best understood as the inspirational component of the bond between leaders and their followers that allows them to act as if they are genuinely moved to maximize what they presume, or are led to believe, are their own interests.",

      "abstract": "What is happening to spirit in meantime? Some exercises in impossible\nThis article reflects on vicissitudes of spirit and spirituality during course of time. In early phases of human history until fairly recently, spirit and spirituality were essential to their history and shamelessly confessed and promoted. Examples of this attitude are apparent in works of Aristotle, Augustine, Spinoza, Hegel, and philosophers of spirit, Bachelard and Gadamer. They generally see spirit as organizing, fundamental and forceful principle that guides and inspires humans towards many great achievements, principle responsible for organising all special attributes and qualities of humans such as psuche, phusis and logos - science, art and religion. \nGradually this self-evident and taken for granted presence and force of human spirituality, responsible for making human history and establishing great and exciting human achievements, has been quietly but sometimes even ruthlessly eroded in diverse ways. Its fate is multi-faceted. It is either simply forgotten or pushed aside, or active efforts of despiritualisation became effective. From another perspective it becomes emasculated and loses its force, or becomes seconded to machines up to point of complete elimination in sciences of various kinds, until eventually, in some circles, an aggressive antagonism towards idea of spirit and explicit rejection of this idea emerged. Merely mentioning spirit becomes a shameful event, a laughing matter, and even a subject of jokes. \nWhat goes relatively unnoticed in these processes is extent to which these dismissive attitudes regarding spirituality bring about catastrophic and barbarous consequences, with devastating implications for human existence, human societies, scientific endeavours, social initiatives and aesthetic expressions. World wars, unbridled violence of humans against humans, exploitation of humans by humans, absence and loss of meaningful human existence, development of symbolic misery, emergence of dis-affected individuals, sociopathologies that reign in societies, darkening of world manifested in flight of gods, celebration of mediocrity, standardisation of humans and destruction of earth are some of devastating and ruinous consequences. According to some these developments pose a serious threat to future of human race - humankind may be on edge of disappearing. \nIf this scenario is true and real, which clearly seems to be case, deep and serious attention should be given to these developments in view of future not only of specific individuals but of humankind as a whole. This creates imperative that there needs to be a reawakening of spirit and spirituality; it should be reinvented for contemporary milieu, circumstances and demands which differ extensively from previous times. What is required is creation of a milieu that will facilitate this re-awakening and re-invention of spirituality: a deep rethinking of notion of community; extensive efforts to pursue without hesitation battle for intelligence; a serious embracement of comprehensive and compositional thinking; a rediscovery of deepest possible understanding of what knowledge really means. The suggestion is that re-invention and re-awakening of human spirituality, through attentive thoughtful listening to Being, will enable human communities to deal constructively with huge problems with their catastrophic proportions that threaten humankind, enabled by concurrent re-awakening and re-invention of human attitudes of friendship, love and care with socio-therapeutic consequences on a wide scale and pertinent for our unique situations and conditions. This calls for deliberate, explicit and communal development on a continuous basis of the art of being with Being.\nIn hierdie artikel word besin oor die lotgevalle van gees, geestelikheid en die geestelike soos dit oor eeue heen beslag gekry het. Die vanselfsprekendheid van gees en die aanvaarde manifestasies van gees in individuele en sosiale situasies was eeue lank die mees natuurlike houding. Hierna volg prosesse van despiritualisering wat lei tot die verdwyning, aftakeling, ontkragting, verplasing en vyandige vernietiging van gees. Die gewisse moontlikheid van katastrofale en nie onverwante barbaarse en in meer as een opsig vernietigende gevolge vir mens en samelewing, wat selfs die verdwyning van die mensheid mag behels, word geidentifiseer. Hierdie besinning lei tot 'n hernieude besef, wat al hoe meer veld wen en bevorder word, dat gees tot ontwaking behoort te kom, herinventeer moet word vir huidige situasies en die hedendaagse wereld volgens bepaalde denkmatige benaderingswyses, tot by die punt dat dit die mensheid van baie leed en selfs ondergang kan red en vrywaar, met die volle verwagting dat 'n nuwe toekoms blootgele mag word.",

      "abstract": "ANIMALSmore on-say-sight than anything else.Their hearing may be as sensitive as their eyes, but this sense may require much more investigation both in the laboratory and in the field before a true assessment can be made.However, from a practical point of view it is possible and desirable to have some idea as to which sense is most probably the dominant one.We humans are so much dependent upon our eyes that it is often difficult to appreciate that there are many animals which have little or no seeing abilities; yet they conduct their lives most efficiently, making up for the lack of sight or poorly developed sight by an enormously increased sense of hearing or smell.It is almost impossible to place animals neatly into some convenient category as regards their senses ; but one can give what is certainly more than a rough outline as to which senses play the most important part in the lives of the various Classes, Orders and Families.Before attempting to do this, it is probably wise to remind students that no animal possesses an effective sense that is of no practical use to it.Hence one can approach the subject in two different ways : one can observe an animal's behaviour, and from some action or actions one can deduce that a certain sense is clearly present or absent.For example, frogs croak ; and even without going deeply into the physiological side of the frog's vocal behaviour, it is obvious that frogs would not croak unless other frogs could detect the sounds uttered.This may seem all too obvious ; but it is surprising how often the question is asked, \"Do frogs have ears?\"There is a pitfall here for those who cannot rid themselves of con- stant comparisons between human beings and other animals.If hearing is mentioned, we too often think of an outer ear like our own, and fail to realize that what we call hearing is a matter of receiving and interpreting vibrations.These vibrations are conducted to our brains, in the first instance, by means of our outer ear ; but this does not mean that other creatures cannot detect sounds and react to them even when they do not possess an outer ear at all.Be this as it may, observation in the field can draw our attention to the fact that frogs utter sounds, and by deduction we can soon appreciate that these sounds would not be made THE DOMINANT SENSES I5 unless they could be received by other individuals of the species ; and therefore it may be said that frogs can \"hear\" or, if one puts it more pedantically, frogs have some auditory apparatus.The other way of reaching the same conclusion is to study, with the help of an expert, the actual auditory mechanism and nervous system of a frog.Once demonstrated this will show, by quite different means, that there really is some hearing apparatus by which the frog receives the sounds made by other frogs.Now as to the senses themselves: these are sight, smell, taste, hearing and touch.Nearly all actions performed by animals are governed by these, sometimes in combination and sometimes even singly.In implying some reservation by the answers ; in fact, a field worker is more likely to provide the clues in the first instance leaving the question of anatomical proof to the laboratory worker.Much more will be said about snakes in the chapters dealing with scent and hearing; but there is no doubt that they are assisted by their eyesight when feeding, especially those kinds that have to catch swiftly moving prey.Lizards are very dependent upon their efficient eyes and few of them, with the exception of a minority of vegetarian species, take any notice of prey which is not moving.This does not mean that they have no powers of scent; but it does mean that eyesight is the dominant sense as will be demon- strated later when dealing with field observations.Lizards also have a good sense of hearing.Crocodiles, too, have fine vision both on land and water ; but their keen sense of smell must not be ignored when studying their behaviour.Although Part II of this book will be devoted to the anatomy and physiology of the sense organs, it seems wise to include a brief reference here to the eye-coverings of reptiles, since these vary.It is a distinguishing feature as between snakes and lizards that all snakes are devoid of eyelids, their place being taken by a scaly window covering the true eye and which is incapable of movement.Most lizards, on the other hand, have eyelids which are easily seen in a tame specimen ; there is a third eyelid as well.Turtles, crocodiles and their close relatives also have a \"third\" eyelid, more properly called the nictitating membrane.This is a transparent covering which moves across the eye and, in addition to protecting the eyeball when under water, also permits full vision under the same circumstances.This nicti- tating membrane is present in the Amphibia, too, where it serves the same purpose.",

Laws cannot replace morality without becoming oppressive. If most of us did not embrace morality, life for all of us would be “solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short,” as Hobbes famously put it.53 To live our lives, we need morality. To understand our lives, we need to understand morality. On a more personal level, we all need to make choices, many of which involve moral considerations. We face temptations to cheat on taxes or spouses, to break a promise that we regret making, to lie in order to gain an advantage in a competition, to strike out at someone who angers us, to ignore someone who needs us, and even to steal when we are needy ourselves.",

      "title": "The Man Who Mistook his Handlung for a Tat: Hegel on Oedipus and Other Tragic Thebans",
      "abstract": "Throughout his work Hegel distinguishes between the notion of an act ( Tun ) from the standpoint of the agent (behaviour in so far as it relates to one's own foreknowledge, purpose, intention, and knowledge) and that of all other standpoints (e.g. legal, scientific, cultural, etc.). He terms the former Handlung (action) and the latter Tat (deed). This distinction should not be confused with the contemporary one between action and mere bodily movement. For one, both Handlung and Tat are aspects of conduct that results from the will, viz. Tun (LA 1160ff.). Moreover, Hegel's taxonomy is motivated purely by concerns relating to modes of perception. So whereas theorists such as Donald Davidson assert that all actions are events that are intentional under some description, Hegel reserves the term ‘action’ for those aspects of behaviour that are highlighted by a specific (albeit contested) set of agent-related descriptions. This is not an ontological category, since there are no such objects as actions-under-specific-descriptions (see Anscombe 1979). Sophocles's Theban Trilogy reveals the central role that these notions must play in any Hegelian understanding of tragic drama. Indeed the contrasts that matter most to Hegel's general take on both epic and tragic poetry are more closely related to the study of action than the standard theory attributed to Hegel would seem to allow. It is more fruitful, then, to incorporate Hegel's insights into such tragedies to the model of action employed by him than it is to try to make them fit whatever ‘theory’ of tragedy might appear to be hinted at in his Aesthetics .",

      "abstract": "Aaron Beck, M.D. explained that irrational and distorted patterns of thinking lead to negative emotions and selfdefeating behaviors. He theorized that learning how to recognize specific thoughts and beliefs that precede negative emotional reactions and behaviors could provide the chance to change unhealthy thinking patterns. Many irrational patterns are acquired from early childhood and lead to emotions and behaviors that are almost automatic and spontaneous. In patients with eating disorders, cognitive distortions lead to feelings of low self-esteem; mistaken attributions of problems in life to weight, shape, and appearance; and maintenance of eating disorders as ways to manage weight and emotions. For example, a person with anorexia believes that she controls her environment as long as she maintains a low weight. She may believe that she cannot be successful or liked by others unless she is thin. The thinner she becomes, the more weight she wants to lose because her perception of perfection becomes distorted as does her image of her body. The patient with bulimia nervosa commonly believes that she cannot lose weight without binge/purge episodes, laxatives, diuretics, or over-exercising. This belief is maintained even though the patient may remain at an average weight for her height. The mechanism of binging and purging causes swelling which contributes to the body image distortion and serves to provide proof to the patient that she is, indeed, fat.",

Because we praise and dispraise, commend and blame men for their actings, much otherwise than we do inanimate beings or brute animals. When we blame or commend a clock or automaton, we do it so as not imputing to that automaton its being the cause of its own moving well or ill, agreeably or disagreeably to the end it was designed for, this being ascribed by us only to the artificer. But when we blame a man for any wicked actions, as for taking away another man's life, either by perjury or by wilful murder, we blame him not only as doing otherwise than ought to have been done, but also than he might have done, and that it was possible for him to have avoided it, so that he was himself the cause of the evil thereof. We do not impute the evil of all men's wicked actions to God the creator and maker of them, after the same manner as we do the faults of a clock or watch wholly to the watchmaker.",

      "abstract": "The literature has sometimes portrayed queer/disabled people as the “Other.” People with disabilities and queer sexualities are frequently subject to ridicule and abuse. Historically, the literature has aided in the social constructionism of disability phenomena in society by depicting the disabled as someone harmful and undesirable. Furthermore, traditional representations of queer and/or disabled existence have frequently been biased and are usually about how the “able-bodied” or the so-called normal people perceive people with diverse bodies and queer sexualities. However, it has been conspicuously silent regarding the plight of people with disabilities and queer sexualities. In a departure from traditional representations of queer and/or disabled existence, Firdaus Kanga presents a first-hand account of the lived experiences of his precarious life in the Indian sociocultural context and beyond. He has to his credit a series of critically acclaimed books such as Trying to Grow (1990), Heaven on Wheels (1991), The Godmen (1995), and The Surprise Ending (1996). As a severely disabled individual suffering from a crippling disease called osteogenesis imperfecta (brittle bones disease), Trying to Grow (1990), a semiautobiographical novel, is a narrative of his lived experiences of disability and tryst with queer sexuality. While his other work, Heaven on Wheels (1991), is a discourse on queer sexuality and disability from the perspective of queer and disabled existence. Kanga critiques the ableist society’s treatment of the queer and the disabled, which is tantamount to human rights abuse.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This article is based on the observation of a discrepancy: The tradesman, arguably one of the most important figures of eighteenth-century society, is astonishingly absent in most portraits of this century. It will be argued that such omission is more than welcome to the individuals in question. The public task of the tradesman is to a,ct as the medium of trade, and in order to perform such function he has to be as unobtrusive as possible, as if producer and consumer were dealing with each other directly. Obviously, no tradesman is without an agenda of his own, but to fulfil the position society expects from him, he has to present himself just as if he were not there. To function as a medium, the tradesman himself has to be, and, most importantly, look medium, that is: middling, average, normal, and inconspicuous. The tradesman then becomes the model of a modern individual: the man without qualities. Women, on the other hand, are denied such a place in modern, functionally differentiated society",

Ambivalence is believed to be intensifying in society, resulting in inhibited growth and impaired decision-making. Researchers assert that humans utilize two basic forms of coping with ambivalence: emotionfocused and problem-focused. With emotion-focused coping, humans avoid, procrastinate, or downplay the significance of situations (i.e., valence-carriers); humans may feel relieved superficially, yet dilemmas remain unresolved [2]. With problem-focused coping, humans seek information and weigh the pros/ cons of alternatives (i.e., valence-carriers); humans invest time and cognitive effort to maximize confidence for the best possible decisions. In contrast to emotion-focused coping, our community excavates dichotomies; we probe ambivalenceinduced discomforts. Our contributors explored a variety of valence carriers.",

Causation of behavior by intentional states that rationalize it is not enough for it to count as acting. Therefore, the behavior must be caused in 'the right way' or by the Right Kind of Cause (RKC). The immediate cause in Davidson's and other examples of causal immediacy is the agent's awareness or contemplation of what he or she is intending or thinking of doing, which is either caused by, or implicit in the agent's awareness of, his or her intentions or beliefs and desires. I argue that RKC can only be a mechanism-the Will-whose operation we are not directly aware of, but only indirectly once the action is underway.",

      "abstract": "Patientia Regina: Patience as Character from the Morality Play to Jacobean Tragedy The suffering o f a patient m a n , though morally admirable, is not the stuff o f drama. Kleanor Prosser, Hamlet and Revenge (70) Literary character and ethical abstraction will generate each other. Character, as an amalgam of personality traits, implies a whole human being, say Macbeth. Ethical abstraction, say Ambition, is a reduction and disambiguation of human behavior. As readers and writers we are gener­ ally dissatisfied with abstraction per se—and bored with unaugmented naturalistic behavior. John Donne, for example, disdains that love which is a disembodied General: But since my soule, whose child love is, Takes limmes of flesh, and else could nothing doe, More subtile than the parent is, Love must not be, but take a body t o o . ( Air and Angels 7-10) Ideas will find no rest in his imagination; virtue without human form is pretense. Yet, how often the creative imagination channels the disparate facets of a character's behavior into a single category—as when Orlando and Jaques (in As You Like It 3.2) dub each other Signior Love and Mon­ sieur Melancholy. The virtue of patience, like Donne's love, will have a human face, must t a k e a body t o o . Patience assumes many bodies from the early Chris­ tian era to the Renaissance. Gerald Schiffhorst, for example, has provided an impressive inventory of the literature of patience in the Renaissance; my own work has described the insistently paradoxical nature of the virtue from its earliest Christian representations. In early secular drama, characters step into (and out of) this virtue. My concern in this paper is these characters of patience and patient characters.",

As people are increasingly expected to publicly legitimate themselves as good and worthy subjects, and as capital increasingly enters the spaces of intimacy and bio-politics, we need to reconsider the limits of our theoretical imaginaries for understanding the value production necessary to the performance of personhood. Specifically, most of the theories we have for understanding the connections between personhood and value reproduce and legitimate the normative, hinging our theoretical imaginary to the dominant symbolic, making proper personhood an exclusive resource predicated on constitution by exclusion; where limits define the norm, the margins the centre and the improper the proper. How then can we understand how people who are excluded from the possibilities of accruing and attaching value to themselves, who are positioned outside of the dominant symbolic as the constitutional limit for the proper self, or as the zero limit to culture, develop value/s? Drawing upon three different empirical research projects the paper builds on my previous critique of the self as a classed concept to develop a different perspective on value. It argues that an analysis of autonomist working-class sociality offers us ways to imagine personhood and person value that are often imperceptible to the bourgeois gaze.",

It treats the art museum as an institution that is permeated by rules and regulations. These are not necessarily automatically respected by all museum‐goers. Indeed, many of them engage themselves in acts of trial and error to find out what is allowed and what is not. Of course, there are also those who transgress the rules because of negligence or ignorance. The museum is a place where complex negotiations take place between the institution and its visitors. The task of the exhibition archaeologist is to observe such processes and to come up with theoretical explanations about their underpinnings. The exhibition archaeologist may occasionally need to engage in actions like those of the visitors he or she observes in order to make visible the invisible rules, barriers, and codes of the museum.",

      "abstract": "The idea of wellbeing and health is being promoted as important and valuable in society. It has been said that, in order to achieve wellbeing, a person must eat correctly, get plenty of sleep, meditate and exercise regularly. The other side of the coin is, however, that a healthy life style can become both a duty and a sign – something you must do and display in order to be successful in business, in society. This concentration on being (seen as) athletic or mindful can take away from our critical faculties and deep thinking, as rather than confront the negative aspects of life, we seek to build up our own personal immunity to those aspects. However, taking care of one’s own body and mind is common sense, as we suspect those who over eat, drink too much alcohol, smoke daily, or use narcotics regularly. Where then is the balance between self-discipline and disciplining the self?This symposium will look at the idea of “improving lives” from different angels, and aim at dissolving the dichotomy between extrinsic bodily discipline and intrinsic care for self. Rather than posing an aporia, we would like to explore the spectrum that includes ice baths, ultra-marathons, and relaxed down-time, as well as mindfulness practices aimed at accepting our surroundings and/or challenging existing structures. Taking care of the body gives us the freedom to take care of others, and ourselves, and ultimately, may reflect a primitive desire to have a full and meaningful life.

By repeatedly presenting a neutral stimulus prior to or along with a reinforcing stimulus, the neutral stimulus becomes a reinforcer. For example, praise may not be reinforcing for some people: therefore to establish it as a reinforcer it must be paired with an event that is reinforcing, such as food or money.

      "abstract": "1 “The mode of headship is twofold: one is certainly ordered to governance, the other, however, to domination. The headship of master to servant is as that of tyrant to subject. A tyrant, however, differs from a king . . . because the king orders his headship to the good of the people whom he directs, making statutes and laws for their benefit; the tyrant, however, orders his headship to his own benefit; and therefore the twofold mode of headship spoken of above differs in this, that in the first the good of the subjects is aimed at, whereas in the second the proper good of the head; and therefore, the second mode of headship in the state of unfallen nature could not exist, except with respect to the things which are ordered to man as to an end. These, however, are irrational creatures, all of which he directed to his advantage much more fully than now. But the rational creature, of itself, is not ordered to the end of another, as man to man; but if this happens, it will not be except insofar as man on account sin is compared to irrational creatures” (II Sent., d. 44, q. 1, a. 3). Quotations from 73 The Thomist 76 (2012): 73-124 AQUINAS ON THE GOODNESS OF CREATURES AND MAN’S PLACE IN THE UNIVERSE: A BASIS FOR THE GENERAL PRECEPTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL ETHICS MARIE I. GEORGE St. John’s University Jamaica, New York E NVIRONMENTAL ETHICS is a field of inquiry that has blossomed only in recent times. It addresses questions concerning the way we ought to treat nonrational natural beings. It might not seem that Aquinas could shed much light on such questions, given that he was ignorant of or in error about many natural things. For example, he was wrong in thinking that species never become extinct, and he lacked the concept of “ecosystem.” He also had a relatively static vision of nature compared to the evolutionary vision modern science provides us with. Such deficiencies admittedly limit both the questions he asks about how we ought to treat natural things and the answers he comes up with. For example, he says in one place that human beings wield a solely tyrannical rule over nature, rather than a kingly one,1 arguably because he did not know that humans can MARIE I. GEORGE 74 the commentary on the Sentences of Peter Lombard are based on the Latin edition in Scriptum super libros Sententiarum magistri Petri Lombardi Episcopi Parisiensis, ed. P. Mandonnet and M.-F. Moos (Paris: Lethielleux, 1929-47). 2 In his article “Thomas Aquinas and Environmental Ethics: A Reconsideration of Providence and Salvation,” Journal of Religion (2005): 446-76, Francisco Benzoni maintains that there is no way one can overlook Aquinas’s flawed science so as to find in him the basis for an ethical precept obligating us to avoid the loss of biodiversity. According to Benzoni, Aquinas’s error about species extinction is inseparably tied to certain of his fundamental teachings on God’s power and providence (see ibid., 465). Later in this paper I will try to show that this is not the case, but rather that certain positions that are non-negotiable for Aquinas allow us to draw Thomistic conclusions concerning how we ought to treat nature that take into account the reality of extinction. 3 There have been relatively few attempts to date to formulate an environmental ethics based on Thomistic principles. I will list here the more comprehensive and/or substantive treatments of this topic in chronological order. Note that virtually all address at some point the question of whether Aquinas would advocate care of the environment for any reason other than the “anthropocentric” reason that failure to do so would constitute an injustice to other human beings who also need to use the goods of the earth. (1) Patrick Halligan, “The Environmental Policy of Saint Thomas Aquinas,” Environmental Law 19 (Summer 1989): 767-806. Halligan is a non-Thomist who misunderstands Aquinas on a number of basic points (e.g., “the difference between human beings and higher animals is qualitative,” when Aquinas maintains the difference is one in kind). He concludes that “Thomas’s...",

Living in the web of life entangles beings with multiple processes of mutual dependency which defy any simplistic idea of autonomy, self-sufficiency, and power. Love calls these calculations into question and asks for courageous unilateral action. The double structure of action and observation of the action in terms of its fit into processes of securing expectations is dimmed down or even abandoned. A true spirit of love sensitizes one to others and cultivates the enlightenment of a widened perception. Love graciously discloses the very limitations of life and the markers of its finitude by addressing them. Love transforms perception, both in terms of its depth and its horizon.

      "title": "Excellence as Completion in Aristotle's Physics and Metaphysics",
      "abstract": "ARISTOTLE TWICE STATES, as a general truth, that being is better than nonbeing. (1) Throughout his works, moreover, goodness of beings frequently depends on their completeness. This is not surprising, given prominence of complete in Aristotelian ethics, where the best appears to be something and in particular the human good is activity of soul according to excellence; and if there are several excellences, according to best and most complete; and further, in a complete life. (2) Now crucial term in this last statement is activity, not for both inside and outside his ethics Aristotle associates good with being in primary sense of activity ([TEXT NOT REPRODUCIBLE IN ASCII]) or fulfillment [TEXT NOT REPRODUCIBLE IN ASCII]. (3) Yet he seems to think that frequently, genera] concepts of potency and act are neither necessary nor particularly appropriate for ethics or for natural science. As highly general terms of art, they tend to obscure specific contours of subject at hand. The complete ([TEXT NOT REPRODUCIBLE IN ASCII]) has a similar generality and flexibility--indeed, it is closely related to Aristotle's [TEXT NOT REPRODUCIBLE IN ASCII]--but even in translation it is somewhat less opaque. An ordinary, unpretentious notion, it can be applied helpfully to a variety of subjects without calling attention to itself. It is one of three central concepts--the determinate, complete, and self-sufficient--in terms of which he explores goodness of things that are. (4) Whether we wish to understand Aristotle's ethics, therefore, or to explore idea of good that animates his accounts of nature or of being as such, we may wish to have a synoptic view of what he means by complete, and of what sorts of things qualify as complete and why. This would require: (1) surveying completeness attained by natural substances--especially but not only living substances--in normal course of their coming to be; (2) examining contention that certain kinds of animal, and most likely of natural substance more generally, are more complete than others; (3) exploring his description of virtue or excellence as a completion; (4) investigating claim that certain excellences are more complete than others; (5) understanding completeness and incompleteness of various activities and motions. (5) Among these various tasks, third has advantage that it can be approached through study of two key texts: chapter on complete in Metaphysics 5, Aristotle's philosophical lexicon, and a discussion of ontology of excellence in Physics 7. In these texts Aristotle explores conceptual and ontological issues germane to a general concept of excellence; in both cases, key premise is that excellence is best thought of as a completion. (6) His development of this claim draws on two larger themes. In Metaphysics 5, concept of excellence as a completion belongs to a broad conceptual realm--explored in chapters 16-17 and 25-27--in which intelligible realities are presented metaphorically in terms of shape and size. Within this realm, excellence grows toward a limit set by powers that make a substance what it is. (7) In Physics, excellence belongs to a world structured by contraries and therefore also by coming to be and destruction. What it completes is a substance's power to negotiate such a world while maintaining and developing its own identity. (8) Having grown to full stature through its proper excellence, substance can keep itself from being affected or altered in ways that would undermine its being; in so doing, it approximates self-sufficient impassivity that Aristotle attributes to thought ([TEXT NOT REPRODUCIBLE IN ASCII]). The themes of alteration and identity are also pursued in On Soul 2.5, which provides an important complement to Physics 7.3. That excellences of body and certain excellences of soul merely imitate a kind of being that [TEXT NOT REPRODUCIBLE IN ASCII] exemplifies--namely, self-sufficient freedom from conditions of bodily existence, and so also from alteration and from change in general--suggests that there will be an asymmetry between excellence of soul's thinking part and other sorts of excellence. …",

      "abstract": "Our medical ethics team has a great opportunity to consider the terminology of\"Moral Rights\", \"Good guys\", \"Understanding the real world\" and the issues about \"live salvation\". What has been mentioned about these terms in Buddhism? In Buddhism, it has been cited that moral duty is the cause that leads to the moral rights as result. When we act the right as well as decent things, we are entitled to get the fair deals in return. We used to forget to consider that, isn't our moral duty or not?, to just either pay respect to the other people's rights or simply protect the other people's rights. Regarding to the Buddhism religion, there are a certain criteria to be \"Good guys\" i.e. firstly, not to make any sin at all such as not to exploit the others physically, verbally and mentally. Secondly, to make merits, such as helping out; showing the mercy and kindness to the underprivileged; donating money, land and properties, or even sharing the justified idea is also included. We also forgot to ask about tempting the others with a certain of hindrance i.e. assets, land and properties. Have you already made the sin with these temptations or dominating the idea of people? How the people will understand the fine line between the sin and meritorious deed? Buddhism kindly advises us to understand and consider the real world in two steps as well as in parallel way. Looking around us as surrounding of illusion. These illusion or fantasies will not be sustainable, only temporarily indeed. For example, human being has to go through aging process, illness and eventually death. What we need to consider in parallel is the matter about \"Within us\". What is the secret issue about \"Within us\"? Brain, spirit, heart or extremities, wherever we point at, will be just only human biological tissues or various elements. Last, but not least, practicing salvation when you still alive is perplexing. Live salvation is already existed within us, nowadays. No need to wait for the next life. Salvation can exist when we still alive. Salvation is to purify our spirit which require proper training to keep it clean in sustainable way.",

Four cases will illustrate that in psychosomatic patients a as if actionability, e.g. as a mere over-adaptation following life-events of significant others, is predominantly given replacing a self-conform action-ability, and that the assertion of self-feeling is preponderantly fixed to the somatic phenomena. Thus the historical life-performance remains arrested by the predominance of unachieved affective moments in the condition of an affective ambivalence, though psychosomatic patients are well aware enough of the existential necessity to arrange temporality as an existential quality of the futural aspects of their life-performance.",

      "title": "The Significance of Names in Ghanaian Drama",
      "abstract": "The significance attached to names and naming in Ghanaian society is remarkable; it is strikingly different from what obtains in Euro-American cultures. Names of peoples, objects, spirits, and God tend to emanate from the interplay of religious, mythical, social, and historical realities (Abraham, 1962). Individuals are named on the basis of the culture's expectations and identification of the personality so named with particular clan or genealogical groups beliefs, birth order and circumstance, status, and attributes (Quartey-Papafio, 1913). For example, the Akan call a male child born on Saturday Kwame. A child doomed to cyclical birth and death is named Bejina (come and stay) and one whose paternity is not acknowledged or who is born to aging parents is called Nyame Kye (God's gift). Asante military tactics and Ga striking power are celebrated in the appellations Asante Kotoko (Asante the Porcupines) and Gagaa (Ga the Soldier Ants), respectively. This system of nomenclature seems to be the basic one subscribed to by many other African peoples including the Yoruba, Ewe, Igbo, Hausa, and African-Americans. Though the elaborate and formalized naming pattern may have been lost among the latter the African presence is maintained through the AfricanAmerican's widespread use of epithets, bynames, and nicknames (Asante, 1987, p. 73). Naming has colored the writing and artistic works of Africans, from earlier generations to contemporary times. What is lacking, though, is a systematic study of the nature and qualities of such nominal colorations as they arise from the various parts of the African world.

Human infants cannot survive unless they are assisted by others; their are the very condition for survival. As soon as the infant is able to perceive or to feel or somehow to become aware of the presence of other individuals around him, he begins to differentiate between people who are able to help him and those who are not. People who can satisfy the infant's needs or deprive him of satisfaction have power; they are the strong ones in contradistinction to those who cannot do so. For example, a mother can feed him; she is considered a strong person, while the unhelpful onlookers such as an old grandfather or a little brother, are weak persons. Those in power are not always willing to help. If they are willing to do so, they are friendly persons, but if they refuse or prevent satisfaction of needs they are perceived as hostile individuals. The child's well-being depends on how strong and friendly the people around him are. The child's first social relations are instrumental for survival. The process of the child's socialization can be considered as a product of his basic needs. It is essential to differentiate between the two types of needs. The first type may be considered to be such items as food, water, shelter. The second type is to be sure that the needs will be satisfied by friendly people who accept the child and are willing to help him.

      "abstract": "This is a speculative essay in comparative possibilities. It looks at some widely separated religious contexts in which a power‐laden relationship across ontological difference – for instance, between living humans and a world of gods or spirits – is mediated by operations on the materiality of the written sign. These operations typically result in either materializing something immaterial or dematerializing something material. But they may also involve other activities that take advantage of specific physical properties of the written word such as being persistent, transportable, perishable, alienable, and so forth. Once divine words are rendered into script, they possess a distinctively material quality and form. They appear on some physical medium, and so are both durable and potentially destructible. Anything that can happen to another artefact can happen to them. The practices I dub ‘spirit writing’ subject the written word to radical transformation, taking advantage of its very materiality in order to dematerialize it, even if only in order to be rematerialized in yet some other form (such as a person's body). Many such practices seek to generate or control religious powers by means of transduction across semiotic modalities, material activities that help render experience‐transcending forces realistic or at least readily imaginable.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This chapter examines Pliny's Letter found in Book 7, with particular reference to its status and some of the ways in which the letter was seen as the thing itself, as well as a symbol for the relation between the first and last letters of the book. The question of the status of Pliny's Letters in his project of self-immortalization is not unrelated to the status of the Letter itself, which always raises, in some form or other, the question of whether it is the thing itself or an adjunct, substitute, or signpost. On one account, the letter is a pis aller, the substitute for a conversation, a dinner, or some other kind of social intercourse that is prevented by the separation of the participants; it may refer back to some social event, or even anticipate it, but it is not the thing itself. Alternatively, the letter is the distillation of the self in the presence of the other, its words and gestures unaffected by chance, distraction, misunderstanding and all the mishaps that interfere with communication, causing intentions to go astray and meanings to be imperfectly conveyed. It is the thing itself and not a substitute.",

      "abstract": "No one can escape the suffocation of occupation. It denies innate human freedoms and imposes a state of unnatural uncertainty in the unconscious self. Each citizen of an occupied society suffers the same deprivations and dependence on the caprice of the occupier; yet each frets and reacts with her own patterns of frustration which affect her self-consciousness and her perceptions.Blindness imposes similar restrictions on basic freedoms and self-consciousness. One wants to go places, to see and to understand the wider world from which one is barred, but cannot without assistance. One is dependant on others and therefore lost in a world of uncertainty where most decisions are in the hands of others. This is contrary to the natural instincts and feelings of one’s unconscious birthright – just as one might will, as of one’s nature, to walk, and find one is paralyzed.",

Doing business, for instance, is not the same as administering a dole or charitable distribution, just as rain is not a shower of confetti or spray from a hose. What used to be implied when people said “business is business” was that bargaining, buying and selling, hiring and firing, were processes conducted according to ruthless, unchallengeable rules, in which no concession to weakness, no consideration of personal factors or social interests had any part.

Man has the freedom to choose life or death, the blessing or the curse; and throughout the Bible God pleads with man to follow in the path of righteousness. God was unknown in the world which He had made; men worshipped sticks and stones; they did nothing to enhance His glory; so God looked down upon the human scene and found some men with whom He made a bargain. It is not only prayer that gives God glory but work. To go to communion worthily gives God great glory, but to take food in thankfulness and temperance gives Him glory too.",

Instead, we speak of a person's resolve, determination, or his anxiety, eagerness, and so forth, as the ‘powers’ that move us. Of course, one desires for various reasons to carry out his various intentions but that desire is not a component of the intentions. An intention is, roughly, the course of action that one has adopted, so it has no such components. There are other characteristics of intentions which the mental state idea of intentions does not share. Intentions do not have the temporal characteristics that mental states have, or share the curious context dependency that intentions have. And since, according to the theory, mental states operate causally, it would not be possible for a person to commit himself to a course of action as we ordinarily do when we make a promise or sign an agreement or contract.",

      "title": "Of Formality and Humanity",
      "abstract": "Unfortunately, formality has been diverted from its prime object and has lost its original meaning. Really it has become an irresistible fascination to the modern society. We like formality. We anticipate formality. We enjoy formality. So we praise a formalist and laugh at a less formal or non-formalist who is also called an unsocial or uncultured fellow. In true sense, nobody is absolutely free from the addiction of this so-called social custom. So an individual of any caste, creed, religion or nationality is more or less formalist, and thus he acquires a peculiar character which varies from individual to individual, society to society, etc. Also it changes with time. Human being, therefore, may be described as a born formalist. But this innocent customary behaviour has, by the so-called social tyrants, been converted simply into a torture only. In fact, formality in its limited range is good, but it is more than dangerous when it crosses that limit. Now since formality becomes the root of suffering of man, an individual who does not like to suffer should avoid formality. There is a person who neither accepts nor does he offer gift. So he seldom is afraid of any invitation. But the poor people are always afraid of any invitation. Further, instead of expending much for formality, it is judicious and noble deed as well to spend for the ailing humanity thus to enjoy intense heavenly delight. However, to offer food to a hungry man is not so-called formality but humanity which is very essential for society’s benefit and hence it is cordially welcome.",

      "title": "How the Conflation Of 'Inappropriate' Grief With Guilt Compromises The Sixth Amendment Right To Fair Trial",
      "abstract": "On an imperfect American criminal legal landscape, evidence about a defendant’s inability to appropriately perform grief about and/or towards a victim often colors how judges, juries, and the public understand their relationship to criminality. It is on this imperfect American criminal legal landscape that the subject of this paper—grief performance and its relationship to constructions of guilt—is born.I argue that a real ritual dissonance transpires when an individual loses someone close to them to a traumatizing form of death—that is, in an extremely violent or unexpected way. On the one hand, one’s body finds itself expected to conform to social norms regarding grief and mourning. On the other, one’s experience is so anomalous as to potentially make it unfathomable for them to do so. The resulting grief performance is one that is at once produced by the grieving self to process incomprehensible trauma and recognized by a perceiving community as a social oddity, a ritualized failure incapable of being understood by the surrounding community. Because the community cannot comprehend the griever’s performance, suspicion begins to surround the griever. People begin to realize, “she did not cry”; “she was cold”; “she did cartwheels”; “she spoke on television”; “she spent exorbitant amounts of money,” and so they assume she must have had a hand in orchestrating the death of the person close to her. This process can be understood as creating a “grief-guilt” complex, as improper grief performance produces and generates presuppositions of a person’s guilt.As I demonstrate, the construction of a grief-guilt complex does not live in isolation—if it did, the isolated phenomenon would be theoretically interesting but pragmatically insignificant. Instead, the criminal legal system absorbs the assumptions that a person who performs inappropriate or non-normative grief must necessarily be guilty of a crime. To precisely demonstrate the ways in which this unfolds, I focus on three high profile cases: Amanda Knox, Pamela Smart, and Erik and Lyle Menendez. My analysis draws on the language and affective displays that unfolded in the trials to demonstrate how the grief-guilt complex enters into the courtroom. It also highlights the ways in which media coverage preceding and surrounding the trials helped breed heightened suspicion around each of the defendants in ways that hampered their ability to fully access their Sixth Amendment rights to a fair trial unimpeded by prejudicial biases about grief performance and guilt.",

Even when the dominant religion/ideology provides an answer, an examination of what people actually say and do generally discloses various inconsistences, for example between what they claim to believe and what their actions (notably rituals) suggest that they believe or at least consider possible. In every traditional Buddhist society, adherents are supposed to believe in rebirth, a fate which only those who achieve enlightenment escape, and yet in both the Indian and the Chinese Buddhist traditions people worship and to some extent interact with their dead ancestors and in doing so preserve local pre-Buddhist beliefs and customs. In both traditions there are likewise inconsistencies between what people believe about themselves and what they believe about others, as well as beliefs about how to treat dead parents and how to treat dead strangers. Much in the observable mixture of beliefs and practices may be ascribed to the Buddha himself.",

I can therefore constitute myself as informant and dredge up into my conscious world view whatever anthropologists have never inculcated nor elicited. Sublime: elevated. Up is heaven, gods. That which, in earthly things, speaks of heaven, gods. Beyond the beautiful or ugly in that respect-as the absolute is beyond the relative. The element of fear or discomfort present, but only insofar as that height is beyond norms. Any historicity belonging to the term usually involved with the extent to which sublimity is attributed to nature and/or culture. Beauty/ugliness: of this earth, this life. Depending above all on a canon of taste which is notoriously fickle in that it can change with culture, class, or other stratifications. That which, in things, pleases/ displeases the senses and the mind by creating an order which can be enjoyed intrinsically and does not require reference to utility, though utility is not excluded. Informant bias: Despite the importance of my life in nature, work has always been cultural and thought always obsessed by questions of taste. Am therefore much more concerned with the beautiful/ugly than with the sublime. Before my own personal death of God, associated the sublime not with nature but with culture. The sublime",

      "abstract": "Solitary confinement is portrayed as inevitably torturous. Studies of prisoners reveal a variety of negative impacts including physiological (headaches, heart palpitations), cognitive (impaired concentration, memory loss), perceptual (hallucinations, paranoia), emotional (depression, anxiety), and motor (lethargy, apathy). This constellation of symptoms is sometimes described as solitary confinement psychosis. It is argued that in addition a variety of positive effects accompany successful adaptation to harsh circumstances. These include clarity of thought, heightened feelings of personal accomplishment, and enhanced status among other prisoners. Not all prisoners are destroyed by prolonged aloneness and there are lessons to be learned from the resilient few. The virtues of solitude include reflection, freedom from the constraints of society, and creativity. But even those who survive (or thrive) are diminished as human beings because the denial of company strikes at the essence of personhood. We need the mirroring effects of others to be fully human.",

      "title": "Developing the Ego-Ideal of High School Students",
      "abstract": "The of individuals is the single element found in the personality structure of individuals that either fosters or prevents delinquency and crime; so if our goal in the high school is to prevent delinquency and crime it begins with the development of a satisfactory ego-ideal. It is the basic element in Third Force Psychology that explains the dynamics underlying all human behavior (Cassel, 2000; & Rogers and Dymond, 1954). The specific attributes and nature of an ego-ideal that prevents crime is always intimately related to the particular form of government an individual is expected to live and thrive in. For living effectively in a democracy it has to do with a meaningful configuration of some of the following: 1. First and foremost freedom to be one's self and to break away from dependence on all others, and to be able to make own decisions in a more or less scientific fashion. 2. Second, and equally important, is the ability and willingness to be a team member, playing daily roles in such a fashion that the whole is always greater than the sum of it's parts. It must be recognized and accepted that no team is ever stronger than the weakest member, so that each member must be assigned to make full use of talents possessed. 3. Third, that all individuals are equal and that each and ever one must fully recognize that equality and with full acceptance of the other, but that we are all human beings; each with our own particular weaknesses and strengths; so that in full team fashion one's strengths are emphasized and weaknesses are minimized. 4. Finally, there is the matter of play and honesty in a never ending episode that is always adapted to one's daily life and the conditions that emerge in special situations. Trustworthiness derives almost solely from honesty and fair play, and it is the most basic requisite for success in a democracy. Adolescent Years The adolescent years of individuals are typically associated with growing pains and with change, and the dream and desire of early becoming an adult; as only adults are free to make life choices. The typical high school in a democracy includes our youth between 14 and 18 years of age, the period of adolescence when change is the order of the clay and stability in life is often a dream away. It is during these years when typically the ego-ideal is being formulated and developed, and whether it is acceptable or not is determined by the success or failure of the individuals involved. Assessing the Ego-Status In true scientific fashion the effective fashioning of one's ego-ideal begins with some realistic assessment of the present ego-status of each and every individual involved. This is not to be a subjective estimate by a counselor or school psychologist, but rather the use of sound and effective psychological tests that seek to uncover the attributes that depict such critical elements as: (1) Personal maturity, (2) social integration, and (3) the presence and nature of cognitive dissonance Democratic Maturity The Democratic Maturity Test (DEMO) has been developed for purposes of assessing in scientific fashion the Personal Maturity and Social Integration of individuals (Cassel & Chow, 2000). It is based solidly on the definition of John Dewey for a democracy--The of independent individuals. The personal maturity part of DEMO has to do with assessing the independence factor, and the social integration with the interdependence element in the Dewey definition. Cognitive Dissonance The Cognitive Dissonance Test (DISS) has been developed to assess the presence of cognitive dissonance (unconscious type of hurts) that lie deep in the unconscious, and which are typically created by the presence of personal needs that have not been well gratified (Cassel & Chow, 2000). The purpose of the testis to bring those hurts to the conscious level so that individuals can find ways and means to gratify personal needs responsible for the dissonance. …",

      "abstract": "I see an elision or lacuna in these proceedings, possibly signif-icant: the lack of discussion, in a conference rather inspired to speculate objects in the mirror of medieval works, of the me-dieval origins of the concept and word object. Is this an over-sight, a structural failure of vision to bump into what it ought to see? Or is it a purer kind of non-event, the causeless not-happening of something? Sometimes I get the feeling that what does not h appen is inexplicably powerful, an abyssically negative spontaneity ruling and seducing all existent things from its universal invisible domain. The issue might provide an interesting playground for thinking the objecthood of the inexistent, of what is not there. This is a good limit-problem for any philosophy wanting to relate to reality as constituted by how things are. It is also a question that the medieval, as a zone where a saint recommends preaching to non-existent creatures, philosophers theorize divine alteration of the past, and mystics see nonbeing as an excess of being, is already an-swering.But I prefer not to go there, wishing that I could instead move (or realize that I am only ever moving) like the guild navigator in David Lynch’s Dune: “I did not say this. I am not here.” Instead I will close the event by trying to open it into some avenues of understanding along which the medieval origination of object might lead the way. To find the start of these avenues, imagine a generic medieval intellectual, that is, someone infused with ‘the love of learning and the desire for God,’ encountering contemporary object-orientedness. First the bad news: there is no absolute knowledge, no arriving at the omnipresent center. Then the good news: we really have figured out what everything is: objects. Bad news: objects in-commensurably withdraw, remain irreducible to relation, are never knowable in themselves, so no theosis, henosis, subject-object union, incarnation, soul-body suppositum, eternal in-dividuals, or anything like that. Good news: it is because of the above that anything is happening at all . . . and so forth. May-be the fellow would find relief, like a good bloodletting, in the demotion of his desire from the desire to be everything to a desire to be with things. Perhaps he would despair. Perhaps he would think he was in paradise, intoxicated with the idea that these objects are God. Or perhaps he would object, discover-ing new truth through his own understanding of the word object",

      "abstract": "Emmanuel eloquent on both ethics and eros, though if we had not read him before, we might well be surprised to find the former passionate and unlimited, the latter viewed with no small measure of suspicion and restraint. We might be surprised, too, to see just how firmly the two relational realms are held distinct. In this at his most vigorously anti-Platonic: whereas for the Platonists the most ethical response a deepening of the erotic appreciation of beauty and the beautiful, for ethics must be strictly de-eroticized. contrast striking, even if some strands of Platonism do share Levinas's ethical suspicion of the carnal. From the Levinasian perspective, eros has multiple ethical problems. It is, to begin with, too sensual; it can get stuck in the immanence of the body as object and fail in ethical transcendence toward an absolute and imperative subjectivity. declares, You turn yourself toward the Other as toward an object when you see a nose, eyes, a forehead, a chin, and you can describe them. best way of encountering the Other not even to notice the color of his eyes! When one observes the color of the eyes one not in social relationship with the Other.1 Not in a social relationship, one has no chance of engaging the other ethically. Indeed, Rudolf Bernet adds in his gloss on Levinas's remarks, Apprehending the form of the Other's body instead of responding to the infinite demand his 'face' expresses would be both a theoretical and ethical fallacy.2 Eros intensifies the very attention to the flesh that ethics must get beyond, regarding the face not as the site of inexhaustible responsibility provoked by vulnerability, but as a source - perhaps equally inexhaustible - of pleasure, a site for desire in all of its greed and specificity.3 Transcendence encountered through the face seems to imply a sort of theological incarnation, but Robert Gibbs emphasizes that it important to that the divine not made incarnate, even or especially in the face of the other.4 Rather, the other manifests God's transcendence as the space where the difference opens up.5 That unwavering insistence on difference the source of a deeper ethical problem for eros, one that goes beyond its strictly carnal versions. Erotic engagement can blur boundaries; it perhaps the sort of experience in which we are most likely to say that we lose ourselves, and in this we also lose the sharp distinction between other and self so essential to Levinasian ethics. It true that eros in the flesh cannot fuse bodies altogether, but, as Plato long ago had Aristophanes point out, that doesn't mean that it wouldn't like to.6 For Edith Wyschogrod, too, remaining in the immanence of flesh can be a problem, although she's much more direct about also granting the body no small ethical importance - it may well be ethically central. But for her as for the deeper issue with eros ecstasy, and especially the risk of ecstatic fusion. As she emphasizes, The proximity of eros not the proximity of ethics. What - and what, we gather, she fears as well - is the transfer of the intensities of eros to transcendence because the braking power of another's flesh absent and sheer intensity unleashed. No matter how close bodies may be, one distinguishable from the other, but with the transcendent, boundaries disappear. As avers, with Buber in mind, the mystic speaks to himself in the second person, as if he has entered into God.7 This not to claim that never acknowledges eros at all. As Wyschogrod points out, Levinas speaks movingly of the eros of flesh, the pleasures of the caress, which involves one with the other, the near one, but not the Other of ethics.8 Eros all very well in its place, but that place not an ethical one. There eros, and there transcendence, but for they do not work together. Eros disrupts the ethical, but precisely by overcoming the disruption that a boundary creates. …",

      "title": "7 THE CLAIMS OF SCIENCE",
      "abstract": "There are few employments of life in which it is not sometimes advantageous to pause for a short time, and reflect upon the nature of the end proposed.\n 1 The pursuit of knowledge is one of those in which this occasional relinquishment of the field of action for that of meditation, is especially needed. We enter upon it at a period when the feelings are quick and ardent, when the desire of distinction is strong, and when many amiable feelings of our nature, the personal affection which we owe to our dearest friends, and the reverence which seems almost to be due to their very opinions, impel us to engage with eagerness in a task which the all but universal consent of mankind has pronounced to be useful and honourable. There is not one of these motives of which I would desire to weaken the force. But valuable as they are as incentives to exertion, they obviously constitute an incomplete ground for any systematic devotion of our maturer powers. The claims of the pursuit of science, like all other claims with which we are concerned, must ultimately rest upon some intrinsic excellency or special suitableness of the object. Qualities such as these can alone give to it an enduring title to our regard. I design, upon the present occasion, to consider the claims of science in the light of the principle just stated. More especially, I wish to direct attention to the ground of those claims, in the immediate or implied relations of science to human nature; in its relations, namely, as an answer to some of the distinctive wants of the human mind, an exercise to its faculties, a discipline of the character and habits, [and] an instrument of conquest and dominion over the powers of surrounding Nature. In the present divided state of public sentiment, particularly in this country and with reference to this institution, there seems to be need of such a discussion; need also that it should not shrink from occupying the whole field of the inquiry. To ourselves at least it cannot but be useful to endeavour to form an intelligent conception of what is really implied in the pursuit of science, of the spirit which that pursuit demands, and of the ends to which it points. It is proper to state in the outset, that under the term Science, I include all general truths, discoverable by the human understanding, whether they are physical truths relating to the material universe, or moral truths relating to the constitution of our own nature, or truths of any other kind. And the order which I design to pursue is the following:",

      "abstract": "This article proposes a feasible law for the social sciences asserting that we human beings are not commodities, assets, capital or resources. Mainstream economics and Marxism describe human participation in economic and societal production through a human-commodity framework. Intangible flow theory aims to replace that framework and interrelated conjectures as human capital, human assets and human resources. This theory is not exclusively applicable to capitalist/market organization forms. It suggests that (a) commodities are physical goods, and exhibit known characteristics differentiating them from human-related flows as service or knowledge flows; (b) human work has properties that make it akin to quasi-service production; (c) humans are not commodities, capital, assets or resources; (d) machines can obtain the skills necessary to replace human work or perform novel tasks when previously intangible dimensions are turned tangible (tangibilization); and (e) cash-flows generated or saved by those machines tend to flow to human beings who own or control them. According to this theory, greater attention must be paid to flows of economic material elements that display a relevant degree of empirical precision (e.g., cash and physical goods flows).

      "abstract": "Patriotism is to a nation what egotism is to a person. One has a passionate attachment to one’s idea of oneself, believes virtues arise from that passion, and seeks to act consistently with those imagined virtues. Patriotism is a similarly complex concept that presumes the same three kinds of things have a necessary relationship and together form a unique totality. A passion, love of one's country, is held to produce a virtue, a consistent commitment to an ideal image of one’s country, which in turn produces a pattern of actions, often self-sacrificial, intended to benefit one’s country. Many might feel the passion, but those who most attest to it may not feel it most. Many might give evidence of the virtue, or seek to, but those considered most exemplary may not possess it most securely. Many might act to benefit their countries, but what counts as a benefit, whether an action is to be judged by its intentions or its effects, who is to judge, and by what means are all issues contentious in proportion to the extremity of the circumstances that prompt the action and the drama of the deed. The complexity of the concept cannot be avoided. Conventional use of the word “patriotism” assumes that the action is founded on virtue and that the virtue necessarily arises from the passion, so that if one has the passion, one will have the virtue, and if one has the virtue, one will perform deeds of actual bene.t to one’s country. This complexity of these covertly asserted assumptions makes the concept intrinsically ideological.",

      "title": "Expectations affect the perception of material properties",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Many objects that we encounter have ‘typical’ material qualities: spoons are hard, pillows are soft, and jell-O dessert is wobbly. Over a lifetime of experiences, strong associations between an object and its typical material properties may be formed, and these associations not only include how glossy, rough or pink an object is, but also how it behaves under force: we expect knocked over vases to shatter, popped bike tires to deflate, and gooey grilled cheese to hang between two slices of bread when pulled apart. Here we ask how such rich visual priors affect the visual perception of material qualities and present a particularly striking example of expectation violation. In a cue conflict design, we pair computer-rendered familiar objects with surprising material behaviors (a linen curtain shattering, a porcelain teacup wrinkling, etc.) and find that material qualities are not solely estimated from the object’s kinematics (i.e. its physical (atypical) motion while shattering, wrinkling, wobbling etc.); rather, material appearance is sometimes “pulled” towards the “native” motion, shape, and optical properties that are associated with this object. Our results, in addition to patterns we find in response time data, suggest that visual priors about materials can set up high-level expectations about complex future states of an object and show how these priors modulate material appearance.",

      "abstract": "Words, utterance, gesture, mark-making, ink, nut shells, a peach or a stray button prompt material-discursive engagement. Nothing is taken for granted in terms of knowledge or experience other than a belief that such engagement is a practice, revealing of itself. This article proposes and exemplifies an ‘apparatus’ of such practice, in which the materially embedded and/or physically embodied production of speech, writing, objects and images are intermingled. This practice has evolved through collaboration, within and across successive performative encounters. Through the intra-acting agencies of performative encounter, the material and the verbal are in conversation, questioning the production of knowledge, critically and metaphorically determined as a ‘digestive tract of knowing’. A material engagement emerges that is continuously enmeshed, unravelled and revealed as an embodied tract that surfaces as diagram, apparatus or a conjunction of vertices. In this context, words, whether written, spoken, uttered or as yet unsaid, are interior to the practice. Together and continuously, their shared and formative meanings are mobile, never settling, always productive. Whether critically informed or invented on the spur of the moment, words (including the writing of this article) act as material-discursive fabric. This research-in-action is evident both in the operative engagement and in the subsequent opening of the practice to others, whether as display, text, performance or dialogic example.",

But reducing the ego to intuitive immediacy — anchoring it in mere animality, in the ‘bounds of nature,’ or in ‘natural law’ — would amount to ignoring the fact that the ego is the product of an ever-formative history, indeed, a history that, if it is to consist of more than mere episodes, must avail itself of reason as a guide to standards of progress and regress, necessity and freedom, good and evil, and — yes! — civilization and barbarism. Indeed, an anarchism that seeks to avoid the shoals of sheer solipsism on the one hand and the loss of the ‘self’ as a mere ‘interpretation’ one the other must become explicitly socialist or collectivist. That is to say, it must be a social anarchism that seeks freedom through structure and mutual responsibility, not through a vaporous, nomadic ego that eschews the preconditions for social life. Stated bluntly: Between the socialist pedigree of anarcho-syndicalism and anarchocommunism (which have never denied the importance of self-realization and the fulfillment of desire), and the basically liberal, individualistic pedigree of lifestyle anarchism (which fosters social ineffectuality, if not outright social negation), there exits a divide that cannot be bridged unless we completely disregard the profoundly different goals, methods, and underlying philosophy that distinguish them. Stirner’s own project, in fact, emerged in a debate with the socialism of Wilhelm Weitling and Moses Hess, where he invoked egoism precisely to counterpose to socialism. ‘Personal insurrection rather than general revolution was [Stirner’s] message,’ James J. Martin admiringly observes41 — a counterposition that lives on today in lifestyle anarchism and its yuppie filiations, as distinguished from social anarchism with its roots in historicism, the social matrix of individuality, and its commitment to a rational society. 38Max Stirner, The Ego and His Own, ed.

      "abstract": "In the Discourse on the Origins of Inequality Rousseau summons men to hear for the first time the true history of their species.1 Man was born free, equal, self sufficient, unprejudiced, and whole; now, at the end of history, he is in chains (ruled by other men or by laws he did not make), defined by relations of in equality (rich or poor, noble or commoner, master or slave), dependent, full of false opinions or superstitions, and divided between his inclinations and his duties. Nature made man a brute, but happy and good. History?and man is the only animal with a history?by the development of his faculties and the progress of his mind has made man civilized, but unhappy and immoral. His tory is not a theodicy but a tale of misery and corruption. Emile, on the other hand, has a happy ending, and Rousseau says he cares little if men take it to be only a novel, for it ought, he says, to be the history of his species.2 And therewith he provides the key to Emile. It is, as Kant says,3 the work which attempts to reconcile nature with history, man's selfish nature with the demands of civil society, hence, inclination with duty. Man requires a heal ing education which returns him to himself. Rousseau's paradoxes?his attack on the arts and the sciences and his practice of them, his praise of the savage and natural freedom over against his advocacy of the ancient city, the general will and virtue, his perplexing presentations of himself as citizen, lover, and soli tary?are not expressions of a troubled soul but accurate reflections of an inco herence in the structure of the world we all face, or rather, in general, do not face; and Emile is an experiment in restoring harmony to that world by reorder ing the emergence of man's acquisitions in such a way as to avoid the imbalances created by them, while allowing the full actualization of man's potential. Rousseau believed that his was a privileged moment, a moment when all of man's faculties had revealed themselves and when man had, furthermore, at tained for the first time knowledge of the principles of human nature. Emile is the canvas on which Rousseau tried to paint all of the soul's acquired passions and learning articulated in such a way as to cohere with man's natural whole ness. It is a Phenomenology of the Mind posing as Dr. Spock. Thus Emile is one of those rare total or synoptic books, a book with which one can live and which becomes deeper as one becomes deeper, a book com parable to Plato's Republic, which it is meant to rival or supersede.4 But it is not recognized as such in spite of Rousseau's own judgment that it was his best book and Kant's sentiment that its publication was an event comparable to the 135",

There is a widespread myth (a positivistic view) that information is something in the world that does not depend on people’s point of view and that it is independent of the situation in which it occurs. But information never has fixed significance. The available data is simply the raw material that must be processed. Any particular information element gains significance only from its relationship to other information in the context in which it occurs (Woods, Patterson, &amp; Roth, 2002).

There is a measure of complete arbitrariness in the very nature of any such attempted beginning. The beginning has nothing whatsoever to hold on to; it is as if it came out of nowhere. For a moment, the moment of beginning, it is as if the beginners had abolished the sequence of temporality itself and were thrown out of the continuity of the temporal order. Indeed the actors often register their sense of this fact by inaugurating a new calendar. But the absolutely new is inconceivable. It is not just that it is very difficult to begin with a wholly new start, that too many old loyalties and habits inhibit the substitution of a novel enterprise for an old and established one. More fundamentally, it is that in all modes of experience we always base our particular experiences on a prior context in order to ensure that they are intelligible at all; that prior to any single experience, our mind is already predisposed with a framework of outlines, of typical shapes of experienced objects. To perceive an object or act upon it is to locate it within this system of expectations. The world of the percipient, defined in terms of temporal experience, is an organised body of expectations based on recollection.",

This latter function of architectural design has strong but modifiable effects on social behaviour and users' mood and productivity and, to some extent, design features also affect health and wellbeing. Too often, however, these important sources of influence are ignored or not recognized, despite repeated demonstrations of these effects. While much remains to be done, research has identified several architectural features that appear to be associated with mood and health. Design characteristics or the way space is structured, presence or absence of windows and illumination all appear to affect people. For some features, the relationship to health is indirect (e.g. small, crowded work spaces may result in stress that may in turn affect health) while for other features the relationship to health is more direct (e.g. eye strain from poor lighting, illness from exposure to fumes).",

      "title": "Egosystem and EcosystemMotivational Perspectives on Caregiving",
      "abstract": "In this essay, we consider the motivations people have for caregiving, and the consequences of these motivations for the self and others. We argue that there are at least two fundamentally different views, or motivational perspectives, that people can have about caregiving. Caregiving in the egosystem is viewed as a means for people to satisfy their own needs and desires; although their behavior may appear selfless or self-sacrificing, they provide care because of what they will obtain, or what it means about them. In contrast, caregiving in the ecosystem results from genuine concern for the well-being of others; although such caregiving often has benefits for the self, those benefits are not the primary reasons why people provide care. These two motivational perspectives on caregiving have paradoxical effects; we describe evidence that caregiving in the egosystem, which aims to obtain benefits for the self, actually undermines the support the caregiver receives from others, undermines relationship quality, decreases the caregiver’s self-esteem and mental health, and even decreases the regard the care recipient has for the caregiver. Because caregivers often are unaware of these paradoxical effects, when they feel that their needs are not being met, they can persist with giving care in the egosystem, creating just the opposite of what they really want. In contrast, caregiving in the ecosystem, actually does benefit the self, in the form of increased support received from others, increased self-esteem and mental health in the caregiver, and increased regard the recipient has for the caregiver.",

      "title": "“Ricoeur and the Symbolism of Sainthood: From Imitation to Innovation,”",
      "abstract": "Despite the way we think of saints as belonging to a certain historical period and confronting specific historical obstacles, we tend to see their acts as being universally meaningful, and therefore, that these acts are practices which should be imitated in some manner. However this understanding carries with it a significant difficulty: namely, there is a risk of interpreting the lives and actions of saints as providing rules of conduct to be followed, as if their enactment was an end in-itself. In other words, a simplistic notion of imitation can lead to the problem of voluntarism, where the intention to imitate an action is viewed to be sufficient or equal to actualizing goodness or piety. But there is a further, perhaps more significant problem with this understanding, and this involves how we tend to conflate the performance (or doing) of actions with their meaning. Does an action, especially that of a saint, have a meaning that is identical to its effect? Or, does the action itself produce a sense of meaning that outruns its effect? If the answer to this last question is affirmative, then the actions of a saint can be said to predicate an emergent meaning, that is, a meaning that has not yet been articulated, let alone realized. A saint would therefore be less a figure of convention and more a figure of innovation.\r\n\r\nIn this chapter, I employ Paul Ricoeur’s theory of symbol to show how, beyond the historical specificity of the lives of saints, their actions can be understood to offer new ways of understanding the possibility for being, which I will unapologetically link to the Christian notion of “the New Being.” My discussion will first include a summary of Ricoeur’s theory of symbol, turning next to an application of this theory to saints and the contrasting context of the Prophet in the Hebrew Bible. The chapter will conclude with an elaboration of a symbolic understanding of action in relation to the New Being.",

      "abstract": "meaning can be derived. But it would carry us too far away from our present purposes to discuss these matters more fully. Suffice it to say then that in some very obvious sense, I do not find that I can will my hair and nails to grow and never dream of supposing I can. Nor do I claim these movements as actions. Nor, for the most part, do I beat my heart, as an action; I find it beating on its own, and most willingly consent to it. I can of course stop it at any moment, so it beats only for so long as I consent. We should not, I suppose, call this an action, although it is a move ment which falls within the general scope of the voluntary. And moving up the scale of control, we find that our appetites are susceptible of some control although they have their given com parative strengths. Still these strengths are not fixed once and for all by nature, but to a degree can be indulged or curbed. And so we have a degree of freedom over them although there are just as obviously limits as well. There are bounds beyond which no one can desire to eat more and under which no one would choose less unless he were at the same time choosing his own death. And more conspicuously, the limbs seem to have little or no natural movement of their own, but to be wholly at our voluntary disposi tion, although they too have their natural limits. The eyes can be rolled about at will, following our attention; and attention itself is a voluntary act. Many experiences seem to solicit our attention with a peculiar insistence, such as anything menacing or desirable; but these solicitations must not be understood as compulsory forces, since they express nothing more than a prior, pervasive, and non-deliberative choice on our part to live, to avoid pain, and to pursue the pleasant. A violent and insistent withdrawal of those prior choices reduces to nothing the solicitations of those expe riences. Such a withdrawal is effected by a suicidal choice, or in a disciplined and cultivated apathy. Hence any static morphology of the will is insufficient. What we find in fact is that at any moment when I am choosing, I am choosing upon a basis of other past choices, upon a mass of funded volitions and consentments. A cobbler chooses to drive a nail in the heel of the shoe not simply upon the basis of an isolated decision to pound now, but also upon funded decisions from the past: the promise to the customer yesterday to fix the shoe today, and that This content downloaded from 207.46.13.73 on Thu, 11 Aug 2016 06:02:59 UTC All use subject to http://about.jstor.org/terms",

Some authors as Freud, Bleger, Ciampa and Dejours helped us to focalize the group phenomenon, considering its formation and performance as well as its relationship with the work. We understand that the individual besides attaching himself by material and/or moral ties also does it by unconscious factors. The organization is the ideal of ego that must be reached and which is, at the same time, unrealizable. Therefore, depressive states or feelings of emptiness, anguish and even the planned death (suicide) are present consequences of all these factors. The questions associated to the work belong to the quality of what is considered essentially human. By this condition we brought to the conclusion about the existence of a certain duality by which the work can be changed into suffering and complete anguish or, on the other hand, be the object of loving investment, a representation of the forces that act to the advantage of the continuity of life",

      "abstract": "“Perfection is one … All men are obliged to tend to perfection, to the one and the same kind of Christian perfection, but each one according to his vocation, state in life, grace of God, personal fervour”. The unity in diversity of the spiritual life could not be stated more forcefully than in this quotation from the new book by the American scholar Pascal P. Parente Divine grace, the foundation and sap of the spiritual life, is one—but men are different, and as grace does not destroy, but perfects, nature, its workings will differ according to the different individuals on which it acts. Yet, the Divine Author of nature and grace never works haphazardly. His creation is ruled by Law, a law which has nothing to do with the modern passion for planning, coercion, and equality, but which is an organic order, in which each being is governed according to its nature. Therefore the spiritual life is governed by its own laws. These are, however, more difficult to discover, especially as they, also, have their exceptions, which are always more striking than the normal developments. The subject becomes even more complicated if we consider that, in the spiritual life, the normal term of development, viz., heroic sanctity, is so comparatively rare that it appears almost abnormal. Yet our Lord Himself has made perfection the aim to which all ought to tend: “Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Heavenly Father is perfect!” From this tremendous command—and it is a command, addressed to all, not a counsel, envisaging only the few—there is no escape.",

The absence or insuffi ciency of the theory of mind gives rise to disorders in acquiring the linguistic worldview, inability to decode fi gurative meanings, failure to use langue in order to maintain contact, and failure to speak of language itself, and many more. Autistic people are characterised by the metonymic cognitive style, which uses the potential of the so-called systemising skills. Instead of thinking of other people, what to say to them and what should be said to them, people with autism think of the things that do not require familiarity with the theory of mind and are not as complex as humans.

      "abstract": "We develop a general method to solve models of interactions between multiple and possibly strategic agents. Our model explains apparently irrational or biased behaviors in a person. We argue that these actions could result from several rational structures having different goals. Our main example is a model of three agents, \"conscious\", \"unconscious\", and \"body\". Our main result states that, for an agent whose unconscious and conscious goals differ, the unconscious may influence the conscious, either directly or indirectly, via a third agent, the body. This three-agent model describes behaviors such as craving, excessive smoking, or sleepiness, to delay or dismiss a task. One of the main result shows that the unconscious' strategic action crucially depends on whether the conscious' actions are complementary in time. When complementary, and if the conscious is not sensitive to unconscious' messages, the unconscious may drive the conscious towards its goals by blurring physical needs. When not complementary, the unconscious may more easily reach his goal by influencing the conscious, be it directly or indirectly.",

      "title": "The Concept of Progress: III. The Scientific Phase",
      "abstract": "CIENCE begins when man learns to S measure his world or any part of it by definite objective standards. Theological and metaphysical explanations are the earlier and less critical analogues of the scientific explanations of phenomena. Science views processes from within; it studies relationships among the things themselves. Theology and metaphysics look upon concrete phenomena as extensions or consequences of a personality or of a principle which dwells or obtains outside of the phenomena themselves. Relationships among phenomena are viewed merely as secondary relationships derived from and dependent upon the primary relationships between the phenomena and the external causative personality or principle. Metaphysics and theology do not recognize primary relationships among mere phenomena, that is, the concrete perceptual objects of every day occurrence. Science grew up as an attempt to explain what appeared to be merely secondary and relatively inconsequential-to measure these interrelationships of things. Primnitive man was under the spell of the power of nature; it overwhelmed, oppressed, frightened, or inspired him. It was for him a mystical thing which he felt in the large, but which he did not comprehend in the concreteness of detail. He made his peace with the unseen powers of nature through attempts at propitiation, bargaining, mastering, intimidation, supplication, service-all of which were the methods used by one personality towards another. This was magic. But in it lay the seeds of scientific control. Magic could not give way to science until analysis of the relations of objects had reduced the personality concept of the world in some measure to a mechanistic or quantitative and intellectual, instead of a qualitative and affective, conception of relationships. Magic was based primarily upon a personality conception of the world. Science, or intellectual analysis and quantitative measurement of phenomena, is based primarily upon a mechanistic view of the world and its phenomenal relationships. Thus the growth of science is synonymous with the abstraction of a world of things away from a world of attitudes, or of personalities, of spirits and of powers. This abstraction and isolation of impersonal data away from personality attitudes naturally first came in the world of physics or relatively inert masses. We are just now learning to abstract complex human personalities into quantitative and intellectualized explanations, or to proceed from the qualitative personality to the quantitative mechanistic explanations of human organisms. This same kind of substitution was made rather impersonally for animal organisms below man at a somewhat earlier date, and physiology became a definite biochemical and biophysical science. A quantitative science of human psychology is just being established as behaviorism and sociology is now beginning to emerge from the limbo of affective attitudes and emotional values into the measurement of causes and consequences, or of quantitative correlations. The Greek philosophers of Asia Minor, and later those of Athens and of Magna Graecia, began the process of mechanistic abstraction in announcing quantitative causal relationships among the phenomena of every day life and in the fields of the organization of matter and of astronomy",

      "title": "Putting Away Childish Things: Incidents of Recovery in Tolkien and Haddon",
      "abstract": "AT FIRST, LEARNING TO DRAW is primarily a process of deliberate forgetting. An untrained draughtsperson sees their subject as an entire thing--a chair, a ball, a hand--and commits a visual representation of the entire thing to paper. The results are recognizable, but not life-like; the hand, for example, tends to resemble nothing so much as five flattened sausages arranged around a frisbee. The viewer acknowledges a representation of an abstract category, but there is no link between the final drawing and any specific object. The trained artist, by contrast, is able to look at their subject and see a collection of lines, highlights, and shadows. The functionality of the object, its categorical nature (hand, ball, chair) may be of importance before the drawing is begun, or after it is completed, but while it is being composed, there is only a straight line here that dips down a little before rising into a sharp curve and a little triangle of shadow there with a darker spot right along its edge ... Forgetting the abstract categorical nature of an object is necessary to the production of a faithful rendering of that object. Likewise, a momentary forgetting of the world one stumbles through, half-seeing, on a day to day basis, as the novice artist half-sees their subject, registering only the surface information necessary to categorize that which is seen, is necessary in order for one to see the fresh, unique, and marvelous qualities of the world as it really is, that odd, unrecognizable collection of highlights and shadows that, taken together, produce something somehow more real than the thing itself. In his 1939 Andrew Lang lecture at St. Andrews University, which was later published as the essay On Fairy-Stories (OFS), J.R.R. Tolkien described this re-gaining of the ability to interact with the world as though it is something wholly new and not previously experienced using the term recovery, 'seeing things as we are (or were) meant to see them'--as things apart from ourselves (59). (1) The noted literary biographer Joseph Pearce has asserted that, in his emphasis on separateness and uniqueness, Tolkien reflects two other mostly forgotten elements of Catholic philosophy: the haecceitas of John Duns Scotus, and the inscape of Gerard Manley Hopkins (Pearce 113-115). (2) However, recovery is more than merely Tolkien's mimicry of a previous age's metaphysics. Though it builds on the foundations constructed by Scotus and Hopkins, it transforms the older theories into an aesthetic principle which is widely applicable in modern literature. Haecceitas (quite literally, this-ness) is Scotus's contribution to the medieval debate on universals and individuation. Briefly stated, the philosophical problem concerns whether existence and essence are one and the same--whether, for example, two identical forks from your grandmother's silver service can be said to have a separate (ontological) existence, or whether their shared categorical fork-ness (essence) is the defining fact of their being. The importance of the debate may be somewhat difficult for the post-modern reader to grasp (one may set the two forks next to each other and observe that no matter how interchangeable they are, they are clearly not the same); it is helpful to remember that the medieval philosophers began from a far more concrete relationship to both the Platonic categorical ideals and the idea of the Trinity (three distinct and separate entities inseperable in essence) than is common in this era. Scotus, following, to a certain extent, the thought of the Islamic philosopher Avicenna, posited that each fork possesses two ontological natures: the categorical essence of fork-ness, and the individuative essence of haecceitas, or this-particular-fork-ness. (3) For Scotus, individuation is a logical necessity long before it becomes a spiritual principle (Noone 105-112). Hopkins, however, read Scotus's haecceitas as a confirmation and validation of his theory of inscape, which has distinct spiritual overtones that haecceitas lacks (Coogan 67-68). …",

      "title": "Self-Consciousness and Intersubjectivity",
      "abstract": "NOTHING APPEARS LESS PROBLEMATIC than self-consciousness. Without it, no inquiry seems possible, for how can one seek knowledge unless one is aware of undertaking that quest? Moreover, consciousness of anything other than the self is always plagued with knowing something whose existence cannot lie in the consciousness of it. As Descartes observed, whenever one represents an object different from one's consciousness, it is always doubtful whether that object exists or corresponds with its representation. (1) By contrast, insofar as consciousness of one's self-consciousness is the very being of self-consciousness, the gap between object and representation here seems uniquely absent. Not only is my representation of myself as self-conscious constitutive of my being self-conscious, but nothing prevents that representation from corresponding to what it is about. This privileged certainty, however, generates skepticism regarding knowledge of anything other than one's own consciousness, including other minds. If knowledge of self-conscious is secured by its identity of subject and object, of knowing and what knowing is knowing of, wherever that identity is lacking, cognition confronts the dilemma of bridging a gap that is insurmountable if knowing has no access to its object other than by representing it. The yawning solipsism that attends the privileged self-certainty of self-consciousness is not mitigated by the oft alleged dependence of consciousness upon self-consciousness. To paraphrase Kant, consciousness of any object is possible only if consciousness relates itself to its own representation of the object. Otherwise, the putative knowledge belongs to no one and there is no consciousness of the represented object. If this relation of consciousness to its own representation is self-consciousness, then there can be no consciousness of an object without a simultaneous self-consciousness. (2) The problem with securing this dependency is that the privileged certainty of self-consciousness renders suspect whether consciousness can ever relate to anything but itself. So long as self-consciousness is construed to be primary, it remains doubtful whether there can be any consciousness of a non-self to accompany self-consciousness. The solitary primacy of self-consciousness, however, is just as questionable as is how consciousness can be aware of itself. II To begin with, self-consciousness must presuppose consciousness if to be self-conscious is to be conscious of one's consciousness. In that case, consciousness must be present, relating to an object it distinguishes from itself. Consciousness may always involve self-relation in that consciousness relates to an object only by relating to its own mental content. Nonetheless, in order for this self-relation to involve intentionality, to be about something objective rather than subjective, consciousness must treat its own mental content as the determination of something independently given from which it is disengaged. Without disengaging itself from the same content to which it stands in self-relation, consciousness reverts to a preconscious psyche that feels nothing but its own feeling self, never attaining an opposition of subject and object. For this reason, the relation of consciousness to its own mental content is not equivalent to consciousness of consciousness. Consciousness's relation to its own representation is only part of consciousness, a part that must be accompanied by a relation to that content as something other to consciousness. Accordingly, consciousness does not collapse into self-consciousness. Because mind is enabled to be conscious of something other than itself only by detaching itself from its own mental content, neither self-consciousness nor consciousness can be primary. Just as consciousness depends upon the disengagement by which self-feeling becomes sensation of something objective, so self-consciousness depends upon consciousness as the object of its own disengaged awareness. …",

      "abstract": "Search activity (SA) is the behavioral and mental activity that is oriented to changes of the environment or of the subject's view and approach to the environment according to personal needs without the definite probability forecast of the outcomes of such activity, but with a regular consideration of the outcomes in the process of active behavior. Dream's lucidity (the subject's realization that he/she is dreaming) protects dreamer from awakenings during emotionally disturbing or frustrating dreams, because lucid dreams allow subject to feel separated from the dream events that may cause a feeling of helplessness. Due to such a protection from awakenings that can bring subject back to the frustration in wakefulness, subject can turn in the further sleep to normal non-lucid dreams that are restoring subject's SA in the subsequent wakefulness (activity in the uncertain situation with the feedback between behavior and its outcome). It is the advantage of lucid dreams. Their disadvantage is that due to the separation from the dream events that are in lucid dreams accepted as rationalized dreams, not as real stories where the dreamer acts like in wakefulness, their ability to restore SA is decreased until they are not displaced by the normal non-lucid dreams accepted as real stories.",

      "abstract": "Julia Kristeva's abject is 'a threat that seems to emanate from an exorbitant outside or inside, ejected beyond the scope of the possible, the tolerable, the thinkable.' The abject moves across the borders enacted to maintain our sense of self, disrupting and terrifying precisely because of its reluctance to stay confined within categories. The abject is not easily relegated to definition precisely because it 'beseeches and pulverizes the subject'. Pursuing constantly, avoiding absolute destruction and lingering always on the edges of repression, it is 'a terror that dissembles, a hatred that smiles, a passion that uses the body for barter'. Continuing this interdependency is the fact that the subject needs the abject; it is necessary refuse, defilement shed from the body in order to maintain the controlled borders of the self. Like vomit, purged so that a healthy body can continue to function, or the presence of abject entities in religion so that the safe and correct strictures of belief can be followed, the abject, Kristeva suggests, exists in opposition to and in challenge of everything. Worrying and con fronting, resisting erasure.",

      "abstract": "Were one to be asked to think about well-being, his or her mind would probably wander among images of harmony, happiness or satisfaction. Others might focus on physical health, conjecture on the achievement of personal goals or conceive of well-being by negation: as the absence of illness, negative emotions or worries. Yet, this would be all but a complete picture. It is in fact possible to think of well-being as a far more complex phenomenon: something other than comforting and fleeting emotions, and different from mere individual feelings of joy or vitality. Well-being may be considered first and foremost as a social issue, pertaining to the composition of conflicting values and the fulfilment of collective needs. All the more so, against the background of global phenomena such as climate change and economic inequality, well-being cannot be reduced to a patchwork of good emotions or to the absence of disease or social unrest. The interconnected and quick transformation of contemporaneity calls for a trans-individual and multidimensional understanding of the concept: encompassing the fields of physical, mental, and social health.",

Autonomy in its primary sense is to be understood as the actual living of an autonomous life; autonomy in its secondary sense is to be understood as the capacity to live autonomously. To be autonomous, agents have to meet three conditions: they must possess certain mental capacities, they must have an adequate range of valuable options, and they must enjoy independence from coercion and manipulation. Autonomy should be distinguished from self‐realization, as autonomous persons may choose not to realize their capacities. Autonomy itself, in an environment that supports autonomy, is not similarly optional, as living autonomously is the only way of flourishing within an autonomy‐supporting environment.",

However, because much of human behavior is not reactive, but rather is aimed at actualization-at satisfying intrinsic needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness-his theory is too narrow to account for the range of human responses even to the emotions that he considers. Although one could argue that actualization and development have coping and survival value, the typical interpretation of survival does not incorporate such concepts. Thus, theorists must recognize that the functions of human action are not just coping and survival, but also include development, in order to make room in their theories for self-regulation.",

We argue that people cannot move forward if they do not experience forgiveness. The role of the witness in pastoral counseling is crucial in helping people to forgive and move forward. Forgiveness is not simply a matter of forgetfulness, repression or suppression. Rather, forgiveness presupposes repentance. It is complex and can be very difficult to achieve. Distinctions between pseudo-forgiveness, pre-mature forgiveness and mature forgiveness are made. In some cases of immeasurable human suffering, forgiveness may be impossible. The New Testament scriptures may shed only a little light on the complexity of the problem. We argue that forgiveness cannot stand alone. Forgiveness may be related to power, love and justice in concrete situations in order to be meaningful. When therapy and/or pastoral care fail to deal with power, love and justice, it will also fail to adequately deal with forgiveness.",

My terminology differs from Van Gennep's (1960 [1909]), but my usage is similar to his, for he too was as much concerned with such sequences as he was with single rituals. I refer to rituals and sequences of rituals as “liturgical orders” because I take them to be orders in virtually every sense of the word. First, they constitute orders in the sense of such phrases as “the moral order” or “the economic order” or “the natural order” – more or less coherent domains within which generally commensurable processes are governed by common principles and rules. As such they represent and maintain enduring relations among the elements they include, keeping them “in order,” and thus establishing or constituting order as opposed to disorder or chaos. In so doing they may also distinguish orders of persons, for instance, those “in orders,” such as Benedictine monks, from others. These orders may be ranked, and rank or hierarchy is implicit in some usages. Architects, for instance, speak of elaborate arches composed of four or five orders, one above the other. Further, inasmuch as liturgical orders are more or less invariant sequences encoded by persons other than the performers their performance entails conformity.",

      "abstract": "Well-being is the state of being happy, healthy and prosperous. Well-being or welfare is a general term for the condition of an individual or group, for example their social, economic. Psychological, spiritual or medical state: high well being means that, in some sense, the individual’s or group’s experience is positive while low well- being is associated with negative happenings. Well-being is equated with the experience of pleasure and the absence of pain over time. The less psychological pain an individual is experiencing the more he or she is going to expenence well-being. When someone is experiencing positive well-being they are also experiencing a few other things. It involves a sense of self-fulfilment, which is the feeling of being happy and one is doing something that fully uses your abilities and talents. The feeling of having a purpose in life and connection with others are also contributors to the idea of well-being when people feel as though they have a purpose in the world they feel like they belong. They feel like they matter and it goes back to be idea that we were created for and by a purpose. Mental Health Week in 2015 has drawn attention to a new evidence-based research study that focuses on workers in the entertainment industry. The report found that entertainment industry workers are at a higher risk of experiencing a mental health problem than the rest of the general population. Because of the lifestyle and the hours that people in the entertainment industry actually work, their ability to access mental health services suffers. There is significant difference in the general well-being among male and female students in the field of performing arts. It means that the general well-being of male students is better than that of female students in the field of performing arts. It implies that there is greater negativity, anxiety and frustration among the female students. There is greater stress, depression and competitiveness amongst them affecting their general well being.",

      "abstract": "Our cognitive system has adapted to support goal-directed behaviour within a normal environment. An abnormal environment is one to which we are not optimally adapted but can accommodate through the development of coping strategies. These abnormal environments can be 'exceptional', e.g., polar base, space station, submarine, prison, intensive care unit, isolation ward etc.; 'extreme', marked by more intense environmental stimuli and a real or perceived lack of control over the situation, e.g., surviving at sea in a life-raft, harsh prison camp etc.; or 'tortuous', when specific environmental stimuli are used deliberately against a person in an attempt to undermine his will or resistance. The main factors in an abnormal environment are: psychological (isolation, sensory deprivation, sensory overload, sleep deprivation, temporal disorientation); psychophysiological (thermal, stress positions), and psychosocial (cultural humiliation, sexual degradation). Each single factor may not be considered tortuous, however, if deliberately structured into a systemic cluster may constitute torture under legal definition. The individual experience of extremis can be pathogenic or salutogenic and attempts are being made to capitalise on these positive experiences whilst ameliorating the more negative aspects of living in an abnormal environment.",

      "abstract": "We enter the world with a multitude of needs, entirely dependent on others, and utterly ignorant. But needs give rise to desires, experience remedies ignorance, and we learn to act on our own. Desire is essential for full blooded action: nothing wanted, nothing done. Belief is also essential for full-blooded action, but desire is a ground of action, in a way belief is not. For one thing, we act in order to fulfill desire, but not in order to fulfill belief. I will say more about this, but I want to begin by showing how even basic desires – those not grounded on other desires – can be grounded, and by comparing this kind of basis with that of their counterpart beliefs.",

      "abstract": "Which factors drive creative activity and achievement? Here, we explore this question with a special focus on both core, to a large extent biologically rooted (e.g., personality, intelligence), and surface, more malleable and socio-culturally conditioned (e.g., creative self-concept), predictors of real-life creativity. Using a series of multivariate structural equation models (N = 803), we examined how creative self-concept, lower-level personality aspects, and cognitive ability (divergent thinking and intelligence) relate to creative activities and achievements across domains. Creative activity in certain domains (i.e., science or art) fully mediated the links between creative self-concept, intelligence, divergent thinking, personality, and creative achievement. No cross-domain effects were observed; while creative activity in art predicted achievement in art, it did not predict science accomplishment. Similarly, the activity in science predicted achievement in science, but not in the arts. The structure of the most relevant predictors of creative activity across domains differed. Creative activity in science was mainly predicted by intelligence, divergent thinking and the Intellect aspect of the Openness to Experience trait. Creative activity in art was predicted by the Openness aspect of the Openness to Experience personality trait and creative self-concept. For everyday creative activity, intelligence, personality, and creative self-concept played a more balanced and similar role. We discuss the implications of these findings and propose directions for future research.",

When people engage in these experiences and with these objects they seem to move from a realm of necessity to a realm of higher values and of real freedom, to use a famous image of Karl Marx. Using Hegel’s metaphor of the ‘Sunday of life’ as its guide, the Conclusion responds to this final objection by showing the many connections that tie the realm of necessity to the realms that transcend necessity. Even in modes of being and acting beyond necessity, work remains constitutively significant.",

      "abstract": "Abstract : Well of Fortitude (WoF), introduced by Lieutenant Colonel Dave Grossman in his book On Killing: Psychological Cost of Learning to Kill in War and Society, is the spark of a greater concept that needs to be taken further. WoF serves as the metaphor for self-development and the development of subordinates. Grossman articulates, stamina on the battlefield [is] a finite resource... [under stress] each man draws steadily from his own private reservoir of inner strength and fortitude until finally the well runs dry. Missing in Grossman's concept is what makes up the private reservoir of inner strength and fortitude of an individual. Taking this metaphor further, consider the WoF to consist of an individual's physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual deepness or capacity. Stress of any kind pulls from one or more of these capacities, and when one capacity is drained the others are affected. What is worse, when one capacity runs dry the individual will break, physically, mentally, emotionally, or spiritually. This concept applies not only to combat, but to all aspects of life: in school, in training, on a forced march, or in dealing with one's spouse and family. Just as a gem has many facets, a whole-person has multiple facets. Dr. Stephen Covey, author of The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People and The 8th Habit: From Effectiveness to Greatness, developed the model of the four intelligences. These are physical intelligence, mental intelligence, emotional intelligence, and spiritual intelligence. four intelligences serve as dimensions of the WoF. Leaders should aim to incorporate the deepening of these intelligences within every training evolution.",

      "title": "Intentionality and neuroscience",
      "abstract": "Most, if not all of us, are in practice mental realists: We explain and predict each other's actions by invoking the attribution of mental states. It is characteristic for many mental states to have intentional content, i.e. for thoughts, desires, intentions or emotions to be about dinner, meetings, sunshine, stock markets, elections, and so on. Intentional contents are assigned on the basis of a rational assessment of behavioral (and other) evidence. Many of us also wish to adhere to the notion that invoking intentional mental states does not imply having to commit to dualism, to a ghostly realm of minds and souls which exists over and above the physical world. Specifically, it is widely believed that the investigation of the brain is integral to explaining how the mind works, and that our mental states fundamentally depend on what happens in our brains. At the same time, it is not all that clear that matters of the mind are in any ontological or explanatory way identical to matters of the brain. Hence, it is prudent to neither adopt the notion that mental states are unrelated to the physical, nor that they can be reduced to the physical. Rather, a moderate position between dualism and reductionism is warranted.\r\nThis book both gives a comprehensive account of the way explanation by mental state works and of how representational/intentional properties are related to matters of the brain, i.e. to matters described by physics, chemistry and biology. The former, which takes up the first part of the book, is rooted in major accounts of a scientific model of explanation by mental states as delineated by recent analytic philosophy, such as Davidson's, Dennett's, Cummins's or Fodor's. The latter, which takes up the second part, involves an inquiry into current empirical studies investigating matters of neural representation and the theoretical frameworks which – sometimes openly, sometimes tacitly – come with it. It not only yields a unified account of representation in cognitive and neuroscience, but also relates cognitive and neural representation to mental intentionality, and ultimately endorses the investigation of cognition by neuroscientific methods as a way of establishing a translation manual between mind and brain state descriptions. Specifically, recent “mindreading” or braincomputer-interface studies are considered as examples for this ongoing endeavor. Building on Quine's and Davidson's theories of interpretation, it is shown that such correlational studies in cognitive neuroscience satisfy their criteria for empirically specifying meaning by way of holistic truth theories, thereby producing localized translations. These translations are non-reductive, since they are bound to irreducible principles underlying the ascription of intentional content, but at the same time, they establish strong semantic bonds between mind and brain, honoring widely shared views about a strong constitutional link between brain and mind.",

Social action, which includes both failure to act and passive acquiescence, may be oriented to the past, present, or expected future behavior of others. Thus it may be motivated by revenge for a past attack, defense against present, or measures of defense against future aggression. Social action is not identical either with the similar actions of many persons or with every action influenced by other persons. Thus, if at the beginning of a shower a number of people on the street put up their umbrellas at the same time, this would not ordinarily be a case of action mutually oriented to that of each other. Purely affectual behavior also stands on the borderline of what can be considered \"meaningfully\" oriented, and often it, too, goes over the line.",

Similarly man can envision a life with certain qualities: truthfulness, love, tolerance, peace etc., and can become the being he envisions. To explain in the words of Maslow, “being” is “that which the person is” and “becoming”, “that which the person could be”, Gordon W. Allport can be aptly quoted in this connection. He writes: “If the prejudiced style of life can be learned and certainly it is not innate-then surely the tentative style or in Gandhi's term, 'equi-minded outlook' can also be acquired”.

From jobs turned down to great loves lost, secrets kept and truths untold, people missed and souls unborn, we understand ourselves through other, unlived lives that are imaginatively possible. This book explores the realm of negative social phenomena – no-things, no-bodies, non-events and no-where places – that lies behind the mirror of experience.\r\n\r\nTaking a symbolic interactionist perspective, the author argues that these objects are socially produced, emerging from and negotiated through our relationships with others. Nothing is interactively accomplished in two ways, through social acts of commission and omission. Existentialism and phenomenology encourage us to understand more deeply the subjective experience of nothing; this can be pursued through conscious meaning-making and reflexive self-awareness.",

So the suggestion that dogs entertain idle wishes is, apparently, vacuous, i.e. untestable, or nonsensical.

      "title": "I Would Prefer Not To Design It",
      "abstract": "Unlike a poem or a song, an object (designed and produced) and a space (designed and constructed) are invariably permeated by the power relations that have made them possible. For, regardless of the intention of the participating agents, designs cannot help but convey the values that sustain, justify and prolong the power relations that have facilitated their existence. With this in mind, especially in the case of the new digital technologies, designers, beyond simply offering a final solution, are increasingly concerned with controlling and influencing the parts of the production process where the social, labour and ecological implications determine, more than just the form itself, the ethical and political value of the design. And of all the political aspects involved in the design process, one holds particular importance: environmental conservation. The immediacy of the environmental crisis that faces us begs the question: what if, instead of coming up with new designs, we devise a way to not design? We cease to produce. There are many examples of this. After all, any product, no matter how small its ecological footprint, will always be pollutant if its purpose is superfluous and non-essential. Other cultures and time periods, such as the Japanese culture prior to the 1960s, demonstrate how some products we believe to be essential are in fact contingent and could quite easily not exist at all. Chairs are a prime example of this.",

      "abstract": "ABSTRACTGratitude is a prototypical emotional response when life's blessings come from the intentional goodwill of other people, but many also attribute good experiences to the intervention of God, gods, a Higher Power, or other benevolent spiritual forces. This study investigated the differences between how United States participants (N = 610) experience interpersonal gratitude and spiritual gratitude. Compared to interpersonal gratitude, spiritual gratitude experiences were less often attributed to human action, more often attributed to supernatural beings and circumstances beyond human control, and elicited significantly less feelings of gratitude, indebtedness, and admiration, but greater awe. Participants reported the highest feelings of gratitude when they also believed in a personal God with a benevolent mind. These findings demonstrate the importance of perceiving benevolent agency in evoking feelings of gratitude, whereas experiences that are attributed to more abstract, less personified, or less external entities elicit a different profile of positive emotional responses.KEYWORDS: Godspiritualitygratitudeexternal attributions Disclosure statementNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).Supplementary materialSupplemental data for this article can be accessed online at https://doi.org/10.1080/17439760.2023.2239781Data availabilityAll data and analysis code for this article is available at https://osf.io/5dyhg/Open scholarship This article has earned the Center for Open Science badges for Open Data, Open Materials and Preregistered.

      "title": "The Psychology Of Acquisitiveness",
      "abstract": "Abstract Human and nonhuman animals share an adaptive capacity to plan for the future by acquiring and saving important items, such as food to survive long, cold winters. In addition, humans amass material goods well beyond what they appear to need—a tendency that we refer to as “acquisitiveness.” The current chapter frames our view of acquisitiveness as a typical, human phenomenon that exists across individuals to varying degrees, from a “Spartan” desire to avoid excess possessions or clutter, through normal levels of acquisition, up through the excessive acquisition and retention observed in hoarding disorder. Acquisitiveness is adaptive at most levels but shares features in common with the excessive hoarding of clinical populations including hoarding disorder, OCD, frontal lobe syndrome, and eating disorders. Acquisitiveness appears to derive from multiple underlying instincts, including the tendency to hold on to goods that are needed in the future, the desire to display one’s quality to mates and social partners, and the “nesting instinct” to surround oneself with materials that afford a feeling of security. We summarize this framework and our own work on the phenomenon. Acquisitiveness is an important and ubiquitous human behavior that reflects adaptive instincts, which can nevertheless negatively impact personal finances, emotional well-being, and the environment in ways that we need to understand.",

In Hindu there are several teachings that can be refered to as the ethics for controlling the self. Trikaya Parisudha teaches that life should be directed to reach happiness by thinking, speaking, and doing good. The Sad Ripu teaches the six enemies within self that are to fight, namely desires, greediness, anger, disorientation, drunkness, and envy. Sapta Timira teaches seven things that can blind the mind, namely beauty, rich, intellectuality, family line, youth, alchoholic beverage, braveness.

      "abstract": "Abstract Silence is thought of both as an absence (whether desirable or deplorable) and as a lack (indicating a potentially retrievable deficiency). Each dialectically points to its opposite: a presence in the first case, and a sufficiency or an abundance in the second. Absence relates to concepts such as void and nothingness, and is associated with a non-specific invisible and inaudible state. It may be wordlessly sensed or intuited. Identifying putative absences depends on the epistemologies at the disposal of the student of silences. Lack calls attention to a particular incompleteness that can be named. It entails the political unfolding of a process and possesses a teleological undertow. Silence as absence has a different order of inaudibility. As a form of elimination it is itself patently political. Lacanian radical lack has its own peculiarities. It too is non-specific, pertaining to an underlying Real that cannot be articulated or communicated, and for which inadequate terms of language must be substituted. The defective symbolic representation of the Real stands in for an ineluctable lack, a perpetually inexpressible voice. Removal relates to the erasure, loss, or entombment of what had previously existed and was perceptible—often hiding the act of concealment itself, most commonly found in the palimpsests of changing historical narratives.",

      "abstract": "The perceptions, ideas, and feelings we hold of ourselves, whether consciously or not, are a natural, intrinsic part of our daily functioning. They seem a necessary ingredient of our attempts to sustain a basic sense of identity, or as Erikson (1950) described it, to protect a sense of personal continuity, unity, and social recognition. As such, they make us an individual in the eyes of others as well as ourselves. But they are also the orientating instruments by which we try to bring some coherence to our own life or to set out new directions. For psychologists, self-referential processes retain an intriguing, though somewhat elusive character, which makes it difficult to capture them in a single, neat conceptual and empirical framework. In a sense, the content of such processes seems to typify the person one has grown to be. Yet, in another sense, they constitute the foreshadowing of the person one could become. Moreover, in both cases, as James explained, these processes introduce an element of recursivity in the way we experience ourselves, without totally merging with ongoing mental, behavioral, and social processes.",

Rules always exist separately from the agents in a rule-circle. Whilst the term unofficial or informal rules is widely used, I consider this to be a mistake: informal rules are not real, the term reifies them. Norms are injunctions are constituted by socio-cognitive phenomena. They are learned, mutually understood and located as memories of past actions, in agents' cognitive systems.

At present a victim/perpetrator dichotomy appears to be the dominant paradigm: perpetrators have either been 'mechanistically dehumanized', that is, perceived as unemotional, hard-hearted and conforming and thereby lacking the core features of human nature or alternatively, they have been 'animalistically dehumanized'. In other words they are seen as immoral, unintelligent, lacking self-control and likened to animals. Within sociology and criminology the dominant view is that genocide and other mass atrocities are committed by technologically-lobotomized perpetrators. Somehow the process of rationalization is believed to have transformed these people from emotionally healthy people into hollow soulless shells of human beings or zombies, devoid of a full range of normal emotions. These people are considered bereft of any ability to reason, think or feel, yet ambulant and able to respond to surrounding stimuli. However it is difficult to imagine crime (especially those involving a group of people working together for the duration of a particular criminal activity) without emotions. For instance, there is ample evidence suggesting that both crimes of passion and pre-meditated crimes involve emotional arousal. Furthermore, research in fields such as evolutionary biology, psychology and sociology of work and organizations suggest that emotions are essential for human progress and survival. In addition, emotions help us make the right call in risky and uncertain situations, in other words, the majority of real life situations. There is, therefore, a need to revisit existing assumptions around the role of emotions in mass atrocities.",

The Stoic enthusiasm for the extirpation of emotion is radical in two respects, both of which can be expressed with the claim that emotional responses are never appropriate. First, the Stoics held that emotions are incompatible with virtue, since the virtuous man will retain his equanimity whatever his fate. Grief is always vicious, both bad and bad for you, even when directed at events commonly considered tragic, such as the loss of one’s child. Second, they buttressed this view with an account of the nature of emotion and its relation to value. Emotions are evaluative judgments that are systematically false, because they attribute significant value or disvalue to external things and events beyond an agent’s control— such as wealth, honor, pain, and death— which are merely ‘indifferents’: neither good nor bad.",

For, as has been heretofore more than once remarked, there are many individuals abroad in the world, who are so much more governed by Impulse than by Reason, that they can scarcely be accounted as altogether sane; whilst there are many others, who knowingly surrender the control which they originally possessed over their course of thought and action, to the domination of a fixed idea, which gradually acquires a complete mastery over them (§ 561). It is not the purpose of this Treatise, however, either to discuss the general subject of Insanity, or to attempt to draw the line which separates it from Sanity,—which is no more possible scientifically (though usually not difficult in practice), than to draw a definite line between bodily health and disease.",

Many theories view property from the psychological perspective of the owner, describing how property enables an owner to create or present a self to the world, to enjoy a zone of liberty, to acquire the confidence to participate in politics or economic activities, among other matters. This paper, however, takes particular interest in the psychological states associated with the non-owner — the person who confronts the property of others. Some theorists have described property as a “hawk/dove” or “chicken” game, in which the non-owner takes a dove role, implicitly from fear. This paper argues, however, that the non-owner’s respect for property cannot be explained adequately by fear. Respect for the property of others emerges as a somewhat mysterious psychological state from the point of view of rational actors, but it is nevertheless critical for supporting the institution of property.",

The issue is particularly striking for professions, such as morticians, surgeons, or sanitation workers, in which there is frequent contact with major disgust elicitors. In this study, we study the “adaptation” process to dead bodies as disgust elicitors, by measuring specific types of disgust sensitivity in medical students before and after they have spent a few months dissecting a cadaver. Using the Disgust Scale, we find a significant reduction in disgust responses to death and body envelope violation elicitors, but no significant change in any other specific type of disgust. There is a clear reduction in discomfort at touching a cold dead body, but not in touching a human body which is still warm after death.",

However, Harmony is a ubiquitous principle based on Motivations arise from physiological need to preserve the integrity of the organism, via processes and the ways we process or react to our environment depends on our internal bodily state. For example, if we are thirsty or hungry, the manner in which we behave toward food stimuli differs and biases perceptions, hedonics, cognitions and memory. Motivations drive behavior, while changes in the internal state of the body anticipate, facilitate or accommodate the consequences of motoric action. The result is an individual system in a state of vibrant instability internally that contributed to physical and social interaction with the external environment. The individual make-ups of character and behaviors has emerged out of such patterns of chemical release. The mind is supposed to be a virtual entity, one that reflects the workings of the neural networks, chemical and hormonal systems in our brain. It cannot be localized to particular areas within the brain, though the entire cerebral cortex and deep grey matter form important components. Realization, sensitivity, conduct, intelligence, linguistic, impulse, energy, the urge to excel and intellect of the most complex kind are the product of the wide-ranging and multifaceted linkages between the different parts of the brain. Likewise, anomalies attributed to the mind, such as the spectrum of illnesses dealt with by psychoanalysts are consequences of widespread aberrations, often in the chemical processes within different parts of the brain.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Phronesis, classically defined by Aristotle as knowledge of what is good and what is bad for humans, is best understood as practical wisdom, that is, the wisdom of action. The main difficulties in possessing phronesis and acting on it are that both human goods and ills come in degrees (so that it is hard to tell how much of the one is enough and how much of the other is too much) and that the goods frequently compete with each other (so that it is hard to determine which to pursue at the expense of the other). In the end, phronesis amounts to sound judgment and intuition in identifying the specific goods to be pursued and the ills to be combated in a given context. In the context of psychiatric practice, the goods and ills must be preeminently those for the patient, mainly the goods of mental health and the ills of mental disorder. But in addition to facing competing goods and subtly varying degrees of goods and ills, the psychiatrist also faces both nonmedical goods and ills and other persons to be taken into account—family members, translators, and consultants, sometimes embodying cultural attitudes different from those of the psychiatrist, as well as such nonpersons as their clinics or health maintenance organizations, insurance companies, and governmental agencies. A look at several cases of community psychiatric practice reveals the complexities that require seasoned phronesis for successful treatment.",

The communication occurring between individuals in this way may be very imprecise; conversations may be carried out in gestures without being articulated into articulate speech; but such gestures are not wholly without a distinctive character; indeed, they may function as the inarticulate 'standards' against which a more explicit formulation of their nature can be judged as to whether it is an adequate characterization or not. Situating himself like this, not in a world of objects, but in a world of meanings, clearly involved Vico in a great deal of arduous, imaginative work in preparing himself for his inquiries.",

      "title": "The Development of the Idea of Habit in the Thought of Saint Augustine",
      "abstract": "This study is concerned with Augustine's use of habit ( consuetudo ) to explain man's reluctance to raise his mind to God, and his difficulty in doing good. In the books that will be examined here, consuetudo is nearly always used in a pejorative sense, and can thus be translated as bad habit (be it of a psychological or ethical nature). Habit as a formal instrument of thought was known to Augustine early in his life from a reading of the Categories. There he learned that habit was a quality of a substance, not a substance itself: ‘One kind of quality let us call habits ἕξιϛ and conditions ( διάθεσις ). A habit differs from a condition in being more stable and lasting longer. Such are the branches of knowledge and the virtues . Justice, temperance, and the rest seem to be not easily changed.’ Augustine was also aware of the idea of habit as a second nature ( consuetudo secunda natura ), i.e. a tendency which is created by one's own activity, and which in turn produces effects in a predictable sort of way. This idea was a commonplace of the ancient world, and may have come to Augustine through the professors of rhetoric, who taught speech and composition through the inculcation of good habits.",

      "title": "Educational Implications of the 'Self-Made Worldview' Concept",
      "abstract": "Immersion in a creative task can be an intimate experience. It can feel like a mystery: intangible, inexplicable, and beyond the reach of science. However, science is making exciting headway into understanding creativity. While the mind of a highly uncreative individual consists of a collection of items accumulated through direct experience and enculturation, the mind of a creative individual is self-organizing and self-mending; thus, experiences and items of cultural knowledge are thought through from different perspectives such that they cohere together into a loosely integrated whole. The reweaving of items in memory is elicited by perturbations: experiences that increase psychological entropy because they are inconsistent with one's web of understandings. The process of responding to one perturbation often leads to other perturbations, i.e., other inconsistencies in one's web of understandings. Creative thinking often requires the capacity to shift between divergent and convergent modes of thought in response to the ever-changing demands of the creative task. Since uncreative individuals can reap the benefits of creativity by imitating creators, using their inventions, or purchasing their artworks, it is not necessary that everyone be creative. Agent based computer models of cultural evolution suggest that society functions best with a mixture of creative and uncreative individuals. The ideal ratio of creativity to imitation increases in times of change, such as we are experiencing now. Therefore it is important to educate the next generation in ways that foster creativity. The chapter concludes with suggestions for how educational systems can cultivate creativity.",

      "abstract": "To speak of sensuous geographies as Other geographies is problematic. The senses do not work independently of culture and the sociopolitical implications of cultural identity formations—far from it! The senses are deeply implicated in the ways in which we make sense of the world as social beings: the way we understand or agree to understand—or compel each other to understand—the world. We sort stimuli according to the values or ideologies that govern our perception of reality. Ideas are in this way, literally, incorporated into the body’s perception of the world. We see and hear and smell what we think we see and hear and smell, or what preconceived Ideas of right and wrong, good and bad tell us that we see, hear, smell, taste, or touch. As the body and the sensory apparatus are generally made to operate in the service of shared sociocultural beliefs and political regimes of thought, the sensory world appears more often than not as a material confirmation of preconceived systems of meaning and value investments. Consider, for instance, the way certain smells may carry positive associations in some cultures and negative in others, or the way the perception of colors, like dark brown and light pink (or black and white), may be mediated by pre-perceptual values of good and bad, superiority and inferiority1—or how our minds can instruct our bodies to perceive a certain image or sound or smell or touch as a sensory signal that an abstract border is in operation or has been crossed.",

      "title": "The Social Dynamics of Spirituality and Youthfulness: A Social Interplay Between Disposition and Process",
      "abstract": "Issues and topics concerning spirituality is not new in the social sphere. Many great thinkers in the fields of philosophy and theology have tried to excavate the richness of the topic. Though not new a topic, there are still various avenues in the sphere of spirituality that need to be examined and discovered through intellectual abstraction and practical observation; it is a topic that is ancient yet new, an idea suggesting a paradox of time and permanence. The relevance of spirituality cannot be contained in a specific era nor time frame or even in established social structures because it deals with people and their disposition toward life and a certain desire in their very being for transcendence. In other words, spirituality is all about a person’s attitude towards life and a quest for an existential meaning behind every experience that might be of unequalled value or significance. Hence, spirituality is not static but dynamic in its very being, for as long as man desires to go beyond his present state of being and moves into another manner of existence, spirituality is evident; it manifests itself in that affinity for self-transcendence. The term youth, alternatively, also speaks of a dynamic progressive or regressive movement of the self, outside of its present state of being. This study, therefore, is an attempt to phenomenologically interpret and appropriate the concept of spirituality as an unfolding of existence on the concept of youthfulness not just an ordinary process in the life of a person wherein one becomes open for self-improvement or self-transcendence",

      "abstract": "After a selection from the remarks made by students about their preferen-ces towards writing in the I-mode, the YOU-mode or the ONE-mode, I propose two hypotheses: 1. There is a certain connection between the degree of self-experience and self-responsibility (primary existence) and the choice to speak or write in the I-, YOU- or ΟΝΕ-mode, but apparently it also holds that the choice of one of those modes restricts or elaborates the space a person has to express himself. More generally stated: There is a certain interaction between the way of existence of a speaker or writer and the way of self-denomination in his utterances. 2. There is a certain connection between the degree to which a speaker or writer a) has knowledge about himself and wants to be responsible for his feelings, thoughts and acts; b) guards or unveils his intimacy towards a hearer or reader; c) wants to be involved in or responsible for a process or activity outside his body; and the way he denominates himself or the outside process or activity in his utterances. I give some examples of ways of linguistic alienation, and propose an arrangement of the degrees of alienation in the same way as is done in language for local distances: HERE THERE YONDER SOMEWHERE NOWHERE I I, as a.. YOU ONE NONE (self) (increasing self-separation) (self-ignoring) (self-eliminating) I expect that children with a very sensitive linguistic intuition, draw conclusions about the reliability of adults from the way they use alienation codes; that human beings are or become strangers to one another, or are more attached as friends and lovers by using alienation codes or direct human language; that relational, social and economic victims advertise themselves as potential victims by the way they use alienation codes and do not recognize their potential oppressors by the way they use alienation codes. The main field of linguistic study as human linguistics lies in making clear what the differences are between direct human language and alienation codes.",

      "abstract": "Abstract There can be no happy outcome in the contemporary debate that pits the priority of individual fulfillment against more traditional claims about the distinctive benisons of shared sources of meaning. This is, at least partly, because there are at least two different kinds of human flourishing, each one being raised up by one side or the other as the comprehensive human good. One kind of flourishing involves the distinctive development of what is unique to each individual agent as irreplicable subject. Although the total content of our identities may be ultimately unknowable,1 most advocates of this view allow agents some substantive insights into their personalities—enough, in any case, to give determinate content to notions of self-interpretation. Another kind of flourishing stems from what given communities take human beings to be in some universal sense (given human nature, basic human capabilities, and so on). The successful formation of communally valued character traits is thought to enable participants to fulfill the highest possibilities afforded by that (or any) community’s way of life. Both forms of flourishing represent very significant goods, and both are, in my judgment, indispensable to a nuanced understanding of the fullest human potential. To slight either, as both sides of the contemporary debate slight one or the other, is not only to impoverish ethical reflection but also to falsify human experience.",

      "title": "The Elements of Play: Toward a Philosophy and a Definition of Play.",
      "abstract": "Scholars conventionally find play difficult to define because the concept is com- plex and ambiguous. The author proffers a definition of play that takes into con- sideration its dynamic character, posits six basic elements of play (anticipation, surprise, pleasure, understanding, strength, and poise), and explores some of their emotional, physical, and intellectual dimensions. He argues for a play ethos that recognizes play is evolution based and developmentally beneficial. He insists, how- ever, that, at its most elemental, play always promises fun. In this context, any activity that lacks these six elements, he contends, will not fully qualify as play. Key words: definition of play; elements of play; universe of playPlay is a roomy subject, broad in human experience, rich and various over time and place, and accommodating pursuits as diverse as peekaboo and party banter, sandlot baseball and contract bridge, scuba diving and Scrabble. Play welcomes opposites, too. Play can be free-ungoverned by anything more complicated than choosing which stick is best to improvise a light saber-or fixed and codified, as in those instances when soccer players submit to scrupu- lous ?laws.? Play can take active or passive form and can be vicarious or engag- ing-and so we recognize play in both the spectator and the actor. In fact, at play we may even become both spectator and actor, straining with an air-guitar at a concert for example or sympathetically enacting the motions of the quarter- back's long bomb during the big game.1 We have no trouble recognizing play in the premeditated prank or the instant wisecrack. And then play can be solitary or social-as enjoyed by a woodcarver at his bench or a quilter during her bee. We can find play in the spaces in between, too, as children engage imaginary friends without quite being alone or as gamers play together on the Internet without meeting face-to-face.We can take in play at a glance in these instances, following its course and knowing it confidently when we see it, but observation does not automatically bring us closer to refining the concept. In fact, the opposite seems to be the case: the settings change, the play interval varies, the intensity rises and falls, and then intent and other human circumstances shift and morph. The more we look and listen, the more we feel our confidence slip away. But if our eyes fail us, perhaps the mind can compensate. Can we imagine a satisfying definition, one true of play wherever and whenever there are players and however they play? Can we specify ideal, unvarying, dependable attributes of play?Many thinkers have proposed so, noting salient aspects of play. Gordon Burghardt, for example, in his searching The Genesis of Animal Play (2005), identified twelve characteristics of play. And Thomas Henricks, in his thought- ful Play Reconsidered (2006), noted that scholars have tended to isolate volition, pretending, ordering, seclusion, and secrecy.2 Boil the lists down, and five basic qualities emerge: play is apparently purposeless, voluntary, outside the ordinary, fun, and focused by rules. Identifying the attributes of play like this can prove very useful if we understand them as criteria, and once having so identified these criteria, apply them as standards.Thus, first, play exists for its own sake. Players do not aggressively seek out some other purpose to play. In fact, trying to twist play to an end vitiates it, making it seem less and less like play. Second, players play of their own accord. Third, play is special and set apart. Sometimes players reserve a particular setting for playing, and no matter how different from each other, the field, the stadium, the woods, the rink, the court, and the ring all serve as playgrounds. Fourth, play is fun, a criterion not so simple as it sounds because people can find fun in a dizzying variety of activities. And fifth, players play by rules. Rules are not just for organizing games and making them fair, they keep games interesting and keep games going. …",

      "abstract": "INTRODUCTION:\r\n“Life is a stage with one entrance but many exits”\r\nWill Durant (1954).\r\nSuicide is a psychiatric issue by itself and is also associated with other\r\nPsychiatric illnesses. Though fatal outcomes in suicidal attempts are not seen in\r\nHospitals in our set up, other factors of rescue do play a part in hospital\r\nAttendance.\r\nSuicidal acts with non-fatal outcome are labeled suicide attempts,\r\nAttempted suicides, Parasuicide, or acts of deliberate self harm. These terms are\r\nUsed to describe behaviors, through which people inflict acute harm upon\r\nThemselves with a non fatal outcome. These behaviors are some how linked to,\r\nBut do not result in death.\r\nAccording to WHO/EURO multi-centre study on Para suicide, it is\r\nDefined as An act with non fatal outcome in which an individual deliberately\r\nInitiates a non habitual behavior, that without intervention from others will\r\nCause self harm, (or) deliberately ingests a substance in excess of the prescribed\r\n(or) generally recognized dosage, and which is aimed at realizing changes that\r\nThe person desires via the actual (or) expected physical consequences.\r\nHence, non- fatal suicidal attempts can have different motivations,\r\nVarying from an intention to die or a cry for help. These attempts may be well\r\nPrepared or carried out impulsively. The degree of lethality and the degree of\r\nMedical seriousness thus depend upon intention, preparation, knowledge and\r\nExpectations of the method chosen and sometimes upon coincidental factors,\r\nSuch as intervention from others.\r\nRisk and protective factors are associated with suicidal behaviors in\r\nYoung females, including stressful life events, mental disorders and hormonal\r\nFactors. Risk and protective factors suggest potential pathogenic mechanisms\r\nAnd indicate the need for efficient method to reach these people at risk.\r\nAs per the WHO statistics, in the year 2000, approximately one million\r\nPeople died from suicide: a mortality rate of 16 per 100,000, or one\r\nDeath every 40 seconds. In the last 45 years suicide rates have increased by 60%\r\nWorldwide.\r\nSuicide is now among the three leading causes of death among those aged 15-\r\n44 years (both sexes); these figures do not include suicide attempts up to 20\r\nTimes more frequent than completed suicides. Suicide worldwide is estimated to\r\nRepresent 1.8% of the total global burden of disease in 1998, and 2.4% in\r\nCountries with market and former socialist economies in 2020. Although\r\nTraditionally suicide rates have been highest among the male elderly, rates\r\nAmong young people have been increasing to such an extent that they are now\r\nThe group at highest risk in a third of countries, in both developed and\r\nDeveloping countries.\r\nEttlingers (1964) in his review reports, 1-2% of those who attempt suicide\r\nEventually complete suicide annually. For every single successful suicidal\r\nAttempt 5-10 persons attempt but do not succeed.\r\nMental disorders (particularly depression and substance abuse) are\r\nAssociated with more than 90% of all cases of suicide; however, suicide results\r\nFrom many complex sociocultural factors and is more likely to occur\r\nParticularly during periods of socioeconomic, family and individual crisis\r\nSituations (e.g. Loss of a loved one, employment, honor).\r\nThough there were observations about suicide and suicidal\r\nBehavior in ancient times, the studies on attempted suicide and suicide have\r\nGained impetus in the recent past. Such studies have lent credence to the theory\r\nThat the suicidal state appears to a large extent, a potentially recognizable and\r\nPreventable one.\r\nDue to expansion of the problem of attempted suicide, major research\r\nEffort has been directed towards investigation on the characteristics of people\r\nWho attempt suicide and is given a high priority in suicide prevention. At risk\r\nPopulation for suicide and attempted suicide is a group which has to be\r\nIdentified and intervened to prevent death from this eminently preventable\r\nCause.\r\nThe aim is not only to achieve a fall in rate of suicide but also to\r\nRestore the individual’s mental health, the sources of emotional sustenance,\r\nWhich is necessary for survival and to maintain the dignity of human life.",

      "title": "Ritual kinship",
      "abstract": "Ritual kinship can have both a social and a spiritual meaning, but it is very difficult to distinguish one from the other in practice. In Zell unter Aichelberg in the 1730s, for example, Hans Jerg Bauer was out drinking with Hans Jerg Drohmann, the godparent of his children, when the latter suborned him to murder. Such a tale, combining as it does spiritual kinship, carousing, and threats of violence, indicates that an account of godparentage has to include the complexities of social context and the ambiguities and shifting perspectives that everyday life presents to people. In his testimony, Bauer expressed shock that his spiritual patron would compromise their relationship. He said, “Godfather, you hold my children at the baptismal font and should warn me against such things.” A good point, perhaps, but irony had never characterized Bauer's relationship to his patron and drinking companion before. At least after thinking about it for a long time, Bauer considered that a godfather ought to offer moral advice and example and not lead his dependent astray. A case like this one offers a rare glimpse into some of the values and expectations surrounding the institution of spiritual or ritual kinship and introduces a few of its ambivalences and contradictions. Even the fact that it was not unusual to use the address “godfather” in everyday life is something one can only occasionally document.",

      "abstract": "N CONSIDERING the prevention of alcohol problems r of alcoholism or of any other selected target it is important to establish the meaning and scope of the word prevention. First, in the context of what may be called problems facing a society, prevention always refers to a class of behaviors or actortypes or conditions or things, not just to one unit or item. It is a mass, not an individual phenomenon. Second, prevention refers to such a category only as that category is seriously believed to be a continuing phenomenon, one that will almost certainly persist or recur unless rather striking change intervenes, change which is not expected unless someone does something about it. Third, to be viewed seriously, to have any chance of being worked for with intensity and continuity, prevention needs to be directed against a class of continuing or recurring phenomena which can reasonably be interpreted by a good many people to be extensive, costly and painful. This interpretation cannot merely be applied on a now and then basis or as a sometimes tolerable, if not acceptable, occurrence. Nor can it be widely viewed as an unfortunate failure to achieve some ideal; such an attitude would render the chances of prevention almost nil. An element of intolerability is requisite.",

We imprison and enslave animals, we exploit them for their labor and their skin and bodies, we constrain what they can do and with whom they can interact. Captivity—including physical confinement, social isolation, and chronic exposure to stress—leads to measurable physiological and psychological trauma. Captive animals also suffer the harm of being denied the opportunity to live their own lives, on their own terms. In captivity, animals cannot achieve higher order needs such as exercising control over their lives, making choices, forming meaningful relationships with others, and engaging in forms of play and creativity. Although there might be some reasonable conversation or debate about the appropriateness of incarceration for humans, there is no reasonable justification for incarcerating animals.",

      "abstract": "space is not defined only by disappearance of trees, or by the receding of nature; nor merely by the great empty spaces of the state and the military plazas that resemble parade grounds; nor even by commercial centers packed tight with commodities, money and cars. I t is not in fact defined on the basis of what is perceived, .... It ... relates negatively to something which it carries within itself and which seeks to emerge from it: a differential space-time. It has nothing of a subject about it, yet it acts like a subject in that it transports and maintains specific social relations, dissolves others and stands opposed to others. It functions positively vis a vis its own implications: technology, applied sciences, and knowledge bound to power. Abstract space may be even described as at once and inseparably, the locus, medium and tool of this 'positivity.' (Lefebvre, 1995) Within the landscape of capital flow, marketable social symbols have no specific location in space, even though they are spatial in character. Since these flows are continuous and increasingly global, there are no geographic boundaries that can stop them. These flows do not necessarily dictate the absolute form but the relational one; they are adaptable to various global environments as long as those environments do not interrupt the flow. The cycle of capital has the capacity to transform every space it touches by voiding it out of its local social symbols and preserving the ones that are marketable for a global audience. Some of these operations happen on the drafting boards of designers and developers and is manifested in the choices they make in shaping the landscape. Global capital fails to recognize difference that REPRESENTATION AND SPATIAL INCORPORATION 315 challenges its spatial fluidity; that is difference that is bounded to geography and its respective cultural practices. Global capital weeds those differences, realigns space with the flow diagram, dissociate them from their social and cultural geography and thus become less specific and more exchangeable. Within this framework, social practices that can survive are the ones that can be transported, while place specific social practices are weeded out through daily labor that maintains the flow of capital within space and preserves its abstraction.",

The acceleration of the simple play of signifiers in fashion becomes striking, to the point of enchanting – the enchantment and vertigo of the loss of every system of reference. In fashion, as in the code, signified come unthreaded, and the parades of the signifier no longer lead anywhere. There is no longer any determinacy internal to the signs of fashion, hence they become free to commute and permutate without limit. Under the sign of the commodity, love becomes prostitution – under the sign of fashion it is the object-relation itself that disappears, blown to pieces by a cool and unconstrained sexuality. The very appearance of fashion bears the closest resemblance to ritual – fashion as spectacle, as festival, as squandering – it does not even affirm their differences: since it is precisely the aesthetic perspective that allows us to assimilate fashion to the ceremonial.",

      "abstract": "Access to and control of resources is a major source of costly conflicts. Animals, under some conditions, respect what others control and use (i.e. possession). Humans not only respect possession of resources, they also respect ownership. Ownership can be viewed as a cooperative arrangement, where individuals inhibit their tendency to take others' property on the condition that those others will do the same. We investigated to what degree great apes follow this principle, as compared to human children. We conducted two experiments, in which dyads of individuals could access the same food resources. The main test of respect for ownership was whether individuals would refrain from taking their partner's resources even when the partner could not immediately access and control them. Captive apes (N = 14 dyads) failed to respect their partner's claim on food resources and frequently monopolized the resources when given the opportunity. Human children (N = 14 dyads), tested with a similar apparatus and procedure, respected their partner's claim and made spontaneous verbal references to ownership. Such respect for the property of others highlights the uniquely cooperative nature of human ownership arrangements.",

      "title": "Corpsing; or, The Matter of Black Life",
      "abstract": "Corpsing; or, The Matter of Black Life David Marriott (bio) CORPSING AND SOCIAL DEATH The word \"corpsing\" (verb) signifies a blunder occurring when, in accordance with the performance of a role, an actor is \"put out\" of his part. A role that is corpsed is one that exposes the limits of performance and, depending on the metaphor, denotes the \"death\" of theater, as theater. A role that is corpsed, which is something contrary to the usual performance of a part, is one that evidently does away with an actor's mastery (of illusion) and no more clearly than when the dis-join between persona and part is exposed. Corpsing therefore raises the more general problem of how any kind of performance can proceed or withhold itself from the possibility of blunder when trying to follow certain rules, or at least how any performance that relies on the ability to properly communicate itself to another can do so without, conversely, also revealing that propriety as artificial and theatrical. For example, the fact that when an actor is corpsed he also reveals the necessary demise of their role, or what is most proper to its performance, it follows that the possibility of blunder—often hilariously—has a force and impetus that cannot be easily borne by the normal codes of performance, except in laughter. So too the fact that corpsing tends to produce a kind of infectious joy at the actor's expense, at his or her inability to subdue, or subordinate, the corpse (and its affects) to the governance of spectacle, authority, or ego. But the fact that something so contagious should also compel an actor to give up his part and commit himself to a particular loss of character doesn't mean that we should lose sight of the fact that corpsing is also spectacle. And while I entirely agree that corpsing is usually determined rhetorically as a kind of excess of body over representation, I also insist that the whole scandal of corpsing (its impure force) lies in this spectacle of what happens when the most self-present mastery [End Page 32] (of representation) comes across that which is both unmasterable and unrepresentable. First, insofar as corpsing reveals a discord, it is not clear from the metaphor whether corpsing denotes a failure to repress or the pleasure of failed repression, a pleasure that is also a death. Hence whatever follows from the failure of performance (that is, from performance itself insofar as we understand the corpse to be expressly, if unwittingly, performed) results also, albeit unconsciously, from the pleasures of failure. Hence the infectiousness of corpsing may quite correctly be said to follow from the spectacle of unmastering, because this spectacle depends especially on the failure of any resistance to manifest itself, insofar as the subject gives in to this failure but not without giving up on the persona of a role as I have just defined it. Second, I have said that this failure does not depend on decision or will but on the unconscious nature of performance, and a general consideration of accident and contingency cannot help us at all in the formation and ordering of particular corpsing events. For corpsing to be an event it must resist the very notion of event (i.e., as something ordered by the terms of performance, for it surpasses those terms). We are also ignorant of the actual motivations and reasons of why people corpse—that is, of why orderly forms of communication and performance succumb and fail, and therefore it is better and indeed necessary for what follows on corpsing and black social death to regard corpsing as radically contingent. It seems to be only by a metaphor that the word \"corpsing\" is applied to acting and theater. What is commonly meant by corpsing is a moment by which an actor exceeds the limits of theater and no longer is in command of a role. Corpsing, therefore, seems to have been defined more precisely as the death of theatrical artifice. But corpsing is also evident outside theater; we see it when people fail to live up to or grasp their social roles. Hence the derisive laughter attached to those...",

      "abstract": "Abstract THOSE who maintain the insufficiency of science, as we have seen in the last two chapters, appeal to the fact that science has nothing to say about “ values.” This I admit ; but when it is inferred that ethics contains truths which cannot be proved or disproved by science, I disagree. The matter is one on which it is not altogether easy to think clearly, and my own views on it are quite different from what they were thirty years ago. But it is necessary to be clear about it if we are to appraise such arguments as those in support of Cosmic Purpose. As there is no consensus of opinion about ethics, it must be understood that what follows is my personal belief, not the dictum of science. The study of ethics, traditionally, consists of two parts, one concerned with moral rules, the other with what is good on its own account. Rules of conduct, many of which have a ritual origin, play a great part in the lives of savages and primitive peoples. It is forbidden to eat out of the chief’s dish, or to seethe the kid in its mother’s milk; it is commanded to offer sacrifices to the gods, which, at a certain stage of development, are thought most acceptable if they are human beings. Other moral rules, such as the prohibition of murder and theft, have a more obvious social utility, and survive the decay of the primitive theological systems with which they were originally associated. But as men grow more reflective there is a tendency to lay less stress on rules and more on states of mind. This comes from two sources-philosophy and mystical religion. We are all familiar with passages in the prophets and the gospels, in which purity of heart is set above meticulous observance of the Law; and St. Paul’s famous praise of charity, or love, teaches the same principle. The same thing will be found in all great mystics, Christian and non-Christian : what they value is a state of mind, out of which, as they hold, right conduct must ensue ; rules seem to them external, and insufficiently adaptable to circumstances.",

Alongside the potential harm in blaming anthropology, indiscriminately, a form of public anthropology may be gleaned: a mandate emerges to attend to spaces which presage this furore. The discipline is being ‘re-tasked’ robustly with its own huge remit to avoid damage in the studies of all peoples. This is extended to detrimental spaces that are revealed in academia, structural or evident, for which anthropology must be made to take culpability, particularly so in certain contemporary high-profile incidents.",

      "title": "Through Thick and Thin: Mele on Autonomy",
      "abstract": "Since interest in autonomy, for most thinkers, is grounded in a desire to know the extent to which we limited creatures can approximate this ideal, a balance must be struck between the principle that an autonomous agent must be free to adopt or reject just about any value, principle, or end and the facts of human existence that must temper our desire to honor the principle. For example, since adherence to rational principles is in general the most efficient way to achieve our purposes, there would be something incoherent about goal-oriented creatures like ourselves eschewing entirely the most reliable way of achieving their goals. Hence, autonomous agents cannot choose to be thoroughly irrational. In general, however, as Alfred Mele insists, we must look not to the content of a person's values or desires, but rather to their derivation.' If we possess attitudes or desires that we cannot shed, our autonomy is undermined if they were produced in ways that bypassed our capacities for control over our mental lives, if, in Mele's terms, they were the result of compulsion. Conceding the need for virtually unlimited leeway with respect to content, I would, nevertheless, opt for a thicker conception of autonomy than Mele's. For we need elaborate but slightly on the conception of ourselves as creatures born into a world in which we must make choices, choices that will both form and reflect our attitudes and values. These choices will determine the manner of our engagement with the world and the extent of our satisfaction with this engagement. Whether we choose the life of a social worker or a monk, a civic leader or a recluse, we will be immersed in circumstances and relationships whose nature can fulfill or frustrate our purposes. And just as the heteronomy of a slave is grounded on his dependence on external forces that may potentially thwart his goals, so may the heteronomy of an ostensibly independent person be grounded on the operative force of barriers imposed by his own physiological, psychological, and cognitive limitations.

      "abstract": "Discursive accounts of time tend to focus on a deconstruction of taken-for-granted notions of clock time, restricted to linear measurable units. By contrast the present article examines some of the discourses and practices deployed by managers in their attempts to control time; in the final instance, it shows how time can be a mystery that escapes such managerial pursuits and preoccupations. More specifically, we draw on Levinas’s ideas on time and the ‘Other’, and use two managerial discourses to illustrate how reification (through the use of technological and institutional artefacts) as attempts to control time tend to result in a proliferation of participation but, equally, an insistence on participation may invoke an intensification of control through reification. Reified relationships invariably result in a perpetual return to the Other, or what we have called participation. However, to varying degrees, our participatory mode is not possible without reification. Yet ‘relationships’ cannot be completely delegated to rationally calculating devices, formal institutions, or markets. Cooperation has its source not in reified forms of rationality (nor of irrationality), but in the human encounter with the Other. The organizational, social order is based on personal relations and personal responsibilities.",

Of course, there always exists an ongoing “dialogue” between communities and their healers, but community or “lay” perspectives invariably have lives of their own. It was in recognition of this that sociologists like Freidson, writing of modern Western medicine, attributed considerable importance to a distinction between “illness,” on the one hand, and “disease,” on the other. Illness, Freidson suggested, might be used to refer to everyday or lay understandings of abnormalities of body or mind perceived as salient by those affected or by kin and consociates around them. Disease might be reserved to denote professional (scientific, expert) perspectives on interruptions to health and well‐being. Illness was deemed to be subjective, disease objective: disease, after all, was defined in terms of textbook signs and symptoms.",

      "abstract": "\"Being strange\" as opposed to \"being oneself\" is part of the thinking in all cultures. Belonging to a given culture is actually defined by ones identity and by \"being oneself\". Both concepts--\"being oneself\" or \"being strange\"--are rational and related constructs. Whatever they are confronted with, for most human beings it is self-evident to differentiate between subject and object, between \"being oneself\" or \"being strange\". This explains why thinking often occurs in opposites or polarities, as an either/or. All \"being strange\" has its origins in one's own self. \"Being strange\" becomes most obvious when persons, gestalt or cultures strongly deviate from one's own familiar situation. It is part of man's disposition to be cautious, suspicious of and at distance from everything considered strange and different. That explains his xenophobia feelings and actions. Behind this attitude we can always discover one's wish to preserve the familiar beliefs--combined with an uneasiness to give up one's thinking and behaviour that is proven and routine. It is only by reflecting on our own culture and our own inheritance that we have the possibility to come to terms with our own ethnic identity and foreign behavioral patterns. If we do not try to understand other cultures while keeping our own cultural identity, tensions and violent conflicts will inevitably result.",

      "abstract": "Disgust has been hypothesized to be uniquely linked to violations of a distinct moral domain (called divinity, purity, or sacred) aimed at preserving one's body from contamination with pathogens and preserving one's soul from violations of what is sacred. Here we examined whether the same emotion-core disgust-occurs when witnessing both types of violation, and we proposed a specific method for doing so. In two studies (N = 160; 240), American and Indian participants indicated their emotional reaction to (stories depicting) sacred or nonsacred violations, each either with or without pathogens. Both Americans and Indians felt \"grossed out\" (a term for core disgust) by events with pathogens (whether violations of the sacred or not). They felt disgusted and angered, but not grossed out, by violations of the sacred. For both Americans and Indians, grossed out was never the modal emotion when a sacred violation did not involve pathogens. Results were inconsistent with a focus on any single emotion: sacred violations were associated with several different negative emotions.

Because we are social creatures, dependent, and not simply self-made, we are responsible for aspects of our identities that have been given to us. We may be more responsible for what we choose, but we can be at least minimally responsible for what we do not voluntarily control, but nevertheless believe or desire, when we are not malfunctioning (for instance: we are reason-responsive). This claim is developed by considering how we should think about responsibility and blame in cases of autism, antisocial personality disorder, kleptomania, and schizophrenia.

      "title": "Growing into God",
      "abstract": "Growing into God Nancy Mairs (bio) I am intrigued by the spiritual implications of the perceived distinction between body, a sociocultural construct developed in relation to the demands, aesthetics, and expectations of others, and flesh, the body's raw material, as it were, the locus of corporeal experience. I am no theorist, however, and so such a distinction is moot without an experiential foundation. In my case, both body and flesh are affected by the progressive physical disability caused by multiple sclerosis, and my sense of the holy has unfolded largely in the shadow of that degenerative disease. We are all born flesh, into what my daughter calls the larval stage, but the formation of the body begins early and with varying degrees of intensity (my mother claims to have had me potty-trained at one year, whereas said daughter left her last child in diapers until she was four and a half). I learned the basic behavioral rules according to my social position (don't pick your nose in public, don't allow boys to glimpse your knickers, excuse yourself when you burp, never say \"ain't\" or call anyone a \"stinker\" or refer to \"the trots,\" and so on) but didn't start to fret about my body, its appearance and its functions, until the onset of puberty when suddenly, it seemed to me, everyone was looking at me all the time—and no one was much impressed with what they saw. Nor was I. For the next three decades, I slaved over my body, painting its hair and fingernails, shaving and scenting its various parts, dressing it in pretty clothes, more or less whatever the magazine models and movie stars and my chicest friends were doing only without the dreamed of results. Even though I became an emerging and then a committed feminist, I continued to treat my body, without irony, as an icon of femininity. In terms of flesh, I was miserable much of the time: I menstruated heavily and painfully, I sneezed and wheezed from last thaw to first frost, I developed migraine headaches and later irritable bowel syndrome, severe depression, [End Page 137] and panic attacks, which caused me to spend some months in a mental hospital. Childbirth was complicated by a protracted pelvis and Rh incompatibility. When I was twenty-nine, I was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and began the long, slow transmogrification from a \"body in trouble\" to flesh in extremis. If I have never had much affection for my body, I have downright despised my flesh and tried to get rid of it through anorexia and suicide attempts. Lest these details make my life sound unrelievedly grim, I must remind you that they have been spread out over a span of sixty-six years, during which I have had many joys to balance the suffering. Throughout this span, God has functioned as a significant though ambiguous force. Early on, I knew him as a Father, gigantic and far off in the sky, with whom my own daddy had gone to live, a move that never made sense to me (and still doesn't). Raised a Congregationalist, I sang in the junior and then senior choir and had a collection of perfect-attendance pins from Sunday school, so I learned all the stories, but no one ever taught me how to interpret them. I read the entire Bible in preparation for confirmation when I was thirteen (I was overzealous in most of my undertakings). I began to pray, a lot of please-pleaseplease and not much thank-you, and I had numerous mystical encounters with nature. By college, although I insisted on my belief in God, I stopped doing very much about it. After marrying, I became an Episcopalian and attended church at least at Christmas and Easter. I would say that my faith in God remained immature long after my body reached adulthood. At the time I learned that I had a chronic incurable degenerative disease, I still believed that God could work miracles, and the fact that he would not cure me suggested that he was quirky and mean-spirited, possibly even amused by my plight, not the sort of...",

      "abstract": "Although I have been unilaterally deaf since birth, only later in life have I realized the extent of this handicap and how I can best manage it. The effects of this hearing loss are complicated, being an interplay of physics, psychology, social interaction, etc. Because people are able to adapt, the extent of this “unseen” handicap is underappreciated. Responses by the public to an informative website (http://909ers.apl.washington.edu/∼dushaw/SSD) suggest that this handicap has a universal nature. Obvious effects are the inabilities to locate sound or to bilaterally process sound signals. Less obvious effects are a heightened sensitivity to noise: as masking to a desired signal, as a fatigue factor, as an impediment to mental concentration. The difficulties encountered when talking over the telephone to someone who is speaking in a noisy environment may give one an appreciation of the effects. Even less obvious effects are the long-term social implications of the handicap: the tendency to ignore those on one’s deaf side, the inability to function “normally” at noisy events such as parties, ASA receptions, etc., or a tendency to irritability in noisy environments. In this unscientific talk, I will attempt to highlight issues that may be deserving of additional study.",

      "abstract": "Like all folk art forms, Neo-Pagan ritual has a well-defined set of aesthetics that operates within the community. Different ritual artists also have their own recognizable styles. Because Neo-Pagans are such a diverse group, not all agree on every aspect of ritual aesthetics. Good ritual does not just happen. It takes organization and artistry, as Toraine suggests, to achieve just the right mix of spontaneity and planning that allows for good ritual to happen. In many ways, ritual is a collaborative performance between the director or facilitator and all of the participants. The highly participatory nature of rituals is possible largely because most Neo-Pagans have internalized a similar ritual grammar or structure, and this structure underlies nearly all rituals. Skilled ritualists recognize this tripartite structure and often articulate it as \"beginning, middle, and end\". Other traditions may include practices such as meditation, focusing and sending group energy towards a particular purpose, or the giving of thanks.",

However, when we partake in clothing the body or making decisions on how a body should be clothed, what fit of pants, color of shirt, or style of jacket is appropriate, proper, or necessary, we participate in the activity of dressing. The term dressing, or dress, is more inclusive than clothing. Dressing includes the total presentation of all body coverings (pants, shirts, jackets) and other accessories such as ties or belts, as well as any modifications to the actual body, such as altering the skin or hair through makeup, tattooing, scarring, cutting, or dyeing (Barnes & Eicher, 1992).

      "title": "Personhood and self-identity",
      "abstract": "Abstract An agent will count as a person, by traditional theories, to the extent that they can reason, are fit to be held responsible, enjoy claims of dignity, and can live up to certain ideals distinctive of personhood. The humanoids will meet those connotations of personhood insofar as they make commitments to one another on an open front, projecting a persona that they effectively invite others—and, interiorizing, invite themselves—to rely on: ‘this is who I am’. In order to ‘personate’ in that sense, they must be able to reason, to ascribe and assume responsibility, to be able to claim rights against one another, and to live up to the ideals of the persona they project. The person or personating agent will enjoy an important form of self-identity over time, even as they change and recognize that they change in their public profile. Not only will they be intertemporally connected in the sense that their states at any time—say, of memory or intention—reflect their states at others: say, of experience or performance. They will also be generally connected by sustaining a commitment to a certain stable or evolving persona. In this richer construal of what they are as a self, it will make sense for them to embrace an ideal of knowing themselves and being true to their self.",

      "title": "A Review of Research on Stress among Youth in Hong Kong",
      "abstract": "IntroductionSeveral authors have remarked on difficulty of reaching a precise definition of (1, 2). Generally, it is accepted that occurs when an individual perceives that environmental demands tax or exceed his or her adaptive capacity (3). Stress is a subjective experience that may or may not correspond to behavioral, cognitive, physiological, and/or emotional responses (4). Hans Hugo Bruno Selye (1907-1982), endocrinologist, is considered 'the father of stress,' as he is one who popularized concept of stress. He defined as the nonspecific response of body to any demand, whether it is caused by, or results in, pleasant or unpleasant conditions (5). Originally, response was shown to be useful for system (from a medical perspective), and for person to adapt to changes; however, a tendency to emphasize its dangers has finally prevailed, so that its original function is often forgotten (6). Today, is normally understood as something negative, as a condition to overcome; however, it is difficult to imagine a condition free of any tension. Indeed, as Selye clearly states: is not something to be avoided. Indeed, it cannot be avoided, since just staying alive creates some demand for life-maintaining energy. Even when man is asleep, his heart, respiratory apparatus, digestive tract, nervous system, and other organs must continue to function. Complete freedom from can be expected only after death (7).Stress in adolescenceExisting literature examines several types of stressors that children and adolescents may experience, like personal illness (8), pain (9), parental or family conflict (10), family economic burden (11), parental divorce (12), peer (13, 14), adoption (15, 16), academic (17), and sexual abuse (18). Arnett (19) examined what elements of adolescent storm and stress are most recurrent in writings of psychoanalysts, anthropologists, and contemporary scholars, and identified three of them: 1) conflict with parents, due to adolescents' tendency to resist authority; 2) mood disruption, given that youth tend to be more volatile (referring to both frequency and intensity) emotionally than either children and adults, and; 3) risk behavior, meaning that adolescents tend to be more norm-breaking, or even more antisocial than children and adults, and such behaviors may potentially harm themselves and others.Byrne, Davenport and Mazanov (20) surveyed 1,039 Australian youth aged 13-18 years to examine nature of adolescent stressors. Ten factors emerged: 1) Stress of Home Life: family conflict, parental control, and lack of trust within home situation; 2) Stress of School Performance: school performance, disinterest in school education, and difficulty in keeping up; 3) Stress of School Attendance: difficulty to go to school and attend regularly; 4) Stress of Romantic Relationships: due to difficulty in establishing and maintaining romantic relationships; 5) Stress of Peer Pressure: difficulty within peer group, feeling judged by peers; 6) Stress of Teacher Interaction: difficulty in interaction with teachers; 7) Stress of Future Uncertainty: worries about future and feeling pressure from future goals; 8) Stress of School/Leisure Conflict: tension between school obligations and desire for more free time for leisure and other activities; 9) Stress of Financial pressure: need to find money for buying what one needs/wants; and 10) Stress of Emerging Adult Responsibility: difficulty due to having to take on new responsibilities when growing older. Interestingly, in each case girls reported significantly higher levels of stressor exposure than boys, which is consistent with previous literature.Results from a large study among 7,915 first-year tertiary education students from Hong Kong (11.4% aged 18 or below and 86.4% aged 19-24 years) showed that local students are more likely to suffer from stress, as well as anxiety and depression, than international and local general population, and their peer group (21). …",

Rather, they tend to accumulate and add to the clutter which increasingly occupies specific domestic locations. Indeed, the semi-permanent storage of peripherals may represent an attempt to symbolically delay the acceptance of the obsolescence of objects and to hold onto a sense of the value which they once had. Peripherals, may then, be functionally obsolete to the owner due to the dispossession of the products they once formed an extended aspect of. However, lack of durability or longevity is not their chief failing. Often unused, or little used, and usually being functionally simple, they have the ability to ‘hang around’ interminably.",

These properties make for personal identity and their emergence is the subject of this chapter and the next. Introspectively, we are all constantly aware of the main property upon which this emergent process depends. As human beings we know that we live a rich inner life: that we are in continuous communion with ourselves and that we engage in a continual running commentary with the events going on around us. We are aware of how our inner lives monitor our responses to external situations in which we find ourselves and indeed modify some of the circumstances to which we willingly expose ourselves, be these natural, practical or social. For example, it is doubtful if there is a (normal) human being who is unaware of an internal dialogue which silently voices sentiments like, ‘Isn't he ever going to stop talking?’, ‘Careful, that truck's pulling out’, or, ‘I can't face that again.’ Moreover, we all also know that these are not just idle commentaries.",

      "title": "Aristotle's Forbidden Sweets",
      "abstract": "Aristotle's Forbidden Sweets JAMES BOGEN JULIUS MORAVCSIK I To ACT INCONTINENTLYis to do what one knows or strongly believes is not to be done (NE 1146b25-31).' Is incontinence possible? It is clear that one can do what one knows or believes is not to be done if one does it unintentionally or unknowingly. A man's conviction that champagne should not be spilled on the dress of the wife of his college's president will not prevent him from spilling it on her if he is tripped or if he mistakes her for someone else on whom champagne should be spilled. But Aristotle's question is whether a man can freely and intentionally do what he knows or believes he should not do when he realizes what it is that he is doing. Speaking very generally, Aristotle's answer is that a man may have knowledge or beliefs that have no influence on what he does on a particular occasion. For example, a man who is gripped by uncontrollable anger may fail to recall or consider something he knows or believes and so may act against that belief or bit of knowledge (1146b32ff.). In cases in which a belief or bit of knowledge plays no part in, determining an agent's behavior, incontinence is possible. It is only in cases where the belief or knowledge plays a fully active role in the determination of a man's action that incontinence is impossible (1146b35). Unfortunately, the details of Aristotle's view are less clear than its outline. How can we be said to retain a belief or bit of knowledge when it does not The authors constitute The West Coast Ancient Philosophy Collective. The general lines of this interpretation come from a meeting of the Northern California Aristotle reading group attended by the authors and Alan Code, David Glidden, Richard McKirahan, and Henry Mendell . Details of the interpretation came from comments from J. O. Urmson and extensive discussion with Charles Young, who made so many valuable and helpful suggestions that we offered him honorary membership in the collective, which he declined, saying that he preferred to appear in a footnote. 1 Unless otherwise noted, all references are to passages in the Nicomachaean Ethics (NE). [11:1 112 HISTORY or PHILOSOPHY determine our behavior? Which sorts of belief or knowledge are inactive in the incontinent man? In the Nicomachaean Ethics the most detailed discussion of a case of incontinence and the best place to look for the specifics of Aristotle's account is the following difficult and often discussed passage. [l] Again, we may also look to the cause of incontinence scientifically [physikos] in this way: On the one hand there is a universal belief, while the other belief is concerned with particular things over which perception is immediately authoritative [KvQi(~]. When one belief arises out of these it is necessary [&v~yKTI]in one case for the mind to affirm the conclusion, and with beliefs concerned with conduct [~v 8~ ~(~g z~QCtK~tKCffg] ~ one must act straightway. [1147a~4-28 ] [2] For example, if one should taste everything sweet, and this thing is sweet, being one of those particular things, then a man who is able and not being prevented must of necessity do this immediately. [ x147a28- 31 ] [3] And so, when there is in the mind one universal belief which forbids tasting, and another belief that every sweet thing is pleasant, and this is sweet (and this belief is active), then when desire happens to be present, the one belief tells us to avoid this, but desire leads us to it (for it can move each of the parts). 3 l1147a3t-35] [4] And so it turns out that one acts incontinently in some way under a principle or belief which is not in itself but is only incidentally opposed to the right belief [~ 8Q00~ L6y~] (for it is the desire and not the belief which is opposed). 4 [1147a35 lt47b2 ] [5] That is why animals are not incontinent; they do not have a grasp of universals, but they have only mental images and memories of particular things.

      "title": "75[TH] Anniversary Reprint the Information Environment",
      "abstract": "Every society is held together by certain modes and patterns of communication that control the kind of society it is. One may call them information systems, codes, message networks, or media of communication; taken together they set and maintain the parameters of thought and learning within a culture. Just as the physical environment determines what the source of food and exertions of labor shall be, the information environment gives specific direction to the kinds of ideas, social attitudes, definitions of knowledge, and intellectual capacities that will emerge. For example, there are people, like the aborigines, whose repertoire of communication possibilities consists almost entirely of talking to each other, face to face. The word is never isolated from the body that produces it. There is, therefore, always an immediate and specific context in which meaning is shared. Feedback is never an issue: communication always includes response. This situation gives both their interactions and their thought a high degree of subjectivity, spontaneity, and emotion. But it does not provide an occasion or stimulus for sustained speculation. Without disembodied words there is no disinterested thought. Everyone is, so to speak, an existentialist. Introduce hieroglyphics or, if you can imagine it, a tape recorder to such people and you will alter their information environment, and with it, the sort of people they will be. When a medium of communication has the power to disembody words, to split them away from their original source, the psychological and social effects of language are forever changed. In such an environment, language becomes something more than a mode of communication. It becomes an object of contemplation. One may look at it, as in a mirror, and study how it is put together, with the result that the mind itself may become an object of contemplation. At which point philosophers (not to mention grammarians) must emerge to reflect on reflection and on what might be the connection between language and reality. Everyone may become a Platonist. Or this may happen: Let us assume an aborigine has conceived of a way to chisel a message on stone. The message being more durable than its author, it will become more important than he, and will be read and reread over centuries. In such a situation, we should not be surprised if readers not only dispute the meaning of the message but ponder the meaning of time, and then of mortality itself. It is in fact not uncommon for people whose messages have endured, unchanging, for centuries to become obsessed with time, as were the ancient Egyptians and the Mayans. And this may happen, too: A few will learn the symbols in which the message is encoded, and most will not. Thus, the few will be in possession of information to which the many have no access. The few will have, or seem to have (which is the same thing in this case), enormous and secret powers. Thus, priests will emerge to whom special privileges will be given and in whom there will reside special powers of explanation and authority. And suppose it happens that someone, through accident or design, discovers that messages do not need to be chiseled in stone but can be scratched on a leaf or a reed. To be sure, not a very durable medium but one that can be carried far and wide and with considerable speed. Perhaps then the obsession with time will recede, to be replaced by a fascination with the mysteries of space. Thus, explorers and conquerors may emerge, and messages will tell of things happening in other places but maintain silence on what has happened in other times. I shall not speak here of what may happen if you introduce television to a culture such as ours. What I wish to explore is the idea that the means by which people communicate comprise an environment just as real and influ-ential as the terrain on which they live. And further: that when there occurs a radical shift in the structure of that environment this must be followed by changes in social organization, intellectual predispositions, and a sense of what is real and valuable. …",

      "abstract": "Chapter 8 studies how one experiences otherness (a displacement of social identity) in one's own country (inner exile), facing a fall in status and humiliation (eating what is not edible, suffering from infamy and lack of charity) and, at times, facing 'uncanny' situations. This chapter shows how the dynamic of deviation is soon transformed into a dynamic of humiliation and degradation, and how one tumbles down the social ladder. Making a detour via a debasing form of otherness while staying in one's homeland amounts to experiencing not what is elsewhere but what lies at the bottom, to hitting rock bottom at home. The horizontal dynamic of (external) exile gives way to the vertical dynamic of (internal) degradation, also raising the question of whether one can recover from it. Fall in status, humiliating punishment, refusal of hospitality, denial of charity and dietary degradation posing a threat to sanity are generally experienced when the exile finds himself in a hostile foreign territory. Yet the internal exile suffers from the same dynamic of debasement in his homeland, and there may be certain similarities with facing the sudden appearance of the 'uncanny'.",

      "abstract": "Different Paradigms of Software Agents Applied to Modeling and Simulation of Complex Social Systems Marco Remondino (remond@di.unito.it) Department of Computer Science, 185 C.so Svizzera Torino, 10149 - Italy part on some environment. Each senses its environment and act autonomously upon it. No other entity is required to feed it input, or to interpret and use its output. Each acts in pursuit of it's own agenda, whether satisfying evolved drives as in humans and animals, or pursuing goals designed in by some other agent, as in software agents. (Artificial life agents may be of either variety.) Each acts so that its current actions may effect its later sensing, that is its actions effect its environment. Finally, each acts continually over some period of time. A software agent, once invoked, typically runs until it decides not to. An artificial life agent often runs until it's eaten or otherwise dies. Of course, some human can pull the plug, but not always. Mobile agents on the Internet may be beyond calling back by the user. These requirements constitute for sure the essence of being an agent, hence the definition by Franklin and Graesser (1997): “An autonomous agent is a system situated within and a part of an environment that senses that environment and acts on it, over time, in pursuit of its own agenda and so as to effect what it senses in the future”. And the very general, yet comprehensive one by Jennings (1996): “…the term is usually applied to describe self- contained programs which can control their own actions based on their perceptions of their operating environment”. Abstract The term agent, deriving from the Latin “agens”, identifies someone (or something) who acts; the same word can also be used to define a mean through which some action is made or caused. The term is used in many different fields and disciplines, such as economics, physics, natural sciences, sociology and many others. In computer science, the word is used to define very heterogeneous entities and sometimes is even abused. The main purpose of this work is to investigate various kinds of software agents that could be applied to modeling and simulation of complex social systems. Introduction The concept of software agent originates in the early fifties with J. McCarthy, while the term has been coined by O.G. Selfridge some years later, when both of them were working at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Their original project was to build a system which, given a goal, could be able to accomplish it, looking for human help in case of lack of necessary information. In practice, an agent was considered a software robot that lives and acts in a virtual world. In (Wooldridge and Jennings 1995): ... a hardware or (more usually) software-based computer system that enjoys the following properties: • autonomy: they operate without the intervention of humans or others, and can control their actions; A Simple Taxonomy • social ability: agents interact with other agents (and possibly humans) via some kind of language; Agents themselves have traditionally been categorized into one of the following types (Woolridge and Jennings, 1995): • reactivity: agents perceive their environment and respond in a timely fashion to changes that occur in it; • Reactive • pro-activeness: agents do not simply act in response to their environment, they are able to exhibit goal-directed behavior by taking the initiative. Franklin and Graesser (1997) also try to find the typical features of agency, deriving them from the word itself: an “agent” is 1) one who acts, or who can act, and 2) one who acts in place of another with his permission. Since one who acts in place of acts, the second usage requires the first. Humans act, as do most other animals. Also, some autonomous mobile robots act, for example Brooks' Herbert (Brooks 1990; Franklin 1995). All of these are real world agents. Software agents live in computer operating systems, databases, networks, MUDs, etc. Finally, artificial life agents live in artificial environments on a computer screen or in its memory (Langton 1989, Franklin 1995). Each is situated in, and is a • Deliberative • Hybrid When designing any agent based (AB) system, it’s important to determine how sophisticated the agents' reasoning will be. Reactive agents simply retrieve pre-set behaviors similar to reflexes without maintaining any internal state. On the other hand, deliberative agents behave more like they are thinking, by searching through a space of behaviors, maintaining internal state, and predicting the effects of actions. Although the line between reactive and deliberative agents can be somewhat blurry, an agent with no internal state is certainly reactive, and one which bases its actions on the predicted actions of other agents is deliberative. In Mataric (1995) we read that reactive agents maintain no internal model of how to predict future states of the world. They choose actions by using the current world",

Serendipity deals with grasping affordances, that is, usage potentials, creating correspondence and resonance between environmental and personal factors. Serendipity thus plays a fundamental role in how we discover, explore, and learn, and are creative, in all fields of life; on a continuum from grand discoveries in science (like penicillin) to small curiosity insights and informal learnings we all make in everyday-life micro-serendipity [http://hdl.handle.net/2142/36052]. In line with my poem here on Chance + Choice + Change, I see serendipity as a control clash between perceived non-control (Chance) and perceived control (Choice), often leading to Change in our perceptions and directions in life. Serendipity leading to such changes in scientific knowledge as well as in our everyday life is the result of discovering and grasping so-called adjacent possibilities that are both available and new to us in a given situation [https://www.academia.edu/71056287/Adjacent_possible].

      "title": "EMOTIONS IN THE ORGANIZATIONAL ENVIRONMENT",
      "abstract": "At the heart of any workplace behavior (and not only), there are always one or more emotions (pleasant/unpleasant, partially controllable/uncontrollable, aware/ unconscious, useful/useless/harmful, intense/less intense, predictable/unpredictable, expressed/ repressed, observable/ unobservable, explained/ unexplained, rational/ irrational, and so on). Emotions are the foundation of a complex and mysterious mechanism of action and behavior. Emotions are triggered by certain things, people, events, situations, processes, results, interactions and so on, and are informed by a variety of endogenous (biological) and exogenous factors, and also by the intellectual potential of each individual. Emotions lie at the intersection of rationality, body (physical) and soul (spirit), thought, reason, logic, compassion, autonomy and action/behavior, individual and environment. This article undertakes to define emotions and identify their impact on the organizational environment, with emphasis on emotional climate and managing emotions. Moreover, we will focus on human behavior/action, rather than on the evolution of the nervous system or the cortex in particular. Work itself should not be a source of suffering. It is obvious that certain emotions cause bad moods, unnecessary and even harmful ones, conditions that should be considered, even if they have a situational and subjective character. Some managers think that the decision-maker fulfills his/her duties by strictly conforming to the law and to the agreement clauses and by meeting his/her obligations in a timely and exacting manner. Others believe that a good leader, in addition to observing the applicable rules and regulation, must be honest also to his colleagues and collaborators and sympathetic to the needs, ideas and emotions of those who are interested in the optimal operation of the company. Managers must remain alert to events, people and behaviors that can trigger harmful emotions within the organization. Employees should be encouraged to express their emotions in order to avoid tense situations. Even though tensions may occur, they must be managed effectively because, as we all know, avoiding a war does not mean peace, just as avoiding unnecessary inconveniences does not always equal pleasure. The improvement of emotional behavior represents a competitive edge in business activities for any organization. The main target of this undertaking is to provide a certain perspective on emotion; to be more specific, we are concerned with discovering the circumstances and causes that trigger off emotions in organizational environments. Theoretical approaches conveyed in this article may be perceived as a call to mindfulness and to the managers\\\\\\' awareness as to the importance of improving the emotional climate of the workplace.",

On the contrary, I assumed the fact of a System, and went on to point out some of the consequences which it involved. I assume, not only as incontrovertible, but as more or less confessed by all men, that the various sciences, which occupy the field of Knowledge, have, not mutual relations only, but run towards and into each other, and converge and approximate to a philosophical whole, whether we will or no:—so active is the sympathy which exists between them, so ready is the human mind to recognise, nay so impatient to anticipate, the Principle of System in all matters whatever, even at the risk of investing with laws and moulding into one, materials too scanty or too detached to sustain the process.

      "abstract": "Buddhist identity: a Buddhist by any other name?When we talk about a 'Buddhist' or 'Buddhists' in Canada and the United States, what exactly is our referent—a label or category, an identity, or perhaps something more? Is the term 'Buddhist' signifying a reified object (or subject?), one that subsumes all sorts of practices, beliefs, philosophies, and preconceptions under its umbrella? Or can the term be used to signify choice, personal commitment, motivation, partiality, and perhaps even struggle? We have a great many labels and categorizations of the differences among and between Buddhists, but can we really assume that the term 'Buddhist' itself is unproblematic? Calling someone a Buddhist in the West, or 'naming' them as such, appears initially and on the surface a fairly straightforward undertaking. And yet, the very act of naming itself is a composite of assumptions and expectations. In much of the anthropological literature on initiation rituals, the act of naming has been construed as more-or-less a societal quest for order and control of the individual. Naming marks who is 'in' and who is 'out'. Being named is an important marker of social identity, socialness, and social belonging (inter alia, Jell-Bahlsen 1989; Jacquemet 1992; Cohen 1994).",

      "abstract": "Every human being is part of a particular society and societies are made up of different races, cultures and ethnicities. Society plays decisive role in the identity formation of a particular human being. Human being can’t live life completely dependent on his own persona but needs others to continue the passage of life.  So, for the continuation of the passage of life, socialization is important for the human being, and within this process of socialization an individual can never be isolated in a self-contained environment but must engage in interaction with the rest of the surroundings. Human being needs to have certain societal relations, which in turn will keep him confined within the norms and the established societal set up. But due to certain compulsions, by own will or by any other calamity the established set-up gets dispersed or scattered and then the human being needs some other geographical space to continue the passage of life. This dispersion or the scattering of the people, language, or culture that was formerly concentrated on one place is called Diaspora, (originated from the Greek word “Dia” meaning through or “Speria” means dispersion or sow).

      "title": "Virtues of Theft: Andre Techine's Thieves",
      "abstract": "truth behind this, which we are all so quick to disavow, is that man is not a gentle creature who retaliates only when attacked. Part of his instinctive nature is a large dose of aggressiveness. His neighbor is not only a potential helper or sexual object but an object of temptation. Man is tempted to satisfy his need for aggression at his neighbor's expense--to exploit him at work, take advantage of him sexually, plunder and manipulate him, torture and kill him. It is precisely because your neighbor is not worthy of love and is, in fact your enemy, that you must love him as yourself. Marie LeBlanc/Catherine Deneuve in Thieves Analysis shows that a relation (always social) determines its terms, and not reverse, and that each individual is a locus in which an incoherent (and often contradictory) plurality of such relational determinations interact. Moreover, question at hand concerns modes of operation or schemata of action... an operational logic whose models go as far back as age-old ruses of fishes and insects that disguise or transform themselves in order to survive.... The purpose... is.. to bring to light models of action characteristic of users whose status as dominated element in a society (a status that does not mean that they are either passive or docile) is concealed by euphemistic term consumers. Everyday life invents itself by poaching in countless ways on property of others. Michel de Certeau, The Practice of Everyday Life (xi-xii) ACROSS GENRES AND REPUTATIONS, OLD AND NEW, THIS year's French cinema has feasted on thieves of many varieties. Claude Chabrol's rebellious pair in La Ceremonie are most obvious, stealing clothes or mail for spite, but stealing rifles for firearms, in their protest against subjugation and hypocrisy. Claire Denis' lonely adolescent in her ingeniously impressionistic Nenette et Boni kidnaps a baby that not only brings to life stolen affection of his fantasies but serves as a sign of faith in his sister and their mutual love. In Gilles Mimouni's L'Appartement, an homage to Hitchcock and Hollywood classics, a young woman appropriates her friend's persona--her image, name, and habitat--to steal a relationship with man pursuing her. Claude Lelouch's romanticly stylish Men, Women: User's Manual presents a female doctor who steals and redirects confidential medical information between two patients to retaliate against fearless male connivance that resurfaces heroically. And in Ismael Ferroukhi's L'lnconnu, Catherine Deneuve simply steals a chance moment with the unknown that is pure poetry. The results of all these thefts, real and symbolic, are imaginative and heartwarming. I would like to add to this mere fragment of a list Andre Techine's Thieves (Les Voleurs), which shows us how cinema can serve as a formal model, a parallel process, for our emotional development in life. In mid-1990s Techine is one who appears to be making films more because he had much to say than because he has particularly cinematic ways of saying it. His screenplays, dense with verbiage, are demanding vehicles for some of best French actors today because his characters emerge as increasingly complex with their own inherent contradictions. They are familiar and surprising at once, often baffling but compelling as they steer us into morality mazes of our everyday behaviors. Their depth is all more reason that we are content to view Thieves (1995) as an astute investigation of sociopathologies taken up in best of gangster and detective films, mysteries and films noirs. Yet trying to dismantle Thieves is like pulling angel hair from needles of an evergreen tree: successive attempts at separate branches reveal task to be prickly at best and seemingly futile, given inseparability of fibers from form they cling to and from each other as well. Hardly a person or situation in film is autonomous or insignificant, just as in our everyday world we are constantly playing out, in our various relations, conflicts derived from earlier and adjacent ones. …",

Part 2 of this book describes the good goals that God might be seeking to produce in his Universe—beauty; creatures having knowledge (in a largely internalist sense), having their good desires satisfied, with a free will to do actions that promote each others’ well‐being, being of use to others, and worshipping God. Part 3 shows how the possibility of moral evil, and the actual occurrence of natural evil (providing knowledge of possible good and bad actions, and the scope for good response) are necessary to secure these ends. God has the right to allow some creatures to suffer for the benefit of others, so long as he compensates them in this life or after death. The expected value of allowing the evils in order to achieve the good goals is positive.",

I''ll be concerned in this essay with the way William James understood consciousness. James's struggles with the problem of consciousness provide I believe a compelling example of the pragmatic method at work, the method of trying to keep all the things we need to believe in play at once. This is no easy task since the things we need to believe typically represent the needs of different aspects of human life, of different human practices. There will be the things we need to believe for purposes of doing psychology, for living morally, for making life significant, and so on. And there is no guarantee that the things we find ourselves needing to believe will not compete. Indeed, allowing, even relishing, competition among different beliefs, the constant shifting back and forth, revising, dispelling appearances of inconsistencies, refining, and drawing together various pieces of a view of the world that works, that makes sense, as much sense as can be made from here-and-now, is what makes James such a compelling figure. His modus operandi is as visible in his work on consciousness as anywhere else in his philosophy.",

The final disposition is a profoundly important event, not simply a pragmatic or material process, and its significance is expressed through ritualised performances. The disposition and its rituals are shared and communal, involving ceremonies attended by the deceased’s family, friends, and community, whilst less indirectly the disposition is shared by wider social norms and values around the proper treatment of the deceased body. Although the disposition is common to us all, then, it is also a personalised event in which the particularity of the life lived is recognised. Similarly, the place of interment, whether body or ashes, is named and marked to recognise the individual life of the deceased. Places of interment are thus not only identified, but are also accessible to family, friends and community, for the purpose of ongoing visitation and remembrance.",

Why do they seek literally make their bodies not-matter? anorexia, the repertoire of originating factors delineated by experts complex and lengthy. It includes psychic or attitudinal conditions, familial and cultural factors, and somatic variables. From a Freudian position, Chernin journeys back the beginnings of the daughter's struggle separate from the mother and argues that anorexia s cause be found an inadequate rite of passage from girlhood motherhood. For a woman, Chernin writes, to develop into her full womanhood she must surmount the guilt that arises from her fantasy of having damaged the mother through the force of her oral aggression and rage (The Hungry Self 120). From the Jungian concept of the animus, Noelle Caskey suggests psychic incest as anorexia's cause. Michele Montrelay describes anorexia as a substitute for masculine access castration that offers a way for women bypass the problem of lacking the means represent lack (qtd. Vice 198).

In this respect Deborah Perlick and Brett Silverstein argue that the syndrome is particularly likely affect women who strive achieve traditionally dominated by men and who come feel limited by being female, particularly if their mothers were unable achieve these areas (80). Salvador Minuchin has studied correlations between anorexia and disturbed family functioning. Susan C. Wooley has found sexual abuse an etiological factor.

Likewise, Marcia Germaine Hutchinson attributes the c urrent epidemic the influence of the media. Although researchers are divided as the primary cause of the disease and the most appropriate therapy, they agree on its target: seize selfhood, gain a sense of self or, Kim Hewitt's words, to initiate oneself into a new state (42).

In the world of bibliographic information systems it usually signifies one of the well known universal schemes such as the Dewey Decimal, Library of Congress and Universal Decimal classifications. It also calls up visions of arrangements of books on shelves and/or the ordering of bibliographic entries in files. However, classification is much more than this. Its principles underlie the organisation of the universe and control our ability to function within it. Virtually all types of entities can be classified, be they documents, jobs, museum objects, contents of Web sites, the contents of supermarkets and so on. For the most part, people make use of classification without recognising it or questioning how it comes about. However, the lack of classification in any area affects people's lives and may hinder their ability to satisfy some need or to achieve some goal.

      "abstract": "… Do I have, not merely a self-interested feeling, but also a disinterested feeling of concern for others? Yes – the weal and woe of another touches us directly: the mere happiness of another pleases us in the telling: even that of fictional persons whose tale we know of, or in distant ages – this common concern is so great that it collides with the self-interested feeling. The sense of it is indeed a noble feeling, nobler than the self-interested one. Nobody despises it: everyone wishes for it, though not all have it in the same degree; in some it is great, and the greater it is, the more it is felt as a perfection. It is universal, though seldom so great that it inspires active exertions – in misers, for example, with whom self-interest has become very strong. As needy beings the creator gave us self-interest in our own perfection. As beings who have the power to be of service to our fellows, He gave us a disinterested concern for the perfection of others. The concern for others ranks high, since even the concern for self can be subordinated to it, but not vice versa. The more self-interested, the poorer (at least in thought), and hence the more to be despised. The disinterested feeling for the welfare, etc., of another has our own perfection, not as an end, but as a means.",

These nuclear ideas or attitudes about health, illness and care are culturally patterned and are both conscious and unconscious (implicit). Moreover, expectations of the nature of the patient-healer relationship have implications for medical practice in general and psychotherapy in particular.",

As such, content externalism is severely restricted in both its scope and force. It applies neither to cognitive processes nor to the architectures or mechanisms in which those processes are realized. It does not apply to phenomenal states – experiences of various forms – at least not if the essential properties of these states are phenomenal or qualitative rather than propositional or semantic. It applies to some, but only some, propositional attitudes: those whose content is composed of at least one simple rather than complex concept. And even where it does apply, it shows only that these propositional attitudes are externally individuated and not that they are externally located.

      "title": "Individual Autonomy and a Culture of Narcissism",
      "abstract": "Autonomy, self-determination, self-affirmation, emancipation: all these words refer to an ideal that orients the way in which our contemporary culture speaks about many moral and political problems. The importance of this ideal for us can be seen in the way we accept as obvious a number of ideas that follow from it. Most of us would certainly tend to accept that no universally valid answer can be given to the question of what kind of human life is truly meaningful or valuable and that, because of this, people should be granted as much freedom as possible to pursue a life that best corresponds with their own personal tastes and preferences. Many would go a step further and claim that people should also be encouraged to live as much as possible according to what they have themselves chosen, and that they should give up traditional forms of life and role patterns. One aspect of this cult of individual freedom or autonomy is the idea that we should develop a critical attitude towards anything established, accepted or traditional: every form of power or authority, prevailing moral norms and educational customs, traditional role patterns, etc. A further feature of this is the tendency to describe any improvement in the fortunes of the weak, the vulnerable and the less well off as an ‘emancipation’. The idea that the poor, the handicapped and the elderly should receive more support, assistance, respect and attention is translated by the assertion that they, too, should be ‘liberated’. The ideals that we associate with words like ‘emancipation’ or ‘self-affirmation’ were at one time innovative and revolutionary, but they gradually became established as accepted ways of thinking and thus became part of a new common sense. Nowadays, anyone wanting to be provocative will attain their goal more easily by scoffing at everything falling under the rubric of emancipation than by speaking out in its defence. This fact is characteristic of an ambiguity in our culture. While the ideals of self-affirmation and emancipation enjoy enormous popularity, in certain intellectual circles they are treated with suspicion. At stake here is the general image of humanity associated with these ideals. Thinkers such as Wittgenstein, Heidegger, Lacan, Derrida or Baudrillard have, each in their own way, attacked the idea of the autonomous subject and stressed that people’s most intimate thoughts and desires are determined by something that transcends them: by the language they speak or the culture to which they belong. Rejecting the idea of the autonomous subject is usually one aspect of a more general critique of ideas inherited from the Enlightenment. The question whether and to what extent this critique is justified occupies a central position in many contemporary philosophical discussions, and much of what goes on in contemporary philosophy can be described in terms of the opposition between those who would defend Enlightenment ideals (often indicated by the terms ‘humanism’ or ‘liberalism’) and those who would reject or cast doubt on those ideals. What I would like to discuss here undoubtedly fits into a framework that could be called ‘antiliberal’ or ‘anti-humanist’. However, it is certainly not my intention to criticize humanism or liberalism directly and systematically. In what follows, I will attempt to show that the unity or cohesion suggested by the term ‘autonomy’ does not in fact exist. It will turn out that this term is actually associated with three ideals which are not only distinct, but which are in relations of mutual opposition or tension. In addition, I would like to develop the idea that at",

Spiritual health is not just a component of the wellness of the patients that health professionals serve, it is also an integral part of their own well-being. For J. Sefton and her colleagues the concept of wellness, or optimal health, involves an interdependent balance among five areas: physical, emotional, intellectual, social, and spiritual health. Spirituality, in its broadest sense, independent of matter, and associated with one's ability to interpret fact and human constructs can be readily associated with rejoicing, suffering, or grieving. Spiritual development has been cited as entailing unconditional love while assuming responsibility for one's actions.",

The final category involves physical characteristics that compromise bodily appearance or functioning. Whether voluntarily or involuntarily acquired, abominations of the body can be regarded as a form of deviance. Like the other types of stigma, undesirable physical characteristics isolate some individuals, disqualifying them from “full social acceptance” (p. 1). Everything about the stigmatized person is interpreted in light of the negative trait, so that interaction with the non‐stigmatized is often awkward and uncertain. Tension is manifest in people's tendency to avoid eye contact, make guarded references to the stigma, or avoid everyday words that suddenly become taboo; it leads both parties to consider avoiding or withdrawing from encounters.",

If one means helping behavior, or helping in order to gain subtle self-benefits such as esteem enhancement or guilt avoidance—which is what most behavioral and social scientists mean by altruism—the existence of altruism cannot be doubted. But these definitions trivialize the centuries old egoism-altruism debate. Only by adhering to the notions of altruism and egoism that lie at the heart of that debate do we face head on the fundamental issues it raises about human potential and human nature. The question of the existence of altruism is, at heart, about valuing. Are we humans ever, in any degree capable of valuing the welfare of another, or is our capacity to value limited to our own welfare? It seems we do have the capacity to value another’s welfare.",

      "abstract": "In this article, the subject is considered by the author not as a static object, but as a «project», which is in a state of constant becoming. During the study were obtained the following conclusions: firstly, it was emphasized, that a subject has no predefined essence and that his existence precedes any design or plan. Secondly, it is detected, that a subject constructs its identity not through random circumstances or predefined restrictions of the external world, but through the carried-out choices and own deeds and actions, which manifested in the world. Thirdly, it is installed, that а subject is forced to accept its individual freedom even, if it contradicts his desires or expectations of other people. Fourthly, it is substantiated, that the process of self-identification can be dramatic, as it requires the subject to gap with usual stereotypes and expectations, and also acceptance own individuality and responsibility for its actions. Fifthly, it is accented, that the process of self-identification of a personality involves disclosure and cognition of the essence own «Ego», as a unique and integral structure, which is manifested in the subject’s ability to self-creation, self-fulfillment and self-improvement and in his real possibility to form an image of the future world. Sixthly, it is determined, that absolute freedom for the subject turns into a necessity, which prompts his to responsibility for its existence, choice, actions and deeds. Seventhly, it is allocated, that the subject denies social and moral-religious attitudes to free themselves from external influence, that impede his freedom of choice, which is a reflection of his subjective attitude to any situation. That is in this case we can say that the subject, creating its reality, does not rely on external authority, the existence of which is questionable in the world and is repelled only on subjective choice.",

      "abstract": "Abstract “Wealth,” closely related to the concept of abstract value, refers to the many ways that people create, possess, accumulate, transfer, and store value. Ancient wealth could be stored as material objects: horses, land, and gold tripods. These objects represented recognition from others and promised the perception of worth from other people. Wealth continues to be stored and displayed in similar objects, such as houses, cars, cash, and horses. Contemporary wealth often refers to objects such as capital, stocks, bonds, and treasury bills; even when wealth is completely immaterial it continues to be a means of establishing recognition, rank, and status among people. Life itself, and the time it affords, can signify an ultimate expression of wealth. Time often figures as a possession abundantly held by the wealthy; who spend more of their time away from activities of work or labor, while those without wealth typically labor at more physically demanding and highly managed jobs. Wealth, Adam Smith suggested at one point, referencing Thomas Hobbes, is also power; meaning the power to command or purchase the labor of others (Smith 1970 [1776]: 31). Wealth promises, additionally, the social power to realize desires produced through social recognition.",

      "abstract": "Abstract In this commentary the concept of and term for “Sedatic Hunger” are introduced for a distinct form of hunger characterized by an eating pattern that is driven solely by biological necessity, without being associated with the pursuit of sensory pleasure or psychological satisfaction. Unlike physiological hunger, which leads to satiation and results in satisfaction, or hedonic hunger, which leads to craving for sensory enjoyment but is not necessarily assuaged by satisfaction, Sedatic Hunger represents a neutral, function-focused approach to food. Individuals experiencing Sedatic Hunger treat food merely as fuel, demonstrating marked indifference to taste, aroma, and emotional engagement. In particular, in individuals with depression, restrictive diets, or high-stress lifestyles, approaching food consumption from the perspective of Sedatic Hunger has implications for clinical nutrition and mental health. The Sedatic Hunger Scale (SHS), currently under development by the author, is aimed to allow quantification of this phenomenon and exploration of its relevance across diverse populations. Through recognition of the phenomenon of Sedatic Hunger, our understanding of eating behaviors may be expanded and interventions developed for individuals who experience eating as an obligatory task rather than a pleasurable activity.",

A sociable robot should not expect that the human will always follow the exact trajectory of the robot or will always maintain a fixed distance with robot. Moreover human can choose either to accompany or to follow the robot during the guiding. Robot should also not expect that human will always support the guiding. Human may temporarily suspend the joint commitment of guiding process, due to other interesting tasks and may completely abandon the path expected by robot. As a 'social' guide, robot should not only tolerate human diverse behaviors but also try to adapt its path to support the human activity as well as influence the human path towards the goal. It should take appropriate decision about when, where and how to deviate, as the very frequent or unnatural maneuvers of robot will make the human feel uncomfortable. In this paper we present a framework of monitoring and adapting to the human commitment on the joint task, and carrying out appropriate and goal oriented re-engagement attempts, if required, from the view point of guiding.",

For Levinas, to be a subject is not only to be always and already with others, but more importantly, it is to be for others in such a way that the relation between the self and the other is not played out on a plane of intersubjectivity where the other and the self would stand on level ground as equals. I am not the equal of the other, nor is the other person another similar to myself. Such a relation in which it is a matter of the mutuality and the reciprocity of the same, as found in Buber, is criticised by Levinas. The relation with the other person is a relation which lacks symmetry. There is no level playing field; the other person occupies a higher position than I do, even though he or she is often encountered in his or her destitution. Height is a moral quality before ever geometrical space comes into play.",

      "title": "Balance and Falls among Older People",
      "abstract": "An increasing body of clinical and basic research acknowledges the functional decline of sensory and integrative systems in older adults and associates impairments in these systems with an increase in falls. The risk of falls underscores the importance of the of the older adult to be able to receive and integrate sensory information and to take appropriate action to avoid falling. BALANCE, THE SIXTH SENSE What does a complaint of feeling off-balance mean? The complaint could refer to an unwanted interaction of prescribed or over-the-counter medications and herbal remedies, an underlying cardiovascular problem, or age-related or disease-related declines in the balance system. Balance instability is a marker of fall risk and frailty. Balance is the ability of the person to remain in equilibrium and to orient to gravity, the support surface, and to objects in the environment when performing routine activities of daily living (Newton, 2002). Balance could also be described as the to maintain one's lifestyle without falling. Balance is needed when standing or sitting still and when moving in the environment. Anticipatory balance responses precede movements such as raising the arm up to comb one's hair, reaching for an object on a high shelf, or putting dishes in the dishwasher. Older adults with balance dysfunction due to age-related declines or other problems might hold on to the sink in order to perform these routine tasks. Holding on to an object or a person to avoid falling may be a good strategy, providing the object or person is stable. Compensatory balance responses occur in reaction to an external event such as being pushed or tripping over an obstacle. Compensatory balance responses are automatic, occur within 90 milliseconds, and help the individual maintain or regain balance following the perturbing event. The three most important sensory systems responsible for good balance are the visual system, the vestibular system (involving the inner ear), and the somatosensory system (a complex collection of sensors that transmit information about the state of the body and its immediate environment). For example, the somatosensory receptors located in the legs and feet provide information about the condition of the support surface-slippery floor, high pile rug. Receptors (called proprioceptors because they respond to stimuli within an organism) located in the neck and trunk provide information about the alignment of the back and head. Vision provides information about the location and dimension of objects in the environment and the condition of the support surface and lighting. The vestibular receptors in the inner ear provide information about the position of the person in space-moving, turning, and tilting. Many age-related changes that affect balance occur gradually, permitting older adults to compensate until they reach a critical point that results in balance instability. These age-related changes include a decrease in the sensitivity of the sensory receptors that monitor information, a slowing of the nervous system capabilities, and muscle weakness due to inactivity. Gradual declines in these systems also occur with disease. For example, peripheral diabetic neuropathy in patients with Alzheimer's disease increases the risk of falls. Older adults tend to place greater reliance on the visual system to compensate for age or disease-related reductions in the vestibular or somatosensory system, even when visual information is misleading. Relying on one sensory system is problematic; adults over the age of 65 with visual impairments are at least three times more likely than unimpaired adults to have difficulty with mobility, for example in walking, going outside, and performing routine daily activities (Maino, 1996). Wearing bifocal or trifocal or progressive lenses affects the capability to detect environmental hazards by impairing contrast sensitivity and depth perception. …",

The fact that, in the widespread dimension of the glocal interactivity of networks, the individual or rather his naked can relate directly with their own flesh offers a perspective that is radically anti-sapiential. Anti theoretical. Anti-dialectics. Anti-design. The physiological perception of dark matter does not follow but precedes the rational and instrumental dimension of thinking: it involves the most uncontrollable and automatic animal instincts of human beings. Pornography promotes the anti-humanist vision of person and its centrality has to be considered as the ground on which to operate the only move that can show what it would take to stop the crisis of vocation, and consequently of reputation of the ruling classes: with no vocation professions are bound to the existent.",

Now although St. Paul admits, especially in practical matters and in doubtful cases, the decisive power of conscience, and although he is ready to grant that a man may be in good faith, yet, at the same time, in error, still he does not teach that everything which proceeds from conscience is really the voice of God, but only that which proceeds from conscience duly and properly instructed. At one and the same time, St. Paul recognizes in conscience a certain autonomy and yet he also realizes the obligation upon conscience of watching over its motives. Now without pretending that the Dominican conscience differs from that of other men, I maintain that there is a special note, a Dominican accent, so to speak, in its dictates.",

What has prevented the expansion of the golden rule: »Love your fellow as yourself: I am the LORD« (Lev 19,18) and »That which is hateful to you do not do to another« (BT Shabbat 31a:6; JT Nedarim 30b:1) to animals? Why is it that the moral responsibility for the fellow-man, the neighbor, or the other, has been understood as referring only to a human companion? Does the demand for absolute moral responsibility spoken from the face of the other, which Emmanuel Levinas emphasized in his ethics, not radiate from the face of the non-human other as well? Levinas’s ethics explicitly negates the principle of reciprocity and moral symmetry: The ›I‹ is committed to the other, regardless of the other’s attitude towards him. Does the affinity to the eternal Thou which Martin Buber also discovers in plants and animals not require a paradigmatic change in the attitude towards animals?",

They can be bestowed by ceremony, or assumed with the invisibility of the taken-for-granted. But it is the interaction of minds that creates and sustains a role: a role is a human construct. Even roles like “mother” or “father”, which would seem to demand certain biological characteristics, cannot be defined at any depth without appeal to social convention. The largely hands-off approach taken by nature seems to work fairly well for groups of humans: when there is confusion or concern about who is playing what role, it is generally good for a group to work it out as a social issue. If roles were encoded solely in human biology or in physical law, life might be simpler but certainly more stulfiying.",

      "title": "Identiﬁcation of Signatures",
      "abstract": "When a person signs his or her name, he or she is carrying out one of the most common writing acts. With time and usage, a signature can become highly individualized, often in a style quite distinct from that of the writer's other handwriting. The complexity and consistency of an individual's signature does not reflect his or her education or intelligence. How each person writes depends upon the combined effect of a number of factors. Most marginally educated individuals produce a deliberate, awkward signature, lacking in skilland freedom, but nonetheless individual to the writer. With more proficient writers, the entire makeup of the signature assumes greater skill, movement becomes less primitive and elementary, and many letter designs approximate, to a greater or lesser degree, the copybook writing that the individual was taught. Just how a person writes his or her name depends upon numerous factors, such as muscular control, coordination, health, age, the frequency at which he or she is called upon to write, writing instrument, etc. Over time, all of these factors are blended into an individual's signature; a writer is almost never aware of any of these factors. Instead, through repetition, the writer executes an automatic formation of strokes, which usually but not always tends to assume a consistent pattern. Each signature varies to some degree from a master pattern and from other specimens of his or her signature. For the vast majority of individuals, signing one's name is a habitual act. The act of reproducing this piece of writing called a signature requires a minimum of concentration. Individuals can usually multi-task when signing their signature. The degree of variation among genuine signatures for each individual can range from slight to extreme. This is referred to as a range of variation and is an expected feature.",

      "title": "DIRECTED ACTION AND ANIMAL COMMUNICATION",
      "abstract": "Abstract Human action theory, with its emphasis on intentions and reasons, does little to enhance our understanding of the actions of nonhuman animals. Many animal (and human) actions are directed to objects in the world, including other animals. The notion of directedness can be analysed without attributing intentions or reasons to the agent. An action is directed to object X if and only if: (1) the agent singles out X, either by orientation or by selective performance of the action in the presence of X; (2) the agent recognizes X as a suitable object; and (3) the goal of the action is that X should be in a certain relation to the agent or to some other object. The goal of an action is not necessarily attributable to the agent as the agent's goal in acting. Moreover, an agent can have a goal in acting without understanding how the action achieves the goal. The usefulness of the concept of directed action in the study of animal communication is illustrated with examples from the recent ethological literature.",

Modern man, used to psychological and other methods, may find it offensive: might we call it a challenge to human reason? Where shall we draw the line between the marvellous and the absurd? Certainly we prefer stories that we can measure against our own limited standard. But, God is not logic. He is not (so St Teresa says) even reasonable. And the saint, every saint, always remains unfathomed—a sort of walking scandal, a challenge hurled at reason, a wager. The Creator's imagination infinitely surpasses the cleverest of those who ape him, romancers and poets, and the improbable is the natural habitat of his masterpieces, the Saints. That is why they bewilder us and lay hold of us: does it not prove, in a tangible way, that man is made to surpass himself and that true sanctity scorns to be stereotyped?",

      "abstract": "Man cannot adapt himself to the complicated environment only with the physical equilibrium created through the physiological or biological processes of growth. However, it is possible for him to adapt himself well to the environment, when the psychological equilibrium be formed on the basis of biological equilibrium. Man acts in various ways in order to maintain such equilibrium. Personality develops itself into a new form through adjustment to the environment, and also through creating a new environment. Human needs should be met adequately to achieve the desirable adaptation to the environment through the continuos processes of control and creation for adjustment. When human needs not be met or met to excess, an emotional instability would result, that is the cause of maladjustment. Psychological mechanism is used to overcome emotional needs and tensions, while anatomical mechanism isused to protect the organization of human body from maladjustment. Especially psychological mechanism appears differently according to the individual; as it were, it appears as the from of mechanisms, of escape, defense, and aggressiveness. Among these there are those accepted socially and those rejected socially. The Mechanisms accepted socially lead to the low level of personality development. Therefore, guidance programs should be made so that pupils may not take the unacceptable mehcanisms.\r\n The following methods are recommended to guide pupils in terms of adjustment mechanism:\r\n 1. To eliminate factors for frustration through controlling conditions of envioronments.\r\n 2. To give the opportunities to evaluate himself, so that he may know whether or not behaviors to meet his needs be acceptable sociallly.\r\n 3. To train perseverance in case the pupil be frustrated psychologically.\r\n 4. To foster ability to determine the adequate standard of psychological needs.",

On one, it depends entirely on whether there exists a collective agreement; and if no such agreement exists, no one is obligated to reduce her/his consumption or pollution unilaterally. On the other, the lack of a collective agreement is morally irrelevant, and regardless of what others are doing, each person is obligated to limit her/his pollution and consumption to a level that would be sustainable if everyone were to act in this way. I argue that the truth is somewhere between these, but that a very precise specification of the extent of one's responsibility is impossible. Roughly, what can be said is that each individual ought constantly to strive to do more than she/he does currently and to push her/himself into new, uncomfortable territory, though no one is obligated to martyr her/himself for an environmental cause.",

However, the principal emphasis of priestly ritual is on the invariant and collective, future-directed “aspiration” of Henri Bergson's second source: the “forward thrust” and “demand for movement” that subject the precarious entities of self and society in an uncertain world to inherently unpredictable transformation. Divination and spirit possession likewise serve to open the closure of ritual toward exploration of the encompassing unknown, the wildness that can never wholly be tamed.",

      "title": "Five-Factor Model of Personality",
      "abstract": "The five-factor model of personality (FFM) is a set of five broad trait dimensions or domains, often referred to as the “Big Five”: Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Neuroticism (sometimes named by its polar opposite, Emotional Stability), and Openness to Experience (sometimes named Intellect). Highly extraverted individuals are assertive and sociable, rather than quiet and reserved. Agreeable individuals are cooperative and polite, rather than antagonistic and rude. Conscientious individuals are task focused and orderly, rather than distractible and disorganized. Neurotic individuals are prone to experiencing negative emotions, such as anxiety, depression, and irritation, rather than being emotionally resilient. Finally, highly open individuals have a broad rather than narrow range of interests, are sensitive rather than indifferent to art and beauty, and prefer novelty to routine. The Big Five/FFM was developed to represent as much of the variability in individuals’ personalities as possible, using only a small set of trait dimensions. Many personality psychologists agree that its five domains capture the most important, basic individual differences in personality traits and that many alternative trait models can be conceptualized in terms of the Big Five/FFM structure. The goal of this article is to reference, organize, and comment on a variety of classic and contemporary papers related to the Big Five/FFM. This article begins with papers that introduce the Big Five/FFM structure, approach it from different theoretical perspectives, and consider possible objections to it (General Overviews, Theoretical Perspectives, and Critiques). Next, it discusses papers providing evidence for the Big Five/FFM as a model of basic trait structure (Big Five/FFM Structure). Third, the article considers hierarchical trait models that propose even broader personality dimensions “above” the Big Five, or more-specific traits “beneath” the Big Five (Big Five/FFM in Hierarchical Context). Fourth, it references a series of handbook chapters that each considers an individual Big Five domain in depth (Individual Domains). Fifth, it references several widely used Big Five/FFM measures as well as papers examining the accuracy of Big Five self-reports and observer-reports (Measurement). Sixth, the article discusses the biological and social origins of the Big Five (Biological and Social Bases). Seventh, the article considers stability and change in the Big Five across the life span as well as the developmental mechanisms underlying stability and change (Development). Finally, this article cites evidence that the Big Five influences a variety of important behaviors and life outcomes, from political attitudes to psychopathology (Predicting Behaviors and Life Outcomes).",

Philosophical perspectives on the character of humankind, such as those espoused by Hobbes (1651/1968) or Rousseau (1763/1974), as well as theories of personality and personality development, frequently begin with an assumption about an infant's affective character and abilities for self-regulation. From this foundation they then build a theory of character and its development, integrating issues of regulation and emotional expression. Rousseau was more optimistic in his view of infants as “pure” or basically moral and only subsequently corrupted by society, whereas most philosophers and theorists have held darker views of the clay from which personhood is molded. Thus, it has been more common to view infants as full of seething, vicious drives that are insensitive to others and potentially destructive (Freud, 1905/1953; 1935/1960; 1940/1964; Hobbes, 1651/1968), or at the very least untrammeled and in need of regulation, first from others but subsequently from the self.",

      "abstract": "To reiterate: neither methodologically nor ontologically does an anthropology of ethics have its ground in the individual. The population of its interpretive universe is instead one of subjects in or passing through positions in environments. It is thus a population not of atomic units but of complex relata. Its subjects are for their part already highly complex. They may be individual human beings (though never human beings in their pure individuality). They may be the individualized subjects of the formally egalitarian society; Homines hierarchici, the holistic dividuals of the caste-structured social system (Daniel 1984; Dumont 1980, 1986); the relationalist subjects that Robbins and many others have encountered in Melanesia (Robbins 2004: 13). They may be human collectives, or even human and non-human collectives or assemblages of one or another kind. Nothing in principle precludes the possibility of a cyborgic ethics, an ethics of quasi-objects (Latour 1993), an ethics of corporations of an economic or of some other sort. The only proviso is that the subject occupying or passing through its position in an environment be at or beyond the threshold of the complexity requisite of any system capable of autopoiesis, though such a requirement is never the sufficient condition of an ethical subject position, even a potentially ethical one. Individual human beings typically display such complexity, yet do so only after a considerable course of socialization has taken place, only after a considerable dose of the intersubjective has already been incorporated, already become part of the self (and hence are never individuals in their pure individuality).",

      "abstract": "There is no 'inevitability' about scientific progress. The very variable rates at which science progressed during the Enlightenment — and at other times — should be enough to convince us of this. Some have argued that few scientific theories are entirely value-free and that the practice of science depends greatly upon the cultural context in which it flourishes or wilts. At the very least social changes will affect the rate of scientific advance (leaving aside the question of its direction). The purpose of this chapter is to explore some of the ways in which Enlightenment science was affected by its social framework. In the broadest sense of the term we are talking about the institutionalisation of science. Except for the hypothetical scientist working alone on his desert island, screened from all influences from the outside world, everyone who practises science does so in some kind of institutional framework, even though the institutions may not be primarily designed for science itself (as, for example, when the scientist works for a firm or pursues a strong amateur interest within a loosely structured local community). But the institutionalisation of science as conventionally understood refers to the formally constituted bodies which are dedicated primarily or exclusively to the practice of science.",

A mediating question would be whether this mechanism is set in motion spontaneously, or if it must be seen as almost always assembled and constructed. What are the conditions in which it appears? Can it be elicited anywhere, at any moment? Can it be set in motion by anyone? In order to fulfill its purpose as an artistic practice, and thus to have a far-reaching impact, it needs to be conceptually unobtrusive and inconspicuous. Conversely, with its improper use, any content aiming to convince, to leave an impression or an imprint of authenticity, can be viciously exposed to ridicule or scorn. Worse, it can lose its credibility altogether. Briefly, my thesis is that the use or misuse of the mechanism of catharsis (I would dare to contend – even of affect itself as the power of performing) is directly tied to the functionality or disfunctionality of a community, which in our case means a community with democratic aspirations.",

The concept of receiving additional points for allocation priority if recipient /family register as donors is founded on ‘vested interests’. Living donation satisfies ‘psychological egoism’. Altruism is an ethical doctrine that holds that the moral value of an individual's actions depend solely on the impact on other individuals, regardless of the consequences on the individual itself. Psychological egoists respond that helping others in such ways is ultimately motivated by some form of self-interest, such as intrinsic satisfaction, the expectation of reciprocation, the desire to gain respect or reputation, or by the expectation of a reward in a putative afterlife. Therefore it would probably not be completely unethical to directly use egoism to promote organ donation rather than altruism.",

      "title": "The Sociological Jump before Hominization",
      "abstract": "This paper re-evaluates food-sharing in Pan societies from a sociological perspective, with the purpose of creating a better model of food-sharing in human ancestors.A chimpanzee begging food from another will never attack the other nor snatch the food away, even if begging is ignored. Thus, when a food possessor allows beggars to take food, it is not forced but rather voluntary behavior worthy to the term food-sharing. A food-possessor tends to share smaller portion of food, indicating consciousness of sharing and conflict in abandoning desire.Food-sharing suggests the following implications for social evolution. 1) The beginning of intervention by others into the self-maintaining activities of an independent individual. 2) The first form of interaction through the medium of material objects. 3) The voluntary abandonment of desire, made possible through self-consciousness and the capacity to view oneself objectively. 4) The capacity to sence another's desire as one would one's own, a psychological capacity that is the basis of intersubjectivity. 5) A rudimentary form of economics, in which food takes on value and is possessed, although it soon disappears.In this way, advent of food-sharing in the common ancestor of Pan and Homo was linked to great changes in social structure, relations and recognition. It was a jump comparable to advent of reciprocity and systematic food-sharing.",

It is only through feminist theory that I have realized what it means to have a non-smug theory that is not all about self-satisfaction, self-promotion, and self-preservation as is the case with most Western theoretical projects; it is only through feminist politics that I have discov-ered what it means to have politics that is not translated into the preservation of the status quo and/or reduced to an instrument of power. Generations of feminists are showing us how being politi-cal always calls for one’s own undoing; it involves re-imagining and re-inventing our own positions, locations, and belongings. And finally, it is a life of experiencing the invisibility of women’s thinking and doing that teaches us — if we want to make a dif-ference, if we are looking for a change — not to rely on what is visible, thinkable, sayable, audible, or generally, on what is given or taken for granted.",

It is unclear whether this reflects chimpanzees' general inability or whether they have found other means to coordinate cooperative activities. In the present study chimpanzees could help a partner play her role in a mutually beneficial food-retrieval task either by transferring a needed tool (transfer condition) or by visually or acoustically communicating the hiding-location of the needed tool (communication condition). Overall, chimpanzees readily helped their partner by delivering the needed tool, but none of them communicated the hiding location of the tool to their partner reliably across trials. These results demonstrate that although chimpanzees can coordinate their cooperative activities by instrumentally helping their partner in her role, they do not readily use communication with their partner for this same end.",

In inhabiting diverse environments, the human species has been forced to confront such limitations (of form and function), and develop resourcefulness to survive in the niche(s) we occupy. And, as in other species, our survival is dependent, at least in part, upon the ability to maximally adapt to, and/or compensate for, both biological and environmental constraint(s). Yet, as evidenced by history, human beings are achievers. This is shown by the artifacts of our existence: social structures, tools, and implements that represent a striving to overcome our (self-apparent and/or self-declared) frailties and shortcomings. In short, humans show a trend toward not merely surviving, but flourishing (Gow 2002).",

Such a framework makes intelligible our response to God as holy and fits well within our ordinary practical thought about ways in which some actions, things, and relationships can be beneath one. It can also be situated in any theory of reasons for action that has a place for expressive reasons, and is extremely useful in offering an interpretation of divine action in Scripture. The appeal to the holiness framework as the only necessary framework for divine action does not entail that God does not act on reasons of love for creatures; rather, it entails only that God acts on such reasons contingently, if at all.",

Even before conscious conceptualization occurs, even in\nthe selection of phenomena for study, concepts creep in. The more careful the thinking, the\nmore precise the identiﬁcation of the phenomena for study, the greater the isolation of one\nphenomenon from its neighbours, even its near neighbours. When the careful thinker says,\n‘I mean to include this and to exclude that’ the precision that makes any careful thinking\npossible may come at a price. Less careful but perhaps more nimble thinkers – namely, those\nactors whose behaviour forms the subject of social-science thinking – have a way of putting\nback together what careful thinkers pull apart.\nSecessions and irredentas are near neighbours that can be pulled apart for analysis, properlyin my view, but with points of contact and even, at times, a degree of interchangeability that\nmight permit groups to choose one or the other and that also makes it necessary to treat\nthe two phenomena together, in order to have a full view of each, By and large, the two\nhave not been treated together. They have either been treated in isolation or mentioned in\nthe same breath without an appreciation of their connections. When, however, secessions\nand irredentas are considered together, some rather startling conclusions emerge. Since the\ntwo phenomena are sometimes alternatives to each other, the frequency of each is, in part, a\nfunction of the frequency of the other. Furthermore, the strength of a given movement may\nbe, in part, a function of the possibility that the alternative movement may arise. Indeed, the\nfate of a movement, at least in the sense that it manages to extract concessions from a central\ngovernment, may depend on which course it takes.",

But the name and address are symbols of one's identity. In every-day life one identifies people by these criteria and they identify themselves in this way. A person's knowledge, insight and faculties are much less important in this respect. We speak about amnesia in this paper only when the consciousness is not deeply clouded, orientation is retained, and the possibility of forming impressions is not completely lost. However, when knowledge and general information have been impaired, in addition to the loss of identity and address, the case is still classified as amnesia. Although this state is well known,",

      "abstract": "Existing predominant approaches within virtue ethics (VE) assume humans as the typical agent and virtues as dispositions that pertain primarily to human–human interpersonal relationships. Similarly, the main accounts in the more specific area of environmental virtue ethics (EVE) tend to support weak anthropocentric positions, in which virtues are understood as excellent dispositions of human agents. In addition, however, several EVE authors have also considered virtues that benefit non-human beings and entities (e.g., environmental or ecological virtues). The latter correspond to excellent character dispositions that would extend moral consideration and care for the benefit of non-human beings, entities, or entire ecosystems. In this direction, a few authors have argued that EVE could be considered non-anthropocentric insofar as it could: (a) promote non-human ends, well-being, and the flourishing of non-human beings and entities; (b) involve significant relations to non-humans. Drawing from different traditions, including ecofeminism and care ethics, we argue for a broader notion of self and a decentered notion of virtues. The broader notion of selfhood corresponds to the “ecological self”, one that can be enacted by both human and non-human beings, is embedded in a network of relations, and recognizes the more-than-human world as fundamental and yet indispensable otherness. We suggest that this broader notion of agency allows for an expansive understanding of virtues that includes a-moral functional ecological virtues, which can be exercised not only by humans but also by certain non-human beings. This alternative understanding of selfhood and ecological virtues within EVE could have several theoretical and practical implications, some of which may enable different types of agencies and transform collective action.",

The combination of the qualities 3, 4, and 5 are, as it were, man's accessories in his struggle for existence, and can be used to serve his aggressive needs. - Every cultural development leads in the course of generations to an increase of intellectual awareness, because an increasing share of indispensable knowledge must be passed on verbally. At the same time the importance of direct, practical first-hand experience and imitative learning declines. Especially for those men whose occupations primarily involve theoretical activities a discordance arises between the world of their imaginations and consciously-controlled ways of thought and behaviour on the one hand, and their endothymic impulses, moods and feelings (which mostly originate from the innate predisposition for gregarious life) on the other. If rationalistic processes predominate in shaping forms of social interaction, man will have to manipulate the behaviour of his fellow-men as well as his own mental capacities for emotional distancing, disregarding or even violating the incalculable \"endothymic\" part of his being.

By truly human, I mean where each and every individual is treated in her fullest human dimensions (psycho, socio, bio, spiritual and other dimensions)?treated as if each person were a poet. The pink period in me sees traditional theory, in terms of the aim of fostering the fully human, not only as basically irrelevant but also as distracting or harmful. This stage declares my independence. Forget traditional theory?and forget the attitudes and practice that engender it! At least, that's how it seems to me now. The poetic imagination is too much of a stranger in traditional theory, even in the context of discovery it seems to me?similar to the way I imagine that such poetry as is involved in theoretical chemistry or physics is alien to alchemy. The poetic imagination, as I understand it (2003), is part of what Aristotle called contemplation. It includes what that involves, e.g. being thoroughly open to surprises in seeking what is truly human. At a minimum, the poetic imagination has the utility of not being chained to optimism about the prospects for?and to what seems useful for?making gold out of the baser metals of public administration experience.

The behaviors involved may include prayer, ritual, sacrifice, or nothing extra-ordinary, and may be individual or group, take variable lengths of time, may or may not require evidence of the validity of having communicated, and may yield what is seen as explicit confirmation of the reason for communicating, or no \"results\" at all. Psychologically, believing involves making meaning out of ambiguity, imagining, and other cognitive constructions. It draws no conclusions about whether what is believed is false or true. Believing is the connecting link that holds other fundamental psychological processes such as perception, value attribution, and learning, as well as interpersonal processes such as communicating, together. It is mostly below conscious awareness from the micro to macro levels; a small proportion of it becomes conscious. This chapter puts communicating with unseen entities squarely under the neurophysiological microscope, while also accounting for cultural mechanisms and having applied implications.",

The structural factors which have been suggested as pivotal in determining the nature of the artist archetype have included: (1) the atypicality of the carver/artist/s labour process via-à-vis that of other workers; (2) the development of an alternate value profile congruent with that atypical process; (3) the need for itinerancy/migration to ensure a large enough market for self-support; (4) dependence on the élite class for patronage; (5) relative economic insecurity; and (6) a definition of the product which necessitates solitary labour. These factors combine to create in the general public the image of the artist described earlier. Some carvers and artists may appear to exhibit the traits imputed to them, and even ‘play into’ their expected image; but this phenomenon can be explained without invoking some innate ‘artistic temperament’ or transcultural ‘artist's rôle’. Rather, we can conclude that carvers and artists, like other human beings, are subject to specific material and social constraints that shape their own consciousness and that of their public. Though individuals make art, it is as true of art as of history, that ‘they do not make it under circumstances chosen by themselves, but under circumstances directly encountered, given, and transmitted from the past’.",

      "abstract": "An integrative ecological conception of the activities in the world focuses upon areas of interaction. This emphasizes the complexity of interrelationships, much of which is beyond our current comprehension. Our ignorance demands our respect. It is of heuristic value to regard any activity as a subsystem and determine the areas of interaction of that activity, to note its suprasystemic concerns and its costs. Does the measure of performance of the activity relate to and augment what is of greater ultimate value to us: human happiness and fulfillment? We need to note the true costs of activities. But these are not always known, and may be unknowable. We have few ways to envision the future potential uses of resources, whether human or otherwise. The future costs to ourselves and our children may very well be large unless we adopt a ‘caretaker’ approach to our resources. Our resources are precious and limited, sometimes irreplaceable and finite. They are gifts to be cherished and cared for, to ensure their lasting benefit for our existence. All activities have functional limits; should these be exceeded, catastrophic disruptions occur. It is best for the humans and all other subsystems to live within their means in order to achieve greater stability and further viability. This remains a great task for us today.",

Certainly it is not a film in the ordinary way which follows a plan, still less a script, not at all a story or a narrative and it is hardly an essay, and it destroys most systems of reference in the usual sense. What then determines not simply the images and sounds that appear but their relations to each other? Much of these seem illogical, undirected, and though it is possible sometimes to perceive an association for the most part these are extremely distant and obscure even if these remote elements 'suddenly' fuse and coalesce. The film is not a representation but a manifestation, a demonstration (but of what?), a collection of documents whose order can be stated but whose significance is hard to discern. Above all, the film seems to be a record of the direct experience of making the film itself, an immediacy which results in an abundance of metaphors and signs but outside of the logical or the significant, even beyond control as if the film, in the instantaneities of its associations and linkages, has written itself.",

The human being is a singular being. Indeed, the coexistence of two dimensions of different nature, material and spiritual, is the most important difference between the man and the rest of living beings. Moreover, in man appears a new characteristic, unique between the living beings, the ethical component. The values and guidelines of the moral and ethical behavior of the human being must be considered of natural origin since they have contributed to the success and survival of the species. The man is not only Homo sapiens but also Homo moralis. The recognition of fault, self-control, solidarity, love, generosity, altruism and honesty, among others, are innate qualities in the human beings. The unit of the human species demands the respect and the consideration of the same dignity for all its members, but only for its members. The philosophical anthropology emphasizes the singularity of each human being, each person. This agrees totally with the data of the science, which emphasize the individual and singular genetic identity of each human being.",

      "abstract": "Over the millennia, people have developed normative standards, legal frameworks, personal capabilities and moral theories for assigning responsibility to a complex interacting web of humans, as well as the groups they form.Where responsibilities lie is not always straightforward, partially because responsibility may include different concepts.Nicole Vincent (2011) distinguishes six responsibility concepts in her taxonomy.First, virtue responsibility, where calling someone responsible is to say something that is good about their character, as exemplified in their reputation for doing what is seen to be the right thing.Second, role responsibility, which can be seen as someone's obligation, given the social or institutional role they have taken on, or that has been assigned to them.Third, outcome responsibility, where being responsible would imply that someone is blameworthy for their actions and/or the outcomes of their actions.Fourth, causal responsibility, whereby to be responsible is to cause or to create the conditions for various outcomes.Fifth, capacity responsibility refers to an individual's mental cognitive and volitional capacities, which determine their moral agency and the extent to which they can be held responsible for their actions.Finally, liability responsibility refers to the act of holding someone responsible for what happened.Holding someone responsible 'refers to the things that someone must do, or how they should be treated, to set things right' (Vincent, 2011, p.18).Increasingly rapid developments in machine learning (ML) have focused the public's interest in the current and future impact of artificial intelligence (AI).Technological advances have led to the emergence of new autonomous AI agents, which, once developed and deployed, will behave in ways that cannot be predicted by their developers and users (Russell, 2019).Unlike previous expert systems, modern statistical AI is based on representational learning methods (LeCun et al., 2015).These methods allow developers to 'feed' algorithms unstructured data, which enables deeplearning algorithms to learn, resulting in the emergence of behaviours which often exceed human ability.Representational learning is implemented via a black box -one can view its input (data) and output (behaviour), but not its internal workings (Castelvecchi, 2016).Therefore, AI agents can behave in ways which are autonomous and unpredictable.AI introduces a novel societal issue -the responsibility gap -where the designer and user of AI are not fully capable of predicting the AI's behaviour (Matthias, 2004).Although AI may have causal efficacy, it is not clear who should be held responsible.In the Cambridge Handbook of Responsible Artificial Intelligence, Silja Voeneky, Philipp Kellmeyer, Oliver Mueller, and Wolfram Burgard have edited a volume which addresses the most urgent societal, philosophical, ethical and legal challenges brought about by problems surrounding AI responsibility.It comprises contributions from different disciplines and sectors, which is necessary given the breadth and scale of the task at hand.The book is in eight parts.It starts with the fundamentals of responsible AI and then explores the present and future strategies for AI governance in the US and Europe.In parts III and IV, the book delves into liability frameworks and addresses the central issues of fairness and non-discrimination in AI systems.Part V explores responsible data governance methods more closely.Parts VI and VII discuss appropriate governance approaches for specific AI system sectors, such as financial services and the healthcare industry, which includes neurotechnology.The final section confronts particularly complex and such contentious topics as AI use in security applications and armed conflicts.",

The secular is what outgrows religion; it looms on the incompressible horizon of memory as what's left when religion is loosened from the fossilizing effects of memory and fades into hope. Neither polytheism nor atheism, much less secularism, has ever achieved such an iconoclastic conception of God. The ideology of salvation and its changing-worlds motif still holds, though not, perhaps, in as dualistic a mood as with Tertullian. It continues to control the texture of the good life and its ramifications into the various goals of human existence, whether ultimate or penultimate, individual or social, spiritual or temporal.",

If such laws did not govern the whole extent of the real, possible or conceivable world, or if, although autonomous, they could not be inferred from one another by some system of relations or transfers, I fear that human reflection, in spite of its partial successes, might seem condemned to reveal itself vain, since gaps, or fundamental absences of relationship, could put its cogency into question in a decisive fashion.",

The elusive priority of the self in relation to its action, as well as the priority of persons in relation to one another, is also important and characteristic of religious apprehension of God in some of its modes anyway. On the other hand, the two more personal models, Schleiermacher's and Barth's, include a feature that is conspicuously lacking in the causal model, yet equally important to religious experience, the aspect of immediacy. So there may be good reason for preferring one model to another, while not excluding one or another. It is, after all, with a model that we have to do, and not with the thing itself. The relation of God and the world is unique and mysterious. It is not surprising that several different models have been used to interpret it.”",

      "title": "Tutorial 1-3: Leader Election and Pattern Formation in Swarms of Deterministic Robots",
      "abstract": "In a given environment, the ability for the swarm of robots to succeed in the accomplishment of the assigned task greatly depends on global properties assigned to the swarm, and individual capabilities each robot has. Examples of such global properties are the ability to distinguish among themselves at least one (or, more) robots (leader), to agree on a common global direction (sense of direction), or to agree on a common handedness (chirality). The individual capacities of each robot are its moving capabilities and its sensory organs. To deal with cost, flexibility, resilience to dysfunction, and autonomy, many problems arise for handling the distributed coordination of swarms of robots in a deterministic manner. This issue is motivated by the minimal level of ability that the robots are required to have in the accomplishment of basic cooperative tasks. In other words, the feasibility of some given tasks is addressed assuming swarm of autonomous robots either devoid or not of capabilities like (observable) identifiers, direct means of communication, means of storing previous observations, sense of direction, chirality, etc. Leader election and arbitrary pattern formation are fundamental tasks for a set of autonomous mobile robots. The former consists in moving the system from an initial configuration were all entities are in the same state into a final configuration were all entities are in the same state, except one, the leader. The latter consists in the design of protocols allowing autonomous mobile robots to form any (arbitrary) geometric pattern. The solvability of both these tasks turns out to be necessary in order to achieve more complex tasks. During this tutorial, we address both problems. We first consider the deterministic solvability of the pattern formation problem assuming swarms of anonymous robots. Next, under the same assumptions, we provide a complete characterization (necessary and sufficient conditions) on the robots positions to deterministically elect a leader. Finally, we show that Leader Election and Pattern Formation are two equivalent problems in the precise sense that, the former is solvable if and only if the latter problem is solvable.",

Keinginan akan kebutuhan tersebut merupakan kebutuhan kodrati yaitu berupa keinginan untuk mencintai dan dicintai Tuhan.

Within psychology, on the other hand, surrender’s position has been likened to an “unwanted bastard child,” and its research has been neglected. Moreover, when occurring in the context of a relationship with another person, the terms “submission” and “obedience,” laden with negative connotations, have been commonly used. We propose that psychologically and spiritually developmental surrender is a common experience both when it occurs in relationship to “reality,” the Self or God, and in the context of relationship with another person, as in love, sex, patientship, followership, and discipleship. We focus on surrender to a spiritual master, which is in some respects the most extreme form of surrender to another person and the most challenging for the modern secular worldview to accept and suggest that, with all its complexity and potential pitfalls, it can be a powerful enabler and facilitator of the search for the sacred, self-transcendence, and spiritual integration.",

According to this definition, a sin is committed when someone does something wrong: human beings are the subject and sin the object. Without a perpetrator, sin would have no existence. Yet the apostle Paul portrays sin differently. In his letter to the Romans, sin comes to life. Humanity is no longer the subject, but the object. It is no longer the person who commits the sin: rather, sin is at work within the person. In conjunction with death, sin rules over the entire world (Rom. 5:12–21). The law is powerless before it. It exploits the commandments of God for its own ends, using them to provoke the very things they were intended to prevent (7:7–13). Human nature, sold out to sin, is powerless to resist. Those who end up doing the evilthat they deplore recognise, to their dismay, that sin has taken charge of their behaviour (7:13–25). In Romans 5–8, sin is the active agent and humanity its passive victim.",

While some philosophers such as Mark Rowlands consider that some animals may be moral subjects (but not full moral agents), others (after Descartes) have argued that only humans possess the requisite cognitive capacities. Three common objections discussed in the essay are that animals (a) cannot reason; (b) do not have language; and (c) are not persons. However, in the light of philosophers/writers such as DeWaal, Bekoff, DeGrazia and Sapontzis, it is arguable that these objections are questionable in themselves, and fail to dismiss the case for animals as moral beings. While species membership may be relevant to the question, it is not decisive. Animals do not need to be ‘persons’ or ‘moral agents’ to act for good, within their own communities and their individual limitations. Such hard categories are arbitrary and prejudicial.\r\n\r\nIn making the case for animals as moral beings, evolutionary biology and neurology give a persuasive account of the role that empathy and reciprocal altruism play in maintaining animal communities. Darwin thought of morality as basic social instincts refined by intelligence. There is good evidence (in animal play, for example) that their behaviour is governed by shared social obligations and expectations. This contention is also supported by the similarities between the brains and nervous systems of humans and other animals, particularly the areas relating to social behaviour. We differ from them in degree, not in kind. While humans can engage with moral situations in a more complex, conceptual way, this isn’t necessary to be moral. Caring about, and acting for, the good of others is what matters morally – not the ability to follow abstract principles and rules.",

There are no empty seats and some people are standing; yet the subway car is not packed so tightly as to be uncomfortable for everyone. One of the passengers standing is a woman in her thirties holding two relatively full shopping bags. John is not particularly paying attention to the woman, but he is cognizant of her. Joan, by contrast, is distinctly aware that the woman is uncomfortable … John, let us say, often fails to take in people's discomfort, whereas Joan is characteristically sensitive to such discomfort. It is thus in character for the discomfort to be salient for Joan but not for John. That is to say, a morally significant aspect of situations facing John characteristically fails to be salient for him, and this is a defect of his character – not a very serious moral defect, but a defect nevertheless. John misses something of the moral reality confronting him … John's failure to act stems from his failure to see (with the appropriate salience), not from callousness about other people's discomfort. His deficiency is a situational self-absorption or attentional laziness.",

      "title": "Outsider Architecture: the Literary Constructions of Eve Langley",
      "abstract": "Outsider architecture references a continuum of unofficial constructions, from the tenuous envelope of found materials that a homeless person folds about themselves nightly, to the compellingly precarious sculptural artefact, painstakingly but illegally built, in a front garden or on public land. One way that the homeless deal with their vulnerability to harsh weather, psychological disturbance and lack of privacy is the construction of ad hoc shelters from found objects and recycled rubbish. These shelters represent one form of outsider architecture. Roger Cardinal notes that another form is the idiosyncratic construction of sculptural assemblages, also, typically from recycled materials, to form architectural structures, modified dwellings, landscaped areas, collections, monuments and shrines that seem to pop up in most cities, or anywhere there are people (169). All over the world, homeless people seek to provide at least temporary shelter for themselves, and at the same time, a certain number of people, sometimes the same people, engage in personal projects of construction in which the expression of individuality is as, if not more, important than physical containment or shelter. \r\nThis article will consider the work of one author, Eve Langley, as a form of outsider architecture and will suggest that the physical entity formed by Langley’s novels, as a manifestation of outsider architecture, provided their author with the hope of psychic shelter when she wrote them. Langley wrote at a time in which it was difficult for a woman to succeed as an artist, or to support herself financially. As well, she experienced a dysfunctional marriage and suffered from uncertain health. Despite these difficult conditions, she wrote compulsively, sending manuscripts, one after another to her publishers, long after they had stopped publishing her work. \r\nYet, the large body of unpublished manuscripts in the Mitchell speaks of more than the mental ill health that is frequently associated with Langley. Consideration of the debates active within the literary community of New Zealand at the time Langley was writing, and the nature and content of, in particular, her novelistic oeuvre, suggests that Langley may have been writing at least partly in response to local literary voices. Despite her peripatetic lifestyle and solipsistic tendencies, Langley was part of the community of writers living in New Zealand in the mid-twentieth century. Her writing was supported and criticised by it, and undoubtedly shaped by it. This article will consider the part this community played in Langley’s writing, the dual aspects of vulnerability and strength, feelings of alienation and centrality, exhibited in Langley’s authorial choices. By examining Langley’s body of work through the lens of outsider architecture, Langley’s prolific literary output in the face of a largely negative reception may be seen, not so much as the sign of a loss of control, but as a strategic, if eccentric, construction of an authorial presence.",

This is the theme of chapter 8, which develops the proposition that the processes by which building actors design and construct a place, and the methods they deploy to understand how objects and people interact, are estranged from, and insensitive to, the human context, or fail to consider the relationships between spaces and the functioning of the human body. Construction practices are disembodied insofar as practitioners rarely relate their work to human scale, or the manifold complexities of the body. As a consequence, what we build is implicated in the (re) production of debilitating spaces, or environs that degrade, and undermine, the body’s capacities to work well within the built environment.",

For all arts are tools for either preserving private life or for ruling the state. There is no need for expounding the individual arts here, or for showing the use for which they were invented and transmitted with great care from the elders to posterity. Rather it is necessary to exhort those who enter upon these studies of literature to consider at the beginning what the goal of these arts is, what benefit is to be derived from them, so that those who know may recognise the power and dignity of the arts more clearly, and choose more carefully the one that is most profitable to learn. They never achieve the perfect teaching whose minds do not look out for the certain goal of their studies, and they wander at random and without order or reason from one discipline to the other. ‘An art is the compound of concepts practised for some useful purpose in life’ (Technē esti systēma enkatalēpseōn engegymnasmenōn pros ti telos euchreston tōn eni tōi biōi) [Galen, Medical Definitions xix.350]; it is proved from the definition of art itself that the goal or benefit in all arts has to be envisaged from the beginning.

Immutability could be spelled out in terms of God having a changeless and perfect character, God having fixed purposes both generally and with respect to each individual creature. Because the limit is both self-imposed and constrained by God's goodness, God's knowledge of the future will be sufficient for him to accomplish any and all of his purposes. Thus, according to this version of open theism, there is no question about whether God is in control and able to act sovereignly. God's knowledge of the world would be truly immense. God would have much greater knowledge of the tendencies of those beings he created and has even more immediate ability to intervene if he desires.",

      "abstract": "Unlike most Western aesthetics, which recognize (aesthetic) pleasure, independent of other values (truth and falsity, good and evil), as the primary value of aesthetic experience, the various Japanese aesthetics recognize a range of objectives and effects that is more complex. First, there is a wider range of types of aesthetic pleasure. Those best known and most influential in the West include aware/mononoaware (an awareness of the poignance of things, connected to a Buddhist sense of transience and to passing beauty); yūgen (deep or mysterious and powerful beauty, especially in Noh theater); wabi (powerlessness, loneliness, shabbiness, wretchedness); sabi (the beauty accompanying loneliness, solitude, quiet); and shibui (an ascetic quality or astringency, literally the sensation afforded by a pomegranate, which also imparts a rich but sober color to wood stains, etc.). Second, Japanese aesthetic experiences and activities are employed in the service of a wider range of objectives. These include (aesthetic) pleasure and the revelation of truth; self-cultivation that is not only artistic but also physical, social, emotional, psychological, and spiritual; the construction of personal, group, and national identity; and the formulation of relationships. This article begins with an overview of the uniqueness of Japanese aesthetics. It then examines several of the unique objectives of Japanese aesthetics in further detail.",

Thus pride is the exposure of purely psychological activity but lunatic in nature. Because, a fool becomes proud and always beats his own drum, but seldom a wise person. Excessive pride is called vanity. In fact, where pride ends, vanity begins. Thus vanity is pregnant with an excessive desire to be admitted by others for one’s achievements, appearance, etc.",

      "abstract": "The evolution of groups into adaptive units, similar to single organisms in the coordination of their parts, is one major theme of multilevel selection theory. Another major theme is the evolution of altruistic behaviors that benefit others at the expense of self. These themes are often assumed to be strongly linked, such that altruism is required for group‐level adaptation. Multilevel selection theory reveals a more complex relationship between the themes of altruism and organism. Adaptation at every level of the biological hierarchy requires a corresponding process of natural selection, which includes the fundamental ingredients of phenotypic variation, heritability, and fitness consequences. These ingredients can exist for many kinds of groups and do not require the extreme genetic variation among groups that is usually associated with the evolution of altruism. Thus, it is reasonable to expect higher‐level units to evolve into adaptive units with respect to specific traits, even when their members are not genealogically related and do not behave in ways that are obviously altruistic. As one example, the concept of a group mind, which has been well documented in the social insects, may be applicable to other species.",

The sense of smell is also involved in overall perception – in particular, by aromas developed in the mouth that activate olfactory receptors through the retro-nasal pathway – and in other functions such as sensory-specific satiety. However, one of the most enigmatic properties of the sense of smell is undoubtedly the variation of its sensitivity according to our state of hunger or satiety. Obviously, smell is not the only sensory modality involved in food intake. In a state of satiety, sensitivity to bitterness was better than in a state of hunger.",

Anyone who endures the (nearly) unlimited power of another—be it a husband, an “oriental despot,” or a popular majority—is robbed of the capacity for self-authorship. I argued that this theft can take several forms: the powerless can be coerced outright or intimidated into conformity and obedience, or they can constrain themselves out of fear. Worse still, they can be socialized and manipulated into welcoming the conditions of their subjection. A well-designed democracy is, for Mill, a means of limiting and dividing power and thereby emancipating individuals from these several forms of domination. I also suggested, however, that individuality was something more than an ideal of equality or non-domination. It has other, more positive elements. Conformity, though sometimes a consequence of domination, is, in other cases, simply a matter of habit or comfort. In fact, Mill holds that it is the human intellect’s natural point of repose. To succeed in living deliberately is to succeed, therefore, in overcoming some of the habits of mind that come easiest. In this chapter, I explore Mill’s account of the demands that individuality places on individuals. I focus especially on Mill’s conception of the “active mind,” which he thinks an integral part of individuality.",

Yet the obsession with novelty implies a focus on final products and a retrospective attribution of their forms to unprecedented ideas in the minds of individuals, at the expense of any recognition of the form-generating potentials of the relations and processes in which persons and things are made and grown. In these processes, practitioners are characteristically called upon to copy the works of past masters. However, though they may be guided by a script or score, every practitioner has to improvise his or her own passage through the array of tasks the performance entails. With examples from music, calligraphy and lace-making, I show that the wellsprings of creativity lie not inside people’s heads, but in their attending upon a world in formation. In this kind of creativity, undergone rather than done, imagination is not so much the capacity to come up with new ideas as the aspirational impulse of a life that is not just lived but led. But where it leads is not yet given. In opening to the unknown — in exposure — imagination leads not by mastery but by submission. Thus the creativity of undergoing, of action without agency, is that of life itself.",

      "abstract": "WITHIN the last decade various schedules have been devised for the measurement of personality. Many of these have been short-lived, because they were loosely-organized, indefinite, vague or intangible. The whole subject of personality study is still more or less unsatisfactory from the standpoint of objective analysis, because the rater must rely upon subjective responses by the person rated, rather than upon his own exclusive analysis, or satisfactory objective methods. The Greek philosophers, centuries ago, began the fascinating study of personality. While their attempts to classify people on the basis of types is chiefly important historically, it shows an early interest in the subject of temperament. They grouped personalities under the four heads: (1) Choleric, (2) Melancholic, (3) Sanguine, (4) Phlegmatic. In modern times the phrenologist claimed to be able to read by studying cranial prominences, without reference to the gray matter within the cranium! Each of us is daily concerned with personality study. Consciously or unconsciously, we are always observing temperamental traits, differences in the character and personality of our associates, our friends, members of our family and casual acquaintances or strangers. It helps us to determine how we shall react, ourselves. A useful application of the measurement of personality may be made to the field of speech. The psychology of speech and personality has much to offer the dramatic director, the stage producer, the teacher of expression and English, whether in college, high school, little theatre or speech clinic. An objective basis had been laid by the many studies of the emotions, since Darwin's Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals appeared. Sir Charles Bell was the first physician to publish the results of his observations on the Anatomy of Expression, in his book by that title, a contribution which gave the physiology of expression a scientific start.",

But if God exerts a non–coercive pressure on people through their conscience to turn to him, and turn from evil, then this drawing towards the good, or tugging away from evil, can only be yielded to, or resisted. There is no neutral state. I give examples of language such as being ‘bound’ to obey one’s conscience, which seem to reflect such non–coercive pressure. I conclude by commenting on free will.",

In the ancient paradigm, work runs the risk of being ejected from the anthropological horizon and down-graded to a mere instrument; on the contrary, in the modern paradigm, work becomes so important as to prevent human beings from any self-realization in other domain than work itself and to generate the risk of a self-exploitation of the person. However, is it possible to overcome both extremes? In contemporary age, there is a shift from the work society to the society of (multiple) works, and work itself is connected with many other components of the person. The person, however, is not only work. Therefore, only if it is balanced with action and contemplation, work can be fully assumed by the person and can pursue its highest meaning, without any risk of one-sidedness.",

      "abstract": "Throughout the history people have had a natural tendency to decorate their bodies and their clothing. It is as old as humanity and derives from variety of needs: the need to stand out, to demonstrate social status, gender, religion, etc. This common desire influenced the development of diverse ornament design techniques among which common guidelines could be drawn within processing and usage of similar materials and also the basic division of jewellery ornaments. Initially modest jewellery items were made of objects that man found in its home environment. The discovery of different kinds of metals triggered a massive technical revolution, which leads to many new design options. Jewellery production is one of the oldest forms of decorative art representing an important element within cultural heritage, which in addition to the esthetic aspect always carries a strong symbolic meaning. \r\nWhen designing jewellery there are numbers of morphological requirements related to the laws of the space cross, shape, volume, mass and art variables (e.g. size, weight, texture etc.) of ornaments and their basic function is to follow the human anatomy. With the help of formal art aspects, designers achieve various meanings and sensory properties of ornaments, which must also follow the aspect of functionality (e.g. the lock mechanism) and the personal comfort of the person wearing a certain piece of jewellery. \r\nThe practical part of this thesis presents the entire process of creating authentic silver jewellery. From the perspective of art aspects concerning rings made with lost wax casting technique, I have focused on the size and the surface texture of the ornament. \r\nThe educational section describes the education process - the preparation and conduct of the jewellery design workshops intended for adult amateur artists.",

      "abstract": "Morality is the adherence to ethical ethics that do not harm others in society. Even the food should not be eaten immediately. One should eat only after giving it to others sitting around him. Ethics should be followed in all the diet, speech, and writing. Only the people who practice asceticism have the right to virtue. This section clarifies what morality means, ignoring the idea that morals cannot be practiced by ordinary people who follow worldly life. The best virtue is to live without harming others even if one is unable to do anything. Udaiyar’s novel emphasizes the idea that man needs four kinds of affirmations, namely, virtue, wealth, pleasure, and home. Thiruvalluvar in particular refers to the same thing. The novel Udaiyar speaks of the moral idea of helping others in worldly life. Human beings should be kind to the poor and needy. They should strive to redress their grievances. Those who live in a higher position in society should take into consideration the interests of the people living under them and fulfill their needs. If we live away from ourselves from dirt, expectation, and innocence, our hearts will become a place where God dwells. Once one's body becomes weak and he is of no use to others and the world, he should renounce all attachments to the world except God. This study shows that by doing so, it is easier to attain salvation. In any of the actions we do in our youth, we should engage in good things that do not harm society. By doing so, society progresses and the country progresses. We can attach ourselves to the domains of home life, the creation of material wealth, and the creation of educational wealth. But in those fields, we must plant righteous acts of virtue.",

If early humans had not discovered that their draw ings conveyed meaning to others as well as to themselves, the earliest form of pictorial communication, picture-writing, would never have begun. Therefore, a deeper study of the writing processes may lead to better understanding of reading problems. The interaction between language and drawing is not surprising if one considers that both are part of the symbolic function of the brain which makes possible the representation of an object, event, or conceptual scheme by means of a signifier or sign. Several behavior patterns fall under this representative or figura ti ve ability of the mind, and all are based on the evocation of an object or event which is not present. This absent object may be evoked through imitative play activities, mental images, graphic images, physical gestures, or verbal actions. These functions appear toward the end of a child's second year and in crease in complexity through the sixth year when they are incorpo rated into more concrete operations which combine representation and abstract thinking.

And while rituals typically do not cause physical changes, they may imbue objects with a particular specialness - a simple gold band may become a wedding ring, while an ordinary dessert may become a birthday cake. To treat such objects as if they were ordinary then becomes inappropriate. How does this transformation take place in the minds of observers, and how do we recognize it when we see it? Here, we suggest that two under-examined elements of ritual need deeper consideration within the context of ritual cognition. We propose a fully integrated operational definition in which these two critical ritual elements - causal opacity and goal demotion - are included. In a pre-registered experiment one-hundred and one adults, in a 2 x 2 mixed-within participants design observed actions performed upon profane objects. These actions were either ordinary (causally transparent and goal apparent) or ritualized (causally opaque and goal demoted), and were described as a blessing, a curse, or were not described at all. Contrary to established findings and pre-registered predictions, we found that ritualized actions alone are not enough to influence perceptions of, and attributions towards objects, and that positive goal information (blessings) are more behaviorally persuasive than negative information. However, we found that participants recalled ritualized action in greater detail and with more specificity than ordinary actions. In effect, we demonstrate that causal opacity and goal information interact to allow us to recognize a ritual as a ritual.",

      "title": "Buddhism, Intuition, and Virtue",
      "abstract": "Buddhism, Intuition, and Virtue Robert Feleppa 1. Introduction Buddha's Four Noble Truths seem to embody a practical morality that values beneficial consequences and the minimization of suffering. However, there is a tension between the aim of this practical morality and Buddhism's highest good of nirvāna: although the Noble Truths aim at the reduction of suffering, they also seem to identify the pursuit of happiness and the avoidance of suffering as among the roots of delusion and attachment to self. Moreover, this practical morality seems to depend in large part on conceptual understanding of the causes of suffering and delusion, as expressed, for example, in Buddha's articulations of the Noble Truths and the Perfections. Yet conceptual modes of thought are also linked in deep ways to attachment to self. Gowans (2015) summarizes the key points as follows: A person on the path to enlightenment, but far short of enlightenment, may well succumb to something akin to akrasia: recognizing that something is wrong, but still doing it on account of lust, anger or other hindrances. Moreover, on common Buddhist models of the path to enlightenment, there is no suggestion that philosophical understanding of a sound argument for no-self or emptiness, or for universal compassion, would by itself make a person compassionate. The intellectualism sometimes associated with the Socratic claim, that a purely rational understanding of what is good would [End Page 121] be sufficient for actually being good, has no counterpart in these Buddhist perspectives. (186) These troubles about the relationship of reason and attachment obscure Buddhism's philosophical as well as its ethical import. Indeed, one might argue that Buddha's concern is with liberation and not morality at all—an amoralism often attributed to figures in the Chan and Zen Buddhist traditions—and typically seen as reflecting Daoist influences on the development of Chinese Buddhism. Daoism's emphatic assaults on conceptual/symbolic reasoning raise some serious questions about how a practice aimed at liberating us from self and reason can assist in the living of a reasoned moral life. However, I think that we can address these concerns by drawing on recent research on the psychology and neuroscience of the emotions and particularly what this research tells us about the relationships between emotion and reason.1 First I will develop two preliminary points: (1) that initial tensions between Buddhism's apparent consequentialism and its central focus on nirvana can be addressed; and (2) its apparent antipathy to conceptualized principles of morality can be partly addressed by considering its primary concern with the cultivation of virtue and not the articulation of codes of conduct. However, this only sets the stage for inquiry into the deeper connections between ethical transformation and selflessness, especially as articulated in the thoughts of the influential Third Patriarch of Chan Buddhism, Jiangzhi Sengcan (496?–606 CE), and particularly as expressed in certain passages of a work attributed to him, the Xinxinming (The Verses of the Heart-Mind). Although these can be interpreted as defending an amoralistic, possibly iconoclastic reading of Buddhism, I will support a reading with a quite different thrust. I argue that Sengcan offers a subtle understanding of the place of traditional religious practices such as meditation (zazen), sūtra study, and adherence to codes of proper conduct, essential for the cultivation of insight and moral character, while at the same time being mindful of two dangers: (1) that traditional practices alone may well reinforce afflictive tendencies if they serve only as means of escape from uncertainty and suffering—a defining feature of Chan—and (2) a related failure to appreciate the subtler and spiritually powerful attachments to beliefs, manifest in the ways we hold or favor or identify with beliefs. The two tendencies are interrelated: by suppressing thought and feeling, one prevents the inward reflection needed to reveal deeply seated emotional leanings. Jeff Shore (2016) remarks: If zazen is thoroughgoing, one's mind is not caught or hindered by anything. But if zazen is not yet settled, one may enter the concentrated [End Page 122] oneness of Samadhi—then get stuck there and dwell in it, using it as an escape. It becomes itself a hindrance.

      "title": "Modern Applications of Hibah in the Light of Shari'ah Objectives of Gift and Donation Contracts (Al-Tabarru'at)",
      "abstract": "TABARRU'AT (GIFTS AND CHARITABLE ACTS) The term tabarru' (pl. tabarru'at) is derived from the root b-r-', meaning excel. For instance, He excelled in knowledge, courage, or other qualities; or excelled his companions in knowledge; or was, or became accomplished; perfect or complete, in every excellence, and in goodness. (1) Tabarru' bil-'ata' means, he gave what was not incumbent or obligatory on him; gave supererogatorily; or gave gratuitously, unasked, or unbidden. The jurists, taking into consideration the basic linguistic meanings and the essence projected by wasiyyah, waqf, hibah, 'ariyah, qard and other similar contracts derive the technical meaning of tabarru' as, contract which extends wealth or its benefit to others, immediately or in the future, without desiring a compensation and with the intention of doing a pious deed (bi qasd al-birr wal-ma'ruf). This definition presents tabarru' contract as the genus and places wassiyah, waqf, and the like as its sub-contracts (anwa'). Tabarru'at, inclusive of its sub-contracts, are acts of piety and charity. (2) This is grounded in Q 5: 2: Help ye one another in righteousness and piety, but help ye not one another in sin and rancor: Fear Allah. For Allah is strict in punishment. The Qur'an commentator, al-Jassas al-Razi (d. 369/980) elaborates: The verse enjoins every Muslim to support another in all types of acts which come under piety. (3) Acts of charity that support each other either in kind or cash or in any other form of benefit are part and parcel of piety. Another verse (Q 2:180) states: It is prescribed, when death approaches any of you, if leave any goods, that make a bequest to parents and next of kin, according to reasonable usage; this is due from the God-fearing. Even though the verse is specifically on the topic of bequest (wassiyah), it sheds light on the essence of tabarru'at. The verse encourages the dying person to consider his or her parents and next of kin in the spirit of love. The person is advised to allocate certain amount for parents and next of kin from his or her property without asking for anything in return. The spirit in tabarru'at is to share wealth and benefit others because of love and not because of personal gain. Tabarru'at is about caring for each other. Another verse of the Qur'an emphasizes that righteousness is not about performing salutary regulations only, but it is also about caring for each other. With the salutary regulations, a righteous man should strive for love of Allah and the love for his fellow-men: It is not righteousness that ye turn your faces towards east or west; but it is righteousness to believe in Allah and the Last Day, and the angels, and the Book, and the Messengers; to spend of your substance, out of love for Him, for your kin, for orphans, for the needy, for the wayfarer, for those who ask, and for the ransom of slaves; to be steadfast in prayer, and practice regular charity; to fulfil the contracts which ye have made; and to be firm and patient, in pain (or suffering) and adversity, and throughout all periods of panic. Such are the people of truth, the God-fearing. (4) In this verse, extending assistance to kin, orphans, needy, wayfarer, beggars, and slaves are all considered as acts of piety, providing that the assistance rendered should proceed from love and no other motive. Hadiths also shed light on the importance of tabarru'at. Jurists present tahaddu tahhabbu (exchange gifts so that you may love one another) (5) as the principle source on which the legality of Hibah is based. This hadith touches upon the essence of tabarru'at, which is to give gifts to friends and relatives out of love. The legality of tabarru'at is established through consensus as well; the Muslim ummah agree on it to be a pious act. (6) In order to perform acts of tabarru'at as a contract, a Muslim has to deal with its components (arkan). …",

      "abstract": "Wandering is often one of the first symptoms that gets an individual living in the community into trouble, or puts him or her in danger. Wandering is a single-minded determination to walk that is unresponsive to persuasion. The behavioural definition distinguishes between wandering with risk and wandering as nuisance, as well as interpreting walking as wandering if the behaviour is to excess, even though there is no risk or disturbance to others. Separation anxiety motivates those with dementia to cling to this other person, or if the person with dementia is removed to another setting in order to give their family respite from the suffocating pressure of being trailed, they will attempt to leave so they may seek the whereabouts of those significant others.

      "title": "So Then They Are No More Twain, But One: An Exploration of Liminality",
      "abstract": "Delivered on July 21, 2022 to the Prague EuroSeminar, a forum for young Latter-day Saints in Europe, which was held at Cumorah Academy, located near Prague, Czech Republic.When the curtain rises on the Judeo-Christian garden story, we encounter a series of in-between or liminal phenomena: 1) Adam and Eve, who represent neither fallen humanity nor exalted deities, who “have no status, property, insignia, secular clothing, rank, kinship position, nothing to demarcate them structurally” from each other and who thus, in the words of King Lear, represent “naked unaccommodated man”;2 2) the garden paradise located neither here nor there, neither in a state of temporality nor atemporality, betwixt and between as it were life and death, good and evil, heaven and hell; and 3) two commands—to multiply and replenish the earth and not to partake of the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil lest their eyes should be opened and they should die—insoluble commands on their own terms, a Gordian knot if you will, thus leaving the two first humans suspended in an endless state of limbo.3In this remarkable feat of literary brevity, we discover the very blueprint that defines the human condition: the conundrum of opposites, or “immortal antagonists” (using a term coined by Freud). Like Adam and Eve, we wander as strangers on earth “from a more exalted sphere”4 with eyes that see “through a glass, darkly”5 and perceive the world in terms of explicit separateness or opposites (what in Christian parlance we term “the Fall”), but in our journey we have the potential to reclaim a state of at-one-ment by recovering lost sight, or put another way, by developing in-sight, and thereby see again for the first time the implicit oneness or wholeness of all things.Through his characters, the Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoevsky explored the murky depths of the human psyche to try to pinpoint the source of unconscious drives and behaviors motivating violence, ideology, addiction, and the like. He ruthlessly probed opposing aspects of his characters’ personalities and in doing so gave voice to his own raging internal debates, many of which coalesced around the subject of religion. With one character, Dostoevsky might assume the role of the Christian apologist and persuasively argue for the necessity of faith, while with another character he might discard faith in favor of reason and discount religion as nothing more than mere children's fantasy, and in both instances, “each Dostoevsky would have been expressing himself with the utmost sincerity.”6Supposing, though, that the tension between faith and reason could be resolved, what would the polarities look like? “Well,” you might say, “reason entails sense, rational thinking, logic, and the like,” but you see, every one of those descriptions of reason gets you no closer to understanding its meaning unless paired with its respective opposite. In other words, reason or sense exists as a concept only in relation to non-sense and vice versa, and to insist on an either-or dichotomy ultimately amounts to calling for the end of existence itself. “The sad truth,” writes Swiss psychoanalyst Carl Jung, “is that man's real life consists of a complex of inexorable opposites—day and night, birth and death, happiness and misery, good and evil,”7 and, I might add, war and peace. You see, the Russian novelist and author of War and Peace, Leo Tolstoy, understood that you cannot have war except in relation to peace, thus eliminating the possibility of a war or peace scenario.I want us now to step back for a moment and consider ideas about marginal or liminal persons in our faith tradition. “These are people who are somehow left out in the patterning of [church culture and hierarchy], who are placeless,” writes anthropologist Mary Douglas in her treatise on the concepts of pollution and taboo in various societies and cultures. “They may be doing nothing morally wrong, but their status is indefinable.”8 Often, for them going to church is less about finding comfort and getting prejudices validated and more about comforting others and even being afflicted by them.9 Such individuals can struggle at times to connect emotionally and spiritually with their fellow brothers and sisters in the body of Christ, and yet the very symbol of the body of Christ speaks to the mystery of sacraments, or re-membering otherwise dis-membered opposites—the body and blood of Christ. As such, as Alan Watts writes, “What has been chopped and scattered becomes re-membered. So, in the Christian scheme, ‘Do this in remembrance of me.’ You see, the Christ has been sacrificed, chopped up, but the mass [sacrament] is celebrated in re-membrance. One of the old liturgies says the wheat which has been scattered all over the hills and grows up is gathered again into the bread. Re-membered.”10Indeed, Jesus of Nazareth epitomizes the archetype of the liminal figure by virtue of his resisting classificatory boundaries and stripping off pretensions of social rank and status. Such marginal types represent an open versus closed type of morality and predictably run afoul of established norms just as they likewise infuse much-needed humanity.11 Holy people are whole, which is to say, they have reconciled the opposites, and so, “there's always something slightly scary about holy people. And other people react to them in very strange ways; they can't make up their minds whether they're saints or devils. And so holy people have, throughout history, always created a great deal of trouble, along with their creative results.”12However, the tradition into which Jesus was born identified the “holy” as something or someone “set apart,” hence the myriad Levitical rules designed to separate, purify, demarcate, and punish transgressors. Accordingly, “only by exaggerating the difference between within and without, above and below, male and female, with and against”13 did Jews seek to ensure a semblance of order in the face of otherwise disorder or impurity.In this context, consider the account that the author of the Fourth Gospel, the book of John, records, namely that of Jesus’ encounter with a Samaritan woman at Jacob's well; however, bear in mind that John chooses the location of this encounter for symbolic reasons. In the Hebrew scriptures, one went to a well to find a wife. Take, for example, Abraham, who sends his servant to his place of origin to find a wife for his son Isaac. Abraham's servant travels to the town of Nahor and stops at a well where he meets Rebekah—the future wife of Isaac. Jacob, the son of Isaac and Rebekah, likewise finds his wife Rachel at a well in the town of Haran. Finally, take Moses, the Old Testament precursor to Jesus of the New Testament, who, fleeing pharaoh, travels into the wilderness, where he sits next to a well and encounters seven daughters of a priest from Midian who come to draw water from the well. A skirmish with some rogue shepherds ensues, but Moses rises to the occasion and fends them off, for which the father of the seven daughters gives one of his daughters, Zipporah, to Moses to become his wife. Now to John's account.In writing this account, John doesn't have Jesus ask just any woman for a drink of water. Rather, he specifically mentions that Jesus entreats a Samaritan woman to give him drink, thus underscoring the tension between the Jews and the Samaritans. In response to the woman's surprise at his asking her, a Samaritan, for a drink of water, Jesus immediately invites her to drink of the living water that only he can provide. Listening to Jesus’ words with literal ears only confuses the woman further, who questions how he could give her drink when he doesn't so much as have a bucket with which to draw water. Jesus pushes her further to listen with metaphorical ears when he teaches, “whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up into everlasting life.”14 The literal meaning of Jesus’ words gives way to the metaphorical meaning, as evidenced by the Samaritan woman's earnest supplication: “Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw.”15 Instead of perpetuating boundaries, Jesus offers living water that weds (hence the symbol of the well) opposites and emphasizes their inherent oneness. As such, when viewed through the lens of living water, it suddenly becomes clear that people and things are “joined together by the boundaries we ordinarily take to separate them, and are, indeed, definable as themselves only in terms of other [people and] things that differ from them,” as Alan Watts describes.16Consider also an episode involving a woman, whom we're told “was a sinner,” who unexpectedly entered the home of a Pharisee with whom Jesus was dining, and, according to Luke, “stood at [Jesus'] feet behind him weeping, and began to wash his feet with tears, and did wipe them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment.”17 Jesus straightway forgave the woman her sins, “for she loved much,”18 but rebuked the Pharisee, who falsely supposed that setting himself apart from seeming impurity constituted holiness. In one of his short stories, the Welsh author and mystic Arthur Machen explored this misguided assumption: We are naturally inclined to think that a person who is very disagreeable to us must be a very great sinner! It is very disagreeable to have one's pocket picked, and we pronounce the thief to be a very great sinner. In truth, he is merely an undeveloped man. He cannot be a saint, of course; but he may be, and often is, an infinitely better creature than thousands who have never broken a single commandment. He is a great nuisance to us, I admit, and we very properly lock him up if we catch him; but between his troublesome and unsocial action and evil—Oh, the connection is of the weakest.19Jesus thus reproaches the Pharisee who eschewed becoming “emotionally involved with life and people as was the woman who was a sinner,” writes John A. Sanford. “She found greater love than the Pharisee, and she was made whole, for in spite of her sins she had lived.”20 Indeed, Jesus proclaims, “I am come that they might have life, and that they might have it more abundantly.”21 In this account, we're dealing with two liminal figures, two outcasts as it were—Jesus and the woman we're told was a sinner—both of whom defy the social norm of the day and occupy that unique in-between space that on the one hand threatens the established order and on the other awakens and revitalizes it.Relatedly, if you've read Dostoevsky and ever wondered why prostitutes and otherwise sexually compromised women who belong to this liminal category of despised or outlawed individuals ultimately redeem the hyperrational and aloof protagonists, now you understand why. These were women who self-sacrificed to the point of offering their own bodies to strangers in order to mitigate the suffering of others, who embodied a “compassion springing not from any theoretical doctrine of social pity, with its implied sense of distance and hierarchy, but out of a frame of mind and heart placing the forgiver on exactly the same moral-human level as the forgiven,” as literary scholar Joseph Frank wrote in his study of Dostoevsky.22 Curiously, this archetype of the benevolent prostitute frames Matthew's story of Jesus’ virgin birth, which he prefaces with a seventeen-verse genealogy intended to establish Jesus’ messianic credentials.Matthew quite intentionally weaves four women into this genealogy, all of whom were known to readers of the Hebrew scriptures; however, these women were Gentiles, not Jews. Moreover, they would have been considered sexually compromised by the standards of their day. As such, Matthew's genealogy is proclaiming that “the line that produced Jesus of Nazareth flowed through the incest of Tamar, the prostitution of Rahab, the seduction of Ruth, and the adultery of Bathsheba” and that to be born into an otherwise questionable lineage “makes no difference, because God can bring holiness out of any human symbol of brokenness, inadequacy, or even evil. God can bring holiness out of incest, prostitution, seduction, and adultery. . . . God can work through any set of human circumstances to bring holiness out of life.”23 Accordingly, for Dostoevsky as with the writers of the Gospels, who sought in words to capture the life of Jesus of Nazareth, redemption comes through transcending human categories and opposites, not through promoting detachment and insisting on hard lines and rigid concepts. Thus, drinking deeply the living water of the New Testament rather than the purifying water of the Old Testament unites people and nations spiritually such that nothing can come between them and the love of God.Returning to the subject of faith and doubt, Paul Tillich, a German-American theologian, in his short but profound book titled Dynamics of Faith addresses these opposites within the context of what he calls “ultimate concern”: Ultimate concern is ultimate risk and ultimate courage. . . . If doubt appears, it should not be considered as the negation of faith, but as an element which was always and will always be present in the act of faith. Existential doubt and faith are poles of the same reality, the state of ultimate concern. The insight into this structure of faith and doubt is of tremendous practical importance. Many Christians, as well as members of other religious groups, feel anxiety, guilt and despair about what they call “loss of faith.” But serious doubt is confirmation of faith. It indicates the seriousness of the concern, its unconditional character.24Indeed, meditating on something's opposite can prove highly generative. For example, Shakespeare has Hamlet meditate on death by gazing at the skull of Yorick. Doing so may seem like a rather morbid and gloomy enterprise, but the deeper one penetrates the darkness of death, the more one understands its opposite, the radiance of life, “in the same way that manure is contributive to the perfume of the rose.”25Ironically, then, “To doubt the God you believe in is to serve him. It's an offering. It's your gift.”26 In an interview with Blair Hodges, Mary Rakow, author of the novel This Is Why I Came, observed, I believe that there is this other, this Holy One, and what this Holy One wants is relationship with us. God could have made robots . . . [but] we have freedom. And if we can't say no, then we can't say yes. So, I think saying “no,” if that's what we're feeling, then that's our prayer . . . [and] that doesn't hamper God's love for each of us. It doesn't make God pull back. It doesn't make God wince. I believe what God wants is what we want in all of our love relationships. Even if we have to hear painful things, we want the other person to speak truthfully to us. We want to be really intimate, and God's love is a perfect love. So it can hold everything.27Accordingly, in Isaiah, the Lord declares, “I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and create evil: I the Lord do all these things.”28 Now there's a god who can hold everything, or, put another way, can transcend opposites.In one of my favorite movies, Life of Pi, the protagonist, Pi, whose very name connotes irrationality or the opposite of reason, describes to a writer precisely what Mary Rakow asserts, i.e., God's capacity to hold everything: Pi: Faith is a house with many rooms.Writer: But no room for doubt?Pi: Oh plenty, on every floor. Doubt is useful; it keeps faith a living thing. Afterall, you cannot know the strength of your faith until it's been tested.29Indeed, by merely holding an intention to make space for doubt, more often than not we discover that we have more capacity than we originally thought; we have, as it were, a spare bedroom inside to host both faith and doubt, and a realization of this expanded capacity in turn enables us to host others’ faith and doubt, to make beloved space for deepened interpersonal connections, and to give others the experience of “feeling felt.”30For understandable reasons, humans in general gravitate to a unipolar universe, and members of our faith tradition are no exception. We want to take a side, as evidenced by a cursory examination of our scriptural canon and published hymns, e.g., “Who's on the Lord's Side?”31 or “I would thou wert cold or hot. So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee out of my mouth”32 or “He that is not with me is against me,”33 and so forth, but at the same time we're reminded that “it must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things,”34 from Joseph Smith, “By proving contraries, truth is made manifest,”35 or from the poet William Blake, “Without contraries is no progression.”36 Far less burdensome to adopt a unipolar view of life that allows one to “escape pain, to seek quiet harbors, to find secure absolutes, even at the cost of worshipping idols”37 than to hold the tension of opposites, but such was not the spirit of the early Saints who valued the pursuit of truth through reasoned debate. In fact, during the Kirtland and Nauvoo years, the Prophet Joseph frequently participated in debates, which “afforded an excellent exercise in logical thinking and expression. Joseph valued the practice, that his followers ‘might improve their minds and cultivate their powers of intellect in a proper manner,’” as Terryl Givens writes in People of Paradox.38William Blake recognized the underlying unity of opposites and “used the image of marriage to convey his sense of a redemptive fusion of the various sets of conflicting values as opposed to compromise—or suppression or victory of one or the other poles. In the true marriage, neither individual is destroyed, but their individual loneliness and limitation is transcended in their mutual creative acts and the fruit they bear—which they could not bear alone.”39 In this regard, the late Eugene England, professor of English at Brigham Young University, taught, “Tragedy does not have to do with presence or lack of ultimate guarantees but with present suffering in the face of the paradoxes [the opposites] that reality progressively unfolds to the tragic quester,”40 which is to say that once one pierces the veil of duality and perceives the world in terms of a both-and interdependent relationship, there's no going back to a simple either-or dichotomy. Hence, tragedy lies in the irreversibility of expanded consciousness and the burden associated therewith. Indeed, as Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. pointed out, “A mind that is stretched by a new experience can never go back to its old dimensions.”41Christianity calls us to hang, as it were, suspended between two opposites, simple faith and intellectual rigor, and to discover truth that unites them. Herein, I would assert, lies the underlying liminal meaning of the Christian cross: nailed to the cross as a living historical man being put to death, Christ transcends death as he transcends life. The symbolism is obvious: to his left and right are the opposed thieves; he himself, in the middle, will descend with one and with the other ascend to that height from which he has already come down. Thus, Christ is bound to neither of the opposed terms, neither to the vertical nor the horizontal beam of his cross, though in a temporal-historical sense he is indeed bound, even crucified, as are we all when we see the implicit oneness in all things but choose to stay and live in a world defined by explicit duality.In Mahayana Buddhism, the term “bodhisattva” refers to such a person who has penetrated this world of illusion and tasted the divine but, rather than depart it to enjoy everlasting burnings, chooses to stay and awake in others the same experience: “The Bodhisattva is one who comes back and appears in the everyday world and plays the game of the everyday world by the rules of the everyday world, but he brings with him upaya, he brings with him some way to show that he's been on the journey, that he's come back, and he's going to let you in on the secret, too, if you—if, if, if—play it cool, and also come back to join in the everyday life of everyday people,” as Alan Watts explains.42 As such, the bodhisattva “returning to the world” means that s/he has discovered that you don't have to go anywhere to find nirvana: nirvana is where you are.43 Indeed, the verbal root buddh- from Buddha means “to awake, know.” We find a marvelous analogue in our own faith tradition in the personage of Ammon, who chose to live among his heretofore enemies, the Lamanites, after having awakened to the eternal oneness of life: “And the king inquired of Ammon if it were his desire to dwell in the land among the Lamanites, or among his people. And Ammon said unto him: Yea, I desire to dwell among this people for a time; yea, and perhaps until the day I die.”44In the Church, we're taught that the “glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth.”45 Light serves as a powerful metaphor of the birth of consciousness into the world, as illustrated in the opening lines of the creation story: “Let there be light.”46 In other words, the quest for light and truth represents coming of age and leaving the comforts of hearth and home, or in spiritual terms, leaving the security of others’ testimonies and discovering one's own path in life, yet the danger of searching for light and truth arises when one discovers aspects of one's faith that seem to contradict past instruction and study. Sincere questioning sometimes can meet resistance from peers and leaders who regard a skeptical attitude as a mark of imperfect faith, and it's in these moments of vulnerability when such individuals understandably can opt for safe harbors replete with security and validation.But I would push back by saying that unity is not sameness: one can't have an experience of self without having an experience of other, and yet in our efforts to promote unity, whether it be social, political, religious, or otherwise, we somehow forget that unity implies duality, which is to say relatedness, and thus attend to only one term of a relationship (the figure) and neglect the other (the ground). You could say that it's the difference between seeing “either a chalice or kissing faces; for the logic of thought the two images are mutually exclusive.”47 Seeing a figure in relation to its ground likewise lends new meaning to Paul Tillich's description of God as “the ground of being,” for just as our being is conditioned by the existence of a ground, so, too, God's work and glory is conditioned by our being.48 Hence, the inner meaning of Jesus’ supplication, “That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be one in us.”49 The two depend on one another for their existence and, thus, constitute a unified whole.Likewise, without the serpent, you can't have God and vice versa; the two are one. Is it any wonder, therefore, that in the Old Testament the serpent takes on a dual persona as both poisonous and healing? Consider the example of Moses, who made a snake out of bronze and attached it to a pole. Anyone who was bitten by a snake could look at the bronze snake and be healed.50 Just as Moses’ staff turned into a serpent and then back into a staff, his hand became diseased before it regained its wholeness. A cycle occurs from the top to the bottom of reality and back again. God exists in one eternal round and can hold the tension of opposites together. By letting the serpent act as his agent, God willed evil but accomplished good. One ascends to godhood by transcending the devil; one transcends the devil by accepting his necessity.51 Christian imagery builds on this underlying relationship and reminds us that “as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up.”52This recognition of God and nature as an integrated whole rather than a system of competing opposites plays out in a Chinese fable popularized by the British author and philosopher Alan Watts: Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, “We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.” The farmer said, “Maybe.” The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening, everybody came back and said, “Oh, isn't that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!” The farmer again said, “Maybe.”The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, “Oh dear, that's too bad,” and the farmer responded, “Maybe.” The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again, all the neighbors came around and said, “Isn't that great!” Again, he said, “Maybe.”53In the unassuming liminal figure of the farmer, we find someone who resists his neighbors’ proclivity for reducing life's consequences to one of two poles and instead sees fortune and misfortune as mutually arising opposites that give way to a transcendent third or middle way, as expressed in the farmer's reply, “Maybe.” Such a perspective neither negates opposites nor clings to them but sees the two as an undulating current flowing together “without compulsory means,” as is so with all pure intelligence.54 A person who taps into this flow experiences anew the original totality of the paradisical garden “with its four mysterious rivers flowing in the four directions from a common source at the center”55 and spontaneously acts from that center in a manner consistent with Jesus’ instruction: “Let not thy left hand know what they right hand doeth.”56Nobody wants to admit that there must be an opponent for the game to go on; instead, we tirelessly labor to eliminate the enemy only to discover that we're fighting ourselves. Indeed, as a widely shared aphorism attributed to Jung reminds us, “Wholeness is not achieved by cutting off a portion of one's being, but by integration of the contraries,”57 for without the shadow there can be no substance. Now, there's a danger associated with letting the cat out of the bag, so to say, and opening others’ eyes to this reality, and one of those dangers is that when people realize that Team A only can exist in relation to Team B, then the energy requisite to go on fighting against the other will dry up. People will see through the game and refuse to keep playing. Indeed, instead of loving our “enemies” with the intent of converting them, we realize that they're terribly important to our knowing that we're nice.58 Such a paradigm shift puts us in the embarrassing position of feeling indebted to those whom we previously considered the recipients of our charity and goodwill. So, what I want you to consider is a scenario where you have come to this realization, and then, like Ammon and the Buddha, you stay grounded in your community and impart your new-found wisdom in such a manner that unifies rather than estranges. This requires a certain art, and I would argue that it's precisely for this reason that Jesus likewise lived among the people and taught in parables.I hope that in our search for truth, each of us will have the courage to endure some dark nights of the soul, similar to what Jesus experienced during his forty-day sojourn into the desert, to take on “some pain, including the pain of doubt and indecision.”59 Those who evade such a crucible, “who believe they believe in God, but without passion in the heart, without anguish of mind, without uncertainty, without doubt, and even at times without despair, believe only in the idea of God, and not in God himself.”60 After all, as Fiona Givens writes, If we assume that religion exists to answer our questions, we will be disappointed, for that is not its purpose. Many of the Savior's sermons seemed calculated to disturb rather than to reassure. After one particularly disquieting discourse, many of the Lord's disciples “walked no more with him.” Jesus turned to His apostles and asked: “Will ye also go away?” They responded simply: “To whom shall we go? Thou hast the words of eternal life.” They were as uncomfortable as any of the other disciples, but they understood that Christ was indeed the Messiah. They had committed themselves to Him. There was nothing to do but follow Him in spite of the cost.61For you and me, the cost likely will not entail martyrdom, or an exclamation point at the end of our lives; rather, it will entail quietly learning how to embrace ambiguity of expression over unequivocalness. It will entail mustering the “courage to live in a radically insecure world with continued integrity.”62In Peter we find the embodiment of this tension, and Jesus clearly foresees that before Peter can rise to the stature of the head of the Church, he first must descend to the depths of hell by thrice denying him. In other words, the ascent only exists in relation to the descent. “Thy mind, O man!,” begins Joseph Smith in a letter dictated from the depths of Liberty Jail, “if thou wilt lead a soul unto salvation, must stretch as high as the utmost heavens, and search into and contemplate the darkest abyss, and the broad expanse of eternity—thou must commune with God.”63If any of you feel spiritually incomplete, I urge you to find a place in this patchwork quilt of questers collectively referred to as the body of Christ, which “needs its full complement of members—the devout, the wayward, the uncomfortable, the struggling.”64 For me, a hallmark of God's grace lies in his working with our strengths and weaknesses to build his kingdom. I take Alma at his word when he testified that “all things denote there is a God,”65 which, in the context of",

      "abstract": "It seems probable that the founders of religions, as of new psychotherapeutic systems, are genuinely intent on discovering new (or perennial but freshly experienced) truths and transmitting these to others. Probably, they are indeed in closer touch with God, mystical experience, the Unconscious or whatever, at least temporarily. But inevitably, it seems, a process of corruption sets in, whereby initial raw contact with new and profound discoveries is imperceptibly converted into dogma and institutionalisation. The closest I have personally come to any understanding and holistic experience of profound truths has been through the writings of Krishnamurti in particular, but also those of mystics generally. I have also had a number of experiences across the years, sometimes in therapeutically oriented groups, which belong to the realm of the profoundly authentic and apparently unrepeatable (by any effort or method), in which personal problems lessen, dissolve or take on new perspectives (Cohen and Phipps 1979). I would refer to this realm as 'holistic', except for the reservation that this word has become an empty cliche. The core problematic issue here is that priests, philosophers, counsellors and others invariably attempt to systematise, colonise and bureaucratise that realm and to license themselves as its gate-keepers.",

      "abstract": "1. There are, in the world, a large number of cooperative work settings where multipleactors interact through a collection of artifacts of some kind. An actor may for exampleplace a document in a location where others can see it and read it. The actor may placeit there for his or her own later use, but at the same time others may access it too. Or theactor may place it there deliberately for the benefit of others. Or the audience is notknown yet. Anyway, whatever the reason for putting it there, since others have access tothe document, other actors may retrieve and use it at some point in time, perhaps forpurposes or in contexts that are quite different from those of the originator. It may alsobe the case that another actor may change the content of the document, change itslocation, rename it, delete it, etc. Such settings are ubiquitous in cooperative work.2. The location of the collection may be a particular shelf, rack, room, or building, orthe collection may be distributed over a number of shelves, racks, room, and buildings.The collection may comprise digital artifacts as well as paper and other physicalartifacts. The items of the collection may be documents such as books, reprints ofscientific papers, technical reports, invoices, design specifications, software code,blueprints, etc. Or the collection may contain parts and sub-assemblies, zoological orgeological samples, forensic evidence, etc. Or the collection may be a heterogeneousassembly of such artifacts. However distributed and heterogeneous the collection maybe, in their cooperative activities actors will (to some degree) interact and coordinatetheir activities through this collection, by changing its state.3. Such collections of artifacts have been termed ‘common information spaces’ with arather problematic choice of words. The term ‘common’ may give the impression thatthe artifacts in the collection mean the same to all actors and are used in the samemanner. The problem arises from using the word ‘common’ as an adjective to‘information space’. What is meant is that the items in the ‘information space’ are used‘in common’ (that is, in the same sense as ‘the commons’ in English villages before theIndustrial Revolution). The term ‘space’ may similarly give the impression that thecollection is in a room or some other kind of unitary location but using the term todenote a distributed assembly of items makes some sense. The term ‘information’,however, not only ambiguous and overworked; it is outright misleading, as it gives theimpression that a ‘common information space’ denotes something like a ‘sharedunderstanding’ or a ‘shared culture’. The problem here is that the constitutive role of theartifacts is lost when the term ‘information’ is used as the key term.",

One use of the notion of will is to pick out these rational motivations, or the psychological faculty in which they occur. I want to go further, however, and suggest that the notion of will or voluntas was used, at least in late medieval and early modern scholasticism, and I suspect before, to construct a distinctive conception of what fully voluntary agency or action is: a practical reason-based conception of agency. According to this conception, to perform an intentional action is to respond to a specifically practical or action-guiding reason, thereby exercising reason in a practical or action-constitutive way. Any account of when and how a concept of the will developed needs, inter alia, to be a discussion of when and how this particular conception of agency developed.",

No diseases present such an infinite variety of light and shade belonging to their own nature, or to their intermixture with other maladies, or to the influence of temperament, of individual peculiarities of habit, or of social position; and therefore the diagnosis of no other class of diseases taxes nearly so much the ingenuity and the patience of the physician. The Diagnosis of almost all other diseases depends principally upon weighing the evidence afforded by physical signs and symptoms, upon evidence addressed to the senses; but in mental disease, it is for the most part dependent upon evidence which is cognizable by the intellect alone, and upon data which the senses furnish to us only at second hand. The physician is compelled to bring to this investigation, not only a knowledge of those functions which are subservient to the vegetative and animal life of the individual, but also a clear and analytical conception of those which collectively constitute mind. He must not only be a physician, but a metaphysician; not indeed in the almost opprobrious sense of the term, but in that better sense which designates a lover of truth, seeking to ascertain not the essence of mind or any other unattainable abstraction, but the laws of mind which are as regular as any other natural laws, and the knowledge of which offers to philosophy a wholesome and legitimate object of research.",

      "title": "I teach therefore I dress",
      "abstract": "From a phenomenological perspective, clothes are never merely representational or functional but complex locales for a range of intentions, affiliations, ideals, subversions and practices. The practice of dressing, whether it be considered fashionable or not, is a potentially highly imaginative and creative process whereby what we wear becomes a liberating experience for both ourselves and others. As Entwistle (2000) suggests, dress and identity always operate on a situated body, located in time and space, where social, historical and cultural relations are ascribed to both getting dressed and being dressed. We consider both our persona and our physicality as individuals in relation to clothes in the present and experiences in the future. \r\n\r\nWith this in mind, my presentation seeks to explore the role of dress in the context of higher education and the creative ways academics embody their occupational practices and philosophies through their clothed bodies. It is often suggested that the role of the educator at university is mainly concerned with activities of the mind and their relationship with their body is always secondary, if not completely ignored. As a result, the clothed academic body is made to be invisible, both to itself and others, whether they are colleagues or students. Yet, they are those who believe dress practices are critical to the success of their pedagogical approaches and scholarly credibility. This paper will highlight these examples in an effort to draw attention to the inherently material and relational aspects of creative dressing practices, and to argue that clothes constitute a critical interface between ourselves and others, making them embody multiple meanings, open-ended explanations and complex social, cultural and political lives.",

      "title": "Communication device for the treatment of a patient with an Eating Disorder",
      "abstract": "All human beings have ‘true self’ inside of them. The true self is a brilliant diamond-like mind, filled with love, wisdom, kindness, beauty and so on. The true self possesses power to believe in others and to live independently. However, when people get hurt and disappointed in relationships, they start to develop defensive ‘false self’. They then stop expressing their true feelings and start to accommmodate themselves. The false self is controlled by a negative mind such as uneasiness, fear and doubt. When the false self grows and an eating disorder emerges, people start to hurt their own bodies controlled by unhealthy thoughts about food and weight. Then the ‘sick self’ starts to surface. The sick self prevents them from connecting to other people emotionally. The patient (female) was 17 years old, 161 cm, 33.8 kg at her first visit. She was afraid of being obese and had a distorted image of her own body. Her daily life was controlled by abnormal activities like excessive exercising. In order to block her abnormal activities and help her recover from enlarged sick self, she was hospitalized in an isolated room with restrictions. Because of the treatments, her weight recovered to 45 kg. However, after being discharged, her weight dropped to 36 kg due to excessive exercising, and she was hospitalized again. I think that was because she hadn’t fully recovered from false self filled with uneasiness, fear, and defensiveness against realities. Therefore, I think, her false self enlarged and her sick self surfaced again. Being dependent, blaming, and passive about the treatments, she couldn’t face her problems because the patient's false self overpowered her true self. The patient was not able to express her true feelings and had passive communication patterns due to the fear and uneasiness regarding facing realties. Being involved in her passive communication patterns, the therapist could not help but treated only her false self. So the therapist tried to help her face the realities by explaining that the results of the treatments were dependent upon how she would face them. At the same time, the therapist looked for the way to activate her true self, although that was overpowered by her false self. One day, the therapist came up with an idea to turn her passive reactions into independent actions, and asked the patient, ‘If you can’t decide what kind of treatments you are going to choose, you can let me decide for you. However, the choice is YOUR decision’. The patient agreed to follow the therapist's decision making and, for the first time, she expressed her determination to face the treatments positively by saying, ‘I have to be responsible for the decision because this is MY decision!’. After this incident, the patient stopped blaming others gradually and started to show more independent actions, although her false self sometimes came back to her. She stopped the excessive exercising, which had been very persistent since the beginning, and her weight recovered to 47 kg. She started to say that she felt more comfortable with the treatments. When treating patients with eating disorders, the therapist tends to be involved not only in their sick selves but also in their false selves. However, it is very important for a therapist to bring out the patient's independence based on their true self. I think it is meaningful to try this kind of communication device considering their true selves’ capabilities, which are often overpowered by their false selves.",

These nonverbal modes perform important functions for us, such as sending relational messages, emotional expression, and impression formation.

      "abstract": "The aesthetic appearance of beauty is intertwined with the experience of looking: and this opens up exciting paths for us to explore within the space of the complex dimensions of learning. The act of “taking something of beauty” (or something related to beauty, including its opposites) is driven by curiosity and desire but accompanied by a sense of fear and paralysis; that which attracts us may become monstruously or terribly beautiful, or – to draw on the lexicon of excess associated with beauty – “too beautiful”. There is a sort of unsustainability inherent in beauty. This text explores the dimension of envy, so understood, starting from its ethical declension, bordering with the dimension of justice; in this case, envious glance is rather a questioning look; it wonders, that's to say, how the merit of other's success happened. Envy produces questioning not as about the effects, as about processes. But often the destroying power of the envious glance reaches instead the need of an act of power (a visual one or trough the vision) of the action of other's beauty. It may be the subject of the educational relationship or the subject of learning. These declensions of the envious glance are analysed starting from literature, from myth and from the iconography connected to the power of looking.",

Conversations with people diagnosed with moderate to severe Alzheimer’s disease are shown to reflect a host of intact cognitive and social abilities, but because these are so poorly understood, the ability of people with the disease to interact with and find meaning in their social world and in their own lives is often underrated. This can lead to their being treated in dysfunctional ways, further exacerbating their difficulties and compromising the efforts of care partners. Conversely, recognizing cognitive abilities in Stern’s sense can lead to an enhanced quality of life for both people with Alzheimer’s disease and those who care for them.",

Of interest to researchers is that this person can have what seems to be a perfectly normal health, both mentally and physically. The loss of meaning of life is a hidden killer; it is like a worm eating the apple from within. A total loss of meaning always signifies a major life crisis or even a life coming soon to its end, but most often meaning of life is only partially lost. This partial loss is really much more tricky than a total loss because people set up mental defenses that hinder them from noticing the loss. After a while, the lack of meaning of life will be materialized in poor quality of life, mental and somatic symptoms, including depression or pain, and reduced ability to function sexually, socially, and in work. When carefully examined in the holistic clinic, most patients evidence a problem with their meaning of life; so, in this area much work can be done, greatly benefiting the patients.",

Diplomacy is bargaining; it seeks outcomes that, though not ideal for either party, are better for both than some of the alternatives. In diplomacy each party somewhat controls what the other wants, and can get more by compromise, exchange, or collaboration than by taking things in his own hands and ignoring the other's wishes. The bargaining can be polite or rude, entail threats as well as offers, assume a status quo or ignore all rights and privileges, and assume mistrust rather than trust. But whether polite or impolite, constructive or aggressive, respectful or vicious, whether it occurs among friends or antagonists and whether or not there is a basis for trust and goodwill, there must be some common interest, if only in the avoidance of mutual damage, and an awareness of the need to make the other party prefer an outcome acceptable to oneself.",

Evolved behavior, including that of other animals, is not entirely devoid of normativity, however. Defining normativity as adherence to an ideal or standard, there is ample evidence that animals treat their social relationships in this manner. In other words, they pursue social values. Here I review evidence that nonhuman primates actively try to preserve harmony within their social network by, e.g., reconciling after conflict, protesting against unequal divisions, and breaking up fights amongst others. In doing so, they correct deviations from an ideal state. They further show emotional self-control and anticipatory conflict resolution in order to prevent such deviations. Recognition of the goal-orientation and normative character of animal social behavior permits us to partially bridge the is/ought divide erected in relation to human moral behavior.",

We arc all aware that not everyone will appreciate the painting or articulate its meaning in the same way; we admit that in most cases, to be able to “see” the significance of various motifs in the work of art requires training or at least exposure to certain cultural artifacts. If the artist intended to evoke specific themes by incorporating into the painting salient elements associated with earlier works of art, then viewers unacquainted with those other paintings would fail to “see” these allusions; they would be “missing” something that is “there” for those trained to notice it. Of course, this is not a permanent handicap; viewers can be instructed to see things they did not “see” before. Just think of the recorded tours a person may listen to while touring an exhibit: the oral tour guide “points things out” that one may not have known before, after which one “sees” the work of art in a new light.",

Any given system of classification must give rise to anomalies, and any given culture must confront events which seem to defy its assumptions. It [the culture] cannot ignore the anomalies which its scheme produces, except at risk of forfeiting confidence. (1) I. When a horse, a cow, a dog, or a grizzly bear is killed under the authority of the government, or by a private party in a planned euthanasia, the veterinarian performing the execution will follow euthanasia guidelines adopted by the American Veterinary Medical Association (AVMA Guidelines) for the method of euthanasia to be used, including any drugs, restraints, and anesthetics required, so that the pain to the animal is minimized. (2) AVMA Guidelines are directed to the humane death of animals: It is our responsibility as veterinarians and human beings to ensure that if an animal's life is to be taken, it is done with the highest degree of respect, and with an emphasis on making the death as painless and distress free as Euthanasia techniques [for animals] should result in rapid loss of consciousness followed by a cardiac or respiratory arrest and ultimate loss of brain function. In addition, the technique should minimize distress and anxiety experienced by the animal prior to loss of consciousness. (3) AVMA Guidelines provide a technical description of stimuli, neural pathways, receptors, feedback, and other scientific topics and terminology before focusing on a description of the anticipated pain for the animal and its prevention. Guidelines explain that the sensation of pain results from nerve impulses reaching the cerebral cortex via ascending neural pathways. (4) Therefore, the Guidelines continue, to the best of our knowledge, pain is perceived only under certain circumstances: On the basis of neurosurgical experience in humans, it is possible to separate the sensory-discriminative components from the motivational-affective components of pain. For pain to be experienced, the cerebral cortex and subcortical structures must be functional. If the cerebral cortex is not functional because of hypoxia, depression by drugs, electric shock, or concussion, pain is not experienced. Therefore, the choices of the euthanasia agent or method is less critical if it is to be used on an animal that is anesthetized or unconscious, provided that the animal does not regain consciousness prior to death. (5) The AVMA is fully committed to the concept that, whenever it becomes necessary to kill any animal for any reason whatsoever, death should be induced as painlessly and quickly as possible. (6) AVMA Guidelines summarize contemporary scientific knowledge on euthanasia in animals and call attention to the lack of scientific reports assessing pain, discomfort, and distress in animals being euthanatized. (7) AVMA only cites well-supported sources. (8) Therefore, [m]any reports on various methods of euthanasia [that] are either anecdotal, testimonial narratives, or unsubstantiated opinions are not included in their list. …",

      "title": "Lessons from Art Theory for the Psychology of Religion",
      "abstract": "Certain concepts in the theory of art might be applicable to the psychology of religion, particularly when one realizes that in ontogenesis the individual tends to be introduced at once to art and religion. This paper describes first the reciprocal reinforcement between art and religion in childhood and subsequent cultural experience. It goes on to suggest that significant understanding of religion can be gained from a systematic application of the art-theoretical constructs of craft, imagination, and illusion. The dubious status of satisfaction (or pleasure and pain experiences) in art and religion is surveyed, leading to the proposal that the numinous satisfaction of religion has a unique, irreducible quality. L ike most other people, I was introduced to religious ideas and attitudes through stories told to me by adults. These stories were either spontaneously narrated by my parents, or read from illustrated and nicely bound books which were held reverentially on the narrator's lap; when not in use, these books stood in a special place outside the regular bookcase. Some of the stories were highly dramatic, having to do with the spurious origins of mankind in a peculiar, naked man who had to lose a rib to gain a wife before they could jointly beget children; a global flood from which only one family and a shipload of animals survived; an oppressed, enslaved, and then wandering people who after much hunger and thirst slowly got established in a land of milk and honey; an endless series of wicked kings; encounters between true and false prophets; violent wars and disasters; a child growing up in the precinct of a temple; the birth of a divine child coupled with a story of the mass murder of many ordinary babies and the appearance of surrealistic beings worthy of Gabriel Garcia Marquez's imagination; miraculous interventions by a strange man in the natural course of events; this man's cruel and untimely death, followed by his unexpected and uncanny reappearance; and the sea voyages of another man, once blinded, with a sense of mission, exposed to the perils of shipwreck and deportation. Whatever literature may be, I certainly was exposed from babyhood to many of its forms, without knowing their names: drama, epos, myth, short story, and poetry-all in the course of being taught religion.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, philosophers bent on defending physicalism have been attracted to the notion that apparently nonphysical features of our world supervene on its physical features. Mental and moral properties, for instance, though not perhaps identifiable with or reducible to physical properties, are thought nevertheless to depend on, and to be determined by, physical properties. More generally, supervenience claims are taken to range over collections or “families” of supervenient properties (A-properties) regarded as depending on distinct families of subvenient B-properties. I shall designate claims of this sort “A/B-supervenience” claims. Sometimes the supervenience relation is distilled into a pair of slogans: “No A-difference without a B-difference”; “Two objects identical with respect to their B-properties must be identical with respect to their A-properties.”",

What sort of epilogue does becoming demand as its proper due, so that the differences on which it thrives are not betrayed? In the introduction, I suggested that becoming is betrayed every time we attempt to pin it down to a few fundamentals or principles that purport to explain the phenomenon under consideration; whether this is kinship, the state, religion, the person, etc., in this or that part of the world makes very little difference. The attempts that betray becoming do so for they ultimately explain it away, conflating the provision of explanation with what still demands our full attention. If, on the contrary, knowledge is to be taken as provisional and forever deferred, this is because there is always something that remains, something that never gets absolutely solved, something that cannot be subsumed by the categories and the measures we have invented for the world. This ever-unfolding and evercirculating ‘something’ is definitely not, my argument has been, a fundamental or an essence but an excessive and elusive figure that assumes many shapes and forms, passing through all of them.",

      "abstract": "This chapter is about addiction: why it is difficult to give up a way of life that has become destructive or to relinquish certain ways of reacting, including symptoms, which have gained a hold despite being unwanted. It is also about how people give up their addictions, and therefore about what therapists can do to help them. It will turn out that overcoming an addiction is rarely a matter of vanquishing it but more often a matter of giving in to a realization of the need for something bigger and more powerful than oneself, a process that Heidegger terms ‘releasement’ (von Deurzen, 1997). The word ‘addiction’ is used advisedly here, even though it is no longer fashionable. It has generally been replaced by the words ‘dependency’, as in chemical dependency, or by the term ‘misuse’, as in substance misuse. Dependency connotes a particular image of someone who is needy and dependent on other people. There is no evidence that these personality traits are particularly linked to becoming addicted, however. Misuse does not capture the imperative nature of the problem. Heroin, as an illicit substance, is misused every time that it is used. Yet there are people who manage to confine their heroin use to a level which they would not consider to be problematic. The ‘demandingness’ of heroin addiction – its admixture of pleasure and self-destruction – is not really conveyed by the much more neutral term, ‘misuse’, which could apply equally well to the recreational user.",

      "abstract": "If an agent is to be moved to action, then two requirements have to be fulfilled: first, the agent must possess beliefs about the way things actually are, about the actions possible given the way things are, and about the likely effects of those actions on how things are; and, second, the agent must have or form desires to change the way things are by resorting to this or that course of action. The beliefs tell the agent about how things are and about how they can be altered; the desires attract the agent to how things are not but can be made to be. This rough sketch of beliefs and desires is widely endorsed in contemporary philosophy; it derives in many ways from the seminal work of the eighteenth century Scottish philosopher David Hume. The striking thing about it, from the point of view of desire, is that it characterizes desire by the job desire does in collaborating with belief and thereby generating action: it characterizes desire by function, not by the presence of any particular feeling. The account raises a host of questions. Is desire an entirely different sort of state from belief, for example, and from belief-related states like habits of inference? Does desire have to answer to the considerations of evidence and truth that are relevant to belief and inference? How does desire relate to preference and choice? And how does desire relate to the values that we ascribe to different courses of action and that influence us in what we do?",

This article discusses the dysfunctionality of guilt and remorse. The model presented employs the theoretical framework of cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy for the understanding and remediation of the remorseful client's dysfunctional guilt. As less-than-perfect individuals, we are more than aware that to err is human. What may not be as readily obvious is that the remorse and guilt often accompanying such personal failure or mis-performance is both needless and dysfunctional. As Ellis (1975) noted, to forgive . . . leaves one sane and realistic. Certainly there are instances where one's twinge of guilt or remorse over the performance of an ill-deed serves to motivate the individual to learn from the past and thus modify behavior. Under such conditions one could argue that the discomfort of guilt is functional. Too often, however, an individual's sense of guilt is such that it is a paralyzer, not a motivator; it is an immobilizer, not an energizer; it is destructive, not productive.",

      "title": "On Teaching",
      "abstract": "On Teaching Earl Rovit (bio) Every occupation has its peculiar provenance—its characteristic setting, workplace, ambient conditions, time strictures, tone of engagement. And each has, as well, its special performance-components: on the one hand, the measure of efficiency with which the task is accomplished; and, on the other, the effectiveness with which the performer incarnates and projects the particular role defined by his labors. Or, to put it more succinctly, each occupation obliges the worker to do something and/or to be something. Clearly the nature of the task will dictate the extent to which performance will be result-oriented or process-oriented: the engineer performs well when his procedures lead to the construction of a bridge that will support the required weight; the ballerina performs well when the projected lines of motion and [End Page 123] stasis which her body carves into temporary space elicit a positive emotional or aesthetic response from her audience. Inasmuch as all human beings can be defined by their subjectivity (\"A man must know himself to be a necessary actor\"—Emerson), this double-pronged meaning of performance will always come into play in human behavior. To do and to be are—more often than not—quite different kinds of performance enacted simultaneously. Perhaps this is why so much of what we do is a little bit similar, even when it is very different. And this is also why it is so rare to find a single criterion that will adequately describe or evaluate any particular activity. \"He performed the operation superbly, but unfortunately the patient died.\" \"The awkward amateurism of the young enthusiastic cast imparted an infectious vitality to the production.\" In our zeal to find unambiguous standards by which to measure the complexities of human behavior, we are all too inclined to distort by oversimplification and to overlook or conceal the biases of our definitions. And especially since the arena of activity is more interpersonal and less susceptible to the methodologies of quantification—politics, art, education—confusion is guaranteed to be thrice confounded, and predetermined interest will easily overcome logic in how we judge what we are doing. My special concern—and one in which I harbor few illusions of objectivity—is education, the occupation which, as a professor of English, I confessed to for some forty years on my annual irs tax returns. In those four decades I estimate that I taught fifteen to twenty thousand hours to some eight to ten thousand students on three continents in a variety of institutions of higher learning. That is to say, I spent those working hours talking, listening, scrawling in red ink within narrow margins, and scratching on blackboards that increasingly became green as my hair grayed into white. To be sure, I spent about four times that many hours reading, preparing, and mulling over what I might actually do in the classroom, but these were not what lawyers would regard as billable hours. Some few of my student army must have learned something in those hours in which—sometimes with sincere passion, sometimes on cruise-control, sometimes with calculated forethought, sometimes on pure impulse—I lectured, questioned, proposed, advised, argued, defended, attacked, digressed, corrected, teased, evaluated, analyzed, sermonized, pronounced, and tried to cajole the passing minutes into the semblance of a conversation. Sometimes—probably too often—I spoke only to myself, hoping that I might be overheard, hoping that some of my auditors might be stimulated into dialogues within their own minds. Sometimes I aimed at little more than a vaudeville turn of self-entertainment which might provoke a disturbance or interruption in the natural sleep that is the student's inalienable birthright. And sometimes I had the effrontery to assume the role of authority, declaiming ex cathedra—as though I or anyone else could become the author of another's private monologue. Were I to have been asked, and were I to have answered with total honesty, [End Page 124] I would have had to admit that very often I didn't have a clue what I was doing, nor, having done it, what, if anything, I had accomplished. Certainly the retention of memorizeable data, the establishment of some rudimentary structures...",

Under the impact of globalization, ICT, and flexibilization, however, the character of institutions has changed. Pre-modern 'thick' institutions have developed into modern, or perhaps post-modern, 'thin' institutions, which in many ways resemble networks.

      "abstract": "The central problem facing contemporary societies, or group of problems, arises not from the existence of either of these social types in themselves, but from the tensions generated by the shift from one to the other and by their coexistence within what are, by other and obvious criteria, single societies. Once upon a time mankind lived, by and large, in closed intimate communities, governed by practices simultaneously geared both to maintaining internal order and adjusting to nature (with the former consideration, however, predominating). The criteria adapted for judging the acceptability of practices – morally, technically, ritually, grammatically, sartorially, what you will – were, so to speak, self-validating, traditional. They were not systematised; no attempt was to deduce them either from some supposedly self-evident general premise or from some single authoritative revelation. So, by and large, such communities conformed to the model elaborated by the organic or romantic theorists.",

      "abstract": "Virtuous violence theory proposes that the perpetrator intends to harm or kill in order to constitute a social relationship to make it correspond with a prescriptive model of what the relationship ought to be – what it must be made to be. For our purposes, a social relationship consists of complementarity between the actions of the participants: each participant’s actions fit previous actions by the other and presuppose “fitting” actions by the other(s), such that the actions of each are incomplete without the congruent action by the other(s). That is, the acts of each are part of a whole that none of them can bring off alone. We encompass in the terms “act” and “actions” not simply the morphology of movements, but also, crucially, the participant’s intentions, moral judgments, and motives (often consciously experienced as emotions). Furthermore, each participant implicitly or explicitly aims to induce completion of her acts: she intends to motivationally evoke and morally invoke the congruent actions that will complete or dynamically sustain the jointly constructed pattern. That is, a participant expects the other(s) to do their part, in the predictive sense, in the hopeful sense, and in the evaluative sense of judging the others’ actions according to how well they complete the intended gestalt. A football game is only football if the opposing players hit each other as hard as they can; the offense can only play offense, blocking and knocking down defenders, against a tackling defense.",

      "title": "Method to madness",
      "abstract": "My work deals with dualities of the human condition such as the physical world and the metaphysical world, order and chaos, the familiar and the foreign, specificity and ambiguity, certainty and uncertainty, reality and fantasy, etc. These opposing forces often seem contradictory yet are coexistent. I am interested in investigating these dualities and blurring the boundaries between them in order to show their interconnectedness. The representation of the figure refers to the fact that our observations of the natural world and our perceptions are a result of our human consciousness. The vast majority of our endeavors are a means to understand something about our human existence. We strive to mesh abstract ideas with tangible observations and practices. This is driven by and understood in terms of our humanity. It is nearly impossible to step outside of our humanness. The figures in this body of work act as a way to at least step back and attempt to view ourselves from a distance. Familiar objects such as doors, windows, chairs and bottles also root the work in reality and act as a point of entry through which one can contemplate more metaphysical issues of human existence. Such objects are chosen for their universality and heavily weighted symbolic meanings. In an art context, these objects become metaphors that transcend their physicality. For example, a door is not simply a door, but can represent the transition into a different ways of perceiving reality. The video section of the installation is a way to further take these everyday objects and situations out of their ordinary context. By overlapping actual footage of people interacting with these objects and juxtaposing unlikely and impossible situations, the video describes more the landscape of the mind instead of reality as we know it and would expect it to exist. This shows the multiplicity of possibilities that could exist and suggests that reality is not as fixed as we often assume it to be. Another important element in my work is the mythology of the artist. This is portrayed by the installation of the artist's studio. In this gallery setting we see not only the artwork, but also a recreated environment in which the artist works. This installation becomes a kind of self-portrait that describes more about the inner workings of the mind of the self than could any portrayal of the physical appearance of the artist. The collection and systems of organization of the materials show the process of thought manifested through material objects. This portrayal of the mythology of the artist is representative of the archetypal struggle in the pursuit of truths. However, the obsessive and irrational portrayal in this installation, bordering on insanity, shows the fragility of the human mind and its incapability to understand the ultimate truth in its entirety. The more we dissect and analyze our reality the more exponentially intricate it becomes and at times can seem overwhelming and futile. This does not deter me from investigating various nuances of human existence.",

      "title": "8. You Are Given Your Name, So You Won’t Be Lonely",
      "abstract": "Abstract The overall premise of this concluding chapter is that human relations can never be stable. Whether they are biologically or socially structured (usually these categories overlap), relations require nurturing, care, and attention. They also require uncertainty, the potential to fail, as well as loneliness and longing. Discussing utterances and tactical use of kinship terminology, personal names, and nicknames, this chapter discusses how relations in Illorsuit (pseudonym) continually re-invoked and negotiated. Some relatives may cease to address each other using appropriate kinship terminology; sometimes out of spite, other times out of respect. Others may long for the return of a dead ancestor so much that they end up willing their return, while others are content with the sporadic moments in which their dead relatives make themselves known in young children. Either way, an ideal model of kinship in Illorsuit (pseudonym), must be able to accommodate for the un-ideal and the instability and uncertainty inherent in human relationships. The chapter finally draws on the Figure-Ground reversal as one such model, arguing that ideal kinship in Greenland is simultaneously figure and ground, that is, relatedness and loneliness at the same time.",

      "title": "John Dewey on the art of communication",
      "abstract": "John Dewey once wrote: Of all affairs, is most wonderful. For him is highest of arts of life, for it is in that society is born and nurtured. It is by that we discover possibilities of nature. And it is through that we make our shared experience meaningful. It is no wonder, then, that Dewey would conclude The Public and Its Problems with this provocative statement: Democracy will have its consummation when free social inquiry is indissolubly wedded to of full and moving communication.Dewey, however, does not adequately explain what he understands by the of full and moving and never tells us how communication functions in varied contexts of practical life. Despite, then, his obvious affection for communication, he leaves many questions about it unanswered. For instance, what makes possible? In what kind of situations is called for and why? How does an inchoate feeling or idea find concrete embodiment in language? What are connections among language, communication, thought, feeling, and action? Most importantly, what is process by which one employs of to influence beliefs and behaviors of others? This dissertation addresses these questions by approaching Dewey's thinking on from a distinctly rhetorical perspective. Even though Dewey almost never mentions in his entire corpus, I argue that it is precisely absence of term from his writings that makes a rhetorical reading of his work all more imperative. Such a reading permits us to understand practical importance of art of in larger context of his social thought. If, then, problem with Dewey's writing on is that it often drifts into abstractions, one remedy is take those abstractions and place them into concrete situations, where is required to transform some part of environment through transaction with human thought and action. Because this kind of activity has been specific domain of rhetoric since time of sophists, it is only appropriate to read Dewey's work through that tradition.In effect, goal of this dissertation is to explicate Dewey's theory of in terms of a rhetorical theory. But insofar as his thought went through three distinct periods in his lifetime, beginning with his Idealistic period in 1880, moving into his Experimental period in 1903, and culminating in his Naturalistic period in 1925, Dewey can be said to have had three implicit rhetorical theories. To articulate and explain each of these theories, I trace Dewey's theoretical development through time and construct, through published works, private correspondence, and biographical material. I show that first theory envisioned rhetoric as a form of eros that helps us grow towards Absolute self consciousness. The second theory views rhetoric as a form of critical inquiry whose goal is development of phroncsis, or practical wisdom. The third theory treats rhetoric as a productive technc, or a naturalistic form of that has power to transform experience, nature, and society through its transactional character.By tracing Dewey's theoretical development and explicating three implicit theories of rhetoric in his writings, this dissertation not only provides a unique perspective on Dewey's changing views on language, ontology, and social practice, but also demonstrates how each theory can still be effectively used to interpret and guide of rhetoric. This kind of work enables us to grasp different facets of this diverse and vibrant art. At same time, it shows how Dewey's work remains an important resource for those who wish to promote and sustain a democratic way of life by educating citizens in of full and moving communication.",

Perhaps most obvious are the superhuman powers of some and the extraordinary adventures of all characters in this genre. Just as salient as supernatural traits, however, is the predictable, repetitious quality of fairy-tale characterization. In fact, part of what distinguishes fairy tales is that they draw on a set of stock characters – fairies, ogres, tricksters, princes, princesses, and the like – who perform similar (nearly identical) tasks from text to text. So predictable and so repetitious are they that critics have often noted the one-dimensionality of fairy-tale characters. Usually devoid of individuating psychological traits, protagonists and antagonists alike highlight specific narrative and ideological functions. In other words, they are first and foremost incarnations of cultural values. They purvey the norms of the community and reject those of the individual.",

It pursues this argument via a close consideration of Derrida’s thought, and especially his discussion of the concepts of perjury, testimony, and oath in his later work. It shows that, for Derrida, precisely because the other, or some crucial aspect of the other, remains absolutely other (unknown, opaque, a secret), every interaction presupposes an oath to say what one means and believe what the other says. Put differently, and paradoxically, our capacity for deception that compels us to trust or have faith in one another. This is an aspect of Derrida’s work that is often confused with a ‘religious’ or ‘theological turn’ in his later writings.",

This Latin term, however, does not share the assumption of these modern terms that the individual who moves out of a community (the exul) does so involuntarily, and that in more cases than not this departure is required or sanctioned by the community’s authorities or legal system. Ancient Greek terminology also observes different boundaries. The verb φεύγω, ‘I go into exile’, also has the meaning ‘I flee’ and ‘I run away from’, and in both senses the group or individual who φεύγει may do so voluntarily or unwillingly, and the thing or person which prompts evasive or fugitive action need have no legal or authoritative backing. Hence, the ancient Greek discourse on exile cannot be considered in isolation from the similar discourses on other forms of displacement such as fleeing, migrating and engaging (less than willingly) in travel.1",

      "abstract": "Autonomy, we suppose, is self-regulation or self-direction. There is a distinct idea that is easily confused with self-direction, namely, self-expression, self-fulfillment, or self-realization. (I do not mean to suggest that the latter three terms are all synonymous. But in this essay, whatever differences there are among them play no role, so I will use them interchangeably.) Although it will turn out paradoxically that autonomy is neither self-regulation nor self-realization, it is reasonable to suppose that the former is a superior candidate. My teacher of Indian religion, Dr. Subodh Roy, blind from birth, chose not to undergo an operation that would have made him sighted because he believed, perhaps rightly, that the ability to see would interfere with his religious quest. He thereby chose not to realize one of his fundamental human capacities, one whose cultivation has produced some of the finest fruits of civilization. Joseph Raz describes a case in which a man places his life in jeopardy by undertaking a trip to deliver medical aid to a group of people in a distant place. Since he will be unable to secure food for several days, he, in effect, subordinates one of his own basic needs or interests to a goal that he deems more important. There is no reason to believe that, in refusing to express or realize a dimension of self, either Dr. Roy or Raz's philanthropist have failed to act autonomously.",

      "title": "Influence of Spirituality on Quality of Life among Adults",
      "abstract": "The English word 'spirit' is derived from the Latin word 'spiritus' which means air, life or courage. Referring to this concept it may be said that spirituality is a way to discover the meaning of our life and to live with a faith that provides courage to face adverse circumstances. It is a subjective and elusive phenomenon that enables people to find out the reason of their existence. Many people confuse spirituality with religiosity but spirituality is a broader, overarching domain that may include religiosity, but religiosity is not a necessary element of spirituality (Cooper- Effa, Blount, Kaslow, Rothenberg, & Eckman, 2001 ; Estanek, 2006). Religion refers to the means and methods (i.e., rituals or prescribed behaviors) of the search that receive validation and support from within an identifiable group of people. According to Koenig, McCullough and Larson (2001) is the personal quest for understanding answers to ultimate questions about life, about meaning, and about relationship to the sacred or transcendent, which may (or may not) lead to or arise from the development of religious rituals and the formation of community. It may be said that spirituality is a set of beliefs and practices that can result in a life changing path that makes a person's life meaningful, purposeful. Spirituality has always been viewed as an important factor in realizing an adequate quality of life. Spirituality has been regarded as something that contributes to human flourishing, something that increase the quality of life. For instance Levin(2001) pointed out that spirituality engenders our emotions, thoughts, and beliefs that alleviate distress. Kass (1996) is one of the opinion that tapping one's spiritual core can boast self concept.It is difficult to point out that the term 'quality of life' is used by whom but the term got some references at 9th World Congress of Sociology held at Uppsala in the year 1978 (Szalai,1980;p.7).Quality of Life covers wider aspects of one's life like family, physical health, psychological health, social wellbeing, work etc. Quality of life is the feeling of overall life satisfaction, as determined by the mentally alert individual whose life is being evaluated (Meeberg, 1993, p. 37). The individual's subjective psychological outlook in the presence or absence of physiological and functional burden determines the individual's perceived quality of life (Burckhart & Anderson, 2003; Murdaugh, 1997). Quality of Life refers to a subjective evaluation which is embedded in a cultural, social and environmental context.Purpose of the studyThe present study was designed to assess the spirituality and quality of life of adults.Objectives of the study* To assess the quality of life of high and low spiritual groups;* To determine whether level of spirituality affects Quality of Life.Hypotheses of the study* There exists no significant difference between the quality of life of high and low spiritual groups.* There will be no significant effect of level of spirituality on Quality of Life.MethodParticipantsThe participants of this study was consisted of 60 adults selected from Aligarh city. The adult included the sample were in the age range of 35 to 45 years. The selection of the subjects was based on purposive sampling technique.InstrumentsDaily Spiritual Experiences Scale: It was constructed by Lynn G. Underwood & Jeanne A. Teresi was used. It is consist of 16 items to be rated on 6 point Likert scale ranging from many times a day, to never or almost never. The minimum and maximum scores that can be obtained on item 1 to 14 are 14 and 85 respectively.World Health Organization QOL Instrument: The scale developed by WHOQOL Group was administered. This scale is consists of 26 items that are distributed in four domains like physical, psychological, social relationship and environment. The scoring of domains are scaled in positive direction. …",

      "title": "Emotional tears: What they are and how they work",
      "abstract": "Tears serve ophthalmic functions: They lubricate, nourish, and protect the cornea. Tearers produce tears non-permanently and at relatively low cost. And observers pay attention to the eyes of others and extract from eyes and faces a lot of information about others’ stable and transient characteristics, including their mental states. These background conditions may have led to the evolution in the human lineage of additional signaling functions in tears. Emotional tearing occurs during negative events (e.g., injuries) and positive events (e.g., achievements). Episodes of tearing appear to be united by tearers’ subjective imputation of negative or positive value to certain internal or external events. Knowing the degree to which things enhance or diminish one’s prospects—the value of things—is a pressing matter for humans and other organisms. Value information is produced for internal consumption, to be used by behavior-regulating mechanisms in the focal individual. But some value information is made available, in addition, to other people, through tearing and other forms of verbal and non-verbal communication. Tearing may function as an implicit plea for receivers to minimize the costs imposed on the tearer by nature, by third-parties, or by the receivers themselves—common when the tearer has lower formidability or wherewithal than receivers do. In addition, tearing may exhort receivers to infer and register which things the tearer values, positively or negatively. Here, we characterize tears, describe the game-theoretic logic of bargaining from a position of weakness, outline the computational systems that regulate the production of and responses to emotional tears, and review findings about emotional tearing that are relevant to the signaling hypothesis.",

      "abstract": "I argue that the construction of the social order, as shown by Adam Smith in The Theory of Moral Sentiments, depends on people’s ability to tame their inborn egoism. According to the philosopher’s anthropological assumptions a human being learns through life experiences how to control his selfinterest so that it does not threaten societal existence. During socialization, a human being – still an egoist to some extent – continues role-playing by the use of the psychological mechanisms of empathy and imagination. As a result he develops sympathy, at first, as a reaction to real people’s emotions experienced in a particular context. Finally, he naturally and more and more unconsciously takes under consideration the perspective of an impartial spectator. The gradually developing process brings about consequences that improve social morality, such as control over the expression of intense emotions, which is a condition for experiencing emotional harmony, or a refrain from pursuing one’s self-interest at the expense of someone else, so as not to become a subject of social contempt. One should also bear in mind that none of these consequences was carefully planned in advance nor purposefully executed.",

Background Homebound persons have a significantly higher mortality risk as well as physical and psychosocial burden. A clarification of the term is necessary to develop preventive measures. Design Concept analysis. Data Sources Scientific literature from electronic databases (CINAHL, Medline via PubMed, PsycINFO, PsycArticles, and Scopus) and definitions from online dictionaries. Review Methods Walker and Avant's method was applied to guide the concept analysis. To prevent arbitrary and empty results in determining the attributes, antecedents, and consequences a thematic analysis was carried out. Results Homebound is defined as an enduring condition in which the life-space is reduced to the home, but moving around in the home is possible (by walking short distances alone or by holding on to furniture, or with the help of a stick, walker, or another person). Homebound has six attributes: in need of help in ADL/IADL and in leaving the life-space, powerlessness, life-space confinement, mobility limitation, endurance, and weakness. Physiological instability and physical immobility are antecedents with wide-ranging influencing factors as illness, complexity, burden, and endogenous/exogenous booster. Homebound has also wide-ranging consequences such as the progression of inactivity, physical, psychosocial, and/or spiritual problems. Conclusions The multidimensional concept of homebound modifies the concepts of mobility and immobility. Given the extensive consequences of homebound nurses play a central role in the prevention.",

      "abstract": "The problem of public and private is often thought to be a boundary problem. ‘Public’ and ‘private’ are said to denote separate areas of human endeavour – distinct ‘realms’, ‘spheres’, or ‘spaces’. The task of formulating clear boundaries, however, has proven to be enormously complex. It seems that every attempt at conceptualizing a purely private area of activity runs into a particular kind of difficulty, namely, many of the activities characteristic of the private sphere turn out to be activities toward which no responsible public authority could possibly remain indifferent: abuse within the family, collusion in the business world, criminal conspiracy among friends. It may be, however, that the problem of public and private, conceived as a boundary problem, is thereby misconceived. It would perhaps be better to think of public and private as denoting not primarily – perhaps not at all – separate realms of endeavour but different ways of being in the world, different ‘manners of acting’. To act in a private manner is simply different in character from acting in a public manner. Such a formulation, if pursued with care, would allow us to accept fully the arguments of those who would question the very idea of a private realm, while still permitting us to retain a vigorous and compelling public/private distinction.",

Bevan analyzes the societal conditions, and the institutional emphases which have fed the trend toward fragmentation. In the common-sense epistemology of the West, there has long been a tendency to phrase behavior in goal-directed terms: to refer behavior in all instances to ends, or end-states, which are believed to restore some lack, deficiency, or deprivation in the organism. Once in possession of the notion of value properties, it is clear that they are not specifically \"motivational but, rather, that such relational features of experience and action as are discriminated by that concept will be ubiquitous in psychological functioning.

I argue here that this claim is false and do so as follows. First, I provide an account of the prima facie wrongness of killing individuals (A) – (D). Briefly, I contend that individuals (A) – (D) have a certain property in common, that of having a future of value.

Think, for example, of how different our conscious lives would be without such experiences as joy, anger, fear, disgust, pity, anxiety, and embarrassment. It is uncontroversial that these experiences typically have an intentional content. Anger, for example, is normally directed at someone or something. One may feel angry at one's stock broker for providing bad advice or angry with the cleaning lady for dropping the vase. But it is not uncontroversial that emotional experiences are always intentional. John Searle, for example, remarks, Many conscious states are not Intentional, e.g., a sudden sense of elation ... (1983, p. 2). Moreover, many animals experience emotions and it is natural to suppose that such emotions lack the sophistication of beliefs or thoughts. When a dog experiences delight in seeing its master after an absence of several days, the suggestion that at least part of the dog's experience of delight is a belief (or thought) that its master has returned home seems to import into the experience something that at best is associated with it and perhaps is not really a state to which the dog is subject at all. And even in the case of human beings, emotional experience often does not seem to involve thought. Consider the experience of disgust, to take one obvious example.' Nor is a salient belief required. One may have a strong fear of spiders and yet not believe that spiders typically pose any risk to humans. But if emotional experiences need not involve beliefs or thoughts, then just how are they intentional?2 Recent theories of consciousness have not devoted as much attention to the",

This is obvious from our attitudes towards other human beings. We may be kind and understanding and be recognizing likenesses with ourselves or what we cherish, or we may be hostile and without an ability to recognize any likenesses with ourselves.  As such our attitudes are expressions of emotional dispositions for experiencing things in a specific value-laden way, and values come into existence from the awareness of our attitudes to various things and reflections on their goodness and badness, rightness or wrongness - i.e. whether our attitudes reflect our right values. Values therefore seem to be pondered  attitudes, but his is by far normally the case. Most often values are traditionally accepted ways of viewing what is good and bad and right and wrong to do on this background of values and the actions therefore are not necessarily reflected and in accordance with what might be the right or true values. An examination of the possibly right values involves a deep reflection on human life and the nature of values and that includes all the aspects of human life - i.e. our relationship to nature:  to surrounding nature and to ourselves. We might discover the problematic relationship of human beings to nature on the background of destruction and perhaps hence exploitation and climate-change, but we might also start the other way round and ask which values - and that means which human and cultural conditions made it possible to develop values and attitudes that have over-exploitive and destructive consequences for nature - and ourselves.",

      "abstract": "Human love can be either a passion of the sensible appetite or an act of the will. This second type of love, insofar as it is preceeded by a choice, is also called dilectio . This in turn may be of two types: love of possession (or of a thing), and love of communion (or of a person). By its very nature, the love of a thing is directed to the love of a person, and when this order is upset, certain aberrations make their appearance: either things are loved as if they were persons, or persons as if they were things, or finally persons are loved as persons but without wishing to do anything for them.\r\nThe three requirements for love are: good, likeness, and knowledge. The Good refers to the object of love, which is always some good, either a substance (person) or an adjective (thing). Likeness refers to the subject of love, and is either perfect (person) or imperfect (thing). Knowledge has to do with the relation subject-object, because nothing is loved if it is not first known.\r\nThe four principal effects of love are: union, mutual indwelling, extasis and zeal. Union, to a certain extent anterior to love, is also an effect of love, and the union is real to the extent to which it is possible: «two lovers wish to become one». The mutual indwelling is that by which the lover is in the loved one by knowledge and by desire and in the same way the loved one in the lover, so that each one can say: «I live, rather it is not I, but the other that lives in me». Extasis, or going outside oneself, is due to the fact that the lover is outside himself and lives in the loved one. And finally, zeal is a movement in defence of love, by which everything that threatens love is rejected.\r\nHuman love in the strict sense is the love between man and woman, and is a mixture of the love of a person and the love of a thing, because it refers not only to the souls but also to the bodies, and presupposes the characteristic of exclusiveness that is typical of the love of a thing. But it is also the love of a person and implies by its nature a constancy or endurance until death.",

      "title": "The Surprise of Reaching Out: Appreciated More than We Think",
      "abstract": "People are fundamentally social beings and enjoy connecting with others, sometimes reaching out to others—whether simply to say hello and to check in on how others are doing with a brief message, or to send a small gift to show that one is thinking of the other person. Yet despite the importance and enjoyment of social connection, do people accurately understand how much other people value being reached out to by someone in their social circle? Across a series of pre-registered experiments, we document a robust underestimation of how much other people appreciate being reached out to. We find evidence compatible with an account wherein one reason this underestimation of appreciation occurs is because responders (vs. initiators) are more focused on their feelings of surprise at being reached out to; such a focus on feelings of surprise in turn predicts greater appreciation. We further identify process-consistent moderators of the underestimation of reach-out appreciation, finding that it is magnified when the reach-out context is more surprising: when it occurs within a surprising (vs. unsurprising) context for the recipient and when it occurs between more socially distant (vs. socially close) others. Altogether, this research thus identifies when and why we underestimate how much other people appreciate us reaching out to them, implicating a heightened focus on feelings of surprise as one underlying explanation.",

      "abstract": "I raise the question of responsibility and danger because of the likelihood that being responsible inevitably includes 'something' unresponsible, as well as a concentric movement of will that excludes what is unresponsible and gives increasing power to the forces of will and subjectivity. The subject is strengthened in responsible action. The movement of subjectivity is towards itself as it acts with regard to something other to itself, to which it gives itself. It draws itself towards itself as it draws toward the other. In responsibly choosing to belong to something-be that something a god, another person, a community, or an ideal-the individual is given intensity, a strengthened sense of the future and past, and above all a sense of worldly coherence and meaning. These are good things, and they seem to be excellent things if that to which we are responsible has unqualified worth. Such values are not denied when responsibility is put in question. Further, the question of responsibility's danger does not ask about that to which we are responsible. It asks about the value of responsibility. If we protect responsibility by giving it unquestioned or hardly questioned value, the subject too will continue to enjoy a virtually unqualified value in our thought and action, and we will ignore or denigrate an absence of responsibility that is borne by responsibility. But when responsibility occurs as a question in our thinking, its own movement will be checked in our thought. Perhaps something unresponsible will take place, and perhaps the unresponsible will expose a danger in responsibility, namely that it excludes something vital for the way of being that is to",

      "abstract": "Many objects that we encounter have material qualities: spoons are hard, pillows are soft and jelly dessert is wobbly. Over a life time of experiences, strong associations between an object and its typical material properties may be formed, and these associations not only include how glossy, rough or pink an object is but also how it behaves under force: we expect knocked over vases to shatter, popped bike tires to deflate, and gooey grilled cheese to hang between two slices of bread when apart. Here we ask how such rich visual priors affect the visual perception of material qualities and present a particularly striking example of expectation violation. In a cue conflict design, we pair computer-rendered familiar objects with surprising material behaviors (a linen curtain shattering, a porcelain teacup wrinkling, etc.) and find that material qualities are not solely estimated from the object9s kinematics (i.e. its physical (atypical) motion while shattering, wrinkling, wobbling etc.); rather, material appearance is sometimes pulled towards the native motion, shape, and optical properties that are associated with this object. Our results, in addition to patterns we find in reaction time data, suggest that visual priors about materials can set up high-level expectations about complex future states of an object and show how these priors modulate material appearance. Understanding how high-level expectations are integrated with incoming sensory evidence is an essential step towards understanding how the human visual system accomplishes material perception.",

Spencer admits that our conception of matter is ‘built up or extracted from our experiences of force,’ and that it is only by energy that matter ‘demonstrates itself as existing.’ This second-hand demonstration is, however, perfectly satisfactory to all men, and they never, when of sound mind, refuse to act on their belief. But science must, in considering well its own principles, go much farther than this general creed as to matter. It must believe in different kinds of matter, atoms of different weights, an all-pervading ether, and multitudes of other entities of which it has no better evidence than their observed effects. Science therefore may apply the same reasoning to the human will, to the unseen spiritual world, and to God Himself, if only it can discover effects resulting from their action. It may be profitable to consider here this positive evidence in some of its departments.",

      "title": "Divine Guilt in Aischylos",
      "abstract": "Any attempt to grapple with the issue of divine behaviour towards men in Aischylos or any other Greek thinker must begin with the question of expectations: what do the gods expect from men, and what, if anything, may men expect in return from the gods? A. W. H. Adkins has I think demonstrated clearly that in Homer at least the defining barrier between mortal and immortal is one of degree, not kind; the gods are gods not because of moral excellences or all-encompassing wisdom, but simply by virtue of their greater power. This power, and the capacity to defend it, is the essence of their τιμή , which they guard as jealously as any mortal ⋯γαθός . What is expected of men, therefore, is a healthy respect for divine τιμή , and an avoidance of any action, however innocent, which might seem to lessen divine status. Thus when Hermes in the first book of the Odyssey tells Aigisthos not to kill Agamemnon or to take his wife, he does so qua god, not moral adviser, and Aigisthos' transgression lies foremost in his rejection of that command. In the same way Hesiod's Prometheus offends (several times) against the prerogatives and τιμή of Zeus, and is appropriately punished; that he meant well is irrelevant to Hesiod, nor is there any interest in his rehabilitation. Examples in the lyric poets are by the nature of the genre less abundant, but we may certainly note Stesichoros 223 PMG , where Tyndareos' accidental slight of Aphrodite draws down the anger of the goddess on his daughters. Similar too is the fate of the daughters of Proitos, whose boast in Bakchylides 11 that their father is wealthier than Hera brings about their subsequent madness.",

It can be better defined as an unmotivated and quasi-ineffable constellation of feelings that convey a nebula of vague sensations and impulses, an uncomfortable feeling characterized by being sorrowful and indignant. The intentional structure that characterizes much of human emotional experience is absent in dysphoria. Emotions are fluxes of intentionality that innervate the flesh and connect it to the world. Dysphoria is an emotional state saturated with a brimming constellation of feelings without any explicit object or target, a state of tension that may lead to spontaneously vigorous outbursts as well as to pale stagnation or emotional depletion. Dysphoria is empty intentionality devoid of the moderating power of language and representation which fragments the person's representations of herself and of others and inducing painful experiences of incoherence and inner emptiness, threatening feeling of uncertainty and inauthenticity in interpersonal relationships, and excruciating sense of insignificance, futility and inanity of life. Dysphoric persons experience their own self as dim and fuzzy, and feel deprived of a defined identity and unable to be steadily involved in a given life project or social role. But it also entails a sense of vitality, although am aimless and explosive one – a desperate vitality. Dysphoria is felt as a disordered, overwhelming flux which is at the same time a disorganizing and compelling source of vitality. Dysphoria is felt as creative and destructive – a vigour that brings life as well as annihilation: a violent spasm that takes control of the body and a power that expresses vitality in touch with the source of all sensations.",

      "title": "Speculative Philosophy, the Troubled Middle, and the Ethics of Animal Experimentation",
      "abstract": "Speculative Philosophy, the Troubled Middle, and the Ethics of Animal Experimentation The human use of animals, particularly in scientific experimentation, is a highly contentious and vexed question. Passions run deep, and level-headed thinkers often lose their balance and good sense. This in itself is highly interesting. We seem confronted by ultimate issues about the meaning and significance of human and organic life for which we are ill-prepared. It is not just that extreme emotionalists refuse to listen to reason. The reasoners themselves, the philosophers, are deeply divided over how ethically to judge the use of animals. The issue exhibits a more fundamental and pervasive feature of philosophy, ethical theory, and social mores. On ultimate philosophic, ethical, and social matters there is no consensus. The controversy over animal experimentation crucially hinges on the question of the relative value of animal and human life. At one extreme, there are steadfast champions of human welfare and scientific progress who claim that animals have no inherent value or worth and thus are not objects of ethical concern. All value accrues to man or God, and we can use animals as we will, as long as we do not endanger or violate our own humanity. At the other extreme, there are ardent and vocal advocates of animal rights, those broadly in the antivivisectionist tradition, who claim that at least certain animals, if not all life, have an ethical significance comparable to our own. We ought not to use or treat animals in ways that we would not treat human beings. In short, animals are in crucial respects our moral equals. The animal rightists point to undeniable instances of animal abuse and radically call into question the moral justification of animal experiments. They would significantly reduce, if not altogether eliminate, scientific research on animals irrespective of possible human benefits. Then there are those in the troubled middle who find an inherent goodness in organic life and concrete values manifested in individual animals. But they also believe that the relatively superior goodness and value of human life, coupled with our vulnerable and needy status in the world, warrant the ethically judicious use of animals in scientific research. These middle ones recognize the legitimate and often conflicting needs and requirements of both human and animal welfare. In short, they wish to balance the undeniable benefits that result from scientific research with a genuine concern for the well-being of animals. With respect to experimentation, they are the ones most truly vexed by ethical questions of what and how many animals to use; of whether alternatives to animal use are scientifically efficacious and justified; of whether research protocols are sound and important enough to warrant the infliction of harm, suffering, or death; and of how to reduce animal suffering and harm without jeopardizing legitimate benefits that might accrue to both human and animal life. These are questions that typically animate the more ethically concerned members of Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUCs). Under the Animal Welfare Act of 1966, as amended in 1985, The Health Research Extension Act of 1985 (National Institutes of Health), and the animal welfare policy of the Public Health Service (1985), IACUCs are mandated for all institutions receiving federal funds for research on animals. The committees, which have monitoring functions analogous to Institutional Review Boards for human experimentation, oversee the care of laboratory animals and review research protocols for their scientifically legitimate and humane treatment of animals. The general aim of IACICs is to encourage the best and most beneficial scientific research with the least possible animal use and suffering. Yet all is not well with IACUCs. They are plagued by nagging practical and theoretical problems. …",

And souls do act – and feel, perceive, experience and understand, plan, intend, remember and hope. (So the distinction of soul from mind is not just semantic). Consciousness stakes out its ground to constitute itself as an identity, a subject or self, reflexive and reflective, situated in the world and responsive to the risks and opportunities we encounter. The reductive project, aspiring to erase the very idea of the soul in favor of the brain and its processes, runs aground here: As science increasingly succeeds in correlating brain processes with the acts and experiences of our inner life, the facts of subjecthood do not melt away. They remain undescribable in sheerly physical terms, and unexplainable in such terms alone. The agenda here is not separability. This book is not about immortality or ensoulment. The argument is much more direct: that human souls think and feel, believe and choose, reason and discover, not despite the body but by way of its remarkable capabilities. The chief organ, locus, and vehicle of souls is the brain.",

      "title": "Unconscious pupillometry: An effect of “attentional contagion” in the absence of visual awareness.",
      "abstract": "When looking at other people, we can readily tell how attentive (or distracted) they are. Some cues to this are fairly obvious (as when someone stares intensely at you), but others seem more subtle. For example, increased cognitive load or emotional arousal causes one's pupils to dilate. This phenomenon is frequently employed as a physiological measure of arousal, in studies of pupillometry. Here, in contrast, we employ it as a stimulus for social perception. Might the human visual system be naturally and automatically engaging in \"unconscious pupillometry\"? We demonstrate that faces rendered invisible (through continuous flash suppression) enter awareness faster when their pupils are dilated. This cannot be explained by appeal to differential contrast, differential attractiveness, or spatial attentional biases, and the effect vanishes when the identical stimuli are presented in socially meaningless ways (e.g., as shirt buttons or facial moles). These results demonstrate that pupil dilation is prioritized in visual processing even outside the focus of conscious awareness, in a form of unconscious \"attentional contagion.\" (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved).",

      "title": "The concept of a human action",
      "abstract": "This analysis of the concept of a human action takes its point of departure in the fact that actions are things done by persons. But people do many things which do not qualify as actions. A necessary condition for calling something done an action, is that the agent intends or means something by it, in the sense that the agent has some specific end in mind. Thus an action may be said to be the externalization, realization, or expression of the agent's meaning. But what precisely are such meanings or intentions that are given expression in actions? How are they to be distinguished from other mental contents ? The author tries to answer these questions by distinguishing them, on the one hand, from experiences, sensations, feelings, and, on the other hand, from other thoughts and meanings that do not find expression in the action. It is claimed that this account of action explains many characteristics of actions: that actions are appraised, not described (because meanings are evaluated), that an action is regarded as a unity (because the meaning is a unity), that the intention and the performance are not causally related, but related as are the content and expression of linguistic utterances, etc.",

      "abstract": "Along with the notion of being a person (zuo ren 做人), the notion of doing business (zuo shi 做事) in ordinary Chinese is basically an over-all notion of the norms in the practical and associative activities, carrying typically obscure meanings on practice and association affairs in some external world. Ordinary Chinese not only distinguishes these two notions but also defines a dictionary order of them, with the affairs of the internal world prior to those of the external. The fact that the notion of doing business refers to business (shi 事) rather than person (ren 人) makes this order clear at a deeper level. It shows that this notion regards the practical affairs of the external world less important to the person itself than those of the internal. Except for these qualities, the notion of doing business holds some normative meanings, although contains no definite rules. These meanings indirectly relate to the notion of person that people form in their private associations and emerge as some mixture with a tactical attitude out of the need of earning a life. The notion of person gives birth to some obscure requirements, for instance, the requirement of ‘doing business in accordance with your conscience’ and that of ‘doing business seriously’. The core world of family is marginalized in the public transition of associations. There are reasons to anticipate that in this process the notion of doing business will undergo more radical changes than that of being a person.",

      "title": "Duchowy niepokój, czyli o sumieniu słów kilka",
      "abstract": "The concept of conscience is not an unambiguous term and is not infrequently exposed to the danger of reducing its characteristic depth. This danger appears especially where it is understood above all, or, in extreme cases, merely as man’s ability or his specific power involving pronouncing judgements on particular deeds or attitudes, in terms of moral good or evil, passing over, and sometimes even forgetting about what makes it capable, as well as the space in which this distinctive process takes place, thus constitutively belonging to the nature of this specific human reality. An opposed view of understanding of conscience as a judgement, the existentially experienced conscience perceived as distinctive spiritual space marked with the sense of humanness appears – with a privileged place for meetings and growth. Meetings with oneself, with another man and with God, as well as growing in freedom and love, towards complete humanness. What best characterises it is the experience and understanding that authentic self-fulfilment as a person – open with the Absolute, as well as with the whole reality – means our welfare and obligates. The emerging responsibility for oneself calls on to search for forms and ways, not just any, but harmonious with the discovered sense of one’s own existence, in order to accomplish this moral good. Whereas, the gradually emerging horizon of sense, constitutively contributing to man’s moral awareness, not only lightens self-understanding, but also makes us capable of appropriate grasping of the deepest essence of good or evil of our particular decisions. In this way, conscience becomes „the light”, „the guide” and „the judge” of our being, our self-fulfilment in freedom. Many a thing indicate that moral awareness and ability to pronounce specific judgements, though diverse in terms of proprium typical of each of them, indeed constitute one, dynamic and indivisible entity. Breaking it inevitably leads to limiting, and sometimes even distortion of one’s own humanness.",

      "abstract": "We can and do reflect in very general terms on human beings and their place in the world, and we do so for a number of reasons and in a variety of ways. We can notice similarities between human beings and other parts of nature, or differences between them and most other things, or even respects in which they are unique in the world as we know it. Human beings are born and grow and they decline and die. They are the only things in the universe who laugh. Human beings also act. Unlike rocks on a mountainside or branches of a tree, they do not just move, they do things. Other animals also do things, but humans differ from them in the extent to which they think about what to do, and then act as a result of that deliberation. And, not coincidentally, human beings also know things about the world around them. Knowledge is essential to deliberation and to informed action. No one would deny or question these sweeping platitudes about human beings and the human condition. It is equally uncontroversial that humans can become curious and reflect on some of these very general features of human life and try to understand them better. This could be called in the most general sense. Not simply the study of this or that group of human beings, or of this or that social or cultural arrangement among them, but anthropology as the study of human beings in general, or of apparently universal features of human beings or human life as such. If we take an interest in human action in general we might ask what it takes for an event or a movement to count as an action performed by an agent, and how such a thing is possible. The question can be found especially pressing once we acknowledge certain other general facts of the world and understand them in a certain way. Human agency must be understood as occur-",

      "title": "Metabolic karma in diabetes care: Medico-philosophical reflections",
      "abstract": "Sir, The concept of metabolic karma, as described in the editorial by Dr Kalra and colleagues,[1] is a multilayered one. The definition of karma (action; destiny) overlaps with kriya (action) and dharma (duty; constitution). This is true for diabetes care as well. Indian philosophy, as propounded by Lord Krishna, clearly states that one should engage in one's occupation, and fulfill his or her dharma. Although there are bound to be imperfections, this should not make us stop working. Thus, the diabetes care professional, whose dharma (duty) is to practice diabetes care, should strive to do his or her best, irrespective of all odds and challenges. “Better is one's own duty, though devoid of merit than the duty of another well performed; for performing the duty ordained by his own nature, man does not incur sin.” Bhagavad Gita 18:47 The Bhagavad Gita compares, at length, the relative importance of gyaan yoga (knowledge) and karma yoga (action or practice). While both these types of yoga are important in their own right, it is best if concordance is achieved between knowledge (theory of diabetes care) and practice (clinical diabetes care). This age-old philosophy, in fact, is the bedrock of modern clinical methods. The need for concordance can also be highlighted by viewing “dharma” and “karma” as two sides of the same coin. As long as our actions are in sync with our constitution or duty, we may be able to achieve harmony in life. This, too, reminds the diabetes care professional to follow optimal conduct while managing persons with diabetes. It also reminds us to ensure concordance between our thoughts (knowledge), words (physician-patient communication) and actions (prescription). “Free from attachment, unegoistic, endowed with firmness and zeal and unswayed by success and failure – such a doer is said to be Saattvika.” Bhagavad Gita 18:26 The Bhagavad Gita is a sempiternal example of how cost: benefit, or risk: benefit, analysis is done, and then acted on. Similarly, while choosing strategies for screening, diagnosis, and management, one should assess both anticipated benefit, possible side effects, in an individualized, person centered manner. Mastery of this science, and art is our dharma (righteous duty), our karma (action), and our kriya (work). This will facilitate harmonious achievement of good karma (destiny). Frustration with the lack of adherence or persistence is a fact of life for many diabetes care professionals. Indian philosophy strongly suggests a person-centred approach through these verses of the Bhagavad Gita. We would do well to internalize this wisdom. As diabetes care professionals, we should work, to the best of our ability, without expectation of reward. “Thus, has this wisdom, more profound than all profundities, been imparted to you by Me; deeply pondering over it, now do as you like.” Lord Krishna to Arjuna; Bhagavad Gita 18:63.

The other is a social construction that is necessary to serve the political function of organizing society. Accurate information about the other is not necessary to serve this political function. The realityof the other, to the extent it exists, lies within the self and not within any external experiential world. 3. The Other Cannot Define Itself The other, as a social construct, does change, but it changes at the behest of the self. When the self changes, the other changes. The other is an object acted on by the center/self. It is fixed vis-a-vis the self. The other cannot define itself. It is defined by the self. This is what makes the act of self-definition by outsider communities so destabilizing to the existing order. Those who exist in the subordinate position of the hierarchy cannot name and define for themselves without usurping the power of the dominant and ripping the hierarchical structure of self and other apart. 4. The Other Is To Be Feared and Controlled As a manifestation of difference, the other is perceived as a threat. As a threat, the other must be controlled. The establishment of an elaborate structure of control then becomes a necessity. It is necessary because the very concept of otherness symbolically demands it, even if the individual or group marked as other poses no real threat at all. 131.

      "title": "The voluntary operant and the operant nature of volition: Three views",
      "abstract": "Many philosophers, psychologists, and lay folk associate volition with autonomy (actions are independent of an individual's environment) and free will (individuals originate their actions). Most behaviorists hold these views to be incompatible with behavior analyses. The present paper describes volition as interpreted by B. F. Skinner, Howard Rachlin, and Allen Neuringer. Skinner relates volition to positively reinforced operant behavior. That works because, like operants, voluntary actions are free, in the sense of not physically constrained; they affect their environments, often resulting in positive outcomes, and are sometimes unpredictable. Rachlin, while incorporating Skinnerian methods, interprets volition within his own Teleological Behaviorism framework. For Rachlin, reinforcement of an individual response is often incompatible with voluntary control, thereby disagreeing with Skinner. Responses are voluntary only when they are members of extended response patterns. Neuringer also begins with Skinner's operants, but argues that, under the control of reinforcing consequences, both voluntary actions and operant responses are sometimes predictable and other times \"truly\" unpredictable. Neuringer does not assume that environments determine voluntary actions, thereby disagreeing with Skinner and Rachlin. Taken together, the agreements and disagreements among these three behaviorists may help to shed light on the relationship between operants and volition.",

Here we focus on a different structural feature, their connection to a person's self-concept. In 6 studies, we predict and find that people's most enduring regrets stem more often from discrepancies between their actual and ideal selves than their actual and ought selves. We also provide evidence that this asymmetry is at least partly due to differences in how people cope with regret. People are quicker to take steps to cope with failures to live up to their duties and responsibilities (ought-related regrets) than their failures to live up to their goals and aspirations (ideal-related regrets). As a consequence, ideal-related regrets are more likely to remain unresolved, leaving people more likely to regret not being all they could have been more than all they should have been.

Biblical and rabbinic texts reveal that the essential consideration in assessing a person’s humility is not that person’s relative assertiveness or timidity but rather with how much he or she subjugates personal self-interest to higher purposes. As articulated within the Jewish tradition of self-development called Mussar, humility inheres in directing one’s will toward sensitive service of the needs and wants of others within one’s social sphere as well as in line with one’s allegiance to the divine. Virtuous humility expresses itself in everyday contexts in the measure of the “space” (be that in the physical, emotional, verbal, financial, or another realm) that a person occupies. The ideal is to take up just as much space as is necessary to fulfill one’s mission of service in his or her life, neither more nor less. Moses fits (as well as defines) this paradigm.",

      "title": "On the Counterfactual Dimension of Negative Liberty",
      "abstract": "This article explores some implications of the counterfactual aspect of freedom and unfreedom. Because actions can be unprevented even if they are not undertaken, and conversely because actions can be prevented even if they are not attempted and are thus not overtly thwarted, any adequate account of negative liberty must ponder numerous counterfactual chains of events. Each person's freedom or unfreedom is affected not only by what others in fact do, but also by what they are disposed to do. Their dispositions play a key role in determining whether the abilities and inabilities of each person would continue as such if the person's conduct or situation were altered in various respects. Until one knows whether people would or would not have acted in certain ways if a given person had sought to do something, one cannot know whether that person was free to do that thing. Nor can one know whether the person was free to perform that action in combination with manifold subsequent actions. Thus, whether tacit or explicit, counterfactual scenarios are indispensable for any enquiry into a person's liberty. By relying (albeit perhaps only implicitly) on such scenarios, which trace how people are disposed to act vis-a-vis one another, one takes account of the central role of unmanifested dispositions in setting the bounds of people's sociopolitical freedom. Among the principal theorists whose work is critically examined in this article are Hillel Steiner, Ian Carter, and G.A. Cohen.",

Although terms such as self‐mutilation and deliberate self‐harm have also been used for this behavior, NSSI has increasingly become the term of choice. Common examples of NSSI include skin‐cutting, burning, scratching, needle‐sticking, rubbing against rough surfaces, hitting or banging body parts, and interfering with wound healing. In general, behaviors associated with eating disorders (e.g., binging or purging) and substance disorders (e.g., alcohol or drug use) are not considered NSSI, because they are not accompanied by specific intent to physically damage one's body tissue. Similarly, most cases of tattooing and body piercing are not considered NSSI, because they are socially sanctioned forms of body decoration or artistic expression. Importantly, NSSI can be distinguished from suicidal behavior. Unlike suicide attempts, NSSI is not performed with the intent to die, and the injuries caused by NSSI are rarely life‐threatening or medically severe (Klonksy &amp; Muehlenkamp, 2007).",

None of these descriptions reflects well on the torturer or the society condoning the practice.

Not only does the observer need to derive precise information about the various objects under dramatically differing lighting conditions, scales, and vantage points, but the object must also be perceptually individuated from all other instances of that object so that identity can be assigned and the appropriate semantics (and phonology, where relevant) activated. Moreover, all of these processes must be executed accurately and rapidly, notwithstanding the ambiguity of the input arising from the commonality of input features (e.g., all faces have two eyes, a nose, and a mouth in the same spatial arrangement, and all words are made from the same relatively small set of letters). Despite the clear computational challenge associated with object recognition, human observers are remarkably efficient at assigning identity effortlessly and accurately, particularly for faces.",

      "title": "The object ‘university' from a speculative realist perspective",
      "abstract": "From a speculative realist perspective, everything can be seen as an object, that cannot be paraphrased in terms of either its components or its effects (Harman, 2016:3), be it a toothbrush, a disease or a fiction character. Objects have their proper existence, and interact with other objects, independently of human's conscience or action. In parallel, one of the main criticisms against capitalism and managerialism, is that they transform everything into objects (commodification), in a manner that seems improper. The two themes of the stream cross on the matters of object, property, and style. If we take the contemporary university, and its evolution towards ever more managerialism, as our object, what would a speculative realist perspective make us understand? First that the present evolution is not fully forced from outside. The university managerial state or stage is a potentiality present inside the university-object. The evolution can be seen as a phase shift wherein inherent potential is actualized (similarly as depicted by Simondon - another author who attempts to escape from connexionism) or a new symbiosis. In both cases, emphasis is not on actors and actions. Second, this transformation would not be seen as improper, as a smearing of a before purer object, rather has the entry of a new of From this perspective, two themes are emerging: the question of what is proper to the object-university (proper in the double meaning of appropriation and of purity); the question of allure/style of this object. 1/ When Derrida (1985) comments on Francis Ponge's Le parti-pris des choses, he notes that Ponge is trying to speak for / from within / as the things/objects. Not from a human/social perspective. He wants to access the proper of the thing, which in French means both the proper/property and the cleanliness. However, at the moment when he is signing, his effort can be nothing but an appropriation (taking property over and dirtying) and his text becomes a thing. To speak for / from within the object requires the object's auto-affection. Most of the criticism against the becoming-managerial of the university, and the correlative ranking/audit emphasis, is spoken about the scholars' affects, not the university's auto-affection (Letiche and al, forthcoming). This criticism is an appropriation. This raises the question of what is the proper of the object-university? 2/ We feel that one central element of this proper lies in the university's allure. is a special and intermittent experience in which the intimate bond between a thing's unity and its plurality of notes somehow partially disintegrates (Harman, 2005:143). Allure is also a term from Francis Ponge, meaning its speeds and its specific appearance, its style. For Mace (2016), most of what we care and fight for is a question of style. A style is an appearance, a habitus, an habitat and a compound of values. A style is a mode of existence. A style is a source of distinction, of individuation, and also something that may die, and that we might stand for its existence. Those elements will be discussed with the case (the object) of the universities' occupation in Brazil against a cut in resources and a growing emphasis on performativity that may endanger the continuation of a particular style. Governmental decisions are seen as intrusion, expropriation, and becoming-improper. But here criticism are raised in the name of/made by the university ‘it-self'. Seeing the university as an object which cannot be reduced to its components (be they the professors, students, walls), nor to its social effects may provide a perspective different from a pure political game of actors defending their power/privilege/actions.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Any given type of productive activity may lead to a number of distinct patterns of description. First, it may be considered as a combination of goal-oriented operations by means of which material objects take a particular shape according to given specifications, or immaterial services are supplied. Second, productive activity may be described as a combination of ‘transformation stages’ (usually a sequence), which leads material objects or human capabilities from a state of nature that is conventionally considered as original to a different state of nature that is conventionally considered as final. Last, productive activity may be identified with those human and non-human factors that must be available within each productive unit if some process of ‘technical transformation, or production’ (Hicks, 1939: 78) has to take place.",

But the punishments for the various sorts of insolence in speech or action with regard to the gods, which a man can show in word or deed, have to be proclaimed after we have provided an exordium. Let this be it: ‘No one believing, as the laws prescribe, in the existence of the gods has ever yet performed an impious action willingly, or uttered a lawless word.

As a female choreographer, the values of sumbang duo baleh are not only seen in the attitude of her personality, but also in the content her dance work as a reflection of her personality. However, all the twelfe values cannot considered altogether in a dance. If all the content of those values are fully referenced in the dance work, choreographers feels such rules would hamper creativity, especially in the embodiment of motion to the media staple in dance. The values of twelfe improperly behaviors can be implemented into the dance are walk improperly, sit improperly, stand improperly, look improperly, improper clothing, and improper behaviors. On the other hand, the involvement of women in artistic activity, driven by the demands of the economy. For that reason, women no longer have to rely on the man as the leader of the household, or be the responsibility of the system as in the economy in the longhouse, yet can already be anticipated through achievement in art.

Sebagai seorang koreografer perempuan, kandungan sumbang duo baleh tidak hanya terlihat dalam sikap kepribadiannya, namun kandungan nilai-nilai itu juga dapat terlihat dalam karya tari sebagai cerminan kepribadiannya. Kandungan nilai sumbang duo baleh tidak semuanya dapat dituangkan dalam karya tari. Jika semua kandungan nilai-nilai tersebut secara utuh dijadikan acuan dalam berkarya tari, koreografer merasakan aturan-aturan tersebut akan menghambat kreativitas, terutama dalam perwujudan gerak yang menjadi media pokok dalam tari. Adapun kandungan nilai sumbang duo baleh dengan lugas dapat diimplementasikan ke dalam tari adalah sumbang jalan, sumbang duduak, sumbang tagak, sumbang penglihatan, sumbang pakaian, dan sumbang kurenah. Di sisi lain, keterlibatan perempuan dalam aktivitas kesenian, didorong oleh tuntutan perekonomian. Untuk itu, perempuan tidak lagi harus menggantungkan perekonomian sepenuhnya kepada laki-laki sebagai pemimpin rumah tangga, atau menjadi tanggung jawab kaum sebagaimana dalam sistem perekonomian di rumah gadang, namum sudah dapat diantisipasi melalui prestasi dalam berkesenian. Hal demikian pula memicu para koreografer berupaya memenuhi kebutuhan konsumen, bahkan berlomba-lomba untuk menciptakan pasar yang sifatnya komersil.Kata Kunci: Sumbang duo baleh, koreografer, tari",

      "abstract": "This paper addresses the question of how and with what consequences anonymity is used as a creative element in experiments dealing with alternative forms of knowledge production. More specifically, the focus is on a particular current in contemporary dance, experimental dance. This has developed in the course of the 1970s. Its guiding idea is to shift the focus away from finished choreography and performance to the processuality, spontaneity, and experience of dance practice itself. Dance is seen as a laboratory in which to experiment with gravity, body boundaries, group dynamics and perception. The focus is on testing, touching, trying. The corresponding events are called either 'Dance Labs' or 'Movement Research Workshops', depending on the regularity. An instrument that is often used in the context of such events to create specific social situations and group dynamics or to channel perceptions in certain directions is anonymity. Anonymity is broadly understood as the capping of connections that results in a degree of unaccountability with respect to various aspects of a person, situation, or activity. For example, unaccountability can arise from the fact that people can no longer see each other, so that visual identification becomes impossible, even if only temporarily. By breaking familiar modes of identification, other forms of relating can sometimes be emphasized. This is what makes this form of anonymity so interesting for experimental dance.",

The first step towards the aggregation of men into a community, or the first departure from a state of perfect isolation, could that state ever have subsisted for a single day, is the patriarchal arrangement. No sooner indeed is the infant creature ushered into being, than it is met by the cares and the caresses of those who are around it, and who have either attended or welcomed its entry on this scene of existence—as if, in very proportion to the extremity of its utter helplessness, was the strength of that security which nature hath provided, in the workings of the human constitution, for the protection of its weakness and the supply of all its little wants. That there should be hands to receive and to manage this tender visitant, is not more obviously a benevolent adaptation, than that there should be hearts to sympathize with its cries of impotency or distress. The maternal affection is as express an instance of this as the maternal nourishment—nor is the inference at all weakened, by the attempts, even though they should be successful, of those who would demonstrate of this universal fondness of mothers, that, instead of an original instinct, it is but a derived or secondary law of our nature. Were that analysis as distinct and satisfactory as it is doubtful and obscure, which would resolve all mental phenomena into the single principle of association—still the argument would stand.",

Or, if you prefer, superstition is that sort of enchantment or magical power which fear exercises over our soul; the wretched daughter of the imagination, who attacks it with ghosts, dreams, and visions […] It crushes the mind, mainly with illness or adversity; it transforms good discipline & venerable customs into mummery & superficial ceremonies. Once it has put down deep roots in whatever religion it might be, good or bad, it is capable of extinguishing natural enlightenment ( les lumières naturelles ), & of troubling the soundest minds. In short, this is humanity's most terrible scourge. Even atheism destroys no natural sentiments, casts no slur on the laws, or on popular morals; but superstition is a despotic tyrant who makes everything surrender to its flights of fancy. Its prejudices are superior to all other prejudices. An atheist has an interest in the public tranquillity through a love of his own peace of mind; but fanatical superstition , born of a troubled imagination, overthrows empires […] Ignorance and barbarity usher in superstition , hypocrisy maintains it with useless ceremonies, false zeal propagates it, & self-interest perpetuates it. The hand of the monarch is unsure how to put the monster of superstition in chains, & it is from this monster, still more than from irreligion (inexcusable as it is) that the throne should fear for its authority […] Superstition , put into action, properly constitutes fanaticism, see FANATICISM; this is one of the finest and best articles in the Encyclopédie .

      "abstract": "The object plays an important role in human life. Though a man lived in an ethnic society, he followed a barter system because he was dependent on others. Since the barter system was the most difficult method of exchange and involved loss, the commodity value coin and money came into operation as an alternative. Although the object is unstable, the object is necessary to live in the world and cannot be ignored. If there is something in the possession of a person who does not value it, the one who does not care will be respected and valued. The household must have intended to remain established. It is very difficult to earn money. For that reason, it has been customary since then to the present day for the man to leave the woman for the sake of the necessities of life. If everyone wants to live with everything, he has to give it to others and live. When one has wealth, one does not know its value. The value of wealth is known only when you are subjected to poverty. It is better to work hard and live richly rather than to live on credit. It is not the best life. A person who spends more than he needs is a spendthrift. He who does not spend despite the need is a miser, so it is better to spend according to the need and live according to the need. When you spend money in a good way on the right path, it will bring happiness not only to yourself but also to your relatives. Savings are the ones that raise the quality of life of an individual. In 2008, many countries, including the United States, were affected by the global economic slowdown, but India did not suffer that much because of the saving habits of our people that made money a part of life. Now it is only when there is money that life becomes great. People have created an environment in which meaning is very essential for human life.",

      "abstract": "One cannot experience all the consequences of one's action in the span of life. As a result he finds life is full of anomalies. To apply scientific rule of causality in such life affairs the need for upgradation of life is proposed through adaptation of ethical and moral values subjectively per our scriptures. Problems rest for solution on the inner goodness of man. Unless mentality/attitude is upgraded it is like ' you open clinics but not solve the problem of disease '. No laws, economic reforms, political ideologies, social adjustment are of any use if human nature be not improved. If our attitude be honest, nature organises matters in such a way that we shall get requisites and aids for our well being in appropriate occasion. Vedanta offers a high ideal constructive approach to life offering solution of all problems. In this respect Swami Vivekananda's ideals of Vedanta on the following fronts Ethics, Morality, Creation of own destiny, Adaptation of yogas per inbuilt tendencies and Idealism in service are applied so that there may not be any demarcation of secular life from sacred/ spiritual life. As a result of overall upgradation, the life can be under perfect control.",

      "abstract": "The case discussed here illustrates one type of transsexual wish. The paper clarifies the dynamic considerations and treatment process in a patient who was psychotic and who, from time to time, wished to change his sex. One of the patient's chief difficulties was an inability to regulate adequately the intrapsychic distance between the self and objects. In the relatively nonpsychotic state, the patient used coercive behavior and splitting to establish a tenuous balance between fusing with the object and losing it entirely. When these defenses were adequate, the patient did not experience wishes to be a woman. However, when threatened with the loss of an important internal object (the mother or therapist), the patient would attempt to fuse with the object by experiencing strong transsexual wishes. The wish thus served to stabilize and control internal objects at a comfortable distance. The wish also served a restitutive function, holding off a frightening psychotic state; a loss of an important object threatened the patient with feelings of fragmentation. It was thus somewhat similar to a delusion or hallucination.",

      "title": "Basic Behavioral Processes Involved in Procrastination",
      "abstract": "Procrastination involves an irrational putting off of engaging in a course of action, in spite of expecting to be worse off for the delay. I suggest that to understand the processes underlying procrastination one should examine its relation to several behavioral procedures that have been studied in humans and other animals. For example, in delay discounting, smaller rewards that come sooner are often preferred over larger rewards that come later. In the context of delay discounting, procrastination can be viewed as the preference for an immediate competing activity over the delay to work on a required task. Another process similar to procrastination can be seen in free operant, temporal avoidance (or Sidman avoidance) in which an animal will receive a shock (a deadline not met) if an interval passes without a specified response (task completion). Once animals learn about the interval, they often procrastinate by waiting until the interval has almost passed before responding. Finally, research with animals suggests that the persistence of procrastination may involve a form of negative reinforcement associated with the sudden decline in anxiety or fear (relief) when the task is completed prior to the deadline. Research with animals suggests that the mechanisms responsible for human procrastination may involve systems that derive from several procedures known to produce similar behavior animals.",

      "title": "Twelve Thousand Criminals",
      "abstract": "A study by our psychiatric department of the criminals admitted to the Virginia State Penitentiary has revealed findings that should be of value in a more logical handling of this major community problem. It is fair to say that the criminal as a whole is an inadequate personality. He is inadequate in some phases of his personality development. He cannot or will not meet the problems that present themselves as his adequate neighbor does. In his attempt to maintain security and to carry on his self-preservation, he has not been able to play the game according to the rules and customs that have as their purpose a social orderliness which in turn will give to the individual and to the mass the greatest happiness. The psychiatric department is concerned about the forces motivating abnormal reactions, or crime, in these cases. We have constantly attempted to keep before us the problem of the individual as an organism. Thus, in our present civilization this organism is constantly in a state of reaction to its environment. The way in which one reacts to environment is, as I have observed, more dependent upon the organization of the individual than the stimulus to which one reacts. The monotonous repetition of the stress and strain of unusual circumstances-broken homes, foreign born, feeblemindedness, worry, and financial difficulties-is recorded and tabulated with the greatest exactitude as causative factors of crime. We cannot overlook the large number of individuals who have gone through all of the above so-called causes of crime who have never committed crime. Furthermore, we cannot close our eyes to the fact that the individual who has committed crime continues frequently to commit crime. Thus I cannot help but conclude that criminal reaction is not wholly explained by the nature of the stimulus, but is dependent primarily upon the individualhis original endowments plus the changes which have been caused by past experiences and disease. Crime is motivated by processes of mentation and the forces operating to produce these reactions are to be attacked if we are to prevent crime.",

      "title": "Asian Christian Spirituality: Context and Contour",
      "abstract": "Asian Christian Spirituality: Context and Contour Peter C. Phan In its broadest sense, spirituality refers first of all to the human capacity for self-transcendence actualized in acts of knowledge and love of realities other than oneself. Secondly, and more narrowly, it refers to the religious dimension of life by which one is in touch with the more-than-human, transcendent reality, however interpreted and named (for example, Emptiness, the Holy, the Ultimate, the Absolute, Heaven, or God). Thirdly, and more strictly still, it indicates a particular way of living one's relationship with this transcendent reality, through specific beliefs, rituals, prayers, moral behaviors, and community participation (for example, Hindu, Buddhist, Jewish, Christian, Muslim, etc.). 1 There is of course no generic spirituality, untethered from a historical and particular tradition and community. Even when one attempts to construct one's own spirituality, one can only do so by drawing upon various elements of pre-existing spiritual traditions. In other words, the institutional dimension of spirituality is essential to any spiritual quest. 2 Needless to say, Asian spirituality embodies all these three connotations. It is human self-transcendence toward the Ultimate Other within a particular religious tradition. This is also true of Christian spirituality, which is a particular way of relating to God as Abba/Father, mediated by Jesus of Nazareth in his ministry, death, and resurrection, and made possible by the power of the Holy Spirit, who has been poured out upon the community called church. In short, Christian spirituality as relationship with God is pneumatological (empowered by the Spirit), Christological (mediated through and modeled after Christ), and ecclesial (realized in the church). This reflection on Asian Christian spirituality will consider how these three dimensions are realized in the context of Asian societies, cultures, and religions. On the basis of this context I will also delineate the contour of such a spirituality. 3 Spirituality as Life Empowered by the Spirit: Being Religious Interreligiously Spirituality is essentially life in the Spirit. It is not however antithetical to the body and matter. According to Paul, \"spirit\" (pneuma) and spiritual (pneumatikos)—from which \"spirituality\" is derived—are the opposites of \"flesh\" [End Page 221] (sarx), \"fleshly\" (sarkikos), and \"soul-ly\" (psychikos), but not of \"body\" (soma), \"bodily\" (somatikos), and \"matter\" (hyle). The Pauline opposition is not between two ontological orders: the incorporeal and the immaterial on the one hand and the corporeal and the material on the other. Such metaphysical dualism did not attach to the use of spiritualitas until the twelfth century. Rather, the opposition is between two ways of life, one that is led by and in accord with the Spirit (\"spiritual\") and therefore leading to life, and the other opposed to the Spirit (\"fleshly\") and bringing about death. Christian spirituality then is essentially life empowered by the Spirit of Christ, by which men and women are made sons and daughters of God by adoption and brothers and sisters of Christ into whose image they must be fashioned. Such a life is adorned with the Spirit's gift of virtues (1 Cor 13:13; Col 1:9; Rom 8:21; Gal 5:13; 2 Cor 3:17), fruits (Gal 5:23–24), and charisms of different kinds to build up the Christian community (1 Cor 12:4–11; 28–30; Rom 12:6–8; Eph 4:11–13). 4 Because Asia is the birthplace of most if not all religions, and because Christians form but a tiny minority of the Asian population, Asian Christians, more than their fellow-believers in any other part of the globe, cannot live their Spirit-empowered lives apart from non-Christian religions. At first, most missionaries, both Catholic and Protestant, were pessimistic about the spiritual values of these religious ways of life. But the goodness of non-Christians (many of them are holier than Christians!), with whom many Christians share their daily life intimately as family members, give the lie to the church's age-old teaching that...",

They are his symptom, jouissance and symbol. Fiction, the truth of the in/debted subject, an identity that is far from static, is unrecognized as long as he is trapped by narcissism. Interpreting what befalls us opens us up to the word, to love, as desire fails and distance sets in. Then and only then, for/giving, a new form of the first gift, a/rises unexpectedly, and the subject can find the style that preserves the promise which, alone, attracts. Does the Negative (excess, surprise, the other’s death, the Absent) set the cornerstone of an anthropology of giving? Trans/lating, or re/telling is Life. The Voice echoing in the temporality of history, calls the symptom, or the flesh of the subject, and it answers: “Here I am.”",

      "title": "Case Studies in Interdisciplinary Research",
      "abstract": "Humans are capable of understanding an incredible variety of actions performed by other humans. Even though these range from primary biological actions like eating and fleeing, to acts in parliament or in poetry, humans generally can make sense of each other’s actions. Understanding other people’s action, called can transcend differences in race, gender, culture, age, and social and historical circumstances. Action understanding is the cognitive capability of making sense of another person’s action by integrating perceptual information about the behavior with knowledge about the immediate and socio-cultural contexts of the action and with one’s own experience. Since it is necessary to integrate multiple sources of information, it is not surprising that failures to understand a person’s behavior are also common. Well known is the case of an autistic professor who compares herself to an anthropologist from Mars. Incapable of spontaneously understanding why someone cries, she has learned rules that help her to infer that people who rub their eyes while tears are running down their cheeks are weeping and probably feel unhappy (Sacks, 1995). By contrast, normal individuals automatically allow stereotypes, prejudices, self-interests and the like to influence their understanding a person’s behavior (Bargh & Chartrand, 1999). More generally still, humans can easily misunderstand unfamiliar symbolic actions or rituals if they rely too much on their own socio-cultural expertise (Gadamer, 2004). Given the importance of action understanding in every domain of human life and society, and in light of the complexities that surround it, a comprehensive scientific understanding of this capacity is needed. Apart from satisfying intellectual curiosity, such insight would serve to improve our action understanding and mitigate several forms of misunderstanding. Indeed, in studying action understanding, we as scientists are engaged in the very process that is central to our concerns (Gergen & Semin, 1990, p. 1). Scholars are increasingly dissatisfied with mono-disciplinary approaches to understanding human action. Such one-sidedness can rest upon various motives. For example, hermeneutic interpretations of action understanding tend to emphasize historical and cultural influences while overlooking that ultimately such influences depend upon individual cognitive processes.1 This has led to a critique of the assumption that humans are born as a blank slate and that culture is solely responsible for all cognitive contents. However, such critique easily slides into an overemphasis on the biology of human nature and a denial of socio-cultural influences on cognition (Pinker, 2003). Fortunately, recent interdisciplinary endeavors have shown that an interdisciplinary approach is preferable when investigating complex functions like action understanding. Such research often involves developing a new interdiscipline such as cultural psychology (Bruner, 1990) or combining insights from the social sciences and psychology (Shore, 1996; Sperber, 1996). Evidence shows that throughout human evolution there have been mutual influences between biological and cognitive processes that shape human capacities and socio-cultural influences on those processes (Bogdan, 2003; Donald, 1991; Tomasello, 1999). In addition to these interdisciplinary investigations, computational sciences and artificial intelligence research are developing computer models of human understanding that allow new types of experiments and simulations (Churchland, 1995). Such insights underscore the necessity and fruitfulness of disciplinary boundary crossing and require that various disciplinary methods, concepts and theories be combined in innovative ways.",

Akan tetapi Zuhud adalah suatu sikap mental yang mencerminkan pola hidup sederhana, tidak mementingkan kehidupan dunia secara berlebih-lebihan, namun tidak melupakannya sama sekali. Dunia bukanlah tujuan,te tapi tempat persinggahan dan tempat mengabdikan diri kepada Allah Swt. Zuhud tidak menolak, apalagi mengharamkan kekayaan. Zuhud hanya membenci kemewahan dan kehidupan dunia yang berlebih-lebihan. Seseorang boleh saja memiliki kekayaan yang melimpah, tetapi pola hidupnya tetap sederhana dan kekayaannya tersebut dipergunakan pada hal-hal yang dapat membuat dirinya lebih dicintai oleh Allah Swt dan lebih disenangi oleh orang lain. Sikap zuhud dan pola hidup sederhana telah dicontohkan oleh Rasulullah Saw dan para sahabatnya. Beliau dapat saja memiliki kekayaan, namun tidak dilakukannya. Selain itu, sikap zuhud akan melahirkan sifat-sifat terpuji, seperti qana'ah, tawadhu' dan syukur. Sifat-sifat ini dapat melahirkan ketenangan dalam kehidupan.

      "abstract": "At the beginning of the Nicomachean Ethics, Aristotle claims that all arts and inquiries, acts and choices, aim at some good. Indeed, they presume an ultimate good. For if they sought no good at all they would not be chosen, and without an ultimate intrinsic good their rationality would collapse. Aristotle's title for that ultimate aim, a title meant to be uncontroversial, is eudaimonia, loosely translatable as happiness. Its nature is not a given: philosophy has its work cut out for it in clarifying just what this ultimate human goal must be. Some seek happiness in pleasure, wealth, or honor; others scramble for whatever sensation appeals at the moment or blindly pursue domination. Aristotle, however, maintains that (1) eudaimonia is something objective, not mere gratification, euphoria, or complacency; (2) it is not merely a passive state of well-being but an active life of doing well (euprattein); and (3) the virtues are dispositions that promote the good life that we seek. Aristotelian moral virtues such as courage, generosity, and self-control are dispositions, or habits of acting in accordance with a mean discerned by reason. Phronesis, strength in deliberation, is an intellectual virtue, but sophia, the queen of the intellectual virtues, finds our most godlike activity in contemplation. As Aristotle sees it, the virtues point the way to happiness, much as Plato sought the nature of reality through his conception of knowledge.",

Repentance is relevant to personal identity because the unrepentant soul has his own theory of personal identity. The unrepentant person believes he is his preference , and that he is entitled to the behavior that flows from those preferences. This fact can explain why people are so often reluctant to admit wrongdoing, why people place so much importance upon receiving an apology and other behaviors that would be otherwise inexplicable. The unrepentant person uses something akin to a naive economic theory of human behavior. The naive version of homo economicus , or economic man, can never truly be sorry for anything, and as a result, will be almost impossible to live with.

Even where investigators of primitive cultures conclude that some community is at such a low level of development that it has elaborated no ideas concerning the existence of gods, demons, spirits, and so forth—even there, a cautious attitude toward such evidence is necessary. Actually, the conviction that \"savages\" do not have such beliefs may be less a reflection of the real state of affairs than, let us say, the reluctance of members of that community to familiarize Europeans with elements of their culture that bear on spheres of life activity that are most meaningful for the tribe. Thus the anthropologist W.R. Trevathan1 mentions particular difficulties arising from attempts to study the actions and rituals associated with the birth of a child (as well as the stages directly preceding and following this event). Even where there is a friendly attitude toward the investigator, there still remain spheres of life to which representatives of the tribe were reluctant to allow Europeans access. For example, there is the well-known case where one anthropologist, who had lost hope of \"officially\" learning about the character of the rituals accompanying the birth of an infant, attempted to sneak a look at what was happening in the hut. This curiosity almost cost him his life, despite the recent goodwill of his host.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Having the emotion of pride requires taking oneself to stand in some special relation to the object of pride. According to agency accounts of this pride relation, the self and the object of pride are suitably related just in case one is morally responsible for the existence or excellence of the object of one's pride. I argue that agency accounts fail. This argument provides a strong prima facie defence of an alternate account of pride, according to which the self and the object of pride are suitably related just in case one's relation to the object of pride indicates that one's life accords with some of one's personal ideals. I conclude that the pride relation, though distinct from the relation of moral responsibility, is nonetheless a relation of philosophical interest that merits further attention. … the objects which excite these passions [pride and humility], are very numerous, and seemingly very different from each other. Pride or self‐esteem may arise from the qualities of the mind; wit, good‐sense, learning, courage, integrity: from those of the body; beauty, strength, agility, good mien, address in dancing, riding, fencing: from external advantages; country, family, children, relations, riches, houses, gardens, horses, dogs, cloaths. [I] afterwards proceed to find out that common circumstance, in which all these objects agree, and which causes them to operate on the passions. —David Hume",

Empirical scientists tell us that what we call “thinking for ourselves” is really just another causally determined process in nature; skeptics tell us that we have no reason to think that thought of this kind can give us access to reality; post-modernists tell us that the subject or the self, itself, is an illusion; defenders of “traditional values” tell us that there is nothing to deter a subject or a self that sets its authority above that of tradition from disregarding the rights and interests of others; and religious thinkers tell us that insistence on one's own freedom and independence may prevent one from experiencing the affiliation with reality as a whole, and the resulting meaning, value, and identity, that can be found through a relationship with God.

What I know about the contents of my own mind I generally know without investigation or appeal to evidence. There are exceptions, but the primacy of unmediated self-knowledge is attested by the fact that we distrust the exceptions until they can be reconciled with the unmediated. My knowledge of the world outside of myself, on the other hand, depends on the functioning of my sense organs, and this causal dependence on the senses makes my beliefs about the world of nature open to a sort of uncertainty that arises only rarely in the case of beliefs about my own states of mind. Many of my simple perceptions of what is going on in the world are not based on further evidence; my perceptual beliefs are simply caused directly by the events and objects around me. But my knowledge of the propositional contents of other minds is never immediate in this sense; I would have no access to what others think and value if I could not note their behaviour.",

      "abstract": "It may be asked: How did the peasant bear all this? We must not forget that, under the simpler and rougher conditions then prevailing everywhere, men did not feel the contrasts as they would be felt in our own day. Again, the medieval labourer did in some ways grapple more directly with nature, and at his actual work (as apart from his leisure) was less tempted to look upon himself as a mere cogwheel than the modern operative. This, however, is often exaggerated beyond all reason by modern writers; and, even so far as it is true, we must counterbalance it by the consideration that the modern wage-earner, when not at work, has the run of a far wider world, both physically and intellectually, that was closed to his forefathers. The sociologist Durkheim has pointed out that, in spite of many things which still remain to be remedied in the modern worker's lot, he has more originality of mind than the noble savage. If we take a hundred of these latter at random, we shall find great uniformity of taste; what one likes, all like, what one dislikes, all dislike. A hundred operatives, on the other hand, liberated from their eight hours of mechanical drudgery in the workshop, scatter to a multitude of various occupations until the work hours come again. At any rate, we have the plainest evidence that the medieval peasant was not content with his lot, quite apart from the bare fact of those bloody revolts which are recorded in almost all countries.",

      "abstract": "What is it to be ‘morally serious’? In one sense, it is quite obvious that a man who stands by his moral principles with difficulty and in face of many obstacles, even to the extent of giving his life rather than denying these principles, is a morally serious person. He might be contrasted with a man who gives up or modifies his moral principles whenever their implementation becomes difficult, or threatens to harm his interests; and this person might be called morally frivolous. That is what moral seriousness is; but still, one might ask, what is it to be a morally serious man? What does it involve to be such a man? Is it just a sort of pathological obstinacy; even, perhaps, a misplaced conservatism in face of the facts, which clings to the principles it knows, whatever the cost? One cannot rule out such a possibility. But the martyr and the hero do not consider themselves to be merely obstinate. In the face of risk and even certain suffering, they typically regard it as of supreme importance to be obstinate in sustaining their principles. Something more is felt to be at stake than mere defence of the status quo.",

The WHO definition of Health, adopted in 1948 and since then never amended, has become obsolete: “Health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.” A new, more positive definition ought to replace the obsolete. “The ability to adapt and self-manage physical, mental and social well-being challenges.” Different approach WHO. Health care is to be claimed unlimitedly, making sure you get better, free from symptoms, against any price, something you undergo and releases you from the responsibility to self-manage and recover. YES WE CAN. Care appealing to personal strength and possibilities. Care that also demands commitment, not a lack thereof. Care that apart from physical/mental functioning also deals with a spiritual dimension within a personal context. Care that deals with purpose (life goals) for both the patient and the caretaker. Conclusion Yes We Can and Positive Health has been very successful: – perfect climate for recovery: e.g. role models, positive group dynamics, expert experience, no coercion or compulsion, structured healthy program; – focus on strength hand abilities, coping skills, learn what is important, moral, values; – system oriented: family therapy is mandatory; – after-care (helping back to school/work); – be Aware: old fellows help with prevention by visiting various schools.

      "abstract": "It is commonly supposed that relations (of appropriation, domination, liberation...) come after the constitution of its terms - subjects, objects, groups. The theory of '˜individuation’ proposed by Gilbert Simondon avoids such substantialism. It does not consider individuals as given but rather as dynamic co-constructions permanently related to different ways of being, rythms and gestures, while the environments in which they act are not so much contexts as sets of dissonances which are as many reserves of becoming. Thus the possibilities of emancipation of both individuals and collectives can be recast : in the tension between individual and collective moments, a space opens for a relation to oneself in which the individual extracts himself from the already constituted, transcends his limits, re-elaborates a way of being, and reinvents the forms of his participation in the world.",

Siddharta’s thinking is expressed by the monologues or the dialogues in the concrete contexts to which Siddharta belongs. Even though the themes and theses of his thoughts are philosophical, they neither make arguments, nor theories but are merely scattered and fragmentary remarks on the various states of affairs encountered during human life. His remarks constitute a working notebook or albums full of trials, errors, revisions, and sketches made in the course of journey called life. There is no such thing as nirvana according to Siddharta. There is only a continuous rebirth of life. Achieving nirvana is not the aim of Siddharta. In the course of a continuous rebirth of life, the past does not remain as traces or shadows in the present. Rather, as it is exhausted or knotted by deconstruction, overcoming, or oblivion, the past prepares a new departure. The rupture and the discontinuity that a new departure entails are balanced in the text by the macro plot of return. The life of Siddharta proceeds with the dual flow of difference and repetition. The touching ending of Siddharta is to be understood neither as the final conclusion of his inquiry nor as his attaining of eternal truth or nirvana. It merely represents the tentative path mark that is reached by a finite being, i.e., Siddharta. After the text of Siddharta is over, the life of Siddharta will continue. Even though there may be no more awakening, he will devote himself to the keeping and practicing of what he has learnt.",

      "abstract": "English shame and German scham derive from the Gothic schama , ‘to hide, cover, conceal’. German Hemd (shirt) and English and French chemise are other derivatives. In some languages the word for ‘shame’ and the word for ‘wound’ are the same. A wound exposes and can thereby advertise vulnerabilty and a cause for shame. Hiding or covering may seek to guard against wounding, humiliating exposure. Shame is self-evidently an important human emotion. Insofar as animals are innocent of shame, experience of it is a mark of humanity. Much human behaviour is influenced by fear of shame and embarrassment. Living in the face and eyes, shame is very close to the experienced self. Self-image and self-esteem are heavily determined by one's susceptibility to shame. Experience of shame is impossible without a sense of individuation, without a sense of discreteness from the world and of being an object in the eyes of another. Study of shame sensitivity therefore offers many clues to an individual's or a culture's behaviour, sense of identity and relationship to the environment.",

Post-qualitative research poses radical questions about this 'hierarchy of agencies' and foregrounds notions such as 'distributed agency' or 'mutual performativity'. Quantum field theory suggests that beings are indeterminate and extend ontologically across different spaces and times. So, it is impossible to say that this has, or has not got, agency – only as a (non-causal) part of a phenomenon that performs. Agency shifts to human-non-human collectives that never stand still. Nonhuman things and forces (e.g., atmosphere, food, affect) actively shape and constrain the bodies they encounter, including the humans who never fully possess or control them. The post-qualitative shift invites a different art of noticing, of becoming affected and of sensing socio-material connections and different times and temporalities, rather than focusing on individual bodies, whether human or nonhuman.",

It is the hau of the gift that obliges the recipient to reciprocate it. The Shorter Oxford Dictionary defines heirloom as a chattel which under a will or by custom is inherited by an heir in the same way as real estate. When people do not receive in inheritance the gifts they had counted on or hoped for, reactions vary; they may consider it an upsetting omission, an offensive insult, an administrative error, or simply something to be forgotten quickly. According to Bourdieu, the gift receives its meaning from the response it produces. Gifts may also misfire.",

If one considers the shadow as a metaphor of the double, of plurality, one is led on one hand to a more complex order and on the other hand, to a communal conception of life. Since everything has its place in social reality, everyone can live there.

In spite of this - or because of it - play constitutes an essential element of human social and spiritual development.In this classic study, Caillois defines play as a free and voluntary activity that occurs in a pure space, isolated and protected from the rest of life. Play is uncertain, since the outcome may not be foreseen, and it is governed by rules that provide a level playing field for all participants. In its most basic form, play consists of finding a response to the opponent's action - or to the play situation - that is free within the limits set by the rules.Caillois qualifies types of games - according to whether competition, chance, simulation, or vertigo (being physically out of control) is dominant - and ways of playing, ranging from the unrestricted improvisation characteristic of children's play to the disciplined pursuit of solutions to gratuitously difficult puzzles. Caillois also examines the means by which games become part of daily life and ultimately contribute to various cultures their most characteristic customs and institutions. Presented here in Meyer Barash's superb English translation, Man, Play and Games is a companion volume to Caillois's Man and the Sacred.",

The first one is that life comes from God and is his gift, his image, his mark. God is the only owner of life; therefore this is an unthinkable reality, which is removed from the power of any man. Traditional analyses of death and dying acknowledge, at least implicitly, that decisions about health care take place in the context of relationships, social interdependence, and social obligations. However, bioethics through the middle of the twentieth century still concentrated attention on individual decisions and guarantees of autonomy. Christian teaching has traditionally opposed active causation of death, even for suffering, terminally ill patients. At the same time, death need not be opposed absolutely. The death of a very elderly or ill person may be accepted as appropriate, and measures to prolong life may be refused. To determine the moral character of decisions to use or refuse means, the context must be examined. For one thing, a means that is virtually useless or very dangerous in one era of medical practice may improve in efficacy as time goes on. Similarly, what is not tolerable or effective for one patient may be reasonable and useful for another. Moreover, the patient considering the acceptance of death must sometimes take into account the common good, for which he or she may still have a responsibility.",

      "abstract": "Abstract David Hume has argued that the contents of people's minds depend wholly on experience, and that through experience, they gain no insight into the natures or essences or powers of objects. They are able to function effectively in the world only because they are creatures of habit: they are so geared that, without understanding why things occur as they do, they just expect the world to go on in the way that it has. Human beings are crude inductivists, and cannot but be so. However, people are not hopelessly crude, because their expectations are themselves capable of nuance: the more or less frequently something has occurred, the more or less confidently they expect it. Where experience has been entirely uniform, expectations are unshakeable.",

      "title": "Agency, mental illness, and psychiatry: A response to Thomas Szasz",
      "abstract": "Szasz’s understanding of persons as agents underwrites his ideas about mental illness and clinical psychiatry as a medical specialty. He asserts that the phenomena of mental illnesses, including suffering, signal “problems in living” or difficulties in determining the best use of one’s agential powers. The goals of the relationship are to enhance the client’s knowledge of his or her personality, to refine his intentions and sense of responsibility for his “symptoms” and other actions, and to achieve his aims and satisfy his desires, as long as he does not, by his actions, harm others. For the author of this chapter and other clinicians, the experience of phenomena exhibited by persons judged to be mentally ill are, to some extent and sense, apprehended as events that happen, rather than as actions authored by the person as agent. These untoward activities suggest a undesirable organismic condition of a person as agent, a diminution of the agent’s capacity for living a life, the signal of a organismic disorder, a problem with the human organismic equipment for living a life—not solely a problem about the best use of that equipment (as Szasz contends) but a state of ill health and a suffering person in need of treatment.",

This requires that we have both a physical and a moral faculty to produce the thing or action, that is, that it not be beyond our strength to produce it and that we not be prohibited from accomplishing it by some law. For when something has been placed within my strength and I am left with the faculty to make a decision about it, nothing at all prevents me from voluntarily laying upon myself the necessity of furnishing it to another, when it would have a use for human life. On the other hand, it is pointless to contract an obligation with respect to things that either exceed our strength or cannot be done without violating a stronger obligation, since it would lack any direct and legitimate effect.",

      "abstract": "Fear and anxiety are common in dogs. Separation related disorders, fear-related aggression, and noise phobia are some of the most common problem-related behaviours in dogs. Fear and anxiety cause stress which could lead to chronic stress. Dogs that suffer from fear-related problems are often euthanized or abandoned. Dogs with fear-related aggression could be potentially dangerous to humans since the fear triggers an aggressive response which might cause the dog to bite. Fear is an adaptive response that increases the survival of a species and results in a physical and physiological response that prepares the individual for fight or flight. However, when this behaviour is generalised and/or triggered too easily and/or is expressed intensively, it usually becomes problematic for the dog, humans and society.\r\nFear-related aggression occurs when the dog encounters a problem stimulus which it cannot avoid. Fear-related aggression is often misinterpreted as protective aggression, e.g. that the dog wants to protect its owner. In reality, the dog is frightened and wants to defend itself from danger. Dogs could show signs of fear-related aggression by snarling, snapping or biting.\r\nDogs with noise phobia are commonly afraid of thunder, fireworks and/or gunshots. Fear of noises and thunderstorms tend to escalate, i.e. worsening with each exposure. A dog with a fear of gunshots might eventually become fearful of similar sounds or events associated with the noise (generalised fear). Panting, shaking or flight attempts could be signs of noise phobia.\r\nSeparation-related behaviour occurs when the dog is separated from the owner. It could be caused by a lack of habituation to being alone. Destructive behaviour, vocalisation or hyperactivity are some signs of separation-related disorders.\r\nBehaviour therapy, changes in the environment and medication are common methods for treatment of fear-related aggression, noise phobia and separation-related disorders, the effects of these treatments are discussed.",

Historians have long been interested in agency, questioning the extent to which certain people at certain times—enslaved people, women, other minorities for example—have been able to act rather than simply be acted upon. Design historians, historians of material culture and museum curators have long considered the power of objects to influence our lived experience. This book goes one step further, drawing attention to the ways in which designed objects can be understood to have agency through their power to both facilitate and constitute identities. Designed objects imply an intended use, an imagined performance, and thus to pay attention to them is to consider who is afforded agency through design, and who might not be. The ‘tricky’ and ‘slippery’ nature of agency is acknowledged in the introduction: ‘Agency is not monolithic, unidimensional, or unidirectional…Agency is not equally experienced or expressed precisely because it...",

On the other hand, caught up in the whirlwind of different life choices to find professional fulfillment, he may not find his desires fulfilled and not feel the joy of earthly life, thus falling prey to fears, fears, unhappiness, and neurotic-depressive behavior, amplified in recent years by the various global crises (the COVID-19 pandemic, the war in the Soviet space etc.).",

      "abstract": "Marie-Benoît Bernard, O.C.S.O. 216 THE SACRED ART OF LOVE Marie-Benoît Bernard, O.C.S.O. \"Yes, it is good, it is sweet for brothers [and sisters] to live together and to be united\" (Ps 133). \"Then he returned to the place of his beloved solitude, and alone, under the eye of the Onlooker from above, he dwelt with himself.\" (Gregory the Great, Dial. II.III.5).1 INTRODUCTION RB 52 focuses on the oratory,2 the particular place in the monastery where we come to pray the psalms with our brothers or sisters in choir at specific times each day and, at other times, to engage in personal prayer, experiencing a \"heart-to-heart\" or intimate solitude with God. In this chapter Saint Benedict is not content to simply describe the oratory, enumerate more practices or customs (a list of \"tools of good works\" [RB 4]), prescribe actions and gestures, or influence inner disposition. Rather, with much simplicity and in very few words, as if creating a space of silence and freedom between each recommendation, he teaches an \"art of living together\" in the oratory, the sacred living space par excellence. This art engages the freedom of each of us in vibrant, peaceful and ardent prayer of the heart (in common and in solitude) to develop an authentic and profound relationship with God. This experience leads to God establishing his dwelling in us which establishes us in him and in his peace. In this sense, prayer according to Saint Benedict also appears to be a sort of \"sacred art of love.\" More particularly it is the art of exercising freedom, an art by which the Holy Spirit acts, works, and constructs a peace in the depth of our hearts that is the guardian of unity and sentinel and awakener of fraternal communion: Marie-Benoît Bernard, O.C.S.O. is a nun of Abbaye Sainte Marie du Rivet, Auros, France. This article first appeared in Collectanea Cisterciensia 72 (2010), 28–39. It is translated by Colleen Maura McGrane, O.S.B., Benedictine Sisters of Perpetual Adoration, Clyde, MO. 1 Gregory the Great and Adalbert de Vogüé, The Life of St. Benedict (Petersham, MA: St. Bede's, 1993). 2 Translators note: Throughout this article the word \"oratory\" will be used to designate the sacred space where monks and sisters gather to pray. Some communities may refer to this space as the \"chapel\" or \"church.\" 217 ABR 71:2 – JUNE 2020 The oratory must be what its name says: a place of prayer. Nothing else must be done in this place except prayer and only what is useful for prayer should be kept there. When the service of God is concluded, all should leave in a profound silence, with great reverence for God. Thus, when one brother wishes to remain to pray alone, the others must not disturb him. And when, at another time, a monk wishes to pray in the secret of his heart, he should simply enter and pray. He should not pray in a loud voice but wholeheartedly with tears. The monk who does not pray in this manner will not be permitted to remain in the oratory after the service of God, as we have said. Thus, he will not disturb another brother (RB 52).3 THE TEACHING OF SAINT BENEDICT ON PRAYER Woven into the description of the oratory, the teaching of Saint Benedict on prayer gets to the heart of the matter. It highlights the defining traits of monastic prayer, which are nothing other than reflections of the duties of monastic life, of profession and the vow of obedience. Prayer implies a conversion of heart and life. It is a grace of profound listening, attentiveness to others and to the presence of God.4 It is a state of mind and a stance of vigilance, the sign of the awakening of life itself. Those who pray are none other than the blessed sentinels who draw their inner lives as close as possible to the God who lives in the depths of their hearts. That is why Saint Benedict references certain qualities5 that monks must possess, just as the...",

Several examples of play or games are considered here to explain how people manage their relationships with words, objects and beings.

In the second, objects are used to symbolize and materialize rules, as during eating contests where the competitors are not permitted to drink more than a glass of water. Finally, confrontation with real or virtual opponents (in online games) is a good way to identify theories of mind, because players attribute agency to virtual beings.",

      "abstract": "The study of gratitude has expanded beyond interpersonal gratitude and considers how people respond to gifts that are not caused by human agency. Given the discord between the prominent understanding of gratitude requiring the appropriate recognition of a gift to a giver and the increasing divergence of transcendent belief systems that do not acknowledge a transcendent or cosmic giver, we explored how people with different worldviews viewed and experienced gratitude. Transcendence does not hinge on metaphysical beliefs, but it can be experienced phenomenologically and subjectively. We conducted a case-study narrative analysis (N = 6) that represents participants from three different categories of belief systems: theistic, non-theistic but spiritual, and other. Our findings demonstrate how people link their transcendent narrative identity to their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors pertaining to gratitude. Although the theistic participants thanked God for gifts, others who experienced transcendence without a clear referent or source described responding to gratitude by sharing goodness forward. These narratives suggest that the recognition and appreciation of a gift stemming from beyond human cause may be enough to generate transcendent emotions and values that prompt beyond-the-self behaviors.",

What is the relationship between such actions and our capacities for rational agency? I take this to be a question about responsibility in a particular use of that term, which I shall call ‘responsibility 2 ’. We are not responsible 2 for all our intentional actions (actions under hypnosis, for example), but we can nevertheless be responsible 2 for actions we do not adequately control, for negligent actions, and for non‐intentional omissions. Appreciating this helps show that familiar principles of responsibility are false: those which delimit responsibility to intentional actions or to actions and outcomes under our control. In the attempt to fashion an alternative principle, cases of negligence prove pivotal. We hold ourselves and others responsible 2 for conduct within our respective ‘domains of secure competence’, (i.e. that within which we are confident of doing what we set ourselves to do, barring events which defeat our competence), even when actions within that domain fail. The significance of this practice of holding ourselves and others responsible 2 lies in the way it maintains our sense of who we are and of how we are related to the world in which we act. 1",

      "title": "Does God Have a Nature? by Alvin Plantinga",
      "abstract": "616 BOOK REVIEWS Does God Have a Nature? (The Aquinas Lecture: 1980.) By ALVIN'j PL.ANTING.A. Milwaukee: Marquette University Press, 1980. Pp. ii + 146. Among the divine attributes important for Christians and other theists is God's aseity, which Alvin Plantinga in this excellently crafted book initially glosses as God's \" uncreatedness, self-sufficiency and independence of everything else\" (p. 1); \"all things depend on him, and he depends upon nothing at all\" (p. 2). But the existence of abstract objects, according to Plantinga, poses problems for belief in God's aseity. \" [P]roperties, propositions, numbers and states of affairs [for instance] ... are objects whose non-existence is quite impossible\" (p. 4). God cannot be said to create them, since they are beginningless; and since their non-existenec is impossible, they do not seem to depend on God in any other way either. But if such objects are parts of the world which God just has to accept, their existence appears to impugn God's aseity. The problem is made more acute by considering God himself. If God has a nature, that is, if he has some properties essentially, then it is not within his control whether or not he has those properties. \"So God's having a nature seems incompatible with his being in total control\" (p. 8). In the history of philosophical theology, nominalism, possibilism, and the doctrine of divine simplicity have been presented as solutions to this problem. Nominalism attempts to solve the problem by denying the existence of abstract objects such as properties and propositions. Plantinga argues that there are a number of difficulties with nominalism as a solution (one of them, he says-p. 85-is its obvious falsity), but chief among them is the fact that nominalism is simply irrelevant to this problem, which remains even if we pare our ontology down to concrete objects only. On Plantinga's interpretation of it, the doctrine of God's aseity is the doctrine that all things, including all truths, are up to God. Given that interpretation, the p11oblem with God's aseity is not really addressed by nominalism. Although nominalism denies that properties, divine or otherwise , have independent existence, certain propositions about God's nature nonetheless remain necessarily true; and these truths are not within God's control. Therefore, even if nominalism were correct, there would still be truths about God's nature which are not up to God and which consequently impugn his aseity. Possibilism attempts to solve the problem by claiming that God has no nature; all truths, including truths about God himself, are up to God. Much of Plantinga's discussion of possibilism is occupied with the question of whether Descartes was a possibilist. Plantinga concludes that he was and that he held a somewhat confused version of possibilism, an in- BOOK REVIEWS 617 consistent mixture of \" limited possibilism\" (the view that some truths are necessary though God could have made them otherwise) and \"universal possibilism \" (the view that there are no necessary truths, only contingent ones). Plantinga argues that contrary to appearances universal possibilism is a coherent position. And he maintains that, of the traditional solutions to the problem of God's ascity, universal possibilism is the only one really relevant to the problem because it alone puts everything , including all truths, within God's control. As for the doctrine of divine simplicity, on Plantinga's view, it is like nominalism in that both positions, besides their other flaws, have the overriding failing of irrelevance to the problem since according to each of these putative solutions some truths are not up to God. The strategy of Plantinga's own solution to the problem is the mirror image of that of nominalism. Nominalism attempts to resolve the apparent incompatibility of abstract objects and God's aseity by denying the existence of abstract objects. Plantinga attempts to resolve it by denying God's aseity. At the beginning of his last chapter he asks his \"final question\": \"should we follow Descartes in giving full sway to the sovereignty -aseity intuition, thus denying that God has a nature'\" (p. 126); and his answer is 'No'. He concludes by maintaining that God does have a...",

For all animals some basic communication is possible by means of visual and auditory signals; what distinguishes humans from other animals is the use of a language for communication. The ability to use a language in its spoken and written form is essential for anyone seeking an effective role in society. The necessary language skills are acquired without too much difficulty, and often taken for granted, by the majority of people. However, for a minority there is some handicap which makes communication through language very difficult or in some cases impossible.

There are little green men who walk around with toast and jam on their heads six days of the week (on Sundays they wear crumpets and honey). There are swans that smoke cigars and monkeys that fly. Such entities are not of our own manufacture: they are real and exist independently of us. And such entities are not mere abstractions: they are concrete entities with a precise spatiotemporal location. What is truly unfortunate, however, is that we shall never become acquainted with these strange and exotic creatures. Why? They exist in a parallel universe – other worlds – spatially, temporally and causally discontinuous with ours.",

      "abstract": "§ I. PURPOSE or THis PAPER.-It has been seen in another place how the relation of principal and agent may be created and how it may be terminated.The purpose of creating the agency is to confer authority upon the agent,--to clothe him to a greater or less extent, and for a shorter or longer period, with a portion of that power with which nature and the laws of society have invested the principal.For the time being, and in some capacity, the principal has another self, who, by his will and act, is invested with the power to speak and do with like effect as if he himself should speak or do.It will be very evident that to those persons who may have occasion to deal with the principal through this other self, the question of how fully, how certainly and for how long a time, he has invested the latter with his own personality, becomes exceedingly important.And not only this, but these matters being ascertained, it is no less important to determine whether any given act assumed to be done by virtue thereof, is, in reality, within the fullness, the certainty and the term of the investment.It will be equally evident that these are questions not always easy of solution, not only because men are notoriously careless and indefinite in their words and acts, but because even if, in a given case, a power has been conferred in terms the most express and definite, the questions may still arise whether the express words embrace the act assumed to be done by virtue of 'them; whether the mode of doing has been that contemplated by the language used; whether subsequent changes in the circumstances of the parties, or the condition of the subject matter have warranted any departure from that mode; whether in consideration of the nature of the act to be done, or the time and place of doing it, custom or necessity have added to, or subtracted from, the powers originally conferred.It is the purpose of this paper to ascertain the principles upon which the solution of these questions rests.§ 2. ScoPe oF rE QuEsTIoNs INvoLv.-It will be evident, also, upon reflection, that these questions can not well be considered in the abstract.It may indeed seem at first thought that the authority of an agent will always be a fixed and definite quantity, and that there must be certain rules which may invariably be applied to determine its existence and to measure its scope and extent.Further",

      "title": "[The comparison of human reflex and instinct behaviour (author's transl)].",
      "abstract": "On the basis of characteristics of the exteroceptive reflexes and of the instincts it was shown that instinct behaviour developed from reflex characteristics (local characteristic of the stimuli, pos. and neg. taxis, habituation, conditioning). Most similarities are found between reflex and avoidance instinct behaviour (instincts for excretion, thermoregulation, body care, pain avoidance and safety). Except the safety instinct, all others react on stimuli, characterised by the localisation of the receptors. In the safety instinct the structure of the stimulus becomes important, together with the growing importance of the third dimension. This instinct shows also for the first time a variability of the threshold with spontaneous remaining low for some time after stimulation of the system. Inverse the gain instincts (nutrition, sex and social instinct). Here the threshold falls spontaneously, when stimuli are lacking and raises, when stimuli are found. The spontaneous motor expression of the lowering of the threshold is the appetite behaviour. It means seeking stimuli, which will be gained by elements of the initial and terminal success behaviour. The successfull nutritional and sexual behaviour is stopped by success inhibition, whereas the social instinct remains in the terminal success behaviour with group dynamic hierarchy, with imitating and helping behaviour. Overchanging of the gain instincts provokes avoidance behaviour with constant threshold. The neural systems of most reflexes lie distributed in the spinal cord and brainstem, the ones of the instincts in the limbic part of the brain, the nutrition and sex instinct with a hypothalamic pacemaker. Simultaneous activation of two or many instinct motivation systems result, not comparable with the direct reflex interaction, in interactions on the level of the global interaction, in interactions on the level of the global integration (summation, mixture, synthesis, rest, oscillation, intention) which projects the activity patterns via the motor cortex to the peripheral neurons. There it is completed by the reflexes. The hormonal and vegetative projection instead go directly to the end organs. The motivation is responsible for the subjective experience, the dominating integration with its motor projection for the instinct behaviour.",

During moral panics, audiences are sensitized to any and all harms that stipulated deviants or folk devils might cause, and seize upon even flimsy evidence to support the claims. Fear or concern need not grip the entire society to qualify as a moral panic.

      "title": "Dehumanization and mental health",
      "abstract": "Dehumanization is a fearsome word, calling to mind the gravest atrocities of the past and present. People seen as less than human have suffered and suffer violence, deprivation, exclusion and dispossession, and that suffering has been and is routinely ignored or minimized. However, although dehumanization is usually understood as an extreme phenomenon confined to wars, genocides and conquests, it falls on a spectrum. Two decades of social psychological research have shown that it has significant repercussions in everyday life1. The burgeoning literature on dehumanization offers three key insights. First, dehumanization ranges from blatant and verbalized to subtle and unconscious: people can be explicitly likened to animals, but also implicitly denied fundamental human qualities such as rationality, self-control and complex emotions. Second, dehumanization takes varied forms, from seeing others as bestial or robotic, to rejecting their individuality or agency, to failing to spontaneously grant them minds. Third, although dehumanization often accompanies negative views of others, it is psychologically and even neurally distinct from prejudice. Seeing people as less than fully human is not the same as disliking them. We can dehumanize those about whom we are indifferent, not only those we hate. Indeed, studies of close relationships show that we can subtly dehumanize those we love. The vast literature on stigma reveals how people with mental illness are often viewed negatively by the general public, pictured as dangerous, blameworthy and shameful, with adverse implications for equity, well-being and recovery. It has recently become clear that, in addition to these negative perceptions, they are often also denied humanity. People are seen as less human when they receive mental rather than physical illness labels, and people with mental illnesses – especially schizophrenia and addictions – are even more blatantly dehumanized than some vilified ethnic or religious minorities2. Dehumanizing attitudes to the mentally ill are not confined to the public, but can also be held by mental health professionals. Researchers have begun to document the causes and consequences of these attitudes. One contributing factor is emotional self-preservation: professionals may dehumanize patients as a way to protect themselves against emotional exhaustion and distress3. The anticipation of emotional demands may motivate professionals to deny humanity to others and result in the withholding of empathy and care. Studies like these shine a new light on burnout, one of whose primary manifestations is the loss of empathy for others. In clinical settings, this dehumanization-like tendency may lead professionals to disengage from patients, failing to appreciate their emotional experience and reducing them to their diagnosis. Adverse working conditions that foster burnout, such as excessive workloads and organizations that treat employees as interchangeable cogs in an industrial machine, can lead mental health professionals to dehumanize patients, with the adverse effects on clinical care that burnout researchers have documented. One study found that psychiatric nurses who felt unsupported by their organizational superiors were more likely to experience burnout and depression as well as to dehumanize their patients (e.g., showing a greater willingness to bypass their consent)4. People who seek mental health treatment need not be denied humanity on the basis of their illness to suffer the impacts of dehumanization. Dehumanizing perceptions of racial minorities might contribute to racial disparities in mental health diagnosis and treatment, such as significantly elevated rates of chemical sedation in African American patients presenting to emergency departments with psychiatric disorders5, just as race-based dehumanization contributes to harsh discipline in criminal justice and educational settings. People who believe they are being denied humanity by others typically respond negatively. Just as believing that one is dehumanized based on one's race or political views has been shown to generate antagonistic reactions, so patients' engagement with psychiatric treatment may be undermined by experiences of dehumanization from demeaning media representations, dismissive interactions with professionals, and deindividuating encounters with the health care bureaucracy6. Dehumanizing perceptions can also be internalized rather than resisted. People who believe that others see them as less than human may come to \"self-dehumanize\". This phenomenon may have significant clinical implications. A study of patients with severe alcohol use disorders found that those who self-dehumanized more had lower self-esteem and engaged in less functional coping7. Research such as this indicates how dehumanization can create vicious cycles that compromise therapeutic aims. Being dehumanized can lead to feeling dehumanized, which can sabotage treatment. Being perceived as less than human may exacerbate an existing mental illness, but dehumanization might also be a risk factor for developing it. Indeed, studies point to adverse effects of dehumanization which are known psychiatric vulnerability factors. Being perceived as less than human increases people's feelings of social exclusion and also decreases others' willingness to help and show empathy1. The resulting social disconnection may amplify risk especially for internalizing and substance use disorders. In addition to reducing social connection, dehumanization increases tendencies to actively harm people and to tolerate harm perpetrated by others. People with stronger tendencies to dehumanize others are more likely to engage in bullying; men who dehumanize women are more prone to sexual violence and harassment; and people who dehumanize their opponents in ethnic conflicts are more likely to support violent actions towards them1. Exposure to violence is a significant psychiatric risk factor, and dehumanization fosters it. At a more systemic level, dehumanization based on race, social class, and immigrant status may reinforce the public acceptance of social disadvantage and economic hardship, known contributors to mental health inequities. The concept of dehumanization has proven to be a fruitful one for thinking about many forms of interpersonal and intergroup conflict. It complements more familiar constructs such as prejudice, stigma, stereotyping and discrimination by focusing on whether we perceive and treat others in ways that recognize our common humanity. Failures to do so have now been demonstrated in perceptions of diverse social groups, and their destructive implications are increasingly well understood. Research on dehumanization in the psychiatric realm is in its infancy, but strongly suggests that failures to fully humanize people with mental illness are widespread and have significant consequences. How dehumanization related to mental illness should be addressed is not a straightforward issue. At a population level, a cultural change is required for public perceptions of mental illness to become more humanizing. The promotion of dimensional models may lead people with mental illness to be seen as less drastically \"other\". Some aspects of dehumanizing media representations of mental illness have measurably declined in recent decades8. It is equally important to lessen dehumanization in clinical practice9. Dehumanization can be reduced by enhancing empathy in professionals, through selection and training, while recognizing that empathy and problem-solving can sometimes be in conflict, and by promoting face-to-face contact between professionals and patients despite the growing intrusion of medical technologies. Dehumanization can also be diminished by ensuring that patients and professionals are presented as individuals with uniquely identifying attributes, boosting patients' sense of agency by increasing their say over treatment, and attenuating the real and perceived dissimilarity between patients and professionals. The goal of humanizing care, within and beyond the mental health field, should be widely recognized and shared, and concrete strategies to address this goal should be identified and implemented. In addition to this, the impact of dehumanization on mental health at the population level should become a more explicit and specific focus of research.",

      "title": "Bored and spoiling for a flight: capabilities lost and found in lockdown",
      "abstract": "Human beings are dynamic; our innate faculties beg to engage in activities. To achieve fullness and human dignity, people “convert” personal capabilities into active “functionings,” Amartya Sen explains. This means that staying still is not a normal state. It can feel like punishment. Forced inactivity will generate resentment, resistance, and boredom that can fester until pent-up energy explodes violently, or implodes in depression. Boredom defaults on capabilities and resources in many cases. In other cases, stillness is a gift. It can stimulate the imagination to fill in emptiness with memories and new explorations. Either boredom builds toward doing damage, or it releases energy to think and to create. What people don't do is stay put, mentally or physically. Authorities-including police, judges, teachers, parents –should take this dynamic human condition into account and reconsider the effects of conventional command and control policies. Then they can choose between violence and creativity as alternative outlets for the energy that boredom generates. Short of facing up to human dynamism, decision-making may continue to favor strong-arm tactics, which trigger the violence and pain that policing is meant to mitigate. Is it surprising that apparently peaceful peoplebecome enraged in lockdown conditions? Do adults wonder why students drop-out of school and suffer escalating rates of depression and suicide? Boredom is certainly not the only cause for these disastrous effects, but to ignore it risks remaining complicit with processes that perpetuate personal and collective dysfunctions. Complicity with harmful practices will miss opportunities to channel frustrated energy toward developing human capabilities. Authorities are responsible for promoting peaceful development. We are all responsible.[2] Normally, people stay busy with routine activities. We work, play, attend to family and to friends. Particular activities have even become our public badges of identity, as is evident in surnames (Cooper, Baker, Taylor, Farmer, etc.) that trace back to work that ancestors answered to. Lockdown during COVID-19 meant that many otherwise occupied people had few outlets for energy. Those who knew how to meditate managed to assuage anxiety through contemplation and the pursuit of ideal emptiness.",

The inherent contradictions in this issue are put aside with people's insistence on their own, God-willed need to succeed. Three human conditions furnish examples for the aesthetics of this order: Beauty in nature is amoral, but for people, who are endowed with discernment, it is linked to ethics and morals and often is ambivalent and difficult to handle. Work is a necessary part of God's order, but its aesthetic value is routinely compromised: it is a burden, often painful, and only the rich and the dead can escape it. Time is the inescapable movement that structures everything and cannot easily be manipulated.

      "title": "Social Psychology and the Law",
      "abstract": "Virtually every aspect of legal rules and procedures relies on assumptions about human psychology — about how individuals think, feel, and make decisions. Economics focuses on how people behave and interact as economic agents; psychology also focuses on human behavior and interaction, with specific attention to the influence of social and mental processes. Sometimes the law implicitly or explicitly incorporates findings from psychological science. For example, the law of negligence accounts for some of the limitations of human judgment in hindsight (Rachlinski, 1998). Because the hindsight bias is part of folk wisdom, legal rules have responded accordingly, such as in patent law where non- obviousness is determined by reference to secondary considerations like commercial success to “guard against slipping into the use of hindsight” (Rachlinski, 1998). But sometimes folk wisdom misunderstands human behavior and decision- making processes. Thus, for example, most people deem it unthinkable that an innocent person would confess to a crime she did not commit, in the absence of physical torture. And when folk wisdom misses the mark, it is more likely that judges, legislators, and other legal actors will fail to account for what psychological science might tell us about the human behavior in question. As one pioneer of the field of law and psychology observed over a century ago, “[Jurists] go on thinking that their legal instinct and their common sense supplies them with all that is needed” (Münsterberg, 1908). This chapter examines some of the implicit psychological assumptions about human behavior embedded in legal rules and practices. We narrow our focus specifically to social psychology, which we define as the scientific study of the ways in which individuals’ thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are influenced by the real, implied, or imagined presence of others (Allport, 1924).",

      "abstract": "Stephen Darwall's understanding of what kind of life is a good life, good for the person whose life it is, belongs in the same family as, among others, Scanlon's and mine. It is a family of views about well-being which descends from Aristotle, and Darwall has much of interest to say about the good life, and particularly about Aristotle's views on the subject. Many of the observations central to his position seem to me cogent, and are shared by other writers. These include three important propositions: that a good life, one which is good for those whose life it is, is not necessarily the same as a life which they think is good for them, nor does it necessarily consist in their desires being satisfied, nor in the satisfaction of any subset of their desires (e.g. their considered desires, or those not based on any false assumptions). that people aim or intend to do what is worth doing, to have relationships worth having, and engage in goals worth pursuing, and so on, and that all of these, and their combination, are distinct from having a good life (and this explains how people can knowingly sacrifice their own good), and that what makes the well-being of people worth pursuing, to the extent that it is, what provides reasons for those same people and for others to protect or promote it, is that people are valuable in themselves.",

Consequentialists such as Kagan respond that friendship does not, in fact, require partiality. Against this, I argue that friendship cannot exist without expressions of personal feeling, and that such expressions necessarily involve a kind of partiality. Because her every action is determined by the goal of maximizing the impersonal good, a consequentialist cannot use her actions (including actions of speech) to express her feelings for her fellows. I argue that we should expect this problem to afflict sophisticated as well as straightforward consequentialism. Finally, I consider and reject the suggestion that the consequentialist agent, who has no particular friends, can be considered a friend to everybody.",

      "abstract": "In this paper, I examined Daryl Siedentopʼs thoughts on Physical Education by considering the influences of Existentialism and Behaviorism and comparing it with Donald Hellisonʼs huma nistic physical education. Siedentop aimed for autonomy and authenticity in physical education and suggested the existential nature where man has the choice to be by himself but, paradoxic ally, cannot exist without his fellow man. His concept of physical education, which aimed tenden cy (attitude) to play, was common with Humanistic physical education movement because they emphasized affective development like “self-actualization.” However, his thought was not consist ent with the movement due to the following 3 points; he believed (1) in selves that are modified and learned, and not a unitary self that should be realized or uncovered, (2) that the inner world is considerably influenced by the other (outer) world, so otherʼs evaluation of oneʼs physical perfo rmance is more important than what one thinks about oneʼs own physical ability, (3) not suppose something subjectivity that transcend the environment and heredity, so communication in play environment is more important than dialogue and uncovering himself. These differences make each physical education theory and curriculum. Hellison suggested developmental level and dialo gue methods. Siedentop suggested festivity experience with team affiliation. Siedentopʼs physical education has two meanings in terms of acquiring skill, both personally and for the group. How to include self-reflection of skills is the next problem for this theory.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The statement that we are currently failing to address some of humanity’s greatest challenges seems uncontroversial—we are not doing enough to limit global warming to a maximum of 2 °C and we are exposing vulnerable people to preventable diseases when failing to produce herd immunity. But what singles out such failings (inactions) from all the things we did not do (non-actions) when all are unintended? Unlike their individualist counterparts, collective inaction and omission have not yet received much attention in the literature. (Unintended) collective inaction, I argue, can be attributed to a group of agents where a collective action (or a collective outcome) x that the agents did not perform (or did not produce) was collectively feasible at time t where each agent in that group had sufficient reason to contribute to performing (or producing) x or others had a reasonable expectation that they would perform (or produce) x . I show that, perhaps surprisingly, we can speak of collective inaction even where only one member of the group fails to act. However, where large and dispersed groups of agents are concerned, there is often no meaningful way of attributing collective failings. Still, I contend that the failure to close the global emissions gap and—in some cases—to generate herd immunity are indeed on us .",

      "abstract": "Self-defense and its close relative, defense of others, are uses of force against another person — Attacker — for the purpose of preventing Attacker from harming another’s person or property. These uses of force are called self-defense (SD) when employed by the one whose person or property is threatened (the Victim, or V); they are called defense of others (DO) when employed by a non-threatened third party who is not in V’s family (TP).SD and DO are preemptive uses of force because they occur before the acts they are intended to prevent occur. They thus belong to the family of preemptive measures that harm people or restrict their liberty in order to prevent them from harming others in the future. Examples of preemptive measures other than SD and DO include preventive detention, restraining orders, gun control laws, and similar laws making possession of certain items illegal for fear of their misuse.Because SD and DO are preemptive, they operate in the realm of epistemic uncertainty. V and TP can never be certain the feared acts will occur. They can never be certain that if the acts occur, what their consequences will be. They can never be certain what alternative to SD and DO for averting the feared harms exist. And they can never be certain what the status of the presumed Attacker is — that is, whether the presumed Attacker is culpable or nonculpable. I will have had a lot more to say about these epistemic points in due course.",

      "abstract": "A definition of the terms High Deity and High God must first be given. They stand for a phenomenon which is widely met in many parts of Africa: besides the spirits and deities there is an isolated deity, quite independent from and not related to other deities, solitary and of unknown origin, without dependents, neither wife nor family. Certain general characteristics always recur. This High God is usually known as creator, but not necessarily in the sense of a creatio ex nihilo. He has set certain rules of human conduct. The phenomenon of death is often traced back to him, and it is he who calls away those whose time on earth is over. In the beginning he used to live near the places of men, but later-sometimes in consequence of some human awkwardness-he has withdrawn. He is very rarely the object of regular cult. At the most a brief ritual prayer is addressed to him at a fixed time of the day. His remoteness can be so great that he exists quite passively, having retired into himself. In this case we speak of a Deus otiosus, a God who exists in complete idleness. His ethical qualities vary. One cannot say that the High God is always malevolent; it would be more to the point to state that he has positive characteristics as well as negative ones. There are also thoroughly benevolent High Gods. When looking for a parallel in the history of religions, one might think of the deistic conception of God, a conception which-in the form of an undercurrent in official Christianity-is still widely spread in Europe. A High God of this kind is called 'Supreme Being' by some students of Comparative Religion. I for one do not use this term, as it is also used to define the highest deity of a Pantheon. 1) Nevertheless, occasional overlappings do occur: at times the High God is integrated into a Pantheon. In such a case, the High God apparently is only one member of the family of Gods.",

      "title": "Functional Clothing for The Differently Abled",
      "abstract": "Disability may be broadly defined as a physical or mental condition that limits a person's movements, senses, or activities. Functional clothing is essentially designed to fulfil special requirements of the wearer including body disproportions or impairment. It also may affect a person's emotional wellbeing. This is an exciting field of study where opportunities of research, design and development of clothing for differently persons are being explored all over the world. Research and development of functional clothing in India is a relatively new field. This paper traces outstanding global advances in the field of functional clothing for the differently abled. Disabilities are of many types and functional clothing for each type of disability has entirely different requirements. Persons who are wheelchair bound, those who are bed ridden, persons who are spastic, autistic etc. all require different kinds of functional clothing. Clothing should be aesthetically appealing and should follow current fashion trends wherever possible; they should be easy to wear by themselves; they should be easy to care for and also provide the wearers with a sense of physical and mental comfort. Special requirements which arise from disabilities require the application of design and development to address the physical, physiological and mental issues for the differently abled. Global standards in quality, aesthetics and convenience should be followed so that such persons do not feel uncomfortable in any way. The paper introduces readers to new and exciting developments in the field of functional clothing for the disabled.",

      "title": "Sampling in Ethnographic Fieldwork",
      "abstract": "An ethnographer cannot avoid selecting some people, objects, or events for study, thereby renouncing, for a time at least, the possibility of studying others. From a vast range of possibilities, he takes up work in a particular tribe, village, or town; questions certain respondents; employs a few informants; observes some artefacts, situations, or behavioural events, and makes observations at restricted times. If the word 'sampling' is used so broadly, then fieldworkers are constantly sampling the universe of people, situations, objects and behavioural events with which they are occupied. Seldom, however, do they keep track of how they drew a sample or report its composition. Even statements as general as my pseudonymous list of principal Kaska Indian informants and subjects,1 and Margaret Mead's 'neighbourhood maps',2 identifying the adolescent and pre-adolescent girls she observed, are rare. An anthropologist characteristically extends his remarks beyond his sample and talks about 'the' Kaska Indians and Samoan girls or about child rearing, quarrels and pottery techniques in general-as though he had studied the community, category, or topic exhaustively. The usual spoken implication is that for his problem, the sample adequately represented a larger universe of actors, topics, culture patterns, techniques, or other units under study and, therefore, could provide reliable information about that universe as it existed at a particular time. A statistically conscious observer might object and point out that for a sample to be considered in a strict sense representative of the universe whence it came, it must have been selected in a suitable manner. Anthropologists are likely to respond by protesting that it is not they who decide what persons or events to use as sources of data; such decisions are practically made for them when certain individuals volunteer their help, some groups extend welcome, and some techniques happen to be accessible to observation.3 That units force themselves on a researcher's attention, is merely a figure of speech. It overlooks the fieldworker's readiness to respond positively or negatively to certain cues in the field situation and ignores his active involvement in deciding how to respond to environmental opportunities or when to surrender to unbreachable limitations.",

By means of presence, actors can discover who they are at their cores and deliver a powerful message to the audience without any words.\r\nActor’s presence is available only if actor are aware of their living body. In other words, ‘Bodily-awareness’ is the decisive factor of actor’s presence. However, each actor has distinct habits which respond unconsciously and cannot be inhibited volitionally. Habits distort proprioception, the major source of bodily awareness.\r\nThere are four fundamental habits which inhibit actor's presence on stage. Namely, habitual concentration on time, space, oneself, and goals. To explain, actors have a tendency to focus on the past or the future rather than the present, and they are likely to pay attention to the audience or counterparts without being aware of their bodies and the whole space surrounding them. Furthermore, there is a big chance that actors have self-consciousness, which means comparing or evaluating themselves with the norms as opposed to bodily-awareness. Plus, actors tend to concentrate on extrinsic targets toward the audience, director, and character. These habits tenaciously make actors not mindful of their bodies.\r\nIf actors learn how they discover and inhibit their own habits, they can build their own methodologies that are able to train themselves as existent actors on stage. Alexander technique would be a powerful method to recover actor's body awareness, leading to actor's scenic presence.",

      "abstract": "Abstract By God we mean an absolute being, a being of infinite perfection. The synthesis that purges the idea of God of all projections of evil allows the goodness in all things to be understood in relation to God’s goodness. All reality, conceived as a value, and all truth, conceived as the adequacy of things to their projects, can then be seen as God’s work, expressing his will and idea. The idea of God readily conjures up folklore and mythic images, enriching, diluting, clarifying, or muddying its content. The core idea, I think, is not very far from what many myths and fables seek to convey. Thus the Midrash characteristically brackets its parables of God in an “as it were” (ke-ve-yakhol), focusing on a single point but barring implication to or from the contexts that familiar images might suggest—as if to say: “This sets no precedent.” When visions stray from the idea of perfection, however, it is the work of imagination that must yield. For absolute perfection is the sole coherent outcome of the dialectical and moral honing of the idea of divinity. This, then, is the concept that philosophers must address, much as Abraham dismissed all deities that proved to be the mere work of human hands or were subject to diminution. Religiously, our matter must be more than a narrative or natural history of human fears and wishes.",

The former have found it necessary to give greater attention to social and historical influences on the development of personality, while the latter are seeking a better understanding of irrational and unconscious influences on individual and group behavior in history.' On both sides the difficulties are formidable, most psychoanalysts knowing too little history and most historians too little psychoanalysis. Biographers have a special handicap: the subject is dead or, if alive, usually inaccessible to analysis. Material for analysis may be found in his writings, in his recorded speeches and conversations, and in the observations of others; yet this evidence will never suffice, for the primal experiences that produce the basic character traits occur in the earliest years of life and are hidden from the subject himself by repression and other mechanisms of defense. Often they can be uncovered only after months and years of careful work by the subject interacting with a skilled analyst. Another obstacle for the historian is skepticism2-a tendency to regard",

The \"blocks\" of alters described by Katz, and the \"color paths\" to which Fotheringham's alters belonged, exemplify the kinds of jobs.

As a result, treating it as part of normal psychological functioning and emphasizing its usefulness seems almost blasphemous, and is regarded by some as devaluing creative talent or even rendering the idea of creativity meaningless. Indeed, there really does seem to be a danger of commodifying creativity and reducing it to fast food creativity—attractively packaged but lacking genuine nutritional value. However, a phase model of the process of creativity makes it possible to distinguish between sublime creativity, mundane creativity, and commodified creativity without attributing the former to forces beyond mere human existence. This conceptualization has practical consequences for, for instance, education.",

Instead, various host constructions such as the free-affectee construction (a subtype of which is the free-dative construction), monotransitive or applicative construction can – to a different degree – accommodate participants that are bound by a possession relation. The binding procedure identifying the possessor operates at the pragmatic-semantic interface and takes into account the semantic roles of the event participants, their discourse saliency and lexical properties (such as animacy), world knowledge, properties of the possessum (such as the degree of (in)alienability), etc. The external-possession relation and the meaning of the hosting construction are orthogonal to each other, but there is a strong interplay between them. Positing a dedicated external-possessor construction faces the following problems: the same binding procedure is found in other constructions as well (such as the monotransitive or ditransitive constructions); at the same time, the very possession relation is only inconsistently found in constructions referred to as external-possessor constructions, and, what is more, the possession relation may sometimes be canceled (even if it is inalienable). To account for this terminologically, I introduce the term non-thematic affectee construction , a subtype of which is the free (non-thematic) affectee construction particularly spread in European languages. The latter is found with different types of coding (accusative, dative, different prepositional phrases) which have different diachronic sources.",

Similarly, world development begins with self-management and self-development. In modern management, the primary or even an exclusive emphasis is laid on the management of externals like men, machine, material, money, market, method, organisation, environment, etc. But as eastern spiritual thinkers have repeatedly pointed out, right management of the internal self is the key to the successful management of the outer life and environment. Someone who cannot manage his own-self cannot effectively manage others or anything in the outer life. So self-management is the key to life management and ultimately world development. Man is the primary input to the management process. Man is not merely a mass of flesh, blood and bones. He is a mental creature in a physical frame. A worker as a man is a pack of feelings, emotions, sentiments, likes and dislikes priorities and preferences. He has his physique, his vital mind, heart, spirit and soul. Knowledge emerges from the inner being. Hence, the inner being of the man has to be suitably developed in order to make him creative and responsive. Thus, it becomes necessary to understand and know the management of self.",

      "abstract": "1. Artifact-Essentialism. To many, the reality of artifact kinds is at best a dubious matter.' Artifacts are manufactured by us, according to our own needs and circumstances; they are not the products of nature. Their artifactual essence will not be supported, therefore, by physical regularities, and thus cannot be objective. Is this inference correct, however? I will sketch a certain version of essentialism concerning artifacts (henceforward artifact-essentialism) and will explore how far such a position can be sustained. Artifact-essentialism does not have to maintain that all structures which humans apply to portions of stuff yield objects with independent conditions of identity. One should grant that many man-made things, such as statues or ornaments, are not objects over and above the portions of matter that make them up, in more than a conventional sense. Is it not true, nevertheless, that there exist artifacts thatfunction the way they do independently of the fact that we humans appreciate this? Given the prevailing laws of nature, similar circumstances, and the structures they have, would such objects not function in exactly the same way, even if no one were around to observe them? That the acquisition of some structures accords specific functions to articulated bodies is not at all a matter of convention; little is arbitrary or mind-dependent in the relation of such a structure-type with the function-type that correlates with it. The application of specific causes to any such articulated body yields certain effects of specific complexity, where, empirically speaking, there is a deterministic regularity, of the sort subsumable under an appropriate causal law. Indeed, it is a contingent and even an arbitrary matter that a particular piece of stuff should acquire a specific artifactual structure. Since artifacts are our own designs, the choice of the portions of matter upon which these designs are executed is again ours. But once such a design is executed, the resulting object will have the same function in every world the physical laws of which are the same as those of the actual, and it has that function",

Even cholera is not so formidable a disorder in the public esteem. Its cramps are not always present; and when they are, they are not comparable with the convulsions of hydrophobia. Nor is there any terrifying mental disorder in the case of cholera; whereas, in hydrophobia the morbid mental phenomena are more prominent, serious, and impressive than the motor ones. Moreover, cholera is not popularly believed to be necessarily and in all cases fatal; whereas it is currently supposed that there is no chance of escape from hydrophobia.",

This seems true for some behaviours in early childhood autism. Ethology has specialized in analyzing such non-verbal behaviour. Ethological motivation analysis, the study of context dependence and of the development of such behaviours in the individual patient should be exploited for their interpretation. Mere description of behaviour is not likely to contribute much. Psychiatric thinking on the interaction of genetic and environmental factors does not fully agree with ethological and biological views.",

The function of maslahah in the consumtion behavior isformulated as this equation: M = f ( X, Y, Bx, By). Based on this model, it could be expalained thatmaslalah is the outcome of an activity which can bring about berkah (benediction). In consequence, eachmoslem house hold will pay a big attantion to maslahah to do his economic goals. A moslem house holdwill select a good or service to consume if it will bring about berkah or not. It means that a moslemhouse hold doesn’t see the utility of the good or service which he will consume only, but also berkahwhich the good or service has. The behavior of finding berkah for a moslem house hold could be seenthrough his characters such as not wastefull, paying attantion to another person’s interest, not deceivingsomeone else, and rightfull.",

      "abstract": "In families, we can notice physical disorders in people living under the grip of the asymmetrical nature of narcissistic pervert links. The characteristic traits of these links are a degradation of one of the members of the link’s narcissistic integrity, together with a weakening of self-esteem, as a result of constant humiliations. The pervert’s victim suffers from fainting fits, allergic reactions, gastro-intestinal or vascular disorders, joints pain, somatizations or psychosomatic disorders with an anatomical starting point. The pervert can, in turn, develop physical disorders when he loses his superior stand and can’t express his distress, rant or hallucinate.The bond between the subjects of the link is weak or non -existent. There is a lack of mutual acknowledgement: the victim is not considered as a person by the pervert, he has no empathy towards the victim. The victim may even react with pleasure to belittlements thus encouraging him. The physical fits seem linked to the powerlessness to get rid of theses chains. The forces which look after self-protection are weakened. PFT and PCT cases will throw a light on these ideas.",

In the law, a ‘person’ is essentially the subject of rights and obligations, while a thing may be owned as property. In ethics, a person is an object of respect, to be valued for her own sake, and never to be used as a mere means to an end, while a thing has only a derivative value, and may be used as a means to some person's ends. This bifurcation is unfortunate because it seems to leave us with no alternative but to categorize everything as either a person or a thing. Yet some of the entities that give rise to the most vexing ethical problems are exactly the ones that do not seem to fit comfortably into either category. For various, different, kinds of reasons, it seems inappropriate to categorize a fetus, a non-human animal, the environment, or an object of great beauty, as a person, but neither does it seem right to say of such things that they are to be valued only as means.",

But any disclosure may be understood as a gift; it is not anthropomorphic to speak of “self-giving” with a wider reference than person-to-person disclosure. Which implies that no act of giving can exhaust itself in its gift. Present experience never brings closure to self-revealing. Yet giving is crystallized into “the given,” the closure of gift. “The given” is what it is, needing no gift-event to reveal it. But the given, too, is precarious, and can be destabilized when giving brings us face to face with something unfamiliar. Nothing appears without a promise of further appearances, and God himself can never be “given.”",

      "abstract": "Disposing of a piece of paper with a textual apotropaios might be even more problematic than storing or sharing it. A perfect example is a type of amulet named “heavenly letters”, “luck letters” or “chain letters”. Such a letter is often framed by its owner as an object or sacred/magic artifact which can act and produce non-beneficial effect on its own, without any human agency: one does not necessarily need to read or otherwise handle a luck letter to receive bad luck, while to receive good luck certain actions must be undertaken. Most often bad luck or a curse affects those who ignore or neglect a luck letter, and some of the later examples of this genre define at length different punishments for those who tear it or throw it away. Finding themselves in this situation, people turn to contemporary traditions of discarding sacred or malign artifacts. However, people often choose an intermediate strategy of giving a letter away, taking it to a specialist or discreetly passing it to a neighbor. The latter case is considered a malign magical activity. The intertwining between a luck letter as an autonomous force with a potential negative effect, “lay” senders and receivers and “specialists”, all bound together with the problem of discarding a magical object forms a complex and dynamic network of actors.",

Ayurveda’s contribution to “Health For All” should be evaluated from the perspective of its scientific application and explanation using contemporary language, all the while upholding the values and precepts reflected in the texts penned thousands of years ago with the aid of experience. “Ashtavidha ahara vidhi,” which depicts the manner of consuming food, as described by Charaka. Food cannot be effectively digested if these procedures are not followed or if there is a psychological issue. As a result, undigested food alters Annavaha srotasa’s physiology. Achieving endless desires in a brief amount of time results in numerous forms of worry, anxiety, anger, fear, and depression, all of which can cause different kinds of gastrointestinal tract diseases either directly or indirectly. Also, people today do not adhere to the “Dincharya” and “Ritucharya” regulations. These factors all throw off “Tridosha’s” balance. Normally Pitta has Katu rasa. When Katu rasa transforms into Vidagdha and achieves Shuktibhava, it produces Amlata in Amashaya, which is known as vitiation of Pitta dosha. Normally, Pitta has Katu rasa. One of the conditions brought on by vitiated Pitta is Amlapitta. In modern view “GERD” can be compared with Amlapitta. The main causes of gastric disorders, such as GERD, are dietetic patterns and psychological stress and pressure that affect our ability to digest food. The primary clinical diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is made on the basis of the common symptoms of acid regurgitation and heartburn.",

Three different viewpoints are successively adopted, from each of which man’s development is traced from childhood, through adolescence to complete maturity; at each stage far-reaching changes are seen to take place, and about the age of forty to forty-five a crisis normally occurs, which we shall have to discuss in some detail. A child is utterly self-centred, though his charm and simplicity prevent this from shocking us as it would in a grown-up. In his actions he always aims at getting his own way, which to a large extent means satisfying his physical needs. As he grows into a youth he enters into fuller possession of his mental and physical powers. He is haunted by the spirit of adventure and by vague ambitions (ambition itself, less generous, comes only later), for there seems no limit to what he is able to do. But for all his openness of heart he remains somewhat self-centred; it is the things that will allow him to live his own life, with his own personality, that he is striving after.",

In this article we argue that te-kureru does not inherently indicate benefaction, but rather that its occurrence, whether it is grammatically obligatory or optional, serves to intensify the speaker’s affective stance towards the referent in that given context. This accounts for the way in which this auxiliary may also contribute to expressions of sarcasm, anger, contempt, or retaliation. We propose that because malefaction is unfavourable to the speaker, the speaker deliberately takes a lower stance through te-kureru, making as if the other’s unfavourable action was taken from a higher position, which amounts to a putting down or deliberate neglect of the speaker. We also suggest that the auxiliary remains affectively neutral if the context is neither benefactive nor malefactive in orientation.",

On this view help should not be seen as stemming from the recognition of contingent differences between those who are inclined to help and those who are in need, nor as a one-time response to evil, or as an act close to heroism. Help should be seen as an element of the pursuit of one of the ends which are also duties, i.e. as the promotion of the happiness of others and, at the same time, the self-perfection of the helping person. Helping results from a stable readiness to act for the benefit of others, which stems from one’s recognition of the weakness, limitation, and lack of self-sufficiency which are common to all humans, and so are shared by both the helper and the person in need.",

I examine the reasons which justify the decision to withhold or discontinue active medical intervention in these patients.

His argument is based--not on consequential calculations or on social utility--but on the concept of personhood, as embodied in personal identity, quality of life, and responsibility for self. He maintains that, when the individual can no longer develop and express personality, pursue personal projects, show awareness and appreciation of life, and be morally responsible for his life and actions, then the person in an ethical sense is no longer alive. What remains is a body in which the former patient has no further interest.",

      "title": "Christian Faith and the Disposing of Human Life",
      "abstract": "T TOPIC of this essay is not the problem of the disposing of human life—whether considered from the point of view of philosophy or of moral theology. Nor is our concern the fundamental ethical or the concrete casuistical problems which belong to that topic. Rather, in this essay I will deal with the basic question of the significance attached to the faith in solving normative problems on the level of morally correct (right) behavior. But this question should not be approached theoretically; it should be presented exclusively by means of one example: the disposing of human life. When we speak of the disposing of human life, one thinks immediately and to a large extent of biological life. This is not wrong, but more basically it is a question of earthly human existence. As such, the various possibilities of disposing of human in some way through biological means play their particular roles. Here I am interested above all in the question of life/death, existence/nonexistence—and precisely as this question depends on human control, or lack of control, over these alternatives. There is no doubt that this involves causing the death of other persons. This problem not only involves reflections on the value and dignity of human and the so-called right of God as the Lord of human life; it also merits a reflection on the person's right to within society. The question of prenatal killing (abortion) and of the killing of the new-born would belong to this group of problems. In this area there are certainly still many points which are open to discussion. Yet in general, neither philosophy nor theology considers the prohibition against taking the of another as admitting of absolutely no exception. In the case of the taking of one's own life, the question of the right to does not arise; rather, it raises the question of the moral justification of killing in view of the value and dignity of human as well as that of the sovereign right of God over all human life. In what follows, I shall limit myself (though not exclusively) to the problem of the taking of one's own life, whether in suicide or in a sacrificial death or in euthanasia. The problem of Christian faith and the disposing of human life seems to be especially acute today in this area.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The term “faith” is frequently used in a generic sense without any religious or theological significance. Philosophers and others use it to mean the acceptance as true or real of anything that is not immediately evident or demonstrable. In this sense faith is an ingredient in virtually all human knowledge and activity. Whenever I read the newspapers, speak about history or science, and in fact whenever I get on a train, eat a meal, or perform many other ordinary actions, I am implicitly making acts of human or natural—that is to say, non-theological—faith. In so doing I may be following a spontaneous instinct, an acquired habit, or a free, voluntary decision. I may be said to be exercising faith in my senses, in my memory, in the reliability of a machine, or in the competence and integrity of other persons. The term “faith” is especially appropriate in the case of firm beliefs involving implicit trust in another person or other persons. Faith in this case is closely connected with love and loyalty. The English word “believe” is etymologically connected with the word “love,” just as the Latin credereimplies a gift of the heart (cordare). Faith normally leads to faithful action, which is a matter of”keeping faith” with persons or living up to one’s commitments. When a person is said to have or profess a faith, the reference may be to a com­prehensive vision that serves to give an interpretation of life as whole, including a scale of values. For convinced adherents, philosophical systems such as Platonism and ideologies such as Marxist Communism serve as faiths of a quasi-religious type. Faith in the theological sense includes everything connected with the secular meaning of the term. But over and above this, it is a response to God as he acts and manifests himself in the world and in human consciousness.",

      "title": "Synchronization and Self-Organization in Organizations. The Combinatory System© View.",
      "abstract": "In any organization people may be observed from two different points of view: first of all as organs (or components of organs), in the sense that organizational relationships assign them a precise spatial and temporal placement, they carry out a specialized function in relation to the entire structure, they have a specific functionality that delimits the admissible interactions with the other elements, and they show a particular functioning; secondly , as members of a social collectivity in which, independently of their organizational role and connections, they appear as similar agents , moved by private objectives, capable of producing micro decisions, behaviours and effects relatively analogous to that of the others. My study considers the second aspect of human behaviour in organizations and aims to present a simple theory - the Theory of Combinatory Systems - which may allow us to describe, explain, and to a certain extent control many relevant and intriguing collective phenomena and their observable effects, which are produced by agents acting as unorganized social systems, even if they are also members of an organizational structure. In plain words I define as a combinatory system any collectivity (composed of individuals or organizations) whose agents, consciously or unconsciously, act (exclusively or prevalently) on the basis of global information which they direcly produce and update as the consequence of their micro behaviours. On the one hand, the global information is - or derives from – a synthetic variable whose values are produced by the combination of the micro states of the agents (hence the name Combinatory System ) but, on the other, these values affect the subsequent states as a result of a micro-macro feedback , acting over a period of time, that produces self-organization in the agents’ micro behaviours. If we accept the traditional definition of self-organization as the macro behaviour of a collectivity of agents in which the micro behaviours appear to be “directed”, or “organized”, by an Invisible Hand , or Supreme Authority , in order to produce the emerging phenomenon represented by the formation of ordered structures, of recognizable patterns, then it is easy to recognize that the macro phenomena produced by the macro behaviour of the system become factors in self-organization, since they are interpreted by the agents as information they can base their decisions on. In other words, the invisible hand is nothing other than the synergetic effect of the micro-macro feedback action (or circular causality ) that generates and updates the global information that produces self-organization and emerging macro behaviours attributable to the collectivity.",

The worker becomes an ever cheaper commodity the more commodities he creates. The worker can create nothing without nature, without the sensuous external world. It is the material on which his labor is realized, in which it is active, from which, and by means of which it produces. Certainly eating, drinking, procreating, etc., are also genuinely human functions. But taken abstractly, separated from the sphere of all other human activity and turned into sole and ultimate ends, they are animal functions. Through estranged, alienated labor, then, the worker produces the relationship to this labor of a man alien to labor and standing outside it. The relationship of the worker to labor creates the relationship to it of the capitalist. Private property is thus the product, the result, the necessary consequence, of alienated labor, of the external relation of the worker.",

      "abstract": "ions of the mind, as Plato did so long ago, is a disservice because it asks us to reject This is not meant to diminish the fact that some people do feel trapped in their body either because of the extreme pain or because it feels like the wrong body for one reason or another. I would suggest, however, that perhaps much of this imagery of feeling trapped is due to the dissociation that is taught in a dualistic society (or even that dissociation which is necessary to survive mentally in a dualized community that is itself rejecting). Perhaps this dissociation makes people believe that not only are the two parts separable, but that the body is generally responsible for their negative experiences. Less dissociation and more acceptance of people as whole and situated individuals, might well lessen these experiences which mirror this artificial but current state of the society generally–but such is only possible in a world that accepts bodies and human variation. 77 important aspects of ourselves, of others and our connections to them, and makes it impossible for us to come to terms with ourselves as whole, integrated and bodily beings. The fact that dualisms still exist may seem unimpressive to some, just as the believed existence of yin and yang does not seem especially problematic to some Eastern thinkers. The point that women are associated with one side of this dualism, the side that is less valued, is unfortunate for them but does not in itself adequately refute dualism as a concept and means of understanding the world, such thinkers might argue. I think there is sufficient evidence that the harm dualism does, and the inequalities it produces, is at least adequate to challenge its usefulness and fairness. Even those readers who might reject these points surely could not easily maintain that dualism is an accurate account of human experience as it exists in the world. Granted many people believe that their mind and body are quite separate in some way, but the opinions of the masses are not in themselves adequate proof, one might think. However the average person does not experience their body as radically separate from themselves. One does not generally seek out or welcome a means of killing the body such that their immortal mind might be free to do more important things than the material tasks of maintaining a body. People experience their bodies as themselves. When physical pain is experienced–it is not just reasoned away and when psychic or emotional pain is experienced, often the body reflects that anguish. It is not just my mind that decides if I feel happy today but also my body which is me as well. The next chapter will discuss",

Nor does He need these signs for the human mind to be laid bare to Him. But in this way a man excites himself to pray more and to groan more humbly and more fervently. I do not know how it is that, although these motions of the body cannot come to be without a motion of the mind preceding them, when they have been made, visibly and externally, that invisible inner motion which caused them is itself strengthened. And in this manner the disposition of the heart which preceded them in order that they might be made, grows stronger because they are made. Of course if someone is constrained or even bound, so that he cannot do these things with his limbs, it does not follow that, when he is stricken with remorse, the inner man does not pray and prostrate himself before the eyes of God in his most secret chamber.

      "abstract": "Imagine discourse between the arts in which the conventions of what we might call ordinary cognition do not apply, on site of intense lobbying neither tethered by history or cultural integrity, nor, frequently, concerned with social cohesion or communicative norms. It will be discourse in which the categories of an imperial culture are abrogated (however temporarily) by an indigenous one, yet it will undoubtedly also be site of intense colonization. On it, likewise, there will be an appropriation of language on an unprecedented scale. Past experience will play little part. Memory short and episodic, rather than semantic. It primal discourse. Primal in that it the site of first contact. Primal also in that it most often considered be the meeting of primitive culture and an advanced. Primal, likewise, in behavioral sense: in it, the satisfaction of physiological needs tantamount. Indeed, body and mind here are in state of kinetic unrest. This scene of prolonged immat urity, yet ontological and epistemological questions held in private language are encouraged be made public. Here the verbal arts have no canon. Literature has no prevailing cultural standard of merit. Questions of the popular and the high cultural are not naturalized and the fictional and nonfictional carry the same degree of verisimilitude as works of propaganda, rhetoric, and didacticism. In modem times, the West has become the site of this tenacious yet frequently unacknowledged imperial discourse, the discourse between multifarious forms of artistic representation win the attention of children. It in such discourse that the picture book located. 1 Arguing the need for critical language for the discussion of children's picture books, Peter Hunt suggests that to pictures into the same mould as words seems be potentially unproductive, except in terms of establishing conventions, when, of course, it is, by definition, necessary (181). It impossible, however, conventionalize pictorial representation the same degree as linguistic representation. Linguistic systems are mastered painstakingly, piece by piece, referent by referent, word by word. Pictorial systems, by contrast, are mastered all at once; they involve what Flint Schier has called natural generativity and are therefore much less conventional than linguistic systems. Each system, nevertheless, relies on general agreement and on willingness engage in communicative activity: the pictorial system on deep recognitional capacities that link object and its picture, the linguistic system on lexical and syntactical regularities and rules. In the media-saturated culture of the contemporary West, the commonalities and differences of our separate but shared experiences are frequently offered up in televisual or hypertextual format in which what Hunt describes as force set of discursive practices that address and interpellate both adults and children as potential viewers or listeners. The linguistic and the pictorial are frequently experienced as synergistic or polylogic systems bound up in this mass media, media whose intention, according Jean Baudrillard, transcribe the complexity of contemporary life into an ongoing procession of meaningless simulacra, hyperreal, a real without origin or reality (2). Baudrillard's disenchanted vision of postmodernity, articulated most profoundly in the late 1970s and 1980s, produced an interesting ontological metaphor. Disneyland, he claimed, is there conceal the fact that it the 'real' country, all of 'real' America, which Disneyland (just as prisons are there conceal the fact that it the social, in its entirety, in its banal omnipresence, which carceral). Disneyland presented as imaginary in order make us believe that the rest real, when in fact all of Los Angeles and the America surrounding it are no longer real, but of the order of the hyperreal and of simulation (25). …",

Evolved behavior, including that of other animals, is not entirely devoid of normativity, however. Defining normativity as adherence to an ideal or standard, there is ample evidence that animals treat their social relationships in this manner. In other words, they pursue social values. Here I review evidence that nonhuman primates actively try to preserve harmony within their social network by, e.g., reconciling after conflict, protesting against unequal divisions, and breaking up fights amongst others. In doing so, they correct deviations from an ideal state. They further show emotional self-control and anticipatory conflict resolution in order to prevent such deviations. Recognition of the goal-orientation and normative character of animal social behavior permits us to partially bridge the is/ought divide erected in relation to human moral behavior.",

Or we make a conceptual leap and ask more abstract questions about the conditions for agency. They include autonomy and self-appraisal, each contested by arguments immersing us in circumstances we don’t control. But can it be true we that have no personal responsibility for all we think and do? 'Agency: Moral Identity and Free Will' proposes that deliberation, choice, and free will emerged within the evolutionary history of animals with a physical advantage: organisms having cell walls or exoskeletons had an internal space within which to protect themselves from external threats or encounters. This defense was both structural and active: such organisms could ignore intrusions or inhibit risky behavior. Their capacities evolved with time: inhibition became the power to deliberate and choose the manner of one’s responses. Hence the ability of humans and some other animals to determine their reactions to problematic situations or to information that alters values and choices. This is free will as a material power, not as the conclusion to a conceptual argument. Having it makes us morally responsible for much we do. It prefigures moral identity. Closely argued but plainly written, 'Agency: Moral Identity and Free Will' speaks for autonomy and responsibility when both are eclipsed by ideas that embed us in history or tradition. Our sense of moral choice and freedom is accurate. We are not altogether the creatures of our circumstances.",

In the common-sense epistemology of the West, there has long been a tendency to phrase behavior in goal-directed terms: to refer behavior in all instances to ends, or end-states, which are believed to restore some lack, deficiency, or deprivation in the organism. Once in possession of the notion of value properties, it is clear that they are not specifically \"motivational but, rather, that motivational relational features of experience and action as are discriminated by that concept will be ubiquitous in psychological functioning.

One dimension is concerned with attribution of moral blame. Thomas Nagel explains: \"If one negligently leaves the bath running with the baby in it, one will realize, as one bounds up the stairs towards the bathroom, that if the baby has drowned one has done something awful, whereas if it has not one has merely been careless.\" How badly one has behaved and hence how much one should be blamed turns on consequences beyond one's control - on luck. The other dimension concerns the existence and extent of one's responsibility for having done harm, one's obligation to someone harmed to make amends for or repair the harm done. Someone who has been careless and lucky enough not to injure anyone has no such obligation. Someone who has been equally careless and inflicted a devastating injury may well have a ruinous obligation.",

Unfallen Adam is able to establish a subjectivity because of his innate and extraordinary mental competence. Reproducing the image of God as it is, which Milton calls “the spirit within thee free”(8.440), this spirit is only bestowed upon free human beings with the ability to act willingly. The key issue is how Adam continues to sustain this spiritual capability in the process of his formation of the unfallen subject. Adam must demonstrate his successful efforts in dealing with various issues as he proceeds with his self-understanding related to the formation of his subject. However, there is a possibility for Adam to make wrong choices, thus failing to form a successful subject. In the sense that Adam’s subject formation is exposed to the danger of desubjectivity, it swings uncertainly between an already formed subject and a not yet formed subject. Because Adam’s subjective perfection is dependent and conditional, he must constantly maintain or reflect its original form and source. Here, Adam needs to go through a process of training and education to solidify the completeness of a given subjectivity. Without education and training, it is impossible that the unfallen subjectivity characterized by God’s providence can be established in any form. Adam reaches the consummation of forming his unfallen subject only through educational enlightenment and progress as shown clearly in the conversation between God and Adam about the necessity of Adam’s partner.",

      "abstract": "The Igbo term for a good person is ezigbo mmadu. It is a term that is descriptive of good character or positive moral conduct in a person or group of persons. Among the Igbo, a person is designated as ezigbo mmadu, who possesses good conduct or moral fibre – qualities that are worthy of emulation by others. But ezigbo mmadu is not merely  descriptive of a person‟s character or conduct; it is also expressive of a person who is equable, unflappable, even-tempered and level-headed. Ezigbo mmadu has as its converse, the phrase ajo mmadu. Ajo mmadu is a term used to describe a bad man or woman, where the word ajo means „bad‟, that is, the opposite of „good‟. A person is ajo mmadu who is flawed or defective in character. With particular focus on ezigbo mmadu, the Igbo identify some special qualities of life a person must possess before he or she can be so described. In the pre-colonial setting, for example, apart from the possession of good moral conduct, a person was considered ezigbo mmadu who respected the customary laws of community and was loyal to the preternatural forces that ruled in the cosmic order. In this paper, however, it is discovered that the challenges of modernity and the harsh social environment in which the modern Igbo have found themselves seem to greatly tint their conceptualisation of who an ezigbo mmadu is. The paper does not only identify reasons for the devaluation of this once venerated concept or positive social attribute; it also proffers possible remedies to overcoming this social dilemma.",

      "abstract": "At The present time, reason is not held in any too great esteem; “rationalism” is deprecated in most intellectual circles. “To believe in reason” is to be behind the times, to give evidence of a mode of thinking that is out of date, out of contact with what today is called “progress.” The “belief in reason” is now replaced by all sorts of psychological and sociological sciences: the psychology of the unconscious, of the subconscious, of behavior, of suppressed desires and conditioned reflexes. The variety of sociologies is no less disconcerting—not should we forget the sociological psychologies and the psychological sociologies. Formerly man was considered to be an animal rationale , a rational being; now he has become simply a vital being, not further qualified. Since man lives in community with his fellows, it was formerly the practice to inquire into the structure and organization which society ought to have in order to correspond to the rational and human nature of its members. But today no such question is raised; it is taken for granted that man, as a social animal, must adjust himself to his environment or suffer the consequence to his well-being and his happiness. It is no longer a question of whether one may or one should adjust oneself to certain social conditions: it is now only a question of what is the most effective means or technique of adjustment.",

      "title": "A Duplex Model for Giftedness",
      "abstract": "This article proposes a duplex model for understanding giftedness. The first part of the duplex is the set of gifted skills and attitudes that one possesses as a result of heredity, the environment, and their interaction. It is the input that one has acquired from one’s life experiences. The second part of the duplex is the utilization or deployment of gifted skills and attitudes. On this view, giftedness, like intelligence, in practice heavily depends upon one’s attitudes toward deployment of abilities, not just the abilities themselves. It is the output that one gifts back to the world. Someone may possess giftedness in the first part of the duplex but give very little back in the second part. Alternatively, someone may make gifted contributions but not be identified as having the characteristics usually associated with giftedness. This can result because giftedness can be either trait-like or state-like. Some people act in gifted ways as a function of their interactions with tasks and situations, although they would not have been predicted to be individuals who would act that way. A full model should allow both for input and output—giftedness as a possession but also giftedness as it is deployed to make the world a better place.",

      "abstract": "When two persons meet together to discuss some enterprise or future event, or other speculative matter, without coming to an agreement, they may separate by one thinking or calling the other an optimist and the other thinking or calling his opponent a pessimist. Thereby they settle the matter temporarily, although of course they leave it undecided and agree only to differ. What they really settle is that two congenitally different temperaments necessarily view the subject from two different aspects and conclude accordingly. They do not stay to enquire which is the true view, the one being inclined by his temperament to look on the dark side of things and see the evils, hates, strifes, sufferings, failures and follies in the world, the other inclined by his temperament to look on their bright side and accordingly see the good, love, joys, and successes in it. Why, indeed, should they stop to enquire? Every mind in the world necessarily construes it in terms of itself, and therefore feels and thinks its individual world—the mind of the fool a different world from that of the sage, the mind of the sinner from that of the saint, the mind of the Andaman Islander from that of the Anglo-Saxon, the mind of the particular person from that of his neighbour. There must naturally be one common world in the necessarily common notion of a like-structured species, but there are as many particular worlds as there are persons in it.",

      "abstract": "The attempt not to think or to block out particular mental contents is cited by addicts as a motivation for intoxication as frequently as the need to escape any external set of circumstances. Compulsive drug use may therefore be seen as an attempt to obliterate particular states of mind. In this paper addicts are considered as dangerously addicted to a loss of contact with parts of the mind as they are to a given drug. A splitting off, for example, of loving and nurturing or hateful parts of the personality is effected where these cannot be tolerated by or integrated into a pathological internal constellation. Deficits in early caregiving and environment as well as constitutional factors play a part in this. Addiction is therefore seen as an unconscious attempt to maintain a precarious inner equilibrium by destroying contact with parts of the personality, literally through their drugging. In psychic reality or in phantasy this may be felt as a slicing up or tearing to pieces, and so subjugation of objects. A clinical example will illustrate this idea.",

      "title": "Decision‐making and Neuroeconomics",
      "abstract": "Abstract Decision‐making is the process of choosing one out of several alternatives. The study of decision‐making is inherently multidisciplinary and can be approached from many different angles. Traditional accounts in economics and biology have a normative flavour and prescribe, rather than describe decision‐making. Recently, however, efforts in psychology and behavioural ecology have resulted in the development of theories with higher descriptive validity. Furthermore, neuroeconomics is a new interdisciplinary field that combines contributions from economics, biology and psychology and aims to identify a biologically valid, mechanistic, mathematical and behavioural theory of choice and exchange. Recent neurophysiological advances have further deepened our understanding of the mechanistic implementation of a decision in the brain. Key Concepts Utility function : A mathematical function that models the relationship between an objective measure of a commodity (such as money) and the subjective value or desirability of that commodity. The utility function is often assumed to be concave, which is supposed to underly risk aversion. Risk attitude : Animals and humans are almost never risk neutral, i.e. when choosing between a very risky and a less risky (or even certain) option, most organisms prefer the less risky option ( risk aversion ) even if the payoff of both options is identical, or even better for the risky option. Occasionally, some individuals systematically prefer the more risky option ( risk proneness ). Expected utility theory : Normatively flavoured model in economics that tries to prescribe how humans should make decisions under risk. It is assumed that decision‐makers compute the probability‐weighted sum of the utilities of all possible outcomes, integrate them with their current asset, and then choose the option the highest expected utility in final assets. Discounted utility theory : Similar model to expected utility, but for decisions in time. The weighting factor in discounted utility theory is not probability, but a function of the delay between choice and consumption. Game theory : Framework to formalize choice behaviour involving multiple interacting decision‐makers. A game allows to isolate and investigate in a controlled environment a limited set of premises of economic decision theory. Prospect theory : Alternative theory to expected utility theory with higher descriptive validity. It is assumed that outcomes of a decision are evaluated with respect to changes in wealth (gains versus losses), not in final states. Furthermore, the utility function is concave in the domain of gains, and convex in the domain of losses, and steeper for losses than for gains. Choice heuristic : A simple decision rule, or set of rules, that humans and animals apply to make decisions in complex environments. Optimal foraging theory : Based on the assumption that evolution should have favoured the development of decision mechanisms that maximize Darwinian fitness, optimal foraging theory aims to explore animal behaviour from an optimal choice perspective. Neuroeconomics : Interdisciplinary field that attempts to identify a biologically valid, mechanistic, mathematical and behavioural theory of choice and exchange.",

      "title": "A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT OF HIGH AND LOW ADJUSTMENT LEVEL STUDENTS",
      "abstract": "Human situation is a constant one. New conditions and problems are constantly setting the individual right from his infancy to his deathbed, and he is invariably engaged in trying to find a satisfactory and pleasurable solution to them by employing his intelligence and other gifts of the mind and body. In other words, life is the name of unceasing process, the process of adjustment. “Adjustment is the process by which a living organism maintains a balance between its needs and the circumstances that influence the satisfaction of these needs” accordingly, the process of adjustment has two primary or main elements: one, the needs of the living organism; and two the conditions of circumstances influencing these needs. These needs can be biogenic, Originating in the society, personal or community, or arising from any other conceivable source. On the other hand, circumstances influencing these needs also can be either inside individual or outside him. Factors within the individuals that influence these needs are his physical and mental states, capacity, attitudes interests, etc. Three Elements in Adjustment An analysis of the process of adjustment of the processes of adjustment will reveal the presence of three main elements: - Motive: The very process of adjustment in the living being is set in motion by the presence within him of some motive or need or requirement. - Thwarting Condition: When the environment does not present any features that tend to become obstacles in the fulfillment of these needs, then the adjustment in natural, facile and effortless, and does not problem in result. However, if circumstances create obstacle in the path of such fulfillment, then the process of adjustment progresses further. -  Varied Responses :  Once the fulfillment of a need has obstructed, individual indulges in various actions, which are a reaction to the obstacle. Such a reaction can be normal just as much as it can be abnormal. -  Solution: Because of these reactions and responses, the individual achieves a degree of adjustment with the circumstances. The problem of adjustment in there by solved. - Motive and adjustment :  Generally speaking, the process of adjustment can be set in motion by any motive.  For example, our physical needs are constantly being manifesting in the form of adjective behavior patterns. However, from our point of view, these needs do not have much importance, for life, itself ceases in the organism, thus obviating all further adjustment activity. Need of study : - present time all people are salves of their problem in presently situations and his determinative life goals. Present time all people have set their life goals to earn a lot of money. In Past time all human being decided his life goal “mocha”. The persons do efforts to gain a lot of money in any situation or from any work .All situation have balanced human behaviors; this work’s main factor is adjustment level. Based on previous research finding conclusion the well adjustable persons have conducted their work very smoothly, and all decisions taken were correct.  From This concepts question arises. What does high adjustment level students achieved on high academic achievement?   Adjustment works normally in every circumstance of human life. Similarly, adjustments on learning achievement would work normally, considering how logical this fact is this study has done. Statement of the problem : - “A comparative study of academic achievement of high and low adjustment level students”",

      "title": "Perspective on Ethics: The Elephant in the Room",
      "abstract": "While the field of bioethics is increasingly equated with medicine and healthcare, the purview of bioethics actually includes human interaction with all things biological—whether those interactions are with other humans, other sentient and non-sentient entities, even the very earth itself, since it is, after all, one of those necessary conditions for the very possibility of our existence. Much like our cohorts in medicine and healthcare, those of us currently laboring in the field of bioethics pay lip-service to the importance of developing at least a biopsychosocial—if not also environmental —perspective when addressing problems or issues. But when advocating for such an “all-things-considered” perspective we, again like our cohorts in medicine and healthcare, tend to ignore the material conditions, the biological, psychological, social and the environmental, that actually spawn and/or aggravate the complex, chronically occurring, and broadly (though often subtly) interconnected problems or issues we address. This leads to a myopia, it prevents us from being able to helping to identify the broadest range of possible solutions to the problems we focus on, or in some cases the consequences of our proposed solutions. A case in point: bioethicists continue to stress the importance of autonomy while, at the same time, we fail to point out how basic economic and political arrangements actually set the framework for any meaningful understanding of autonomy to occur. Take, for example, the increasing availability of insurance-subsidized IVF in the US, a nation where the official poverty rate in 2009 was 14.3 percent (20.7% for children under 18 years of age), and where the percentage of people without health insurance coverage increased from 15.4 percent to 16.7 percent over the same period.1 What does autonomy effectively mean for the couple seeking IVF? For the child in poverty? For the person without health insurance? They all live in the same country, under much the same social or political arrangements, arrangements that have helped to create and now perpetuate the ability of some to fulfill not only their basic needs, along with their wants and desires. Yet at the same time, many of their basic needs will go unmet. Loosely paraphrasing John Dewey, we might ask how a country that hoists the banner of the ideal, autonomy in this instance, can march in the direction of continual disregard concerning not only such basic inequities, but also such pressing issues as overpopulation, pollution on a global scale, global warming, the likely extinction of various flora and fauna. All of these things drastically impinge on the longterm robust autonomy of all for what might be the very short-term benefit of a select few.2 Autonomy has rightly become the backbone of discussions in bioethics in the US. But we might now initiate meaningful discussion about what that autonomy means and how best to secure it. This would move us past the thought that autonomy is an abstract ideal, and towards the idea that it can reveal a reality lived, not just by some, but every biologically, psychologically, socially and environmentally situated self.",

      "abstract": "Like all human behaviors, labor-management behaviors are based on ethics and custom as well as law. Although a conflict between labor and capital is caused by non-legal matters, after all it should be managed within legal procedure and the institutional frame. However, the cause of it will not be necessarily focused on its legal aspect, but rather it is worth considering how ethical issues and the custom of an industrial society, which take place regardless of law, have an influence on a legal area. Providing a different view and a clash between labor and management are referred to as labor-management conflicts on a general basis, aspects of them will be divided into 8 categories in light of law, ethics and custom, and conflicts of each category will be analyzed. A human being is an animal of desire that does not stop their indefinite desire, facing definite materials, so they need the compelling force of something fatalistically while they do not behave meaningless behaviors and at the same time they are willing to die in a good cause. Besides, now that they are such a respectful animal of an old tradition that they want to follow that, custom has something contradictory of law or ethics combined and melt in it, and therefore it should not be ruled out of crucial behavioral principles between labor and capital. What are important to solve labor-management conflicts are a consideration of ethics and the custom of an industrial culture in terms of the interpretation and application of law, and an improvement in the expertise of both a labor relations commission and conflict arbitrators. For the sake of that, the introduction of a labor court should be seriously reviewed and the ongoing private arbitration mediation system complemented and developed. Looking at the realities of labor-management relationships, the merciless execution of law brings about resistance based on ethical emotions, which stay under custom; behaviors drawn by them endanger law and order; and those complexes are mixed and co-exist, so that the positive law needs an ethical meaning and ethical feelings need a law-abiding meaning to draw empathy with each other somehow. This research aims at seeking for solutions to the conflicts to realize that objective in an effective way.",

      "title": "EVIL FOR FREEDOM'S SAKE?",
      "abstract": "Christianity teaches that whenever evil is done, God had ample warning. He could have prevented it, but He didn't. He could have stopped it midway, but He didn't. He could have rescued the victims of the evil, but – at least in many cases – He didn't. In short, God is an accessory before, during, and after the fact to countless evil deeds, great and small. An explanation is not far to seek. The obvious hypothesis is that the Christian God is really some sort of devil. Maybe He is a devil as popularly conceived, driven by malice. Or maybe He is unintelligibly capricious. Or maybe He is a fanatical artist who cares only for the aesthetic quality of creation – perhaps the abstract beauty of getting rich variety to emerge from a few simple laws, or perhaps the concrete drama of human life with all its diversity – and cares nothing for the good of the creatures whose lives are woven into His masterpiece. (Just as a tragedian has no business providing a happy end out of compassion for his characters.) But no; for Christianity also teaches that God is morally perfect and perfectly benevolent, and that He loves all of His creatures; and that these things are true in a sense not a million miles from the sense in which we attribute morality, benevolence, or love to one another. We turn next to the hypothesis that God permits evil-doing for the sake of its good effects.",

      "abstract": "Every individual experience a variety of different emotions during a lifetime. This can range from feelings of happiness, anger, love, jealously, pity, sadness, agony, hate and others. Emotion is what provides individuals with a sense of being alive. They are a response to life’s experiences and situations that we encounter through a combination of feelings, thoughts, and action. They constitute towards human behavior and to a certain extent ethical behavior is based on emotion (Goleman, 1995). Human emotion can be separated into two categories including positive emotion and negative emotion that is further accompanied by both physiological and psychological changes. Positive emotions help us to develop joy, interest, gratitude, love in which the person always feel good and remains active with physiological and psychological state of mind. However, when we have negative vibes around then the physiological and psychological state of mind can lead to changes in body gestures, facial expressions, movement of the muscles. In addition, non-voluntary reactions like changes in heat rate, increased pulse rate, high blood pressure and perspiration. The effects of negative emotions always weaken your body’s immune system and give you stress, anxious, or upset and lead to demotivation. The demotivation factor will take you loneliness, frustration, anger, emptiness, fear etc. So, one of the best ways to live life positively is to control our emotions by learning and developing Emotional Intelligence in our life.",

Or perhaps it would be more appropriate to say that they have substance and meaning only as it is lent to them by the personal interests and assumptions of individuals, so that they change from generation to generation, from country to country, from circumstance to circumstance. The traditional dilemma of free will or determinism is entirely artificial, like most exclusive alternatives of a high order of abstraction. Freedom is subjectively illusory, if the absence of any experience of constraint depends upon the absence of a desire to do what one would be prevented from doing. It is the instinctive recognition of this truth that links the experience of a lack of freedom with the idea of oppression and tyranny. When men feel the loss of freedom they behave as though someone were responsible.",

      "title": "Prurigo: Where are you?",
      "abstract": "The definition of moral qualities, merits, virtues, defects, failings and deficiencies is not precise and words do not allow us to evaluate properly these characteristics. It also happens with many human and animal perceptions and sensations. We can physically define and measure accurately ocular and auditory sensitivity and discernment. Colour and tones may objectively be evaluated and quantified. However, we do not have the same possibilities with the other senses. Smell is defined comparatively to other more or less precise and distinct odours that, in fact, are variable, complex and composite. Taste has also the same imprecise characteristics. And touch is probably the less developed sense, particularly in humans, in spite of its crucial role in the relationship with other individuals and the development and expression of affection, love and sex. Smell, taste and touch have also the same imprecise possibility of quantitative evaluation, from mild to strong, without a valid and objective scale of measurement. It is in this field of imprecise sensations where we can place itching (pruritus). Pruritus is a subjective manifestation, almost specific to skin and some stratified mucous membranes, which could be described as a feeling that provokes an imperious need for scratching (what a failure of concretion!). Pain, itch, burning, tingling and tickling are some of these diverse tactile or soreness-related sensations often associated with skin diseases. Itch is a characteristic of multiple skin disorders, from atopy to allergic reactions, from lymphoma to lichen planus and scabies. And there are individuals who, due to one of these conditions, suffer itch over a long period and, because of it, develop severe psychological alterations. It is well known that chronic pruritus is associated with loss of quality of life. However, scratching a pruriginous area is so satisfying that it has been supposed that Henry VIII said that itch must be kept for the King of England, to maintain the pleasure of rubbing for the Royalty. Pruritus is a non-specific manifestation but, often, its chronology, rhythm, location or other characteristics permit a precise diagnosis of the cause. Although, from the beginning and for more than a century, dermatologists recognized skin diseases by their morphology and associated subjective manifestations, in recent times the enlarging knowledge of aetiopathogenic mechanisms changed definition and even the terminology of many skin disorders. And dermatologists are now much more interested in the accuracy of their language.1,2 The term T-cell lymphoma has progressively replaced the old mycosis fungoides. We do not any more call ‘herpes’ a fungal disease and ‘mycosis’ a malignant proliferative condition. Therefore, if in some fields the old morphological terms have been changed to new ones related to the origin or mechanism of the disease, it would appear suitable to try to eradicate others as prurigo. The term prurigo has been largely used in the past and still persists in dermatological literature. However, prurigo only means ‘undefined cutaneous reaction associated with variable itching and usually of unknown origin’. At the time when the physiopathological mechanisms and the causes of pruritus are much better known than in the past, it appears archaic still to keep this name in our books and journals. Of course the cause of the very curious prurigo pigmentosa nicely reported in this issue by Matsumoto et al. is not clear and, by now, this very peculiar reaction has not been identified with other diseases as dermatitis herpetiformis or erythema multiforme. Maybe for these special cases it would be preferable to use a descriptive term (as recurrent reticular pruritic pigmentary eruption, as we do with the pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy) or the name of the first author who described the disease (in this case it would be Nagashima’s disease). Until the identification of the aetiology of the disease or the mechanism responsible for this peculiar reaction is reached, a descriptive/mnemonic designation or one related to the first report would be temporarily more adequate than to maintain the old word prurigo that appears as old fashioned as if we still used the term noli me tangere for ulcerated basal cell carcinoma. Or … we can continue with the very peculiar terminology of dermatology, using in the twenty-first century, botanical names, such as lichen, for cell-mediated immunological reactions. It is also a poetical and a delicious fashion.3,4 Why not if, at the time of revolutionary technology, black and white films (The Battleship Potemkin, Un chien andalou, The Seventh Seal, Casablanca, and many others) not only persist but still represent some or the main achievements of motion pictures?",

If many of them had not employed the word utility in two senses, and hopped from one to the other as best suited their momentary convenience, they never would have appeared as either so singular or so important as some people for a year or two were inclined to hold them. Utility in its popular, and as we believe, its legitimate sense, means nothing more than applicability to the practical and ordinary affairs of life, as distinguished from its enjoyments and its higher duties. As the foundation of a moral theory, it signifies that the only standard of right and wrong, is the view taken by the agent, of the consequences of his actions in the production of pleasure and pain. The few persons who maintain that utility in the former of these senses, is alone or chiefly worthy of attention, assume a ground so narrow and repulsive, that they have little chance of converting the world. The others announce as the basis of a system of morals, a notion, which, in truth, excludes all real morality, arising from the operation of the conscience. It is, however, in this larger signification, that utility has been employed as a watchword by the ablest of those who have shouted it among the astonished vulgar. We have of course a very firm conviction, that they profess a grievous and most pernicious error; but we are far from thinking that all those who do so are consciously unprincipled; and the very article before us, the first in the XXIIIrd number of the Westminster Review, is an evidence of more than average honesty in the writer.",

Of course, anything must be temporarily abstracted and in some sense distorted in order to be studied at all. One fixates upon any given thing under discussion, precisely as one focuses a camera or a microscope; and this process in some sense temporarily plays down the rest of the universe. Any field of science or action gets ahead with its proper business largely by concentrating on things interior to itself. This is why we must have division of labor among our specialties. But recurrently, and especially at the times when one resets goals for future work, it is relevant to ask: How does the rest of what is going on iii the social universe outside my specialty impinge upon what I am trying to do and upon the way I state my problems? The significance of the interrupting pressure of the rest of the social world upon the component parts of a social system and its culture varies with time and location.

Free energy, that we may liken to a kind of noise, is bound and organized in a process where subjective meaning is created. During this process, a meaningful connection between inner and outer reality is established. However, subjectivity also creates problems, since the individual needs to find his or her own self-realization, his or her own path towards the grave. Self-realization contains an aggressive potential, which—reminiscent of the workings of the immune system—may be aimed at everything that is not-self; at the unfamiliar or that which causes discomfort; at that which blocks the path towards the individual's mastery of the world.",

This process begins with the individual’s increasing deep awareness of self-knowledge. The process of self-knowledge enables the individual to explore his inner world and understand emotional states. “Being me” requires being spiritually strong. Spiritually strong people manage their emotions, thoughts and behaviors in a way that provides them success in life. Determining priorities means understanding what the individual values in life and acting accordingly. Likewise, knowing responsibilities and boundaries allows for a healthy balance in social relationships and maintaining the necessary space for personal growth. Recognizing wounds means recognizing past traumas and taking steps towards the healing process. It refers to the individual’s selfishness of prioritizing his own needs in the process of \"being me\" as \"not being able to break away from me\". On the contrary, it refers to situations such as being unable to protect one’s own freedom and personal identity and creating one’s own happiness through the happiness and preferences of one’s partner, as \"getting lost in you\". In this context, the process of \"Being Me\" is an important journey for the individual to discover himself and become spiritually stronger and mature. When spouses who have completed this process come together, a family that is happy, healthy and knows what it wants is formed.",

      "abstract": "Only after a system of moral and ethical values has been established can viable models of judgment and decision making be designed. Such models may then be used to either prescribe how a decision should be made or describe the behavior of decision makers. This article suggests ways in which the Christian presuppositional system may affect a decision model's parameters and mathematical form in terms of (a) the utility of objects and events, (b) the relative importance of information, (c) the way in which uncertainty is resolved, and (d) the goal of the decision maker as indicated by the particular dimension selected for optimization. In each case, Christian presuppositions define the criteria used to validate the model in terms of God's absolute laws and precepts. Other presuppositional systems rely on relative criteria based on biological, psychological, or sociological dimensions. Without the absolutes of God the Father, the work of Jesus the Son, and guidance through the Holy Spirit, models of judgment and decision are arbitrary at best and incomplete or inconsistent in the main. The Christian faith reconciles our own finite value system with the ultimate criterion system — God's laws.",

Many would argue that ritual is not simply one of many modes of communication available to humans but the one that has made other sorts of human communication possible, particularly those resting on language. Although popular understanding tends to associate ritual with the concerns or practice of religion, a fundamental aspect of the definition offered here is that it does not stipulate ritual’s subject matter. Ritual is understood to be a form or structure, that is, a number of features or characteristics in a more or less fixed relationship to one another. Events conforming to this definition occur outside religious contexts. Psychiatrists, for instance, have used the terms ritual and ceremony to refer both to the pathological behavior of obsessive-compulsives and to the healthy but stereotyped interactions between parents and children. In fact, usage does not have to be confined to the human species. Ethologists use the term to designate stereotypic dis plays through which members of a very large number of species communicate with their conspecifics (for example, the courtship rituals of great-crested grebes or fiddler crabs).",

      "abstract": "Aesthetics is certainly not an easy concept to define or explain. The numerous problems often associated with identifying the aesthetic in terms of the properties of its particular objects, arts and culture, largely account for this difficulty. And so relative, open-ended and complex is aesthetics that philosophers, scholars and aestheticians, since Plato's time, are still far from reaching a definitive consensus about its properties, application and meaning. In its general application to the arts, the inherent criterial problems of aesthetics appear to be heightened and made even more complex by the fact that some works of art, like sculpture, consist of physical objects; others, like poetry and music, consist of verbal and gestural behavior and imagined and non-physical objects, even though poetry and music can at times consist of physical objects; and others still, like dance and drama, consist of kinesis and a variable combination of some or all of the other properties. Generally, it should be correct to say that aesthetics is an articulated value concept, a relative and qualitative experience that is diffused throughout nature and the arts, and throughout human experience and behavior, even though the congeries of its qualities and coordinates are often irreducible in language and analysis. Aesthetics can, therefore, apply to the “theories about the nature of art as well as about the criteria of aesthetic judgement” (Wolff 1983, 27). This argument by Janet Wolff is based on the inherent relationship between an art concept and its corresponding aesthetic theory on the one hand, and on the relationship between a preferred or “adopted” aesthetic theory and the corresponding criteria for its application and analysis:",

      "abstract": "Wu 無is one of the most prominent terms in Ancient Daoist philosophy, and perhaps the only term to appear more than Dao in both the Laozi and the Zhuangzi. However, unlike Dao, wu is generally used as an adjective modifying or describing nouns such as “names”, “desires”, “knowledge”, “action”, and so forth. Whereas Dao serves as the utmost principle in both generation and practice, wu becomes one of the central methods to achieve or emulate this ideal. As a term of negation, wu usually indicates the absence of something, as seen in its relation to the term you 有—“to have” or “presence”. From the perspective of generative processes, wu functions as an undefined and undifferentiated cosmic situation from which no beginning can begin but everything can emerge. In the political aspect, wu defines, or rather un-defines the actions (non-coercive action, wuwei無為) that the utmost authority exerts to allow the utmost simplicity and “authenticity” (the zi自constructions) of the people. In this paper, I suggest an understanding of wu as a philosophical framework that places Pre-Qin Daoist thought as a system that both promotes our understanding of the way the world works and offers solutions to particular problems. Wu then is simultaneously metaphysical and concrete, general, and particular. It is what allows the world, the society, and the person to flourish on their own terms.",

      "title": "The Norse Concept of Luck",
      "abstract": "THE FICKLENESS OF LUCK is a standing motif in our culture. For many, is defined by unpredictability more than anything else. In Norse culture, the case is quite the opposite in that had nothing to do with what we would refer to as coincidence or chance. On the contrary, was a quality inherent in the and his lineage, a part of his personality similar to his strength, intelligence, or skill with weapons, at once both the cause and the expression of the success, wealth, and power of a family. Luck expressed itself partially in skills, beauty, and other desirable characteristics, but also in events shaping themselves according to the wishes of the lucky man. One might have in specified areas but not in others, such as fishingluck or weatherluck for example. But the so-called man of was the who possessed generally, not just in one specific area. People possessed in different measure and one was helpless against an opponent who had greater luck. Kings especially were great men of to the degree that they were able to send forth their to assist others. Luck was not a thing to be sought or found by coincidence; one had the that one was accorded by fate. Yet, in certain cases could be diminished or lost, a phenomenon on which I shall elaborate later. As to the more specific details of how the notion of was perceived, not much is known, and scholarship on the topic has been relatively limited. I find that the view of as part of a man's inherent nature sets the Norse concept of uniquely apart from a more modern conception, and it is this aspect of that I will investigate in this article. More specifically, I shall attempt to elucidate an aspect of that has only been touched upon by a few scholars and not for many decades: the view of Norse society on and the lack of it. I find that the concept of has certain implications for society's view of the luck-man and his counterpart, the luckless man. If is one of a man's personal qualities, it may possibly affect the judgment of his character. Luck may be considered not as a morally neutral factor as in modern Western society, but a requisite part of an ideal personality. Certain Norse texts seem to imply a degree of moral condemnation of the luckless man, and it is this aspect of luck--society's view of the lucky and unlucky man--that I will investigate. Was an essential and required part of the personality of the ideal or heroic male? Was the luckless correspondingly considered morally impaired? Was there an element of condemnation attached to lucklessness? The conception designated in modern English by the word luck is highly complex. This fact is reflected in the Norse terminology used to describe the various ideas of luck. The main terms are as follows: gipta, gofa, heill, fylgja, and hamingja. The words audna, sola, and hugr are also used in connection with but are less important to the central questions of this article. The meaning of these terms ranges from the abstract luck-quality, inherent in a man, which he may send forth for the assistance of someone else to a goddess of a certain family; a diversity that witnesses the complexity of the concept of luck. RESEARCH HISTORY The various terms for figure so frequently and widely in Norse literature--predominantly in sagas--that there is no reason to doubt that played an important role in the culture. The question is whether we may consider our sources, which are texts written in a Christian age, to be reliable sources of pre-Christian Norse thought and religion. In this case, one may conclude that the concept at least to some degree accurately reflects a pre-Christian mode of thought since large parts of its content and use clearly do not correspond to Christian ideas and thus cannot derive from them. Though the idea of guardian spirits might be borrowed from Christianity, the idea of as a force emanating from a person could hardly be. …",

      "abstract": "The conversational background to our lives is strange in that we cannot turn it around into an object of thought, to be explained like all else in our world in terms of either rules, theories or models. Its strangeness, it is argued, arises out of the fact that all actions by human beings involved with others in a social group are, as Bakhtin (1986, 1990) claims, dialogically or responsively linked in some way, both to previous, already executed actions, and to anticipated, next possible actions. Or, as Searle (1992) has argued: all utterances within conversations are necessarily related to each other, internally; they have shared intentionality. Within situations with shared intentionality, it is as if the situation itself is an ethically active, living entity that, as much as the others around us, requires our respect. Thus, like the others around us, `it' also can exert a formative influence upon what we do within it. Some of the consequences of this extraordinary circumstance for psychology are explored in the article.",

      "abstract": "Like human beings social organizations and institutions are mortal. The duration of their existence seems to be finite. At one time-moment an organization emerges as a separate and recognizable collective unity and begins to function as an individuality among thousands of other organizations and institutions. This functioning may be shorter or longer. Sometimes it is so short that the organi­ zation dies at its „pre-natal stage” before it emerges. Sometimes the organization lives for a certain length of time, and then, either sud­ denly or gradually, losing its essential traits, it begins to disintegrate, and becomes more and more unidentifiable, until finally, like a wave which exists for some time and then disappears in the midst of other waves, it dissolves in the ocean of other organizations and institutions. The beginning and the end of some organizations and institutions is clearly marked and can be established definitely in the terms of a year, a month, sometimes even a day or an hour. Such are for instance most of the organizations whose beginning and end are determined by juridical incorporation and dissolution. Other organizations and insti­ tutions, like many States, Religious Organizations, Educational Insti­ tutions, sometimes Family, and so on, often do not have such definite marks of their emergence and end, either because they are not record­ ed and are lost in the grey past, or because they have grown and dissolved, gradually and imperceptibly. In such organizations the life-span either cannot be established at all or can be determined only very approximately, liable to a considerable error. From the standpoint of theory and practice a more exact know­ ledge of what is the average life-span of various social organizations",

      "abstract": "Abstract If we have suffered or expect to suffer some wilful injury from a man, or if he is in any way offensive to us, we dislike him; and dislike easily rises into hatred. Such feelings, if experienced in a moderate degree, are not clearly expressed by any movement of the body or features, excepting perhaps by a certain gravity of behaviour, or by some ill-temper. Few individuals, however, can long reflect about a hated person, without feeling and exhibiting signs of indignation or rage. But if the offending person be quite insignificant, we experience merely disdain or contempt. If, on the other hand, he is all-powerful, then hatred passes into terror, as when a slave thinks about a cruel master, or a savage about a bloodthirsty malignant deity. Most of our emotions are so closely connected with their expression, that they hardly exist if the body remains passive – the nature of the expression depending in chief part on the nature of the actions which have been habitually performed under this particular state of the mind. A man, for instance, may know that his life is in the extremest peril, and may strongly desire to save it, yet may exclaim as did Louis XVI, when surrounded by a fierce mob, ‘Am I afraid? feel my pulse.’ So a man may intensely hate another, hut until his bodily frame is affected he cannot be said to be enraged.",

      "title": "A Gift of Life: Ethical and Practical Problems With Conditional and Directed Donation",
      "abstract": "The idea of removing organs from the dead and transplanting them into the living is disturbing to some people, and leads to concerns about commodification of the human body (1). Our society has come to terms with this practice partly by viewing organ donation as a gift (2), thus emphasizing the importance of donor autonomy. The series of cases presented here highlight two main questions about this autonomy (1). How do we ascertain donors' wishes, and (2) should these wishes be carried out under all circumstances? When donors or their families request that the organs only go to a specific person or group of people, conflicts can develop between the principle of donor autonomy and the principles of justice and equality. This article will address the distinctions between “Directed” and “Conditional Donation,” and attempt to delineate the circumstances in which they may be morally acceptable. We will also discuss the issue of priority in transplantation for those who are willing to donate themselves. First, how do we ascertain donors' wishes? Since this is impossible at the time of donation, we must rely on surrogate measures such as organ donor cards and the next of kin. For practical reasons the family's wishes tend to predominate, as highlighted in case 3. A 19-year-old female had signed a donor card indicating she would donate all of her organs, but her family was only willing to allow donation of her liver and kidneys. Is her family faithfully representing her wishes? It is impossible to be certain, but we must give them the benefit of the doubt. Legally, the family is authorized to act as surrogate decision-makers for their daughter. Ethically, it would be suspect for a physician or government official to presume they know the 19-year old's wishes better than the family. This is especially true when all we have to go on is a boilerplate statement not directly composed by the donor. Case 6 raises similar issues. These cases are good examples of why a donor registry where people are presumed to be donors unless they “opt out” would not necessarily increase rates of donation, because the final decision is made by the family anyhow (3). Second, should the donor's wishes be fulfilled in all circumstances? This is a more difficult question, and will be the focus of the next four paragraphs. We will begin with circumstances in which heeding the donor's wishes would clearly be wrong. In case 2, the family of a 30-year-old man stipulates that his organs can only be transplanted in a white person. This represents Conditional Donation, which is agreeing to donate only under certain conditions. In this particular case, nobody was directly harmed since the first patients on the list were white anyhow. Furthermore, refusing the offer would mean fewer available organs and potentially more deaths. For this reason some have argued that while the offer was morally wrong, accepting it was not (4). All's well that ends well? When lives are at stake, it is tempting to focus only on outcomes, and to view justice and equality as unaffordable luxuries. However, accepting such a racially based donation requirement violates many fundamental principles of justice and equality. It violates some principles of justice purely on moral grounds—discriminating against a group of people based on morally irrelevant characteristics, failing to give all people equal opportunity, and furthering hardship to a group of people who are already treated harshly by society. It also violates consequentialist principles of justice—principles that evaluate the appropriateness of allocation criteria based on the likely outcomes of applying those criteria. There is empirical evidence that allowing this type of conditional donation to occur would reduce other people's willingness to donate their loved one's organs, or to support funding for organ transplantation (5). Conditional Donation is not morally acceptable in this case, and the majority of the public would not support it (6). Are there situations in which Conditional Donation is acceptable? This leads us to case 5. In case 5, the family of a 63-year-old woman agrees to donate her organs on the condition that they not be transplanted into alcoholic patients. While these conditions seem to enjoy strong public support, we must be careful to avoid the tyranny of the majority. There are two objections to liver transplantation for patients with alcoholic liver disease: prognosis and personal responsibility for illness. Because patients with alcoholic liver disease are carefully selected to minimize recidivism, posttransplant outcomes are excellent (7). This satisfies the principle of utilitarianism, or maximizing the benefit of transplantation across the population. This is very different from allocating organs based on responsibility for illness. Studies have shown that the general public wants to punish people who have undesirable habits, regardless of whether those habits actually caused the disease (8). This fact makes allocating by socially undesirable habits seem very similar to allocating by other socially undesirable traits such as sexual orientation. Furthermore, the pervasive myth that substance abuse is entirely under a person's control ignores the biological facts of addiction. Few people are not guilty of damaging their health in some fashion. Remember those extra cookies last night? The role of the liver transplant system is to benefit all patients as much as possible, not to act as judge and jury for past sins. Once again, Conditional Donation does not stand up to close scrutiny. While these cases suggest that so far that Conditional Donation may not be acceptable, what about Directed Donation? In case 4, a 14-year-old boy had been touched by the television story of a 3-year-old girl in need of a liver transplant. When the boy was in an accident, his parents agree to donate his organs but ask that his liver go to the 3-year-old girl if possible. This is a case of Directed Donation to a specific person. It is clear that the parents are faithfully representing their son's wishes, so the principle of autonomy is satisfied. This case exemplifies organ donation as a gift, because neither the 14-year old nor the son expect anything concrete in return. While the principle of equity may be violated because this 3-year old jumps the queue, some would argue that it is a “random” violation of equity rather than one targeted at a disadvantaged group such as in case 2. However, we must point out that not all families have the financial means to advertise on television. Allowing this to occur would open the door for the socioeconomically advantaged to use their wealth and power to obtain a transplant sooner. There are already concerns about this happening with live donation, such as the case of the Tennessee man who reportedly sold his kidney on matchingdonors.com (9). Fortunately, case 4 has a happy ending—when the transplant coordinator explains that many children are in need of a liver transplant, the family agrees to donate with the understanding that children receive first priority. This is not conditional or directed donation, but rather allocation policy that is strongly supported by ethical theory and public opinion (10). Case 4 ended happily, but there will be other cases in which a prohibition against Directed Donation would lead to potential donors refusing to donate. Public surveys indicate that 21% of Americans would donate their organs only if they could choose the intended recipient (6). Are we willing to accept 21% fewer organs to satisfy principles of equity and socioeconomic equality? We suggest that these 21% of people may have been thinking of their loved ones when expressing these views. Ethicists and evolutionary biologists have argued for years that we have special obligations to people with whom we have a relationship (11). One example of this is in case 1, where a 21-year-old potential donor happens to have a father on the waiting list for a kidney transplant. There is no doubt that the son would choose to have his kidney go to his father. In this case, we contend that the special obligation to a loved one outweighs concerns about fairness and waiting times. Allowing people to direct their donations to loved ones would also satisfy the principle of utilitarianism by increasing the number of donations. It is even possible that the other patients on the waiting list would accept and approve of being bypassed if there were a special relationship between the donor and recipient. Thus, Directed Donation may be acceptable if there is a preexisting relationship between the donor and recipient. Although is undoubtedly not a common occurrence, a well-advertised policy such as this may increase organ donation rates by improving public views on fairness of the organ allocation system. Questions of directed and conditional donation are part of a larger issue, which is increasing the rates of donation by the use of incentives. These incentives can be monetary, the right to choose who gets the organ, or extra priority if those who are willing to donate themselves become in need of a transplant. In case 1, the father of the 21-year-old man later realizes that organ donation is not consistent with his religion, and rescinds his consent for his son to donate. The father then removes himself from the transplant list, feeling that if he is not willing to donate then he shouldn't receive a transplant. From a theoretical standpoint, the idea that “only those who are willing to give should receive” has merit. This precept satisfies Rawlsian principles of justice (12), reciprocal altruism, and also utilitarianism if the number of organ donations were to increase because of enlightened self-interest. Some authors have proposed a national registry of organ donors, who would themselves receive priority for organs if they need one (13). However, in most situations (unlike case 1, which is unusual) this idea is difficult to operationalize. These proposals ignore who actually makes the final decision to donate—the donor's family. How could the promise of future access to transplantation provide any incentive when a person is already brain dead? There is empiric evidence from the economics literature that such registries may perversely induce a decline in the number of organs donated, by removing the benefits of “pure” altruism from the decision-making process (14). Finally, there is the issue of time inconsistency. Imagine a person who initially refuses to be a donor, but later in life becomes ill and needs a transplant. This person realizes he or she was wrong to refuse donation, and would now agree to donate if this were possible. Certainly, this person is guilty of a lack of sympathy for others earlier in life, but is this such an egregious crime to warrant banishment from the transplant list? Most physicians would feel uncomfortable refusing a transplant for such a patient. To do so would violate “the rule of rescue,” or the moral imperative to help those in most need. To summarize, while autonomy forms the basis for social acceptability of organ donation, there are many situations in which other ethical considerations should be dominant. We define Conditional Donation as agreeing to donate only if the organs go to a certain group of people. This is different from Directed Donation, which is agreeing to donate but requesting that the organ go to a specific person if possible. There are three distinctions that are potentially ethically relevant. One distinction is between groups and individuals. It is common in our culture to give gifts directed at individuals, whereas gifts directed at certain groups lead to concerns about exclusion of others. While our society may decide to give priority to certain groups such as children, this is a matter of allocation policy and will occur whether the donor requests it or not. Another distinction is between conditional and unconditional donation—if organ donation is truly a gift then it should not be contingent on certain conditions. This distinction has moral weight, but in practice the recipient is usually identified before organ procurement. If the family of a potential donor rescinds their offer on finding out that the intended recipient cannot receive the organ because of histocompatibility issues, it would be morally and legally difficult to go against their wishes. The final distinction is between obligations to strangers versus loved ones. For the entire history of humankind, relationships have formed the basis for much of human behavior and the structure of society. As we discussed in case 1, some ethicists argue that obligations to loved ones hold moral weight (15). In the setting of directed organ donation, a preexisting relationship with the intended recipient may over-ride concerns about equity and obviate concerns about discrimination based on race or religion. This distinction may also help explain why directed living donation is widely accepted but directed deceased donation is still controversial, because it is rare for potential donors to have loved ones on the transplant waiting list. In conclusion, we contend that Conditional Donation is not morally acceptable, and that Directed Donation is acceptable only when the donor and recipient have had a preexisting relationship. Finally, we believe that the idea of priority for those willing to donate themselves has merit on ethical grounds, but will not work for the practical reasons discussed above.",

      "abstract": "Abstract In New Comedy, a bride is presumed to be a virgin at the time of marriage (or, more accurately, at the time of her first marriage); if she has been violated, it is by the man who is destined to become her husband. A courtesan, on the contrary, has relations with several men, and this renders her ineligible as a conjugal partner. For the courtesan, more¬ over, love is a business, and whatever the romantic feelings that may occasionally be attributed to her, her relationships with men are in the first instance commercial. This is the basis for the common characterization of the hetaera as greedy. Marriage stands outside such mercantile transactions. Far from being acquisitive, the marriageable woman seems almost to be devoid of motives altogether. She is the object of another’s desire, and it is she who is transferred from one party to another in the conjugal transaction. The courtesan engages as an agent in the sphere of economic circulation, selling the use of herself to a purchaser, while the bride is passively given, along with a dowry, by her father or nearest male relative to the authority of her husband.",

      "title": "DEVELOPMENTAL TRENDS IN THE ABSTRACTION ABILITY OF CHILDREN1",
      "abstract": "ion is mental process in which some attribute or characteristic is observed independently of other characteristics of an experience as a whole. Werner (26) emphasizes that the ability to abstract does not appear suddenly in the course of the individual's development; rather it is present from the very beginnings of life but changes qualitatively with progress in maturation. Different organizational patterns of response to environmental stimuli are observed in children of varying age levels (26). The abstraction behavior of very young children seems to be primarily on a sensori-motor level and can be designated as perceptual. In such a response the individual yields to demands of the situation, and the organization of the material is determined by the nature of the stimuli as well as by the limited maturity of the subject. A more mature individual would be expected to consciously impose organi- zation on the material (i, 7, 14, 17, 19, 26) and classify the material into deliberately conceived categories. This is the conceptual level of abstraction. The hypothesis that the younger the child, the more perceptual are his organizations has been stated (i, 7, 14, 26) but a search for specific details of the development encounters a paucity of data. The present study was undertaken to obtain information regarding changes in abstraction abil- ity during the elementary school period.",

      "title": "MANUSIA YANG DICINTAI DAN DIBENCI ALLAH DALAM AL-QURˈĀN",
      "abstract": "Manusia makhluk paling sempurna sifatnya, paling kuat jiwanya, paling baik akhlaknya. Manusia juga dibekali Tuhan akal pikiran untuk mempertahankan hidupnya dari segala macam rintangan dan cobaan. Akal pikiran inilah yang membedakan manusia berpikir, berbuat, berencana, menurut logika itulah manusia mampu menciptakan ilmu pengetahuan modern. Dengan akal pikiran manusia dapat membedakan yang baik dan yang buruk tentang segala tindakan yang akan dilakukannya. Perilaku manusia sangat dipengaruhi oleh cara berpikir mereka terhadap apa yang sedang mereka hadapi. Didalam Al-Qur’an sebagian manusia ada yang dicintai dan dibenci oleh Allah swt.\r\nMemperhatikan suasana kini, sebagian umat Islam hidup rukun dan damai dan sebagian yang lain hidup terzalimi, dan banyak di antara tetangga-tetangganya yang kurang memperhatikan. Demikian pula sebagian lain terpecah-pecah, kurang terdorong untuk bersatu ataupun memantapkan di lingkungan mereka. Adapula sebagian lagi yang sering mengkritisi, mencaci, ataupun melakukan tindakan-tindakan tidak terpuji. Semua keyakinan, ucapan, ataupun amalan yang diperintahkan oleh Allah dan Rasul-Nya, baik yang sifatnya wajib maupun sunnah, semuanya dicintai dan diridhai oleh Allah. Sebaliknya, semua keyakinan, ucapan ataupun amalan yang dilarang dan bertentangan dengan syari’at, maka itu semuanya dibenci Allah swt.\r\nPenelitian ini bersifat kepustakaan yang didasarkan pada Al-Qurˈān sebagai sumber primer dan buku-buku lainnya yang terkait dengan tema ini sebagai sumber data sekunder. Adapun data-data yang dibutuhkan dalam penyelesaian penelitian ini diperoleh dengan menggunakan teknik dokumentasi yaitu menghimpun literatur-literatur yang berkaitan dengan objek penelitian penulis yaitu tentang orang-orang yang dicintai dan dibenci oleh Allah swt. Sementara metode yang digunakan untuk mengolah data dalam penelitian ini adalah dengan menggunakan metode tematik. yaitu mengelompokkan ayat sesuai dengan turunnya ayat Al-Qur’an, menggunakan asbāb al-nuzūl, mengelompokkan ayat-ayat yang telah ditemukan berdasarkan Makkiyah dan Madaniyah, dan menggunakan kitab-kitab tafsir untuk memperjelas kajiannya.\r\nDari penelitian ini ditemukan informasi, bahwa ada 35 ayat Al-Qur’an yang menyebutkan siapa saja yang Allah sukai dari hamba-hambanya yang beriman. Di antara orang-orang yang dicintai Allah ialah yaitu orang-orang yang berbuat baik, orang-orang yang bertobat dan menyucikan diri, orang-orang yang berbuat kebajikan, orang-orang yang adil, orang-orang yang bertawakkal, orang-orang yang bertakwa, orang-orang yang sabar, dan orang-orang yang beriman. Adapun konsekuensi orang-orang yang dicintai Allah yaitu akan mendapat pahala dan ganjaran di akhirat tidak lain adalah surga. Dan Ada 27 ayat dalam Al-Qur’an yang menyebutkan siapa saja orang-orang yang dibenci oleh Allah antara lain yaitu: orang-orang yang melampaui batas, orang-orang kafir, orang-orang zalim, orang-orang sombong dan membanggakan diri, orang-orang yang berkhianat, orang-orang yang membuat kerusakan, dan orang-orang yang berlebih-lebihan. Adapun konsekuensi orang-orang yang dibenci Allah yaitu akan diberikan siksaan yang sangat pedih dan akan dimasukkan ke dalam neraka.",

      "title": "Chapter 8. Senses’ Other Sides",
      "abstract": "SENSES' OTHER SIDESan initiaL pair of propositions: senses work in language, but are not original to, dependent on, or servile to it; and on account of that nonlinguistic basis of senses, many entities, maybe all, but at least far beyond language's reach, sense their worlds. 1Such propositions are simply that: possibly or even just intuitions or inferences; that is to say, they engage philosophical and ethical questions, at best, and become intellectual passatempo, at worst.Naturally, I want to argue for the former, because on the one hand, our own resources for understanding relations among entities in late antiquity and Byzantium are so incomplete and inarticulated that engagement with how we relate to and judge our own worlds is crucial.Patchwork, piecemeal, puzzling is our approach to the consistency of sense lives across living things, both in beings we easily assume have feelings (ourselves, animals) and those we assume do not (inert materials such as metals, for example).And so on the other hand, confronting our assumptions about life and our responsibilities can arise from historical investigations and determine both our attitudes toward the past and toward our common present.For these reasons, a highly provisional exercise that stretches the historical imagination and accords sense lives to others can be mutually beneficial. 2 My specific attention in this chapter is directed at the viscous in Byzantium.By that I mean (mostly, but not only) the molten: the state that wax, metal, glass, stone, and simi lar, can achieve when heat is applied to it, a state that can bridge the liquid and heated and that can also be the process in which fusion of otherwise separate materials can take place.The state between solid and liquid is always in process; almost no substance stays viscous.Something is always on the way to something else when in a state of viscos ity.In that mobile passage between states, essences are declared, as in alchemy's belief in the process of purification toward gold when some materials are melted and fused with others.One could take a lead on viscosity from a Christology of matter, because all matter can; for Christ's own blood, flowing and turning to gore, is the most significant precedent of all for Christian thinking on matter's sliding states and their holy mimesis. 3Mimesis is a deep need for humans and for all other entities. 4",

      "abstract": "The failure of Transactional and Associative theories to explain the source of a general duty to obey domestic law pushes us to explore other possibilities. In particular, since the moral duty to obey seems to many a relatively basic, natural, nonvoluntary feature of social life, it seems initially promising to suppose that the moral principle that accounts for this duty belongs to that group of principles that specifies our natural moral duties. Natural Duty theories of the duty to obey the law, as we have seen, are those that ground our duty to obey not in who we are (as in Associative accounts) or in what we've done or enjoyed (as in Transactional accounts), but rather either (a) in the moral importance of advancing some impartial moral good or (b) in some moral duty thought to be owed by all persons to all others as moral equals, regardless of roles, relationships, or transactions. Thus, the natural duty in question, from which the duty to obey is to be derived, could be a consequentialist moral duty to promote or maximize the occurrence of some good property or state of affairs – such as happiness (utility, preference satisfaction, etc.), moral perfection, or justice.",

      "title": "De(Re)Constructing Narratives in Intellectual Property Law: Transformative Play, Culture Jamming, and Poststructural Disruptions",
      "abstract": "In his critique of consumption, Jean Baudrillard contends that the consumer no longer relates to a particular object in its specific utility, but to a set of objects in its total signification. Thus, increasingly, when consumers make their purchases, they do not simply select goods and services purely for their functional or utilitarian values, but are buying into the significations of these commodities in the construction of their self-identities. Objects of intellectual property (IP), in particular copyrighted works, trademarks and the celebrity personality, represent far more than a bundle of legal rights. They are invariably associated with a set of cultural narratives and semiotic meanings which are ultimately consumed. A well-known literary or artistic work does much more than simply educate, inform or entertain; it also functions as a signifier of a set of signified meanings. A trademark does not only designate the source or origin of goods. Famous brands like Louis Vuitton, Apple and Nike possess particular configurations of meanings that offer peculiarly powerful affirmations of belonging and recognition in the lives of their customers worldwide. Celebrities, whose identities may be protected against commercial appropriation by the right of publicity, have become common points of reference for millions of individuals who may never interact with one another, but who have, by virtue of their participation in a mediated culture, a shared experience and a collective memory. This essay explores how the encoded narratives in certain objects of IP may be read as polysemous texts that invite playful semiotic recodings, culture jamming and poststructural disruptions. It also suggests how audiences who engage with works of copyright, trademarks and celebrities via such textual signification may avail themselves of a number of legal defences under the current legal regime.",

      "abstract": "Anger is defined as \"the state of emotion experienced as a result of the inability of the individual to express himself in a positive way in the face of the prevention of wishes, needs and plans and injustices\".Anger according to Soykan 2 it is a very natural, universal and human emotional response to unsaturated desires, unintended consequences and unmet expectations.Anger is a normal and anticipated human experience, just like other emotions; he is not an enemy.Anger; Usually, he tells people that something that matters to them is somehow threatened or that their desire to achieve a specific purpose is blocked.It also has a positive structure such as triggering stability and tenacity. 2When we get angry, there are some changes in our bodies.These are; Increases muscle tension, cracking eyebrows, squeaking the teeth, squeaking the teeth, tightening the blades, changing the shape of the arms and body, flushing gasoline (losing color), heart palpitations, tremors, sleep, clogging, twitching, sweating, loss of control, feeling warm, indigestion, feeling cold. 3Anger is an extremely healthy and natural feeling when expressed appropriately.However, if it spirals out of control and becomes destructive, it causes problems in school-business life, personal relationships and overall quality of life (Kokdemir, 2004).The expression of these feelings is learned by imitating parents and other adults in the family through the situations and events that create a sense of anger and resentment in childhood.Anger and resentment are not positive behavior in any situation, again the effect of family and close environment is brought to the child and adolescent.Expressing anger and anger in words is a form of behavior observed from an early age.The language used to express anger contains angry, angry, high-toned words, profanity or sarcastic and sarcastic expressions. 4At the moment of anger, the mouth part shows the desire to head towards the person who is angry, and with the intensity of anger, the jaw extends forward.The reaction of the mouth during the sense of anger, especially the fact that the jaw goes back 1-2 seconds forward can be a precursor to the person becoming aggressive. 5Aggression, which is one of the ways in which anger and anger are expressed; it occurs in the form of swipe, kicking and punching, pushing, shaking, biting, pinching, using hands, arms, legs and other organs of the body, or using a stick or similar vehicle to damage it. 4The emergence of violent behaviour in schools remains an acceptable problem between students and school staff. 6The child, who is incapable of anger control in the school environment, faces many problems.Schools are also an important element in recognizing a sense of anger and gaining the ability to express it in a healthy",

      "title": "XL. More about the Vocabulary of Psychology",
      "abstract": "In the English language there ate several synonyms that have come into use for the way people feel as a result of activity or even on the contemplation of activity. They are, for example, fatigue, tiredness, weariness, exhaustion, jadedness, droopiness, and the state of being fagged or flagged. In all of these words a state is being referred to. And, of course, there are the adverbial and adjectival and verbal forms of these words when process is being expressed. When processes are referred to, they generally pertain to processes of restricted parts of the body so that we can say they are subpersonalistic. Customarily, the word psychological is the term used to describe behavior of the organism-as-a-whole. Here again, by some, reference is only to what is experienced and according to custom is also called mental. It would seem that in cases where the term psycl-rological is customarily used, a preferable term would be personalistic. This would include both the mental and the overr. This usage would provide a less biased taxonomy (or classification) of matters to be dealt wich. Body process as such would be srrbpersonalistic. If appropriate vocabularies were set up for the various items of concern, then no one need be confused regarding the class under discussion-the context is certain and one knows which is genus and which is species. This policy has never been consistently carried out, and it is undeniable that confusion or inconsistency reigns. The purpose of the present introductory remarks is two-fold: (a) to introduce the subject of fatigue and (b) in so doing avoid perpetuating the deficiencies just pointed out. For some reason, our of all these words, the noun, fatigue has come to be the most generic, including even the nonbiological systems and substances outside the body. Since the word fatigue was first used to describe the human condition, it would seem reasonable that psychology, the discipline which defines itself as the science of the behavior of humans, would restrict the term fatigue to describing the state of the human organism as a person, rather than to describing the function or condition of parts of it as such. Unfortunately, this policy has not been followed. All this means that a great deal of variance exists in what is actually meant when the word fatigue is used. Some workers in the area have called for a clarification, supposing that some agreement in terminology on a rational basis could eventuate. Surely it is nor too much to expect this, because the optimal progress of human understanding in general and in science in particular is dependent upon the adoption of clear means of verbal communication. A revision and sharpening of vocabulary would not restrict research nor build science in some partisan way. Bartley and Chute (1947) have suggested that the term fatigue be used to label the class of phenomena that we call human feelings and self-evaluations.",

At the same time, many traditions have believed the fruits of contemplative practice to come about spontaneously, rather than as a result of deliberate effort, and they have treated certain aspects of spontaneous thought as helping the process forward. Various traditions have recommended different approaches to spontaneous thought, including active suppression, mindful observation, harmonious regulation, reluctant or wholehearted acceptance, and either gently or forcefully turning one’s attention to the object of meditation or prayer. Specific antidotes have included the recital of sacred texts or mantras, as well as the performance of good deeds, ascetic exercises, or rituals of repentance and confession.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Individuals avoid objects that have been in physical contact with morally offensive or disgusting entities. This has been called negative magical contagion, an implicit belief in the transmission of essence by physical contact. Alternatively, individuals may avoid a negatively contaminated object because: 1) the object is a strong reminder of the original contagion source (association account); or 2) the act of interacting with the object signals specific information about the self (social communication account). We report that: 1) people often prefer to interact with an entity that they believe is more associated with a negative source rather than an entity that is less associated but has made physical contact with the same negative source; 2) while an associative account requires that contact enhances association, a study of memory for visual pairings of objects indicates that when objects are touching, their associative link (recall) is no greater than when they are in proximity; and 3) subjects continue to show aversion to (prefer to wear gloves to handle) an object that contacted a negative entity even if they are handling the object in order to physically destroy it, hence strongly signaling their rejection of that object. Association and social communication are at best partial accounts for contagion effects.",

By “importance” I do not just mean basic survival value, for although we can survive without sight and hearing, and (perhaps with more difficulty) touch, our full engagement with the complex social and cultural world so vital to human flourishing depends on the pre-eminence of these senses. In contrast, although our senses of smell and taste can bring us pleasure, and in certain cases alert us to potential dangers, they can seem much less vital to our existence and well-being, and the pleasures they provide of far less interest and consequence than the objects we contemplate in sight and sound. Hence the scepticism frequently directed, for example, at claims that there can be objective standards of taste, or that food and drink can be genuine or serious objects of aesthetic interest, claims that we shall examine in some detail later.",

      "abstract": "There are well established criteria for what constitutes a homicide and under what conditions it is permissible. Since suicide is etymologically and semantically similar to homicide, I argue that deploying the structure of a homicide taxonomy to classify and characterise suicides arrives at a more robust understanding of suicide than alternatives, one that is intuitively plausible, and has the pragmatic quality that it is compatible with clinical assessments of suicide and suicidal behaviour. I show that while suicide may not be the moral equivalent of killing another person, types of suicide can be differentiated according to the same criteria as homicides: intention, mental capacity, diminished responsibility, and foreseeability. Suicides can then be subclassified similarly to homicides according to type: self-murder, justifiable self-manslaughter, voluntary self-manslaughter, involuntary self-manslaughter, and accidental suicide. Some suicides have elements of both homicide and suicide, such as when someone contributes to or encourages a person’s suicide, or when someone kills others when she kills herself, such as a suicide bomber. My view entails that deaths caused by a sublimated death-wish may be a type of suicide, and someone’s behaviour may be suicidal by a matter of degree. \r\n\r\nTo determine whether an act of suicide is wrong, we must consider the sorts of reasons that people have to kill themselves. I argue that even if we consider that human beings have intrinsic value, it does not follow that all suicides are wrong. On Kant’s view, the maxims that underlie actions, rather than the actions themselves, are fundamental to moral assessment. I show that Kant’s overall moral framework supports subcategorising suicides similarly to homicides. I apply Kant’s distinction between duties to selves and duties to others to show that agents’ obligations pertaining to suicide are only weakly symmetrical to their obligations pertaining to homicide. Kant indicates that duties to oneself and duties to others are not exactly equivalent. We have a duty to respect others’ autonomy, and this means that we do not act upon them as we might do to ourselves, and duties to oneself are not enforceable where duties to others may be. Kant’s position supports the idea that even if a given suicide is wrong, others may not be permitted to forcibly prevent it, and that is not the case with some weakly symmetrical homicides. \r\n\r\nEven if we accept that suicide sometimes honours one’s intrinsic value, this may not give adequate weight to the impact that suicide has on others. I argue that role-related special obligations, such as those that parents have towards their children, have contractual elements that preclude permissible suicide. If someone has a role-related obligation to provide continuing care and support, then normally there are strong moral reasons against that person committing suicide. This understands roles as having normative parameters that consist of contractual, voluntarily acquired special obligations. I deploy the conceptual framework of contracts to provide guidance on cases of suicide with respect to role responsibilities. I propose that as we have established criteria for morally acceptable reasons for cancelling, voiding, or amending a contract, we can apply these to the roles to establish grounds for releasing a parent from his role-related and contractual obligations. A parent who is terminally ill, for example, or has other legally and morally compelling reasons for failing to fulfil her role-related contractual obligations, may permissibly kill herself, though she may nonetheless have obligations to her child to find another suitable parent. I argue that the factors that determine culpability for homicides are also relevant for establishing culpability in contractual role-related obligations.\r\n\r\nI argue that the conceptual framework of contracts also provides a moral basis for honouring advance decisions to refuse life-saving medical treatment, where a decision pertaining to one’s eventual death as a self-killing takes place over a significant time. This is so, even though metaphysically the moral distinction between killing oneself and killing another person, including a future self, may sometimes break down. I argue that in suicide the agent who kills must be the same agent who dies, or it is not a self-killing at all, but rather a homicide. Nevertheless, we have social and pragmatic reasons for ascribing persisting ‘personal identity,’ and for regarding a psychologically discontinuous self as the same ‘person’ who issued the advance decision, despite metaphysical complications. \r\n\r\nThe symmetry between homicides and suicides shows that there can be very good reasons for suicide, such as to defend others, or because we value what makes ourselves distinctive and our lives meaningful. Even when suicide is not permissible, it is often not blameworthy, given the extenuating circumstances underlying an agent’s suicide. While classifying suicides may not give comfort to loved ones any more than classifying a homicide as vehicular manslaughter would, it does show that there are many types of suicide, and not all suicides are selfish, senseless, or shameful.",

      "title": "Ruminations on Ricoeur’s Dealings with the Self",
      "abstract": "If there is one fact about the Self, it is multifarious and diverse. Paul Ricoeur has dab-bled with the notion almost all his entire academic life. And it seems the understanding of it increases. On one hand the self is fallible - it is limited, apparently singled out as a cause of demise for the person. And yet the Self is also the pinnacle of one’s person-hood, almost a “savior-like” anthem within the person. Again, the notions seem much varied.&#x0D; And yet the Self is crucial to personhood. Ricoeur mentions that the “who” of the per-son is an aspect that the self can explain. And from this one can only imagine how the significant “other” can be just as important as the Self. The person does not move merely by instinct nor impulse; rationality stirs the Self towards liberation from bondage and ignorance. Yet it starts with the Self.&#x0D; Now what does that Self do? To put it succinctly, it is a rather an active participant in a person’s daily life. It is not entirely stagnant nor too active. It seeks docility in order to arrive at the question: Who am I? Indeed, who is the human person? Richer attempts to understand that each person has unity in heterogeneity. That is, within the individual are biological, social, physical, metal and we even daresay, spiritual aspects. The same person is not limited to one or the other, rather, s/he is all.&#x0D; Finally, the person is enmeshed in ethics. He or she is an individual who aspires for something more for the Self. It is how the person interacts and lives with the other, in harmony and justice. And each story, each narrative is an awakening, or even an illumination which contributes to its perfection. Following Ricoeur’s mind: How far has the Self gone? Indeed, almost limitless!&#x0D; References&#x0D; Itao, Alexis Deodato S. “Paul Ricoeur’s Hermeneutics of Symbols: A Critical Dialecticof Suspicion and Faith” in Kritike, Vol. 4, No. 2 Dec. 2010&#x0D; Ricoeur, Paul.

      "abstract": "Noise is a sound which is unwanted, either because of its effect on humans, its effect on fatigue or multifunctions of physical equipment, or its interference with the perception or detection of other sounds. It is a part of environmental pollution which can, in certain circumstances, reach worrying levels for the population (130 dB cause pain). Unsuitable exposure to noise for even short periods of time is responsible for symptomology involving the hearing organs (hypoacusis) and other parts of the body such as the cardiovascular, muscular and digestive systems via the connection between the central and the autonomous nervous systems. Noise in communal eating areas can be classed as coming from 3 sources: 1) operation of cooking machinery; 2) banging of pans and equipment; 3) voices of both staff and diners. The intensity of noise on these premises varies generally between 60 and 80 dB (discomfort threshold). The Regulations governing this subject are D.Lgs n.277 of 15/8/1991 regarding the protection of employees, D.P.C.M. of 1/3/1991 which establishes the maximum levels of noise both in the home and outside, and the more recent D.P.C.M. of 21/5/1999 referring to noise in public places, which includes restaurants. To contain the exposure to noise in public eating places, we believe that action should be taken at legal levels with stricter limits than the recently passed level of 105 dB, in the building planning departments and also with technological intervention in order to reduce the effects that noise has on the auditive and extra-auditive organs and thus limit possible sublimal messages which certainly do not benefit the psycho-physical well-being of the diners.",

Affective forces, such as sexist or racist abuse hurled at bodies online or in the street, are entangled with more recognisable, codified emotions (fear, shame, hate). Affect conceptualises feelings as relational rather than as discrete states of being inhering in separately bounded bodies. Affect displaces reason/emotion, mind/body, self/other binaries and offers alternative – and more affirmative – explanations of how and why sensation and feeling matter. Affect studies have a long philosophical history, reaching back to Spinoza's interest in the capacities of bodies and how bodies can affect and be affected. Sad and joyful affects are implicated in reducing or expanding embodied capacities.",

      "abstract": "Soundness of mind at the time of committing an offence is complementary to mental maturity as a condition for the criminal capacity of the perpetrator and is thus a condition for the criminality of his act. Accordingly, the perpetrator's mental disorder 1 limits the criminality of his act, although not every such disorder has such radical legal consequences. If the disorder is cognitive, it must be such as to prevent the person from understanding the physical or social meaning of his conduct: if it is volitional, it must be such as to prevent him, at the time of his act, from choosing between performing the act and refraining from doing so. These are symptoms of mental disorder that negatives the criminal capacity of a person, and each of them is a necessary, but not a sufficient, condition. It is essential :that this be due to a disease of the mind or an organic defect of reason. The disorder in question is therefore a radical one, and one that is also chronic if not permanent in nature, as opposed to temporary or less deep-rooted conditions such as a disturbed state, a trauma or emotional condition, impulsiveness in certain matters or urges that deviate from the normal in certain areas.",

      "abstract": "The position to be assigned to a man of science in the history of his subject cannot be estimated solely by his published work. The record of that work is permanent; its merit may be judged as well a hundred years hence as it is at present. But there is an invisible element in the fruition of creative, because it depends on character as well as on genius and ability. Men have risen to possessed to an impression on the intellectual level of their time. Such men possessed to an exceptional degree that immunity from the influence of current thought which is the essence of originality, but they were the slaves rather than the masters of their own individuality. To receive inspiration as well as to impart it, to stimulate though at the right moment, to keep in touch with others without losing independence requires human sympathy as well ad originality, and it was the combination of the two qualities, each strong in itself and further strengthened by being linked to the other, that has been the outstanding feature of Lord Rayleigh’s work. The life of such a man cannot be treated as an independent unit, for it is too intimately connected with it did not directly concern itself. It is essential, therefore, to give a brief account of the position of Physics at the time Lord Rayleigh began work. When he took his degree in 1865, the conception of a strictly mechanical construction of the Universe had received strong support through the successes of the undulatory theory of light and the foundation of thermodynamics. Though foreshadowed to some extent in the laws of motion of Galileo and Newton, the principle of the Conservation of Energy had only recently found general acceptance. Men still in the prime of life remembered the days when Joule's experiments were looked upon with distrust, and his views on the nature of heat as heterodox. William Thomson, the future Lord Kelvin, barely forty years old, was in the zenith of his activity, and it was mainly through his efforts that the second law of thermodynamics was formulated while Rayleigh was at school. About the time he entered the University, Maxwell applied the laws of probability to the kinetic theory of gases, and while he was getting ready for his Tripos, the same author's great paper on \"A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field\" was communicated to the Royal Society. The undulatory theory of light had been placed on a sound dynamical basis by Green and Stokes. Though Foucault had disposed of all remaining doubts by showing experimentally that light was propagated through water more slowly than through air, there were some few sceptics still.—Faraday was alive, though deprived of his intellectual powers and nearing his death.",

      "title": "Critical Thinking: Thinking to Some Purpose.",
      "abstract": "A British scholar by the name of Susan Stebbing (1952) once wrote a book on the importance of purpose in thinking. In it she said: think logically is to think relevantly to the purpose that initiated the thinking: all effective thinking is directed to an end. We agree. All thinking pursues a purpose. We do not think unless we have something we are trying to accomplish, some aim in view, or something we want. In other words, when humans think about the world we do not do so randomly but rather in line with our goals, desires, needs, and values. Our thinking is an integral part of a patterned way of acting in the world, and we act, even in simple matters, with some set of ends in view. To understand someone's thinking-including our own-we must understand the functions it serves, what it is about, the direction it is moving, the ends that make sense of it. In a word, we must understand that person's purpose. Of course, much of what we are after in our thinking is not obvious to us. Raising human goals and desires to the level of conscious realization is an important part of critical thinking. In other words, though we always have a purpose in thinking, we are not always fully aware of that purpose. We may have some vague idea of it. Perhaps we have not clearly come to terms with our purpose. For example, everyone's thinking is a product of many influences, most of which we have never thought about. Consider some of the major influences that shaped your thinking (and ours): You were born into a culture (European, American, African, Asian). You were born at some point in time (in some century in some year). You were born in some place (in the country, in the city, in the North or South, East or West). You were raised by parents with particular beliefs (about the family, about personal relationships, about marriage, about childhood, about obedience, about religion, about politics, about schooling, etc.). You formed various associations, largely based on who was around you, associations with people with a viewpoint, values, and taboos. Change any one of these influences and your goals and purposes would be different. Consider this, suppose you had been born in the Middle Ages as a serf in the fields in France. Can you see that if you had, virtually all of your beliefs would be altered? See if you can perform similar reflective experiments of your own. For example, imagine other changes in these influences, and then imaginatively compare some of the beliefs you likely would have with the beliefs you actually do have. You will begin to appreciate how much you, and every other human, are a product of influences over which you, and they, had little or no control. Neither you nor we directed these influences upon us. Their effects, clearly, were both good and bad. If, for example, we assume that many of these influences engendered in us beliefs that are false, it follows that in our minds right now there are false beliefs, and we are acting on them. Yet, we must realize that the mind has no mechanism for screening out false beliefs. In other words, we all carry around in our minds prejudices from our culture, prejudices from where we were born and raised, prejudices from our parents, and prejudices from our friends and associates. Finding ways to locate those flawed beliefs and replace them with more reasonable ones is part of the agenda of critical thinking. One problem with human thinking is that we sometimes pursue contradictory ends. We might want to become educated but also want to avoid doing any intellectual work. We might want others to love us but not behave in loving ways toward them. We might want people to trust us but behave in ways that undermine trust. The purpose we might explicitly state may be simply what we would like to believe of ourselves, and our real purpose might be one that we would be ashamed to admit. We might think we want to get into medical school to help and care for people when our actual purpose may be to make a lot of money, gain prestige and status, and be admired by others. …",

      "abstract": "It seems that a certain consensus exists to speak about a traumatic situation as an experience which is made up of a threat on the physical or psychological integrity of a person and against which one responds with fear, desperation and intensive horror. Different psychological phenomena are involved with the manner through which a human being confronts his/her past. In particular, the response to traumatic situations, mourning, and blame share their characteristic of being an irreversible living reality related to facts, loss or past impacts and it is necessary to integrate these in one's life in order to advance; these comprise a triangle frequently coexisting and interconnected. Aid for these three situations has, therefore, as common elements, two premises: an active task is required by the person who suffers this situation; this person must, in some form, desire to move ahead. One can not toil in mourning, in a traumatic experience, or in a life of blame if these have a positive symbolic value for this person; for example, mourning as a manner not to treason the dead person by forgetting that person, the reliving a trauma as an attempt to provide some sense to the actions which occurred, or blame as a desire to not forget an error or as a final punishment of this active task; the final objective of this active task is not usually to forget but to integrate in order to live. If a person does not perceive this clearly, this person may not become actively involved in the task to overcome a traumatic situation and to move ahead, nor will that person accept that a person who tries to help questions this person's realities or experiences.",

Thus, denial of one’s role (e.g., motivated forgetting), minimization of harm or intentionality (e.g., automatism, dissociation), and offering “good” (e.g., a moral mandate) or “good enough” (e.g., revenge) justifications for one’s behavior can all be used to deflect the label. Alternatively, people may try to neutralize the label by pointing to their moral credentials prior to the incident in question (moral licensing), insisting that they are no worse than those who judge them (a form of normalization), or declaring that they are immune to others’ judgments (asserting interpersonal power).",

      "abstract": "To assert the primacy of practice is a refusal to accord primacy to language, and this is what is maintained in relation to the emergence of self-consciousness. The effect of asserting it is to make the embodied practices of human beings in the world more important than their social relations for the emergence of selfhood, meaning a continuous sense of self, and for the development of its properties and powers, meaning reflexivity, which only exists in potentia for every neonate. The primacy of practice refers both to its logical and substantive priority in human development. This is not simply a matter of it coming before anything else, though temporally it does just that; it is also a question of viewing language itself as a practical activity, which means taking seriously that our words are quite literally deeds, and ones which do not enjoy hegemony over our other doings in the emergence of our sense of self.",

The cult therefore is placed in the center of every religion and carries across the ritual behaviors, which are usually presided over by a special individual believed to be particularly competent for the job: he can be a priest, a wizard, a shaman, or even a member of the group who is believed to be in possession of special gifts.",

      "title": "Duty",
      "abstract": "To have a duty is, above all, to be subject to a binding, normative requirement. This means that unless there are exculpating reasons someone who has a duty is required to satisfy it, and can be justifiably criticized for not doing so. Having a duty to do something is like having been given a command by someone who has a right to be obeyed: it must be done. Sometimes we speak as if we have duties to individuals (such as persons and institutions). So, for example, if Jones makes a promise to Smith, then Jones has a duty to Smith to keep the promise. We also talk as if we have duties to perform, or to refrain from performing, types of actions, for instance, a duty to help those in need. Even if the performance of such a duty involves treating an individual in a certain way, the duty may not be to that individual. For example, a duty to be charitable might not be a duty to anyone, not even the recipient of the charity. An important feature of duties is that they provide some justifying reason for action. If we explain why we did something by saying that it was our duty, we are offering a justification for the action. Such a justifying reason does not depend on the entire nature of the action. For example, if we make a promise, we have some justifying reason for keeping it, regardless of what was promised, or to whom the promise was made. Again it is like a command. If we are given a command by someone with a right to be obeyed, we have some justification for obeying it, no matter what we are commanded to do. On some views, however, the justifying reason we have for doing something because it is required by duty may not be decisive: we may have an even better reason for doing something else. None the less, that something is required by duty provides some justifying reason for doing it. Talk about duties is found in many areas; we speak, for example, of legal duties, moral duties, professional duties, the duties of a scholar and, even, matrimonial duties. This discussion will focus on moral duty, but may have wider application.",

The name of it is an everyday life absorbing practically entirely the Absolutes of distant cultures. But it is also wrong to think that nature/ the Universe, God and society vanished from sight of the present-day human being. It is undoubtedly wrong to think so. The thing is that all these things God and world and the other are given in the light of daily routine. The world of everyday life may be characterized by such a feature as concreteness. «Concretus» in Latin means «adnateness». Now we also have a reduction of human being to the world of everyday life as the result of realization values of the Renaissance and the Age of the Enlightenment intention deliverancing everybody and everything (secularization, subjectivation and such other processes). Opposing and struggling with transcendental human being created its` own postworld. A person of everyday life may/ commonplace person is accustomed to rut, comfort and stability. He prefers to dream about a reality, about his personality to be a real personality or a real Human being. Nevertheless a present-day person has a little thirst for transcendence. In the situation of fulminant going out of date some models of things it is become clear, that a human being is aimed at a consumption not only use value, but something other it (meta-). It means that he buys not only goods, but his own status, (public) image, success, wealth, fortune, and not only… On our opinion nowadays person together with goods tries to buy transcendental, to buy metaphysics proper. Reconstruction of everyday life senses goes to transcendence of emerging opportunity for the: a) transfiguration of reality (Palamism) in which Jesus Christ has come and has become the ever-present: b) «the world shining with sense» (A. Schutz); c) «the world where everything is becoming» (I. Prigogine) Transcendence has some own risks. For example, everything may close up on human being or it may dissolve into unconsciousness. This also may follows to social reality worship (stability as cult). It is also possible the way of dissolving in trans-cendent, which follows to mystical turn. All existence under the significance sign is very problematic, opened and accountable, complicity and eventful. The main thing in this continuum becomes not a human production, but his self-standing in spite of market totalitarianism and forming now new simulacra market, which is made with the help of postmodernism methods. Self-standing itself is important as a human form of conversion, as the indicator of his Spirit life. Summing it all it is possible to say, that everyday life is observing as a structure where exists transformed «marks» of events of transcendence or human breaks to some Other. Thanks to it senses giving chance for real being are constitute.",

      "abstract": "The integrated wholeness of the organism must be reemphasized. We should not take a localizable, somatic, partial drive as paradigm for motivation theory. The study of motivation should stress ultimate rather than partial goals, ends rather than means to ends. a) not only conscious but also unconscious motivations must be accounted for in a theory of motivation. There are, customarily, different cultural paths to the same goal. Therefore, conscious, specific, local desires are not so useful for motivation theory as fundamental, unconscious goals. Motivated behavior, either preparatory or consummatory, must be understood to be a channel through which many needs may be expressed or satisfied. Usually acts have more than one motivation. Practically all organismic states are to be understood as motivated. Man is a perpetually wanting animal; the appearance of a need rests on prior situations, on other prepotent needs; needs or desires must be arranged in hierarchies of prepotency. Lists of drives will get us no place for various reasons. Any classification of motivations must deal with the problem of level or specificity of classification. Classifications of motivations must be based upon goals rather than upon instigating drives. Motivation theory must be anthropocentric, not animalcentric. The situation or the field in which the organism reacts must be taken into account but it must be done with a dynamic interpretation of the situation or the field. Not only the integration of the organism must be taken into account but also the possibility of isolated, specific, partial or segmental responses must also be included.12",

      "abstract": "One of the chief tasks incumbent on a nation at war is to look after those of its citizens who have been severely disabled in the service of their country.For the uninformed this is merely a surgical and financial matter, but the informed have long known that the working capacity and social readaptation of the disabled man do not exclusively depend on his physical condition.To a large extent they depend on his state of mind.An ablebodied man who goes out to fight and comes back badly maimed encounters a variety of problems arising from his disability; according to his temperament and character he either is able to solve them or fails.If he fails he creates a good deal of unhappiness for himself and those around him, and eventually he may become a liability to the community.While great strides have been made in many aspects of the after-care of the disabled, it is felt that the psychological aspect has so far received insufficient attention.What follows is a summary of detailed reports on each of the disabilities studied-loss of limb, blindness, loss of vision in one eye.Considerations of space necessitate omission of much of the confirmatory and explanatory evidence.-200amputees, 103 war-blinded, and 102 monocular individuals were examined psychiatrically, each of them for at least two hours.Charac- teristics common to all three types of disabled men, and differences in their emotional, social, and occupational situation specific for each of the disabilities, are discussed. I. EMOTIONAL SITUATIONA. Common Characteristics Commoni Psychological Features.-Severelydisabled men, irrespective of the specific nature of their disability, are apt to regard it as a defect which lowers their status in the eyes of their fellow citizens.In extreme cases, sometimes with but more usually without foundation, the men are afraid that they may become an encumbrance to their families or to the community at large.Fear that they may not stand an equal chance with able-bodied men is very common.They are appreciative of acts of kindness if not overdone.Those who are badly disfigured are especially concerned by the doubt whether they are lovable by women any longer, and acknow- ledge gratefully any evidence that this is still the case.Fear that they receive sympathy or pity, which they loathe, rather than true affection, which they'want, is hard to dispel.Their feelings of inferiority account for their frantic desire to con- ceal their disability and, if it makes them dependent on other people, to assert their independence.Like any other minority uncertain of its social status, they clamour for their rights and are very sensitive to any real or imagined encroachments upon them.Since time immemorial evil-doers have repeatedly been depicted as disabled, freaks, or cripples.These writers obviously sensed that disablement mobilizes aggressiveness arising from envy and frustration.Owing to their ill-temper, disabled persons are often difficult to get on with.",

Hate is often seen as “evil,” especially when manifesting as hate speech or hate crimes. Because people generally do not want to be seen as evil, haters are often reluctant to own the experience unless they can justify it—by labeling the target “evil,” for example. Hate that cannot be justified is sometimes disguised, as when intimate partner violence, stalking, and other mate retention tactics are labeled “jealousy” or even “love” by perpetrators (and sometimes victims). Whether disguised, or fleeting, or a means to some other end such as revenge or the temporary quashing of fear of abandonment, the desire for harm to befall another qualifies as hate.",

      "title": "Regulación de la natalidad y violencia",
      "abstract": "Ours is a period marked by violence, and, most important, it is no stranger either to reproduction. In order to clarify concepts, by violence we mean, formally speaking, any interference or action by an external agent on a situation, structure, phenomenon or process with the object of nullifying it or of changing either its meaning (by deviation) or its intensity (by slowing it down or by accelerating it).\r\nIn this sense violence is not intrinsically illicit. One must distinguish between violence and violation . After a short study of the concepts of law, order and justice in the fundamental works of the principal Natural Law investigators of the present day, the author arrives at the conclusion that the genuine meaning of the term violation is any attempt against a principle of order, either directly of by undermining any of the other elements of order, be they real or related. \r\nThe human vocation of dominion over Nature, insofar as Man is a superior being, should not be thought of in absolute terms: it consists in being responsible for the conservation, reproduction, development and perfection of all creatures that tend towards their completeness according to individual ends which integrate themselves progressively towards one general goal. For this mission, which in general terms is called culture , man has a certain autonomy , but not full independence ; and the degree of autonomy is much more reduced with respect to his own species than in the case of inferior creatures. Man's capacity and his science can suffer deviations.\r\nInsofar as biology is concerned, these presentday deviations are serious and well known. The attempt against the physical and natural order, especially in the animal sphere, is widespread and threatens to obtain firm footing.\r\nIn this sense, we see that violence is being used, not in its lawful (and at times necessary) meaning of correction , of restoration of order, but as its violation .\r\nThe author has confined his examination of the problem to the question of human population: he discusses three fundamental aspects: prostitution of the biological culture, separation of erotic appetite and reproduction, conflict between individual rights and social interests .\r\nThe «scientific» attempts against the reproductive processes, including those previous to gametogenesis as well as the actual fertilization, are classified together under the heading of contraception . Both aspects are studied extensively and the author concludes that they are unlawful according to the Natural Law. The arguments of the proponents of contraception are studied and compared with those of their opponents, and special importance is given to biological and philosophical considerations; the conclusion is that no jurist with proper regard for legal considerations can accept theories that contradict authority and that can well be classified as setting precedents, especially when the matter is undergoing research.\r\nThe author examines the various present-day aspects of the «sexual revolution» as a key to explaining the many postulates and tendencies as well as the possible collision between individual rights and group interests.\r\nThe question of continence and Chastity are next examined. The discussion of human reproduction oscillates today between the two poles of «biological» and «scientific» arguments, with considerations regarding the meaning and limitations of these expressions and their consequences and applications. This is followed by a short analysis of the pragmatic attitude adopted by various politicians in their approach to these questions. After some short reflections on the limitations of human freedom implied by the present attitude towards the sexual revolution, the author makes a final conclusion in which he refers to self-control.",

No obstante, el comportamiento que es producto de la evolución, incluido el de otros animales, no está completamente desprovisto de normatividad. Si se define la normatividad como la adhesión a un ideal o estándar, existe amplia evidencia de que los animales tratan a sus relaciones sociales de esta manera. En otras palabras, persiguen valores sociales. En este artículo reviso la evidencia sobre el hecho de que los primates no humanos intentan activamente preservar la armonía dentro de su red social, por ejemplo, reconciliándose después de un conflicto, protestando contra las divisiones desiguales y deteniendo peleas. Al hacerlo, corrigen las desviaciones respecto de un estado ideal. Sumado a ello, y con el fin de prevenir tales desviaciones, muestran autocontrol emocional y resolución anticipada de conflictos. El reconocimiento de la orientación hacia una meta y el carácter normativo del comportamiento social animal nos permite cerrar parcialmente la brecha entre el ‘es’ y el ‘debe’ erigida en relación con el comportamiento moral humano.",

      "abstract": "The world of things in the information society breaks the established boundaries of its everyday existence and perception, exposing itself in a variety of forms, interconnections and articulations of bodily transformations. This process allows us to see behind the usual material background of everyday artifacts the endless social drama in the battle of human being for the acculturation and domestication of nature. A thing as an object of culture appears in a variety of guises – as a character, event, sign, symbol and narrative, but each time joining in the conversation about the urgent and life-and-death in the incessant dialogue of human being with his creation. Despite the seeming material autonomy, burden and inviolability of the objective world – things are not at all indifferent to the experiences, preferences and values of individual. In one case, they bind their creator to themselves or even enslave him, imprisoning a person in the walls built around him, in another – they protect and save from the onslaught of external forces, providing people with the necessary means to tame the elements, arrange the world and promote their aspirations, ambitions and plans. In this article, the objective world of culture is considered through its coupling with creative practices and innovations decisions. Cultural artifacts objectively mark the social world, which allows us to consider them as a kind of warning signs of distinction and memorable marks. Things attract people, just as people attract them to themselves in the implementation of their needs and plans. Things acquire their communicative properties in a cultural context that sets and forms the social significance of an artifact, making it an economically useful, aesthetically attractive and recognizable object. Creativity of action turns a thing into an accomplice and designer of a new cultural reality, which the author tries to show in her article.",

      "title": "The Resemblances of the Concept of Love in Theravada Buddhist Philosophy and Stoicism: A Comparative Study",
      "abstract": "In Theravada Buddhist Philosophy, love exists as psychological activities that can be called by many names such as Sineha or romantic love, Karma or erotic love, Pema or family love, Metta or compassionate love etc. Variety of love is also categorized into lower kinds and higher kinds of love. Lower kind of love refers to those psychological activities that demand possession of the objects that we love while higher kinds refers to psychological activities that extends goodness to others. However, love, as well as everything, is governed by the Law of Impermanence, meaning that it occurs, comes into being and then cease to be. The highest form of love in Buddhism is, presumably, called Chanta (the will) or the love of dharma which is the highest truth and the wisdom to be free from all attachments. Similarly, the Stoic philosophers (c.300 B.C.-c. 300 A.D.) try to live their lives according to their ideal state of happiness (Eudaimonia) by avoiding the emotions such as desire, pain, grief, fear and passion. The Stoics hold that such feelings are caused by false judgements and that the wiseman who had attained moral and intellectual perfection would not undertake them. The later stoic philosophers such as Seneca and Epictetus, emphasize the doctrine that the wiseman is entirely resilient to misfortune and that virtue is satisfactory condition for happiness. Thus, passionate or romantic love is an unnecessary condition for human to attain happiness. In this research paper, the researcher attempts to identify the commonalities in the concept of love of two ancient school of thoughts, one from the western and the other from the eastern part of the world. The result will support at the international level, the expansion of knowledge in the field of philosophy of love.",

      "abstract": "Drawing on categories of imposed and intrinsic relevances developed by Alfred Schutz, as well as on affirmative model definitions of impairment and disability, this article develops an argument proposing the usefulness of disability identity. Disability is not just about what people with impairments are prevented from doing and being, but about what they are required to do and be instead. Whether this involves taking on roles as passive recipients of others’ benevolence or involvement in demonstrations of the unimportance of impairment, either way negates the lived experience of impairment and signifies the desirability of normality. It is suggested that embracing rather than attempting to disassociate the impaired self from disability identity – recognising disability as oppression and absurdity and resolving to face this - enables this self to claim impairment as valid and ordinary human experience and to resist the invalidating requirements of the disabled role.",

      "abstract": "One broad category of things we devalue is dirt. If it gets on us, we may\nfeel polluted or devalued too. This is unfortunate because work tends\nto be dirty: it creates (or otherwise involves handling) a great deal of\nextraneous or displaced matter.1 Manual work involves moving material around, shaping and transforming things, creating useful products\non the one hand and dirt, dust and detritus on the other. Hence, if dirt\ngives rise to indignity, much work is likely to be found undigniﬁed also.\nAnd this is the case despite claims that new forms of work are cleaner\nand unpolluted, rendering an analysis of dirt and work unmeaningful (Reeves, 2001). This chapter explores the conceptual connections\nbetween work, dirt and dignity by comparing and contrasting responses\nto three occupations that have typically produced a good deal of dirt.\nIt is argued that, against expectation, exposure to dirt in daily work\nis not necessarily or intrinsically undigniﬁed. Considering the circumstances in which dirty work need not be undigniﬁed as well as the\ncircumstances in which it becomes so is the rationale for this chapter.",

      "title": "Just War Determination through Human Acts Valuation: An Igbo-African Experience",
      "abstract": "This paper analytically reflects and x-rays the African perspective of just war using human act valuation as the basis of argument. In the wake of time, philosophers, psychologists and ethicists have differentiated between two kinds of actions, namely human action and action of man. Accordingly, man is convinced that he is different from the rest of the animal family; hence he acts at a level which dogs, for example, cannot attain. In any case, man does not always act as a man; his activity is not always stamped by what distinguishes him from other beings, namely rationality. Sometimes, he acts at the level he shares with other living beings; in other words, his activity at this level is ruled by a natural necessity or determined in the sense that doings at this sphere are not called actions, for they are ‘instinctive, thoughtless movement, mannerisms, reflex actions, or what is done under the influence of psychic constraints, hypnotic suggestions or demented frenzy etc.’ Such actions are rightly called actions of a human being, since their source is that bodily and spiritual individual who is called Peter, Paul, etc., but they are not human actions per se. They do not express the individual being; they do not proceed from him precisely as a human being. The only genuinely human action is the one which a human being performs in virtue of what distinguishes him from other beings. Since this is nothing other than reason, or rather, rationality, human actions are the actions which are performed when he acts as a rational being. Therefore, human acts are those actions of man that have their source in man’s rationality or spirituality, understood in terms of human’s interiority from which his activities flow. Beyond this, the African has got another sense of human act valuation, which is community-based or community-centered. In line with this, an attempt is made here to demonstrate how just war can be determined through human act valuation using the Igbo-African perspective as a case study.",

Physical survival and the negotiation of social situations constantly require that we act or abstain from acting. The latter can be, of course, construed as a form of action. The kernel of a circus action is the implementation of a physically challenging plan but such actions are performed within a cluster of verbal, musical, and visual modifiers whose deliberate purpose is to make the actions appear easier or more difficult and dangerous than they actually are. The attitudes and behaviour of the assistants who monitor aerial acts from the ground play a significant part in construing modality of an action as particularly dangerous. Trainers belong to two different categories depending on whether they deal with domestic animals of higher status like dogs and horses or wild animals which qualify them as able to perform the impossible.",

      "title": "The Doctrine of Harm in Law",
      "abstract": "Law is based on the basic rights of individuals—of people with a conscience, morality, and philosophy—which translates to the daily common sense of humans and their moral behavior. These lead to an understanding of what is ‘‘reasonable’’ and ‘‘acceptable’’ within the human context for norms of behavior. By far, the most pervasive doctrine and philosophy of law is the doctrine of mutual respect where no party is permitted to hurt another. In fact, one is not even allowed to hurt oneself, because doing so is against the common principle and purpose of human life. The concept of ‘‘hurt’’ takes on physical, mental, economic, and reputational aspects. This doctrine pervades every area of law, be it environmental law, liability law, or contract law. Moreover, each and every one of The Ten Commandments revolves around not hurting or damaging another or oneself or the source of the universe, since we get all our energy from there. No one can be harmed or damaged—willfully or negligently. This requires the exercise of caution and restraint by all individuals in every part of their daily life: at the mall, on the road, in public meetings, and under professional circumstances. The philosophy of human rights stems from the fundamental belief that no one should be harmed or deprived from basic human needs—food, medicine, shelter, respect, physical security, and spiritual freedom. It is for freedom from harm that all laws are enacted in a civil society. It is this simple concept of ‘‘harm’’ that underpins law and seeks to interpret situations to discover who is at fault for having generated the harm. The interpretation of this in civil engineering is convoluted, for issues of technology, engineering, business, accounting, and finance are intertwined with principles of law. A lawyer alone will be unable to interpret civil engineering law, while a civil engineer alone will similarly fail to understand the legal ramifications of the issues. This is why it takes lawyers and civil engineers, working together, to solve their legal problems. Consequently, this also underpins the need for our special Legal Affairs section. In institutional matters—such as issues of contract law, criminal law, liability law, or insurance law—it is hard to justify the supposition that any random technique and means will be justified by the end. Every action taken must be harmless and benign. Negligence and ignorance of the harmful effects of actions do not exempt one. There is too much respect and dignity for morality, the individual, and the rights of life and free commerce for harm to be allowed at any time.",

      "abstract": "I USE here not (in the first instance) in the sense of not harming or not intending to harm, but in the sense of not being accountable for the consequences (possibly harmful, although this is no longer essential to the meaning of the term) of not having knowledge one does not happen to have-knowledge that one might have or even be expected or assumed to have. Innocence in this sense is not the same thing as ignorance, but it presupposes ignorance. Of course the two senses are connected, since it was tasting the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge that constituted the traditional first loss of innocence, but that is not a line I wish to follow here, even though it is not without relevance to the issues I shall be discussing. There are some things one can't come to know without losing one's innocence in some respect or other-coming to know which reveals hitherto unrealized possibilities of error, either already committed (as in the evangelical conviction of sin) or encountered for the first time, whether as risk or temptation. Such knowledge may be disquieting, but it may also be liberating, since error does not necessarily ensue, nor is it the only new possibility. In this short article I want to deal with a kind of knowledge of language, which has consequences for the understanding of literature, that I think falls under this description. A useful paradigm case of loss of innocence in the sense I mean, and that I have described elsewhere, is something that happens frequently in the history of individual religious belief. Somebody growing up in a closed community, and learning only one set of beliefs, may die in the faith without ever having felt a challenge to it. But just knowing that an alternative set of beliefs exists and is held, let us say, by infidels may start a chain of thought like this: here are two sets of beliefs that contradict one another; they cannot both be true, so one of them must be false; but if one is false the other may be false also, so there may be no true belief. Language has this in common with religious belief, that the one we start with is characteristically that of the culture we grow up in, and it may be a long time before we grasp the significance of the fact that there are others. It need not ever be grasped: people (English tourists on the Continent used to be one of the stock examples) can observe that foreigners",

      "title": "Forgiveness: A Quiet Assault on the Malicious",
      "abstract": "Forgiveness is the self's quiet assault on the power of the malicious and the injurious. Its aim is to repair the breaches and fracture the malicious that the injurious create within the self, between the self and other(s), within self-narratives and memory-vignettes, across the social order and in the fields of representation. It does this in two crucial ways: publicly, as a ritualised speech-act, and privately, as a form of affective reattunement to be fully functional both of these must apply. Publicly, forgiveness operates as a ritual and not as a transaction, because forgiveness, unlike a transaction, can neither require nor demand reciprocity. Forgiveness always operates within the possibility of its repudiation by the other. As a ritualised speech-act, it imposes its own version of things on the other beyond the other's power of negation, something a transaction, enmeshed in the logic of exchange, cannot achieve. Public ritual of forgiveness, in spite of this structural non-reciprocity, holds the other accountable even in the act of releasement of that accountability, a releasement that, ephemerally, negates the ongoing force that the malicious purports to have. It does this in two ways: first, by proclaiming a judgment of what is not one's own—the other's malevolence, indifference or harm—and releasing the self socially from the stigmatizing traces of the offence; second, by speaking into being a version of self and a form of social dignity that negates and survives the malicious. Privately, forgiveness involves affective reattunement, which begins with decathexis of the breach in self and self-narrative wrought by the malicious. This entails a releasing of the affect held by the psychic wound whose splitting force has generated a new, fractured identity-possibility for the self. The self must withdraw investments in the identity possibilities constituted by psychic injury and the rectitude that transforms such injury into victimhood and identity formation. This involves the self's release of the shame wrought by injury and malice. Forgiveness, then, in its potential twofold structure enables the self to generate an event and a condition of being that, at least ephemerally, negates much of the retroactive and ongoing force of the malicious and the injurious.",

      "title": "Learned helplessness",
      "abstract": "Helplessness is a state in which nothing a person opts to do affects what is happening. It is the quitting or the give up response that follows the conviction that whatever a person does doesn't matter.[1] Learned helplessness (LH) was initially used to label the failure of certain laboratory animals to escape or avoid shock, despite giving an opportunity, subsequent to earlier exposure to unavoidable shock.[23] Now, the term has been applied to the failure of human beings to pursue, utilize, or acquire adaptive instrumental responses. It is observed in a depressed person who seems to have given up hope that effective voluntary control over important environmental events is possible.[4] People suffering from LH accept that bad things will take place and they will have little control over them.[5] Those who are exposed to complex problems for an extended period learn that responses and events are unconnected. Learning attained in this situation weakens imminent learning and leads to inactivity. Consequently, they will be unsuccessful to resolve any concern even if there is a possible solution for the concern.[6] The LH hypothesis has been reformulated as the old hypothesis does not distinguish between the outcomes that are uncontrollable for all the people and those uncontrollable only for some (universal vs. personal helplessness). It does not explain when helplessness is general or specific; chronic or acute. Reformulation states that the helplessness is attributed to a cause by people. The cause can be stable or unstable, global or specific, and internal or external.[7] Helplessness may be considered as a consequence of early socialization experiences. More specifically, the rigidity and negativism emphasized in our family systems are likely to affect the child's development of competence. A number of sociocultural features may also play their part. Hence, it is essential to explore the role of socialization as it relates to the development of child's helplessness.[6] Children who had history of abuse and neglect during their childhood and adolescence can develop a state of LH. Consequences of emotional abuse may be repeated abnormal or disrupted attachment development and the sufferer blames him/herself for the abuse, leading to LH, emotional distress, and excessively inactive behavior. Psychological abuse is often combined with other forms of abuse.[8] Children who have experienced chronic neglect are likely to have attribution models which conceptualize themselves as powerless and of low value. Neglected children are less likely to know that they are being neglected or to know that something can be done about it.[910] The capacity to cope, and thrive, subsequent to an adverse experience is often stated as resilience. A number of protective and supportive factors may contribute to an abused or neglected child's resilience. These include positive attachment, self-esteem, intelligence, emotion regulation, humor, and independence.[11] LH may be observed in the elderly, due to repeated exposure to events perceived beyond their control eventually display cognitive, motivational, and affective deficits of helplessness. The loss of self-esteem may also occur if the individual believes that he/she is personally accountable for the situations.[12] Other effects of elder abuse may include feelings such as separation, guilt, shame, fear, anxiety, and rejection.[13] The LH model gives the impression that instrumental coping behavior is the most adaptive response to threat on every occasion. Nonetheless, adaptive escape/avoidance responses are not always available for some kinds of aversive events. This is of some clinical and behavioral guidance interest to the dentists.[1415] Learned Helplessness and Dental Practice The theory of LH provides an understanding of certain noncompliant behavior observed in some of the dental patients. Patients experience a loss of self-esteem due to the feeling of helplessness and victimization, or suspicion and doubt of what the oral health-care provider says or does that can lead to communication failure.[16] History of childhood and adult trauma related to various types of abuse and neglect appears to be significantly associated with high dental fear although multiple factors play a key role. Various degrees of helplessness, powerlessness, and incidents of lack of control during dental treatments were reported. Fears of being trapped in the dental chair, claustrophobia, being unable to breathe, and feeling of chocking or severe gagging that interferes with dental treatments were reported.[17] The noise created by dental operatory can induce LH, increase arousal, alter the choice of task approach, and decrease the attention of the dental patients.[18] Dental practitioners and their auxiliaries can play distinct role in facilitating to prevent or reverse the effects of helplessness in their patients. The practitioners can enhance the perceived control of their patients, by providing them with choices that are probable and practical, which will enhance their success experience. They also need to promote autonomy and self-sufficiency in their patients, and to discard the penchant to do everything for the patients, those age/skill appropriate tasks that can be individually accomplished. Dental staff members can use these guidelines to improve the quality of their communication with their patients and can be influential in preventing or reducing the behavioral discrepancies associated with LH.[12] We have a crucial role in identifying this state of LH in our dental patients, including children, adolescents, adults, elderly, or those with special health-care needs and guide them consequently in a dental situation. Otherwise, they may continue to suffer the pain and discomfort if any, without complaining, that may lead to long term consequences.",

Religion of Nature and other forms of religious naturalism can help to make us not only keenly aware of this inexorable fact but also able positively to affirm it. The chapter analyses the issue of how best to practice religious naturalism in one's own life is a matter to be weighed and considered by each individual in his or her own ways and in light of his or her passions, interests, and strengths.",

Furthermore, the Mexican American is someone who knows the world of everyday life in common with others, and with others takes it for granted, and who uses background expectancies (i.e. common knowledge of everyday scenes) as a scheme of interpretation to manage his everyday affairs. The Mexican American, then, like any other member of society, not only engages in what Garfinkel calls judgmental work, but in doing so constantly relies upon the background knowledge of commonplace settings which he presumes he shares with others.2 That is, the Mexican American in managing his everyday affairs presumably does not comply with preestablished and legitimate alternative courses of action as spelled out by the dominant culture's normative abstract explanations of human behavior as described in most sociological theory. Rather, he tends to rely upon commonsense understandings of social structures about which we have little knowledge, and not upon the idealized norms that have been attributed to his culture or social status in the larger society by social scientists. True, the idealized norms of the social order form part of his background knowledge, but they do not fully explain how he goes about interpreting the norms to make sense of the many situations the Mexican American finds himself in and which may not have anything to do with his cultural heritage. In normative type explanations the primary focus tends to be on the Mexican American as he exists as a separate entity.3 That is to say, he is presented as if he lives in a vacuum, as if he is not part of a larger social system, and as if the linkages he has with the larger society do not make a difference in how he organizes and manages his affairs. Little attention is given to the dynamic aspects of how the Mexican American plays out his daily life in terms of other people; how he and other members of society with whom he interacts organize their ongoing activities to cope with the",

These events stimulate our senses, enliven our emotions, and captivate our minds. The enthronement of popes, the inauguration of presidents, the burial of heroes arrest our attention and embed memories that last a lifetime. Everyone loves sensory pageantry. Some rituals focus the attention, feed the imagination, evoke the remembrance of things past as well as the desires of things to come, and inspire dramatic actions that stand out against their everyday background. Yet the salience of such dramatic spectacles should not obscure the fact that \"ritual\" often refers to the repetition of small and thoroughly mundane acts. Even though these rituals break with the ordinary world too, they frequently remain thoroughly humdrum. They trigger automatic responses that appear to be completely mindless. If we focus on participants' psychological responses in ritual situations, we cannot fail to notice the different degrees of emotion involved in these two sorts of cases. Some rituals are so emotionally arousing that their effects seem to last forever. In other rituals emotion seems to play little, if any, role.",

According Weber, interpretative sociology considers individual and his actions as basic social unit, and he felt that task of sociology was to reduce [certain categories of human interaction] 'understandable' 2 Social action, in Weberian sense, distinguished from mere behavior. Action which oriented toward inanimate objects, for example, does not qualify. Action social if, and then only in so far as, it takes account of behavior of someone else. Further, action involves more than mere contact of individuals. Being jostled about by people in a crowded department store does not, according Weber, constitute social action. Action of a social character is confined cases where actor's behavior meaningfully oriented that of others. In short, behavior which intentional, and which oriented toward behavior of other human beings qualifies as social behavior.5 Intentional behavior, meaningful behavior, and subjectively understandable behavior are, all three, synonymous with regard",

Neither is it a phenomenological, hermeneutical, political, aesthetical or ethnographical account of silence taken as a form of existential practice. It concerns an ethics. It explores, rather than an ethics of semiotic care or recognition, an ethical structure, possibility or resources of silence, the still auditory, disclosed in the disrelational ontology of language: a richness and complexity of that dramatic tension, the postlapsarian interplay between fallen time and fallen language; the key question is how not to sanitise, fetishise and economise on the dialogic inadequacy of the other, of the dumb foreigner in us. Silence, thus approached as a universal speech act, as the inclusive preclusion of the word across time, space and cultures, is more specific, precise and resonant than quietude or muteness, the absence or eradication of sounds. Silence, thus understood, is then not a mystified non-language, a solipsistic disproof or disqualification of mediated communication but the language that is forever foreign. The originary force of silence, its speechless power is an evolutionary index to ethical dialogue, or rather dialogue as an ethical act. We, of we-are-the-world, should be able to communicate not in spite of, but through, silence.",

It is brought home to us how resistant to our understanding other people can be; we are forcefully reminded that another person's mental life is largely hidden from us. And we may well begin to wonder whether we can ever really know what someone else thinks and feels. After all, when we ascribe thoughts and feelings to another person, it seems that all we have by way of supporting evidence is what we observe, namely his external behaviour. But how can we know in the case of someone else which outward behaviour patterns are signs of which inner states? Perhaps the similarity of his behaviour to our own may lead us to conjecture that he thinks and feels as we do; but are we ever really entitled to be sure what is going on in his mind?",

      "abstract": "The living social reality was for Cooley the society of which he was a part, which he approached by objective introspection. Society is an affair of a consciousness that is necessarily social. The self is not a presupposition of consciousness but arises in communication and is dependent on others who are as immediate as the self. In imagination both self and other have their origin. Public consciousness is the organization of the separate individual experiences. The self is not an immediate character of the mind, for we are not first individual and then social; the mind itself arises through communication. This represents an advance on Baldwin, Tarde, and even James. A self that can reach other selves only through the interpretation of states of consciousness can never be primarily a social self. A difficulty arises when the parallelism of \"ordinary psychology\" is accepted by Cooley. His ethical views ignored primitive impulses and insisted on standards already established. He was not interested in the scientific study of society. But does not the self belong to an objective phase in the tendency to take the role of another? Cooley did not find selves and society arising in primitive processes of communication so that he could grasp their reality in early human behavior. His sociology was in a sense an account of the American community to which he belonged. The gospel of Jesus and democracy were of the essence of it. But if we carry back the social behavior to a point which antedates the psychical as distinct from an outer world, it is to this primitive behavior that one can trace the social patterns that produce society as well as to criticism and reconstruction. To this type of analysis Cooley's assumption closes the door. But Cooley's establishment of the self and others on the same plane of reality and his impressive study of the primary group are positive accomplishments for which we are profoundly indebted.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Problems of self-control as well as social cooperation may be seen as conflicts not between internal spiritual or neurological entities, but between highly valued overt behavioral patterns of differing temporal extents or social distances. For example, an alcoholic must choose between having a drink now—valuable in the short run—and being healthy, performing well at work, maintaining satisfying social relationships, etc. —valuable in the long run. The essential question addressed in this chapter is how the latter may come to dominate the former within a person's lifetime. A behavioral evolutionary process is proposed by which valuable temporally or socially extended behavior patterns evolve over an individual lifetime from simpler, shorter patterns. It is argued that complex patterns, such as social cooperation over long periods, arise from simpler patterns in behavioral evolution analogously to the way complex structures, such as the human eye, arise from simpler structures in biological evolution. The idea that complex, long-term behavioral patterns in conflict with short-term patterns, if they are not inherited in toto, must be generated by an internal and autonomous spiritual, neurological, or cognitive process is compared to creationism in biological evolution. The role of delay and social discount functions in measuring the extent of coherent behavioral patterns is explicated. Finally, the chapter examines several implications of teleological behaviorism for practical behavioral control.",

The hearing impaired person (or: the person who has a hearing deficiency) shares this deficiency with her surrounding, she also lives this experience deep within herself. Deafness brings together several disciplines, based on the biological, as well as, social and pedagogical approaches (aspects). This deficiency, which is often resented by others and is initially misunderstood, rubs off on the person who is affected and risks of demoralizing and discouraging her. Strengthening of the ego and personality development of the deaf as a whole autonomous person increases her self confidence and helps her build a solid identity. However, the question often asked: what is the identity of a deaf person? Hearing, deaf or bicultural? What is her future? Before getting any recognition from others, the deaf person needs to know herself. This return to oneself requires her to have knowledge of her own abilities, cultural background and an important feeling of security (a place among his people). The motivation for a better future is a prerequisite for a healthy and balanced development, both from the relational and mental domain. Under what conditions does the deaf person live? Is it framed, loved, recognized? Is it informed, directed, monitored? What image does she have of her own body? What factors from an early age are put into play? What image does she have of herself or what image do we reflect on her? Why? The type of equipment offered, cochlear implants or conventional hearing aid, do they play a role? In this study several factors are being explored; they deal with the problems and issues of the deaf person, the experiences of the person as having a hearing deficiency, the nature and severity of the condition that affects the person and also how this person perceives her own image, consequently her identity and her future.",

Their presence is haphazard; between their own illicit movement and the ongoing attempts to exclude them from public space and public life, they float in and out of social experience more than they inhabit it. Constructed as threats to social order and public decency, they return to haunt the lives of the more secure. To understand the ghostly dynamics of such people and groups, criminologists need methods attuned to uncertainty and absence—methods designed to engage with the presence of absence, and to distinguish between those not there, those no longer there, and those soon to disappear. Such methods must also orient criminologists to ghostly spaces: to temporal aftermaths, to residues and ruins, and to the interstitial shadows of social life. To embrace such methods, though, is not only to seek ghosts; it is to reject positivist methods and their mythologies of certainty, factuality, and predictability.",

No part of it is about ‘providing information’2 to anyone else. Confidentiality is very much a deontological virtue: it places a duty on one individual to another. And by this very focus on private interaction, it is honoured between individuals, and without consideration of the wider context, and despite the utility the private knowledge might have for others.\n\nThere are many good reasons to value confidentiality in medicine, in particular because it promotes trust between patient and doctor and allows fuller disclosure of the facts and context of an illness, which therefore allows fairer and more accurate assessment of symptoms and their meaning for the patient.

To be a human person includes both objectivity and subjectivity, both physicality and spirituality. A person is endowed with the capacity for rational activity. As such, every person is endowed with the capacity for self-reflection and interiority. human person is a synthesis of two poles. On the one hand, every human person is always situated in one’s physicality, in a particular environment, at a particular time and place, in a specific cultural milieu. On the other hand, every human person is endowed with the capacity to gain a critical distance from one’s situation, to become self-aware, to reflect, and to become detached, taking up a stance over against one’s position in the world. Each of these two capacities, the ability to be immersed in the here-and-now as well as the ability to gain a critical distance from one’s environment, is open to abuse. It is possible to throw oneself so completely into the moment, that one entirely neglects one’s capacity for transcendence, for interiority, and for critical detachment. In this inauthentic mode of existence, one acts as if one is merely part of the crowd, neglecting that one is an individual person. Gregory R.

      "abstract": "As Sir Thomas Browne solemnly observed in his Religio Medici , “Heresies perish not with their authors but, like the river Arethusa, though they have lost their currents in one place, they rise up in another.” So too with the economist's valuation of life, the heresy being that–without seriously challenging the current concept of subjective valuation of changes in risk–economists have regressed to the once-persistent belief that it bears some quantitative relation, if not to expected earnings, at least to the utility of expected earnings or capital or consumption. This old-tyme recipe for estimating the value of a human life – notwithstanding the ornate convolutions and occasional intellectual effronteries to be found in the more recent versions–is much like that for calculating the value of a two-week honeymoon for a loving couple by reference to their anticipated outlays (including foregone earnings) plus perhaps an allowance for the probability of non-consummation owing to frigidity in either.",

      "abstract": "The title “current trends” implies diversion from some known and established body or movement. In many ways, counselling psychology is still an unknown discipline in this Society and in Britain itself. In 1990, Ray Woolfe called it “an idea whose time has come” and went on to refer to the process as one of “an infant growing up”. Less encouragingly, there is a tendency for counselling psychology to be seen as a derivative compromise, without respectable historical roots within applied psychology, or a home for failed clinical psychologists. Counselling psychologists hotly dispute this myth, and have spent some energy in searching for clear definitions of their speciality. I should like to quote from Sheelagh Straw-bridge’s paper, presented at the Second Annual Conference of the (then) Special Group in Counselling Psychology (1991): “Counselling psychologists are not … professionals with knowledge to dispense, however caringly, on behalf of others … [but] in a process of coming to know, with another person, something of that other’s world”. It is difficult to avoid the temptation to define this new movement entirely by comparison with other established subsystems of psychology, psychotherapy or counselling. Such an approach can lead to defensive and somewhat aggressively phrased definitions, which rely implicitly on criticism of the “grown-up”, established organizations. Here, then, is my own attempt of a definition of the unique nature of counselling psychology in Britain.",

For example, some of us go to great lengths to carry out their final wishes. Given that the dead no longer exist, however, it seems that nothing can be good or bad for them: they lack prudential interests. In that case, it is hard to see how we could owe them anything. They seem to lack moral standing altogether. In this essay, I will rebut this line of thought. I will claim that in some cases things that happen after people die are indeed good or bad for them. Their interests can still be advanced or hindered, so the dead have moral standing.This article is part of the theme issue 'Evolutionary thanatology: impacts of the dead on the living in humans and other animals'.",

They are the means by which one organism gains some advantage to the detriment of another. No hint of genuine charity ameliorates our vision of society, once sentimental ism has been laid aside. What passes for co-operation turns out to be a mixture of opportunism and exploitation. The impulses that lead one animal to sacrifice himself for another turn out to have their ultimate rationale in gaining advantage over a third; and acts ‘for the good’ of one society turn out to be performed to the detriment of the rest. Where it is in his own interest, every organism may reasonably be expected to aid his fellows. Where he has no alternative, he submits to the yoke of communal servitude. Yet given a full chance to act in his own interest, nothing but expediency will restrain him from brutalizing, from maiming, from murdering-his brother, his mate, his parent or his child.

      "title": "Charity and the Social Order",
      "abstract": "CHARITY AND THE SOCIAL ORDER I. INTRODUCTION T HE QUEST of man for unity and order is the mainspring of all that is history. For tranquillity of order his wars have been waged; for order of mind his art and culture ebb and flow; for unity with the Deity, there are his religions, his churches, his homes, his schools. This search for unity springs from his very nature. As an individual . substance man is one, and the whole world about him must contribute to that oneness, else it is meaningless. As a rational creature endowed with an intellect whose work is the perception of relationships, man seeks unity in order, the stuff of which relationships are made. As a being endowed with free will, always acting for an ultimate end of his own choice, an end which gives unity and purposiveness to his acts, man puts order into his world of activity. This continual quest of order on the part of man is admirably illustrated, perhaps through sheer contrast, in that vastly complex and somewhat disordered thing called society, the broad realm of man's activities with his fellow creatures. More particularly we refer to such activities of men as are the objects of the social sciences-the relations of man to the material necessities upon which depends his livelihood, and his relations to the various groups to which, of choice or necessity, he and his fellow men belong. Order requires a certain unity, and unity derives from a principle--a common source, a radical oneness. Socio-economic relations being so manifestly complex, having neither the concreteness of the visible creation nor the absoluteness of the spiritual world, have always challenged the ingenuity of man to discover or invent principles of social order. Nor has man shirked the task. There is, for instance, the individualist prin539 540 LOUIS A. RYAN ciple of Herbert Spencer: \" Every man has freedom to do all that he wills, provided he infringes not the equal freedom of any other man.\" 1 The class principle finds this expression in Karl Marx: \" The economic structure of society is the real foundation on which rise legal and political superstructures and to which correspond definite forms of social consciousness.\" 2 Totalitarianism, as explained by Benito Mussolini, accepts the state as principle: \" Fascism conceives of the State as an Absolute, in comparison with which all individuals or groups are relative, only to be conceived in their relation to the State.\" 3 The racism of Hitler claims blood as the principle of social structure: \" All that is not race in this world is trash. All world historical events, however, are only the expression of the race's instinct of self-preservation in its good or in its evil meaning.\" 4 A very recent and even more universalist social philosophy enuntiates its principle in the name of democracy which \" is the plentitude of heart-service to a highest religion embodying the essence of all higher religions. Democracy is nothing more and nothing less than humanism in theocracy and rational theocracy in universal humanism.\" 5 More in the realm of reason is justice as the natural principle of society. It is stated thus by Aristotle: \"Since in every art and science the end aimed at is always good, so particularly in this, which is the most excellent of all, the founding of civil society, the good therein aimed at is justice; for it is this which is for the benefit of all.\" 6 Nor does the Catholic Church, with her theology and supernatural philosophy of living, fail to propose a fundamental principle for the social order. It is charity, love of neighbor. 1 H. Spencer, The Principles of Ethics (New York: 1897), II, 46. 2 K. Marx, The Critique of Political Economy (New York: 1904), p. 11. • B.

      "abstract": "Autonomy, self-legislating and self-determining individuality, is the foremost achievement of modernity and its despair. What looks like the essential structure of autonomy designates a movement of the will whereby if it is governed by anything other than itself alone it loses itself, it becomes heteronomous. Heteronomy refers to any determination of the will that governs it from without, where what is without, outside, other is simply what is not the will either metaphysically (essentially) or through the work of incorporation. Which is why attaining autonomy has meant either isolating the will, through doubt or conceptual refinement, from everything that could be considered, logically or actually, external to it in order that it might then be in a position to will only itself, its freedom; or, especially in political contexts, reclaiming for the will what originally belonged to or was produced by it but has become alienated or reified in opposition to it—what has become separated from it and come to rule it from without. Despite appearances to the contrary, this latter move equally requires the isolation of the will from its products, even if they are truly morally or metaphysically its, since unless there is a means of identifying the will as intrinsically my or our will, unless the will has a specifiable character and integrity apart from what it wills, then there will be nothing for its products to stand over and against, overwhelm, dominate, and control. Autonomy depends upon locating, above all through the self-reflective self-purification of sceptical doubt, some essential characterization of the will in order that its true, legitimate and rightful, scope and provenance with respect to what lies outside it can be established.",

      "abstract": "Fun is often understood to be non-conceptual and indeed without rigour, without relation to formal processes of thought, yielding an intense and joyous informality, a release from procedure. Yet, as this book argues, fun may also be found, alongside other kinds of pleasure, in the generation, iteration and imagination of operations and procedures. This chapter aims to develop a means of drawing out an understanding of fun in relation to concepts of experience in the culture of mathematics and in the machinic fun of certain computer games. Mathematical concepts of experience, as something to be effaced, in terms of the grind of churning out calculations, understood as an acme of human knowledge bordering on the mystical or something both prosaic, peculiar and thrillingly abstract have been crucial to the motivation and genesis of computing. Experience may be figured as something innate to the computing person, or that is abstractable and thus mobile, shifting heterogeneously from one context to another, producing strange affinities between scales – residues and likeness among computational forms that can occasionally link the most austere and mundane or cacophonous of aesthetics. Among such, the fine and perplexing fun of paradox and ambiguity arises not simply in the interplay between formalisms and other kinds of life but as formalisms interweave releasing and congealing further dynamics. There are many ways in which mathematics has been linked to culture as a means of ordering, describing, inspiring or explaining ways of being in the world, but it is less often that mathematics thinks about itself as producing figurations of existence, and such moments are useful to turn to in gaining a sense of some of the patternings of computational culture.",

This is different from the popular view which regards happiness as the achievement of wealth, reputation, fame, or honour. From a Daoist perspective, being connected with one's innate nature paves the way to developing one's potentiality and creativity fully, and thus to reaching an ideal, or even unexpected, perfect outcome in an effortless and spontaneous manner. In Daoist religion, happiness can be achieved through an inward-seeking experience of oneness or unity between oneself and the source of the universe, e.g. the Dao, through cultivation-orientated meditation. In contrast with Confucianism, which emphasises the importance of collective happiness above that of the individual, Daoism focuses on individual happiness and wellbeing. Yet, Daoism still suggests that wellbeing requires an individual not only to take care of their own health and personal cultivation, but that this is a prerequisite for having a good relationship with others in society.",

The terms, admirable, excellent, superlatively great, wise, and holy; these sufficiently fill the imaginations of men; and anything beyond, besides that it leads into absurdities, has no influence on the affections or sentiments. Thus, in the present subject, if we abandon all human analogy, as seems your intention, Demea, I am afraid we abandon all religion, and retain no conception of the great object of our adoration. If we preserve human analogy, we must forever find it impossible to reconcile any mixture of evil in the universe with infinite attributes; much less, can we ever prove the latter from the former. But supposing the author of nature to be finitely perfect, though far exceeding mankind; a satisfactory account may then be given of natural and moral evil, and every untoward phenomenon be explained and adjusted. A less evil may then be chosen, in order to avoid a greater: Inconveniences be submitted to, in order to reach a desirable end: And in a word, benevolence, regulated by wisdom, and limited by necessity, may produce just such a world as the present.",

      "abstract": "Abstract This chapter suggests that while the things of the home are clearly the terminus of consumption culture, these and the home are also active sources of imaginative life. Living at home is more than a survival strategy and should be more than a dumping ground of consumption practices; the art and craft of the home are what make a house and its belongings a home, and what make a home a way of living. In both its design and furnishings, and in the practice of home-life, the home can be more than the mastering of necessities; it can be a realm of freedom. It need not be the unavoidable target of consumption culture and its enslaving devices, but rather a \"domestic refuge\" for the practice of life. The thing-stories of a home may be acts of creation, and one criterion in considering possessions and the question of materialism is whether the things and their thing-stories are in the end mere property indicators, or whether they can act as means and embodiments of self-creation through the practice of the art and craft of the home.",

      "abstract": "A series of 8-12 pieces of printed fabric, which are cut to the exact size of yoga mats, are arranged on a large open area of floor. The mats suggest possible use (i.e. exercise) while at the same time functioning as platforms for small collections of purpose-made objects which resemble body parts and yoga/exercise paraphernalia. These collections of parts resemble tools, limbs and artifacts. They might appear to enable certain types of activity, in the way that a yoga block might invite a certain type of yoga position, but they are also of course simply discrete sculptural objects. These units, i.e. the ‘mats’ and the other elements that they display, are both objects and subjects. The mats allude to human bodies and serve as supports for non-human bodies.\r\n\r\nThe series of mats and accompanying objects will be placed and removed according to the availability of the space (sometimes occupied by chairs/church service). The work will act as a temporal event. It’s this durational aspect that pushes them more towards the space of performance and event, liveness. The work will appear and disappear, ebb/flow in sync with the day-to-day use of the shared multifunctional space. As such the work makes use of gaps in time and space, and while there’s a sinister aspect to this sort of occupying of seemingly empty time/space with productivity (especially productivity which relates in part to the optimized performance of the body), there’s also an element of gymnastic adaptation, a pragmatic and nomadic approach to inhabiting space and through this there’s a desire to find spaces within existing structures where one can exist, where one can do as one pleases.\r\n\r\nThe mats might collectively allude to a social group, a body, individual bodies and the group’s body – a body that will be taken care of by Matthew Wang. Matthew will place and clear away the mats at regular intervals, with direction from myself. Some of the objects will need to be fabricated on site, and their fragile nature will determine the necessarily delicate and deliberate movements of the person who’s responsible for handling them during the period of the exhibition.\r\n\r\nTitle: 'Who's There?'\r\nDetails: dimensions variable (c/a W700 x L700 x H50cm).

I argue that these open documents or undocuments are the site, or at least a site, through which the motley crew or something like it might be reproduced and extended. I explore their reconfigurations of reproduction, as a sexual, but not necessarily heterosexual or even biological process.

      "abstract": "Rather less than a century ago Morelli began a revolution in art-historical method by demonstrating that every painter has his formulae for rendering details—ears, eyes, hands, drapery-folds and so on—amounting to a personal system; and that, for attribution, a study of these minutiae affords a valuable check on, if not a sounder basis than, a general sense of style; or rather that the two together form the only sound basis. There is no rule of thumb. Formulae are the artist's servants, not his masters. They appear and vanish, change and merge, according to the development of his technique and style, the influences he undergoes, the speed at which he is working, all the circumstances of his art; but in much of any painter's work they will be found recurring; rarely, as a system, in another's. Morellian method can only be effectively used by one who, like Morelli himself, is sensitive to works of art not only as aesthetic achievements but as expressions of personality; but without the tools of his forging it is impossible for sensitivity alone to make much headway. The study of Italian painting before Morelli was a chaos of unchecked traditions and conflicting hunches. Despite fine work by Hartwig, Furtwängler and others, the study of red-figure vase-painting remained much the same (without the traditions) until Beazley brought to it a rare combination of sensitivity to personal artistic style with Morellian discipline.",

This is true in so far as a large number of people like to think of themselves as intellectuals. Intellectuals may, paradoxically, perhaps be distinguished less by their intellectual opinions than by their emotional attitudes. They often described themselves as people whose primary concern was with truth and with knowledge, who regarded thought as the most superior form of activity, and who held disinterestedness, originality, and critical power in the highest esteem. But precisely because they have been so critical, they have not spared themselves, and every one of these definitions has been attacked by them. They have been in disagreement amongst themselves on almost every subject. However, they have, despite their search for originality, generally shared three characteristics of personality. They have been above all self-conscious, and life for them has had two parts — experience and meditation on experience — with the latter usually taking more time than the former; almost invariably this has meant that they have been personally ill at ease in the world. Secondly, they have been people who have been unable to tolerate the contradictions of life: they have devoted themselves to resolving contradictions and to reducing complexity into simplifications. They have been inventors and adepts of systems and formulae. But they have been more than just followers of a religion or a creed, because, thirdly, they have not normally been concerned simply with their own salvation or welfare, and they have sought solutions of universal scope, and of an abstract nature, applicable to all men.",

There are, no doubt, people who have no goal at all beyond the moment's pleasure or release from pain. There may be people incapable of reaching any reasoned decision about what to do, and acting on it. But anyone who asks how she should live implicitly agrees that her goal is to live well, to live a life that she can think worth living. That goal, eudaimonia , is something that is sought for its own sake, and for nothing else. Anyone who asks herself how she should live can answer that she should live well. The answer, admittedly, needs further comment. Aristotle went on to suggest that ‘living well’ amounted to living in accordance with virtue, or if there is more than one virtue, in accordance with the best and most complete. Eudaimonia , happiness, is virtuous activity over a whole life. To live a worthwhile life we must acquire and practice habits of doing the right thing, for the right reason. Equivalently, we must do what a virtuous person would, and in the way she would, for the sake of to kalon , or beauty.",

      "title": "Staging for Success: Preparing Environments for Productive Meetings, Trainings, and Workshops",
      "abstract": "Physical environment and people Physical settings can create cognitive and emotional reactions in people. In fact, many disciplines, including human ecology and environmental psychology, assert that environmental variables have an impact on human behavior. In ecological psychology, for instance, when the quality of the fit between human occupants and the physical environment is high, the people and the place are unified. Research on the restorative effects of the natural environment found that individuals report feeling rejuvenated and energized by the places that they occupy. Additionally, research on creativity suggests that people confined to a “featureless environment” do not perform to potential intellectually and emotionally. Environmental variables that may affect human behavior include the lack or the expansiveness of space; the location, shape, or temperature of a room; the texture and color of the walls and flooring; and the type and arrangement of furniture. Environmental variables may also include the absence or presence of natural lighting, windows with scenic views, and music or sounds that may be calming or distracting. Odors (e.g., the scent of flowers) may also conjure up images or set the mood in a given environment. Strong odors such as garbage, incense, strong perfume, or cologne may be distracting or off-putting. A person’s mood, attention span, and ability to focus may also be affected by color. For example, colors have the power to affect human senses by conveying meaning and presenting an atmosphere of pleasantness. Specifically, the cooler colors (blues, greens, and grays) create more passive participation, or a sense of coldness, while warm colors (such as reds and yellows) or light pastels tend to give a sense of warmth. From an environmental psychology perspective, extreme temperatures can reduce interpersonal attraction and interfere with successful task performance. For example, a study on hot and crowded areas found that participants in a room at normal temperature (72.4°F) reported feeling vigorous and comfortable, whereas individuals assigned to an overheated room (93.5°F) reported feelings of discomfort, fatigue, and sadness. High temperatures are also linked to loss of attention and productivity, and group members tend to be more aggressive when they are hot.",

      "abstract": "A car that can drive itself or a robot that can help with a wide variety of functions ranging from tedious housekeeping to dangerous military flight operations is the stuff of science fiction. Today's robots certainly make certain tasks easier but they are still incapable of functioning effectively for long periods in real-world scenarios (as opposed to controlled environments) without explicit human involvement [l, 2]. Robots that are intelligent need to be able to interact autonomously with objects in their surroundings [3]. This autonomous interaction involves three steps: (1) detecting the presence of the object [4], (2) recognizing the object—figuring out what type of interaction to have with it, and (3) tracking the trajectory of the object—determining how and when to react to it [4]. \r\nWhile these steps are computationally difficult, humans and many other living creatures are able to perform them easily. They are able to rapidly and effortlessly identify and categorize diverse objects in cluttered scenes under widely varying viewing conditions, such as changes in position, rotation and illumination [5]. Engineered systems are unable to match the level of proficiency and speed of biological visual systems. \r\nThrough this thesis, we move towards the development of an autonomous, continuous-time visual system that emulates visual information processing in the primate visual cortex. This multi-stage system will utilize large-scale arrays of identical silicon neurons to build a biologically-plausible model of its biological counterpart. In particular, we have made advances in three areas. \r\nFirst, we have designed a neural array transceiver, the platform on which we intend to implement artificial cortex. This transceiver utilizes the Mihalas-Niebur neuron model, a generalized model of the leaky integrate-and-fire neuron with adaptive threshold, which is capable of producing most of the known spiking and bursting patterns of cortical neurons [6]. Ours is the first circuit implementation of the model and we have demonstrated many of the expected spiking patterns. \r\nSecond, we implemented silicon facsimiles of cortical simple and complex cells according to the hierarchical model of object recognition in primate visual cortex proposed by Riesenhuber and Poggio [7]. We showed that the tuning and MAX computations at the V1-V2N4 stages of processing can be performed with integrate-and-fire neurons. \r\nFinally, we designed a neuromorphic cross-correlation engine, the first in neural hardware, for object detection. This is based on the work of Jonathan Tapson which suggests that correlation information can be obtained from the Interspike Interval Histogram (ISIH) of a spiking neuron [8]. On the cross-correlation engine, we were able to detect the auto and cross-correlation of signals as a mechanism for finding the content of information within the signal. \r\nIn addition, we explored neural implementations of Kalman filtering as an object tracking mechanism and obtained encouraging preliminary results. In future, these functionalities—detection, recognition, and tracking—will be implemented on one or more neural arrays working together cohesively to produce a system with a potentially more intelligent artificial visual cortex.",

Management of sport is an extreme case, on the base of which we can proof creativity of management and managers. 2. We face the contradiction of cultures not because of their difference but because of their uniformity and anaemia, i. e. morbidity when colourful details conflict after their contents assimilate. 3. A good piece of work threatens to overstep the limits of the rational (cultural) region and to stay not understandable; these characteristics follow from its ungovernable nature and are the components of a good piece of art. 4. As a limit of culture, nature allows for a creator loosing a touch with his (her) creative whole that is to be overstepped constantly; sport is appealing to the nature. 5. Adventures, ventures, long distant tours and extreme sport disturb work and distract a creator by threatening not as much with physical dangers as with unrealized ideas; creation is donkeywork by distancing from external disturbs. 6. The body in sport and the creation are inseparable. 7. Being sport fans, we not only simulate creativity but also create our identity, life style and life art; beside this, we touch the creativity nourished in a social way through our identity and social capital.",

Both are seen as innate to humans, yet scarce because of lack of opportunity and lack of cultivation, as well as lack of talent or \"genius.\" Charisma as well as play is related to vital processes and is transcendent, featuring the extra-ordinary. Charisma and play are contrasted with the routine and reject it. Separateness and segregation are inherent in charisma and play; yet both become routinized, stylized, institutionalized. The elaborate and complex nature of these concepts is illustrated by exam ining a study of wilderness-camping in which qualities of experience are expressed that can be derived from the ele ments of charisma and play. These qualities are more readily experienced by persons who are trained to experience them; most leisure-activities are not felt to be so moving or touching, and outdoor recreation as well as the rest of the activities which occupy us during our free time are not usually endowed with transcendent qualities.",

It is posed in various idioms all the time by people in various walks of life. If that makes them all philosophers, then that is a conclusion I am happy to embrace. It becomes a question for ethics, I think, not only when we ask the personal question, what makes my own life bearable, but when we ask, from a position of power, and from the point of view of distributive justice, what makes, or ought to make, the lives of others bearable? Somewhere in the answer we find ourselves not only committed to a certain view of what life is, and what it should be, but also of what constitutes the human, the distinctively human life, and what does not. There is always a risk of anthropocentrism here, if one assumes that the distinctively human life is valuable, or most valuable, or the only way to think of the problem of value. But perhaps to counter that tendency it is necessary to ask both the question of life, and the question of the human, and not to let them fully collapse into one another.",

Later for the Greeks it came to mean “the pursuit of knowledge” or “a way of enquiry” (literally “way of pursuit”). For us moderns it has a wider usage. The Oxford English Dictionary tells us that a method is a way of doing something in accordance with a plan, or a special procedure; or it is a regular systematic way of either treating a person or attaining a goal. It is also a systematic or orderly arrangement of topics, discourses or ideas. In general one can speak of a method for gutting and filleting fish, baking a cake, wiring a fuse box, surveying a given piece of landscape, conducting a funeral or cracking a safe. Not following the prescribed method usually leads to a botched, or socially unacceptable, outcome. There are also methods for teaching languages, for example, the immersion method; there are methods for teaching the violin to the very young, for example, the Suzuki method; there are methods for learning and playing curling, or a nose flute; and so on. In general there are methods whereby one can not only best teach or learn a given subject, but also present an effective case in a law court, write up a report, conduct an orchestra or a meeting, and so on.",

      "abstract": "Abstract The purpose of this paper is to examine with some care the little snippets of ritual used in everyday encounters between people, expressions like good morning, or thank you, or God bless you said when someone sneezes, or bye-bye said to an infant by a departing guest. All human speech communities have such formulas, although their character and the incidence of their use may vary enormously from one society to another. Strangely enough this universal phenomenon has been very little studied by linguists or anthropologists or other students of human behaviour. These politeness formulas (as I call them) are, in the word of Erving Goffman, ‘among the most conventionalized and perfunctory doings we engage in and traditionally have been treated by students of modem society as part of the dust of social activity, empty and trivial’ (Goffman 1971: 90). Goffman, in his intentionally irritating way, seems to attribute our failure to study these interpersonal rituals to the general decline of religion in modem times. He says, ‘Only our secular view of society prevents us from appreciating the ubiquitousness and strategy of their location, and, in tum, their role in social organization’ (89). Without in any way accepting his explanation for the dearth of systematic study of politeness formulas, I join him in bewailing it, and find in his works some of the most insightful treatments of them.",

However throughout his published works there are numerous references to the phenomenon. In this presentation I will make use of these scattered references to articulate a Dabrowskian theory of the developmental function of loss. Briefly the theory is as follows. Those who possess psychic overexcitability (especially of the emotional and imaginational kinds) develop intense attachments to the significant persons in their lives, with the consequence that when they sustain a loss of one of these significant persons, their mourning is correspondingly intense. This intense mourning can result in one or another form of dysfunctional behaviour, the production of creative works, or personality development. In some cases, e.g., Michelangelo, all three are found in the same person.",

In everyday usage, autonomy implies freedom from outside control or self- government. Agents capable of behaviour may be controlled entirely by outside agents. The problem in designing autonomous robots is to deploy a compromise between decision making by rules and decision making by cognition. Because there will be many dimensions involved, it may be possible to rely on rules in some situations and planning in others. When an automaton, whether animal or robot, is in a particular state it obeys a particular behavioural rule. The consequences of behaviour are of three main types: those that alter the state of the robot itself, those that alter the robots environment, and those that are irrelevant. Robots designed to carry out a particular task, such as laying bricks, would probably be designed to monitor other state variables pertaining to the task.",

Although behaviourism is no longer the pre-eminent force it once was within psychology, it is still claimed to be — together with its many offshoots and variants — the most objective and scientific approach within the subject, as it concerns itself not with the accounts people give of their own states of mind, but with observations of what they actually do (that is, of their behaviour). It shows little interest in the mechanisms that psychodynamic and humanistic psychology see as underlying personality. The problem with such things, behaviourists have traditionally argued, is that they are based largely on speculation rather than on the structured observation that characterises all good science. It is impossible to observe directly the unconscious processes postulated by Freud and others (or even to test their workings directly, as it is possible to do with qualities such as learning and remembering). Even the concept of personality traits is seen as being of value only if such traits are assessed by questionnaires designed to reveal how people typically behave in various key situations.",

      "abstract": "In his introduction, Frankfurter states the ambitious goal of redirecting modern studies of magic from the etic (where what constitutes magic is determined by the modern author) to the emic (where it is the ancient cultures being studied that decide what rituals are unsanctioned or illegitimate). His constituent ancient world is centered mainly on Mediterranean countries and includes Greek, Roman, Jewish, Mesopotamian, Persian, and Egyptian cultures, ranging in time from c. 2000 BCE to the Byzantine Christian period. Topics taken up include how these ancient cultures themselves describe such practices, if they do so at all; the ritual materials (spells, amulets, drugs, magic bowls, images, and manuals); and the social contexts in which such rituals occur. While all of these ancient societies engaged in practices to control human events—to foresee or alter the future, to ward off harm, to compel certain behaviors in others, or to reanimate the dead—they differ in how such practices were viewed. In Egypt, for example, heka (often translated as “magic”) is the binding force of the universe, which might be used for good or ill but which required a corps of skilled practitioners to access it. Under Roman rule, such practitioners were condemned. In Mesopotamia, diagnosis of disease might belong to the technical skill of divination, while Greeks set it off as medicine. Similarly, pharmacology might fall into the class of medicine when prescribed by a doctor, but as “magic” when prescribed by a local healer (who more often than not was a woman). What emerges is that ancient “magic” was protean, labile, and culturally contingent, but “magic” rituals display remarkable sameness, whether as the result of simple human nature or of intercultural exchange.",

In the context of animal welfare, cascades have often occurred, and more consequential ones are possible. First: In this domain, preference falsification has run and is running rampant. Those who care about animal welfare, or are inclined to want to say or do something about it, often silence themselves. They know that if they speak or act, they might incur social disapproval or worse. Second: People have different thresholds for disclosing their views or for taking action. With respect to animal welfare, some people really will speak out or act, even if no one else does. Others need someone to follow – but only one. Still others need two, or three, or a hundred, or more. Third: Social interactions are and continue to be crucial to the movement for animal welfare. Who is seeing whom? When? Who is talking to whom? Are visible people speaking and acting in ways that support animal welfare? Are they credible? With whom? Fourth: In many times and places, believers in animal rights, animal welfare, or both have created communities of like-minded people. These communities can be highly effective. They create a commitment to a belief that might have been held tentatively. They make that belief salient, potentially part of people’s identity. They increase confidence and unity.",

It should be emphasized that vision in its broadest sense includes visual acuity, the extent of the fields of vision, the normality or abnormality of binocular vision, and the adequacy of the visual associations such as recognition, identification and memory. It seems superfluous point out that excellent visual acuity, if seen through a gun barrel, is by no means satisfying. Also, that a full, wide field of vision, when the object of interest is blurred, is most unsatisfactory. Having two eyes, each of which is a perfect unit, but not seeing together and comfortably, is most annoying and handicapping. Finally, referring back the brain a perfect visual image, which cannot be properly recognized and identified and then correlated with similar images previously received, is a totally frustrating experience. Thus, for a child to see well he must see clearly the thing he looks straight at, he must see widely the things about him, as as the object of interest, he must have his two eyes properly co-ordinated, and he must be able recognize, identify and associate this image with related images and activities of the past.",

      "abstract": "Abstract An unorthodox view of the function of primary process is presented with a view to enlarge, rather than diminish Freudian assumptions. One of the basic tenets of Freudian hypothesis was the supposed lack of influence of outside experience upon primary process functions. Yet we see demonstrated on a daily basis that primary process cognition is at work in any human interaction or experience. The mental structures of the self in interaction with the nonself is constantly monitored, added to, or subtracted from during contact with others. It is a prereflective mode that does not immediately rise into awareness. We give meaning to all interactions without necessarily reflecting upon them or even clarifying them to ourselves. Without allowing for such meaning to be integrated, we would lose or misinterpret large portions of our daily interactions. Flaws in communication occur every day and are demonstrable particularly in therapy when therapists are not attuned to their patients' emotional needs. It is demonstrated that nonverbal avoidance behavior of disturbed infants is the precursor for disturbed object relations of adults. Therefore, it makes no sense to interpret unconscious meanings—there are none. The difficulty lies in the inter-subjective realm and serves defensive modes. However, if patients present an inauthentic self, it is often difficult to decide if one is indeed in the presence of such a maimed self. The therapist's countertransference aids in detecting inaulhenticity. Ever-present, unconscious meaning analysis must be brought into consciousness by the therapist in order to further the therapeutic process.",

      "title": "Practicing the Religious Self: Buddhist-Christian Identity as Social Artifact",
      "abstract": "Practicing the Religious Self: Buddhist-Christian Identity as Social Artifact Duane R. Bidwell It is somewhat paradoxical to write or speak about identity formation in two religious traditions that ultimately deny the reality of any identity that we might claim or fashion for ourselves. In the Christian traditions, a person’s true (or ultimate) identity is received through God’s action and grace in baptism; to foreground any other facet of the self, or to anchor identity in anything but baptism, could be considered a form of idolatry. In the Buddhist traditions human identity is empty, woven not from an inherent or externally granted essence but through the interdependent arising of all things; 1 to cling to self and to identity as independent, enduring, immutable, or autonomous signals a mistaken understanding of reality.2 Indeed, as religious scholar Alice Keefe has written, “belief in the self as independent and self-existent is our fundamental delusion and root poison.” 3 Yet day by day most of us experience our identities, including our religious, cultural, and social identities, as neither empty nor erased. On the contrary: they seem to be inscribed with enduring meaning. Knowledge has been chiseled into them through our participation in the rituals and relationships of the world. At times the very fullness of our identities can feel on the verge of overflowing. This sense of dynamic presence and fullness causes our identities to serve as important (and perhaps essential) tools for negotiating the hurly-burly of experience and relationship in the mundane, finite, material world.4 From this perspective, our religious identities are social artifacts, entities and meanings formed in between, or on the margins of, biological selves that are related to one another through communities of practice.5 These communal artifacts may then be interiorized by individuals as resources that can be employed in or offered back to the world—performed, if you will—through particular (and sometimes disciplined) practices.6 The primacy of social process in creating and maintaining religious identity implies that community remains central to the process of fashioning the religious self in contemporary Buddhist and Christian practice. If this is true, it raises, of course, important questions about our understandings of ecclesiology and the nature of the sangha, theological anthropology and Buddhist understandings of the person. These questions [End Page 3] deserve to be answered, but they are too broad to be addressed here. My more modest intention is to contribute to generative conversation about religious identity formation by illustrating how my own religious identities as Buddhist and Christian have been practiced and performed as social artifacts in two particular instances. In a secondary sense, this essay serves as a reflection on pastoral work in a multifaith context, something “much needed in the Buddhist-Christian studies milieu.” 7 Given the diverse academic approaches to Buddhist-Christian studies, it seems wise to begin by describing my own background and approach. By training I am a pastoral theologian, someone who seeks to understand critically the richness and complexity of human experiences and then to respond with appropriate, faithful, and effective acts of care. The psychological meta-theory of social constructionism serves as a primary conversation partner for my work; it invites me to ask “not what goes on ‘inside’ people, but what people go on inside of.” 8 For pragmatic reasons I tend to utilize David Tracy’s mutual critical (or revised) correlational method,9 and in the dialectic between understanding human experience and responding to it, I privilege liberationist theologies and religio-ethical norms of justice, love, and wisdom. My practice as a spiritual director and pastoral counselor seeks to promote practices of freedom for all people.10 As a minister in the Presbyterian Church (USA) I am accountable to the Reformed tradition of Christian theology. My formal theological education occurred in the ecumenical context of a divinity school affiliated with the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) and at a diocesan seminary affiliated with the contemplative Anglican tradition. My informal training in Buddhist philosophy and practice occurred in the Theravada traditions of Southeast Asia, primarily through five years of participation in an immigrant congregation and weekly study with Thich Phap Nhan, a Vietnamese monk...",

      "abstract": "Unlike those readers who passionately describe Anzaldua \naccording to such categories, as, say, Chicana lesbian, tejana queer, or \nfeminist, I’m sometimes tempted to swing to the other extreme: to \nentirely reject all labels and describe her in unmarked terms—as \n“author,” “philosopher,” “theorist,” or “creative writer.” Yet to \nexclusively describe her in unmarked ways is really no better than \nlocking her into very specific identity categories, for to do so ignores \nthose times and texts where Anzaldua embraces the labels and selfdefines \nvery specifically, as Chicana and/or feminist and/or lesbian, and \nso on. Welcome to my dilemma. The labels generally used to describe \nAnzaldua are too limited, but they are not entirely incorrect. I can neither \nreject nor embrace them. And so I wonder: how can I describe Anzaldua \nin ways that acknowledge her groundbreaking work in identity-related \nfields without freezing her into these identities which she herself \nquestioned and (at least sometimes) outgrew? This is my unresolved \ndilemma and what this paper is about.",

So a sociologist can write, ‘If we are able to speak of real tradition, we must find the past spontaneously taken into account as the meaning of the present, without any discontinuity of social time, and without any consideration of the past as irrelevant’ (M. Dufrenne, quoted by P. Congar, Tradition and Traditions , p. 264, n. 1). ‘If democracy’, wrote Chesterton, ‘means that I give a man a vote even though he is my chauffeur, tradition means that I give a man a vote even though he is my great-great-grandfather’. What is handed on, however, is not existence of a purely biological kind, to remain always what it has been or to change very slowly over a space of aeons. Except in primitive tribes even tradition is not simply passed on as something static and timeless, and it is received by men who, though themselves in time, are not totally time-bound or restricted by what they receive. They believe themselves to be capable of significant action which is more than the repetition and reproduction of what has gone before. They are able to grasp a span of time and to call it history; they believe themselves to have a history, and they write history.",

He would probably have said something along the lines of: “I didn't really have time to think about it. I simply reacted. It felt right. I think anybody else would have done the same thing.” While the drama and seriousness of that particular scenario is not an everyday occurrence, the act of unreflectively doing something because it “feels right” is fairly commonplace. Such simple acts of kindness as giving a homeless person some spare change, giving a stranger directions, or helping someone up who has fallen on an icy pavement don't generally involve careful reflection and analysis. Instead, they seem to involve a feeling, perhaps of sympathy, empathy, care, or an unidentifiable sense of the “right thing to do,” and a corresponding action that seems to flow automatically.",

      "title": "Beyond the Tools of the Trade: Heidegger and the Intelligibility of Everyday Things",
      "abstract": "Abstract In everyday life, we constantly encounter and deal with useful things without pausing to inquire about the sources of their intelligibility. In Div. I of Being and Time , Heidegger undertakes just such an inquiry. According to a common reading of Heidegger's analysis, the intelligibility of our everyday encounters and dealings with useful things is ultimately constituted by practical self‐understandings (such as being a gardener, shoemaker, teacher, mother, musician, or philosopher). In this paper, I argue that while such practical self‐understandings may be sufficient to constitute the intelligibility of the tools and equipment specific to many practices, these “tools of the trade” are only a small portion of the things we encounter, use, and deal with on a daily basis. Practical self‐understandings cannot similarly account for the intelligibility of the more mundane things—like toothbrushes and sidewalks—used in everyday life. I consider whether an anonymous self‐understanding as “one,” “anyone,” or “no one in particular” — das Man —might play this intelligibility‐constituting role. In examining this possibility, another type of self‐understanding comes to light: cultural identities. I show that the cultural identities into which we are “thrown,” rather than practical identities or das Man , constitute the intelligibility of the abundance of mundane things that fill our everyday lives. Finally, I spell out how this finding bears on our understanding of Heidegger's notion of authenticity.",

In order to emphasize, face, or sustain this change, drugs, especially designer drugs, are frequently used.

      "abstract": "In order to explain the idea that sacrifice involves voluntary diminution of the agent’s well-being, “well-being” must be explained. The thesis that an agent’s well-being just consists in the occurrence of events wanted is rejected. Overvold replaces it by the view that the motivating desires involve the existence of the agent, alive, at the time of their satisfaction. This view seems counterintuitive. The whole desire-satisfaction theory is to be rejected partly because we dont’t think an event worthwile if it is not liked when it occurs, and partly because the theory cannot give a sensible account of what is good for an individual when his desires change. A more satisfactory view is that the goodness of an event for a person is fixed by his total gratifications as a result of its occurrence, provided they would occur if the person were fully informed about facts knowledge of which would change them if it existed. But self-sacrifice seems to involve not only voluntary diminution of well-being in this sense, but belief that the action is taken for the benefit of someone else. Overvold’s view leaves open the possibility that acting morally is never contrary to self-interest, if one of the agent’s major interests is that he act morally. This is an ingenious suggestion, but seems a bit counterintuitive.",

      "title": "Solidarity or objectivity?",
      "abstract": "There are two principal ways in which reflective human beings try, by placing their lives in a larger context, to give sense to those lives. The first is by telling the story of their contribution to a community. This community may be the actual historical one in which they live, or another actual one, distant in time or place, or a quite imaginary one, consisting perhaps of a dozen heroes and heroines selected from history or fiction or both. The second way is to describe themselves as standing in immediate relation to a nonhuman reality. This relation is immediate in the sense that it does not derive from a relation between such a reality and their tribe, or their nation, or their imagined band of comrades. I shall say that stories of the former kind exemplify the desire for solidarity, and that stories of the latter kind exemplify the desire for objectivity. Insofar as a person is seeking solidarity, she does not ask about the relation between the practices of the chosen community and something outside that community. Insofar as she seeks objectivity, she distances herself from the actual persons around her not by thinking of herself as a member of some other real or imaginary group, but rather by attaching herself to something which can be described without reference to any particular human beings.",

In addition to the medical/\r\ntechnical aspects, there are legal, moral, ethical, economic, logistical and humanitarian aspects. Each of these\r\naspects may have some peculiarity related to the donor and recipient. This paper deals primarily with the moral,\r\nethical and humanitarian aspects of the issue. From the viewpoint of Islam, organ transplantation is an acceptable\r\ntherapeutic value provided the following criteria are fulfilled:\r\n1. There is no other equally effective therapeutic solution available that is simpler, safer and/or more cost\r\neffective.\r\n2. The organ donation does not result in any harm to the donor\r\n3. The organ donation is done with the free will and full approval of the donor, or in the case of an unconscious\r\ndonor, or an organ donation taken from a cadaver, the approval of the next of kin or legal guardian.\r\n4. In the case of the donation of a single organ upon which the life of the donor depends, e.g., the heart or liver,\r\nthe organ may not be removed from the donor until the donor’s brain stem death is ascertained.\r\n5. The donated organ is a gift and is not sold.\r\n6. If the transaction results in material or monetary gain to the donor or to the donor’s family, the gain must\r\nnot be in the form of price, but the donor or his/her family may accept a gift as a token of appreciation since\r\nthe donated organ is considered a gift to the recipient.\r\n7.

      "abstract": "This paper presents a framework for a mobile robot guide, which provides the human with the flexibility to decide upon the way he wants to be guided. During the guiding process at any instant, the exploratory nature of the human, the social behavior and the individual's desires contribute to the position of the person with respect to the robot. For a robot to behave socially, it should not expect that the human will always follow the exact trajectory of the robot or will always maintain a fixed distance with robot. Depending upon the human's will and desire, he can choose either to accompany or to follow the robot during the guiding. To give more privilege to human, robot should also not expect that human will always support the guiding. Human may temporarily suspend the joint commitment of guiding process, due to other interesting tasks and may completely abandon the path expected by robot. Also sometimes the structure of the environment could enforce separation or hide the human. As a ‘social’ guide, robot should not only tolerate human diverse behavior but also try to adapt its path to support the human activity as well as influence the human path towards the goal. It should take appropriate decisions about when, where and how to deviate, as the very frequent or unnatural maneuvers of robot will make the human feel uncomfortable. In this paper we present a framework of monitoring and adapting to the human commitment on the joint task, and carrying out appropriate and goal oriented re-engagement attempts, if required, from the view point of guiding.",

Animal signals are limited and inflexible, but they are precise and unlikely to be misconstrued (Ardrey 1970). The human animal is often unaware that his actions, gestures and expressions are telling their own clear story — they are the outward signals of inner attitudes and tensions. Man concentrates so hard on his words that he often seems to forget that the coded messages from his body can be either contradicting or confirming the words from his mouth. It is as if two languages are being spoken simultaneously: the familiar verbal messages and transmissions from the subconscious which are often visible rather than audible.

This negative idea does little to help us live with dementia, never mind die with it. A social disability model allows us to consider the plight in a different way.

      "abstract": "Dying is strikingly private and personal, and it breaks the interconnectedness of all human life. It is at such a time that the physician's humanity must touch the unique personhood of the afflicted if the death is to be \"good\". A physician's duty does not rest on the medical profession's code of conduct; it consists of the physician's moral obligation to a specific person in a specific situation. That person's entire identity--not just the physical being--is assaulted by terminal illness; the emotional, familial, and social dimensions of selfhood are ravaged by the disease as surely as is the body. Each individual is involved in his or her suffering in a way that is unique and that cannot be understood or appreciated by anyone else. But the physician must try to bridge the distance that is placed around the sufferer by the dying process. And it is only with his or her own humanity that the care giver can accomplish this. That humanity should inform all decision making, and thus bring with it genuine control and comfort. In this way the patient can truly \"own\" his or her own death. The patient can thereby attain reason and courage, which together are the quality of grace.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Men may be divided into any number of classes-rich and poor, educated and ignorant, successful and unsuccessful, and so on; but none of these classifications is fundamental. A more vital classification or division of men would be those who live only in the present and those who live both in the present and the future. Having or lacking the power to project oneself into the future is what primarily divides men who move forward and upward from those who remain stationary or slip back. There is homely illustration often given to mark this dividing line. It is the difference between a man who plants a tree and a man to whom such an act would never appeal. The man who plants a tree performs an act in the spirit of the Great Creator. He serves not only himself but future generations unknown to him, who will enjoy its fruit and its shade. To realize in life the deeper meanings of success one’s vision cannot be limited by the circumscribed horizon of the present. It must transcend those bounds and take in the future. This comprehension of the future involves the spirit of altruism, the divine spirit of service to others, and embraces all men and all generations; but it carries not only these abstract and, perhaps to some, vague principles of altruism, but also a very concrete and individual value. For, contrary to the general notion, there is a future which is neither hazy nor unknown. There is a definitely known future, a future which it is possible to know as well as the past is known. This is the future in which those who are today going out from this institution are now probably most interested.",

      "abstract": "Theories that reject the existence of altruism presume that emotional benefits serve as ulterior motives for doing good deeds. These theories argue that even in the absence of material and reputational benefits, individuals reap utility from the feelings associated with doing good. In response to this normative view of altruism, this article examines the descriptive question of whether laypeople penalize emotional prosocial actors. Six studies find that emotion serves as a positive signal of moral character, despite the intrapsychic benefits associated with it. This is true when emotion motivates prosocial behavior (Studies 1, 2, 3, and 5) and when emotion is a positive outcome of prosocial behavior (i.e., \"warm glow\"; Studies 4, 5, and 6). Emotional actors are considered to be moral because people believe emotion provides an honest and direct signal that the actor feels a genuine concern for others. Consequently, prosocial actors who are motivated by the expectation of emotional rewards are judged differently than prosocial actors who are motivated by other benefits, such as reputational or material rewards (Study 6). These results suggest that laypeople do not view altruism as incompatible with all benefits to the self.",

      "title": "Whose Sati?: Widow Burning in Early 19th Century India",
      "abstract": "Whose Sati? Widow Burning in Early 19th Century India Anand A. Yang Intentionally interrogatory, the title of this essay emphasizes the speculative nature of my remarks regarding the phenomenon of sati. Derived from the Sanskrit term for pure or chaste (sef)—the very term \"sati,\" therefore, is a misnomer—sati has come to signify both the act of immolation of a wife on the funeral pyre of her husband (in some areas a widow was buried with her deceased husband or took poison) and the victim herself rather than its original meaning of \"a virtuous woman.\"1 Generally, a woman was burnt together with her deceased husband, a practice termed sahamarana or sahagamana (dying together with). But if concremation was not possible, such as when a husband died in a distant place or a woman's pregnancy required that she wait till after delivery, a sati conformed to the practice of anumarana or anugamana: burning with the husband's ashes or with some other memento representing him, for example, his sandals, turban, or piece of clothing. * The title also has another meaning, a double trajectory: an interrogation of the historical literature on the subject and an interrogation of sati as a practice involving women of different times, places, and backgrounds. Both lines of inquiry seek to converge on the same objective: better questions and answers regarding the phenomenon of sati. Hitherto, much of the literature on sati has tended to favor an institutional approach.3 Not surprisingly, the most familiar aspect of sati is the British campaign against it culminating in the promulgation of Regulation XVII in 1829 \"declaring the practice of suttee, or of burning or burying alive the widows of Hindus, illegal and punishable by the criminal courts.\"4 Viewed from this angle, the history of sati has been appropriated by some scholars to represent the beginnings of \"a deliberate policy of modernizing and westernizing Indian society,\" as embodied in the person and policies of Governor-General Lord Bentinck who directed the official campaign against sati, and in the emergence of a Bengal \"Renaissance\" under the guiding hand of the \"Father of Modern India,\" Raja Rammohun Roy, who acted as the Indian architect of this and other social reforms.s The legislative prohibition of sati has also \"become a founding moment in the history of women in modern India.\" To continue in the words of this scholar, colonial rule, with its moral civilizing claims, is said to have provided the contexts for a thoroughgoing re-evaluation of Indian \"tradition\" along lines more consonant with the \"modern\" economy and society ©1989 Journal of Women-s History, Vol. ι No. 2 (Fall)____________________ 1989 Anand A. Yang believed to have been the consequence of India's incorporation into the capitalist world system. In other words, even the most antiimperialist amongst us has felt forced to acknowledge the \"positive\" consequences of colonial rule for certain aspects of women's lives, if not in terms of actual practice, at least at the level of ideas about \"women's rights.\"6 But as Lata Mani's deconstruction of the colonial discourse on sati reveals, women were neither the subjects nor the objects of this discourse, \"but rather the grounds of the discourse on sati .... For the British, rescuing women becomes part of the civilizing mission. For the indigenous elite, protection of their status or its reform becomes an urgent necessity, in terms of the honor of the collective—religious or national.\"7 For the political and ideological context in which the government campaign for social reforms was waged, whether focusing on sati, infanticide , lhagi (ritual murder), or human sacrifice, aimed at entitling the British with the right to proclaim the superiority of their own values, and ultimately , to justify their right to rule. Only they could usher in the morality they found wanting in the indigenous civilization. Consider the tenor of the following government pronouncement on sati: Of the rite itself, of its horror and abomination not a word need be said. Every rational and civilized being must feel anxious for the termination of a practice so abhorrent from humanity. . . . But to the christian and to the Englishman, who by tolerating sanctions, and by...",

But the scholars differed on the meaning of the word rijs. So that this difference affects the accuracy of law and status whether everything that is haram is unclean or not. Also impact on the status of derivatives of illicit material such as alcohol, is najs or holy? So this study aims to parse different views on the reasons for these illegitimate material laws. The method used in this research is descriptive qualitative with an interdisciplinary approach. Based on data obtained from the results of literature studies from books, scientific journals, websites and others, it was found that the word rijs can be both material and non-material. Rijs tangible material means; dirty, najs and rotten. Rijs is in the form of non-material in the form of character and bad deeds that are not liked by God so that it can bring punishment and adzab. Materially the word rijs can be najs if it is related to animate beings. When it comes to non-animal materials such as alcohol, Rijs means haram which must be shunned, but not physically najs. So it can be said that \"Every najs must be haram, but not all haram must be najs\".",

The justification of the whole life is of concern primarily to one who feels it has come to an end, either because he considers the active period of his life to have ceased or because he is confronted with death.

      "title": "School Accountability beyond Test Scores - a Student-Centered Approach: Focus on Student-Not Subject Matter",
      "abstract": "Global Functioning Every individual begins life as a helpless, impotent, dependent parasite. Then with maturity an individual develops adequate powers to be a contributing member of society. So far as archeological researchers can determine, human beings have always lived in groups, and one can not conceive of an individual independent of the groups (culture) of which he/she is a member. First, of course, the group members in some fashion serves to foster the independence and maturity of the individual. Soon, however, in every individual, even in the earliest stages, there is clear evidence of an tenency toward a more complex and complete development (Rogers, 1979). Whether we are speaking of a flower or an oak tree, of an earthworm or a beautiful bird, of an ape or a man the is an active process: actualizing tendency can of course be thwarted, but it can not be destroyed without destroying the organism - It is clear that the actualizing tendency is selective and directional, a constructive tendency if you will. DSM-IV Model for Development Beginning about 1982 The American Psychiatric Association sought to find better ways and means to assess the development of individuals in our society. From 1982 to 1994 the focus was on developing accountability in relation to health care. The notions developed have important significance in the educational arena as well. These findings have been thoroughly validated by twelve field trials and 40 data re-analyses involving approximately one hundred subjects at each of seven different sites and involving mole than 6,000 subjects. Often the field trials allowed work groups to compare alternative options and to study the possible impact of suggested changes (DSM-IV, 1994). Concept and Development The University of Rochester in New York has done extensive research in relation to the wellness (Cowen, 1991). Here the focus is not on sickness, but rather on how well the individual is. A national association called The Wellness Institute was founded more than half dozen years ago at The University of Wisconsin at Stevens Point. Each year annual conventions are held and scientific data is presented concerning the concept of wellness, and where the wellbeing of individuals serve as attributes for assessing level of wellness. Here maturity of the individual is always an important and critical element; since the greater the level of maturity the greater the expectations of the individual involved. But far more important are concerns for self-esteem, self-efficacy, feelings of belonging, etc. (Bandara, 1993). Global Functioning as In terms of accountability the DSM-IV research developed a new concept of disability and where not only performance in the workplace, but also in school and learning, and in the social functioning of the individual were to be included. Federal laws today provide for an assessment of the functioning of persons receiving health care under public money when they first come for such treatment, and then again after a period of such treatment when payment is expected. If the functioning is not improved, before payment is made the case is referred to a committee of peers (health care professionals) to determine if the treatment used techniques or processes that have been demonstrated through research to be effective. Where treatment process is found to be flawed, payment for such service is denied. This is considered to represents accountability in health care. It is clear that the functioning concept is equally applicable in the home, in the school, and wherever human development and growth is involved. Always, global means broader that the workplace, which includes the school learning and the home. The Global Functioning Test The San Francisco longitudinal study was designed primarily to determine the underlying syndrome of deviant behavior (Shedler and Block, 1990). …",

      "abstract": "Manners seem to have disappeared from scientific discourse, much as some would say they have disappeared from everyday life. Yet, though we may discuss them little, all of us adhere to invisible rules of behaviour that smooth our social interactions. We sit at a polite distance, we wear clean clothes to church, we close the toilet door behind us, we offer laundered sheets and towels to guests, and above all we are continent with our bodily emanations. In this chapter I present a framework for understanding manners. I begin with the evolution of disgust, which serves to prevent the risk of infection to the self. From this evolved the hygienic behaviours that protect others from one's own risky emanations. From this came the rules of behaviour about not inflicting infection on others that we know as manners, without which the disease costs of social interaction would outweigh the benefits. Those individuals who failed to display good manners would find themselves the object of disgust and be punished by shunning and social exclusion. Since disgust of bad behaviour, and punishment by shunning and exclusion is also key to the human ability to maintain cooperation between unrelated individuals, it follows that manners were probably prototypical of our system of morality. Hence manners are a key step on the road to towards the astonishingly complex world that humans have built through our ability to cooperate. As such, manners deserve much more serious study.",

      "title": "On Practices. (Dialogue on Tradition)",
      "abstract": "I am grateful to Dr. Frohnen for providing me with an opportunity to elucidate further my analysis of tradition (1) and its place in social life. My response will take a step toward him but then two back. Frohnen suggests (2) that my analysis of tradition is too abstract in that it ignores the way traditions are embedded in habits and social interactions. However, I suspect the difference between us here is largely terminological. My concept of tradition refers to ideas or beliefs--though not necessarily conscious and rational ones--that we inherit and that then form the background to our later development. However, while I thus equate traditions exclusively with ideas or beliefs, I am happy to allow that beliefs and traditions are always embedded in actions and practices, perhaps the habits and social interactions invoked by Frohnen. Neither beliefs nor traditions exist as disembodied entities apart from their instantiation in our lives and activities. Indeed, we can come to ascribe beliefs to people, including ourselves, only through an interpretation of actions. Frohnen and I thus differ here only in our use of words: when he writes about traditions, he refers to what I would call practices, for I prefer to reserve the term tradition to refer to the beliefs or meanings that inform such practices. Even after I shift my attention from traditions conceived as beliefs to practices conceived as the clusters of actions and interactions that embody such beliefs, however, two significant differences remain in the ways Frohnen and I would characterize such practices. One difference arises over what it means to say traditions are concrete, social realities. Although I am willing to allow that tradition is embedded in practice, which is, of course, part of concrete social reality, I do not think particular practices are natural kinds, or discrete chunks, with clear boundaries by which we might individuate them. There are no natural or given limits to particular practices by which we might separate them out from the general flux of human life. For example, the boundary of a Church does not clearly appear with those who attend weekly services, those who attend services once or twice a year, those who wander in for private prayer, those who go to secular events organized by the Church, or those who are helped direc tly by the social work of the Church. Where we locate the limits of practices must be a pragmatic decision that we can justify only by reference to the purposes of our so doing. Practices are concrete social realities, but they are not natural kinds. Thus, we have to allow, as I do but Frohnen does not, that in a sense we construct or individuate particular practices to suit our purposes. We should not pretend that certain practices have a natural place in social life. …",

      "abstract": "If we make anything, it seems that we cannot avoid making it in our own image and likeness; to this fact I attribute the note of autobiography which creeps into any ‘life’ written by one man of another. We cannot see in another qualities of which we are ourselves deficient; a man that is colour-blind cannot introduce accurate tones into his picture, be his line ever so perfect. It follows that we cannot expect a good life of St. Dominic except from a Saint. Nevertheless, as no one is without some elements of sanctity, each one, according to his measure, will be able to appreciate St. Dominic, in whom these are pressed down and running over. We must not discount his virtues because they appear as perfections of our own, for it is through these virtues that we shall reach him. The philosopher will see St. Dominic as a philosopher, the contemplative as a contemplative, the organiser as a Master General; indeed, each man sees his hero as himself, generously bereft of the frailties and indecisions flesh is heir to. This limitation of our vision is, in a way, a reflection of the mystery of the Incarnation, and, as such, a source of comfort. Man can make or reproduce only what he has seen, but the vision takes form in his own image; the maker is revealed in the thing made. It is not only ‘Dawn’ which, Eblis-like, sits upon the portals of the Underground, but Epstein; it is not Spring arising from the shell, but Botticelli; it is not only the mystery of Father Brown, but the life of Mr. Chesterton in which we are intrigued.",

Initialement, l’homme a ete prive de parametres corporels permettant de survivre, alors que par la suite ont surgi les capacites et les pouvoirs d’inventer en abondance tout ce qui lui manquait a sa plenitude－soit des dents aigues et des ongles, soit bonheur, spiritualite, argent, puissance, potentiel plus performant cognitif, jeunesse ou beaute.

L’article est consacre aux variantes historiquement differentes avant-theoriques et theoriques de la pensee de l’ ≪etre incomplet≫ ainsi qu’a la demonstration des consequences auxquelles le jeu d’incompletude l’a amene.

      "abstract": "Non-human animals are as a matter of routine used as means to human ends. They are killed for food, employed for labour or sport, and experimented on in the pursuit of human health, knowledge, comfort and beauty. Lip-service is paid to the obligation to cause no unnecessary suffering, but human necessity is interpreted so generously that this is a negligible constraint. The dominant traditions of Western thought, religious and secular, have provided legitimation of the low or non-existent moral status of beasts. The rival tradition, which includes the Neo-Platonists, Plutarch and Montaigne, is eccentric and archaic. But the teleologies and hierarchies of orthodoxy are equally incredible now and owe their greater respectability and influence to the inertia of custom. Disregard for beasts is supported partly by the vestigial and unowned belief that they are intended for our use, partly by a more recent piece of lore which is not only thought to be compatible with, but is sometimes held to be integral to, an enlightened scientific outlook, namely that beasts are mere complex stimulus—response mechanisms. The latter is a vexatious obstacle to progress but despite that the state of scientific and philosophical knowledge is now enormously more propitious for a re-appraisal of the moral status of beasts. Two moral philosophers, Peter Singer and Stephen Clark, have recently published books in which such a re-appraisal is attempted. Here I try to compare and assess some of the main features of their very different approaches.",

The primary container and first leader. The one who provides a non-verbal and emotional presence. She grasps his being, his unique being, and his distress. The first function as container is to translate unthinkable thoughts into those available for thinking. The message is transformed inside her, the container. The maternal object, functioning as a thinking agent. A non-verbal emotional presence. Thus a link is formed. Without this the infant, unable to tolerate his distress, can only eject it as soon as possible. Any preconception that there would be a containing and nourishing object, available for intimate relationships, is destroyed, leaving only anxiety, confusion and hatred, and it is this which is projected. The important question is, can leaders in more sophisticated settings stand and understand this aspect of their role? Can they contain the anxiety which accompanies it? I propose to link the function of the \"good enough\" mother, able to be omnipresent in a state of \"reverie\", to deal with the protomental confusion of the infant, to Bion's theory of thinking with its emphasis on role and function.",

The phenomenological study of action as a phenomenon emerges here as a necessary stage of such a science of actions. The term \"science of actions\" must be carefully delimited because it covers the totality of life itself, in any case in a \"to do-society\" where the human being who does not act does not exist. The theory of orders or decisions is more easily built starting from general messages and the properties of their elements than from the idea of power delegation or moral constraint. Ecology of acts will study the statistical interactions that may happen between distinct \"species of acts\" that can be differentiated within a certain domain in time or space.",

      "title": "Self-Interest, Altruism, and Virtue",
      "abstract": "My topic in this essay is the comparative moral value of self-interest and altruism. I take self-interest to consist in a positive attitude toward one's own good and altruism to consist in a similar attitude toward the good of others, and I assess these attitudes within a general theory of the intrinsic value of attitudes toward goods and evils. The first two sections of the essay apply this theory in a simple form, one that treats self-interest and altruism symmetrically. The third section examines whether the theory can be revised to accommodate an apparent asymmetry in our common-sense thinking about self-interested and altruistic attitudes. I will start by assuming that each person has a good, or that certain states of the person are intrinsically desirable and others undesirable. Of course, philosophers have disagreed for centuries about what this good consists in, or what particular states are desirable. Welfarists take each person's good to consist in pleasure, the fulfillment of her preferences, or something describable as “welfare” or “happiness.” Perfectionists hold that certain states of a person are good apart from any connection with happiness. Thus, some perfectionists hold that knowledge, achievement, and deep personal relations are good independently of how much a person wants or enjoys them. For the purposes of this essay it does not matter much which initial claims about the good we accept. To discuss issues about self-interest and altruism we need only some initial theory of each person's good, whatever its specific content. Consequently, and to cover as many bases as possible, I will start by assuming a mixed welfarist-perfectionist theory of the good, one claiming that pleasure, knowledge, and achievement are all intrinsically good.",

A broad theory, of a multiequal institutional world in which no single institution dominates, is presented. Each individual can find one or more central life interests within a single institution in which to invest the bulk of affective energies. All other behaviors are enacted as required behaviors with a minimum of affect invested in them. Through this duality of response the contradictory demands on behavior among several institutions can be mediated. The sociopsychological mechanisms underlying these dual responses are set forth. It is concluded that the social world of the person, however complex, can be ordered through the operation of central life interests, to maintain self-integrity even while behaving in contradictory ways.",

Appeal, in turn, depends on tastes, which in contrast to goals and standards, tend to be unanalyzable, Hence, the Attraction emotions are the least cognitively complex of all emotions. Tastes are treated broadly and include attitudes and preferences, and the notion of an object is also broad, including anything that is evaluated qua object, meaning that even events or agents’ actions can be viewed as objects. Although issues pertaining to aesthetic judgment are raised, they are not the focus of Attraction emotions. The Attraction emotion identified depends on whether an object is evaluated as being appealing or unappealing and whether it is viewed as itself being capable of emotion. Crossing these dimensions leads to four emotion types: “Affection” and “Enmity” emotions, which pertain to emotion-capable (generally animate) objects, and “Appreciation” and “Distaste” emotions, which pertain to emotion-incapable (generally inanimate) objects.",

El resultado final de la sobreexposición a glucocorticoides se refleja en la alteración de los sistemas corporales con hiperglucemia, hipertensión, infecciones recurrentes, alteración de la memoria y del control del comportamiento. Reconocer los eventos que pueden estresar a los animales domésticos no es sencillo. Mientras que algunos desencadenantes de estrés son fácilmente reconocidos por el hombre (temperaturas extremas, falta de alimentos, lesiones severas) otros pueden pasar desapercibidos (territorio, relaciones sociales, motivaciones, olores y sonidos). Por otra parte, se reconoce que la habituación a la especie humana en edad temprana es indispensable para una buena relación humano-animal, más aún, el ambiente humano puede ser percibido como un factor estresante en sí mismo.",

      "abstract": "Exhibit A is a black-and-white photograph. Burned at the edges, it is difficult to date, and its space is ambiguous-a spare studio, perhaps a hotel dive. A pensive man stands to the right, cut by the frame (we see only a profile of a head, a hand with a cigarette, a bit of a shoe); a wicker chair is turned to the corner; and a male leg extends from the left wall. Trousered, shod, and cut below the knee, it is inexplicable. The man peers at the leg. Does he investigate a crime or revisit a deed of his own, ponder a work of art or hallucinate a body part? Is he the witness of the event? Its perpetrator? Its victim? Or is he somehow all three? Clearly the man is a voyeur; but, if the leg is somehow his, is he not an exhibitionist as well? To gaze so seems a little sadistic; yet, if this humiliated leg is somehow his, is he not a little masochistic too? This ambivalence of active and passive roles is performed in visual terms: both an active seeing and a passive being-seen are in play here, and they meet in a reflexive seeing oneself.1 The man is Robert Gober in 1991, and this is the uncanny thing about his art: before it or (more exactly) within it, one has the strange sense of seeing oneself, of revisiting the crime that is oneself. Exhibit B is drawn from an interview in 1990/93. Asked about his way of working, Gober replies: It's more a nursing of an image that haunts me and letting it sit and breed in my mind, and then, if it's resonant, I'll try to figure out formally, could this be an interesting sculpture to look at?

Predatory or exploitative attitudes to others are incompatible with the respect that is properly owed to their humanity. It is true, of course, that none of us could prosper or even survive without a lot of assistance from other people. But Kant's principle is not the impossible injunction to be entirely self-sufficient.

Consequently, prayer for God so to act is misjudged and inappropriate. This article argues that this conclusion runs counter to the biblical record, which sees God’s relationship with the world as sustaining and upholding, but also allowing for specific willed actions. However, God has given the world functional autonomy, which would be abrogated by interventions too predictable or too attributable. It is proposed that intervention by God is real and not uncommon, but often of concealed and unprovable provenance. God’s self-limitation with regard to intervention is seen as consistent but chosen, in contrast to Oord’s proposal of an ‘essential’ kenosis.",

All animals rely on direct, causal interaction with their environment to endorse the perceptual predication of properties to objects; all shift attention sub-intentionally, often in pursuit of other intentional goals; and all dismiss or neglect perceptions that prove behaviorally misleading. But equipped with percipience, the humanoids can increase the range of properties perceived, can regulate their attention intentionally in seeking the answers to various questions, and can judge and believe that things are not as they are perceived to be rather than investing perception with unquestioned authority: they can distinguish appearance from reality, finding their way to aesthetic appreciation and speculative thought. Percipience can also enhance the awareness of what they perceive, which they share with the non-percipient, transforming their consciousness-in-perception. And it can enable them, unlike other perceivers, to enjoy consciousness-of-perception: to be able to recognize as such the perceptual states in which their world is presented, and possibly mis-presented, to them.",

      "abstract": "In many ancient Hindu, Jain, and Buddhist texts, the path of the ascetic lifestyle involves an injunction to practice nonviolence, a requirement that conflicts with the violence that the ascetic inflicts upon him/herself by going naked, clothed in coarse garments made of discarded cloth, tree bark, or grass, excessive limits on food in-take, self-mutilation, sleep deprivation, and practicing various forms of extreme austerities in an effort to gain control over one's body, breathing rhythms, and mind. In spite of taking a vow of nonviolence, many Indian ascetics inflict painful harm upon their own bodies that represents a process of marking their bodies, which enables them to create their own bodies in particular ways that distinguish them from ordinary members of society by means of practicing their regimen of discipline. These bodily marks or characteristics make it easy for people within society to recognize their religious status outside of normal social intercourse and on the margins of Indian culture. A popular method of marking an ascetic's body is through extreme forms of fasting, a type of practice pushed to its most excessive extent by the vow to fast unto death by a Jain ascetic. Using fasting as an example of self-inflicted violence by the Indian ascetic, helps us to witness that violence and nonviolence are relative concepts because their degrees of social acceptability differ among religious cultures and even within particular religions. The relative nature of violence and nonviolence can also be traced to its acceptability during changing historical periods and circumstances. Even though violence and nonviolence are relative notions, violence signifies actions that injure, causes harm or pain, or destroys an object, animal, or person, whereas nonviolence is relative to other persons, animals, or things.",

      "abstract": "The purpose of this thesis is a complex phenomenon, the oath, which always arouses the interest of lawyers, historians, anthropologists, ethnologists, theologians, linguists, philosophers, with regard to its early development in the most remote Roman antiquity. The phenomenological and conceptual complexity of the oath, located at the intersection of different disciplines and territories, is such that none of these can fully claim it, nor can it define it in its full complexity and global relevance. \r\nOf particular value is Paolo Prodi’s attempt to identify an “a-ahistorical and still” core of the oath-event, which consists of an invocation to the deity as a witness and guarantee of truth / veracity of a statement or declaration-of' commitment-promise to perform or have performed a certain action or to maintain a certain behavior in the future by an individual, who aspires to play in his bodily and spiritual life based on common beliefs that draw from the meta-political sphere. It is, also, significant consider to the oath as a responsibility assumption accomplished by the individual not in front of his partner, who is directly interested in what he asserts or promises, but in front of a third party unconnected with such dealings, that is the deity.\r\nIf we look at the oldest time, the oath is found at the basis of various relations, from international treaties to sacramentum militiae, from iusiurandum between private parties to legis actio sacramento. Some of them are ab antiquo attracted to the fides and originally find their source in an oath or a foundation to it closely relatable. It is then perceived relations in a religious dimension, in which the juridical aspect is bound to the sacred value of connected to the oath. In the Archaic period the institution seems to create some sort of unity between the everyday life of the subject, as well as the community, and the religious sphere above them, reconnecting the vicissitudes of social life to the religious beliefs of the community.\r\nIn order to fully understand the origins of this institution, we will begin with the etymologist analysis and the study of archetypes “Per Dius Fidius”, “Iovem lapidem” and “Ita me Hercules iuvet”, and then move on to consider the elements constituents: the certa verba and gesture, the invocation to the deity and the curse of perjury.\r\nSet the general characteristics of the oath and its function, sensitive to the unique needs of the archaic Roman reality, we will conclude by outlining the implications in the context of sponsio, foedus and ancient legis actio sacramento, with particular attention to the evolution of this institution.",

Furthermore, the visible and tangible aspects of life are intrinsically connected to and dependent on the invisible and intangible aspects - much as the visible branches and fruit of a tree are connected to and dependent on an underlying and hidden root structure. While the importance of intangibles can be understood intuitively, it can also be illustrated: 73% of all chartable giving in the U.S. goes to organizations that are explicitly religious, and 118,280 nonprofit organizations are so strongly identified with the intangibles of hope, trust, faith, love, joy, peace that they included one of these words in their name. While the intangible realities of human life are explicitly relevant to a large proportion of organizations we seek to serve, it is essentially ignored by current evaluation practice: only 10 articles within the American Journal of Evaluation, New Directions in Evaluation and Journal of Multidisciplinary Evaluation included even minimal reference to the most common intangibles. New evaluation theory and methodology to address this gap will be needed, and cross-disciplinary exploration with psychology, philosophy and sociology should guide this development. In the meantime, useful questions about intangibles can be drawn from the AEA guiding principles and addressing these can provide a useful starting point for evaluators seeking to consider intangibles within their evaluations.",

      "title": "Paradoxes in the Invisibility of Care Work",
      "abstract": "My paper focuses on the theme of visibility by teasing out some paradoxes of invisibility. In the ordinary social world, what is said to be invisible is generally what is here, right before our eyes, but to which we pay no attention. Care is invisible because it goes on without us seeing it. By suddenly making visible what is ordinarily invisible, the COVID pandemic has been a strange pedagogical moment, making visible the people who take care of “us”, and revealing our entire society’s ignorance of what allows it to live—whether in the context of everyday life or in the urgency of the risk of death. The grammar of care has thus imposed itself on everyone, because care is never so visible as in those situations where a form of life is shaken. Care work has been revealed as invisible work that keeps everyone going. “Invisible” does not refer to a difficulty in perceiving but rather a refusal to see. A refusal to see something that is not hidden, but which we do not see precisely because it is right before our eyes. Invisibility is thus denial, in both the social and the theoretical realms, especially when care work is envisioned in the terms of the further invisibilization of care work when it is done for the benefit of women as in the “care drain” from poor to rich countries. The asymmetry in the relations between North and South is part of the invisibility of what sustains societies. The invisible chains of care reveal the extent to which the question of service is the fundamental question of social invisibility.",

The theoretical point concerning these acting positions is that each demand a stable set of acts, and work from different logics. This stability is unmoved by such things as changes in the identity or in the preferences of the actor. The actor must subordinate himself under the logic of the position if he is to be able to co-operate with other actors. The Stellvertreter acts in another’s name, alieno nomine agere, while the Vertreter answers for another’s acts. In many situations, an actor may act as the one or the other - the priest acts in the name of God and answers for the acts of the church, which is problematic since the two may be opposed, even antagonistic, to each other.",

Will he still be Paul, Peter or John as we knew him before? These are the questions asked by friends and relatives of the person undergoing an analysis. Whether it is the doctor, the friend, the husband or wife, the parents, the spiritual director or religious superior, everyone has the feeling that from now on the person being analysed will escape them in some way and that he will enter the domain of a secret and mysterious power of which they have not the key … and that with a bit of luck he could become a balanced individual! This desire to know ‘what it’s all about’ is all the more ardent because psychoanalysis does not fall into the usual categories of medicine. With medicine, the moralist and the believer consider that they can keep within their own domain: the doctor is concerned with curing the body and eliminating suffering; the Christian is concerned with judging moral conduct and speaking on the meaning of suffering. But with psychoanalysis, these yardsticks are of no use, so the argument goes, because the whole personality of the individual is radically questioned. This uncertainty is inevitable. Indeed, psychoanalysis will be dead on the day that it is put to the service of some institution whether it be educational, economic, political or religious. It is concerned with something else: a truth which goes beyond the analyst and the analysed.",

It is the process by which all the pieces of the living world find their relationships to the other pieces to form larger wholes and to enable the living world to grow, adapt, and survive. In this article I explore the matter of sharing communication in groups, which I refer to as cooperation. Cooperation is different from the process involved when two individuals exchange messages, an interaction I refer to as negotiation. When two or more people come together and interact, a third entity emerges: a relationship. One must necessarily communicate with (relate to) both another person and with the relationship. A married person relates not only to a spouse but to the higher-order entity, the relationship. In school a student relates not only to individuals but to the class as an entity with its own characteristics and demands. While we are fairly explicit about the rules (politeness, use of language) for interpersonal communication, we tend to behave as though groups are only collections of individuals and that cooperation is achieved through negotiation. We do not recognize that the higher-order group-shared communication which I call cooperation requires a different set of rules and has a different purpose or function. Rather, we invoke the processes appropriate for interpersonal communication and thus rarely become a truly cooperating, sharing group,",

      "abstract": "Human functioning is the overriding, all encompassing activity that includes the entire range from the cellular to the spiritual. It is never entirely still or absent except in death. To think of sickness in terms of functioning implies consideration of living beings with minds, emotions, thoughts, intentions, choice, and agency—the ability to act—in other words, persons. We cannot really know about functioning humans without knowing the state of the body and bodily functions and what the person is doing and for what reasons or intentions. The basic aim of healers must be the enabling or return of function so that patients may pursue or achieve their purposes and goals. This requires an understanding of sickness that is different from the contemporary concepts of disease. Impairment, impediment, handicap, and disability are defined. The use of the International Classification of Function and its terms are discussed, as well as the importance of understanding process. Illustrative cases are presented.",

      "abstract": "acan's well-known aphoristic formulations that is desire of and the uncon- scious is discourse of necessarily entail that human subject is a social subject. Coming to life inevitably among language users, subject is constructed in an identification with signifiers of language—with letters, sounds, detached words and phrases—which become elements of uncon- scious, organized in a syntax of metaphor and metonymy. The child addresses demands to mother or caretaker in signifiers and is addressed through signifiers which henceforth mark and deter- mine desire. Entering into social exchange through language, desire pursues an object beyond whatever would fulfill subject's immediate needs, its satisfac- tion never adequate to love it wants. The uncon- scious is discourse of Other, because signifiers motivate and carry subject's desire, forming asso- ciative networks and chains that remain material of an unknown, that is, repressed, memory. Language takes form by excluding Thing, lacking substance of complete enjoyment, or jouis- sance, whose absence is occupied by mother as Other and covered over by object of drive, objet a, that is detached from body. The subject identi- fies with lacking object and thereby tries to attain an impossible jouissance. Desire is desire of Other, because subject wants to be what lack- ing Other desires; its desire is an answer to ques- tion of Other's desire. It is as a prohibition of that Other, mother whose desire subject questions and wants to answer to, that Name of Father is introduced, propelling subject into language by forbidding ultimate jouissance of incest. In process of castration, subject gives up project of filling Other's lack and takes on a sexual position as masculine or feminine, its jouissance reduced to lim- ited pleasures. In nuclear family of modern, West- ern cultures, castration operates through Oedipus complex, and it will take different forms in different kinship systems, but castration or incest prohibi- tion must function in subject formation as Law that is prerequisite for any social being ruled by particular social laws. The Freudian myth of primal father makes leg- ible necessity of incest prohibition at origin of social organization, as does Lacan's assertion that ten commandments derive from incest prohibition and that moral law is law of language. Moustapha Safouan likewise argues that law of lan- guage—in other words, incest prohibition—is basis for social relation. The regulation of reciprocity in marriage, made possible by incest prohibition, is law of exchange that governs speech. But law that allows for social being cannot in itself determine what would be a more or less just society, nor can it predict what specific forms reciprocity will take in any given society, just that there be reciprocal exchange. So language of any given culture, even while it derives from universal prohibition, will carry weight of its accumulated experience, customs, and forms of domination, marking its specificity in master signifiers that will consequently mark desire and hence unconscious material of culture's subjects. In an increasingly global economy, master sig- nifiers of dominating international regime increas- ingly infiltrate local cultures and economies, introduc- ing new ideals for identification and new forms of coercion and reinforcing established forms of injustice. The global master discourse, because it has power to determine forms of social exchange universally, en- ters into unconscious processes of subjects everywhere to construct desire.

If this principle, ever since known as Occam's razor, be used to shave off redundant postulates about human behavior, only three fundamental propositions remain, to wit: First, all men, at all times, have endeavored to retain their health, prolong their lives, and expand their knowledge of and control over their physical environment. Second, they have sought to establish and enhance their interpersonal relationships so as to achieve greater familial, economic, social, and cultural securities. Third, they have cherished various systems of beliefs an eternal search for philosophic or religious serenity. Anyone reasonably successful all these spheres is regarded by his social order as being in good physical and mental health; indeed, the very term health, as derived from the Anglo-Saxon root hai or hoi, has the triple connotation of hale (physical well-being), hail!

Conversely, anyone who fails his material, cultural, or philosophic adaptations experiences deep anxiety or ndis-ease.M Technically, the latter term should apply only to the first category of failures, which organic defects, infections, injuries, or deteriorations actually impair oneTs physical capacities.

      "abstract": "(ProQuest: ... denotes formulae omitted.) He does not make gods who sculpts sacred faces into gold or marble; he makes gods who asks of them. The humblest could hiss you at games or piss on your statue. They could kill you. Honour is always a question of ascription, not a matter of fact or individual right.1 That and shame were and (for most part) remain pivotal cultural values in Mediterranean is really beyond question. One can debate fruitfully how and shame work together and independently, and how they work differently in different locations, but there is more than enough evidence to defend proposition that in Mediterranean, past and present, these values remain pivotal.2 The broadly accepted anthropological definition of and shame has been distilled from two sources: observation of human interaction in person3 and ancient literary and epigraphical remains.4 From vast amount of modern ethnographic work and ancient primary sources, Bruce Malina developed a model of and shame that, while criticized,5 has stood test of time. Many scholars of biblical antiquity have benefited from explanatory power of Malina's model, an influence not limited to those affiliated with Context Group.6 This much is admitted in otherwise critical article by F. Gerald Downing.7 Yet, despite obvious strengths of Malina's model, it is starting to show signs of its age and might benefit from some changes that would increase its heuristic power and longevity. It is always good to return periodically to look with fresh eyes at our models and data we use to construct them, and I think we shall be rewarded by doing so here. I. REVIEWING MALINA'S HONOR AND SHAME Malina claimed that concerns of and shame are to be found where authority, gender status, and respect intersect. Authority is ability to control others without force; gender status refers to different standards of acceptable behavior that apply to males and females; respect refers to attitude one ought to have toward those who control your existence (humans, gods, God). Where these three intersect, Malina situates his well-known definition of honor: the value of a person in his or her own eyes (that is, one's claim to worth) plus that person's value in eyes of his or her social group.8 Honor, for Malina (as for Julian Pitt-Rivers and John G. Peristiany before him), relies on claims to from a person and assessment of that claim by a public court of reputation (hereafter PCR). There are two types of honor; Malina calls them ascribed honor and honor. Ascribed is with which one is born: by ethnicity, family reputation, gender, wealth, and so on. This tends to be less dynamic than acquired honor, which can be won and lost on a daily basis through acts of benefaction and agonistic contest of challenge and riposte. Honor cultures are not a unique feature of Mediterranean area. Honor cultures appear also in Japan and South America and within subcultures in nonhonor cultures (e.g., North American sports teams, military and police forces, and gangs). An culture is defined by seriousness with which people who inhabit it protect their and fight to retrieve it if it has been lost. This phenomenon can exist only in concert with perception that access to is limited. If there were enough to go around, losing a little here and there would carry no consequences. This is an important distinction to draw, for it is also what distinguishes and shame cultures from non-honor and shame cultures: a non-honor and shame culture might well know and shame, but it does not see as a limited good and thus does not contest it with same intensity. It is Malina's understanding of challenge and riposte contest that will be focus of my critique of his model. …",

That may sound trivial, but I like to point out that the same is not true e.g. for orthopedic dentistry, an area of applied human knowledge that is hardly more complex than keeping animals with proper attention to all details.

      "title": "Being-on-the-Bench: An Existential Analysis of the Substitute in Sport",
      "abstract": "Abstract Being a substitute in sport appears to contradict the rationale behind being involved in that sport, especially in those sports where substitutes frequently remain unused or are brought on to the field of play for the final moments of that game. For the coach or manager, substitutes function as a way to improve the team achieving a particular end, namely to win the game; whether to replace an injured or tired player, to change a team's structure or tactics, to complete a specialised manoeuvre (such as goal kicking in American football or a short corner in hockey), or to run down the clock. Whether a substitute is afforded an opportunity of playing the game appears to be directed by others; arguably if one had a choice in the matter one would chose to be on the field of play rather than off it. Nevertheless, the Existentialist position is that our situation is always inexorably one that is freely chosen. To argue that one has not freely chosen one's position is to be 'inauthentic'. Furthermore, to conceptualise one's manifestation and to be treated by others as a thing 'in-itself'–such as a substitute – is to fall into 'bad faith'. Culbertson (2005 Culbertson, L. 2005. The paradox of bad faith and elite competitive sport. Journal of Philosophy of Sport, 32: 65–86. [Taylor & Francis Online], [Web of Science ®] , [Google Scholar]) has already argued that elite competitive sport is an arena that promotes rather than avoids bad faith due to its constituent factors. Culbertson's frame of reference primarily applied to sporting events that involve individuals competing in co-active, parallel competition – such as athletics, swimming or weightlifting – where bad faith is generated via a tacit acceptance of ever-improving and quantifiable performance. The purpose of this paper is a continuation of such an enquiry but with a redirection of focus away from parallel competition by individuals towards team competitions which are, by nature, less concerned with an unremitting contest against time, distance or some other measurable concept. This paper sets out to examine the nature of the substitute in sport, who appears to be equally liable to find herself being 'inauthentic' and/or in 'bad faith'. It attempts to consider the nature of these concepts and offer direction as to how substitutes can attempt to realise the Existential ideal. Resumen Ser un suplente en el deporte parece contradecir el fundamento mismo de estar involucrado con tal deporte, especialmente en aquellos deportes donde los suplentes se quedan en el banquillo a menudo o son sacados al campo de juego durante los momentos finales del partido. Para el entrenador o mánager, los suplentes funcionan como un medio para mejorar el rendimiento del equipo a la hora de conseguir un objetivo determinado, esto es ganar el partido; bien sea sustituyendo a un jugador lesionado o cansado, para cambiar la estructura o la táctica, para completar una maniobra especializada (por ejemplo marcar un gol punteando en fútbol americano o un saque de esquina corto en hockey), o para dejar pasar el tiempo en los momentos finales. Parece ser que si se le da a un suplente la oportunidad de jugar en un partido, esto depende de otros. Podría decirse que si uno tuviera elección en el asunto, preferiría estar en el campo de juego en vez de afuera. Sin embargo, la posición existencialista es que nuestra situación siempre es inexorablemente una que ha sido elegida libremente. Sostener que uno no ha escogido libremente su situación es ser \"inauténtico\". Además, el conceptualizar la manifestación de uno mismo y el ser tratado por los demás como una \"cosa-en-sí-misma\"—tal como es un suplente—es el pecar de \"mala fe\". Culbertson (1) ya ha sostenido que el deporte competitivo de élite es una área que promueve más que evita la mala fe debido a sus elementos constituyentes propios. El esquema de referencia de Culbertson se refería mayormente a eventos deportivos que involucran individuos que compiten en competiciones paralelas y coactivas, tales como el atletismo, la natación, o la halterofilia, donde la mala fe se genera por medio de una aprobación tácita del siempre mejorable y cuantificable rendimiento deportivo. El propósito de este artículo es continuar tal cuestión, mas dirigiendo el enfoque en vez de hacia la competición paralela de individuos, hacia la competición por equipos, al estar éstos, por naturaleza, menos preocupados por la incesante competición contra el reloj, la distancia, o algún otro concepto medible. Este artículo quiere examinar la naturaleza de la suplente en el deporte, quien parece ser puede encontrarse tan fácilemente siendo \"inauténtica\" como culpable de \"mala fe\". Intenta considerar la naturaleza de estos conceptos y ofrecer una dirección de cómo los suplentes pueden intentar realizar el ideal existencial. Zusammenfassung Ein Auswechselspieler zu sein scheint der Idee des Sports zu widersprechen, insbesondere in Sportarten, in denen Auswechselspieler gar nicht oder erst zum Ende hin ins Spiel kommen. Aus Sicht des Trainers oder des Managers erfüllen Auswechselspieler den Zweck, die Mannschaft zu verbessern, um bestimmte Ziele zu erreichen, das heißt, ein Spiel zu gewinnen; sei es einen verletzten oder müden Spieler zu ersetzen, sei es um die Aufstellung zu verändern oder aus taktischen Gründen, um einen speziellen Spielzug auszuführen (wie beispielsweise der Torschuss im American Football oder die kurze Ecke im Hockey), oder um auf Zeit zu spielen. Ob dem Auswechselspieler die Gelegenheit gegeben wird zu spielen, scheint von anderen entschieden zu werden; hätte ein Spieler die Wahl, würde er sich wohl dafür entscheiden zu spielen, anstatt auf der Bank zu sitzen. Wie dem auch sei, aus existenzialistischer Sicht beruht unsere Situation immer auf einer freien und unumgänglichen Entscheidung. Zu behaupten, jemand habe seine eigene Situation nicht frei gewählt, ist gleichbedeutend mit der Aussage, jemand sei ,nicht authentisch'. Des Weiteren ist es ein Rückfall in die Unwahrhaftigkeit, den eigenen Willen sprachlich zu fassen, sich jedoch von anderen als Ding ,an sich' – als Auswechselspieler – behandeln zu lassen. Culbertson (1) hat bereits argumentiert, dass Wettkampfsport auf Hochleistungsniveau aufgrund seiner ihn konstituierenden Faktoren ein Feld ist, das derartige Unwahrhaftigkeiten eher befördert denn vermeidet. Culbertsons primärer Bezugspunkt sind Sportereignisse mit Individuen in co-agierenden, parallelen Wettkämpfen – wie zum Beispiel Leichtathletik, Schwimmen oder Gewichtheben – wo die Unwahrhaftigkeit durch die stillschweigende Akzeptanz des konstanten Verbesserungsimperativs und der Quantifizierbarkeit der Leistungen entsteht. Ziel dieses Aufsatzes ist eine Fortführung der Fragerichtung, allerdings mit einer Neuausrichtung des Fokus weg von Parallel-Wettkämpfen von Individuen hin zu Mannschafts-Wettkämpfen. Letztere sind von Natur aus weniger interessiert an einem unablässigen Wettlauf gegen die Zeit, Distanzen oder anderen messbaren Konzepten. Dieser Artikel beabsichtigt, die Natur des Auswechselspielers im Sport zu beleuchten, der scheinbar gleichermaßen für sein uneigentliches und/oder unwahrhaftiges Sein verantwortlich gemacht wird. Dieser Text versucht, den Kern dieser Konzepte zu erschließen und zeigt gleichzeitig einen Weg auf, wie Auswechselspieler das existenzialistische Ideal verwirklichen können. Keywords: existentialismauthenticitybad faithsubstitutesport Acknowledgements The author would like to thank the two anonymous referees for their helpful suggestions and comments on an earlier draft of this paper. Notes 1. Heidegger (1977) uses the term 'Bestand' to describe the human tendency to view the world as something to be divided into representations of objects to be used and consumed for human purpose. It is this 'technological attitude' that conceals from humans their own being and prevents them from being authentic. 2. The term 'team' sport corresponds to sports that involve more than two players. Doubles events in racquet sports, for example, do not allow for the substitution of an individual in a pair either before or during a competition. 3. Indeed, there were complaints by the Australians during the 2005 Ashes Test that England's use of their substitute ran against the 'spirit' of the game. See Martin Gough, 'Substitute row mars Ashes series', BBC Sport website, 28 Aug. 2005, available online at http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/cricket/england/4192306.stm, accessed 26 Dec. 2006. 4. Being authentic is holding the attitude that I engage in my projects as my own. One is inauthentic if one acts in such a way from a sense of duty (because it is what 'good' people or 'upstanding' citizens do), whereas, acknowledging that one freely chooses to act in a particular way (not because it is what one is expected to do) is to be authentic. Authenticity involves a transparency, in an acceptance that we, as humans, are beings who are wholly responsible for ourselves. In this, it could be argued that authenticity is a moral category, in promoting integrity and a recognition of the human condition. 5. As indicated earlier, this is the only thing one can say about a human essence or nature. 6. In this then, falling into bad faith and being authentic are not necessarily dependently related concepts. We may be in good faith while being authentic and we may be in good faith while being inauthentic, and contrary, we may be in bad faith while being inauthentic or in bad faith while being authentic. One does not necessarily presuppose the other. However, in certain situations there may be a relationship between the two, in that being inauthentic implicitly encourages falling into bad faith brought about by a pre-reflective attempt to be an 'in-itself'. 7. As given by Sartre in Existentialism and Humanism (1973). 8. As given by Sartre in Being and Nothingness (1958). 9. This idea is explored most fully in Sartre's play No Exit or Huis Clos (1944) and is exemplified in his famous phrase 'ell is other people'. 10. Heidegger expressed this 'Être-pour-autrui' or being-for-others. 11. There are occasions when these emotions are different – when being named in the squad is a source of pride and confidence (for example, if it is the first time one wears one's national shirt). Yet this merely emphasises Sartre's claim that one is in bad faith in sincerely playing the role of a substitute as an object in-itself. 12. In this mantra, Sartre emphasises that in being free, we carry the weight of the world on our shoulders. It is only as a result of our existence that there is a world for us to be confronted with and through this confrontation we are left with a freedom whereby we create ourselves; it therefore makes no sense to complain that the world is the way it is. 13. This could be her most skilful, mentally tenacious or physically dominant players; depending on what the coach believed to be important attributes or characteristics that would lead to the desired state of affairs in the game (i.e. winning). 14. Indeed, Sartre argued that it is with one's death that one's facticity – or one's purpose – becomes ultimately determined by others and not by oneself. 15. As noted by Camus in The Myth of Sisyphus. 16. This suggests a similarity to Wittgenstein's notion of 'attitude' in ethics. In a sense, the facts are irrelevant; one could always argue that our behaviour is highly influenced, determined even, by our genes or other physical or social causes but the point is that we hold the 'attitude' that we are free. This gives us credibility in being human: it is to take responsibility for one's being. To be authentic involves a sense of autonomy: to be resolute in committing to a course of action, rather than to merely occupy a role or place.",

      "title": "Regret and irrational action",
      "abstract": "Regret, like guilt and fear, seems in a fundamental respect different from such emotions as amusement and disgust. Whereas amusement presents itself as a response to some sui generis form of value, the funny, regret seems to concern something with which we're already deeply concerned, quite independently of our tendencies to regret. What we regret, paradigmatically, are our bad choices or actions: Our mistakes, in a word. That is not to say that we can only regret mistakes, or only acts we take to be mistaken; but this is clearly the standard case. In the sense of regret on which we will focus here, it involves reproaching oneself for a decision, and it functions to motivate the agent to try to undo the action if possible and to act differently next time. Though it makes sense to lament an unlucky outcome or a poor set of options, if one decided well then regret would be inapt (though not impossible) to feel. Regret seems to be about something even a rational but disaffected alien, who was immune to regret, would care about: roughly, making bad decisions. By contrast, such an alien would have no interest, except perhaps anthropological interest, in the funny or the disgusting. Call this concern for mistakes the intentional aspect of regret.",

      "title": "Embodiment, Reason and Diversity/Pluralism",
      "abstract": "To be able to account for the human experience of reason and embodiment we need the dimension of the other. Levinas provides us with this dimension. We have evidence to demonstrate that reason is plural and that a pluralistic reason works. A pluralistic reason shows how diversity is strength rather than a threat. In Levinas, we see how ethical concerns bring us to metaphysical exteriority, where the orthodox opposition between theory and practice evaporates in the face of a metaphysical transcendence that establishes the “absolutely other” as truth. The theoretical exercise of thought does not monopolize transcendence any longer. We do not have an intellectual knowledge or comprehension of the Other; rather, through the phenomena of language, desire, and concern for justice the Other challenges and calls our self-complacency into question. This activity of the Other holds our excesses in check, calls us to order, and so founds reason. True, one’s relation with the Other, who questions the “brutal spontaneity” of one’s egoistic behaviours, initiates within one a new experience of oneself (Levinas, 1969, 203). Yet this response to one’s irresponsible and irrational freedom halts violence and irrationality, and, in so doing also, “founds Reason.” The totalizing thinking aims at absorbing all Otherness into its total system of harmony and order. It intends to have a general knowledge of the Other and of everything in order to put them into one of its categories and to give them a place in its egocentric world. It aims at categorizing with a view to manipulating (Levinas, 1969, 12-18). To reject the self-centered totalizing project of systematic metaphysics is not to break with systematic/orderly thinking or to break with rationalism. It is instead to be authentically rational. Levinas shows that though the Other is other than we are, he does not negate us, as Hegel and his proponents would have us believe. Levinas’s middle way proffers us an Other-regarding solution that values and respects the Other in our behaviour, thought, and speech. This way of thinking rejects the traditional idea that reason has no plural.",

      "abstract": "The familiar idea we have about privacy is the separation from others eyes or concern. But, in 1970s Irwin Altman, social psychologist, defined privacy as process of interpersonal boundary regulation. He interpreted it as a dialectic process, which involves both a restriction of interaction and a seeking of interaction. An optimum state of privacy is reached when the desired privacy is equal to the achieved one. If achieved privacy is lower than desired privacy, there comes the sense of crowding. In case of contrary situation, we feel isolated. Desired privacy changes over time depending on situation and a person continue feedback loop until desired privacy is achieved. Under difficult condition, this process requires much energy expenditure. If the same status lasts, diverse physiological and psychological problem shall occur. Single-person household rapidly growing in recent years has a difficulty in the regulation of privacy. Because the environment surrounding their house does not have spatial layers which allow to choose different social interactions depending on their psychological conditions. The Sense of isolation coming from the failure of privacy regulation results in elevated stress, cardiovascular diseases, or lowered attention span. Therefore, the existence of public spaces such as parks is important. Because agreeable public spaces can give a place of mind to single residents, so they can expand their boundary of interaction with outer circumstances at residential areas. As well, oxytocin is a hormone to relieve the above-mentioned symptoms by either smoothing mind or forming fellowship. Studies on space to stimulate the release of oxytocin could be one of solutions to lessen the sense of isolation.",

Mental reports fall into different categories. Some report something of a dispositional nature – they do not imply anything about the person's present state of consciousness. Reports of someone's beliefs seem to be of this kind, as do reports of his likes and dislikes. To say that at a certain time one person liked cheese and another person disliked cheese is not to say anything about their actual states of consciousness at that time – about their actual experiences, or thoughts, or feelings. Such statements could be true of them even if they were not conscious at that time at all – for instance, if they were asleep.",

      "abstract": "This research identifies and classifies environment capabilities by reviewing environmental psychology as well as analyzing and defining environments based on different theories. Identifying and applying these capabilities in designing ideal and high quality educational environments in terms of structure leads to a deliberate and thoughtful architecture. To briefly explain the concept of capability, it can be said that environment capabilities are the physical configuration belongings of a behavioral object or place that makes it usable for certain activities. Some demands are met by an environment or object, live or cultural, easier than others; some activities which are formed in a specific configuration of environment meet some people needs and do not others. The important thing is that the capabilities of a physical environment, whether good or bad, is what the environment suggests with its configuration characteristics and materials it is made of. It seems that the quality of an object can be defined as “a set of specific characteristics or traits which distinguish one object from others and enable us to judge about superiority, similarity or inferiority of something in comparison to something else, and from esthetical aspect judge and give a verdict about being ugly or beautiful, good or bad, as well as its goodness or badness and efficiency or inefficiency with regard to functionality. In this article, by studying environment elements and capabilities and reviewing some qualitative elements and parameters in designing educational spaces and urban environments, we attained two generalized models for environmental capabilities and qualitative parameters in designing educational spaces. Finally, in the first model, two series of indicators were categorized in form of a single model including principal environment capabilities and environment physical capabilities. In the second model, qualitative parameters of environment design are divided into superficial, real and mental components and according to the obtained results, the environment receives mental qualities from environment only if the capacity components are considered in designing correctly and with high quality.",

      "abstract": "I have argued that, in order to unearth — or construct — sociological foundations for Marx's economic theories, the two concepts of estrangement and alienation must be kept separate and distinct. In the Introduction, 'alienation' (Entäusserung) was said to refer to the renunciation or relinquishment of possession or of a claim to something — usually, but not necessarily, in favour of another person. Its correlative was said to be 'appropriation' (Aneignung): taking into possession or assuming new powers of disposal over something — often, but by no means always, from another person. Clearly, neither term refers exclusively to relations involving 'things', since it is possible to alienate and appropriate activities or capacities, such as labour and labour-power, or persons (slaves) or abstract social entities (privileges, offices, freedoms, 'goodwill' etc.) However, it is fair to say that their primary reference is to things, and that these other uses, however common, are secondary, and have a figurative content. Or, to put it another way, that these diverse sorts of object are being assimilated to things and treated accordingly when they are said to be alienated or appropriated. So whereas solidarity and estrangement concerned the social bonding and sundering of persons, appropriation and alienation concern the making and breaking of social bonds between persons and things.",

Such a pessimistic point of view, however, did not affect Seneca’s optimism.

Oracles and curses mention famine as a future-conditional event. This paper focuses on a subgroup of texts announcing not only famine and aggregate food-supply shortfalls but expressing the abolition of the regular order and the connection between deed and punishment (e. g., people will plant but never enjoy the fruits, they will eat but never have enough, etc.). While in the so called indictment/judgment oracles (e. g. Hos 4:10–11; Am 4:6–8; 5,10–11; Mic 6:9–16; Zeph 1:12–13) the offence has already be done, in the so called “treaty curses” the punishment will only be fulfilled in case of violation of the inscription (Statue from Tell Feḫerīye; Bukān Stela), the treaty (Sfīre Stela) or the covenant (Lev 26:14–39; Deut 28:15–44). In either case the emotion of fear plays an important part. These dystopian texts (“futility curses”) convey a warning predicting a bleak future and in some cases the expectation of the future even surpasses what has been experienced in the past by stressing the futility of action.",

Few textbooks even index the term. To help remedy this odd neglect, the author postulated the protective motive as a biologically given “thrust to wholeness,” modified by experience and dependent on social support. Utilizing mechanisms of homeostasis, defense, prevention, healing, and “outreach” (i.e., wholeness expressed), the motive disposes the individual to maintain and express the functional integrity of body and self (including “all that is mine”). Seemingly unrelated phenomena (e.g., immune response, quest for immortality, forgiveness, sharing, urge to procreate) are thus afforded common explanation. Prospectively, the thrust to wholeness affords conceptual unity, parsimony, and pedagogical utility. Also, it may furnish a conceptual anchor for well-being and its paradoxes, self-defeat and suicide.",

      "title": "INTRODUCTION: ADVANCES IN APPRECIATIVE INQUIRY – CONSTRUCTIVE DISCOURSE AND HUMAN ORGANIZATION",
      "abstract": "Appreciative Inquiry is a constructive inquiry process that searches for everything that “gives life” to organizations, communities, and larger human systems when they are most alive, effective, creative and healthy in their interconnected ecology of relationships. To appreciate, quite simply, means to value and to recognize that which has value – it is a way of knowing and valuing the best in life. In the language of Positive Organizational Scholarship it means a research focus – a positive bias – seeking fresh understanding of dynamics described by words like excellence, thriving, abundance, resilience, or exceptional and life-giving (Cameron, Dutton & Quinn, 2003). In this context the word appreciate means to value those things of value – it is a mode of knowing often connected to the idea of esthetic appreciation in the arts. To appreciate also means to be grateful or thankful for – it is a way of being and maintaining a positive stance along the path of life’s journey. And not incidentally, to appreciate is to increase in value too. Combining the three – appreciation as a way of knowing, as a way of being and as an increase in value- suggests that Appreciative Inquiry is simultaneously a life-centric form of study and a constructive mode of practice. As a form of study, Appreciative Inquiry focuses on searching systematically for those capacities and processes that give life and strength and possibility to a living system; and as a constructive mode of practice, it aims at designing and crafting human organizations through a process in which valuing and creating are viewed as one, and where inquiry and change are powerfully related and understood as a seamless and integral whole. But the key to really understanding Appreciative Inquiry is to put the emphasis on the second word in the inseparable pair. While many are intrigued with the Appreciative Inquiry positive bias – toward the good, the better, the exceptional, and the possible – it is the power of inquiry we must learn more about and underscore. Inquiry is all about openness, curiosity, creative questioning; its spirit involves what Whitehead once called “the adventure of ideas.”",

      "title": "MURDER WITHOUT APPARENT MOTIVE: A STUDY IN PERSONALITY DISORGANIZATION",
      "abstract": "In this paper we have described a number of common characteristics found in individuals who have committed impulsive senseless murders. These characteristics were: severe weakness of impulse control; blurring of the boundaries between fantasy and reality, with periods of altered states of consciousness; blunted and shallow emotional reactions; and a violent and primitive fantasy life. This constellation seems to have grown out of a history characterized by extreme parental violence and early severe emotional deprivation. In these cases, there appeared an ego weakness which allowed the periodic breakthrough of intense aggressive impulses, sometimes of homicidal proportion. When such apparently senseless murders occur, they are seen to be an end result of a period of increasing tension and disorganization in the murderer starting before the contact with the victim who, by fitting into the unconscious conflicts of the murderer, unwittingly serves to set into motion his homicidal potential. It remains a task of future research to: 1. Differentiate these individuals from other murderers as well as from others with similar disturbances but who do not kill; 2. Weigh the significance of the individual factors described; 3. Devise measures for identifying and effectively controlling these individuals before they commit murder.",

We have focused on substance addiction in this essay because of the plethora of research on this topic. “Bliss” is a desirable human condition, but can be attained through spiritual practices, human relationships, and positive artistic, athletic, cognitive, and other activities where the possibility of addiction is still present but less likely to occur.",

      "abstract": "A variety of philosophical, religious, spiritual, and scientific perspectives converge on the notion that everything that exists is part of some fundamental entity, substance, or process. People differ in the degree to which they believe that everything is one, but we know little about the psychological or social implications of holding this belief. In two studies, believing in oneness was associated with having an identity that includes distal people and the natural world, feeling connected to humanity and nature, and having values that focus on other people's welfare. However, the belief was not associated with a lower focus on oneself or one's concerns. Participants who believed in oneness tended to view themselves as spiritual but not necessarily religious, and reported experiences in which they directly perceived everything as one. The belief in oneness is a meaningful existential belief that has numerous implications for people's self-views, experiences, values, relationships, and behavior.",

The problem is that not all humans are persons in terms of general secular morality. To be a person for secular morality, one must be able to give morally authoritative permission. Or, to put matters somewhat differently, only those entities who can give permission, who can convey moral authority concerning themselves and their possessions will be termed persons. Person in the strict sense will be used to identify those entities who can establish by their agreements a web of moral authority for their collaboration, or who can refuse to be involved with others. Persons in the strict sense are the active participants in the morality that can bind moral strangers, for only persons can negotiate their areas of joint labor and by their refusals set limits to the intrusions of others. As such, per sons in the strict sense are moral agents who may be held responsible for their actions.",

Like the latter, it resolves unfinished business rather than initiating new business-and in this important respect it differs from the relaxant finale, which insists (albeit without precluding thematic connections with other movements) on its autonomous status. In an aesthetic sense, however, it could not differ more sharply from both other types. It is slow rather than fast, calm rather than agitated, introverted rather than extroverted, soft rather than loud. It favors regression as against cumulating, simplicity as against artifice.",

      "title": "Love and Moral Structures",
      "abstract": "This entry sketches ways in which placing love at morality's center—where love is conceived as various forms of good will—can point the way to a number of attractive and new (or neglected) options for moral theorists. These include treating virtues as internal and basic to both duty and value; relativizing all our moral virtues, obligations, and so on, to certain role-relationships we fill in persons' lives; focusing on actions' and attitudes' \"patients\" (understood as the people to whom anyone's occupying such relationships connects); and morally categorizing actions, including whether they are obligatory, forbidden, or merely permitted on the grounds of their agents' motivations rather than the actions' results. Such virtues basing, as we can call it, offers an appealing alternative to seeing either duty or the valuable as conceptually basic, and, indeed, regarding love as the form of our major moral virtues helps answer enduring questions about how to analyze each of them. Similarly, love is always of someone, the beloved (object of love) and, when theorists focus on these patients of loving actions, seeing the action's licitness as its lovingness to that Other within the role, they can recognize the real determinants of moral status not in self-interest, nor in optimization of the world condition, but in the agent's resolve to act helpfully. Likewise, as virtues, the various forms of love such as truthfulness (that is, willing one's auditor the good of true belief) or respect (i.e., willing someone such goods of personhood as self-governance) are features having which tends to make the loving person good within one or more of her relevant role-relationships: a good friend, for instance, or good as a spouse, or simply a good \"neighbor\" in the Christians' sense. That suggests a relational conception of moral life wherein any virtue or vice or duty that someone has is one that she has in some person-to-person role. In addition, whether an action, or emotional reaction, is loving is shaped by what is the moral subject's and agent's mind; such an input-driven account of actions' morality stands against any even partially consequence-dependent account of moral right and wrong. These options involve moral structures in either the sense that they reveal the logical structure of an important kind of moral judgment, or the sense that they disclose which, among the moral concepts and judgments, stand as fundamental and which derive from those bases.",

      "title": "External Locus of Control, Problem-Focused Coping and Attempted Suicide",
      "abstract": "It may be argued that suicidal behavior comprises three major manifestations: suicidal ideation, which is the process of thinking about committing suicide; suicide attempt, which is the process where an individual tries to commit suicide but is not successful; and completed suicide, the process of successfully ending one's life. Although these three processes can easily be viewed as a linear sequence, it must be noted that they do not occur in an unbroken stream. Many people entertain suicidal thoughts, but never reach the point where they feel compelled to act on these thoughts, nor will all unsuccessful attempters try again (and again) until they are successful, and not all completed suicides have a history of attempts (Kessler, Borges & Walters, 1999; Pirkis, Burgess & Dunt, 2000). Because the three modes of suicidal behavior do not form an automatic, inevitable chain of events, it could be argued that individuals who attempt or complete suicide must differ in some respect from those who do not move beyond suicidal thinking. Investigating differences between suicidal ideators and completed suicides is not easily accomplished unless there is sufficient information available about the deceased to permit psychological autopsies. However, studying differences between ideators and attempters is feasible because members of both groups are available for consultation. The present study compared suicidal ideators and attempters in the context of Lazarus' (1966) theory of stress and coping. More specifically, the investigation assessed the extent to which the two groups differ in terms of their locus of control orientation and level of problem-focused coping they use when faced with stress. In life there are many unusual, unpleasant, and threatening experiences which put people under stress. If that stress is too severe or if it is perceived as such, it can lead to damaging psychological effects. Lazarus (1966) suggested that perception of threat is influenced not only by characteristics of the stimulus but also by characteristics of the perceiving individual. One of these personal factors is the individual's locus of control orientation. Individuals with internal locus of control perceive the outcomes of their lives as resulting from their own behavior, whereas people with external locus of control attribute control to chance, fate, or powerful others (Levenson, 1981). Individuals who attribute control to external factors perceive the world differently than those who believe that they have personal control. Externals are more prone to perceive threat because they believe that they lack control, whereas internals tend to see situations as controllable and therefore perceive less threat. When people are confronted with stress they face two challenges: meeting the requirements of the stress situation and protecting the self from psychological disorganization (Lazarus, 1993, 2000). When they feel competent to handle the stress, they may opt for problem-focused coping; when they doubt their own competencies, emotion-focused coping may prevail. Those who use problem-focused coping likely approach stress as a problem to be solved; they move from merely thinking and worrying about their difficulties to actively taking steps to deal with them, thereby reducing stress. In the present study it was speculated that external locus of control and limited problem-focused coping skills may tip the balance between merely thinking about suicide and attempting suicide. Most suicidal behavior occurs in the context of recent, often severe life stress (Bonner & Rich, 1988; de Man, 1988a,b; de Man, Balkou & Iglesias, 1987; de Man, Leduc & Labreche-Gauthier, 1993; Farmer & Creed, 1989; Zimmerman, Pfohl, Stangle & Coryell, 1985) which generates feelings of threat and requires a coping response. Individuals with internal locus of control and good problem-focused coping skills generally will feel that they can do something constructive, and as a result appraise the situation as less threatening. …",

To begin with, it will seem all too clear that what we are dealing with is a human invention, a ‘fiction’ constructed by men for their own purposes-an interpretation which we can never quite give to the religion of our own culture, even if we have rejected it. To make that assumption will not help us to understand though it may boost our sense of superiority. And secondly, there is the difficulty, if not the impossibility, of avoiding thinking about someone else’s religion as a kind of exercise in ‘decoding’, in translating myth and ritual into a ‘natural’ language (our own, of course) in which these things can be made to yield their true sense, which may be hidden from those who carry out the rituals and who recount the myths.",

Eight psychosomatic and extended cognitive functions working as an interactive whole are proposed to constitute self-consciousness: (1) somatic domain and body image; (2) situation and domestic range; (3) agency and power to act; (4) introspection, mindfulness, and metacognition; (5) first person discourse and appropriation; (6) episodic memory, autobiography, and role; (7) attribution and alterity; (8) conscience, moral consciousness, and ethical stance. These functions, complemented with considerations about depersonalization and selflessness, are briefly defined and described. These subsystems may work independently but they may interact and variably coalesce according to the demands of the task. Since self-awareness would require a dynamic swarm-like activation pattern of the cluster, the self does not reside in particular brain sites or networks but depends on top-down and bottom-up mechanisms coupled with incoming and outgoing sensory-motor data loops. This psychophysical theory avoids the swing between internal and external elements in favor of an embracing I-World patterned process that comprises neural, bodily, behavioral, environmental, and social dimensions converging in the construction and expression of self-conscious and personal identity experiences integrated by a participant brain.",

Before we can enter into any thing which deserves to be called a general and systematic view of nature, it is necessary that we should possess an enumeration, if not complete, at least of considerable extent, of her materials and combinations; and that those which appear in any degree important should be distinguished by names which may not only tend to fix them in our recollection, but may constitute, as it were, nuclei or centres, about which information may collect into masses.

It defends the idea that whether a person or thing counts as biased can be a relative matter and offers preliminary discussions of the phenomena of higher-order bias (or bias about bias) and biased representation. Finally, it explores the relationships between biased wholes and biased parts. It argues that a group might be biased even if all of its individual members are unbiased, and that, conversely, a group might be unbiased even if its members are severely biased.",

      "title": "Freud, Sigmund (1856–1939)",
      "abstract": "Freud developed the theory and practice of psychoanalysis, one of the most influential schools of psychology and psychotherapy of the twentieth century. He established a relationship with his patients which maximized information relevant to the interpretation of their behaviour, and this enabled him to find explanations of dreams, symptoms and many other phenomena not previously related to desire. In consequence he was able radically to extend our common-sense psychology of motive. On Freud’s account everyday actions are determined by motives which are far more numerous and complex than people realize, or than common-sense understanding takes into account. The most basic and constant motives which influence our actions are unconscious, that is, difficult to acknowledge or avow. Such motives are residues of encounters with significant persons and situations from the past, often reaching back to early childhood; and they operate not to achieve realistic satisfaction, but rather to secure a form of pacification through representation. When we interpret what others say and do we apply these patterns of satisfaction and pacification to explain their behaviour; and in so far as we succeed in understanding others in this way we support the patterns as empirical generalization. While we recognize that pacification consequent on genuine satisfaction is deeper and more lasting than that effected by representation alone, we also know that human desire outruns opportunities for satisfaction to such an extent that pacification via imagination is common. This is a view which psychoanalysis radically extends. This understanding of the mind enabled Freud to give psychological accounts of neurosis and psychosis, and to explicate how the past gives significance to the present in normal mental functioning. Past desires, even those of infancy, are not psychologically lost; rather they are continually re-articulated through symbolism, so as to direct action towards their representational pacification throughout life. In this Freud provides both a radically holistic account of the causation of action and a naturalistic description of the generation of meaning in life. New goals acquire significance as representatives of the unremembered objects of our earliest and most visceral passions; and the depth of satisfaction we feel in present accomplishments flows from their unacknowledged pacification of unknown desires from the distant past. Thus, paradoxically, significant desires can remain forever flexible, renewable and satisfiable in their expressions, precisely because they are immutable, frustrated and unrelenting at the root.",

It suggests that the opposite of Evil is the word itself backwards, that is, ‘Live’. In other words, reverse Evil and we have Live. Living is about loving (whole object relating) and working (being creative). Freud said that a normal person should be able to love and to work—‘Lieben und Arbeiten’ (Erikson, Childhood and Society , 1965, p. 256), which meant that the individual would not be so preoccupied with work productiveness ‘to the extent that he loses his right or capacity to be a genital and loving being’ (Erikson, p. 256). In this paper, the author considers the word ‘Live’—living in its fullest form of loving and working to be the counterpart to a non‐life dominated by the grip of destructiveness and evil thoughts.

      "abstract": "Jealous love and morbid jealousy, although inextricably linked, cannot be considered the same: jealous love (trait jealousy) is the behavioral and cognitive-affective precondition of morbid jealousy (state jealousy). Love is jealous when it is devoured by the desire for the exclusive and total possession of the partner, whose unconditional and continued presence is avidly requested. This type of love, in addition, is permeated by the need to know what the other is thinking, in order to scrutinize every minimal flaw in the faithfulness of the partner even in his or her innermost thoughts and fantasies; in it, jealousy is virtually always present, even in the absence of a triggering event, because captative love, by its very nature, includes the expectation of a conflict which inevitably actually takes place in reality. Finally, jealousy emerges as an emotional event (jealous flash) in response to a more or less significant change in the behavior of the partner, and reveals to the jealous individual a dimension which was previously latent or inexistent. This intense and brief experience, leaves a more or less blurred memory behind, and tends to progressively repeat itself and take root as a feeling.",

      "title": "How to make sense of suffering in complex care practices?",
      "abstract": "This chapter focuses on the tension between complexity of caring practices and the normative dimension of providing good care. The question we raise in this chapter is whether practice theory provides conceptual space for the good of the patient, being a vulnerable person, longing for cure and support in dire times, receiving care under conditions of complexity? Our answer is that this is possible, by considering the epistemological and moral position of a patient as someone dealing with illness and social vulnerability as well ('precarity'). The very character of being a patient is that he or she is suffering. Suffering, however, is not specific to patients. As the French philosopher Paul Ricoeur puts it, suffering and more broadly being the subject of forces displays what is common to all humans. People are 'passible': they constantly undergo processes, they are subject to time and material circumstances, such as heat, light and air pressure (Ricoeur, 1986: 125). People also constantly undergo acts of other people (pep talk, admonishments, putting a needle in one's back for diagnostic reasons, caressing fingers). And people undergo diseases. Of course some diseases are self-inflicted. But even then, when the disease is raging or slumbering in the body, people undergo it: they feel the contractions, the throbbing pain, the itching. People are also actors but with the constant reality of being 'passible'. Thus Ricoeur balances his idea of human agency with his observation that people are sentient beings undergoing situations, time and space; they are both subjects and objects and often at the same time. The neologism passibilité points at something different than passivity. When passivity means remaining without action, passibility does indicate movements: inner movements, even if people are not always consciously aware of them. Undergoing evokes inner movements: repulsion, attraction, contraction etcetera. In ethics this interplay of action and undergoing realities is a major shift: what if human acts are not just reigned by intention, decision, will, by principles, by duty, by rational accounts of consequences but by mere passibility as well? We thus propose that it is not evident that a patient is an actor in care practices similar to the acting roles of nurses, physicians, care managers; patients should not be seen as co-players in this field.In this chapter, we will take up the issue of whether the passibility and vulnerability of patients can be weaved in a practices oriented conceptualization of complex care. While our aim is to offer a conceptual contribution to practice theory, our considerations are based on five years of qualitative empirical research (2009-2014) of the first two authors in a general hospital in the Netherlands. As care ethicists, we were (and are) interested in how good care can come about and how it can turn, in an instant, into bad care (see Tronto 1993 and Held 2006 on the philosophical ethics of care and caring). We have shadowed patients waiting for hours in the emergency room; we have witnessed astonishingly good care and unnecessary incriminating acting by one and the same physician on the very same day; we observed the use of high tech and physicians at particular moments relying on more classical experience based diagnostics; we shadowed and interviewed nurses on their rounds distributing medicine while using a computerized safety system, pointing to just one example of the prominent role of materiality in care practices. Complexity became a more and more predominant issue during our observations. Standing explanations from organization theory, interesting as they are, were not satisfying, as suffering of patients or even 'harm added by care' (Van Heijst, 2011) were absent in them. If an organization is an arrangement of things, people, ideas or activities (Hatch, 2011) the lack of any telos, and the absence of any conceptualization of the substance of the work, and the experiences that it brings about, render that definition problematic. Such a formal definition of an organization is theoretically weak: that what is done and what is experienced seems irrelevant (cf. Pellegrino, 2001). As Lyotard has analysed there is no such thing as a 'nil institution', an organization defined as devoid from content. Thus, the presence of patients constitute the carework in a hospital, they are not just add-ons to an already existing, morally neutral organization. As we were sceptical of theories concentrating on complexity that leave out the substance of care and the normative, we were looking for a theory that could serve us better as a heuristic tool for our research. We needed a theory that could help to dig up matters of concern to those working and being ill in the hospital organization and which is also capable of capturing issues of complexity and normativity. How could caring, suffering and the high complexity of the late modern hospital be adequately theorized? We side with Annemarie Mol (2003) as she emphasizes 'that what is enacted' in an organization. However, we do not concentrate, as she does, on the enactment of the body multiple or perhaps disease multiple in various care practices in which health care is leading. Rather, we wanted to understand the very nature of being a patient: the one who is suffering, undergoing both the disease and the care practice. We are interested in the complaints and concerns of patients as they come for assistance and help to doctors, nurses, physiotherapists, nutrition experts, and we are interested in the actions of the care professionals as they take place in the highly complex setting of the hospital too. Any theory that is of heuristic value to our research would",

These meetings have the potential to facilitate processes of mutual recognition and the development of multiple selves, on one hand, but may also lead to collapse of the potential space and experiences of destruction, on the other. Group and individual processes of recognition and destruction may be dramatic and require special coping on the part of the leader (mainly in situations of impasse), or they may be more subtle, almost unnoticeable. Both in the case of the big dramas and in the case of the little dramas, the possibility for surrender, for movement toward unfamiliar areas within one or more of the participants, is what furthers the group's development. In the current paper, I apply intersubjective concepts to group work and, more precisely, propose a way of looking at how the group and the group leader can act to expand the intersubjective space in order to enable processes of destruction and recognition to coexist without the potential space collapsing.",

Vulnerability is no longer restricted to the domain of the badly-integrated or excluded, it touches the whole of the social world. Vulnerability as being specific to the responsible human being, a vulnerability of a moral nature, as it were, and vulnerability making it impossible for a person to appear to the world, in other words a vulnerability of a social nature. Responding to the potential vulnerability of the other person, is the vulnerability of he who responds and who not only 'always has one response more to give' but a responsibility which is inexhaustible.",

      "abstract": "The author reports on four experiments he conducted to obtain perceivers’ reactions to selected objects not made as art objects that because of the method and/or location of their display would lead one to expect them to be art objects. He found that perceivers trained in an older, ‘romantic’, more affective orientation were the most disturbed when they felt that the sacred space of a museum or gallery was violated. Those accustomed to perceiving events in galleries as a species of intellectual game were not disturbed—they accepted the notion that innovations in aesthetic experience might be performed at any point in the experience: in the objects, in the physical setting, in the definition of roles, in the relations between originator and recipient, anywhere.\n\t His experiments lead him to conclude that the art world (in its broadest aspects in, for example, Canada) is the prime institutional realm in which innovators can experiment with symbols of thinking and feeling and action as much as they like, and with the least risk of life, sustenance or anything else the society usually regards as serious and important.\n\t L’auteur rend compte de quatre experiences auxquelles il a procede dans le but de determiner les reactions d’un spectateur devant un certain choix d’objets qui n’etaient pas faits expressement comme des objets d’art, mais qui en raison de leur emplacement et de la maniere dont ils etaient presentes, ameneraient le spectateur a croire qu’il s’agissait d’objets d’art. Il constata que les sujets eleves dans une optique plus traditionnelle, ‘romantique’, affective, etaient les plus troubles quand l’espace sacre d’un musee ou d’une galerie etait viole. Ceux qui etaient habitues a considerer ce qui se passe dans les galeries d’art comme une sorte de jeu intellectuel n’etaient pas troubles. Ils acceptaient le fait que des innovations esthetiques puissent etre faites dans n’importe quel domaine de l’experience: dans les objets, dans l’environnement, dans la definition des roles, dans les relations entre le createur et le spectateur, n’importe ou.\n\t Ses experiences l’amenent a la conclusion que le monde des arts (dans ses aspects les plus larges, au Canada par exemple) est le premier royaume institutionnel dans lequel les innovateurs peuvent experimenter autant qu’ils veulent a l’aide de symboles de pensee, de sentiments et d’action, et sans mettre en danger la vie, ni la subsistance, ni tout ce que la societe considere habituellement comme etant serieux et d’importance.",

      "abstract": "A person may redress a wrong by harming the transgressor, or by harming someone with whom the transgressor has a vital CS relationship. Suicide and self-harm take both forms, sometimes simultaneously. Thus, Annie may kill herself because she has violated a relationship that only her self-punishment can redeem, or she may kill herself to punish Bill who has transgressed against her, but who loves her and will suffer when she kills herself. In either case there are often important metarelational motives at work. Hurting or killing oneself may restore the collective honor of one’s primary CS group, such as family or military unit. Suicide and self-harm may also show that one accepts full individual responsibility for failure, so third parties should not blame anyone else. In other metarelational processes, Annie’s suicide to punish Bill’s transgression against Annie may make George, who loves Annie, hate Bill, or at the very least shame Bill by drawing George’s and others’ attention to the gravity of Bill’s transgression against Annie. Similarly, like Lucretia’s suicide after being raped by Sextus, it may spur others to avenge a grave transgression. More recently, Tibetan monks’ suicide by setting themselves on fire to protest Chinese rule over Tibet and repression of Buddhism have put great moral pressure on China, and in 2010 Mohammed Bouazizi’s suicide by fire in Tunisia brought out masses of protestors who overthrew the government.",

The following passage will serve as an example of what I mean: To talk of a person’s mind is not to talk of a repository which is permitted to house objects that something called ‘the physical world’ is forbidden to house; it is to talk of the person’s abilities, liabilities and inclinations to do and undergo certain sorts of things, and of the doing and undergoing of these things in the ordinary world, (p. 199) I call this passage unhelpful because it commits the fallacy of false alternatives. It would have us think that talk of a person's mind is either (1) talk of a special non-physical repository or else (2) talk of a person's abilities, liabilities, inclinations, etc.—but not both. Yet surely talk of the mind as a non-physical repository might be one way of talking about a person's abilities, liabilities, inclinations, etc. Perhaps what Ryle should have said is that to speak of the mind as a non-physical repository that houses special, mental objects is a figurative way of putting what could be reported literally in talk of a person’s abilities, liabilities, inclinations, etc. Certainly that is a point Ryle tries to make in his book. Indeed it is a major burden of THE CONCEPT OF MIND to identify and analyze those figures of speech, or tropes, in which mental activities and capacities are commonly reported and described. The idea seems to be that we are misled philosophically by our failure to recognize the tropological character of what we commonly say about the mind and by our naivete as to how the tropes work.",

      "title": "Hypertrophy versus Hyperplasia",
      "abstract": "Although all tissues and organs of the body are normally subject to the growth-regulating influences of functional demands, some are potentially capable of unlimited growth while others are not. This depends on whether hyperplasia of their functional units ceases prior to maturity or can continue throughout life. In the former case, further growth is limited by the extent to which hypertrophy can enhance physiological efficiency. Some of the body's most vitally essential organs (heart, brain, kidney, lung) lack the ability to make additional structural units in the adult and are therefore handicapped in compensating for the depreciations of advancing age. Theoretically, at least, other organs (glands, renewing tissues) possess unlimited powers of regeneration because they never lose the capacity (latent or expressed) for hyperplasia. There is a strategy in the way growth mechanisms have evolved. It may be significant that the so-called \"hypertrophic\" organs lose the capability for hyperplasia, because not to do so might jeopardize their growth regulation. If size is determined by functional demands, then the latter must not operate continuously lest growth go on without interruption and lead to overproduction of functional units. Only renewing tissues can tolerate perpetual growth because they get rid of excess structures as fast as they are formed. Endocrine and exocrine glands are in most cases known to function discontinuously and are thus not in danger of being overstimulated. The heart, lungs, and kidneys (and brain?), however, must work incessantly. Were their functional units capable of hyperplasia and at the same time subject to control by functional demand, then overgrowth would seem to be inevitable. By giving up the potential for hyperplasia in favor of the necessity for constant function, these organs have adopted a strategy that enables them to become hypertrophic to a limited extent while doing their jobs efficiently. It is a curious fact that the unrestricted proliferation of biological structures cannot occur at all levels of organization. The counterpart of cancer, which is a cellular phenomenon, does not exist among molecules or cytoplasmic organelles, nor is it known to occur at the histological level of organization. Even in organs made up of histological units of function and having the potential for unlimited hyperplasia (for example, liver, exocrine glands, thyroid, ovary), the population of functional units never exceeds the number needed to fulfill the physiological requirements of the body. Above and below the level of the cell, therefore, structures are not permitted to escape the constraints of functional demands which control their production. The fact that cells can occasionally do so when they become neoplastic may reveal as much as it conceals about the problem of growth regulation.",

It need not correlate with the reality to an external observer of physical or psychological disability. Psychoanalytic emphasis is directed to the motivations for the persistence of this sense of defect, rather than primarily to etiology (trauma) or genetic history. Accurate perception and evaluation, having been interdicted during childhood, is avoided with the magical hope that thereby one will be acceptable and what is wrong will disappear. The interaction between self and parents, real and fantasied, cannot be clearly known. The patient remains uncertain as to what is wrong, in whom it is located, and how it has come about. The sense of defect, physical or psychological, becomes the nidus around which much is crystallized. This is then offered up to a parent (and the superego) as an appeasement and seduction, aiming to help this parent feel better by agreeing that the child is indeed the cause of what is wrong. Dangerously destructive (and sexual) wishes are defended against and atoned for by emphasis on one's defectiveness.",

      "abstract": "A study of the development of the mind, and of its normal and abnormal processes, has been carried on, until recently, through studying man chiefly as an isolated individual.But within the past few years it has been indicated from a number of sources, that such a study is incomplete unless, at the same time, man is considered in relation to others in his group.Man does not live alone, and in isolation.He is gregarious, and his life is inseparable from the lives of others.So to learn of his mental development, he should not be studied solely as an individual, as such, but also as his life brings him into association with others.These facts have always been appreciated to some extent by a few; but Trotter, probably more than any one else, has emphasized their importance and their significance.Today, we think of man as being highly individualistic, of his thinking and acting, for the most part, independently, at least within reasonable limits.But if we look into this more closely, we realize that man is less individualistic than he appears to be.At least the majority of men do not live in complete intellectual isolation, as regards their thoughts and opinions.There are, of course, many variations in popular opinion; but as Trotter has shown, people are divided into groups, and the individual man, however radical, takes much comfort in identifying himself with one of these groups, either as a follower, or as a leader.Perhaps in earlier times, people of the nation or of the tribe conformed as a whole quite closely in matters of opinion.The difference at present may be that whereas before there was but one large group, constituting public opinion, there are now many small groups.Of course these groups are not always recognized as such.A man does not usually consider himself as belonging to any particular type or class; but as a matter of fact, intellectual or social isolation is quite exceptional.When we do meet such a person, he seems to be swimming against the stream.He has a hard time, and is not regarded in a favorable light.He is likely to be thought queer, and erratic, and his friendship is not sought.But if he collects even a few followers he is no longer an outcast; he has joined a group.It has been shown that the group, through the vehicle of public",

Because life and all activities are subordinated to spiritual ends, it is moral to allow oneself to die when efforts to prolong life will bring no significant benefit and may even make it more difficult to finish life in peace, composure, and union with God. This is not the moral equivalent of suicide, but rather an acceptance of the human condition. In making such a decision, the distinction between morally ordinary and extraordinary means is crucial and based on the patient's total good. Ordinary means are those which offer a reasonable hope of benefit without excessive expense, pain, or other inconvenience. Extraordinary means are those which cannot be obtained without excessive burden or which, if used, would not offer a reasonable hope of benefit. Whether a medical procedure is standard or experimental does not, from a moral viewpoint, affect whether it is ordinary or extraordinary. In Catholic teaching, the patient has the paramount right to decide whether life-preserving measures will be used. If the patient is unable to make this decision, then the family should make it as the patient's representative.",

      "title": "The Value of Judgments Regarding the Value of Animals",
      "abstract": "Contemporary skepticism concerning the mental within philosophy of mind and psychology certainly seems to have created hard times for ethics. Eliminative materialists like Stich (1983) attack the very foundation on which moral theories are based. Since moral theories assume a certain amount of intentionality as a building block for their legislation ofrights and obligations, any positions that could demonstrate in some form that such an assumption is unwarranted, in that beliefs, desires and mental states in general cannot be shown to exist, would seem to spell death for the ethical realm. Ifmoral theories require realism about cognitive elements and their states yet are unable to present us with the evidence that will support this requirement, then they must either give up this requirement, and accept the view that moral agents and subjects no longer have any sure footing with regard to their claims concerning moral behavior toward themselves and others, or recognize some other way on which to ground their views. Does it have to be the case, for instance, that consciousness and sentience are the only conditions on which moral status can be ascribed to beings? Or can we refer to some other condition or set of conditions? Can we perhaps expand our concept of morality to include animals yet without necessarily raising the problems associated with attributions of intentionality? The general focus of this paper, then, concerns my interest in the conditions that make moral judgments about animals true. Hence, I am concerned with moral epistemology, not axiology. In Part I, I present a cursory analysis of Stich's view concerning ascriptions of beliefs to humans as well as to animals. In Part II, I analyze Regan's arguments for why certain animals ought to be regarded as moral subjects as well as his response to Stich's position. My intention behind presenting Regan's position is twofold: (1) to show that Stich's position creates some difficulty for Regan's ultimate goal of ascribing rights to animals and (2) to point out that the comparison of animal to human belief structures is not an effective way to ground what possible claims they may have against us. I conclude on a somewhat Heideggarian note in Part III. I argue that animals and nature itself may be deserving of some moral recognition just by virtue of the fact that they afford us possibilities with respect to what we can and do become. Value, in a certain sense, is to be found external to ourselves.",

Our most intimate knowledge of time comes from the flow of events in our subjective consciousness, with all its vagaries and fluctuations; but we begin to transcend mere subjectivity when we start correlating our experiences with those of others. In this way we can identify intersubjectively invariant features of time and can recognize in what respects our personal experience agrees with or contradicts that of others. From here we can move on to the idea of an objective flow of time, independent of any one individual’s experience, and come to see our own experience of time as an imperfect representation-a distortion-of some objective reality. When we are absorbed in some activity, time seems to rush by without our noticing, but when there is nothing to absorb us, it slows down to a snail’s pace; and when we are asleep it seems to take no time at all. All these variations we readily learn to put down to our personal misperception of an objective, uniform flow such as Newton described.",

      "abstract": "As human beings, we often have a tendency to delay action or take things seriously only when a situation becomes critical.1 Driven by circumstances, this reactive mindset reflects a lack of true freedom and intelligence of mind. It signifies carelessness and indifference rather than thoughtful awareness. In contrast, nature and the cosmos inherently operate in perfect harmony and order—the very term cosmos means order. Yet, human societies, with the structures we have created, are often characterized by disorder. The existence of the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals2 (SDGs) is a testament to the immense disorder we have generated in various forms. At the same time, the global commitment to sustainability reflects a shared desire to address and rectify this disorder.3 However, the demands of business and modern life often place us in conflict with this goal, forcing compromises that challenge our progress. Sustainability is fundamentally about recognizing the environmental costs of our actions. At its core, it acknowledges that the environment is not separate from us; it is an intrinsic part of who we are. We originate from the environment, are nourished by it, and eventually return to it, while future generations continue this cycle. Sustainability calls for a shift in perspective: moving beyond immediate goals and necessities to cultivate a holistic consciousness. It reminds us to view ourselves as integral to the environment, part of its ever-evolving process of life. By embracing this interconnectedness, we can act with greater awareness and responsibility, aligning our actions with the broader rhythm […]",

These are at the same time a passion for life as well as for self-destruction, for showing oneself as well for not knowing oneself, for representing oneself as well as for non representing oneself. Passion bares the impossible of mourning, its real point that gives a boost to the continual work. Passion confronts us to the essence of the being, to its fundamental distress. The being, whose shadow is projecting itself on the object of the passion, gives a name and a face to that object, and receives back its marks. That explains why passion is always accompanied by suffering. Moreover, passion is suffering according to its etymology: until the XVIth century, the word \"passionate\" meant somebody who suffered physically. The nature of the object of the passion (a relic, a part of a sentence, an indication, the track of an object or any other subject) changes nothing to the structure of the speech of passion.",

All of us, for example, have an innate capacity to experience anger, resentment, joy, happiness, sadness, hunger, thirst, and sexual attraction, among many other things. The peculiarities of one's environment determine and limit the range of which particular things will be the objects of one's desires and aversions, as well as under which particular circumstances one will feel or act on various motivations. But the desires, aversions, and motivations themselves are given by our nature. The characteristic of human nature that Smith thinks principally bears on moral standards and moral judgments is, as we have seen, the desire for mutual sympathy, though other characteristics—like one's natural partiality for oneself and the natural interest one has in the fortunes of others—play important roles as well.",

      "abstract": "Abstract As Goffman (1967) Goffman, E. 1967. Interaction ritual., Harmondsworth: Penguin. [Google Scholar] remarks: “[if] the minute social system that is brought into being with each encounter [becomes] disorganized ... participants will feel unruled, unreal, and anomic” (p.135). In other words, if we and our interlocutors are to communicate readily and easily, we rely on those with whom we are involved to sustain the sense of a collective-we between us, a shared reality that is our reality. And it is only in relation to such a shared reality that we can express to each other who we are, express the nature of our unique inner lives to each other. To an extent, we owe our very being, our identity, to it. If it collapses, then it is quite easy for us to feel unheard, or unable to express ourselves. Is there something wrong with us? Or with the world? If we are to sustain the sense of a collective-we, then we find ourselves with, as Goffman notes, certain “involvement obligations,” or “interactive responsibilities,” to our joint affairs: only if you respond to me in a way sensitive to the relations between your actions and mine can we act together as a collective-we; and if I sense you as not being sensitive in that way, that is, as not being responsive to me, but as pursuing an agenda of your own, then I will feel immediately offended in an ethical way. I will feel that you lack respect not only for our affairs, but for me too. In such circumstances, not only do I feel insulted, but I lack the social conditions necessary to express myself, the nature of my own inner life. In psychotherapy, in which it is the task of therapists to explore the unique inner lives of their clients, this is disastrous. Yet, in the pursuit of a technical agenda, it is only too easy to ignore the intrinsic “involvement obligations” present to some extent in all our exchanges with others, and as a result, to disrupt or disturb them in their very being,in who they are for us.",

Such resources may be natural, technological, or sociocultural in nature. The second dimension concerns the durability and reliability of the larger (extended) system.

But there is more to the problem than simply identifying antecedent conditions. Attributing overt behaviors to presumed covert intraorganismic functions, such as fear and hunger, requires the naming of those functions. Such naming is essentially the problem of theoretical constructs.",

      "title": "The Life Mission Theory II. The Structure of the Life Purpose and the Ego",
      "abstract": "Pursuing your life mission is often very difficult, and many frustrations are experienced along the way. Major failures to bring out our potential can cause us considerable emotional pain. When this pain is unbearable, we are induced to shift from one intention and talent to another that better allows us to adapt and survive. Thus, we become set on a course that brings out a secondary or tertiary talent instead of the primary talent. This talent displacement may be expressed as a loss of our true nature or true self. The new purpose in life now functions as the core of a new personality: the ego. The ego has a structure similar to that of the true self. It is anchored in a talent and it draws on subtalents. But the person who is centered in his or her ego is not as powerful or talented as the person he or she originally was, living the primary purpose of life. This is because the original personality (the true self or “higher self”) is still there, active and alive, behind the ego. Symptoms, disorders, and diseases may be explained by the loss of energy, joy in life, and intuitive competence because of inner conflicts, which may be alleviated or cured in the salutogenetic process of Antonovsky that helps patients find their sense of coherence or their primary purpose in life. Many cases of reduced ability to function, physically as well as psychologically, socially or sexually, can also be explained and alleviated in this way. When a person discovers his true talent and begins to use it with dedication, privately as well as professionally, his life will flourish and he may overcome even serious disease and great adversity in life. The salutogenetic process can also be called personal development or “quality of life as medicine”. It is important to note that the plan for personal development laid out by this theory is a plan not for the elimination of the ego, but for its cultivation. An existentially sound person still has a mental ego of course, but it is centered on the optimal verbal expression of the life mission. Such an ego is not in conflict with one�s true self, but supports the life and wholeness of the person, although in an invisible and seamless way. The more developed the person, the more talents are taken into use. So although the core of existence remains the same throughout life, the healthy person continues to grow. As the number of talents we can call on is unlimited, the journey ends only at death. Understanding the concept of the ego, it is very easy for the physician to motivate the patient to go through a lot of difficulties in order to grow and develop, and when the patient fully understands the concept of the ego and the true self (higher self), the patient gets a strong feeling of direction in personal development, and a motivation to fight the internal obstacles for quality of life, health, and the ability to function.",

I label it the \"utilization with welfare-safeguards\" model, or, more gently worded, \"seeking benefits while ensuring welfare.\" Some of the \"benefits\" considered are complex ones (like guiding the sight impaired) and others simpler (like reducing stress or providing affection). I explore several problems involved in this approach (including the sometimes jarring inappropriateness of \"benefit\" terminology). I then offer an alternative account where the primary moral obligation toward companion animals is to develop, nurture, respect, and protect the loving relationship between them and their human companions, since thriving in such a relationship, I claim, has become part of their evolved telos (to use Bernard Rollin's term) or evolved nature. This priority naturally leads to ensuring welfare, but the highly pro-active approach involved takes the obligation beyond standard welfare provision and \"TLC\" (\"tender loving care\"). Some implications of this position are explored.",

      "abstract": "The synchronous paradigm is a model of families whose members remain uninvolved and disconnected from each other yet somehow maintain relatively unvarying or even rigid patterns of behavior. In the synchronous paradigm, calm agreement and harmonious unity of action are valued above all. The concept of synchronous operation was first formulated by Constantine to solve certain theoretical problems growing out of the work of Kantor and Lehr. The theory has been elaborated upon through linkages established with other clinical and theoretical models of family dysfunction. Clinical experience in treating synchronous families has now contributed more detailed and practical understanding. Clinically, disabled synchronous families may present as bland, boring, or even death‐like. They may have considerable difficulty accommodating to necessary developmental changes or to the demands of life crises, employing a variety of strategies to maintain the appearance of synchrony at the expense of adaptation. Their ability to ignore change and to absorb interventions can tax the abilities of even the most creative and energetic therapist. On the other hand, the quiet efficiency of the family and the social sensitivity of its members can be strong assets. Awareness of their strengths and special vulnerabilities can help the family therapist work more effectively with synchronous families.",

      "title": "Expressions: Embodiment in the experience of design",
      "abstract": "EXPRESSIONS: EMBODIMENT IN THE EXPERIENCE OF DESIGN Products are not just objects by means of which we get things done. Apart from bringing aesthetic pleasures, for instance, they may also embody values we hold dear, communicate our fine taste to others, and help us define who we are. These widely varying functionalities are rooted in our capacity to perceive essentially lifeless forms as dynamic objects expressive of basic human experiences. This expressiveness forms the starting point for this thesis. Perceiving products as expressive in most cases comes most natural. One may readily perceive one object as distant, another as involved, and yet another as humble or proud, for instance, and at the same have an intuitive sense of what it is in a products appearance that contributes to a particular expression. However, the moment one questions why specific product features connote the expressive or figurative meanings they do, one often finds that accounting for a products expression is not always that easy or straightforward. In this thesis, we therefore seek to account for the relations between a products appearance and its expressiveness. In the first chapter different perspectives on expression are presented. This discussion revolves around the tendency, common among researchers studying product expression, to focus primarily on either the object perceived or its perceiver. In the former approach figurative or expressive characteristics are considered authentic and objective qualities, conveyed by perceptual features such as shape and size. In the latter approach these characteristics do not belong to the object but rather to the perceiver. In this line of reasoning, the objects expressiveness is primarily seen as a mental construction. Although studies originating in these approaches in one way or the other acknowledge the importance of both constituents, American philosopher John Dewey, as early as 1934, pointed out the necessity of simultaneously taking into account the contributions of both object and perceiver in studying the objects expressiveness. His notions lie at the basis of a relatively new approach that seeks to account for figurative or expressive meanings in terms of spatial-relational structures characterizing interactions between people and their environment. Since these interactions are constrained by the peculiarities of the human body, studies originating in this approach view such meanings as essentially embodied. Central to this interactional approach is the notion that specific types of interactions give rise to particular kinds of experiences. Interactions characterized by a sense of containment (e.g., seeking shelter from the storm inside a cabin, or taking refuge inside ones office to get some work done) may give rise to a sense of safety or security (for reasons of protection from threatening or disruptive influences), but at the same time to a sense of isolation from others (i.e., a container separates those inside from those outside) or constriction (i.e., a container limits ones freedom of movement). The spatial-relational structure these interactions have in common (in our example all interactions involve a bounded space in which one can be in or out) is referred to as an image schema. The central assumption of this thesis is that products can make reference to such spatial-relational structures through their visual-spatial appearance. This perceived congruence is expected to lie at the basis of the understanding of products as expressive. (Arguably, a product making reference to the containment schema is for that reason perceived as expressing degrees of security, isolation, and constriction.) In the second chapter we put this claim to a first test. Regardless of the manner in which products make reference to an image schema, ratings of products on experiences arising from the same type of interactions should be highly related. Products generally rated high on secure, for instance, should also receive high ratings on constricting (i.e., both experiences arise from interactions characterized by a sense of containment). The results of a study in which 10 chairs were rated on a wide variety of expressive characteristics were in line with this prediction. Following this confirmation, in the third chapter we explore the manner in which a product can make reference to spatial-relational (i.e., image schematic) structures through its form features. Based on a tentative discussion of the manner in which chairs and bus shelters can embody image schematic structures, in the third chapter form features of two everyday products (a jug and an alarm clock) are manipulated on the basis of the spatial-relational structure of three image schemas. Following our line of reasoning, we should be able to predict the effects of these manipulations on the objects figurative or expressive meanings. Secondly, the effects of these manipulations might be expected to show considerable consistency across cultures since interactions between people and their environment are highly similar, regardless of the region in which they take place. Our bodies, that is, show little variation, and the same applies, at least to some extent, to the environment we interact with. The results of the two experiments testing the first claim (one involving students of design, the other involving participants who had no background in design) were largely in line with our predictions. The findings from the same experiment conducted in Brazil, testing the second claim, were only partly as predicted. Having established a solid scientific basis for our project, in the fourth chapter we set out to make our approach actionable. That is, how can the insights be of practical relevance for designers intent on creating a particular expression? To provide an answer to that question we explored different ways to study the spatial-relational structures characterizing interactions giving rise to a particular experience. In one such study 11 designers were asked to design a public smoking object with a particular expression. Did these designers think of the guidelines as inspiring and useful? In order to answer these questions we discuss a questionnaire that revealed that the designers had thought of the guidelines as both inspiring and useful. However, comparison of the results of these designers to those of 11 designers receiving no special guidelines failed to confirm our prediction that the latter would be less successful in creating a particular product expression. In closing this chapter, possible explanations for this lack of differentiation are discussed. In the fifth and final chapter the most striking findings and implications of the studies discussed in previous chapters are reviewed. A large part of this chapter is devoted to a discussion of metaphor. The understanding of product expression discussed in previous chapters is metaphorical in so far as products are understood in terms of experiences that have their origin in embodied interactions in and with the environment. But not all metaphors are of this embodied type. Next to making a distinction between two types of metaphor (i.e., embodied metaphors and metaphors not, or to a lesser degree, grounded in embodied interactions), we elaborate on a fascinating aspect characterizing our understanding of the embodied metaphors discussed throughout this thesis. This understanding, we argue, presupposes an identification process by which we project our own embodied experiences onto the object via perspective taking. In closing this thesis, directions for further research are suggested. In addition, we speculate on the relevance of our findings for studies addressing facets of product experience not or sparsely discussed in this thesis, such as the expressiveness of product- materials or sounds, and the role of contextual factors.",

Finally, empathy-induced altruism can pose a threat to the mental and physical health—and even to the life—of the altruistically motivated individual.",

There is some mention of similar classification in the work of Iamblichos, but a more extensive study of these similarities in ancient Greece and present-day mediumnistic activities will be the center of another paper to be published later.The research is based on personal and verbal inquiries and on a quite extensive written questionnaire (117 questions) which was sent to spiritual professional mediums and some of the results are here mentioned, especially concerning deceased persons: the way the mediums perceive space around the entities, movements and surroundings, belongings, emotional states and the kind of messages received (nearly always the same wish to be recognized as still living). In general, mediums feel themselves relaxed when they undergo their seances, but they feel that they are in another state of consciousness, without always being able to define precisely what changed in their body or in their mind. Guides are giving another kind of message, more personal (advice for future actions) and with moral implications. High Entities can't be asked to come; when they appear very often some fear and an immense loving atmosphere are experienced simultaneously.",

But it would be a mistake to focus only on this ambiguity and confusion without examining the order and predictability that individuals also experienced. This sense of order was produced by the variety and cycle of gatherings in which participants engaged during their working day. Each day individuals were brought together in recurring as well as novel combinations by the gatherings that they were either obligated to attend (by prior commitment, due to their position at the center, etc.) or that they had themselves scheduled and/or organized. What these gatherings had in common was talk; as participants moved from a therapy session to a chat to a meeting, they continually talked to one another. Each one of the typical gatherings at Midwest was characterized by a particular pattern of speech and action as well as group expectations about what constituted \"proper\" speech and action and use of speech on these occasions, and, for the most part, everyone understood the difference between a chat and a meeting or a therapy session and a lecture. The similarities and differences, and sometimes confusion, between these types of gatherings will be discussed in detail in this and subsequent chapters.",

      "abstract": "Creativity as the source of culture In this paper the author presents human creativity as the main source of culture. Logically, it comes even from the definition of culture, understood as everything created by men (everything, which does not belong to nature). Creation by man includes the material, symbolic and societal types of culture. In the field of symbolic culture, like art, science or media, the process of creativity includes activities which result in new and valuable products. Creativity develops in the private, social and cultural domains. In the private domain an individual creates something, which is new and valuable for himself (or herself). In the social domain an individual creates something, which is new and valuable to a group, where he or she belongs. Finally, creativity in the cultural domain means creating something, which is new and valuable for all human culture. Normally it is possible through the publication or public presentation of a product, after a process of selection. Thus, normally there exists a barrier of entering this main. Creativity in the domain of culture requires not only being a creative person in the psychological sense, but also a huge amount of knowledge and practice in the specific field of activity. But by enhancing the private and social creativity, it is possible to enlarge the number of persons, which could inspire to enter the domain of cultural activity. Moreover, the true creative activity always contains the individual, private, authentic internal perspective, and is always directed to some social environment. Also, the new ways of distributing the creative products, like the Internet, makes the barrier to cultural creativity less tight, than they used to be in the past.",

      "title": "The Peculiar Temporality of Violence: a Source of Perplexity about Social Power",
      "abstract": "Abstract Most national myths of origin begin with some transcendent or sacrificial story of violent revolution, warfare or liberation. This is also true of many origin myths of ethnic, tribal or other forms of social identity. This makes it appear that some act of violence is the cause of their coming into being. This paper argues that this is an artefact of the temporal 'peculiarity' of violence. Violent events, it is argued, are essentially unpredictable even when statistically probable. This means that violence is only 'visible' after the fact, and rarely before and that plausible causal models can rarely be constructed in advance. Violence is always seen in retrospect, then, and where it has caused significant death and destruction, it requires that we begin to make sense of what caused it. Unlike other planned or and emotionally charged social interactions (such as eating, sexuality, ritual) acts of violence interrupt (disrupt, breach, rupture, break, etc.) and terminate parts or all of previous social relations. Since the cause of violence can only be assigned retrospectively, this means that we must (re-)construct the past in a way that allows us to make sense of it. Where some violent event is followed by the eventual emergence of a new identity, the new identity is often explained as having 'originated' in violence. This implies that violence caused the new social identity in some way, and that it functions as a political instrument. But violence can only create a void, and is chaotic. After violence, we require the (re-)telling of the past in a new way. This makes violence appear at the beginning of narratives of origin, but does not imply that violence caused these identities. Since large scale violence leads cultural loss and to large scale social (re)construction, narratives of identity tend to begin at these moments in time. This account of violence seeks, therefore, to undermine the notion that violence is an efficient or final cause of social forms.",

      "title": "Practical Knowledge for Monks to Abstain from Killing and Injuring Living Beings in Everyday Life with Reference to the Vinayapiṭaka and the Samantapāsādikā",
      "abstract": "The purpose of this article is to examine practical knowledge for monks (bhikkhu) to abstain from injuring and killing living beings in daily life, with reference to the Vinayapiṭaka of Theravāda and its commentary, the Samantapāsādikā.<BR> Manifestly, we cannot completely avoid causing harm throughout our entire lives, and this is also true of monks, who may harm humans and injure or kill other living beings such as animals and insects in everyday life. However, it is not every kind of killing and injuring that the Vinayapiṭaka requires monks to avoid; some do not constitute an offense.<BR> The Vinayapiṭaka has its own criteria for determining what is an offense. As is well known, the criteria involve a karmic way of thinking. Intentional injuring and killing is an offense because it creates bad karma, while actions that are unintentional are not offenses because they do not create bad karma and thus hinder the spiritual achievement.<BR> Most of us would know that this karmic way of thinking plays an important role in the judgment of criminal deeds, but few of us would precisely know the kind of injuring and killing that constitutes an offense. In actual monastic life, however, this is an important issue. No matter how well monks know the gravity of the karmic way of thinking on a theoretical basis, it does not follow from this that they can successfully discern criminal deeds. In fact, they need practical knowledge in order to avoid intentional injuring and killing.<BR> Thus, I would like to examine monastic rules related to killing and injuring as stipulated in the Vinayapiṭaka with close reference to the Samantapāsādikā and reveal practical knowledge for monks to avoid harming humans and injuring and killing other living beings in their daily lives. Specifically, I will look at Paṭhavīkhaṇanasikkhāpada (Pācittiya 10), Bhūtagāmasikkhāpada (Pācittiya 11), Sappāṇakasikkhāpada (Pācittiya 20), Sañciccasikkhāpada (Pācittiya 61), Sappāṇakasikkhāpada (Pācittiya 62), and Pahārasikkhāpada (Pācittiya 74) to show when and how these rules apply to monks and how monks can avoid breaking these rules.",

Yet they were made by artists who followed the rules of the profession: legally contracted for; made to serve a specific purpose; and destined to be seen in public. While the works are eye-catching because they involve the display sex organs and/or sexual activity, they have ulterior meanings of a higher order than at first appears. In fact, the suggestive actions depicted incorporate a self-confident vision of religion, learning, and social interaction that is fundamental to what is new in the Renaissance.",

      "abstract": "I begin with the common distinction between study which is for its own sake and study which is for some other reason. It is often assumed that when study is not for its own sake then it is for the sake of a career. But there are many and subtle ways in which a student's concern with his or her subject may be deflected from its intrinsic good. And there are ways of being concerned with its intrinsic good which are quite trivial. Therefore, if we are concerned with what may go deep in a student's life—as surely we must be if we are concerned with its ethical or spiritual possibilities—then we cannot rest with the distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic goods. A student with a vocation for healing who studies medicine in response to it, or a student who loves justice and who studies law in that spirit and with a view to practising it, is doing something finer than is a philosophy or history student who is merely enchanted with natural pleasures which come with the disciplined exercise of the powers of the mind.",

      "title": "What does it mean to be humane?",
      "abstract": "JAVMA, Vol 240, No. 5, March 1, 2012 C and misunderstanding often occur when two people attempt to communicate using different languages. More commonly, confusion arises when two people attempt to communicate using the same language but attach different meanings to the same terms. A good example is the term humane, particularly as it relates to whether the care we provide as veterinarians is humane. The term humane encompasses the best qualities of humankind, including kindness, tenderness, empathy, and compassion. Although all of these behaviors exist to some extent in various animals, animals cannot act in a humane fashion (that is, animal behavior is not judged as humane or inhumane), whereas humans can act in a humane fashion toward other humans and animals. Behavior that is inhumane is lacking in compassion for the suffering of humans and animals; synonyms of inhumanity include unkindness and cruelty. Thus, a veterinarian or animal owner who deliberately chooses to disregard available means to reduce injury or illness in an animal under his or her care could be thought of as inhumane or, in some circumstances, cruel. The definition of cruelty encompasses actions that are inhumane and without pity. The definition of pity encompasses having compassion for the suffering, distress, or troubles of another. Whether an act is cruel depends not only on the act itself, but also on the intent of the act. In my opinion, cruelty involves acts and motivations limited to people. The term welfare signifies a state of being or doing well. The concept of animal welfare has traditionally been founded on the premise that humans have an obligation to act humanely toward animals. In my experience, animal welfare problems are more likely to encompass acts of omission rather than commission (ie, deliberate acts of cruelty). The term compassion is derived from Latin and literally means to suffer with. Thus, compassion encompasses feelings, but more is involved with compassion than simply emotions. According to several modern English dictionaries, two complementary human qualities must be combined to be compassionate. First, we must have empathetic awareness of the suffering, distress, or troubles of another living being. Second, we must have an empathetic desire to help correct the problem. Empathy is the projection of our own thoughts and feelings onto the thoughts and feelings of What does it mean to be humane?",

      "abstract": "The man and his environment exist in space which has imposed evolutional development of spatial functions. The space may be taken as objective, Euclidean space or cognitive representation of the environment in the brain which is a dynamic category altered by experience. The space can be classified into corporal, gestual and visual. Spatial activity includes different types of movements of body parts or the entire body in space. Visual information plays the crucial role in spatial experience. It is processed from the retinal level to the associative cortex. Hearing is less important. Tactile and kinesthetic senses are important for the gestual space and body pattern. In the domain of spatial cognition, the capacity of abstract manipulations with spatial information is important. This includes mental rotation, orientation and selective attention. the right perietooccipital region is most important for the spatial function. Spatial tasks may be solved by verbal (more frequently in women) and visuo-spatial strategy (more common in men). Spatial agnosia is a joint term including a series of clinical phenomena such as disorder of the bodily pattern, apracto-agnostic disorders, visuospatial agnosia, visuo-perceptive disorder and conceptual spatial disorder.",

If one is not a mind-body dualist on some other grounds, it is simply good standard science to make the identification. The only reason for introducing a dimension distinct from our psychophysical utility is what gives rise to the traditional \"mind-body problem\" of the philosophers, namely, the indubitable existence of raw-feel qualities, the distinctively mental states, entities, and events. Psychophysical parallelism postulates causal sequences only within the mental and physical event series, there being no brain-mind interaction. If metaphysical dualism is not accepted, there is only one sort of event going on when a person experiences a satisfaction. In practical matters, economists talk the way a noneconomist would talk, namely, in terms of some rough idea of multiplying numbers of people by the expected average gain or loss they will suffer.",

      "title": "THE FORMATION OF SENSE & CREATIVE EXPERIENCE (Based on Critical Analysis of Edmund Husser/'s Works)",
      "abstract": "The human being lives in a meaningful (sinnvoll) world. Sense (Sinn) is an outcome of Man's spiritual activity; it is a mediator of communica­ tion, a stimulus for action, and yet it still remains among those human creations that have not been adequately analyzed. The impact of sense upon active human life is enormous. Though sense is not capable of af­ fecting physical, material things directly, it can determine understanding of an event or an object of the cultural world, and establish man's atti­ tude toward what is happening. A change in sense alters understanding of a phenomenon without affecting its material being: everything remains as it was, but acquires an entirely different sense. In a situation where sense changes human activities, they acquire a different orientation. The profoundness of sense is, indeed, striking. The sense of creations of the human mind is not confined to a single moment, an uttered word, a thought, or a realized activity; it continues to exist in history, connect­ ing past with present (as is vividly exemplified by works of Plato, Shakespeare, Dostoyevsky, and other giants of human culture) and projecting into the future to determine Man's orientation in life. However, what strikes me most, is the very process of the formation of sense in Man's creative experience, where we find the coexistence of what is given and what is created, of the unique and the unchangeable, of creation and reproduction, and of activity and passivity. The prob­ lem of sense formation involves issues of active consciousness, personal activity, the surrounding world (Umwelt), history, and truth, i.e., problems posed and tackled by phenomenology 1 in different ways, depending on the general evolutionary context of phenomenological philosophy. In Husserl's Logical Investigations several propositions are already outlined, that determine the way in which the question of sense (Sinn), which is identified with signification (Bedeutung), is stated and ap­ proached by him. Sense manifests itself in a sphere of consciousness the world of phenomena that are self-sufficient and not subject to substantional-causal relationships. The world of consciousness being",

In the second, objects are used to symbolize and materialize rules, as during eating contests where the competitors are not permitted to drink more than a glass of water.

Not in respect to his action upon phenomena: of these, so far as he knows and obeys their laws, he proves himself the master.

In places, they can point to connect representations and objects. Places may be small spaces, but spaces can contain places and even more variations. Unable to name each variation, actors and analysts create abstractions. They might use a part to represent the whole, with miles of track for railroads, kilowatt-hours for electric power, and barrels of oil for energy. Some treat their representations as hegemonic, even true. However, dealing with social and material variations, actors and analysts represent, build, maintain, and repair combinations of cultures, economies, governments, and materials. Thus, railroads and power systems, like other technologies and infrastructures, do not design, build, or repair themselves. To resolve problems, people with relevant skillsets interact in places to create common representations, actions, and objects tying themselves and others together in spaces.",

      "abstract": "How do humans ‘register’ God: attain knowledge or revelation of God? Analysis is familiar in terms of explanatory hypothesis, necessity, authority and commitment. However individuals speak also of ‘experience’ or ‘consciousness’ of God/Christ/grace – received widely, not just by an esoteric few. But may we properly hold that people can be cognitively aware of God? Undoubtedly such speech has problematic aspects. Not only do psychosis, self‐deception, gullibility recur. Commentators are liable to enlist what may be termed the A‐conceptual Lucidity picture, which critically fails. Various positions urged by thinkers rule out by definition the very possibility of cognitive awareness of God. Some analysts assert: a person’s experiencing x is constituted throughout by the person’s use of concepts in toto reached previously and independently. But, why adopt any a priori dismissiveness? We should favour a portrayal of people’s epistemic situation respecting God called the Consciousness Portrayal. Phrases therein include: ‘God’s gracious, guiding activity’; ‘a person’s access to God’; ‘attentive consciousness/conceptualization/knowledge of God’; ‘diverse levels or modes of consciousness’; ‘God’s guidance in a person’s creatively picking out concepts’; and ‘“cognition” which, as regards meaning , is not just a function of calculative reasoning’. Alertness to usage in non‐religious contexts aids our finding the religious phrasing intelligible. The Portrayal is approachable from an internal and external angle. Opponents’ challenges to the Portrayal invoke some broad epistemological theses, often pronounced intrinsic to ‘rationality’. But we fittingly espouse certain contrasting epistemological views. And these prove to fortify the Consciousness Portrayal.",

However, desire is the key connection to the agents' creator, and the ultimate source of behaviour. Desires are allowed to be incoherent, irrational, or at least a-rational. Agent environments establish a motivational context for agents to act upon. Agent societies are never truly autonomous. We argue that pre-designed utility-based behaviour search strategies not only hinder the adaptability of an agent but also prevent the emergence of novel social behaviour. In this paper, we propose a new model of desire acquisition and evolution. Agents continuously adapt their desires by means of both their intrinsic motivations, as well as a mimetic mechanism inspired in Rene' Girard's theory. Agents acquire new goals not through fitness or novelty but out of mechanisms such as envy, imitation and competition. To achieve their goals, agents have to sometimes discard them and just overcome their neighbours.",

For, as we have already heard in this Symposium, there is abundant evidence that, in the course of evolution, intention movements, displacement activities, etc., have been developed, modified or schematized to serve as social signals or 'releasers’ for appropriate behaviour in fellow members of the species. The meaning of ritualization is also clear in human life. Here ritual is an act often repeated, especially in a ceremonial way, which represents, stands for, or symbolizes some ideas, emotions or events. The ritual acts of religion are the ideal examples where every act of a complex rite symbolizes to the participant, some significant facet of doctrine or dogma. Through the ages the acts themselves have often become simplified and stereotyped, have been reduced to a minimum, so as to mime the original idea in the simplest possible manner, often with the utmost economy of gesture.",

      "abstract": "One problem associated with the identification of modest anthropomorphic figurines dedicated at Greek sanctuaries is their degree of specificity. Especially in the Archaic and early Classical periods, distinguishing representations of divinities, or even divinities and mortals, is difficult because their attributes are often non-specific, ambiguous or unidentifiable (at least by us), or because they lack identifying features altogether. This ambiguity and flexibility could have been intentional for both technical and ritual reasons. Manufacturers definitely benefited by producing figurines with broad iconography that could be used for different purposes and serve various cults. Clients also benefited: non-specific figurines of divinities or mortals could be dedicated at various sanctuaries, acquiring specificity and significance through cultic context and function. At the same time, workshops could also respond to clients’ demands or to new cultic needs by creating or adapting types. Generic figurines could be endowed with a more specific meaning by the dedicator: they could have been personalised through the oral prayer accompanying the dedication or by the construction of a personal narrative through the grouping of offerings. On the other hand, in some cases, the merging of divine and mortal features, assimilating the dedicator with the god, may have been intentional.",

      "title": "Stone Age Knife to Swiss Army Knife: An Invention Prototype",
      "abstract": "Abstract Every discipline needs a model system to study. That system should be both simple and complex: simple enough to understand and readily manipulate, and complex enough to embody important phenomena of interest. Genetics has Drosophila, or fruit flies (Morgan, 1926), and medical research has tissue cultures and mice. Cognitive psychology has candidate Drosophila in the form of various tasks devoted to problem-solving: the pendulum problem (Maier, 1931), the Tower of Hanoi problem, the cannibal/missionary problem, anagram problems, crypt-arithmetic problems (Newell &amp; Simon, 1972), and finally chess problems (Chase &amp; Simon, 1973). While all of these tasks are suitable for the study of various problem-solving facets, they do not readily lend themselves to the study of invention. Either they are not sufficiently open-ended or they do not deal with the physical world of device, process, and effect. In the context of invention, they fall short of either the simplicity or the complexity standard: they are not really simple enough to understand and manipulate, or they do not seem to embody the complex requirements of invention-something that is new, useful, and unobvious (U.S. Department of Commerce, 1985). A better candidate model system, a Drosophila of invention and creativity, is all about us. It is the simple hand tool as revealed in forms like needles, knives, forks, hammers, and shovels (Weber &amp; Dixon, 1989; Weber &amp; Perkins, 1989). The simplicity of the hand tool is obvious, but there is an underlying complexity also. Any given hand tool embodies function, structure, human interface and grip, actions, internal materials (what it is made of), and external materials (what it operates on). In microcosm the hand tool links our intentions to our actions via means; it must fit the mind, the hand, the world of action and effect, and the world of material, design, and construction. It is both simple and complex.",

Granted, the polarity of doing and undergoing, and the virtue of tranquillity, has played a major role in its history. And yet, what has been understood as unique to human life is primarily the capacity actively to explore and give shape to the conditions of its own life — a life that is reflectively directed rather than instinctively or affectively regulated. This has obscured the element of passivity which inheres in all our activity. Little thought is devoted to the state of being determined [Bestimmtsein] that lies at the heart of human determining [Bestimmendsein]. The unity of doing and letting-be-done is most often ignored where it — in theory as much as in praxis — is most important: namely, in dealing with the human capacity for self-determination.",

Satisfaction with life implies a contentment with or acceptance of life circumstances. An individual who is satisfied with his or her life may also feel a fulfillment of needs for his or her life as a whole. In essence, satisfaction is a subjective assessment of the quality of one's experience. Because it is inherently an evaluation, judgments of satisfaction could be subjective and involve a large cognitive component. Subjective and relative aspects of satisfaction may not directly correspond to objective conditions. For example, poor people may report higher life satisfaction than rich people – people with more income may not feel more satisfied than people with less income.",

The presentation of as voice also turns out to be only partial. The activity involved in is delay, which may sound like a passive act – something that happens to me against my will. I would like to be somewhere else, at another time, but something prevents me from doing so and therefore I am delayed. If is the forestalling of the will, something that is imposed upon the will, it is different from will, an other. The other that is revealed through is not conclusion but an experience, something that stops me from realizing my aim. On the other hand, by being delayed implies that in the end I might realize my aim and therefore there is nothing here that is totally enforced upon me. We are at once faced with a multi-layered system in which serves as an axis that is both active and passive, both will and the blocking of the will, both origin and what is not origin. As that which is both active and passive, seems to be something that cannot be described as two-dimensional.

Could there be consciousness without self-consciousness?Answer: Yes.We know this for a fact, because it can be empirically observed.Examples are numerous non-human animals, but also very young humans, severely mentally ill humans, and elderly humans with severe neurodegenerative disease.These can feel pain, fear, and fury to an intense degree, without having the capacity to reflect upon the self that is having these feelings.This does not lessen their suffering; it may even make it worse.2. Could there be self-consciousness without consciousness?Answer: No.This is a logical contradiction in terms.If I am conscious of my self, I am necessarily conscious of at least one thing -so I am conscious.Of course, you can have a self-referential loop that is not conscious -but ergo, in that scenario, they are also not self-*conscious*.And let's address some other assumptions in this text.A. The idea that the Turing test is a test of self-consciousness.It is not, nor was it ever intended to be.It is even becoming increasingly dubious whether the Turing text is a useful test of intelligence.A machine wins the Turing test if it manages to convince the human on the other side of the screen that they are talking to another human.But there",

      "title": "“(The) Play’s the Thing”: Shakespearean drama as an end in itself",
      "abstract": "Drama, more obviously than other genres of art, is a form of play; and play, according to Johan Huizinga, is essentially autotelic, or not a means to an end. Shakespeare’s plays are trivialised if they are seen essentially as means to other ends. Science conceives of the material world as an endless chain of causes, just as utilitarianism demands that all human artefacts and endeavours take their place on an eternal chain of purposes. This model devalues all its elements, for they acquire their worth only in terms of what appears next along the chain, never in or of themselves. The model is also counter-intuitive, since human experience values things, people and events differently from one another. Some items give us more pause than others; a few invite us to lose ourselves, as a child becomes lost in a game. Drama asks an audience to play along with its playing actors, pointlessly. If there is a point – moral or utilitarian – it is a mere side effect. A play, like Cleopatra’s hopping, is a digression from the straight journey of human lives toward death; and, as Freud suggests in Beyond the Pleasure Principle, detours are the only places in which the life drive makes any inroads into the death instincts’ relentless onward progress. Shakespeare’s dramatic works not only demonstrate play, and hook their audiences into the delightful, terrifying and all-absorbing world of (the) play, but they also provide a metanarrative about play, playing with the idea of playing. This essay resists the tendency to interpret Shakespeare’s dramatic works pragmatically, and instead shows, with examples from comedies and romances, especially The Tempest and A Midsummer Night’s Dream, and from tragedies including King Lear, Macbeth, Hamlet and Antony and Cleopatra, how they refuse to be means toward other ends, but “play till doomsday”, throwing reflective aspects up to their audiences and defying the puritans to stop them as they do so.",

Perinbanayagam presented various social theorists' conceptions of the Other in his book Signifying Acts: Structure and Meaning in Everyday Life. Basically, they comprise three Others: the Generalized Other, the Meiotic Other (my language), and the Significant Other. I will address three additional Others – the Unconscious Other, the Marginalized Other, and the Nonhuman Other – that I find in a broader and more recent literature. Although I group them into six main Others, the borders of these types are somewhat arbitrary, porous, and nondiscrete, as interaction and intersection exist among them. Two characteristics that distinguish one Other from another are whether the Other exists within or outside the Self and whether the Other is an individual or aggregate entity. The Unconscious Other and the Generalized Other both are constructed from symbolic material outside the individual but ultimately take up residence within the Self. The Meiotic Self is the self-divided; there may be multiple divisions but each Meiotic Self is usually presented as singly constituted. The Significant Other, an individual, and the Marginalized Other, often a status group or member of it, reside outside the Self but play supporting roles in relation to any particular Self, which may also be an individual or status group, such as men, Whites, and Americans. The Nonhuman Other may be individual, an aggregate of individuals, or the product of human behavior, all of which reside outside the Self.",

      "abstract": "In life, it often happens that humans take different actions on different occasions to save man or his wealth. These actions can be taken when there is a need to protect the integrity of man and his wealth, both individual and social wealth. Man performs these actions morally and without any institutional obligation. Man does the action without consent in order to save one's life or another's wealth. There is a need for such an action, because everyone sometimes in certain cases needs mutual help. With these behaviors of people, it is seen that they do not take these actions out of legal obligation, but act and should act with the consciousness and conscience of the civilized man. People who do this are driven by the need for cooperation, humanity, existence at the expense of the other, namely society. A person performs this action by perpetrating the work of another without consent for any other person. Hence, they undertake some factual and legal action for the other, sacrificing something that can be the property value and their bodily integrity. Sometimes this action must be taken because there are actions that cannot be postponed, therefore someone should take an action in such situations even when uninvited. Consequently, the subject matter analyzed in this paper is the act of perpetration of the work of another without consent as a source of the right of obligations in the Republic of Kosovo.&#x0D; &#x0D; Received: 6 October 2021 / Accepted: 1 November 2021 / Published: 5 November 2021",

      "abstract": "Extract The Inclusiveness of Ethics The title of this book, Inclusive Ethics, is meant to designate an ethics that develops and defends a morality that regulates actions affecting anything which has or could have consciousness.1 Such a morality is inclusive compared to most existing moralities. It is a plausible hypothesis that morality originated as something quite exclusive: in order to promote unity and cohesion within human groups, so as to make them more successful in struggles with other human groups, and natural adversaries and adversities. Thus, morality was restricted to in-groups and excluded various kinds of outsiders. It promoted unity and cohesion within in-groups by generally prohibiting harmful acts against their members, and by encouraging cooperation between them, but it did not prohibit harming members of other groups, or encourage cooperation with them. The morality expounded in this book is also more inclusive than a more wide-ranging morality according to which all that has consciousness or will have consciousness independently of what is done matters in itself at the time of action, since it takes possible conscious beings or individuals, who could—but perhaps will not—be made to exist with consciousness, to matter morally in themselves. Entities which do not carry with them this possibility of consciousness—whether they be organic and biologically alive, or inorganic and non-living—cannot morally matter in themselves, though they can morally matter extrinsically because of their relations to individuals who do matter morally in themselves. Thus, having intrinsic moral importance or significance is anchored in the possibility or actuality of consciousness, according to the morality here advanced. This is because entities with these relations to consciousness are the only entities for which things can be intrinsically good or bad at some point.",

      "title": "Is Infant Learning Egocentric or Duocentric? Was Piaget Wrong?",
      "abstract": "It may be that a major North American understanding of how children develop, which owes much to studies and conclusions of Jean Piaget, is incorrect. It may be that educational practices based on this understanding are in difficulty because they do not match what children need and seek naturally. Consider further these two possibilities by first examining how Piaget viewed beginnings of development. In his summative work, Psychology of Child (1969), it is emphasized that child's development, both cognitive and affective, begins with newborn baby totally centred in itself: . . . child's initial universe is entirely centered on his own body and action in egocentrism as total as it is unconscious (for lack of consciousness of self). In course of first eighteen months, however, there occurs a kind of Copernican revolution, or more simply, a kind of general decentering process whereby eventually comes to regard himself as object among others . . . (Piaget and Inhelder, 1969, p. 13). Further, We have assumed that affective decentering is a correlative of cognitive decentering, not because one dominates other, but because both occur as a result of a single integrated process. Indeed, when little ceases to relate everything to his states and to his own action, and begins to substitute for a world of fluctuating tableaux without spatio-temporal consistency or external physical causality a universe of permanent objects structured according to its own groups of spatio-temporal displacements and according to objectified and spatialized causality, then his affectivity will also be attached to these localizable, permanent objects and sources of external causality which persons come to be (p. 26). A Copernican revolution is not usually glossed over lightly but for Piaget this decentering process merely manifests the existence of a law of development which is of some importance, because it will also govern all later development of child (p. 19). This development he saw proceeding through assimilation by which every newly established connection is integrated into what is already present and operative: The organizing activity of subject must be considered just as important as connections inherent in external stimuli; for subject becomes aware of these connections only to degree that he can assimilate them by means of his existing (p. 5). But this raises question how a whose existing structures are from beginning totally egocentric could proceed to assimilate decentering. There is a puzzling gap here for which Piaget provided no bridge. He contrasted his view of development through assimilation with understanding of other students for whom key mechanism in development is association, a cumulative process by which conditionings are added to reflexes and many other acquisitions to conditionings, each a response to external stimulus (cf. pp. 5-6). He might have pointed to Scottish philosopher, John Macmurray, as one taking associationist approach to early development. There is a gap also in Macmurray's explanation. He saw newborn developing from total helplessness without instincts and without coordinated movement: The movements of limb and trunk and head of which he is capable do not even suggest unconscious purposiveness . . . All purposive human behaviour has to be learned. To begin with, our responses to stimulus are, without exception, biologically random (Macmurray, 1961, pp. 47-48. Yet Macmurray would explain somehow that this unpurposive newborn is taught entirely by its caretaker (its mother) to move from total randomness into interdependent mutuality. His explanation necessitated his positing an impulse to communicate with another human being in spite of his prior rejection of any purposive human behaviour in newborn: In human infant-and this is heart of matter-the impulse to communicate is his sole adaptation to world into which he is born. …",

      "abstract": "There are, or very much appear to be, a number of things in the universe with the following characteristics: they are private to any person who is aware of them in a certain way; they seem very possibly to exist only if someone is aware of them in a certain way; they are not literally constituents of states of consciousness; they are not composed of atoms and molecules but may have some physical characteristics such as shape, spatial location, and color; and they are commonly referred to as something mental. Anything that more or less satisfies these conditions I call a secondary mental entity. Secondary mental entities fall into three moderately distinct subcategories. They are (i) sensations proper such as pains, tickles, and itches; (2) emotions proper such as anger, fear, and exhilaration; and (3) perceptionrelated entities such as sense data, images, and afterimages. Those of the third category are obviously more theory-dependent notions than those of the other two; and my calling the members of all three categories entities should be taken initially as only a convenient way of speaking and not as an endorsement or denial of any particular theory as to their nature or existence. In the empiricist tradition in the philosophy of mind, secondary mental entities have usually been taken to be the very essence, or at least paradigmatic, of the realm of the mental while states of consciousness have been largely ignored. (Or, perhaps it would be more nearly accurate to say that many have supposed that states of consciousness can be exhaustively analyzed by secondary mental entities.) For this lamentable state of affairs there are very good historical and very poor philosophical reasons; or so at least I have argued in detail elsewhere.' But for good or ill, it is easy to understand how taking mind to consist only, or paradigmatically, of sec-",

For example, if one were a non-swimmer, to seek to rescue a child drowning in deep, shark-infested waters at great personal risk would be to do a virtuous act but not to perform a moral duty, and philosophers generally hold that it would not be wrong not to attempt the rescue. On the other hand, to fail to rescue a child (at no personal risk to oneself) who was drowning in shallow water is probably not to perform a moral duty. What matters are the circumstances of each case – in this particular example, the circumstances concern the risk to the rescuer and whether the rescuer was likely to do the act successfully.",

The self is not a phenomenon and is thus not accessible to the same kinds of scientific inquiry and measurement as are natural psychological constructs that are observable (e.g., human motor behavior). Self-esteem is nonsensical-cannot be measured through sensory data collection-and hence imaginary (Berlow, personal communication); as a result, an individual's self-esteem must be inferred, either by an individual's report of his/her sense of self (experienced self) or by reporting the individual's self-esteem (presented self). But the social science community has too readily accepted an individual's personal self-report of self-esteem as natural fact. The guiding, and unquestioned assumption has been that the individual alone has access to the self. Who are we as outsiders to question this source of data? Few self-esteem researchers have used others to infer self-esteem-and thus they have relatively little knowledge of the validity of their self-report data (Wells & Marwell, 1976).",

No one calls in question the fact that the theological virtues are preeminent and people certainly do not dream of denying that they have a part to play in the spiritual life. It is doubtful, however, whether they are cultivated with the care they deserve and whether they are actually directed towards their object. Let us consider this direction which it is important they should take in practice. Among the different virtues, faith bears a strongly marked objective character. Its purpose is to attach the mind to the truths God has revealed. These truths in no sense derive from us and are certainly not the fruit of our meditations. God has revealed them and they have entered into us through the medium of hearing.",

They have been dened as those activities in which individuals experience leisure dierently, due to their being taken to the limit of their resources. These activities can range from 'abnormal' leisure, such as unprotected anal intercourse, to extreme sports. They have been seen as allowing the individual to experience transcendence beyond the mundane and everyday, with a suggestion that such pursuits aord a particular glimpse into the human condition (see Blackshaw, 2009). For those of us seeking new directions in this area of Leisure Studies, extreme sports are a rich resource. The focus in this chapter, therefore, is on extreme sporting activities, on which, since the 1980s, there has been theoretical and empirical work on the more established alternative sports such as skateboarding, rock climbing and surng, whilst activities such as windsurng, snowboarding, BMX biking, extreme ironing, extreme skiing, ultimate Frisbee, kitesurng, in-line skating, parkour, whitewater kayaking and adventure racing have also been dened as alternative sports as the category has both expanded and diversied.",

Without constitutive resistance, we are not able to know how to separate ourselves from the mother, and we do not know how to construct our autonomy in relation to the others. The state of ignorance due to language is violent and this has implications in the workplace as well. However, the ignorance is in a stronger collision there, because language in the workplace cannot be mere discourse. At work, people seek results and material and intellectual transformations.

      "title": "Simone Weil: A Sense of God",
      "abstract": "Simone Weil:A Sense of God J. Ranilo B. Hermida (bio) There is a reality outside of the world, that is to say, outside space and time, outside man's mental universe, outside any sphere of whatsoever that is accessible to human faculties. Corresponding to this reality, at the center of the human heart, is the longing for an absolute good, a longing which is always there and is never appeased by any object in this world. Simone Weil, 1909–43 Prologue There is one thread of thought no serious reader of Simone Weil can possibly miss from the variegated tapestry of her thinking. And that is her sense of God, which is almost naturally embedded therein. She unfailingly elevates her every insight to a level that is at once metaphysical or theological. Indeed, Weil considers all human concerns always \"situated in the context of our relation to God.\"1 She excludes nothing for she believes that even those practices not readily recognized as religious contribute to our spiritual development and prepare us for loving God.2 [End Page 127] Therefore, it may strike us as baffling that Weil, who is likened to some of the greatest of the early Fathers of the Church,3 makes this confession in her spiritual biography: I may say that never at any moment in my life have I \"sought for God.\" For this reason, which is probably too subjective, I do not like this expression and it strikes me as false. As soon as I reached adolescence, I saw the problem of God as a problem the data of which could not be obtained here below, and I decided that the only way of being sure not to reach a wrong solution, which seemed to me the greatest possible evil, was to leave it alone. So I left it alone. I neither affirmed nor denied anything. It seemed to me useless to solve the problem, for I thought that, being in this world, our business was to adopt the best attitude with regard to the problems of this world, and that such an attitude did not depend upon the solution of the problem of God.4 To anyone who has a studied familiarity with Weil, however, this paradox is immediately recognizable as a distinctive character of her work, thought, and her very life. Her penchant for integrating apparently contradictory elements constitutes her unique approach. As Christopher Frost and Rebecca Bell-Metereau point out, While the mainstream of Western thought may be concerned with consistency, in considerable contrast Simone Weil, long before postmodernist and deconstructionist ideas became current, was concerned with recognizing the absence of consistency in life, the continual presence of reversals and contradictions, and the unavoidable existence of these even within \"solutions\" to problems of the human condition.5 That is not to say of course that all we encounter in the works of Weil are diverse and heterogeneous ideas. While, admittedly, Weil expressed herself in short essays, in thoughts randomly jotted in [End Page 128] notebooks, and in reflections recorded in personal journals, there is, nonetheless, a clearly identifiable coherence that unites her positions on a range of subjects close to her heart. The purpose of this article is to focus on one of Weil's most defining viewpoints—namely, her sense of God—by drawing from some of her writings two main leitmotifs (discussed below under the headings \"Decreation\" and \"Malheur\"). How central to her thinking this is may be inferred from her unwavering conviction that reality is only transcendent. Weil therefore contends that a true reading of reality can only be done from the perspective of the divine. In what may be considered another irony of her colorful life, Weil did not come upon her sense of God by way of her family influence. It could not have been so, for, as a matter of fact, she was born into and grew up in an agnostic Jewish family. Weil herself professed no religion and did not practice any. Neither did she discover this sense of God from her readings of mystical works for which she claimed she never felt an attraction. As she wrote, \"I had never read any...",

      "abstract": "Movement of the body is an essential way to characterise autism, according to diagnostic criteria. However, qualifying descriptions of what autistic movements are, their functions and personal value, are missing from academic literature and clinical guidance. We systematically searched for autistic adults’ descriptions of their body and its movement within autobiographical narratives in blog data. Descriptions from 23 autistic authors formed a qualitative data set. The search strategy identified descriptions of movements and meanings without a priori definitions, such as being stereotyped or ritualistic, which were submitted to a thematic analysis. Authors described stigmatisation of some of their movements, causing censorship. However, movement provided personal benefits, including enhanced thinking and focus, routine, sensory regulation, release of energy, increased body connection and awareness, regulated emotion, and time without self-restraint. Examples included stimming or self-stimulating behaviour, dancing, and physical exercise. Movement was accompanied by qualifying descriptions of being natural and harmless. Moving freely, expressively, and sometimes repetitively, strengthened self-identity. In conclusion, body movements have both stigmatised and non-stigmatised appearances for autistic adults, but these cannot be distinguished by the function of the movement. Expressive, regulating and repetitive movements can be a well-being resource for autistic people. Implications for practice are discussed. Lay abstract What is already known? Moving the body in ‘stereotyped’, ‘repetitive’, ‘ritualised’ or ‘unusual’ ways is part of the criteria for receiving a diagnosis of autism. However, the reasons for these movements and their personal value are not well understood. Certain ways of moving have become part of a disorder, and have received negative judgements, whereas other movements have not. What this paper adds? We searched online blogs for descriptions of movement written by autistic adults, using their preferred language and definitions. The blog authors said that many types of movement attracted negative judgement, including mis-coordination shown during sports, dancing in unusual places or moving repetitively, such as when stimming. However, movement provided personal benefits, and could enhance thinking and focus, provide meaningful routine, contribute to sensory regulation, release energy, increase body awareness, emotion regulation and strengthen self-identity. Implications for practice and policy Movement could be a well-being resource, used to reduce distraction, overwhelm, confusion and distress for autistic people. This should be considered within personal coping strategies and psychological therapies. The examples provided in this study could inform autism assessments, to ensure that the meanings of movements are considered alongside the appearances of movement. Some movements such as stimming have the same functions as many other ways of moving, including dancing and exercising, which could help to reduce stigma around being autistic if reflected in policy and practice. Improving understanding is important for informing how autism is assessed, and how personal experiences of being autistic are heard.",

      "abstract": "What is the good for human persons? If I am trying to lead the best possible life I could lead, not the morally best life, but the life that is best for me, what exactly am I seeking? This phrasing of the question I will be pursuing may sound tendentious, so some explanation is needed. What is good for one person, we ordinarily suppose, can conflict with what is good for other persons and with what is required by morality. A prudent person seeks her own good efficiently; she selects the best available means to her good. If we call the value that a person seeks when she is being prudent “prudential value,” then an alternative rendering of the question to be addressed in this essay is “What is prudential value?” We can also say that an individual flourishes or has a life high in well-being when her life is high in prudential value. Of course, these common-sense appearances that the good for an individual, the good for other persons, and the requirements of morality often are in conflict might be deceiving. For all that I have said here, the correct theory of individual good might yield the result that sacrificing oneself for the sake of other people or for the sake of a morally worthy cause can never occur, because helping others and being moral always maximize one's own good. But this would be the surprising result of a theory, not something we should presuppose at the start of inquiry. When a friend has a baby and I express a conventional wish that the child have a good life, I mean a life that is good for the child, not a life that merely helps others or merely respects the constraints of morality. After all, a life that is altruistic and perfectly moral, we suppose, could be a life that is pure hell for the person who lives it—a succession of horrible headaches marked by no achievements or attainments of anything worthwhile and ending in agonizing death at a young age. So the question remains, what constitutes a life that is good for the person who is living it?",

      "abstract": "<h3>To the Editor:—</h3> The controversy between the clinician Sagebiel and the psychologist Cattell concerning the definition of anxiety (LETTERS,<i>JAMA</i><b>190</b>:859 [Nov 30] 1964) is of epistemological rather than semantic interest. It demonstrates the epistemological inferiority, even uselessness, of the psychologists' approach. Anxiety and fear belong to so-called general feelings (<i>Gemeingefühle</i>). Fear is an atavistic emotional heritage serving protective purposes against a threatening event, impending danger, or risky performance. This psychological emotion is a cortical function with repercussion on the diencephalic autonomic nervous system. Alteration of respiration, pulse rate, or blood pressure; blushing or pallor; inhibition of salivary secretion; or weeping are witness thereof. Anxiety is fear without extrinsic cause, without a substratum, not fear of something. It is an autonomous feeling aroused by intrinsic cortical processes, conscious or subconscious memories and associations originating from past experiences and life situations. It is a pathological outlet of mental processes involved",

Intelligent assets could include raw materials, components or products, as well as transit equipment (e.g., pallets, packages) and transportation systems (e.g., conveyers, trucks and cars). By delegating control to assets, we enable autonomous behaviour, i.e., decision-making without external or central control. Through cooperation with the environment and other assets, the system may be able to organise itself. That is, without external or central control or maybe even without a reference to the global objectives of the system. In other words, a self-organizing system consists of autonomous assets, each with their own goal. Through mutual cooperation they are able to achieve a common goal. In this thesis, we view self-organizing logistics as a way to cope with the complex, dynamic and stochastic nature of the logistics sector and the abovementioned challenges.",

The search for a true picture of how the world is falls into the latter category. This goal cannot be analysed in terms of the satisfaction of our survival needs, which may well be better served by somewhat distorted conceptions of how things are. It nevertheless arises logically from our conception of ourselves as self‐conscious believers operating in a world not necessarily consistent with our needs or cognitive structures. I say something about the limitations of Darwinian accounts of self‐consciousness and truth‐seeking in human beings’.",

      "title": "Sāṅkhya",
      "abstract": "Considered one of the oldest classical Hindu schools by Indian tradition, Sāṅkhya is most famous in Indian philosophy for its atheism, its dualist model of puruṣa (passive, individual consciousness) and prakṛti (nonconscious, cognitive-sentient body) and its theory that effects pre-exist in their cause. In its classical formulation the puruṣa-prakṛti model is analysed into twenty-five components (tattva) intended to encompass entire metaphysical, cognitive, psychological, ethical and physical worlds in terms of their embodiment as individual constituents and the creative and interpretive projection of those worlds as experience by and for individuals. Both the world and the individual, in other words, are considered a phenomenological refraction and projection of the underlying and constitutive components of the conscious body. Falsely identifying with the cognitive and sensory components of prakṛti (which according to orthodox Sāṅkhya performs cognitive and sentient operations, but is bereft of consciousness; puruṣa alone is conscious), Sāṅkhyans believe themselves to be the agents of their actions, rather than recognizing that actions are processes lacking any selfhood. Sāṅkhyans claim that liberation from the suffering of repeated rebirths can only be achieved through a profound understanding of the distinction between puruṣa and prakṛti. The latter is not abandoned after liberation, but continues to operate, observed with detachment by puruṣa. However, according to some versions of Sāṅkhya, prakṛti eventually becomes dormant. Puru ṣa and prakṛti both are considered to be eternal and to have no beginning. Since liberation is achieved through knowledge, Sāṅkhya stresses the importance and efficacy of knowledge over ritual and other religious endeavours. Sāṅkhya is cognate to saṅkhyā, meaning ‘to count’ or ‘enumerate’. Thus Sāṅkhya seeks to enumerate the basic facts of reality so that people will understand them and find liberation. Basic Sāṅkhyan models and terms appear in some Upaniṣads and underlie important portions of the epic Mahābhārata, especially the Bhagavad Gītā and Mokṣadharma. No distinct Sāṅkhyan text prior to Īśvarakṛṣṇa’s Sāṅkhyakārikā (c.350–c.450) is extant. It enumerates and explains the twenty-five components and a subsidiary list of sixty topics (ṣaṣtitantra), which are then subdivided into further enumerative lists. Most of the subsequent Sāṅkhyan literature consists of commentaries and expositions of the Sāṃkhyakārikā and its ideas, which continued to be refined without major alterations well into the eighteenth century. Sāṅkhyan models strongly influenced numerous other Indian schools, including Yoga, Vedānta, Kashmir Shaivism and Buddhism.",

The sociological approach focuses on persons who seeks to connect with Allah, and asks about why they want to connect. They are mostly urban men of culture, education, and wealth enjoying public acclaim during, and also after, their lifetime. The second conclusion turns to the process, the search itself and asks if it is an existential process. It focuses on what is linked to Allah, and asks about the nature of the links. Its advocates dwell in the mystery of the Name. Allah exceeds the Name, even as the Name itself becomes a focus of attention on Allah as an immeasurable force, the source of life and death, good and evil, hope and despair. Yet neither the sociological assessment nor the existential response will satisfy the skeptic. The skeptic may be a believer or unbeliever, but they never cease to ask: where is Allah, and when does the quest end? They assert that Allah, or God, may not exist or may exist, but only as Being—infinite, timeless, and unknowable.",

      "abstract": "The judiciary is not a charity house. But it can’t be a lottery house either. When dealing with an applied social science (which is not – and cannot be - cartesian) the human factor will inevitably make a difference in the equation because people perceive the same situation differently, according to their own filters. The law, doctrine and jurisprudence could offer limits to this cognitive process, but end up being used (manipulated) later, just to justify what the subject-judge already wanted to do, simply deciding according to his own conscience. The ideal of justice is so discredited that the most modern courses revolve around persuasion (rhetoric) in court precisely because “in every head, a different sentence”. That increase the adherents to the empire of the law. But as history has taught, extremes are dangerous. On the one hand, narcissistic judges, who simply do what they want, when they want. On the other hand, judges who do not print theiridentity in the decision, using only the law, the process in its rawness, forgetting the human factor. The judge can understand what cannot be written: emotions. But he is also a human being, so it is important that he perceives his own to remain in the place of external third party in the concrete realization of law. The intention, therefore, is to reverse the procedure so that it is heeded to legislative changes and contemporary jurisprudence, which should be followed by hierarchy, rather than anchoring itself in “diary-sentences” or “parchment-sentences”.Therefore, practical rationality, by encouraging the judge to fit the law (previously studied) to the concrete case (analyzed later) inspires (self)control (emotionally) and allows adequate fundamentation. It is possible and urgent because people under jurisdiction deserves some legal certainty.",

The provoking behavior was generally portrayed by the perpetrator as meaningful and comprehensible, whereas the victim tended to depict it as arbitrary, gratuitous, or incomprehensible. Victim accounts portrayed the incident in a long-term context that carried lasting implications, especially of continuing harm, loss, and grievance. Perpetrator accounts tended to cast the incident as a closed, isolated incident that did not have lasting implications. Several findings fit a hypothesis that interpersonal conflicts may arise when a victim initially stifles anger and then finally responds to an accumulated series of provocations, whereas the perpetrator perceives only the single incident and regards the angry response as an unjustified overreaction. Victim and perpetrator roles are associated with different subjective interpretations.",

      "abstract": "There are ongoing philosophical, moral, and societal debates about experiments on live animals. Along with a consequentialist approach, it may be considered that an action – here an experiment on live animals – is morally acceptable if the knowledge it aims to produce can result in an overall benefit. In other words, it is acceptable if the constraints imposed on the animals involved are outweighed by the larger benefits expected for others (humans or animals). Alternatively, it can be argued that, because animals are sentient beings, they have a right not to be used by others. There may also be points of view in between, considering that animal experimentation is acceptable on the condition that no alternative ways to gain the relevant knowledge are possible and animal suffering is limited as much as possible. What is considered as an important knowledge that justifies experimentation may differ as it refers to individual values. It is not the intention of this chapter to hold a moral debate about animal experimentation (for reviews, see for instance [1], [2]). Rather, we take a pragmatic approach that we hope will guide experimenters in their decision to undertake an experiment (or not), after having made explicit all arguments for or against that experiment.",

The idea that ‘I’, ‘you’, and ‘we’ are interdependent concepts, and that joint thought and joint projects are central to our lives, is prominent in recent philosophy of mind and action. But the idea is important in ethics as well. Whether my individual life goes well or ill is constitutively intertwined with whether our joint life goes well or ill. If there are facts about the former (which few deny) then there are facts about the latter. So if you and I differ about what we should aim for, what is at stake in the debate is our shared future welfare. The familiar idea of ‘a fact–value distinction’, implying that there is no fact-directed reflection which could help us, presupposes a faulty individualistic account of welfare.

Se define aquí un continuo de preparación (\"preparedness\") y se sostiene que los organismos están preparados para asociar ciertos eventos, impreparados para algunos otros y contrapreparados para otros. Una revisión de los daros de los paradigmas tradicionales del aprendizaje muestra que es falso el supuesto de la equivalente asociabilidad. En el condicionamiento clásico las ratas están preparadas para asociar sabores con enfermedad incluso tras muy largos retrasos del refuerzo, pero contrapreparadas para asociar sabores y descarga eléctrica. En el entrenamiento instrumental, las palomas aprenden a picotear una tecla en ausencia de contingencia entre el picoteo y el grano (están preparadas), mientras que los gatos, por el contrario, tienen dificultad en aprender a lamerse a ellos mismos para escapar y los perros no bostezan por obtener comida (están contrapreparados). En la discriminación, los perros están contrapreparados para aprender que diferentes ubicaciones de estímulos discriminativos controlan la respuesta «ir/ no ir» y a aprender que diferentes cualidades controlan la respuesta de dirección. En la evitación, las respuestas del repertorio defensivo natural están preparadas para evitar la descarga eléctrica, mientras que las del repertorio apetitivo están contrapreparadas. La adquisición del lenguaje y la autonomía funcional de los motivos se consideran también formando parte del continuo de preparación. Por último, se especula que las leyes mismas del aprendizaje pueden variar con la preparación del organismo para las asociaciones y que diferentes mecanismos fisiológicos y cognitivos pueden covariar con esa dimensión.",

      "abstract": "To a great degree, Levinas's philosophical commitment to the primacy of ethics is a response to intellectual and historical challenges to morality in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Viewed in this way, Levinas's thought is a contribution to moral philosophy. Examining it, one can ask what he says about the grounds of moral obligation and value, the nature of morality, its normative content, and such. But we have seen that to read Levinas in this way is too narrow. It is more appropriate to take his philosophy as a contribution to understanding human existence in the broadest sense. It is, in this way, a philosophical anthropology or a philosophy of human existence, and Levinas's central teaching is that ethical matters are fundamental or central to human existence. He is not, of course, the first person to make this claim, but the way in which he argues for this position is distinctive. He claims that as human beings we are social beings, that is, that we have direct, first-person/second-person, face-to-face relationships with others, and that as social beings our relationships have an ethical character that is the most determinative feature of our existence with others in the world. This is at least part of what he means by the claim that “ethics is first philosophy.”",

For there exists a great chasm between those, on one side, who relate everything to a single central vision, one system, less or more coherent, or articulate, in terms of which they understand, think and feel—a single, universal, organising principle in terms of which alone all that they are and say has significance—and, on the other side, those who pursue many ends, often unrelated and even contradictory, connected, if at all, only in some de facto way, for some psychological or physiological cause, related by no moral or aesthetic principle. These last lead lives, perform acts and entertain ideas that are centrifugal rather than centripetal; their thought is scattered or diffused, moving on many levels, seizing upon the essence of a vast variety of experiences and object for what they are in themselves, without, consciously or unconsciously, seeking to fit them into, or exclude them from, any one unchanging, all-embracing, sometimes self-contradictory and incomplete, at times fanatical, unitary inner vision. The first kind of intellectual and artistic personality belongs to the hedgehogs, the second to the foxes...we may, without too much fear of contradiction, say that, in this sense, Dante belongs to the first category, Shakespeare to the second; Plato, Lucretius, Pascal, Hegel, Dostoevsky, Nietzsche, Ibsen, Proust, are, in varying degrees hedgehogs; Herodotus, Aristotle, Montaigne, Erasmus, Moliere, Goethe, Pushkin, Balzac, Joyce are foxes.1",

      "abstract": "Pictures of handled objects such as a beer mug or frying pan are shown to prime speeded reach and grasp actions that are compatible with the object. To determine whether the evocation of motor affordances implied by this result is driven merely by the physical orientation of the object's handle as opposed to higher-level properties of the object, including its function, prime objects were presented either in an upright orientation or rotated 90° from upright. Rotated objects successfully primed hand actions that fit the object's new orientation (e.g., a frying pan rotated 90° so that its handle pointed downward primed a vertically oriented power grasp), but only when the required grasp was commensurate with the object's proper function. This constraint suggests that rotated objects evoke motor representations only when they afford the potential to be readily positioned for functional action.",

      "title": "On the Sanctity of Nature",
      "abstract": "Concerns about sacred--common in everyday moral thinking--have crept into bioethics in various forms. Further, given a certain view of metaphysics of morals that is now widely endorsed in Western philosophy, there is in principle no reason that judgments about sacred cannot be part of careful and reasoned moral deliberation. In philosophically trained circles, it is a bit gauche to describe something as To speak seriously of sanctity of life; of humans, nature, or natural order as being sacred or of why we ought not to play God, is to risk appearing muddleheaded and conservative. Also, one will likely be viewed as doing uniquely religious ethics, and so as offering only a sidelight that must somehow be translated into another language if it is to have any general impact. The risk is perhaps even worse in bioethics, which at least until recently has favored moral requirements whose enforcement is as straightforward and uncontestable as possible. To respect a person's wishes, maximize happiness, or ensure kind of equality among people, we can often look to what a person has actually said about his or her wishes, what people are in general known to like, what goods others have, and so on. Of course we still run into various troubles, but we have an easier time of it than we would if we were arguing about how to respect autonomy in way Kant had in mind. And we fare much better than we would if we were maundering on about sacred. The usual philosophical attitude to sacred comes out nicely in President's Commission's patient but ultimately dismissive analysis of belief that genetic engineering might amount to playing God. In 1982 report Splicing Life, commission asked what objection really means, identified a handful of interpretations, and easily dispensed with each. If objection is simply to interfering with nature, for example, we are quickly caught in a dilemma. In one sense, all human activity interferes with nature, indeed medicine is nothing but organized interference in nature. In another sense, though, no human activity can interfere with nature; medicine adheres to laws of physics, after all. Plainly, then, objection must seek to make distinctions among interventions--some are laudable, worrisome. The commission considered making a distinction by appealing to God's plan or purposes as revealed in nature, but found appeal too raw: some reason must be given for this judgment.[1] Finding no reason at hand, commission set objection aside. Years later commission's executive director, Alexander M. Capron, wrote that one of work's signal achievements was its ability to debunk playing God objection: By carefully dissecting complaint that gene therapy amounted to `playing God,' report was able to differentiate important concerns about means and consequences from rhetorical claims.[2] The idea that genetic engineering threatens sacred still resonates in less philosophically astute crowds, however. When President Clinton asked National Bioethics Advisory Commission to comment on creation of a part-cow, part-human embryo, he wrote that he was deeply troubled by development, not that he was worried somebody might get hurt. There was a lurking anxiety about very idea of chimerical embryos. Thus he asked commission to consider the implications of such research, not just its possible consequences, although he went on to note implicitly that truly wonderful consequences might legitimately encourage us to create and study cow-human embryos anyway. Worries about how humans relate to their world are also involved in Jeremy Rifkin's broad assault on biotechnology. Rifkin's explicit objections underline possible horrific outcomes, but his description of biotechnology as algeny, as an effort to change essence of living things analogous to alchemists' attempt to change essence of physical things, needs no mention of consequences to work as an objection. …",

Adanya perbedaan antara malam dan siang melahirkan dimensi waktu; malaikat dan setan serta surga dan neraka melahirkan dimensi nilai dan moral; bumi dan langit serat barat- timur dan utara - selatan melahirkan dimensi ruang dan tempat. Perbedaan, pertentangan dan konflik merupakan suatu kewajaran dalam dinamika kehidupan manusia. Dengan demikian merupakan suatu kewajaran, bahwa pertentangan atau konflik akan selalu ada selama manusia itu ada, baik secara individu maupun anggota kelompok ataupun masyarakat. Dalam kehidupan berorganisasi misalnya, konflik antara pemimpin dengan orang yang dipimpinnya atau antar anggota kelompok dengan anggota lainnya bisa saja terjadi. Sebab didalam suatu organisasi terdapat beberapa individu yang berbeda kepribadiannya, kepentingannya, latar belakang, sosial, budaya, agama, dan sebagainya. Konflik tidak bisa dihindari, tetapi dapat dikelola, bahkan disinergikan menjadi sesuatu yang sangat dinamis. Oleh karena itu, pengendalian konflik merupakan salah satu tugas pemimpin dalam kepemimpinannya. Efektifitas kepemimpinan sesorang dapat dinilai dan bagaimana ia mampu mengendalikan dan mengelola konflik. Kegagalan seorang pemimpin dalam mengenddalikan dan mengelola konflik akan menimbulkan sesuatu yang anti produktif dan destruktif, sebaliknya jika seorang pemimpin dapat mengendalikan dan mengelola konflik secara baik. Konflik merupakan masalah yang pelik untuk segera dicarikan pemecahannya. Konflik dapat bermanfaat terutama dalam : (l) Menciptakan kreativitas (2) Perubahan sosial yang konstruktif (3) Membangun keterpaduan kelompok, dan (4) Peningkatan fungsi kekeluargaan/ kebersamaan.

It records only the most frequent phenomena, being incapable of naming what is unique or particular. The conscious or unconscious distortion of a message places the recipient in an emotional state of uncertainty that may go from sadness to deep anxiety. The deliberate elusion of the psychopathological terminology - having the explicit role of distracting the patient’s attention from his/her personal troubles, breaking thus the contemplation of one’s own suffering - is not an universally accepted technique; the strategic therapy, for example, focuses exclusively on the symptomatic behaviour that needs to be changed, keeping, however, the linguistic expression of the suffering in the terms suggested by the patients: not only is the exacerbated verbalization of his/her suffering accepted by the therapist, but it is also reformulated, encouraged, and prescribed, the method being attributed to Avicenna, the famous doctor of the Antiquity. From a therapeutic perspective, ignoring the linguistic expression of a symptom the consequences of which are unpredictable, is thought to be inefficient: once accepted, it has to be integrated in a new interpersonal system, the change of the context engendering the change of the message unconsciously spread by the patient: isolation, as primordial pathogenous source and, implicitly, the refuse of the intersubjective communication, have a high self-destructuring potential.",

Moreover, in Alarcón’s plays, prudent deception is invariably concerned with the maintenance of honour-virtue, and the discovery of moral truths, whilst cunning is employed in the pursuit of worldly or sensual goals such as social advancement, riches, and sexual gratification. A circumspect and reasoned approach often proves sufficient to expose the deceptions practised by others, but Alarcón’s protagonists must also learn to overcome the inducement to self-deception presented by the allure of worldly attributes such as beauty, wealth and position, and to regard these as irrelevant or illusory, and this kind of desengaño requires a higher degree of wisdom.",

To be significant in the relevant sense is not only to be of value but specifically to be rare and of particularly high value. Having this rare, high value can be determined in two ways: either in a contextualized manner that determines importance relative to a particular standard of evaluation and a limited range of contrast classes or in a parameter-free “cosmic” manner. Regardless of the manner of scope, there seem to be multiple ways of achieving such importance: by having a big impact on others or on oneself or simply by being of value regardless of impact. But being important does not require that the important person and their value must have been irreplaceable. It just requires that the person actually be valuable.",

      "abstract": "The basic way of argument of Confucianism and Taoism in the Pre-Chin Dynasty can be generalized as facing death,which means that when confronting unknowable and non-reasonable gods,spirits of the dead and some other supernatural beings,the Chinese usually apply practical reason to settle down themselves upon real life,using the thorough tragic consciousness as life motives to establish their unique transcendental philosophy.while you don't know about life,how can you know about death,which means that life questions about gods and death can be solved in real life practice,thereby cutting off the relations between gods,death and the establishment of human life value.I would not regret dying in the evening provided I would have gained Tao in the morning,which means that individual's value in his whole life should aim for learning Tao so one can live beyond death.Neither complaining to fate,nor blaming others means that one should be self-contained and seeking for one's own unstrained spiritual freedom by promoting internal moral cultivation instead of effected by external factors.Without recognizing the decree of fate,it is impossible to be a superior means that the final purpose of human life is meant to be fully implemented upon the mandate of heaven which is both realistic and transcendent.The perfect man ignores self;the divine man ignores achievement;the true Sage ignores reputation means pursuing aesthetic and free mind in the limited ordinary life.All above can be summarized as a change of thought direction in philosophy breakthrough time,when wise philosophers both from Confucian and Taoist school in the Pre-Chin Dynasty were confronted with the dilemma of the limits of reason.It also makes a sharp contrast with being towards deathin Heidegger's Existentialism philosophy.",

The senses’ respective representational modes, styles, and structures differ very strongly from each other. (2) The Layering thesis. A single sensory representation usually has more than one content; the perceptual state represents one object or property by representing a more primitive or less ambitious one. Though this “layering” is ubiquitous, its structure and range differs dramatically as between sense modalities, and in some modalities it works unexpectedly: for example, nearly all tactual representation derives from representation of conditions of or in the subject’s own skin, meaning that touch represents, e.g., the texture of a physical object by, and only by, representing stress within the skin; also the tactual layering is remarkably fine-grained and rich. (3) Aspect perception. Besides the intrinsic interest of “perceiving as”—even popular appeal, what with joke ambiguous figures such as the duck-rabbit and the old/young woman—it remains especially mysterious. Nearly all work on it has concerned vision only. But it is crucial for understanding auditory representation, which is one thing that distinguishes hearing from the other senses. Further, the auditory case greatly reinforces the idea that perceiving-as depends on expectations, it severely damages what we had thought was the best further approach to understanding aspect perception, in terms of attention.",

However, in spite of its evident importance, the term was for a long time little used. Today, the trickster has been recognised as a dominant figure in mythologies and folktales all around the world. Apart from the various animal-trickster figures present throughout the world – such as snake, spider, fox, monkey, raven, coyote, hare – main mythological figures include the Greek Hermes and Prometheus, Nordic Loki, or Irish leprechaun. While the exact characteristics of the figure differ across time and space, its overall description is surprisingly similar, offering a consistent image. The trickster is an outcast outsider who cannot participate, cannot share genuine emotions, and is incapable of trusting or giving. It also cannot respect limits, especially concerning bodily functions: eating, drinking, and sexual behaviour. Under liminal conditions, however, the outcast outsider might suddenly capture power, instead of a charismatic hero.",

      "abstract": "This work calls upon the so called ANT (actor-network theory) to approach the obstetric ultrasound technology as an ‘indispensable’ technology in prenatal monitoring in Rio de Janeiro at the turn of the 21st century. It does not envisage to build an exhaustive list but rather to perform a set of heterogeneous elements which by acting in juxtaposition configure the specificity of the studied technology, allowing for its delimitation and naming. The hybrid elements that are presented here - equipment, didacticism, assurance, oracle, affections, prestige, market, media, pathology, purification – are configured and understood as agents or actants which simultaneously are: 1) natural but without previously established forms that are already out there to be ‘simply’ discovered (not “things-in-themselves”); 2) collective but not social if this adjective refers to belonging to an exclusive world of relations of “humans-among-hemselves”; and yet 3) narrated but not constituted solely by discourse. The purpose of this work is to perform a distance from the tradition of the great a priori dividers which predominate in the studies of the so-called modern knowledge in the last few centuries: natural x social, public x private, heart x mind, science x belief, human x non-human, male x female, macro x micro, local x global. Our special interest is that, to the extent that this distance is obtained, other landscapes can be reached by Brazilian and Latin American STS (science-technology- ociety studies) – there, to say it somewhat crudely, that which exists is that which acts, and only hybrids have the capacity to act. The next step of this work, here indicated but not completed, is to study where the actions that configure the above elements take place and by which means (material vehicles) they communicate, articulate and act one upon other among themselves.",

It is at this point that he begins his long social conditioning history. His dependence on other people may lessen and his dependent behavior may change in form, but the class of behavior most generally labeled social behavior remains, and in many ways becomes more firmly controlled by other people. In our complex society the lack of social behavior is unheard of except in the extreme cases of the psychotic and the retarded, and even here there is most often evidence for some minimal social behavior. Living together is of course not restricted to man; animals also display social behavior. The definition of social behavior is then quite simple: It is behavior which varies as a function of other organisms—other organisms may elicit the behavior, set the occasion for it, or reinforce it. Furthermore, the behavior need not occur in the presence of other organisms to be called social—it may be related to other organisms only through stimuli which were once associated with them.",

Victims of crimes and ‘acts of God’ are traumatized not just by physical injuries but much more by the psychological torture of self-blame and un-forgiveness. To initiate a process of healing, the offender must seek for forgiveness; the victim must forgive as a means of liberating the offender and himself, and the process must entail a structure of restitution, for to forgive without requiring the other to change is not only self-destructive, but ensures that a dysfunctional relationship remains. Hence, a liberating forgiveness, even though it is growing in the act of not holding things over people, must be executed in such a manner that it neither approves, nor excuses the offense as to give the offender the leverage to perpetrate his crime.",

      "title": "The Path of Altruism: <i>A Reflection on the Nature of a Gift and Its Consequences in Leading to Entitlement or Enhancement</i>",
      "abstract": "The author offers an instructive distinction between a gift and a transfer. A gift enhances the human and intellectual development of another; a transfer might initiate the downhill slide of another into the state of victimhood known as entitlement. Every act we perform toward another, whether individually or through our social capital as philanthropists, has these two possible outcomes. The author then distinguishes between three possible meanings for the concept of obligation: a duty, a responsibility, or compassion and gratitude. He proposes that any act toward another that begins as a duty will likely lead to dependence and reduction of the human spirit. An action that creates in another a state of “being entitled” carries with it, for that person, a significant risk of becoming, in his or her own eyes, a victim with an ever-deepening loss of self-awareness and personal freedom. When that obligation is viewed with a sense of responsibility, an important positive step is achieved in that giving responsibly requires of the donor active caring about whether the gift will harm another. Finally, when obligation is manifested through gratitude as compassion, it leads to the enhancement of one’s own spirit and to the enhancement of the spirits of those it touches. It is the practice of love for one’s fellow man. It is the essence of philosanthropos and thus of philanthropy. <b>TOPICS:</b>Wealth management, foundations &amp; endowments",

To Diogenes the arch-Cynic it meant, broadly speaking, two things; on the physical plane, contentment with the bare necessities of life 1); and on the spiritual level, complete detachment from the world and worldly values. The Musa'pxr was the man who had dispensed with the superfluous in every department of life and reduced his needs to a minimum. All that he required for his material well-being was food, shelter and clothing of the meanest sort 2); his spiritual needs could be satisfied by Virtue alone, the possession of which was sufficient to ensure happiness 3). The Cynic then, had no desire for wealth, knowledge, pleasure or friendship. In his mind all these would be classed together as unnecessary luxuries. Nothing, in fact, that was to be derived from any source external to himself had any value for him or could affect him in any way. This, of course, is xusapzvxc in its most uncompromising form, the form in which it was advocated by Diogenes and the Cynic of the Lucianic dialogue. In some of the later adherents of Cynicism the concept is less harsh. In Bion 4), for instance, atuocapxma. becomes not so much a stern renunciation of the world as an attempt to adapt oneself to the world and changing circumstances just as an actor adapts himself to, the varied roles he has to play. But this is clearly not the orthodox Cynic view though it does not verge so far towards heresy as that of Peregrinus who is said to have denied the possibility of complete Self-Suf-",

      "abstract": "Can and will a person become an organ donor? Before such an altruistic act will occur, there is the ethic behind the action. There is an internalization of an ethic that the person agrees or disagrees with organ donation, no matter the variant. There is a large sense of agency and responsibility over the integrity of one’s body. We do care what our “network” thinks about our personally held norms of living donation and sanctity of the body. I present the position that understanding of the norms of living organ donation requires an examination of the personal social “network” surrounding the potential donor. Networks rely on connection which may lead to deliberate consensus building (or a reason to conform in order to limit disharmony). But I argue, even when there is a supportive social environment supporting a particular bioethical value, there will be some level of network level engagement with others in this process (for better or for worse).",

In this complex of relationships, human beings essentially find and define themselves, others, and the things around them, while also being defined by the latter. The world is not to be confused with any entity or thing within it. Since taking something to be is typically construed as convertible with taking it to be an entity, Heidegger cautions against claiming that the world is. In order to ward off the possibility of construing the existence (the ontological status) of this complex with that of anything else (especially things, tools, objects within it as well as the subject-matters of any particular science), Heidegger early on coins the neologism “worlding” (welten), to which he frequently has recourse later (GA56/57:73; GA9:164/126; GA7:181/PLT 177; GA12:26/PLT 203; GA5:30f/22f; GA38:168/140).",

      "title": "Towards future routines of post-creative making?",
      "abstract": "In discussions on AI, the emerging experimental subfield of artificial creativity—that is, acts of creativity performed (semi-)autonomously by algorithmic/software robots—poses a particular set of problems. First of all, the prospect of a robotic/algorithmic creativity relatively independent of human intervention fundamentally conflicts with the anthropocentric ways in which we have historically invented ‘creativity’; as something uniquely and quintessentially human. Secondly, while recognisability and predictability are parameters that are usually held as vital for the success of robots that in some way or the other are to be enmeshed in a future sociality comprised of Men and Machines, our expectations of what constitutes something we might label 'creative’ deeply hinges upon the exact opposite, namely: an imperative of unpredictability and the somewhat unrecognisable (cf. reigning ‘creativity standards' of openness, originality, newness, surprise, unconventionality, even the exceptional). Ideas, that are not just being celebrated within pedagogy and psychology (as a means to self-actualisation, etc.) but also as part of a global political economy of invention and (creative) disruption. This paper will engage with the question how we might reinvent ‘invention’, recreate ‘creativity’. How could we accommodate for a potential artificial creativity, and how can it become routinised both in our thinking and doing/making? Various anthropologies, sociologies and philosophies of technology, materiality, things and stuff (cf. Ingold, Latour, Verbeek, Bennett, Marres, Boscaglia, etc.) have given us a fairly apt vocabulary for conceptualising these various human-technology entanglements and the (quasi-)agency of our nonhuman tools and milieus. Drawing on these theories, this paper will examine the Flow Machines-project, an AI-research project on popular music composition, which has recently released the album “HelloWorld” under the alias SKYGGE. We will look at its affordances, its actual outcomes (creative products) as well as the discursive framing that seeks to position it in relation to both an anthropocentric creativity and a future post-(anthropocentric) creativity, theoretically and in practice.",

      "title": "David Mamet's Old Neighborhood: Journey and Geography",
      "abstract": "requires a geography: for a process to occur, there must be a site. The journey is both a physical act and an idea of it, journey; and its geography is not nowhere but involves city, country, ocean, planets, Eden, heaven, hell, paradise--any of which would allow thought of them worlds. Among these settings, the journey is constituted both of the movements between worlds, which should, to qualify journey, form some sort of pattern (if nothing more than getting from to B), and of possible ideas such purpose, circumstances, outcome, and design. Odysseus, for instance, is not merely wafted by ocean and breeze meanderings. Talk about his wanderings will consider the possible purposes, circumstances, etc., of his journey; and wandering might be considered an idea opposed to directness, a represented action akin to the indirectness of poetic language opposed to scientific or philosophical language. In the drama, characters enter and leave the stage--moving between a stage and some other or imagined one on missions and with purposes; they might be entering or exiting to deliver a message or they might be A Long Day's Journey or a trip Into the Woods. The journey object of thought might be imaginative or actual. I shall pursue the idea image and metaphor and culturally generated and transmitted-concept. My thinking about a journey is grounded in Edmund Husserl's phenomenology, his definition of intentionality and his concern for the need to experience pure essences. Husserl tries to recover experience from the reductive assignment of reality to either the subjective or the objective dimensions, a split remains in psychologism and science. That essence, Husserl argues, be exemplified intuitively in the data of experience, data of perception, memory, and so forth, but just readily also in the mere data of fancy (Phantasie) (50). The imagination, then, can capably discover what is essential to experience, the eidetic image reveals itself when presuppositions are put into suspension. The imagination is especially well qualified to perform this task, since it does not posit the image simply real in the there. This phenomenological approach is a ground for the contemporary archetypal thinking of James Hillman, who is attempting to rehabilitate Jungian images for a phenomenological psychoanalysis. Hillman's concern is to deactivate traditional epic stereotypes, the Titanic myth, which practically keeps us still in the pattern of the heroic ego (158). In addition to his polytheistic psychology's allowing a pantheism of images to come into play, he suggests a counter-image to the Titan is the Knight Errant, whose path has been deviant ever since Parmenides decried loose-limbed wandering the way of error, deceptive opinion, going astray (161). My looking toward essential images in Husserl and Hillman aims for the possibility of noticing recurring, persistent patterns and characteristics appear and transform themselves amidst cultural diversity. I might appeal, too, to the apprehension of ourselves readers and interpreters in the approaches of intertextual and possible worlds theories. The way I have related Husserl and Hillman might be taken in terms of intertextuality. One definition of intertextuality seems to echo both the Husserlean eidetic and Hiltman's archetype: as the enlargement of a familiar idea ... intertextuality might be taken a general term, working out from the broad definition of influence to encompass unconscious, socially prompted types of text formation (for example, by archetypes or popular culture); modes of conception (such ideas 'in the air'); styles (such genres); and other prior constraints and opportunities for the writer. Under this rubric, my pursuit of the journey image in David Mamet's plays would appear to be, I trust, a productive errancy. Lubomir Dolezel's argument for the possible worlds outlook opposed to the One-World Frame, which assumes that there is only one legitimate universe of discourse (domain of reference), the actual world (2), pursues a kind of intertextuality in setting up the Classical against the Modern Myth (185-98). …",

Furthermore, remaining faithful to the programmatic declaration of never wanting to stray from the authority of Christ (Acad. 3, 20, 43), he specifies the ontological status of the soul by affirming that it is, in itself, mutable and therefore not of a divine nature, as Varro had argued. Nor is it a substance foreign to the body, as the Platonists claimed, because the soul has an appetitus ad corpus and, if it questions itself, it easily discovers that it desires nothing else «except to do something, to know with intelligence or with the senses, or only to live, as far as this is in its power» (nisi agendi aliquid, aut sciendi, aut sentiendi, aut tantummodo vivendi in quantum sua illi potestas est).",

The concept has at times had a similar function in Hinduism to the idea of history in Western thought, though with the important qualification that it operates at the individual rather than the societal level. For karma relates to this world, of which it supplies the causal structure and as such is distinct from the Absolute (but not necessarily from the deity, especially in bhakti Hinduism); it is, therefore linear in operation, since it necessarily proceeds from cause to effect. Incidentally, the common notion that belief in karma amounts to fatalism is based on a misconception, through failing to take into account the timescale involved; one's present condition is determined by one's own past actions and one's future condition is being determined in the present by one's actions, and thus a man is essentially what he has made himself and can make himself what he chooses.

      "title": "On Philosophical Synthesis",
      "abstract": "I do not think that a synthesis of the East and the West and of their different thought is possible. Apart from those points of contact which are due to the fundamental identity of the human mind and of the instruments at its disposal, the two trends of thought too often look at the same problems-nature, man, and God-and at their relations with each other altogether differently. Both in the East and in the West there are peculiarities far deeper than those encountered in Europe between AngloSaxon and Latin cultures or in Asia between Chinese and Hindu thought. Just as two persons educated in the same school do not see things in the same way and neither of them can be made to renounce his own views or to accept the other's, without losing his individuality, equally so is it with the East and the West. They are both what they are; in some points they agree, in others they maintain opposite views. The Western mind has made such progress along scientific paths that it places intellect above all else. What we want is knowledge and action. On the other hand, the East, despite its varieties of thought, has placed the accent on realization and experience. I do not say that these aspects of Western and Eastern culture should be taken rigidly, but certainly they cannot be denied. The real synthesis should first be achieved in man, in whom intellect and experience, knowledge and intuition, certitude and dreams, should be equally balanced. With us in the West, the prevalence of intellect has done away with this equilibrium; admiration for science and the facilities, now extant, for participating in scientific and intellectual conquests, so different from spiritual experiences, which cannot be imparted, are endangering even the East nowadays. So, in my opinion, both East and West, through their most representative personalities, should co-operate toward a reintegration of man, simply of man, whether Western or Eastern. In so doing, the cultural heritage of the East can greatly contribute in preventing both East and West from giving way to a dangerous idolatry of intellectualism.",

      "title": "Visual search speed is influenced by differences in shape arbitrariness",
      "abstract": "We hypothesized that the visual system is particularly tuned to those features which correlate with behaviorally relevant dimensions, and compared a few possibilities: how man-made an object is (naturalness), how often an object is eaten (edibility), how often an object is manipulated (manipulability), and the degree to which an object’s shape is arbitrary (shape arbitrariness; Prasada, 2001). For example, the shape of a hammer is more constrained by the kind of thing that it is (i.e., is less arbitrary) than the shape of a rock. Does variability in perceptual similarity among sets of small, inanimate objects correlate with behavioral ratings on any of these dimensions? We chose four sets (categories) of stimuli: manipulable artifacts (e.g., pens), non-manipulable artifacts (e.g., lamps), natural objects (e.g. pinecones), and fruits/vegetables. These categories did not differ on ratings of typicality, familiarity, internal details, and visual complexity, or in area, aspect ratio, contour variance, extent, spatial frequency, contrast, or luminance. Participants searched for a target image among distractors from the same or different category; they pressed a space bar when they found the target, and reported its location by clicking X’s that replaced the original images. For each category pairing, the difference in search speeds between same- and different-category trials was taken as an index of perceptual dissimilarity, and correlated with distances in each dimension for each subject (representational similarity analysis). Neither manipulability nor edibility explained the pattern of perceptual dissimilarity among categories (all r< .1, t< 1,p>.3). Although naturalness explained some variance (r=.16, t=2.13, p=.048), shape arbitrariness explained more (r=.40, t=4.05, p< .0001). Visual features correlated with shape arbitrariness include shape symmetry and regularity, according to ratings(r=.74, p< .001). These results suggest that, among inanimate objects, the visual system may be particularly sensitive to the perceptual features correlated with the arbitrariness of their shapes.

      "abstract": "All human beings experience life’s givens or the ultimate concerns of death, isolation, freedom, and meaninglessness. Whether there is awareness or not, these givens influence how individuals interact and relate to self, others, and the world. Failure to understand these existential concerns can lead an individual to behave inauthentically in relation to her core values. This article will illuminate the role of existential psychotherapy in revealing the effect of life’s givens on an individual’s lived experience. First, this article will ground existential therapy within its philosophical roots. Second, it will highlight the use of the phenomenological method in existential psychotherapy as a means of building a strong therapeutic alliance between therapist and client. Attention to the client’s lived experience in a value-free way will provide space for the client to work through his or her existential anxiety toward authenticity. The client, in feeling deeply understood will be able to respond more authentically to the therapeutic relationship and by extension to others in his or her world. A framework for understanding how life’s givens can manifest across the physical, personal, social, and spiritual life dimensions are presented. This framework is used to conceptualize a case study of a client struggling with existential issues.",

Allah Almighty has given all the means to accept or reject it. The power of logic is irrefutable fact, but if the quest for righteousness is not available then one cannot get righteousness. If the man is headstrong, egotist and reluctant then these attitudes leads to aberration. The man who is on the right path should not think that he got this by his hard work.

Its course, however, maps itself out quite simply if, instead of taking apparently convenient shortcuts, it keeps to its right direction from the very beginning. For this three things are necessary: it must have nothing to do with an ethical interpretation of the world; it must become cosmic and mystical—that is to say, it must seek to conceive all the self-devotion that rules in ethics as a manifestation of an inward, spiritual relation to the world; and it must not lapse into abstract thinking, but must remain elemental, understanding self-devotion to the world to be self-devotion of human life to every form of living being with which it can come into relation.",

The Noble Eight-fold Path (ariya atthakgika magga) is a way to the cessation of suffering by \"rightly\" engaging in ordinary human activities such as speech, action, and livelihood. In addition to these ordinary activities of daily life, the Buddha also spoke to engaging the appropriate attitude, \"right view or understanding (samma ditthi),\"motivation or \"right intention or thought (samma sakkappa),\" and means or meditation practice (vipassanana bhavana) and mindful awareness (sati sampajañña) to achieve this disengagement from conditioned desires and patterns.

      "abstract": "The autobiographical process involves not just reporting on past events, reconstructing one’s life history, but replaying events in different voices and modes. It may be that the autobiographer is motivated by the desire to impose one version of her or his life and to scotch the others. Even then, however, other versions, the ones under erasure, often show through the fabric – the fabrication – and we detect their traces in the turns of the rhetoric. Thus, in autobiography, the real agenda is often underneath, either because a less official motive lurks behind the manifest ones or because what really drives the project of selfscrutiny is something only progressively revealed in the process of writing. This issue takes into consideration the structuring implications of turning points in the account of a life and the roles of the converse forces of forgetting and subjective destabilisation. There are two ways of looking at turning points: either as causative agents of order and coherence or as metaphors – as provisional, semi-fictional, forensic, cognitive instruments. In the latter case, they belong to an active, performative, conjectural, self-revising process, and they complement a version of autobiographical memory that involves a constant interplay of remembering and forgetting.",

On the one hand, to feel ashamed is to feel badly about oneself ; but on the other hand, it also seems to be a response to the way the subject is perceived by other people. So whose standards is the subject worried about falling short of, his own or those of an audience? I begin by arguing that it is the audience's standards that matter, and then present a theory of shame according to which shame is a response to the subject's perception that he is not thought of in the way he intrinsically values himself for being thought of by someone else. Then I go on to suggest some refinements to this basic view. First, the subject of shame is primarily concerned about his audience's attitudes toward him, not what they believe about him. And second, there may be one particular attitude which he values himself for inspiring. There is no very perspicuous term for this attitude, so I call it ‘proto‐respect’ – the attitude a social animal directs toward those it regards as valuable allies or bad enemies.",

Talking treatments would therefore benefit by drawing from broader and deeper intellectual and artistic traditions. Philosophers, for example, have considered questions about identity, meaning and purpose for millennia. Given that moral development has in no way kept pace with technological progress in the 20th century, we would be unwise to draw only from contemporary thinkers in making sense of our predicament. We cannot escape from philosophy: when people say that they do not know any philosophy, what is really meant is that they know only one philosophy, but they have no means of locating or assessing it. As a result, it structures everything they do and care about. It also prevents them from considering alternatives or placing immediate preoccupations into a larger perspective.",

      "abstract": "Did a separate Theravada school of Buddhism actually exist as a discernible entity before the modern period? Can we talk about Theravada Buddhism as a field of study or as a religion bounded by a distinct set of texts, rituals, beliefs, and institutions? The term “Theravada” is rarely found in texts in South and Southeast Asian languages before the 19th century. Moreover, Theravada is mistakenly associated with “early Buddhism,” even though there is no evidence that it was anything more than one of many intellectual, ritual, and organizational lineages in early Indic Buddhism. More properly instead of talking about an amorphous Theravada sect or school, scholars have started to trace ordination and teaching lineages, or look at the degree to which other categories such as araññavāsī/pupphārāmavāsī (forest/flower garden-dwellers) or gāmavāsī/nagaravāsī (village/city-dwellers), or ganthadhura (those who carry the burden of [textual] study) and vipassanādhura (those who carry the burden of meditation practice) were used in different places. Scholars have yet to define the contours of the Theravada. Therefore, the field has been divided into the citations that follow to reflect the tension between local anthropological and textual works and larger national, regional-based, and general studies. Unfortunately, space restraints limit the works cited to those written in Western languages and exclude the large numbers of studies on “socially engaged Buddhism” that has become quite popular in recent years and demands a separate bibliographic entry.",

      "abstract": "Man is a social being who lives together with other persons. To live peacefully one another in the very complicated and money-driven society each of human beings has to practice the art of living together with others. Man himself should remain as man who has an ability to treat other as man who deserves human dignity, otherwise man is apt to fall down into an animal-being who is thought to be opposite to a human being. In the period of economic crisis man concentrates himself only to survive in a society hard to keep living, so he has no room to think how to live a morally good life and it becomes hard for him to make an effort to be a morally good person. When he thinks of (biological) existence only, it is almost hard for him to reflect and lead his (moral) life. At the time of the oppression of poverty and economic depression mutual care between fellow -human beings is required to live together. Obviously a human being starts his life as a biological person, but he should strive to be a being human who is a moral person. The biological person is only a person before he makes himself be a moral one. The dignity of a person starts as the biological being, but the social recognition is given to the moral being. Therefore it is more important to ask who man is than what he is. A view of a human being shows the degree in which each estimates the dignity of man. Many people, especially including some animal ecological scholars and behavioristic psychologists, consider a human being as a member of the kingdom of animal. Some people regards him as machine producing goods, and some looks him as the goods itself. These three views underestimate the dignity of human beings. The fourth view is to look the man as a divine being who has the image of God. When we take the fourth view, it is possible for the human being to achieve the personality of the image of God. The question of 'who is man?' is morally more desirable than the Question of 'what is man?' A human being needs a model to make him 'being human', because he has learned and continues to learn almost everything by imitating the life of model who is thought to have lead a morally good life. Some moral characteristics of the good model of being human contain, I think, at least virtues like responsibility, humility and love. These three virtues should be considered as the fundamental ones for the achievement of the human task of 'being human' and 'right living.'",

      "abstract": "In Samuel Beckett’s Waiting for Godot, the main characters’ hat and boots allegorize skandhas (five aggregates) that are supposed to compose the self; their hat seems to represent samjna (perceptions), sankhara (mental activity or formations) and vijnana (consciousness) while their boots, rupa (form) and vedana (sensations). And Godot might be seen as the essence of the self. Then, Vladimir and Estragon’s hopeless waiting for Godot implies that they do not possibly fulfill their essential self-identity.BR As well-known, the Buddhist view of self, rejecting any inherent components of the human self, asserts that the five aggregates constitute the human being’s mental and physical existence. And suffering arises when humans cling to the aggregates. Then, because the main characters do not stop waiting for Godot, they cannot evade despair and mental instability. However, there is a Buddhist hole through which they can escape; Pratityasamupata (the Buddhist theory of dependent arising) allows the human beings to be freed from sufferings that arise when they identify with the five aggregates. Then, Vladimir and Estragon would fulfill freedom when they quit their hopeless waiting. In other words, they can ‘move’ when they realize the dharma that their self (skandhas) is in a ceaseless process of dependent interaction with other selves.",

      "abstract": "According to the standard account of forgiveness, you forgive your wrongdoer by overcoming your resentment towards them. But how exactly must you do so? And when is such overcoming fitting? The aim of this paper is to introduce a novel version of the standard account to answer these questions. Its core idea is that the reactive attitudes are a fitting response not just to someone’s blameworthiness, but to their blameworthiness being significant for you, or worthy of your caring, in virtue of your relationship to it. Someone’s blameworthiness is significant for you to the extent you’re bound up with what grounds it––e.g. with the wrongdoer’s being a participant in human relationships, with their attitudes, or with the victim’s being a source of demands. So you may fittingly not care about someone’s blameworthiness if it’s sufficiently insignificant for you in this manner––e.g. if their wrong happened far off in place and time. And forgiveness revolves around this. You (fittingly) forgive your wrongdoer if and only if, partly out of goodwill towards them, you (fittingly) cease to care about their blameworthiness––a bit as if their wrong had happened far off. If I’m right, this agent-relativity-based account can resolve the apparent ‘paradoxy of forgiveness’ (Kolnai 1973), satisfies a number of desiderata, and is plausible on an intuitive level.",

      "abstract": "Bereavement pertains to the state of having lost a loved one to death and the time period after. The expression is used interchangeably with the term, grief; which is descriptive in essence, often articulated as a series of psychological, physical, behavioural and emotional responses. Grief is also used more broadly than bereavement, incorporating other losses an individual may experience over a lifespan (Zisook & Shear, 2009). It cannot be disputed both terms appear with some inconsistency within literature; however this editorial will refer to bereavement as an emotional state experienced after a death and grief as a process.\n\nThe emotional and sometimes physical pain experienced after a death will be different for everybody; with no correct formulae on how to feel or what to do once a loss is experienced. Although similar responses will occur amongst individuals, no two experiences will be exactly the same, so comparisons are futile as factors such as personality, mental health, coping skills, support systems, the nature of the relationship with the deceased person, the experience of illness, how the disease progressed and time frames will all play a contributing role (Australian Centre for Grief and Bereavement, 2015).",

      "abstract": "Self-regarding acts are frequently classified as non-moral; even more frequently, they are assumed to have less moral weight than parallel other-regarding acts. I argue briefly against the first claim, and at greater length against the second. Our intuitions about the lesser moral weight of self-regarding acts arise from imperfectly recognized, and morally relevant, differences between acts which are ordinarily described in misleadingly parallel phrases. ‘Love of self,’ for instance, and ‘love of another’ are not symmetrical attitudes, in spite of the symmetrical grammar. More obviously, one cannot steal from, lie to, nor force oneself in the same way one can do these things to others. I conclude, therefore, that difference in moral weight never stems merely from a difference in the person concerned (myself or another), but rather from differences between the actions themselves; furthermore, that whatever it is wrong to do to a willing other, it is wrong to do to oneself.",

This paper defends this view by arguing that it is consistent with thinking of God as God's incorporeal, omniscient, immutable, and timeless. It is inconsistent with the claim that God lacks a plurality of properties; but one does not need to hold anthropomorphism to find simplicity with respect to properties implausible.",

Yet, habits exonerate me from reflecting each time about the proper way to act under given circumstances. Thus, acting on the basis of habit means to act unreflectively and involuntarily. The ‘habitual self’ is opposed to the ‘reflecting self’. Habit actually is the power of forgetting. It is not unconscious in a psychodynamic sense; rather it is a form of unreflecting, inattentive, practical Cogito. As such, it is another form of dissociated spontaneity, next to drive and emotion, which may surprise me, especially when it prescribes me a given action that is inappropriate to the circumstances. Habit is what lets me discover alterity as repetition in the course of my intersubjective life.",

      "abstract": "Two foundational ethicists of care, Nel Noddings and Eva Feder Kittay, limit the moral community of care to humans. Noddings claims that the reciprocity required for her care ethic cannot be universally present in human relationships with non-humans. Kittay advances that her care ethic requires the cared-for’s assent, or “taking up” of the care, in response to the carer’s actions, which she claims is impossible with non-human cared-fors. But these claims can be disputed. I offer a few examples to contend that ethically meaningful reciprocity is possible in some human relationships with more-than-human entities and that some non-human cared-fors can assent to carers’ actions. Following from the work of Mary Anne Warren and others on moral personhood, “humans” and “persons” can refer to different things: biological organisms and a designation of moral status respectively. There can be persons that are not humans (e.g., legal persons like corporations and chimpanzees, and moral persons like whales and dolphins). Because the concerns of Noddings and Kittay can be addressed and there are non-human persons, I argue that we should reject the human restriction within care ethics. Humans have morally significant relationships with non-human persons and we need to open the realm of care ethics to legitimize and enhance these other relationships in our rich communities.",

      "abstract": "some influence -upon Lope at this time made him more conscious of the problem of the will and the fatalistic implications of predestination in the plays· The contradictions in Lope's practice and, attitudes -(between fatalism and free will, for example, or between Fortune as a servant of God'ánd Fortune as an irrational independent co- or counter-divinity) can be partly explained by the tendency 'in the comedia, as in other literature of the period, to view life successively from different perspectives. If one takes a long-range view, life is a marvelous unity of Heaven-directed order and reason, an idea often expressed by Lope's characters; in such a universe Fortune and Fate can be identified with Cod's purposes. If, on the other hand, one views life, as Lope's characters also do at times, from the blindness and isolation of the moment and the individual , it appears confused and unstable, and men seem irrational, depraved, and remote from God; Fortune and Fate then lose their divine attributes and are identified with man's corrupt nature and the undependability of life on earth, as targets for men's invectives and pessimism. The terms \"determinism\" .and \"predestination\" are used here. with no specific scientific or theological connotation, but only in the general sense of a predetermination of the events of a lifetime. 2 I am indebted to Professor Otis H. Green for a concept which helps to explain the acceptance of. such devices, the orinciple of fingimientos de poetas, which permitted the poet the license of imagining unorthodox situations and details with which to embellish his writings, not to be taken seriously by his readers. A NOTE ON CALDERÓN 'S EL ASTRÒLOGO FINGIDO by, Max Oppenheimer, Jr., Washington University, St, Louis 5, Mo, According to H. W. Hilborn (A Chronology of the Plays of D. Pedro Calderón de la Barca, Toronto, 1938, pp. 6-7 and 9-11), the versification of El Astrólogo fingido and internal evidence (the mention of an intended departure for Flanders by one of the characters is reminiscent of Calderón 's own plans to depart for the wars in the north during the period 1623-25) point to the probability that the date for this comedia is about 162U-25. Professor Hilborn used the Hartzenbusch text of this comedia (BAE, VII, 573-593) to analyze its versification. His findings are listed in the table below. Hartzenbusch established the BAE text of El astrólogo fingido mainly by combining the text of the comedia as it appears in Parte XXV de diferentes autores, Zaragoça, 1632, with the one printed in Calderón's Segunda Parte, Madrid, 16UI, thus supplying lines missing in the I632 text from the 16Ul text, and vice-versa. (See my edition of the comedia, an unpublished thesis, Univ. of South. Calif., L.A., 19U7, p. 27. I am now revising this edition for eventual publication.) the I6UI text is identical, except for a few minor emendations, with that appearing in the 1637 edition of the Segunda Parte (See HR, 19U8, XVT, 336), and we know that the difference between this latter text and the 1632 version is enormous. There are U99 verses in the 1632 text, and 206 verses in the 1637 text that are absent from the 16\"3.2 text. Despite these striking discrepancies, an analysis of the versification of each of these two texts of El astrólogo fingi.do shows essentially the same. composition as that found by Hilborn in the Hartzenbusch edition, throwing no new light on the matter.

      "title": "Social Pressure",
      "abstract": "Social Pressure Teresa Brennan 1. Preamble: It has become habitual to think of the social as immaterial or unphysical, as something which does not enter into or physically affect the body. Despite the strong evidence of psychosomatic disorders, or the logical deductions that follow from the facts that words and images are physical entities as well as conveyors of meaning, social theory continues to think the relation between the physical and the social in terms where either the biological may (some claim) or may not determine the social, but where the social does not have material effects on the body. In other words, the only alternative to sociobiology, 1 which misconceives and reduces the relation at issue to one of biological determination, appears to be a social without physical materiality. The theory of social physicality I have developed 2 is premised on the notion that the opposition between the social and the biological is itself misconceived to the extent that it conjures up an idea of the social as immaterial, as lacking matter and/or energy. 3 The opposition between the social and the biological was built into sociology’s foundations: Durkheim for instance, as Giddens has it, is concerned with “the specific characteristics of the class of phenomena which may be delimited as ‘social’ and thereby separated from other categories such the ‘biological’ and ‘psychological’” (Giddens 1971, 86). But while I agree that the social is specific to itself and independent of biology, and that it also exists independently of personal psychology, the social as I will define an aspect of it here (which we will call “social pressure”) is nonetheless physical. Moreover it is not that the biological determines the social. It is rather that the physicality of the social enters into [End Page 257] and even determines biology, and for that matter, the environment. It follows that human organisms will have physical differences consequent on their different “socializations.” 4 In this essay I will elaborate on the theory of social physicality in relation to aging. We are all familiar with the discrepancies between those who age “well” and those who do not, between an apparent retardation of aging and its untimely acceleration. Such discrepancies suggest that a social level impinges on the biological level. At the same time, the fact of aging seems to legitimate the distinction between the social and the biological for the very reason that while some of us age poorly and some well, we all ultimately age. The thing that varies (how we age) is not the same as the thing that is varied (the fact of aging). The fact of aging is presented to us as a biological fact. But my point will be that the social variations or accelerations and retardations in how we age, while biological in their effects, have to have a material existence that involves something more than somatic biology. The nature of that material existence, I will suggest here, is physical. Thus it may be that the “social” which affects the body can be understood in terms of physics (this is what social physicality is about); while the body of course belongs to biology. In other words, what I am suggesting is that we reflect on the appositeness of the distinction between the biological and the physical in rethinking an issue which otherwise remains intractable. If I am right in this approach, it would be more correct to say not that a critical dimension of the social is biological, but that it is physical, a force that interacts with and affects the biological body. The distinction between the physical and the biological, while frequently collapsed in the humanities and social sciences, is long-standing. 5 But the distinction is needed in the social sciences. Apart from its use in explaining changes in the organism that are not consequent solely on biological developments, the distinction is necessary if one is to resolve a paradox: as Ingold points out, “biology” is meant to be about the increasing differentiation of forms, and how organisms grow in distinctiveness (1990, 214). I add that socialization by contrast is about how these organisms conform to common [End Page 258] modes of behavior and...",

The broadest category is behavior, understood as any bodily movement whose origin is internal to the agent, not external (as when he is carried away by a landslide). Action is intentional behavior, caused by the desires and beliefs of the agent. Thus reflex behaviors are not actions; having an erection is not an action (but it may be induced by one, such as taking Viagra); falling asleep is not an action (but may be induced by taking a sleeping pill). An action may or may not be preceded by a conscious decision. When I drive to work along my usual route I do not consciously decide to turn right here and left there, although each action is intentional or goal-oriented. The very first time or times I drove to work, however, the actions were preceded by explicit decisions. In fact, they were preceded by an explicit choice among alternative paths. Although all choices are decisions, the converse is not true. When I decide to pick up the book I have been reading, I need not have any explicit alternative in mind. I see the book on the table; the sight reminds me that I have enjoyed reading it; and I decide to pick it up. No choice is involved.",

      "abstract": "For persons with dementia, engaging in joint activities like storytelling is fraught with challenges related to the fact that fewer linguistic and cognitive resources are available, compared with before the disease. Of particular importance are challenges concerning finding words and names, constructing utterances and stories, as well as remembering events and stories—and the combined effect of these. Having fewer resources available makes it difficult to tell stories in conversations, to listen to others’ storytelling, or to identify and grab a turn in a conversation to put in a word. One alternative is for the person with dementia to use <italic>embodied resources</italic>. The person with dementia can use other resources in combination with abilities that are still fully functional. Instead of gestures accompanying words in a story, gestures can take the lead role, with words only stressing or supporting bodily gestures, or gestures may even replace words entirely.",

No, it is the uncanny that proffers it provided that is the latter is endowed with speech. Freud thinks so, noting that it often happens that neurotic men declare that they feel there is something uncanny about the 'female genital organs'. Uncanny phenomena can occur during a session, whose fruitfulness may be compared with undergoing episodes of depersonalization. Among others, it is at these moments, or when they return, and almost throughout the whole of life, that the uncanny finds the opportunity of manifesting itself more or less spectacularly. The episode was free of all anxiety. On the other hand, in this strange, uncanny atmosphere, a certain curiosity, perplexity and uneasiness were undoubtedly being expressed.",

      "abstract": "The view that charity consists in an expansion of existing interpersonal relations is rather misleading. We need to see it as a radical transformation, of existing relations, even if this suspension is only temporary. In charity we see a person as someone who is no longer capable of reacting appropriately. Someone who is no longer capable of behaving as a „person‟ nevertheless continues to be a person. She does not lose her personal sanctity or dignity even if she has lost a practical grasp on controlling and guiding the course of her life. Today we often tend to reduce charity to a compassionate form of helping, or aid-giving, such as when materials, doctors and psychologists are sent to regions that are torn apart by war or famine. It is much easier to understand charity when it can be measured against the reduction of physical and emotional distress. It is much more difficult to understand charity in cases where aid proves to be powerless, when there is no measurable return or change that is brought about. While ethics cannot teach us what to do once compassion, benevolence and forgiveness fail to make any difference, prayer can help us to move forward. Praying for others, more specifically, the long-suffering involved in prayer, is a particularly important form of charity. It has the power to lift us above our inability to do anything helpful. We pray at the very moment when we experience our powerlessness to help.",

The attempts to connect it with any sociological phenomenon are purely absurd, and would not have been noticed but for their association with one or two famous names and the complete ignorance of non-European systems of relationship prevailing among the scholars of an older generation. There is no system under which a woman is closer akin to her sister's children than to her own; for under father-right a nephew or niece is further off than an own child, and if the system be pushed to the most logical and most absurd extremity, so as to make a child kin to his father only, not his mother, then he is also no kin to his mother's sister; under mother-right, which Rome never had in any form whatsoever, the mother is still nearer kin than the maternal aunt; while if ever there was, anywhere in the world, a classificatory system so pure and rigorous as to make no distinction between the actual mother and any other woman of the same age-class, then mother and aunt were in the same degree of kinship to every member of the younger generation.

      "abstract": "Immortality is a concept which is embedded not only in the religious systems, but also in the scientific hypotheses, concepts and theories. Religion, well-founded by a belief in the coexistence of this world and other worlds, is also based on the recognition of the superiority of the transcendent, the highest value of the absolute and the transcendent. A person with the ability to merge with the beginning inaccessible to sensuality is a dual being by its nature. The dualism of human nature nourishes faith in the achievement of immortality and the belief in the achievement of immortality by a human feeds dualism. The human is the holder of an immortal soul and a perishable body. The human is eternal (the concept of immortality becomes redundant) and confined (res extensa). Traditional for many people, is the point of view of the impossibility of achieving immortality by a person in the world without God. However, many scientists who reject belief in a transcendent principle are still trying to take measures to facilitate the increase in life expectancy, seeking to create a cure for old age, an elixir of life, a panacea for all diseases. Fundamental problems directly related to the concept of immortality are the following: firstly, the problem of finding the meaning of life and the meaning of life landmarks in the world where the binary opposition of otherworldly / worldly is destroyed; secondly, the identification of the metamorphosis of self-identification of a human preparing to gain longevity; thirdly, mental simulation to solve the problem of the meaning of life in a practical newfound immortality; fourthly, search for probable differences in relation to the meaning of life of a person who has not attained longevity (or does not know about the upcoming longevity) and a human who finds practical immortality. The notion of human mortality is immanent to philosophical systems. Some of them accept as a tribute, others, on the contrary, state the crisis of the being of a human arising in connection with the realization of the fact of death. Alternative discourse is the discourse of trans-humanism which illuminates the other pole, a different vision of the future of a human (being?). Transhumanists offer to go from episteme to life in the Web, to life absolutely caused by a mechanical Other. Change of the territory of a human as a natural being and reterritorialization in the space, the dependence on the operation of the machine ( machine aid?): these are the aspirations of transhumanism, a conceivable ultimate dream. Thus, there is a need in developing and strengthening of a different ideological paradigm, alternative to the ideas of death and radical transhumanist ideas. Not only the creation of a theory of immortology but also people''s real knowledge of its precepts are a priority.",

      "abstract": "Why Wittgenstein is Not Conservative: Conventions and Critique Christopher C. Robinson (bio) “Where in the world constructed of language is theory, and what has become of the theorist?” Sheldon S. Wolin Introduction When Wittgenstein looked at a particular neighborhood or form of life in the city of language what he examined were surface details and activities. Activities were performed with adherence to rules that were perhaps beneath the surface, but these subterranean features could be made visible by asking the question, “What is the rule for...?” or by a dispute over a play in a game that requires reference to the rules, or even by a behavioral faux pas that breached a rule or rules resulting in embarrassment. The rules themselves were the product of the activities visible on the surface. They affect the activities with incomplete and indeterminable reciprocity. As products or codifications of activities, the rules demarcate the activity from other activities (chess from checkers, for example), but at the same time these rules have a provisional character. That is, they can be amended, bypassed (with something akin to a “mulligan” in golf or a “do over” in some referee-less street game), or dropped altogether. Indeed, language-games and forms of life come into being and die out transforming what Wittgenstein called “the city of language” in small but distinctive ways. This city of language before us is actually a palimpsest where the surface includes traces of razed structures and older districts buried over by time. Older versions of the city become part of what counts as the bedrock upon which the newer city is built. Let me begin, then, with the image of the city of language presented by Wittgenstein the author of the Philosophical Investigations as opposed to Wittgenstein the flaneur that walked its pages. Wittgenstein the author is able to take the longer and wider view of the mapmaker; the walker cannot see the organizing parameters of the city from his street-level view but assumes there is a larger logic holding things together. The author’s cartographic description of the city is brief and occurs early in the Investigations to both illustrate the complex and living or incomplete quality of language and to set the dramatic stage upon which the philosophical walker will travel. Wittgenstein begins by responding to the objection that the language-games he has explored in the first seventeen remarks consist solely of orders (i.e. “Bring me a slab!” PI, 6, 19) A language composed of orders is incomplete, goes the objection. In articulating this criticism, Wittgenstein is repeating his own objection to the one-dimensional picture of language as representational advanced as complete in his Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus. Out of this self-criticism, then, Wittgenstein offers an image of language as more than an instrument or set of tools for the production of meaning. This “more than” quality of language is presented by Wittgenstein as unrepresentable and resistant to ontologization (as the “house of Being” for example) because of its dynamic character. The edges or limits cannot be seen from the outside (at least by humans), but they can be experienced or felt from the inside, or imagined and expressed synoptically from the God’s-eye standpoint of the author. One is a tourist even in his or her home city because of development or sprawl that alters the perimeter constantly, and because of the transformations, sometimes subtle and private, within neighborhoods on the inside. Each alteration tells a story. Our language may be seen as an ancient city: a maze of little streets and squares, of old and new houses, and of houses with additions from various periods; and this surrounded by a multitude of new boroughs with straight regular streets and uniform houses. [PI, 18] At the center is the historical beginning of the city. It is largely unplanned. Buildings and streets were added on as needed, but in a relatively compressed way to maintain convenience and defense in the form of propinquity. Squares fulfilled the need for public gathering spaces where goods could be sold and speeches and pronouncements made, heard, and debated. For a long time, the city was not designed, per se; it...",

A phenomenologist aiming for an account of the human person surveys these varied activities fishing for material suitable for his descriptions. Letting them be appearances, he studies them; refusing to be distracted, he distinguishes contemplatively between the fact that they beckon his belief, emotion, and intervention and the structure of their showing up to do so. His elevation of these particulars into philosophical description is intended to illuminate human activities for us who follow his sketch. If he has done his job, and if we have followed him well, we may now return refreshed from contemplation, diving back into commitment and involvement with the human world, less naive and with keener sight. The philosopher’s description cannot be illuminating if it merely repeats, describing the variety without abridgment; but any abridgement runs the risk of distortion. Still, some features are more crucial than others to what it is to be a human person. Some activities are clearer displays of the person; the cloudier images could mislead us terribly if taken as models, if not understood as degenerate in light of the clearest pattern. The phenomenologist must take a stand, marking some features as capital and others as detail, some as paradigmatic and others as derivative. That is, to avoid both triviality and distortion, the phenomenologist’s description must",

      "abstract": "Abstract A Large Group Within the category I have called the bit players is comprised of personal attendants: the servants, stewards, armor-bearers or “lads” of kings, prophets and other dignitaries. Like the briefly mentioned and unnamed mothers, husbands, and children, they are given scant narrative attention. What distinguishes personal attendants from unnamed family members, though, is the nature of the designated role itself. The servant participates in a hierarchical relationship in which he or she is the subordinate party. Because the task of the servant is to serve, the servant’s activity draws attention to the needs and desires of the one being served. In this way, servants identify the one they serve as a person of wealth and power. The nature of the servant role itself therefore adds another layer to the veil over the personal identity of these sketchy characters. Personal attendants are formally identified in a variety of ways. A youth (illl, o1illl) is not necessarily a personal attendant except when defined as such by the possessive form, such as “his young man” (iilll; 1 Sam 9:5, “the boy who was with him”), or the narrative context, as in 1 Sam 20:21, in which Jonathan tells David that he will send “the boy” (,i,m) to tell him whether he should flee from Saul. The designations servant (,:ii,) and youth (illl) can denote either a slave or servant.1 Most narratives featuring slaves/servants do not address their legal status.",

Humans have always estimated the risks of their actions or inactions in making personal decisions.

      "abstract": "While we can all have uncanny experiences from time to time, there are some patients who live with a permanent sense of estrangement from themselves and the world that surrounds them. Uncanny experiences, in particular those involving the body, gain predominance in adolescence. In some adolescents their difficulty in recognizing their body as their own can become very pronounced after puberty when they are faced with the reworking of the Oedipal conflict and the potential overpowering effect of their drives. In these cases the uncanny experience of a 'disquieting unfamiliarity' can be felt either in relation to parts of their body or to their whole body leading to a feeling of being inhabited by the double. Through detailed clinical material from a disturbed adolescent, the author shows how the double is the product of a process of dissociation, which involves a previous process of projective identification connected to the wish to enter the mother's body to either possess and/or control her, in particular her sexuality and procreativity.. As a consequence of this process, the individual can feel persecuted by the phantasy of an introjected object, which either now claims independence or threatens the subject with the possibility of taking over the whole of the body/ego and thus killing the host. The author proposes that the uncanny effect that accompanies the process of dissociation, and that is lived out through the phantasy of the double, is what paradoxically eases the ego's anxiety of being taken over by the delusional aspects and the potential of a total psychotic breakdown.",

      "title": "The direct perception hypothesis: perceiving the intention of another’s action hinders its precise imitation",
      "abstract": "We argue that imitation is a learning response to unintelligible actions, especially to social conventions. Various strands of evidence are converging on this conclusion, but further progress has been hampered by an outdated theory of perceptual experience. Comparative psychology continues to be premised on the doctrine that humans and nonhuman primates only perceive others’ physical ‘surface behavior’, while mental states are perceptually inaccessible. However, a growing consensus in social cognition research accepts the Direct Perception Hypothesis: primarily we see what others aim to do; we do not infer it from their motions. Indeed, physical details are overlooked – unless the action is unintelligible. On this basis we hypothesize that apes’ propensity to copy the goal of an action, rather than its precise means, is largely dependent on its perceived intelligibility. Conversely, children copy means more often than adults and apes because, uniquely, much adult human behavior is completely unintelligible to unenculturated observers due to the pervasiveness of arbitrary social conventions, as exemplified by customs, rituals, and languages. We expect the propensity to imitate to be inversely correlated with the familiarity of cultural practices, as indexed by age and/or socio-cultural competence. The Direct Perception Hypothesis thereby helps to parsimoniously explain the most important findings of imitation research, including children’s over-imitation and other species-typical and age-related variations.",

      "abstract": "Creativity involves the use of the imagination or original ideas in order to bring something in existence. Madness has to do with foolishness and things which are not sensible. It includes things done without thought or control. If we combine the two we can come to some very healthy conclusions. First, that we tend to use words, and these include creativity and madness, rather loosely, often, in contrast to what they actually mean, and in contrast to what can take us from mediocrity to greatness. Second, that all sensible human beings want happiness and abundance. People are miserable when their thoughts and deeds are poor. Third ,that we have to leave the mentally ill in the care of specialist doctors. It is not a topic we can resolve. Fourth, that every human being is creative. He can achieve great things if he is trained to use his mind wisely. We tend to use madness rather loosely. Most of us clamor to be in madly in love without realizing that mad men cannot sustain love. We are also mad when we indulge in negative emotions. Hysteria is nothing but extreme or uncontrollable excitement. It is a mental disorder. Madness in art and literature is often linked with genius. In reality, it is completely anti-life. Art is selective recreation of reality according to an artist s metaphysical value judgment. Literature re-creates reality by means of language. The most important principal of the esthetics of literature was formulated by Aristotle, who said that fiction is greater that history, because history represents things as they are, while fiction represents them as they might be and ought to be. This requires vision and what shape life should take, not for a dozen mad men but for the multitude of humanity.

      "title": "Unconscious Processes",
      "abstract": "Consciousness has to do with two aspects of mental life: monitoring ourselves, our phenomenal awareness of our experiences, thoughts, and actions; and controlling ourselves, engaging in voluntary behavior that goes beyond reflex, instinct, and conditioned response. The unconscious mind—whether it exists at all, and if so what its scope and limits are—has been an important theoretical issue since the beginning of scientific psychology. There are of course many physical and biological processes that, in some sense, proceed unconsciously: the orbiting of planets around the sun and photosynthesis are two examples. Changes in blood pressure are not accessible to phenomenal awareness; and the brain activity which gives rise to consciousness itself goes on unconsciously (neurosurgeons assure us that there is no afference in the brain). But there is little point in talking about something being unconscious if that same thing cannot also be conscious, in the sense of being accessible to phenomenal awareness and voluntary control. Therefore, the adjective unconscious only makes sense when applied to mental states and mental activity, as an adjectival contrast to conscious. Mental states come in various forms—namely cognition (percepts, memories, thoughts, and knowledge acquired through learning), emotion (positive and negative feelings), and motivation (desires and goals of approach and avoidance). Usually, these mental states are accessible to consciousness, in that people are generally aware of what they are thinking, what they want and feel. “The unconscious” is shorthand for mental states and processes that are inaccessible to introspective phenomenal awareness and voluntary control. The question is whether, and to what extent, mental states can exist (and mental activities transpire) outside the scope of phenomenal awareness and voluntary control. Objection: If these mental states and activities are unconscious, how are we to know them? Answer: We know them indirectly by virtue of their effects on our ongoing conscious experience, thought, and action. Question: If there are two kinds of mental states and processes, conscious and unconscious, how do they compare and contrast? Answer: In principle, unconscious processes differ from conscious processes because they operate outside phenomenal awareness. And because conscious awareness is the logical prerequisite for conscious control; unconscious processes are not susceptible to voluntary self-regulation. Other differences between conscious and unconscious processes are empirical questions. This revision adds items that appeared through 2022.",

      "abstract": "Moderate differentialists like Aristotle and I. Kant credited animals with \"lower\" mental/psychic phenomena like sentience, emotions, moods and perception, while denying the \"higher\" faculties of intellect and reason, including the capacity for genuine belief. Whether animals can draw theoretical and/or practical inferences is connected to the issue of animal rationality. A venerable tradition conceives of reason as a capacity to justify one's beliefs and actions, paradigmatically by deriving them from less-contentious assumptions. Animals face problems of discrimination, and some of them can solve these by distinguishing things according to their properties in a deliberate and considered manner. For the discriminations which underlie animal behavior need not coincide with people verbal classifications, either extensionally – by grouping together the same objects – or intensionally –by grouping objects according to the same properties. An intermediate position maintains that animals can possess some concepts, namely those that can be manifested in nonlinguistic behavior.",

      "abstract": "Since centuries ago or even more, the hula hoop has been practiced by people to keep their good health while having fun. Curiously, this simple toy made by a plastic ring, also previously made by a circle of willow, rattan, grapevines or stiff grasses, is subjected to several high and complex physical laws that make, at the same time, possible its beautiful movements. Physical laws are opposing and/or accompanying the movement of the circle-hoop-ring, such as gravity, centripetal force, friction, speed or velocity, and acceleration, in a torque or tendency to rotate. Specific muscles of the body are activated during hula hoop dancing and a general cardio exercise is happening. On the other hand, a stimulation of creativity is also occurring to make a mathematically reasonable and beautiful flow of movements for the own enjoyment or to make a performance for other people’s enjoyment. Then, the dancer with a hoop is moving the ring around several parts of his/her body (waist, core, shoulders, neck, arms), also rolling it over the body like a wheel, making waves in different axis, tossing it to the air or floor, etc. and dancer can jump him/herself through the hoop, or stealing its movements with his/her body. While motor learning happens, specific areas of the brain are activated differently during trials of learning. Then flow and fluid movements become automatic in an asymmetrical way considering our hand preference. However, for getting all this benefits, it is required a controlled practice in children and adults, that means a smooth and not violent, reasonable and measured practice in time and intensity and not negligent or irresponsible. Otherwise, some lesions have been described in literature.",

      "abstract": "Homer poses a rather mixed state of affairs to readers of an enlightened society. On the one hand, we find much that is familiar to us; on the other, we also find much with which we cannot identify ourselves at all. To us, Homeric society seems to be shaped entirely by conventional values: it does not appear to be greatly concerned with individuals. Furthermore, humans appear to be more or less robbed of the initiative for independent and self-directed action in Homer. Where we expect a free, autonomous decision, we find the Gods acting on behalf of humans. Indeed, the Gods do not merely influence humans from without; rather, they are also at work within them, so that Homer's humans appear to be, as Goethe once said, \"theomorphic\" in nature. But a closer engagement reveals that what appears foreign to us is actually often based on keen observation and an exceptionally nuanced understanding of the human psyche. As for the reasons why the opportunity to appropriate this foreign understanding was not pursued, we shall find that they lie in our \"modern\" expectations and prejudices which render us almost blind to whatever does not satisfy them. In a world in which the engagement with foreign cultures and religions has become an urgent task, Homer can offer an introduction to this task.",

The acts performed by other characters played no small part in affecting the course of events and the development of other characters. Unlike the other characters who bring about impacts through their ideas, emotions, and plans, Siegfried is important because of what his character represents, and what his character becomes and soon achieves. The fundamental significance of Siegfried’s character is to demonstrate how his type of heroism does not serve as a universal solution to Wotan’s problem of order and to other such problems.",

      "abstract": "After the death of a closely related person or of a friend, after the death of a beloved animal, but also after the loss of an important personal object, mourning is a normal and an important process. The mourner and the deceased person become a single social unit where specific burial rites are practiced. so that the dead, with the help of the living, can enter the land of the ancestors. Sometimes, however, the person in mourning develops psychiatric symptoms and needs help for this process. The process has become an adjustment disorder or even has caused the outbreak of another psychiatric disorder. Specific prolonged mourning can also take place when the deceased embodies a homeland or specific aspects of the self that has been lost to the mourner either through war or other traumatic identity displacements. Likewise, when a person's body is missing, but presumed dead, he/she cannot be buried and commemorated in a way that allows the mourner to find comfort and hope that the important traits and identity of the deceased will live on as an ancestor to give continuity, strength and advice to the living. This chapter focuses on how to handle a psychopathological mourning process and how this handling depends on psychiatric diagnostics.",

Sometimes we face bad incentives and take the bait. Sometimes, the problem is that we are conformists who don’t know how to say “no” and don’t even realize saying “no” is an option. Sometimes, the problem is that we operate on auto-pilot; we are blissfully unaware anything morally significant is at stake. Sometimes, the problem is that we suffer from self-deception and so trick ourselves into taking shortcuts. Sometimes, the problem is that we have run out of willpower and we haven’t learned to sustain our moral stamina.",

In general, their attacks are expressions of behavior depending on the animal’s breeding and learning and of varying manifestations depending on situations generated by man (3) (4) . Dogs have a complex social structure in which roles are determined in terms of dominant and subordinate. This is fundamental in the administration of resources and the cohesion of the pack. The domestic dog shows behavioral patterns proper of this social organization towards the people they live with as they substitute its pack. Hierarchies are established during its growth in which it has to learn its subordinate position under a dominance not always exerted by its owner which gives rise to conflicts such as aggression (4) (5) . When it is manifested, it is described as aggression for dominance. In general, dog owners constitute the group of people more frequently bitten, what can be explained through a higher contact with the animal and their tendency to a lesser avoidance of other people’s dogs and even of dogs without owners (6)",

      "title": "CONGEALING OIL: INVENTING IDEOLOGIES TO JUSTIFY ACTING IDEOLOGIES OUT",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT Studies of organizations in crisis show how forcefully and universally ideologies affect organizations, and life in general. Under the influence of societal and organizational ideologies, quite normal organizations manufacture crises for themselves, and then escape or succumb, depending on which ideologies dominate. Yet organization theorists have paid little attention to the ideological elements in organizations—apparently because of misguided perceptions that objectively measurable phenomena are more real or more important. Organization theorists have carried out numerous studies of so‐called objective phenomena, and their aggregate finding is that almost nothing correlates strongly and consistently with anything else. This null finding fits the hypothesis that organizational structures and technologies are primarily arbitrary, temporary, and superficial characteristics. These characteristics are determined by complex interactions among ideologies‐ although determined may be an inappropriate description because people acting under the influence of ideologies perceive that they are choosing freely. Ideologies are logically integrated clusters of beliefs, values, rituals, and symbols. The interactions among elements within an ideology enable a change by one element to produce far‐reaching effects. The interactions between ideologies are probably controlled by ceremonies and rituals, and communications between ideologies emphasize stylized or metaphorical language. One can see rituals and language at work when organizations are acting. Organizations can act in either of two modes: a problem‐solving mode in which perceived problems instigate searches for solutions, or an action generating mode in which choices of actions stimulate the creation of problems to justify the actions. Problem solving is abnormal, and action generating normal. In the action‐generating mode, people watch the results of their actions, appraise these results as good or bad, and propose needs for action. Whether needs for action are real is decided by collective voting in which votes are phrased as clichts about causation. These clichts give birth to quasi‐theories that explain why certain actions are needed to solve problems.",

      "title": "Consciousness: a neural capacity for objectivity, especially pronounced in humans",
      "abstract": "Consciousness tends to be viewed either as subjective experience of sensations and feelings, or as perception and internal representation of objects. This paper argues that neither view sufficiently acknowledges that consciousness may refer to the brain's most adaptive property: its capacity to produce states of objectivity. It is proposed that this capacity relies on multiple sensorimotor networks for internally representing objects and their properties in terms of expectancies, as well as on motivational and motor mechanisms involved in exploration, play, and care for vulnerable living and non-living objects. States of objectivity are associated with a very special phenomenal aspect; the experience that subjective aspects are absent and one is \"just looking\" at the world as it really is and can be. However, these states are normally closely preceded and followed by (and tend to be combined or fused with) sensations and feelings which are caused by activation of sensory and motivational mechanisms. A capacity for objectivity may have evolved in different species and can be conceived as a common basis for other elusive psychological properties such as intelligence, conscience, and esthetic experience; all three linked to crucial behaviors in human evolution such as tool making, cooperation, and art. The brain's pervasive tendency to objectify may be responsible for wrongly equating consciousness with feelings and wrongly opposing it to well-learned or habitual (\"unconscious\") patterns of perception and behavior.",

Must anyone who has one of these qualities have others of them as well, indeed all of them—all the ones that really do deserve to be counted as virtues? Even further, is there really no set of distinct and separate virtuous qualities at all, but at bottom only a single one—so that the person who has this single condition of “virtue” (and only he) is entitled also to the further descriptions “honest” and “well-controlled” and “just” and “friendly” and “courageous” and “fostering” and “supportive,” and so on, as distinguishable aspects or immediate effects of his unitary “virtue”?",

He will observe the condition of the mother during the period of gestation, and the influences by which she has been surrounded; and after the child is born, he will watch the treatment of the infant, and the gradual development of its instincts and powers, and the acquiring of names to things, which Hobbes considers to be the basis of the understanding. He will note how the child is trained to good or to evil how its passions are stimulated and directed; and will observe how it is excited to anger and vengeance, often at a very early period, and even against inanimate objects; and whether it be pampered and trained to vanity and pride, concealment, terror, superstition, selfishness, and falsehood; what it acquires by the force of example, and what is owing to its peculiar constitution; how evil circumstances will subdue a good tendency, and how a good natural disposition will triumph over evil influences.",

Reflections, echoes, doubles and souls do not belong to the domain of resemblance or equivalence; and it is no more possible to exchange one's soul than it is to substitute real twins for one another. If exchange is the criterion of generality, theft and gift are those of repetition. A reflection repeats what it reflects, but cannot replace what it reflects. Indeed, insofar as it inverts what it reflects, they are enantiomorphs that map on to their doubles without it being possible to substitute the one for the other.",

      "abstract": "The liberty of the individual must be thus far limited; he must not make himself a nuisance to other people. But if he refrains from molesting others in what concerns them, and merely acts according to his own inclination and judgement in things which concern himself, the same reasons which show that opinions should be free prove also that he should be allowed, without molestation, to carry his opinions into practice at his own cost. That mankind are not infallible; that their truths for the most part are only half-truths; that unity of opinion, unless resulting from the fullest and freest comparison of opposite opinions, is not desirable, and diversity not an evil but a good, until mankind are much more capable than at present of recognizing all sides of the truth, are principles applicable to men's modes of action not less than to their opinions. As it is useful that while mankind are imperfect there should be different opinions, so it is that there should be different experiments of living; that free scope should be given to varieties of characters, short of injury to others; and that the worth of different modes of life should be proved practically, when anyone thinks fit to try them. It is desirable, in short, that in things which do not primarily concern others, individuality should assert itself. Where, not the person's own character but the traditions or customs of other people are the rule of conduct, there is wanting one of the principal ingredients of human happiness and quite the chief ingredient of individual and social progress.",

      "abstract": "The relationship between the seeing of his own thoughts and the oculomotor function was studied in a schizophrenic who experienced the seeing of his own thoughts (Gedankensichtbarwemden). This patholgical experience was analysed in comparison with that in one case reported in Japan.1) The patient could actually see his own thoughts or images which occurred in his mind and could change the scene or the things seen in front of his eyes according to his own will. However, he could not recognize things seen as they existed in the real world, nor see highly abstract ideas such as philosophy, realism, etc.2) The experience of the seeing of his own thoughts was considered to be an eidetic image, but he did not appear to be a man with an eidetic disposition.3) Upward eye movements were observed concomitant with the seeing of his own thoughts. However, such eye movements did not occur at the time when he did not experience such visions. Duning close observation for over 2.5 years, there was an apparent relationship between the pathological experience of these visions and the eye movements.4) A large nystagmus to the left was apparent regardless of the absence or presence of the vision.5) The slow eye deviation in the OKP test was inhibited when he experienced the seeing of his own thoughts, but was normally produced when he did not have such experiences. Smooth pursuit in the eye tracking test and normal responses in the caloric test were obtained regardless.These findings suggest that the pathological experience of the seeing of his own thoughts is closely related to abnormal functions of the oculomotor system.",

It is thus notsurprising that the conceptualization of fear in the book of Deuteronomy is strongly linked to the activation and moral formation of both individual and community. On the one hand, and especially in the book’s eve-of-battle rhetoric, fear is something to be avoided and confined so that it does not contaminate the entire community (“fear not!”). On the other hand, whenits object is the nation’s deity, fear is something to be learned and taught (“so that they may learn to fear me… and teach theirchildren for ever”). In both capacities, fear in Deuteronomy has an extraordinary potential to shape the social order. It has akey role to play in stabilizing society and promoting both collective and individual flourishing, while also being understoodas a destabilizing, destructive force that is to be quarantined as if it were a contagious virus. </",

Research observation of people with dementia is that they have \"a rigid set of social standards\" or are not wanting to be touched.

It is at first easier to see the differences between the two types of play rather than their similarities. The Morality is not concerned with Bible history and is not cyclical in form. Nevertheless, both forms are unashamedly didactic drama and both are deeply concerned for the spiritual welfare of man. Because the Morality was not tied to the static theology of the scriptures which shaped the Mystery play, it is in many ways a more flexible dramatic form. The driving force behind any Morality play was to teach — but the personal views of the author (most usually an unknown writer) towards social, political, religious or moral matters were incorporated into a set of conventions which that writer in turn both inherited and expanded. For this reason there is no such thing as a 'typical' Morality play — a fact which is at the same time both exhilarating and exasperating.",

What is occluded, hidden, or forgotten in our ordinary lives is not some idea or value; it is this presence of the other's face to me – and my responsibility to and for this person. Moreover, this reality or event or encounter, which in a sense is beyond our thinking, our concepts, and our rules, and prior to them, is determinative and unconditional. It is all plea and command, made again and again, in episode after episode.

      "title": "Perfectionism, value pluralism, and the human good",
      "abstract": "What makes for a good life? If you have a child, a spouse, or a very close friend you probably want what is best for her. However, in order to know what would be best for your loved one you need an account of the personal good. I argue for a version of value pluralism, according to which there is disparate list of fundamental goods which resist reduction to some single supervalue such as pleasure and lack any strong unifying principle. I argue that any adequate account of the human good must include pleasure and freedom from pain, knowledge and understanding, practical rationality, and proper emotional responsiveness as fundamental goods, and that the only thing these various goods have in common is their intrinsic goodness. Value pluralism is an alternative to various kinds of monism about the good, such as hedonism, perfectionism, and the desire-satisfaction theory. Hedonism explains the value of any putative good in terms of pleasure, while perfectionism sees the good in terms of the development and exercise of those capacities or characteristics essential to some aspect of our nature. Desire- satisfaction views are best considered a form of monism about the good, since their identification of one's good with the satisfaction of one's desires offers a way of unifying various goods. The battle between monistic and pluralistic accounts is usefully analyzed in terms of competing theoretical virtues such as unity, simplicity, explanatory coherence, and plausibility. Monistic accounts typically score high along the first three of these dimensions and quite low along the last. I consider what I take to be the most promising versions of value monism, and argue that each scores so low along the dimension of plausibility that it should be rejected in favor of value pluralism. I begin by considering hedonism and the desire- satisfaction view and then discuss two distinct versions of perfectionism. Hedonism and perfectionism, in particular, are implausible because they fail to recognize our complex natures as embodied rational agents, and our need for a vision of the good which is correspondingly complex. In the final chapter I offer just such an account",

      "title": "&amp;quot;God Has No Allergies&amp;quot;: Immanent Ethics and the Simulacra of the Immune System",
      "abstract": "“God has No Allergies”: Immanent Ethics and the Simulacra of the Immune System Adrian Mackenzie “[T]he science of life always accommodates a philosophy of life.”1 Conventional approaches to bioethics long for a purified set of principles in order to guide the application of scientific knowledges of the body — the life sciences — to individual “cases.” In the realm of bioethics, the possibility that these knowledges might themselves constitute entities such as the individual, or the possibility that the individual body might itself be something other than the more or less governable a-historical object of technoscientific action, awakens a kind of horror autotoxicus. Nor do the prevalent modes of ethical discourse react kindly to the possibility that the “living” body of an individual is also a self, an actor within a complicated set of narratives, codes and apparatuses whose various registers — medical, economic, racial, sexual, religious, and so on — intersect. In short, conventional bioethical discourses refuse to acknowledge that, as Emmanual Levinas has written, “the body is a permanent contestation of the prerogative attributed to consciousness of ‘giving meaning’ to each thing; it lives as this contestation.”2 Traditional bioethics disappoints us insofar as it overlooks the ways the body contests the prerogatives of consciousness, contests reason and self-identity. Instead of opening onto the possibility of divergent ethea, bioethics’ universalizing adjudicative principles legitimate the biomedical normalization of differences by trying to deal only with the moral rights of the rational self and by leaving the differing character of embodiment — a most profound aspect of the ethical habitat — aside. In its separation of scientific theory and “ethical” practice, and in its unwillingness to transit any borders into the epistemological territory of science, conventional bioethics misapprehends the active and ambivalent role of technoscientific intervention, an intervention which both produces these crucial differences in embodiment and participates in their effacement. Traditional bioethics allergically responds to the ethical issue — the maintenance of ethos, of embodied differences, of the character and habits of individual bodies. Bios: nomó “Now it is over life, throughout its unfolding, that power establishes its dominion.”3 Foucault’s well-known description of a shift during the last two centuries from sovereign to disciplinary power or “bio-power” implies a displacement in the substance of ethics.4 In diverse discourses and domains, it becomes increasingly obvious that the presumed exclusion of ethics from the theoretical-pragmatic complex of science itself, from the very concrete operations and forces of technoscientific discourses engaging living bodies, significantly limits the relevance and effectiveness of the traditional notion of ethics.5 As Donna Haraway describes it, “the power of biomedical language . . . for shaping the unequal experience of sickness and death for millions is a social fact deriving from on-going heterogeneous social processes.” 6 The morality-displacing power of biomedical discourse and practice does not confine itself to sickness and death, but branches out into the normalization of whole populations. At many different scales and under different aspects — birth, death, sexual relations, work, fitness, stress, leisure, and so on — life is targeted by the vectors of biomedical intervention. Again, Foucault makes this point succinctly when he writes of the emergence of bio-power: “For the first time in history, no doubt, biological existence was reflected in political existence; the fact of living was no longer an inaccessible substrate that only emerged from time to time; amid the randomness of death and its fatality; part of it passed into knowledge’s field of control and power’s sphere of intervention.”7 The propagation of bio-power — designating “what brought life and its mechanisms into the realm of explicit calculation and made knowledge-power an agent of transformation of human life”8 — powerfully challenges any responsive ethics to address the realm of physiology and to reframe the ethical substance to include the embodiment of biomedical materiality. In other words, so-called “physiological” or “biological” questions increasingly raise ethical issues in ways that cannot be disentangled from the historical conditions of life as a locus of power relations or, conversely, solved through an a-historical ethico-moral calculus. Under the auspices of bio-power, biological knowledge increasingly presents itself as the ground of self-realization and governance...",

This lesson learned early cements a partnership between the I and its bodily functioning so that neither obtrudes itself on the other or dominates the partnership in an unwholesome way. Especially fortunate is the person who takes his ordinary bodily workings for granted, has confidence in their support, and so remains free to investigate the boundless opportunities in life. These considerations apply to any type of bodily working and so we may look at the question of sleep from this standpoint.",

      "abstract": "Abstract An asymmetry effect is known to exist in the estimation of interpersonal distance, depending on whether the point of reference for the estimation is the subject (‘How far are the others from you?’) or the others How far are you from the others?). It looks as though, through the effect of a self‐centring schema, subjects feel that others occupy their own space more than they occupy the space of others. A self‐centring schema has also been found in many other processes involving judgment or comparison of oneself and others. It is generally interpreted as a sign of the affirmation and defence of personal identity. The three experiments reported here attempt to relate the asymmetries in the distances perceived between persons represented on a map to the following three areas in which one's sense of personal or group identity is involved: (1) in the perception of one's own specificity with respect to others (or of the specificity of the group to which one belongs with respect to other groups) (experiment 1), (2) in one's ability to put oneself in the place of others (exocentrism) (experiment 2). and (3) in the individuation of oneself by others (experiment 3). The results of these three experiments lead us to believe that it is indeed the processes of identification and affirmation of personal and group identity ‐ along with the underlying categorization processes — that are the source of the asymmetries observed in interpersonal distance estimation. The consistency of the data obtained in different situations also validates the technique used for estimating interpersonal distance.",

      "abstract": "The word contemplation almost always immediately conjures up thoughts of great silences and vast open spaces, or of small, closed environments designed for intense, concentrated thought.The latter settings, often religious, barely furnished and dimly lit, are conducive to introspection and an opening of the soul to positive thoughts, pregnant with the desire for peace, and often goodness.Contemplative thought is tinged with a certain religiosity that is not necessarily linked to a specific religious denomination but rather to one's own \"inner self\", which may even be open to the possibility of encountering and discovering the \"other\" (not always with a small \"o\"): an encounter rich with novelty, when it comes to desires at least, and therefore just waiting to be discovered.But such discovery, to come about, practically always demands, as a necessary condition, a climate of humilitya state of being that is not always easy to achieve but that, over time, can be attained, providing one manages to avoid the affectation that is the opposite of the natural, lightly worn humility to which we aspire.Humility, like the contemplative state, is not something that can be improvised.Humility is a gift that life gives us: a gift to be sought, loved and protected.Contemplation is possible for those seeking spaces for their soul -those wanting to open up their mind and their heart.And for all this to be possible, a crucial factor is place, which is to be understood not only in a physical sense.Being \"in the right place\" means being in a conducive atmosphere, and this necessary condition can manifest itself at the most unexpected times: the language of the spirit comes not so much from that which surrounds us as from within.It may seem strange -and I am the first to admit thisthat during an illness, requiring a stay in hospital, the need for spaces, opportunities and resonances can, timidly but definitively, be satisfied.Musing to myself one day, during one of my frequent hospital stays, I was struck by the rather obvious thought that patients, being in a supine position, must inevitably \"look upwards\".Jesting aside, there can be no denying that for those who are in hospital, time becomes all important and assumes connotations that make it diametrically opposed to time as perceived \"by those who are healthy and free\".Time seems endless, especially at night.The long silent nights when sleep eludes us -and our surprisingly lucid mind wanders and will not be stilled -are filled with questions about what tomorrow will bring.In this undesired situation, with its unfamiliar environment and web of terms belonging to a language of technical jargon, we become gripped by a kind of confused",

      "title": "Artificially Natural: A Brief History of Modern Sport",
      "abstract": "Sport is designed, and in being designed, is artificial. Seeing sport in this way suggests that athlete's moving bodies are engaged in unnatural activity. If sport was a natural, rational practice, if it was not designed, planned and constructed in a particular way with particular ends, rugby players would be able to throw the ball forward to a member of their own team, and we would not need qualifications in advanced mathematics to determine a golf handicap, or to recalculate the length of an innings in one-day cricket that has been shortened by rain. To say that sport is designed is not to argue that sport developed with a plan and intended outcome, but merely to recognize that sport's artificiality is the characteristic that sets it apart from play; it is rule bound, controlled, organized, disciplined, and managed. It is also intensely historicized: around the world large numbers of people spend incalculable amounts of energy dealing with issues that are the product of historical awareness of sports. Records are kept, aesthetics are debated, and rivalries are played out across generations. Paradoxically, popular and scholarly historical understandings of sport tend to obscure its artificiality, in large part because sport is so important in the now: the challenge in thinking historically about sport design is to get beyond a sense that there has been an inexorable series of logical steps towards the present. This chapter places sport's artificiality in a historical context through a discussion of the design of sport's rules and organizations, its spaces and equipment, including athletes' bodies, and the long-standing inter-relationship between sport and various media formations.",

      "abstract": "One cannot perform an act that is morally right, wrong, or obligatory if one does not have appropriate control over that act; deontic acts presuppose control. This is, perhaps, most evident in the case of moral obligation. It is difficult to accept the verdict that Leno, though pinned to his seat, ought to have saved the child, or that the paraplegic ought to have walked across the lawn when 'ought' denotes moral obligation or requirement. Again, it is hard to see how Mitch did something that is morally wrong by failing to help the victim of the car crash when he could not have helped the victim. Or it is, minimally, puzzling to see how Zakir did moral wrong by stealing the loaf when he could not but have stolen it. One might, given apt circumstances, reasonably think that Zakir did something bad by stealing the loaf, but this judgment is consistent with Zakir's not having done wrong. Or, again, it is paradoxical to suppose that the mother's not spanking the child was morally right when she literally lacked the ability to spank her child. These enigmas are not merely pragmatic or do not simply have to do with substantive moral claims about what is fair but are conceptual; the verdict about the paraplegic, for instance, seems conceptually inconsistent. Such examples, and numerous others like them, motivate the view that one cannot do what is right, or wrong, or obligatory unless one has appropriate \"deontic-grounding control\" over what one does.",

      "abstract": "pelled to acknowledge a far greater uniformity of appreciation than we are apt to suppose from the frequent use of such phrases as that \" tastes are so various as to be beyond the influence of rational dis- cussion.\"It often happens that a man likes one thing before his attention is directed to another, just as he may relish one dish until he partakes of a better.Devise, however, something essentially good, some- thing which satisfies the common yearnings of civilized humanity, and it will as surely court universal appro- bation as the skill of the accomplished chef will elicit general commendation.No better illustration of popular misconception can here be adduced than that treated of in Chapter IV.A friend rejoicing in the glories of the imagination, or aiming at discovering artistic proficiency alone, triumphantly points to a ceiling embellished with sky, clouds, doves, and angels, and exultingly exclaims, \"Is not this fine !\" You cannot go into ecstasies over it ; you feel it ought not to be there.You essay your reasons ; he will not listen to reasons.He shrugs his shoulders, pities your want of appreciation, and cuts short all controversy by giving you to understand that disapproval is immaterial, because whether you like it or do not like it is entirely a question of \" taste.\"Such decoration is radically wrong, since a house being a purely artificial thing, and a roof an absolutely neces- sary thing, no attempt should be made to impart to the ceiling a semblance of intangibility, or to suggest ex- posure to the open air.The friend can assign no reason for his approval beyond the circumstance that he likes it, and when he tells you it is a matter of \"taste,\" he really means that the thing he admires suits his own predisposition.Now Taste, as contradistinguished from predilec- tion, is eminently a subject within the influence of rational discussion.It will not be long before prin- ciples are established in this as in every other science ; and if we deduce our rules from those ascertainable laws written upon the open volume of Nature before us, we shall have no difficulty in ascertaining what is best calculated to please the eye, gratify the mind, elevate the sentiments, and conduce to that general harmony which prevails in creation around us ; which the spirit of man so earnestly desires, but which the folly of man so materially impedes.But it is idle to expect any effectual progress in popular appreciation unless we bear in mind the dis- tinction already adverted to between rules and principles ; unless we treat the subject more as a matter of judgment than of mere sentiment ; unless attention be drawn to the why and wherefore of aesthetic proposi- tions.It would be difficult to name even any book which goes beyond telling us that we ought to admire this, that, or the other, without assigning any reason for doing so; or that we ought to adopt one thing and B 2 ment ; that the arch is supposed to have been unknown to them, and to have been introduced only after the Macedonian conquest, -although recent discoveries in Asia Minor somewhat militate against this hypo- thesis ; -that it forms a distinguishing feature in Eoman design ; that it is a vast improvement upon the rigid lines of their predecessors, and that it is an in- dispensable element in successful construction at the present day.After the transfer of the capital to Byzantium oriental extravagances became engrafted upon the grand simplicity of the Eoman style, and thence arose the Byzantine, a very good specimen of which, although somewhat fantastic, is afforded in the Cathedral of St. Mark's in Venice.The twelfth century witnessed the incipience of that most exquisite method known as the Gothic, with its pointed arch and steeple, its buttresses, its mullion windows, chamfered edges, foliations, delicate tracery, and exquisite elaborations.From its almost simul- taneous adoption by those nations which had taken part in the Crusades, the germs of this style are supposed to have been borrowed from the Saracens ; and certainly there is a striking resemblance in the shape of the arch, in the spires, and in other salient characteristics.In the South Kensington Museum is a photograph from an unfinished mausoleum to Ali Adil Shah, which bears a most remarkable similitude to that of a ruined abbey.",

Whether in the context of RHI or OBE, since the participant passively receives visuo-tactile stimulations, body image appears only with the sense of ownership (SoO), not with the sense of agency (the registration that we are the initiators of our actions; SoA)^6,7^. Insofar as self-consciousness as a body image is a unity acting in its environments, body image has to be investigated in the relationship between SoO and SoA^8,9^. It requires an experimental condition in which SoO and SoA can be independently separated in an active condition. However, no experimental condition that is opposite to RHI and OBE in which a subject can feel SoA but not SoO has been proposed to date^10^. Here, we show that a person loses SoO for his own hand that he can freely move by his own will when he sees himself in a lateral view through a head mounted display. It was previously thought that SoO can be represented by synchronous inter-modal stimulations^10^, and that SoO appears to be complemented by SoA11. Our findings show that SoO can be lost under a synchronous visuo-proprioceptive condition while SoA can be maintained. SoO and SoA are two aspects of body representation, and similar dissociations have been proposed in various contexts, such as body image and body schema^12,13^, and 'Acting I' and 'Mine'^14^. Our result suggests that the two-centric-self consisting of SoA and SoO can enhance dynamically robust self-consciousness.",

Such a multidimensional prototype system could be realized in a connectionist network embodied in a brain/body and embedded in a world. It would not require logical reasoning as such, but rather a form of skilled coping very different from anything else considered by ethical theory.

      "abstract": "\"Food pattern\" and \"diet\" sometimes are referred with the same meaning. \"Food pattern\" can be defined by a priori and a posteriori approaches and refers to the characterisation of foods and frequency of consumption within a population combining with various characteristics. \"Diet\" may be represented as an individual way of life and considers the food consumption and others like culture, history, society, economy, sustainability, culinary activities, conviviality, physical activity and rest. Mediterranean diet fits on these two concepts. The question is if we are measuring Mediterranean diet as a whole, or whether we are only measuring one of its parts, neglecting the rest of components. Can this compromise the way we monitor its adherence and evolution, with the possibility of losing the perception of certain aspects? How can we preserve and promote the concept if we do not monitor all the pieces of the puzzle?",

Because there is a complete conviction among some that the inner man (unseen) is responsible for sin -as in the case of righteousness- and it may also stem from it, since the fall into Original sin until today. If it is not directly by: heart, soul, spirit, mind with free will, then it will be through responsibility or tacit participation (by lack of prohibition or taming) for sinful behavior that may come from outside through the flesh and its senses (sight, hearing, etc.), because: The good man out of the good treasure of his heart brings forth good things, and an evil man out of the evil treasure brings forth evil things (Matt. 12:35). And this is done through the behavior of human satisfaction of needs (physical and spiritual), because the flesh lusts against the spirit, (Galatians 5:17). With taking into account all factors of the surrounding external environment -economic, social and cultural environment, etc- which is difficult to control. In confronting the believer's faith and religious convictions that affect his behavior. The study also assumes that satisfying the human needs of the believer -originally- is spiritual satisfaction and not physical, for it is written: But you are not in the flesh but in the spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you (Romans 8:9). But this also does not prevent from being the opposite to be the correct . not only because what is born of the flesh is a flesh -John 3: 6- but also because of the negligence and weakness of the spirit and his distance from God (and all inner man). This study is complementary and explanatory to previous studies by the researcher in the same field, which also means that this study does not agree with Abraham Maslow's hierarchy of needs (1943).Although spiritual human satisfaction is difficult to deal with quantitatively -because who can be filled and satisfied from God's love and mercy- the study assumes metaphorically to simplify the explanation: that the sum of the physical and spiritual needs of a person is (100%). (50%) for the flesh, (50%) for the spirit. And that the competition between them to achieve the maximum satisfaction (material or spiritual) -according to the nature of the formation of each one- will be at the expense of the other. But this level of equilibrium (50, 50) is rejected in the Holy Book (Deuteronomy 30: 19; Gal 5: 17; Revel 3: 15). So let us assume that the human spirit has reached a saturation level (90% spiritual satisfaction). And let us also borrow from the science of physics : “ The law of communicating vessels” to use it in: Analyzing human behavior of satisfaction. Therefore, according to this law : Thelevel (90 %) of spiritual satisfaction means that the spirit will lead the whole person (as one unit) -the whole flesh (and the senses, feelings) and the whole inner man (the heart, mind, etc.)- to be under his Control. At the same level -(90 %) approximately. The opposite is also correct. That is, when physical satisfaction reaches ( 90 %), the spirit and the whole inner man will weake and slip into materialistic and mundane -approximately- with the same rate (90 %). As so on, with all cases of human satisfaction -be it 70% or 60%- (spiritual or physical), which we will study to clarify and explain the subject of the study.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Aquinas asserts on many occasions that human actions are specified by their objects. Two meanings he gives to the term ‘object’ are particularly significant. On some occasions, he uses ‘object’ to mean a thing in so far as it possesses a formal quality by which it defines a related action, habit, or power. To illustrate, as the colour of something (not its smell or taste) defines sight, so distinctive differences in what is willed determines whether human actions are morally good, evil, or indifferent, and whether they belong to more particular moral species such as almsgiving or adultery. On other occasions, Aquinas has a second meaning for ‘object’, namely, a proximate end. In this case, when he says an object specifies, he means that a proximate end (such as ‘taking an innocent life’) determines a moral species (such as ‘murder’), and that no further end an agent may pursue (such as wealth) is necessary to make this determination.",

      "title": "Moral Traces and Relational Autonomy",
      "abstract": "One feature of James Childress's approach to ethics is the experience of \"moral traces\" that agents ought to feel in situations of conflict after they have overridden one strong value for the sake of another.1 This experience grasps at something intuitive about the moral life, that in situations of intense moral conflict when we are faced with a choice to act in a way that goes against a deeply held value, it is morally important that we feel and respond a certain way. At the most immediate level, this might entail privately mourning or grieving that we had to violate the value. Doing so would affirm that we care about the overridden value, and by acknowledging such a care we would feel that our moral integrity has been protected. But shouldn't the concept of moral traces entail more than a private process of grief? Shouldn't it have an effect on our relations with others? Moral traces ought to obligate us to act toward others in certain ways, and in that sense it is a concept quite distinct from the pangs of conscience we feel when we have behaved badly. At the very least, these traces ought to press us to offer an explanation or justification to others for why we acted against an important moral value, especially if those others were affected negatively by our action. In more extreme cases, we might even be compelled to make amends or offer reparations to the one or ones who were harmed by our action.2In this article I am interested in sorting through the ways that moral traces function in the moral life, especially in terms of the work they do in maintaining and building social and institutional relationships. I want to suggest that moral traces are more than an internal attitude that pertains to individual flourishing; they are also integral to communal well-being. By pointing to a contrast between moral traces as important for individual flourishing and moral traces as conducive to increased communal well-being, I also hope to expand our thinking about the liberal principle of autonomy that is central to Childress's approach. I am motivated in this article by a worry that some might use the appeal to moral traces to reinforce an individualistic, psychological notion of the self. This is clearly something that Childress does not do, as can be seen in his 1970 Soundings article, \"Who Shall Live When Not All Can Live?\" There he tethers the equitable distribution of scarce medical resources firmly to the maintenance of relationships of trust. In later writings, he explicitly outlines the obligations to others that emerge in situations when an important value has been overridden. Relationships of trust and the obligations to others incurred by moral traces both point to a conception of agency that is relational.In what follows, I hope to suggest the broad contours of an account of moral traces that highlights its relational features. Looking at moral traces through a relational lens accentuates, and perhaps even intensifies, the obligations that they incur. Put differently, relational conceptions of autonomy require a more careful account of moral traces—one that focuses on what we owe one another. By a relational conception of autonomy, I mean a view of agency that sees the choices we make as shaped by our relations with and commitment to others. Highlighting moral traces as central to the moral life is a way to recognize the importance of human accountability, which ensures that we are always fully aware of how our actions affect others. Ultimately, the significance of the effect of moral traces does not lie simply in protecting an agent's integrity or sense of herself as morally whole but rather in how it promotes the building and maintaining of relations.Annette Baier makes this point eloquently in her critique of Michael Stocker's account of moral guilt—a concept that, while not exactly synonymous with moral traces, does share a family resemblance. She notes that although Stocker is concerned about the effects of moral dilemmas, his \"attention is given to the emotions of choosers, not to the feelings of the victims or beneficiaries of their choices\" (1992, 363). At another point, Baier refers to the \"dirty hands\" metaphor as pushing us \"into a Lady Macbeth frame of mind, obsessed with our own stained character rather than what we have done to others and how that felt for them\" (363).3 It is precisely this sense of how those harmed by our actions might feel that makes moral traces such a central component of a relational account of morality. Baier writes, \"Without a moral psychology that puts informed empathy and willingness to listen to others' point of view squarely in the center of our moral-psychological capacities, without a social interactive account both of rationality and of morality, the constraints that moral psychology can put on what counts as 'a more acceptable version of ethics' will be merely formal and very limited\" (365).While Childress does not use the term moral traces in his early Soundings article, he does offer some brief thoughts that hint at its further development in later writings. His short mention of moral guilt in this article serves as an impetus for my reflections about how moral traces can serve a relationship-building or maintaining purpose. I begin by assessing what he says in the Soundings article, especially as it relates to the view of the theologian Helmut Thielicke, whom Childress discusses in this article. I then look to Childress's discussion of moral traces in later writings on war, bioethics, and public health. Finally, as a way to further examine the relational implications of the concept, I turn to two fairly recent concepts in the bioethics literature: moral distress in nursing ethics and \"the patient as victim and vector model\" in public health ethics. While certainly not identical to Childress's conception of moral traces, these concepts reinforce a similar sentiment about relationality and our obligations to others in difficult moral cases. They also help us see that moral traces are not only located in the individual conscience or in the moral universe more generally; their effects are also embodied in institutional procedures.4 This echoes Childress's sentiment in the 1970 Soundings article that one of the tasks of social ethics is \"to propose relatively just institutional arrangements within which self-interested and biased men can live\" (Childress 1970, 342).In the 1970 article \"Who Shall Live When Not All Can Live?,\" James Childress makes a passing reference to a concept that forms a connective tissue through the corpus of his work in areas as diverse as conscience, war, and bioethics. He suggests that the allocation of scarce lifesaving medical resources (SLMR) presents us with \"'borderline situations' which inevitably involve guilt\" (1970, 175). He borrows the phrase \"borderline situations\" from the German theologian Helmut Thielicke, who had only recently addressed the issue of allocation of scarce lifesaving resources at a symposium held in Texas. It is not fully clear in his brief discussion of Thielicke whether or not Childress believes that decisions about allocating scarce medical resources must involve guilt.5 He writes, \"Even if all actions in SLMR should involve guilt, some may preserve human dignity to a greater extent than others\" (347). What is clear, however, is that he distances himself from Thielicke's view that the best humans can do in the face of these borderline situations is \"to understand and endure—not 'solve'\" them. By contrast, Childress believes that one can make discriminating judgments using the tools of ethics so that even our choices about \"who shall live when not all can live\" are informed by the notion that some decisions may \"preserve human dignity to a greater extent than others.\" For him the preservation of human dignity is achieved through a careful evaluation of the factors and norms in a given situation. Thus, whereas for Thielicke, any ethical judgment in such situations is flawed, Childress holds more optimistically that reasoned ethical judgments are possible. For both of them, however, the agent's realization that she is affected in some way by such difficult moral choices is important to her human flourishing. What is unclear in this brief reference is the nature and extent of this effect on the moral agent. Does it morally obligate her to make some sort of amends, or does it simply do its work on a psychological level in terms of ensuring that the overridden principle does not lose its potency?Thielicke's ideas about moral guilt are both deeply existential and deeply theological. For Thielicke, the guilt that results from moral dilemmas is debilitating to the point that it leaves the Christian moral agent with very few viable options. Indeed, he does not see the task of evangelical theological ethics as providing easy answers or solutions to ethical problems.6 Roman Catholic casuistry and its legalistic and naturalistic theology falls prey to this temptation. He uses the term \"borderline situations\" (Grenzsituation) to depict what he calls \"abnormal cases,\" ones that involve \"transitions or complications\" (Thielicke 1966, 578).7 The prime example of such a situation for Christians, according to Thielicke, is when they must use the methods of their evil opponent, as in the case of the duty to fight oppressive tyrannical dictatorships. Thus the individual Christian, especially if he holds political responsibility, is \"ineluctably forced into a situation in which he must act within a framework of injustice\" (585). What such situations teach Christians is that the world is fallen: \"man has perverted his world, and no man is exempt from sharing responsibility for this human character of his world, this demonic humanizing of the world. No man is merely the object of a conflict situation. We are all part of the human subject that helped to bring it about\" (597). Thus what is communal about this guilt for Thielicke is that the difficult moral conflict serves to remind Christians of their ongoing guilt as children of Adam. The borderline situation has its \"origin in a communal guilt which already stands behind our situation and which we for our part ever increase and intensify…. We are both channels and perpetrators of cosmic guilt\" (602).Borderline questions, according to Thielicke, \"preclude the possibility of any final answers.\" He writes, \"The questions must remain open\" (1970, 147). The impossibility of any final answers to difficult moral dilemmas is firmly grounded in certain theological presuppositions, such as human sinfulness. Thielicke understands the human condition of sin as a usurpation of man's limits—a going beyond the limits to which humans are destined. Put differently, it is that man \"has placed himself in sinful contradiction to the destiny for which he was created\" (154). In essence, human creativity—the ability to transform nature into culture—is always tainted by humanity's inability to accept its destiny as God's creatures. Humans are always pressing the boundaries of their creatureliness. He contrasts the Christian view that identifies suffering with human guilt and responsibility to secular ideas that attribute life's tragedy to the structures of the world. He writes, \"In myth … this world which is no longer whole tends to be regarded as something given, an intact structure in which guilt and fate are inseparably interwoven. The Bible, on the contrary, looks instead at man. It sees not the structure, but this personal representative of our disjointed world\" (156).Human sinfulness is not manifested in particular actions. Rather it is the very structure of human existence that is the root of human guilt. In essence, for Thielicke, there is no possible choice that a human can make in the face of any moral decision that would relieve her of this existential guilt: \"It is a matter of being, not action\" (164). Yet there are certain types of situations in which human decisions and human actions can bring about greater guilt. Indeed it is the experience of guilt that is a measure of the person's moral health and well-being. Like a wound that cannot be allowed to heal, the guilt one feels when making difficult moral decisions such as allocating scarce medical resources is difficult. In contrast to the utilitarian who is able to make a decision with clear-cut objective criteria, the moral person must suffer the anguish of the \"impossibility of the task.\" Her suffering is felt in \"pangs of conscience\" that are \"a kind of gauze placed in the wound to prevent its healing in the wrong way.\" Continuing with the metaphor, he insists that while the wound must not be closed, it must not be allowed to infect the moral actor: \"The pus of the insoluble dilemma must have some way of escaping. Otherwise, the very humanity of the physician himself becomes infected; he succumbs to the illusion of the easy solution\" (173). Only by keeping the wound open does Thielicke believe that humans can arrive at an awareness of the very essence of what it is to be human.The most obvious contrast between Thielicke and Childress in the Soundings article is that Childress's view of human guilt is not explicitly connected to theological and existential ideas about the ongoing guilt of humans before God. Thielicke's view of cosmic guilt undermines his confidence that any method of deciding how to allocate scarce lifesaving devices can ever really be justifiable. He invokes casting lots, but unlike Childress, his endorsement of it is lukewarm at best. He sees it as an unsatisfactory option but perhaps the best one humans have available to them in such a situation.There are two points from the Soundings article that are relevant to my attempt to rethink the concept of moral traces. First, while Childress's view about guilt in \"borderline situations\" is not explicitly developed in the article, his engagement with Thielicke is illuminating because I believe it foreshadows his later emphasis on moral traces. Thielicke's insistence that the \"wound\" should not infect the actor supports my contention that moral traces ought to do more than simply affect the individual; they must incur some sense of obligation to others. Second, Childress bases his strong support of random selection on the belief that it is the best option for maintaining human dignity, equality, and trust. All three of these values are, in his view, important for building and maintaining relationships. Childress is explicit about this in several places in the article. Quoting Paul Ramsey, he describes equality of opportunity \"as the ethical substance of the relations of those individuals to one another\"(Childress 1970, 348). In another passage, he describes trust as \"an attitude of expectation about another,\" namely, the expectation that one will be treated with respect (349).When we turn to Childress's 1978 article on just war in Theological Studies, we begin to see the full development of the concept of moral traces. In this more extended discussion, he situates them within \"the logic of prima-facie duties.\" Relying on the moral philosopher W. D. Ross, he argues that prima facie obligations are more binding than relative principles that function like rules of thumb, and less binding than absolute principles that can never be overridden. Thus, a prima facie obligation is \"intrinsically binding, but it does not necessarily determine one's actual obligation\" (1978, 430). A central component of the logic of these conflicting obligations is that \"an overridden or outweighed prima-facie obligation continues to function in the situation and the course of action one adopts\" (431; emphasis mine). Childress explicitly uses the phrases \"moral traces\" and \"residual effects\" in this article to describe how the outweighed obligation \"continues to function.\"He also turns to A. C. Ewing, who specifies more clearly how the overridden obligation continues to have a hold on the moral agent. For Ewing this hold results in a \"mental attitude\" that evokes regret, but even more important, that ought to affect the agent's future actions. Ewing writes, \"My omission to fulfill my prima facie duty to him in this case will increase the force of any prima facie obligations I may have to him as regards future actions. And even if it did not affect overt action, the existence of a prima facie obligation not to do it should always affect our mental attitude towards an action.\" Ewing describes the mental attitude as \"a positive thing even if not translated into action\" and writes further that \"a good man will at least regret the violation of prima facie duties\" (1959, 110). In a footnote, Childress comments that for W. D. Ross, the appropriate response to an overridden obligation is not shame or repentance but rather compunction.Childress's views about the intensity of this mental attitude after a moral conflict are not fully developed in this discussion. Yet he manages to introduce a broad array of terms to describe it: residual effects, regret, shame, repentance, compunction. He seems to favor the terms—traces and residue—that suggest a less intense effect on the moral agent. Elsewhere in the article, he claims more directly that guilt is not the appropriate emotional attitude in such cases. He supports, without fully developing, a notion of \"creative regret\" that he borrows from Albert R. Di Ianni (Childress 1978, 433). However, in discussing the jus ad bellum criterion of \"right intention\" as the maintenance of proper motives, he states \"an attitude of regret, if not remorse, is appropriate when a prima-facie obligation is overridden\" (438). Such a clear statement equating moral traces with regret is not typical of his discussions in later work, such as Principles of Bioethics (PBE).Nevertheless, in his view, overriding a principle does lead to specific obligations. These are most explicit in his discussion of the jus in bello criteria—the criteria that govern how to conduct war. His primary point is that even though a just war requires one to overrule the prima facie obligation not to injure or kill another, the hold that the obligation has on the moral agent is not \"overruled.\" In other words, the agent still must discharge some obligations to the other—and these obligations require that (1) the immediate object of war is not to kill or even injure, (2) one ought not directly target noncombatants, (3) one cannot impose \"unnecessary suffering,\" and (4) any effect (even if only indirect) of war on civilians \"must be justified by the principle of proportion\" (441). By connecting moral traces to the jus in bello criteria, Childress reinforces a notion that these traces are more than just an internal wound or disposition, and instead constitute an attitude that necessarily entails an obligation to minimize the harms caused by overriding a prima facie duty.When we turn our attention to Childress's later work, especially in PBE, we see that moral traces play a significant role in two ways: to remind the agent that prima facie duties are not neutral values and to highlight the centrality of conscience and integrity as virtues in the practice of medicine. The account of the logic of prima facie duties in PBE follows quite closely the account presented in the earlier just-war article. For example, Childress and his coauthor, Tom Beauchamp, argue that when overriding a prima facie obligation, there will always be traces of \"regret and a sense of moral residue.\" They write, \"Moral residue results because an overridden prima facie obligation does not simply go away when overridden\" (Beauchamp and Childress 2009, 19). While overlapping in some ways with their discussion of conscience, the two concepts remain distinct. Childress describes conscience as \"an internal sanction that comes into play through critical reflection.\" While this sanction may have different forms, he notes that it \"often appears as a bad conscience—in the form of feelings of remorse, guilt, shame, disunity, or disharmony—as the individual recognizes his or her acts as wrong\" (44). The sanction of a bad conscience is different from the feeling of moral traces, because with the former, the agent feels that the act she performed is wrong. Moral traces, by contrast, imply that one has \"residual obligations\" or that one needs to at least acknowledge internally that an important obligation or value has been sacrificed, but not that the act itself is wrong. Nevertheless, moral traces share with the conscience the ability to help repair any disunity or disharmony that the agent may have experienced in the context of the difficult dilemma.One final example of the role of moral traces in Childress's work comes from his writings on the moral foundations of public health. Along with several colleagues, he has suggested that public health officials must satisfy five justificatory conditions when choosing to override individual liberty or justice. These are effectiveness, proportionality, necessity, least infringement, and public justification. It is the last of these that I think illustrates most clearly the connection between moral traces and obligations. In particular, the public health setting provides an example of institutional obligations that result from acknowledging that an important value has been overridden. The responsibility that public officials have in this regard is \"to explain and justify that infringement, whenever possible, to the relevant parties, including those affected by the infringement.\" They must offer moral reasons because they are required to \"treat citizens as equals\" (Childress et al. 2002, 173). This activity of accountability to the public is, in Childress's words, \"indispensable for engendering and sustaining public trust, as well as for expressing justice.\" It involves actively seeking ways to engage the public with the decisions being made on its behalf. This engagement involves seeking out the public's input, maintaining transparency about the process, and providing relevant information to the public. Although Childress and his coauthors do not use the language of moral traces in this discussion of public justification, their appeal to the obligations that public authorities have when they have infringed upon or overridden important moral values is a by-product of the traces. Childress's emphasis on ongoing obligations illustrates his belief that difficult moral decisions do not come to an abrupt end; they do not disappear. Rather, responsible moral agents ought to continue to act and feel in ways that acknowledge the ongoing implications of these decisions.What can we conclude about Childress's view of moral traces from this quick summary of his work? First, it seems clear that he does not see moral traces as identical to moral regret. Individuals can experience moral traces while being sure that they made the right decision in difficult moral situation. In other words, they are not wishing that they had done something else.8 Rather, they are taking the implications of what they did seriously. Second, his view of moral traces as incurring ongoing obligations supports an account of agency that is relational. This conclusion runs counter to prevailing critiques of Childress's \"principlism\" that depict it as grounded in a conception of the agent as an isolated, atomistic individual.Accounts of personhood as relational have become fairly commonplace in normative ethical discussions, especially ones that are informed by feminist, virtue, narrative, or communitarian visions. The \"relational self\" is usually posited over against the individualistic moral agent believed to be prevalent in certain liberal philosophical approaches. This individualistic vision of autonomy is also commonly associated with bioethics discourse, especially with Childress's approach.9 Critics of autonomy worry about the tendency to see the self as independent and separate from the discursive contexts that shape our commitments and values. They think a more accurate description of moral agency is one of responsiveness to the particularities of situations and to the network of dependencies that enable individuals to flourish. While the emphasis on particularity and dependency has been appealing to many feminist theorists, some have rejected a wholesale abandonment of autonomy as potentially antithetical to feminist political goals. They are skeptical of views that mistakenly stereotype individual autonomy as fundamentally individualistic and rationalistic. Thus they want to salvage autonomy because of the central role they believe it plays in feminist analyses of oppression, subjection, and agency. The model of relational autonomy has emerged as a useful hybrid that takes the concerns raised by critics of autonomy seriously without abandoning the important function of respect for the dignity of the individual.10The principle of autonomy is clearly central to Childress's ethics. Even in the Soundings article, we can see that he supports random selection for the allocation of scarce medical resources because it preserves respect for dignity and autonomy. Yet it is important to note that for Childress this respect for autonomy does not preclude attention to relationships. Indeed, it is intimately tied to the attitudes of trust necessary for society to function. Trust provides us with one example of a deeply relational concept that is intimately tied to respect for autonomy, insofar as it reflects our ultimate respect for the other's dignity and humanity. Childress's emphasis on moral traces and the obligations they produce also supports a concept of autonomy that is attentive to human relationships. While Childress avoids pressing moral traces and regret into the stronger realms of remorse or guilt, his emphasis on residual obligations in the contexts of war, bioethics, and public health suggests that the effects of moral traces extend beyond individual conscience. They require the moral agent to attend to the impact of her act on human relationships, both private and public. This suggests that for Childress, no moral decision exists in an isolated vacuum. We cannot thus speak of individual autonomy apart from the broader social contexts that all humans inhabit. As Courtney Campbell reminds us, certain elements of Childress's theology—namely, his claims about humans created in God's image—provide the basis for a view of autonomy that goes against certain secular notions of autonomy that privilege individualism and self-determination. Childress's theologically informed view of autonomy, according to Campbell, \"must be qualified by considerations of dependence, sociality, and finitude\" (Campbell 1989).Moral traces result when one voluntarily makes a choice to act in a certain way, but recognizes that in one's doing so, an important moral principle or value is threatened or even sacrificed. But what about cases in which the choice to act is not completely voluntary, when the agent is constrained by institutional pressures? These cases are captured by the terms moral distress and moral residue—terms that have come to be associated primarily with nursing ethics. The discussion of these terms is not always very precise in the literature, where we often see the terms conflated. It is useful, however, to get a sense of how these concepts work and to ask whether they offer any useful insights for thinking about the relational component of moral traces.The appeal to the language of moral distress and moral residue in nursing ethics refers to a much more intense sentiment than Childress's appeal to moral traces. Indeed, at times it sounds like a radically different phenomenon—something that results from forced violations of moral values, rather than from genuinely dilemmatic situations. In that sense, it is more like situations that involve violations of conscience and integrity. Recall that in PBE, Beauchamp and Childress distinguish moral traces from conscience. Nevertheless, discussions of moral distress can show us how internal reflections about our moral choices can and should have an effect on our obligations to others. More particularly, they draw attention to the implications of moral traces on institutional structures and procedures.Jameton's pioneering article on the issue of moral distress in nursing makes an important distinction between moral dilemmas (which Childress believes gives rise to moral traces) and moral distress. Moral dilemmas occur when \"it is clear to the nurse that different and important values conflict, but no choice presents itself that preserves both\" (Jameton 1993, 542). In contrast, distress is what occurs when a moral agent is unable to act on a judgment as a result of institutional or professional constraints. For Jameton, moral dilemmas present interesting material for students of philosophy to ponder, but in reality, they are rare and, in his words, \"are bad news and to be avoided\" (543). By dismissing moral dilemmas as rare occurrences, Jameton pays little attention to the experiences of moral regret or guilt. He worries, however, that nurses often conflate or confuse dilemmas (in the philosophical sense) with the experience of moral distress. In other words, when asked to describe their experiences, nurses often characterize the distress they feel at not being able to act on their judgments as dilemmatic. Although he acknowledges that distress can and often does give rise to \"second-order\" moral dilemmas, it is a mistake to view situations when one's choices are constrained institutionally as dilemmatic. To do so leads nurses to unnecessarily blame themselves for situations over which they have little control. I think Jameton's point is pertinent because I take him to be saying that when nurses view their actions as resulting from genuine dilemmas instead of from unjust institutional structures, they will experience the wrong kind of guilt. What really matters for nurses is that institutions treat them justly by allowing them opportunities to participate fully in the decision-making process. Jameton is worried about the conflation of dilemmatic situations and situations of moral distress because of its implications for moral responsibility. The importance of the category of \"moral distress\" is that it draws attention to how nurses are often forced to act in ways that violate their deeply held beliefs and commitments. This violation leads to a significant moral crisis that can potentially paralyze the agent. In other words, unlike moral traces, moral distress does little for relationship and community building. Indeed, it leads to disintegration. The \"distressed\" nurse is isolated and finds herself alienated from her institutional and professional role. In the end, while the literature on moral distress often seems to be referring to something different from moral traces in the sense that Childress uses the term, it can offer us some useful insight about relationship/community building in the aftermath of difficult moral problems. In particular, it helps us to think about how moral traces in Childress's sense ought to lead to just social and institutional arrangements.Margaret Battin's recent contribution to public health ethics offers us more resources for thinking about moral traces and their relational features. She intends her work as an intervention in bioethics and public health ethics—one that attempts to undermine the notion of the self that underlies these approaches. Her approach is animated by several concerns. One has to do with a failure of bioethics to account for infectious disease as a defining feature of human experience. For Battin, this seemingly minor oversight overlooks something very important about our nature as human animals. She writes, \"Infectiousness is an especially direct reminder of how misleading the paradigms of individualism can be\" (Battin et al. 2009, 78). Battin's overarching goal, however, is to develop a more sensitive account of public health ethics. While she does not explicitly address the ideas of regret, remorse, or conscience, I believe her reminder about our biological reality as deeply interconnected creatures serves as a useful impetus for thinking about the implications of relational autonomy.Battin describes the self as a \"way-station,\" and \"embedded\" self, a vision of subjectivity that resonates with many feminist critiques of autonomy.11 Battin's important insight is that to speak of persons as shaped and constituted by and through their webs of relations is to speak about something physical and biological. She visualizes, rather than a romantic vision of relationality as constituted merely by friendship and familial relations, the individual as a \"launching pad and breeding ground for trillions of organisms that move from one human being to another, either directly or by way of intermediate vectors\" (462). This biological view expands the feminist account of relational autonomy. She writes, \"Attention to social locatedness is not enough. Physical locatedness … is critical as well\" (78).While clinical medicine has tended to see the patient primarily as a victim, public health has seen the patient primarily as a vector. Battin urges public health and bioethics to view patients as both simultaneously, \"an account in which the patient can be seen as both victim and vector at the same time, a person simultaneously occupying both morally relevant roles\" (87). Another way to put this is that we need to think of ourselves not only in terms of the threats to us but also in terms of the threats we potentially pose to others. This, according to Battin, draws a more nuanced and complex picture of moral agency. In particular it complicates notions of responsibility and blame that posit that we can always know who is to blame and for what. The biological view of ourselves as victims and vectors of infectious disease acknowledges that we cannot always know with certainty who is to blame (who harms and who is harmed).This view of the self provides an interesting grounding to the notion of moral traces as a relational concept. Agents in a dilemmatic situation are never fully relieved of the traces of guilt or sorrow for what they have done, and that is a good thing. It serves as a reminder of our shared vulnerability and woundedness as human subjects. In other words, our actions have effects and the virtuous agent is sensitive to these effects. In the image of Battin's way-station self we see how we are all biologically connected in pathways of disease. In a similar way moral traces remind us of our roles as both subjects and objects.We can see the implications of Battin's metaphysical view in her treatment of the ethics of distribution of scarce medical resources in cases of pandemic emergencies. She concurs with the pandemic triage plans put forth by Canada, Tennessee, and Utah that all base their allocation decisions on \"medical criteria of survivability and need\" (397). However, she notes that the patient as victim and vector (PVV) perspective draws our attention to two additional points. First, these plans fail to give an adequate account of what kind of care those who are \"deprioritized\" receive, and second, existing injustices in health care are exacerbated by these allocation criteria. Consequently, Battin argues that the plans must be clear about the obligation they have to care for those who will not be first in the queue to receive care in such an emergency. The issue of injustice only makes clear that we have an obligation to attend to health care inequities before such emergency situations strike. These conclusions illustrate the importance of the residual obligations incurred in situations of moral conflict. Like Childress's views about the necessity of the jus in bello criteria, and about the importance of public justifications in public health, Battin affirms that overriding a principle leaves traces that are not only wounding to the moral agent but also damaging to the relationships of trust that enable communities to exist and flourish.Without a strong sense of moral traces or even moral regret, we are left with a view of an agent who is not fully accountable to others—who can override important moral norms without having to incur any costs. Moral traces acknowledge the vulnerability and limits of our humanity. Yet it would be a mistake to stop there by allowing such an acknowledgment to turn us inward by focusing exclusively on whether our integrity has been damaged. Moral traces ought to do more than just make us feel bad. They are the impetus for broadcasting our accountability to others by offering reasons for our actions. In the case of the allocation of scarce medical resources, that accountability is necessary for extending and maintaining trust between health care providers and patients. Childress argues that randomness and chance are \"most in accord with this relationship of trust\" (1970, 349). Decisions about who should receive lifesaving treatments based on social worth are not attentive to the long-term effects of our actions on the fundamental relationships that form the basis of our society.",

      "abstract": "God is the supreme Mystery of existence, He is by His own power above existence. God is the tripersonal super-essence of spiritual nature, above all spirituality that we may understand or imagine. He is the one Who brings everything into existence and that is why there is a fundamental difference between God and creation; the origin and the existence of the creation depend on the will and the creative work of God. As personal super-essence and super- existence, God is completely free because He cannot be closed into a reference system; He is the ultimate instance of all His decisions and acts. Man, created in the image of God reflects at the level of creation the freedom of God. As created existence, he is part of a reference system of the created world, which depends on God in its existence and becoming. As personal existence, in the image of God, the human person is capable of an existence that is not entirely enclosed into the reference system of the created nature; he is called to the free communion with God and it is the ultimate instance that decides his thoughts, acts and words. Man guards and increases his freedom or loses it according to the manner in which he professes it. For within the freedom of man the possibility to state the freedom is involved, at the same time renouncing it. The paradox of the freedom of man consists of the fact that man gives up his freedom through his own freedom because of pride or because he leaves the communion with God, Who offers him the true freedom.",

      "abstract": "We are held responsible for our deeds – even if we did not act according to our will. From a third-person perspective, to be deemed ‘mad’ is to be held not responsible for one’s actions. From a first-person perspective, to be mad is to feel that one’s deeds are not one’s own, thus not responsible for them – or vice versa to feel responsible for deeds that are not one’s own. The vulnerability to madness, the cypher of condicio humana, imbues responsibility: loss of responsibility (alienation) and excess of responsibility (guilt) are the extreme polarities of the dialectics of answerability in human existence. To be human is to be at odds with responsibility, that is, with the involuntary dimension of our being. Responsibility is at the same time a presupposition and a task since society expects a person to feel responsible for her deeds; yet responsibility is not an a priori, rather an achievement to be obtained through education. As Ricouer puts it: ‘Education is education to responsibility’. It is very difficult to disentangle responsibility from non-responsibility and standard assessment procedures are not always helpful for this. Taking the literary case of Musil’s serial murderer Moosbrugger, I sketch an alternative view based on the reconstruction of the life-world in which a given action takes place – rather than on the assessment of isolated symptoms. ‘To the judge –Musil writes – Moosbrugger was a universe, and it was very hard to say something convincing about a universe”. The judicial assessment of accountability is an ‘anaemic concept‘ if it does not takes into account the person‘s ‘universe’, that is, the ontological framework in which she is posited.",

Power-Words have power beyond the ordinary speech of communicating ideas. It is direct and does not need meditation. The study found that Power-Words are said to have inherent power to deal with all realms of life. They are used in the animistic worldview for protection, provision and treatment against the exigencies of life experienced in the physical and spiritual world. In the use of Power-Words, the findings observed that a careful application of Power-Words is needed so as to avoid a syncretistic attitude that enters the biblical worldview from an animistic worldview which presupposes the sovereignty of man where he plans what is desirable for oneself in his environment. Man becomes God for himself or becomes co-equal with God, which is a humanistic attitude of trying to achieve one's own desired goals. This is a false authority in handling and working out one's own destiny. This piece of work concludes that God cannot be manipulated in any form or any means. God will not share his glory with man; hence Power-Words used by man without acknowledging the sovereignty of God are contrary to the character and nature of God.",

      "title": "Lost in the Socially Extended Mind",
      "abstract": "Much of the characteristic symptomatology of schizophrenia can be understood as resulting from a pervasive sense of disembodiment. The body is experienced as an external machine that needs to be controlled with explicit intentional commands, which in turn leads to severe difficulties in interacting with the world in a fluid and intuitive manner. In consequence, there is a characteristic dissociality: others become problems to be solved by intellectual effort and no longer present opportunities for spontaneous interpersonal alignment. This leads to a loss of the socially extended mind, which normally affords opportunities for co-regulation of cognitive and affective processes. However, at times people with schizophrenia report that they experience the opposite of dissociality, namely, an unusual fluidity of the self-other boundary as expressed in experiences of ambiguous body boundaries, intrusions, and even merging with others. Here, the person has not lost access to the socially extended mind but has instead become lost in it, possibly due to a weakened sense of self. We argue that this neglected aspect of schizophrenic social dysfunction can be usefully approached via the concept of genuine intersubjectivity: we normally participate in a shared experience with another person by implicitly co-regulating how our interaction unfolds. This integrates our respective experiences' dynamical bases and gives the interaction an ambiguous second-person character. The upshot is that reports of abnormal self-other fluidity are not indicative of hallucinations without any basis in reality, but of a heightened sensitivity and vulnerability to processes of interpersonal alignment and mutual incorporation that form the normal basis of social life. We conclude by discussing implications of this view for both the science of consciousness as well as approaches to intervention and therapy.",

In close relationships, we voluntarily make ourselves most vulnerable to another human being by linking the realization of our needs, aspirations, and hopes to the goodwill of our relationship partner (for related ideas, see chap. 17, this volume). Rendering ourselves vulnerable makes possible the profound sense of well-being that can be experienced in close relationships. But at the same time, the imperfection of any partner means that hurt or injury is virtually inevitable, and when it occurs, the hurt is particularly poignant precisely because we have made ourselves vulnerable.

      "title": "A CLINICAL STUDY OF GILLES DE LA TOURETTE'S DISEASE (MALADIE DES TICS) IN CHILDREN",
      "abstract": "In his search of the literature for cases of a similar nature, Gilles de la Tourette was much impressed by reports of analogous syndromes in other cultures: \"latah,\" \"myriachit\" and \"jumping\"(13). \"The term latah conveys to the Malays a curious behavioral quirk, or aberration, normal, and yet not quite so.\"(14). The latah reaction consists of a severe startle reaction, imitative behavior, automatic obedience, and coprolalia. The victim is compelled \"against his will\"(15) to imitate the speech and behavior of others and to obey their commands, even though his tormentors clearly intend to degrade and ridicule him. He may even injure himself in the compulsion to mimic a self-destructive gesture only partially demonstrated by the person who \"teases\" him. For example, if the tormentor makes a sudden movement as if to place his hand in a fire, the latah victim may burn his own hand(16). \"Myriachit\" is the transliteration of a Russian word for an identical syndrome, one of a group classified as \"arctic hysteria\"(14, 16). The \"Jumpers\" of Maine, also known as \"Shakers\" or \"Barkers,\" were members of a deviant Methodist sect who practiced celibacy and communal living after their migration to New England(14). Church ceremonials reached a climax of religious ecstasy at which the members of the congregation would jump, shake, roll on the floor, or crawl about on all fours, all the while barking and emitting incoherent sounds (speaking in tongues). Those who participated in these ceremonials became prey to this behavior outside the church services. Members of this sect, examined by Beard in 1880(17), exhibited violent jumping and twisting movements when startled, echolalia, and echokinesis. Beard stated: \"All the Jumpers agree that it tires them to be jumped and they dread it, but they were constantly annoyed by their companions.\" It has been traditional in much of the medical literature to treat maladie des tics as though it were identical with latah and its cognate disorders. This is almost certainly incorrect. Tics, the earliest and often the most striking manifestations of Gilles de la Tourette's disease, are unknown in latah, whereas the imitation phenomena, which are the core of latah reactions, are often totally lacking in maladie des tics. The coprolalia in latah always follows provocation and is never perseverative. Latah reactions (with the significant exception of \"jumping\") are far more common in females, maladie des tics in males. Latah is never seen earlier than late adolescence. Sudden fright is consistently cited as its precipitating cause; startle reactions are prominent. When Aberle brought 3 persons familiar with latah reactions to see case #1 of this paper, they were unanimous in concluding that maladie des tics was clearly not the same as latah(16). Yap has suggested that latah reactions are a variant of traumatic or fear neurosis to be found in cultures with limited control over the physical environment(14). The etiology of Gilles de la Tourette's disease(2, 18-20) remains as obscure as it was in his time, though we may dismiss the notion of degeneracy, the catchall so fashionable in his day(1). Tics may be found in post-encephalitic conditions(21). They may accompany chorea, which may or may not be rheumatic in origin(22). They may be the symbolic crystallization of psychologic disturbances(23). Even when psychogenically induced, they may prove extremely refractory to psychotherapy(24, 25). Contrariwise, the organically grounded tic may be diminished, if not obliterated, by reduction in emotional tension. Consequently, arguments that reason from clinical phenomenology to hypotheses of origin must inevitably be inconclusive. The clinical manifestations of maladie des tics are responsive to the social environment, as our cases demonstrate; yet this in no sense constitutes proof of psychogenesis. An organic substratum may be nonetheless subject to modification or control by psychologic influences, since mental phenomena are brain events with electrical fields(26). In this connection, it is instructive to recall Efron's demonstration, in a patient with uncinate fits, that the mere recollection of odors and a conditioned visual image sufficed to inhibit the fits(27). In our experience, pharmacologic therapy, including sedatives, muscle relaxants, and tranquilizers, has been ineffective. At this stage of our knowledge, it would appear justified to continue efforts at psychotherapeutic management, despite Heuscher's admonition that the tic phenomena are defenses against an impending psychosis(20), and Mahler and Luke's warning that the release of aggressive and erotic material may \"weaken the controlling powers of the child ticquer\"(10). Very few of the cases reported in the literature have had a thorough trial of intensive psychologic treatment, still fewer in the early course of their disorder. At the least, psychotherapy may be of assistance to child and family in dealing with the social consequences of the illness. More hopefully, it may succeed in modifying the intrapsychic tensions that aggravate, if they do not cause, the symptoms. Several of our patients gave evidence of symptomatic improvement associated with psychologic treatment. The one patient with an apparently total recovery had the benefit of capably administered psychotherapy at two important junctures in his life. He had parents who, after psychiatric guidance, devoted their total efforts to his recovery. They were inclined to ascribe great value to home management with its concomitant descrease in social stimulation to the patient. It is not possible to say whether these factors or still other influences were instrumental in his recovery. Nonetheless, his gratifying response supports the wisdom of attempting total psychiatric management for patients with Gilles de la Tourette's disease.",

In the case of spiritual entities just because they are so one and indivisible we endeavour all the more to divide them in a feeble effort to get some understanding of what must ultimately remain mysterious.

      "abstract": "Blake critics most often see The Book of Thel as a thwarted attempt to pass from the state of Innocence to Experience. Blake’s heroine is usually perceived as a somewhat naive, indecisive young female afraid to “be born” into the world of adulthood and maturity, or as a soul that refuses to enter the material world. Hence, there has been a tendency to pass judgment on Thel’s decision, to attribute it to weakness, immaturity, or fear, and to see it in pejorative terms. My claim is that Thel’s refusal to enter the world of Generation has nothing to do with relapsing into childhood, or with weakness and indecisiveness. Instead, I see it as proof of her maturity and independent spirit. My article is concerned with two problems. Firstly, I want to demonstrate how text and design in The Book of Thel enter a mutual semantic relationship of contradiction and/or redundancy rather than complementarity. Naturally, this claim is not new; W. J. T. Mitchell recognized this quality as early as 1978, writing that “the ‘unity’ of an illuminated book is a dynamic one, built upon the interaction of text and design as independent or contrary elements” (xviii). What I would like to examine, however, is how this dynamic interaction reinforces a feminist reading of Blake’s text. Secondly, although there are critical texts that deal with Blake’s attitude to women, the majority of Blake scholarship on The Book of Thel does not seem sufficiently feminist. While he did not manifest an unwaveringly feminist stance throughout his poetry, in texts such as Thel or Visions of the Daughters of Albion he dealt with women’s issues in a way that may be deemed progressive. Consequently, I intend to focus on the problems of motherhood and childcare as rendered by Blake in his poem, since I perceive these notions to be essential for our understanding of Thel’s decision. Also, part of my argument is that, contrary to a number of critical readings, the message delivered by Thel’s three interlocutors (the Lilly, the Cloud, and the Clod of Clay) should not be seen as a positive statement that Blake wanted Thel to accept. Finally, if we comprehend Thel’s dilemma—whether to become a mother—this can shed light on some actions taken by other female characters in Blake’s later texts, Oothoon and Enitharmon in particular.",

      "abstract": "The word dhamma/dharma, whose root “dhr” means “to bind,” “to keep,” or “to maintain,” refers to a rather broad range of entities and relations. In fact, it seems to have the broadest field of semantic reference of any word in Pali (dhamma) or Sanskrit (dharma). On the one hand, dhamma is used to refer to both objects and their parts or elements (i.e., physical objects in the world around us). It also may refer to relations among objects, or more generally to any object of reference in thought or speech – in the same way that “thing” is used in ordinary English. On the other hand, dhamma may be understood to include “social morality” or the “moral law” as that which holds or binds people together. In this sense, dhamma refers to the underlying pattern or order of the cosmos and also to the pattern and order realized in the social and ethical rules and laws of human beings. Understood in this way, dhamma includes the ideas of virtue, duty, or proper moral and ethical conduct. Finally, as a technical term, Dhamma also means the specific teachings of the Buddha. As such, Buddhism is concerned with experiencing, discovering, understanding, practicing, and realizing the Dhamma.",

      "title": "Psychiatry and torture.",
      "abstract": "I would like to add to Julio Arboleda- Florez's excellent discussion of the problem of psychiatric participation in interrogations. There is considerable international support for asking psychiatrists and other physicians not only to decline to participate in torture and related practices, but also to speak out vigorously against its use by governments.\r\n\r\nWhile medical ethics surely disapproves such practices, they are also widely condemned in other quarters. For example, in its aspirational of Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment, the United Nations General Assembly, after asserting that no person under any form of detention or imprisonment shall be subject to torture or to cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment, adds in a note: The term 'cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment' should be interpreted so as to extend the widest possible protection against abuses, whether physical or mental, including the holding of a detained or imprisoned person in conditions which deprive him, temporarily or permanently, of the use of any of his natural senses, such as sight or hearing, or of his awareness of place and the passing of time (1).\r\n\r\nIn addition, the Body of Principles requires that no detained person while being interrogated shall be subject to violence, threats or methods of interrogation which impair his capacity of decision or his judgement (1).\r\n\r\nPsychiatrists are in a unique position to understand and communicate the importance of these principles and should denounce torture strongly in every possible venue. As Sagan and Jonsen (2) observed, because the medical skills used for healing can be maliciously perverted with devastating effects on the spirit and the body, it is incumbent upon the medical profession and upon all of its practitioners to protest in effective ways against torture as an instrument of political control. This is even more urgently true today than when it was written thirty years ago.",

      "abstract": "Irrational processes play an important, but often unacknowledged, role in man‐environment interactions. The fixed beliefs, intense emotions and pervasive defensiveness that constitute human irrationality are hardly amenable to logic, common sense and intellectual debate. A different set of skills are needed, quite unlike those of use in dealing with the more impersonal world. The incidence of such skills appears to be quite low due, it seems, to the combined effects of personal dispositions to avoid the irrational and inappropriate forms of education. This deficiency is not unique to the environmental disciplines but unfortunate in light of their claims to a broad perspective. It is argued that professional competence in the environmental area requires some capability in dealing with both natural and human irrationality. If this is to be achieved, a different emphasis is needed in environmental education, one that involves a concern for “process,” both intellectual and irrational.",

      "abstract": "Participatory art is characterized by a certain openness, inviting members of the audience to fill in the gaps of a work of art that is initiated by one or more visual artists. Processes of interaction, collaboration, and co-production are at the heart of this type of art practice, which started to flourish for the first time—at least in the western world—in the so-called long sixties (starting in the late 1950s and ending in the early 1970s). These temporary processes do not necessarily bring about tangible end products that can or should be preserved for the future. Participatory art projects tend to be focused on the here-and-now and the generated results are mostly characterized by mutability, multiplicity and ephemerality. To a certain extent, one needs to accept that these so-called ‘participatairy’ artworks—i.e. works that are both participatory and airy (or ephemeral) in nature—are no longer there and can, in the traditional sense, not be preserved, stored and collected for the future. But that does not mean that we should completely forget about these fleeting works or stop considering (alternative) ways to pass them on and make them ‘last.’ But how does one pass on these ephemeral forms of art, without limiting or stabilizing them? How does one keep them ‘in motion’ to prevent them from vanishing into thin air? And who should take part in these practices of safeguarding and transmission? In this ‘Spotlight article,’ I make an argument for moving from practices of co-production to practices of co-care, and for taking into account the so-called ‘living documents:’ those audience members who once participated in the events in the 1960s and 1970s and can now, when still alive, be considered valuable repositories of data, stories and memories.",

We constantly apply it in interactions between people, organizations, animals, and even artifacts. We use it instinctively and implicitly in closed and static systems, or consciously and explicitly in open or dynamic systems. An epitome for the former case is a small village, where everybody knows everybody, and the villagers instinctively use their knowledge or stereotypes to trust or distrust their neighbors. A big city exemplifies the latter case, where people use explicit rules of behavior in diverse trust relationships. We already use trust in computing systems extensively, although usually subconsciously. The challenge for exploiting trust in computing lies in extending the use of trust-based solutions, first to artificial entities such as software agents or subsystems, then to human users' subconscious choices.",

Epigenomic controls only compound the sophistication of these formalisms. Life employs representationalism through the use of symbol systems. Life manifests autonomy, homeostasis far from equilibrium in the harshest of environments, positive and negative feedback mechanisms, prevention and correction of its own errors, and organization of its components into Sustained Functional Systems (SFS). Chance and necessity—heat agitation and the cause-and-effect determinism of nature’s orderliness—cannot spawn formalisms such as mathematics, language, symbol systems, coding, decoding, logic, organization (not to be confused with mere self-ordering), integration of circuits, computational success, and the pursuit of functionality.

Presumably, you will be able to comply immediately and easily, without having to do something else first, and without having to invest too much effort. But then, try to conjure up a visual perception of a sunny forest, or to form the judgement that Goethe once visited Stoos, just like that—that is, without resorting to additional actions, such as travelling outside of the city, consulting a biography of Goethe, or taking a perceptionor judgement-inducing drug. Presumably, you will fail. What these examples suggest is that there is a fundamental—though perhaps not necessarily strict—divide among the phenomena making up our mental lives. On the one side, there are our deliberate and straightforward mental actions and the mental episodes which they produce (and sustain). Conjuring up an image or supposing that something is the case should count—if anything should—as paradigm instances of deliberate mental agency, namely as instances of the activity of imagining something.1 Very roughly, they are examples of agency because they rationally respond to and are guided and possibly justified by certain practical reasons (i.e. those provided to us by our desires or intentions to picture or suppose something); they constitute mental actions because they are aimed at the production of some mental phenomena (i.e. an image or a supposition), and because their performance does not involve bodily movements, but occurs exclusively within the mind; they are deliberate because they are done in full, attentive consciousness of the means, ends, and intended results involved; and they are straightforward—or ‘light-fingered’ (O’Shaughnessy 1980: 21–2)—in that they are not done by performing another action which deliberately exploits certain passive effects (such as those of emotional dispositions,",

The advent of operational thought might be expected to facilitate category acquisition because it engenders a competence to suppress figurative dissimilarities and focus on nonfigurative similarities (e.g., common function). Age- and grade-equivalent preoperational and concrete operational groups were given oddity, sort, and category membership tasks with pictorial stimuli. Concrete operational subjects showed a greater appreciation than preoperational subjects for taxonomic relations involving atypical exemplars. Subjects of both cognitive levels could appreciate taxonomic relations involving strictly typical or moderately typical exemplars of a category. Results are interpreted as supporting a contention that meanings become more general with the emergence of operational thought. Superordinate concepts are abstract organizations such as clothing, furniture, fruit, and animal, having basic object concepts (e.g., skirt, pants; chair, table; apple, banana; bird, fish) as exemplars. The basic object level of a conceptual hierarchy is the most inclusive level at which the exemplars of a concept share a large number of features (Rosch, Mervis, Gray, Johnson,",

Even if you are lucky enough to grab a fish, the chances are that just when you think you have caught it, the fish will vigorously slither out of your hands and jump back in the stream. Values and ethics similarly slither through our fingers for a variety of reasons: we don't try hard enough to catch them, preferring the practical business of doing social work; the subject matter, if we really investigate it, may sometimes seem complex, hard to grapple with and possibly obscure; there is a lack of conceptual clarity about many of the terms used that form part of the lexicon of 'social work values and ethics'; the boundaries of 'social work values and ethics' are imprecise and ill-defined, so the notion of what should constitute 'social work values and ethics' is itself part of a discussion about the nature of social work values. No doubt there are other reasons for not picking up this particular fish! Yet despite these difficulties in picking up the 'fish', there is something that intuitively suggests that social work is bound up with values and ethics. Is not ethics, according to the Oxford English Dictionary, 'the science of morals in human conduct', and is not social work about human relationships and behaviour? This conjunction is suggestive of a duty upon social workers to understand both ethics and social work.",

Through the narratives of their work, they show what is not always visible in archives. Their artworks confront us with unarchived and unarchivable dimensions (what is not archived and what cannot be archived), constituent of how archives are created. In studying the archives that are part of found-footage works through an archival usage framework (exploitation), three main cat- egories of the unarchived and the unarchivable emerge: absence, which is linked to gaps, fragments, and incompleteness; the forbidden, which manifests in archives as material traces; and the invisible, which is not shown. These three categories have to do with an unconceived ( impensé ) state – a state of the archival field reflecting the intentional or unintentional inconceivability or omission of some of its theoretical or practical aspects. By investing in the unconceived – in other words, by studying archival science from practices on the margins – it is possible to renew ideas and discourses inside the discipline.",

      "title": "That is thou — Autonomy and wholeness in creative art",
      "abstract": "All investigative, expressive and creative endeavours—cate gorised as intellectual, artistic, scientific and so on—are ultimately attempts to search, seek or to rediscover one's relationship with the cosmos and find a place in the universe. These kinds of endeavours either arise out of some presumed—a priori— socially conditioned metaphysical assumptions or out of a recreation of new metaphysical truths, perhaps, directly perceived. At some point or points in one's life these attempts gain primacy, as in 'crisis' periods, when one needs to reaffirm a harmonious relationship between the self and the world in which one lives. (The falseness or truth of the duality of 'self and the world' need not be discussed at the moment.) The self in this case may be defined as the person (with a self-image) who projects and identifies himself with other persons and other non-human existence as also, especially, with various socio-cultural concepts such as family, society, nation and so on. Individual existence implies relationships, be it with nature or humans; whether this relationship exists in the person's mind or outside, he or she cannot do without it. The word 'person, synonym for self, is deliberately used because it means 'mask' (Latin derivative—persona). This particular use of the term 'person' is different from the category of 'being', or 'human being'. In fact, even the word 'individual' is derived from the root word 'whole' or 'complete'. In this sense, the same applies to the word 'alone'—all one (not to be confused with lonely), i.e. it is derived from the root of being One without a second—referring to a total, complete individual. In turn, whole-complete is the same as holistic, implying 'one-ness'. From this flows the idea of being holy, virtuous, and that is inseparable from the notions of beauty, goodness, love and creation. The experience of all these words may only be known within",

      "title": "What, if anything, can be considered an amodal sensory dimension?",
      "abstract": "The term 'amodal' is a key topic in several different research fields across experimental psychology and cognitive neuroscience, including in the areas of developmental and perception science. However, despite being regularly used in the literature, the term means something different to the researchers working in the different contexts. Many developmental scientists conceive of the term as referring to those perceptual qualities, such as, for example, the size and shape of an object, that can be picked up by multiple senses (e.g., vision and touch potentially providing information relevant to the same physical stimulus/property). However, the amodal label is also widely used in the case of those qualities that are not directly sensory, such as, for example, numerosity, rhythm, synchrony, etc. Cognitive neuroscientists, by contrast, tend to use the term amodal to refer to those central cognitive processes and brain areas that do not appear to be preferentially responsive to a particular sensory modality or to those symbolic or formal representations that essentially lack any modality and that are assumed to play a role in the higher processing of sensory information. Finally, perception scientists sometimes refer to the phenomenon of 'amodal completion', referring to the spontaneous completion of perceptual information that is missing when occluded objects are presented to observers. In this paper, we review the various different ways in which the term 'amodal' has been used in the literature and the evidence supporting the various uses of the term. Morever, we highlight some of the various properties that have been suggested to be 'amodal' over the years. Then, we try to address some of the questions that arise from the reviewed evidence, such as: Do different uses of the 'term' refer to different domains, for example, sensory information, perceptual processes, or perceptual representations? Are there any commonalities among the different uses of the term? To what extent is research on cross-modal associations (or correspondences) related to, or can shed light on, amodality? And how is the notion of amodal related to multisensory integration? Based on the reviewed evidence, it is argued that there is, as yet, no convincing empirical evidence to support the claim that amodal sensory qualities exist. We thus suggest that use of the term amodal would be more meaningful with respect to abstract cognition rather than necessarily sensory perception, the latter being more adequately explained/understood in terms of highly redundant cross-modal correspondences.",

Only with growth towards maturity do we become able to grasp generalities, universal values, abstract ideas. And even the maturest adult remains in large measure a child. His mind intimately bound up with a body always stands in need of concrete physical forms, places, events, persons. Therefore the Christian revelation, addressed not to disembodied spirits nor even to thinking machines, whose bodily life has been reduced to a minimum, like Mr. Wells’s Martians, has revealed the infinite and purely spiritual God in the very concrete and bodily form of Jesus Christ with the definite events and places of His earthly life. And that revelation is preserved and applied in a particular visible body of men with a visible head whose worship is filled with sensible symbols and whose supreme gifts of grace are bestowed through definite physical acts and objects. And if our mediaeval ancestors, children all their lives through, when compared with ourselves, whose outlook is even excessively, because selfconsciously and priggishly adult, exaggerated this necessary character of human religion, and sought a particular physical object to commemorate and enshrine every person and event of scripture, careless whether that person or event belonged to history or to sacred poetry, their exaggeration, if often amusing, is always sympathetic. For it is an outlook by which God is easier found, than by the scepticism which refuses to seek the Divine, outside the sphere of strict logical demonstration, where the deepest truth is never found.",

More specifically, reflection, comparison, and imagination are thought to exist only after the onset of perfectibility, but these mediating capacities are always already present in pity and self-love, as well as for the “independent” savage, calling into question the possibility that any human sentiment or condition could be immediately accessible and fundamentally imbuing human life with ambiguity, fluidity, and disorder. Consequently, morality and freedom for Rousseau require the negotiation, stabilization, or management of the unstable “things between” human beings and their experiences, the object world, and others, even as such management is best hidden from view and experienced as given and true.",

      "abstract": "Abstract: It is sometimes said that humans are unlike other animals in at least one crucial respect. We do not simply form beliefs, desires and other mental states, but are capable of caring about our mental states in a distinctive way. We can care about the justification of our beliefs, and about the desirability of our desires. This kind of observation is usually made in discussions of free will and moral responsibility. But it has profound consequences, or so I shall argue, for our conception of the very nature of beliefs and other mental states. Suitably developed, it allows us to draw a line between two distinct ways in which a creature may possess a belief, represent a scene, and fall into error. The first way (which I shall call the ‘mindless’ way) involves little more than an encoding of information in some way designed to guide appropriate response. This is the common heritage of humans, and many other animals. The second way (which I shall call the ‘mindful’ way) requires that the creature be capable in addition of a special kind of second‐order reflection, and (importantly) be expert at detecting the kinds of situation in which such reflection is called for. The differences between these two ways of ‘believing that P’ are sufficiently deep and significant to warrant (or so I claim) our treating them as two distinct classes of mental states. For it is only courtesy of the second layer of complexity, I shall argue, that it becomes proper to hold someone accountable for their beliefs or other mental states, and it is this fact of (something like) accountability that in turn raises the most significant challenge for philosophical attempts to give naturalized accounts of meaning, belief, and mentality.",

      "title": "Self-Injurers as Loners: The Social Organization of Solitary Deviance",
      "abstract": "ABSTRACT In this paper we examine the social organization of people who deliberately destroy or damage their own body tissue without suicidal intent. Best and Luckenbill (Citation1982) have proposed two typologies of deviance performed by solitary actors: loners, who lack the regular association with fellow deviants and have no membership in a deviant subculture, and individual deviants, who are the actors and objects of their behaviors, yet socialize with others like them. Based on a convenience sample of 40 in-depth interviews with people who self-cut, burn, brand, scratch, bite, and bone-break, we describe and analyze the way their behaviors correspond to and differ from other forms of individual and loner deviance. Notes 1While people may do a variety of almost unimaginable things to themselves, such as self-amputating, drilling holes into their skulls, intentionally making themselves ill (Munchausen Syndrome), and decorating their bodies in extremely radical ways, these behaviors fall outside of the behaviors clinically associated with the specific syndrome known best at the turn of the twenty-first century as self-injury. We therefore restrict our focus to these practices not arbitrarily, but because they have been traditionally associated together in the medical literature and because they are performed by a constant group of people. In other words, people who intentionally make themselves ill or who cut off their limbs are not the same people who cut or burn themselves, and people who get tattooed or scarified come from a dramatically different etiology than people who self-injure, despite the fact that members of both groups may carve words or designs into themselves. These are different phenomena practiced by different people. 2Suyemoto and Macdonald (1995) also noted that most self-injurers desisted after adolescence. 3We were not permitted to interview participants under the age of 18 without parental consent, which blocked many current self-injurers from the study, as most ceased the behavior by the age of 18, and few under that age revealed their behavior to their parents. In addition, we were blocked from interviewing current students, who were the most frequent volunteers for our sample, and by making people wait a semester to be interviewed, we lost participants who transferred, moved away, or lost their nerve to participate in the research. 4Estimations of participants' cessation come from their own self-reports and may therefore not be completely accurate. 5They thus had many demographic similarities to the population of individuals with eating disorders. 6Some of the self-injurers we interviewed were neither loners nor individual deviants. Out of the 39 people we spoke with, three were clearly not loners because even though they performed the acts on themselves, they cut, branded, burned, or even electro-shocked themselves socially, in the company of one or more friends. Several more knew and spoke with others who self-injured, although their associations with them were deliberately limited. One of our participants was not an individual deviant, because he required the participation of others to perform the act (he and his friends held hands and electro-shocked themselves in a chain off of a generator or an electrical socket). These outliers are not the main focus of this paper, and they are probably rare, so for the main we will not include them in our descriptions and analyses. 7Some popular treatments that came to public attention leading up to or around this time included films such as \"Girl Interrupted,\" \"Nightmare on Elm Street III,\" and \"Secretary,\" television shows with episodes on cutting such as \"ER,\" documentary treatments on The Learning Channel, popular songs such as \"Hurt\" by Nine Inch Nails, \"Crawling\" by Linkin Park, \"Back to the Coast\" by Nikki Sudden, \"Last Resort\" by Papa Roach, and personal revelations from Richey Edwards, the guitarist and songwriter for Manic Street Preachers. See also Egan (Citation1997). 8Some of these included people such as Johnny Depp, Drew Barrymore, Angelina Jolie, Christina Ricci, Fiona Apple, Richey Edwards, Courtney Love, Marilyn Manson, Shirley Manson, Elizabeth Wurtzel, and Princess Diana. 9Hodgson (Citation2004) also talked about people who learned about self-injury from others as a route into the behavior. 10People weaned themselves from self-injury in much the same ways Granfield and Cloud (Citation1999) discussed drug addicts overcoming addiction without treatment. 11One social self-injurer was drawn in by a member of the other gender into a series of coupled sessions, where they cut and licked each others' blood. This was defined as very erotic. 12Rosenthal et al. (1972) found, in contrast, that over half of the 18 participants they studied made their cuts on Friday or Saturday nights, with another peak occurring on Wednesday afternoon. 13Favazza (1996) also noted that some self-injurers do not feel the pain from their body mutilation. 14Out of curiosity he used the knife later to try to cut himself. He wanted to experience the benefits of the self-injury firsthand. Yet, lacking the angst that brought most self-injurers to their behavior, all he got were some scars and a lot of pain. He offers an interesting example of a \"failed cutter.\" 15This sentiment clearly became more widespread, as self-injury diffused through the culture and websites devoted to it sprang up in the early 2000s. In a future work (Adler and Adler, in preparation), we discuss the proliferation of website chatting about self-injury, and the types of interactions and support people offer each other via these anonymous and distant, yet frequent, regular, and often intimate internet relationships and communities. 16Solomon and Farrand (1996) also reported a case where a young woman chose self-injury as an alternative to suicide, considering the former preferable. 17In this, self-injurers resemble the shifts and oscillations of deviants trying unsuccessfully to quit the deviant world but being drawn back in, only to foray out and relapse once again (see Adler and Adler 1983). 18In describing the self-injury of the cutters she studied, Hodgson (2004) also noted that they used non-normative means to appear normal.",

      "title": "Retracted Article: Use of Ruqyah in Patients with Neuropsychiatric Disorders",
      "abstract": "The term \"complementary medicine\" or \"alternative medicine\" refers to a broad set of health care practices that are not part of that country's own tradition or conventional medicine and are not fully integrated into the dominant health care system.[1] Ruqyah (plural: ruqa), an example of complementary medicine treatments, derives from the past tense verb raqa. It consists of words said or written in the form of dua or dhikr for the purpose of protection or cure. It is sometimes accompanied by other actions, such as blowing or wiping over the thing which it is applied to. \"It should be done by reciting the words of Allah, may He be exalted, or His names and attributes, and in Arabic or in a language the meaning of which is understood, and with the belief that ruqyah has no effect in and of itself; rather it is only effective by the will of Allah, may He be exalted.\"[2] Ruqyah practice can improve one's calmness, spiritual quality, and happiness, as a characteristic of an individual's mental health. Ruqyah practices are an effort to restore human nature (fitrah) that has inner peace and happiness.[3] The Quran says, \"Without doubt in the remembrance of Allah do hearts find satisfaction.\"[4] Herein, we presented the use of ruqyah as shifa (cure) in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders to draw attention to the importance of ruqyah applications in clinical practice.",

      "abstract": "Why do people hold religious beliefs about the existence of divinities, spiritual entities or God(s)? There is no single answer. One time-honoured commonly adopted \"folk\" explanation, given by believers themselves and aided and abetted by theologians, takes at face value the existence and casual effi cacy of divinities and gods in ultimately bringing about beliefs in them. Alternative explanations do not accept this \"folk\" stance and propose rival explanations of religious belief which reject any appeal to non-natural entities such as God(s); instead, they appeal to naturalistic entities or processes such as particular mental features of believers, their social conditions and the like. On this view, the cause of the way religious believers take the world to be is not a response to the way the world actually is; the cause is located in something that has nothing to do with God(s).",

The sense of happynes can be considered as a Stoic ideal – virtue ensures the happynes – or an Epicurian ideal – happynes ensures virtue. In a contemporary ideal version, the coalition betweeen happynes and virtue is considered the greater good. The uncertainty maintained by the lack of coherence and depth of the modern society rhythms is the source of a persistent individual feeling of incompleteness and lack of sense, as well as the burden of free governing his own life. Pathological personalities from cluster B have a limited access to happynes, because they think of it as a “virtue”, which they are looking for all their life in a selfish and anarchic way, but outside themselves, and at the same time always considering unhappy.",

      "title": "The Production of ‘Creativity’",
      "abstract": "My position in this chapter is that there is no such thing as creativity. I mean this in two senses. First, creativity is not an object: not something that can be looked at from different angles, conceived in different ways. It is a concept, which is to say that unless one subscribes to Plato's theory of Forms it has no existence apart from its own history as a concept. This history is recent and largely Western. Attempts to contrast 'Western conceptions of creativity' or 'post-Romantic conceptions of creativity' with their opposites are, on this understanding, attempts to contrast tautologies with oxymora, one might as well contrast Christian and non-Christian conceptions of Original Sin. Second, creativity is not an objective property: not something that can be present in or absent from particular people, acts, texts, utterances, etc. It can only be ascribed, which is to say that it is always a function of social interactions that - often retrospectively, and always provisionally - produce particular people, acts, texts, utterances, etc. as creative or non-creative. This is the approach that I call 'critical'.",

I do not wish to deny that God brings or brought things about (e.g. that the universe continues to exist or that St Paul was converted). So my “God does nothing” has a special sense (it does not deny that action can be ascribed to God). But what I intend in saying it is, I think, something of great importance when it comes to thinking about God in a sensible way. To grasp the point I want to make will save one from following all sorts of false trails when it comes to reflection on divinity. Let’s start with what is going on when you or I act. Examples of human actions could include opening a door, wiping one’s nose, making a telephone call, baking a cake, and waving goodbye to a friend. But what is common to these examples, and to others which might be mentioned? There is at least one thing common. For they all involve people going through a process. I open a door by reaching for the door handle and exerting a continued pressure on it. I wipe my nose by transporting with my hand an object to my nose and moving it about. I bake a cake by walking around a kitchen and following a recipe. I wave good-bye to a friend by lifting my arm and going through a waving motion.",

In the course of these activities, children make and hear a number of statements about themselves and other children, and they also encounter ideas about and representations of childhood in general, for example when reading stories or walking through temples. But it is difficult to hold in mind the distinction between children and ideas about childhood. And how, in any case, would such a distinction be made? Could someone who thinks of herself as a Chinese child totally fail to see herself in a story about Chinese childhood? If she almost recognised herself, would I then say that she was bound to be influenced by the story? In which case, where would the representation end and the child begin?

Prerequisites for prevention of repetition of crises, as well as for their abolition, include requisitely holistic individuals. Hence the humans/organizations should look at humans as multilayered entities. In synergy, not only as a sum, we define humans as: (i) physical, (ii) mental, (iii) social, (iv) spiritual, (v) economic, and (vi) specialized professionals, i.e. entities, marked by requisitely, though not absolutely, holistic pattern of relatively permanent charac-teristics. All these and other attributes form synergies. This gives the basis for behaviour of individuals, including in their roles as employees. It offers a possible answer to crisis of 2008-, if the individuals evolve from being merely owners to requisitely holistic creators, who enjoy subjective and objective welfare more than the others. So far theory has covered requisite holism of approach, but not of individuals’ personalities.",

      "abstract": "We think of the world around us not as a mere assemblage of unrelated objects, events, and facts, but as constituting a system, something that shows structure, and whose constituents are connected with one another in significant ways. This view of the world seems fundamental to our scheme of things; it is reflected in the commonplace assumption that things that happen in one place can make a difference to things that happen in another in a way that enables us to make sense of one thing in terms of another, infer information about one thing from information about another, or affect one thing by affecting another. Central to this idea of interconnectedness of things is a notion of dependence (or, its converse, determination): things are connected with one another in that whether something exists, or what properties it has, is dependent on, or determined by, what other things exist and what kinds of things they are. It is in virtue of these dependency or determinative relationships that the world can be made intelligible; and by exploiting them we are able to intervene in the course of events and alter it to suit our wishes. Activities like explanation, prediction, and control would make little sense for a world devoid of such connections. The idea that real connections exist and the idea that the world is intelligible and controllable are arguably an equivalent idea. Causation is a preeminent example of what I am calling determinative or dependency relations; apart from those that are logically based, such as entailment, it is the only explicitly recognized and widely discussed relation of this kind. Causes determine their effects, and effects are dependent, for their existence and properties, on their causes. It is not for nothing that",

It is created by ASD children in the process of emerging from their autistic states. In fact, the process of acquiring an analyst-based coverage can prove to be quite traumatic for both child and analyst. For the ASD child, emerging into the world of human relationships is a terrifying experience at worst, an uncanny one at best. The realities of separateness, dependence, mental boundaries, transience, and triangulation often shock the child back into the familiar, \"very same\", retreat of the autistic encapsulation. The appearance of an analyst-based mantling, while threatening to constitute a difficult impasse or a defensive pathological organization, might also pave the way for a better recognition of the psychic, physiological, and behavioral properties of the other and, through him, of the self.",

Yet in contrast to mimesis, which often seeks to reproduce an image of the object that is being copied, mimicry can have a humorous and even subversive potential that deliberately sets out to challenge the meaning of the object that is being copied or represented. This is not to say that the act or practice of imitation is restricted to literature and the visual arts, however, since the imitation of other human beings is also one of the formative processes through which children learn to speak, act, and perform as socialized human subjects. Furthermore, in biology, the practice of mimicry denotes the close external resemblance of an animal or plant to another, or to an inanimate object (OED) , in some instances as a tactic of self‐defense.",

      "abstract": "The living social reality was for Cooley the society of which he was a part, which he approached by objective introspection. Society is an affair of a consciousness that is necessarily social. The self is not a presupposition of consciousness but arises in communication and is dependent on others who are as immediate as the self. In imagination both self and other have their origin. Public consciousness is the organization of the separate individual experiences. The self is not an immediate character of the mind, for we are not first individual and then social; the mind itself arises through communication. This represents an advance on Baldwin, Tarde, and even James. A self that can reach other selves only through the interpretation of states of consciousness can never be primarily a social self. A difficulty arises when the parallelism of \"ordinary psychology\" is accepted by Cooley. His ethical views ignored primitive impulses and insisted on standards already established. He was not interested in the scientific study of society. But does not the self belong to an objective phase in the tendency to take the role of another? Cooley did not find selves and society arising in primitive processes of communication so that he could grasp their reality in early human behavior. His sociology was in a sense an account of the American community to which he belonged. The gospel of Jesus and democracy were of the essence of it. But if we carry back the social behavior to a point which antedates the psychical as distinct from an outer world, it is to this primitive behavior that one can trace the social patterns that produce society as well as to criticism and reconstruction. To this type of analysis Cooley's assumption closes the door. But Cooley's establishment of the self and others on the same plane of reality and his impressive study of the primary group are positive accomplishments for which we are profoundly indebted.",

The individual is expected to have reverence and awe for these forces; hence he/she is consistently striving to fit into the established structure of Being for his/her own good. The paper asserts that this is not a fair situation because it is the individual who conceptualizes and constructs such an idea of Being to account for his/her perplexing, multifaceted experiences and his/her ontological wonder; the individual is the fundament of Being; he/she illuminates Being. Thus, though the structure of Being in which the Esan finds himself/herself playing important roles in his/her life and in the society, he/she must not always strive to fit into it, particularly when it outlasts its suitability for answering fundamental and baffling questions that keep confronting the individual in his/her existence. Since Being keeps unfolding and our knowledge of the Being-process is never complete, the individual must therefore consistently revisit, re-conceptualize and improve on the prevalent conception or structure of Being in order to account for current experiences that confront him/her.",

Current thinking frowns upon the axioms of origin, of authorship, of the unitary validating enactment. In the swirl of contextualization and dialogicity, a genuine starting point will go down as a dubious fiction. “The genesis…is never more than a transition from one structure to another, but also a formative transition that leads from a weaker to a stronger structure.” Edward Said borrows Hayden White's deprecatory coinage “inaugural gestures” to convey the artificiality and delusoriness of a sense of beginning. He lists the various ways in which “beginning” can be understood: as physical exigency, as a departure from an antecedent, as a moment in time, a place, a principle, an action, a verbal stratagem of easing into sequence. His expansive temper and his commitment to renewal condition him to see in a genuine beginning a revolutionary element, challenging the conventions but also harnessed by the structures of the context. Nowhere in his massive book does Said provide a discussion of how a writer's first paragraph relates to the larger enterprise; his concern is with the total enterprise as a beginning.",

Moreover, since it not only becomes small, but can move manually if it arrives at the purpose and this equipment will be removed, the approach to a toilet, a restroom, a table, etc. is also easy.",

      "title": "MEASURE FOR MEASURE:<i>THE RELIANCE OF HUMAN KNOWLEDGE ON THE THINGS OF THE WORLD</i>",
      "abstract": "When all things were in disorder, God created in each thing in relation to itself, and in all things in relation to each other, all the measures and harmonies which they could possibly receive. —Plato, Timaeus (69b) Is my body a thing, is it an idea? It is neither, being the measurant of the things. We will therefore have to recognize an ideality that is not alien to the flesh, that gives it its axes, its depth, its dimensions. —Maurice Merleau-Ponty (1968, 152) The search for truths differs from the search for truth criteria in more ways than those that are immediately obvious. —M. C. Dillon (1997, 9) The notion that all knowledge is a form of measurement can be traced back to the Socratic insight that knowledge requires the presence of some standard against which things are measured. We cannot account for our knowledge of things, Socrates argued, without appealing to some prior capacity we have for recognizing, comparing, or measuring things in terms of something else, for example, a concept or definition. In the modern era, Kant extended this insight to include perception as such, [End Page 175] arguing that even though our perceptual experience seems to be direct and immediate, upon reflection we know that some process of mediation must be at work which enables us to have a stable experience of objects. Faced with such insights, we are compelled to ask how such measuring is possible. If experience and knowledge rely on some capacity for measurement, what is measurement and what does it entail? The most common contemporary answer to this question can be found in notion that our experience and knowledge are \"constructed\" by distinctly human, that is, cultural factors. Having abandoned Kant's notion of a priori knowledge and its various Idealist offshoots, contemporary constructivism nonetheless maintains that cultural structures (although not fixed or permanent ones) serve as the basic principles upon which experience and knowledge are built. Such a view has some merit, insofar as it enables us to acknowledge the mediated character of our experience, while also avoiding the problematic claims of traditional idealism. But as appealing as this view is, it raises the question of the place and role of nature in our experience. From a constructivist point of view, although we may acknowledge that our experience and knowledge depend in crucial ways upon natural elements and events, it can often seem naive to discuss the role of such natural factors within experience—except, that is, as we admit that nature itself is \"constructed\" by culture, for example, language, conceptual systems, theoretical constructs, ideology, political power, institutional practices, and so forth. That is, although we no longer accord cultural factors an a priori or absolute status, we remain convinced that in fact cultural norms play the final, determining role in shaping our experience. In the end, we have come to believe, it is culture that measures and defines nature, not vice versa. My aim in this essay is to articulate an alternative view of the measurement involved in human experience and knowledge, one which helps us to overcome the privileging of culture over nature that still plagues contemporary thought. My account is inspired by Merleau-Ponty's philosophy of the body, particularly his notion that the human body serves as a \"measurant of things.\" There are two key components of this claim. First, it describes the body's general capacity for measurement, and does not appeal to any specific measure or standard of measurement. As a measurant, the body is not any particular measure; rather, it is a thing that measures, an element of the natural world that brings measurement to the [End Page 176] things it encounters, thus bringing meaning into our experience. Second, the body's capacity to measure shows how our natural being as bodies is inherently meaningful, because measurement is, as we shall see...",

      "title": "Cognitive-Based Terminal State Prediction for Human Motion Planning",
      "abstract": "Every day, people are presented with tasks that are completed with very little mechanical effort such as turning a door knob, turning a screw driver, and grabbing a cup to move it to a new location and/or orientation. These tasks are often overlooked in the mechanical study of human movement due to the fact they carry with them very little biomechanical costs or effort. However, from a cognitive standpoint, these tasks carry high complexity. For example, the simple task of grabbing a cup and flipping it over is very easy mechanically and can be effortlessly achieved by a two year old. However, it is impossible to predict or simulate this motion without major intervention in the form of explicit constraints defining the task. The model itself cannot decide in which orientation the hand should assume in order to grasp the object. Also, it cannot decide where on the object the hand should be placed. These aspects must be assumed by the researcher and constrained in the formulation. In other words, digital human models, such as optimization-based motion prediction models, are unable to plan actions. This implies that for each task, a unique optimization formulation is needed in order to predict the motion/posture needed to complete each task. This paper presents a new method for task planning prediction within optimization based posture and motion prediction. It provides a new single optimization formulation that allows for the prediction of multiple unique manual manipulation tasks. The method is based on observations made from experimental studies on cognitive motor planning.",

      "abstract": "A sentence of Nadel is quoted from time to time to be criticised for the limit he set on interpretation: he wrote, ‘Uncomprehended symbols have no part in social inquiry, their social effectiveness lies in their capacity to indicate; and if they indicate nothing to the actors they are from our point of view, irrelevant, and indeed no longer symbols (whatever their significance for the psychologist or psychoanalyst)’ (1954, p. 108). Nadel can be understood to limit ‘symbol’ to those situations where the relationship between something and what it stands for is intended, conventional and can be put by the actor into words. It points up the distinction between the communication of meaning to people within the society (actors) and items of social behaviour or belief which express in an indirect or obscure fashion some principle, value, conflict or problem occurring in that society. Expression is not the same thing as communication. You can express your feelings to a stone, yet it is unmoved. You could also, like the mystic Henry Suso (Huizinga 1965, p. 148) eat three-quarters of an apple in the name of the Trinity and the remaining quarter in commemoration of ‘the love with which the heavenly Mother gave her tender child Jesus an apple to eat’ and unless you or Henry Suso told me, I would not, though I watched you twenty times, discern your symbolism or even that what you did was symbolical.",

But the most important characteristic of persons, for the Cappadocians, is that persons are essentially relational beings: ‘the person cannot exist without communion’ (Zizioulas, 1985, p. 18). Persons cannot exist as isolated individuals, and so Father, Son, and Spirit, if they are persons, can only exist in the closest relationship to one another – in communion. The divine being ‘precludes individualism and separation’ (Zizioulas, 1985, p. 49). The three persons are not individual examples of a common kind, each of which could exist apart: ‘none of them can be conceived apart from the rest’ (Zizioulas, 1985, pp. 48–49). It is not just that they cannot exist apart; they cannot even be conceived to exist apart.",

Man, and his culture and his living environments are always correlated. While measuring heritage architecture, one tends to ignore the cultural and societal factors as the stakeholders. This isolated study can often paint half a picture of what a place was or could have been. An in-depth understanding of the “human element” will help appreciate the true “spirit of the place” despite the style, geometry, material, or construction method. While looking at a piece of craft, present-day perception focuses only on certain limited qualities such as visual or construction. Instant benefit has led to mass use of fabricated materials while ignoring any cautionary examination. Definition of any material’s sensual, social and symbolic worth often remains out of the scope for judgment. If these values are prioritized well, the architecture can continue to progress as a modest expression, adding a personality or realizing a life rather than producing alienating objects.",

      "abstract": "We can draw distinction between the two different aspects of social order, ‹rule› on the one hand, ‹regularity› on the other. ‹Rule› is an order of which the participants of a society are aware. With relation to ‹rule› each bodily movement of the participants is understood as intentional “action”, since they are able to choose whether to obey or disobey to this ‹rule›. Compared to this, ‹regularity› is another form of order. It is utterly unknown by the participants themselves, but can be known by the strangers to this society as nothing else than what is indicated by the existence of factual bodily movements of the participants. These bodily movements are not usually understood as intentional or chosen “actions.” In the case of ‹regularity›, there exists no difference between social order itself and the whole of individual bodily movements. Accordingly, for we as participants to recognize this ‹regularity›, we have to differentiate it from our own bodily movements, and establish ‹rule› purposefully. This paper examines the socio-logical process of transformation of habitual ‹regularity› to coercive ‹rule› by making the concept of “action” as catalyst.",

Design/methodology/approach The paper looks at the mathematical and logical development of human society structure. Findings Existence of relations with positive imperative modality (obligation) would constitute the skeleton of the system. Negative imperative modality (prohibition) would be the immunological system of protection of the system. Modality permission the muscular system, that gives the necessary flexibility to the system, in as much to the modality faculty its neurocerebral system, because it allows him to make decisions. Transactions of energy, money, merchandise, population, etc. would be the equivalent one to the sanguineous system. These economic transactions and inferential relations, depend, as well, of the existence of a legislative body with their obligations, prohibitions and permissions that regulate them. A Social System Σ may be considered like an alysidal set with an only alysidal element. The authors consider two theories: Enlarged theory and Reduced theory.

      "title": "The Self and the Subject: A Psychoanalytic Lacanian Perspective",
      "abstract": "AbstractIn current research, the self, or the \"first-person perspective,\" is often studied in terms of its cognitive functions (agency, \"mind reading,\" body representation, etc.). As clearly shown by Decety (2002), these studies are based on the assumption that mental processes must be \"described in terms that make it clear that they are achievable by one brain.\" It has been well established, however, that though one human brain is necessary, it is not sufficient for the development of a psychic subject capable of mental processes. Indeed, to do so, the brain must be connected with a particular language system, which is external and exists prior to the birth of each human brain. Psychoanalysis demonstrates that such a process not only yields human individuals who consider themselves as autonomous egos with a cognitive representation of the external world, but that these humans also suffer a particular \"lack\" or \"want,\" which makes each of them a desiring subject. Regardless of the conscious representations of the \"self,\" the psychic life (including cognition) of this subject is governed by the repeated—though vain—search for a repressed object that cannot be represented. The contribution of psychoanalysis to understanding what constitutes the \"self\" was first indirectly demonstrated through the psychoanalysis of neurotic patients. The study of psychiatric or neurological pathologies, in particular psychosis (Cotard, Fregoli, and Capgras syndromes) or the right hemisphere syndrome (in particular, somatoparaphrenia), confirms these findings. This paper represents a contribution to the understanding of subjectivity through a psychoanalytic perspective on the Fregoli syndrome and somatoparaphrenia.Keywords: selfspecular imagebody imageidentificationmisidentificationsomatoparaphrenia",

      "abstract": "virtue of humility asks we listen to the witness of God every person. Nowadays humility is often confused with the sin of self-abnegation, the abuse of God's gift of life. And it is contrasted unfavorably with the sin of pride, taken Romantic theory to be a virtue. In science and scholarship-for example the science of economics-humility is necessary for excellence. But it is rarely practiced, and stands out when it is. Oddly, a conservative species of economics, so-called Austrian economics, recommends we see successful businesspeople as simultaneously humble and great-souled, balance. Romantic Pride, as Milton's Lucifer, persists the idol-worshiping of modern atheists. As the self-fagellating nun is proud she is not proud, the modern secularist is proud he is not humble before God. Both are mistaken. I cannot conceive the necessity for God to love inc. . . . But I can easily imagine he loves perspective of creation which can only be seen from the point where I am. ... I must withdraw so he may see it. Simone Weil, Gravity and Grace1 According to one standard English translation of Aquinass Swnma Theologiac, the humble person in respect of which is his own ought to subject himself to every neighbor, respect of which the latter has of God's.2 sentence is not any clearer the Latin, but seems context to mean merely this: we should respect other people what after all, has created. To scorn listening to others is to commit the chief theological sin against the Holy Spirit, pride. sparks of perfection people should be esteemed, that we may know the things are given to us by God, as Paul put it.3 Or, as Augustine wrote, also quoted approvingly by Aquinas, We must not esteem by pretending to esteem, but should really think it possible for another person to have something is hidden to us and whereby he is better than we are. And so too the founding Quaker, George Fox, who urged us to listen quietly and the witness of God every man, whether they are the heathen ... or ... do profess Christ.4 Or Father Peter Maurin, described by Dorothy Day after his death 1949 as truly humble of heart, and loving. . . . . . . saw all others around him as God saw them. In other words, he saw Christ them.5 Or Rabbi Jonathan Sacks 2002, since the point is not merely Christian: Truth on the ground is multiple, partial. . . . Each person, culture and language has part of it. ... [Jewish] sages said, 'Who is wise? One who learns from all men.'6 Humility enjoins listening for the sake of God's message within others. Shut up and learn something. Wisdom books of the Hebrew Bible are full of such advice, as the proverbs of Solomon: Wise men lay up knowledge, but the babbling of a fool brings ruin near (Prov. 10:14, RSV); He who belittles his neighbor lacks sense, but a man of remains silent (11:12); If one gives answer before he hears, it is his folly and shame (18:13). Or Jesus son of Sirach: The tongue of man is his fall. . . . But if thou love to hear, thou shalt receive understanding (Eccles. 5:13, 6:33, KJV). Some people without brains do an awful lot of talking, says the Scarecrow the movie of Wizard of Oz. Harry Truman defined an expert as someone who doesn't want to learn anything new, because then he wouldn't be an expert. Such pride is the opposite of humility, the humility to listen and learn. philosopher Amelie Oksenberg Rorty once described this habit of intellectual humility, rare among academics and politicians eager to speak and reluctant to listen. What is crucial is: our ability to engage continuous conversation, testing one another, discovering our hidden presumptions, changing our minds because we have listened to the voices of our fellows. Lunatics also change their minds, but their minds change with the tides of the moon and not because they have listened, really listened, to their friends' questions and objections. …",

According to the teaching of the Catholic Church, and this teaching is necessarily true, for the Catholic Church teaches with the authority of God Himself, the reason of man’s existence is that he may know, serve and love God. Every activity of man must be directed to those ends, otherwise man is false to himself, for he is acting against his nature, and false to God, for he is acting against his Maker. For such a creature as man, then, the work he does is not primarily that he may earn the food he eats, the shelter he needs and the food and shelter for the children he begets. Food and shelter are not the ends for which man works. On the contrary, man’s work is the end to which food and shelter are the means. We say that man’s work is the end. That is to say, it is the immediate or proximate end. The ultimate end, the final end is God. All food and shelter are things to help man in his work; all work is to help man to his God. Now under the stress of an irreligious and therefore an ill-organised society, these things are forgotten or denied; God Himself is forgotten or denied, and men think of themselves as working merely in order to live. Food and shelter are proclaimed to be the ends for which men work and, being reduced to the level of a means to merely earthly existence, work is degraded and derided.

      "title": "The Phenomenon of Aggressive Behavior of Learners in the School Situation.",
      "abstract": "Aggression is an internal process of human being in relationship with his/her self, other persons and the environment. The external manifestations of aggression, whether constructive or destructive, are not the starting point of aggression. Aggression develops from childhood and continues into adulthood. In this regard Chamberlain (2000:1-4) even states that aggression can develop from before birth. Aggression starts within the psychological world of the individual. The way in which the individual interprets his/her perception will elicit an emotional response that will affect the person's decision on what to do with his/her interpretation of the world. What matters is the way it is expressed-either constructive or destructive behaviour. Aggression is expressed in a constructive manner if it is about the survival and personal and healthy growth of the individual, family, group and/or the community. Aggression is expressed in destructive manner if it harms self and/or others and/or the environment (Tesser, 1995:383-418). According to Kruger, Rech and Van Staden (1993:9) aggression can viewed as any type of behaviour that is directed to harm, hurt, inflict pain or destroy another person when this person is motivated to avoid such behaviour. Aggression can also be self-directed-consciously or unconsciously (self-critical, self-harm, verbal threats and assault). Psycho-social factors that contributes towards aggressive behaviour include inability to cope with frustration; uncomfortable livelihood; exposure to aggressive models such as violence in the media and parents with aggressive behaviour; poor socio-economic circumstances especially in urbanized areas; poor family relationships; times of social stress (such as high inflation rate and increasing divorce statistics), and rejection by peers (Pepler & Sedighdeilami, 1998:205-214; Collings, 1994:35-37; Pulkkinen & Ramirez, 1991:69; Kruger, Rech & Van Staden, 1993:9-10). Situational factors can contribute towards aggressive behaviour including competitive sports, physical pain, anxiety, being in a crowed; and air and noise pollution (Smith & Furlong: 1998, 2021-202; Kruger & Van Staden, 1993:10). Biological factors contributing to aggression include constitutional factors (a person's temperament); genetics; hormonal factors; neuro-anatomical factors such as neurotransmission and neuro-logical disturbances (Mooij: 374; Kruger, Rech & Van Staden, 1993: 10-11). The self-determination theory state that the motivational orientation have been linked to how individuals regulate self-esteem in other potentially threatening contexts and social interactions (Hodgens, Koestner, & Duncan, 1996; Hodgins, Liebeskind, & Schartz, 1996; Knee & Zuckerman, 1996, 1998). Further, Deci and Ryan (1991) stated that when self-regulation proceeds according to an unintegrated aspect of the person, as with the ego involvement on controlled behaviour, the experienced emotion will be less flexible, more pressured, and more subjective to defensive reaction that less fully express one's integrated self. Investigators have operational zed self -determination in various ways, including the aspiration that individuals endorse (Kasser & Ryan, 1993, 1996), coercive elements of the social context (Deci, Spiegel, Ryan, Koestner, & Kauffmann, 1982; Ryan, Mims, & Koestner, 1983), self-reported reasons for engaging in various behaviours (Vallerand & Bissonette, 1992; Vallerand, Blais, Briere & Pelletier, 1989), and individual differences in motivational orientations (Deci & Ryan, 1985a; Hodgins, Liebeskind, et al, 1996; Knee & Zuckerman, 1996, 1998). This latter work on motivational orientations evolve from the assumption that people differ in the extent to which they regulate their behaviour based on autonomy and choice, or based on pressure (either real or imagined; Deci & Ryan, 1985a). Same-level or cross--level processes (interaction) may exist. …",

A vital issue in this controversy is how we should analyse two obvious but surprisingly problematical contrasts. The first antithesis is between things we do because we are forced, and deeds we perform because we want to — sometimes after having discovered preponderant reasons in their favour. The other polarity is more general. In most situations, if I act on my desire, I act more freely than if I had not had the desire. But what if my attitude is the product of childhood conditioning — or later brainwashing, brain surgery, hypnosis, behaviour modification, alcoholisim, narcotics addiction, neurosis, psychosis or worse? Then isn't my autonomy diminished? What is it about these latter desires, or their origin, that differentiates them from their unthreatening congeners?",

Material signals fall into two main classes: directing-to and placing-for. In directing-to, people request addressees to direct their attention to objects, events, or themselves. In placing-for, people place objects, actions, or themselves in special sites for addressees to interpret. Both classes have many subtypes. Features of material signals were examined in pairs of people who were videotaped as they assembled TV stands, built Lego models, planned furnishings for a house, played piano duets, or bought coffee at Starbucks. In these activities, the pointing and placements were often sustained, creating three phases of signals – initiation, maintenance, and termination – each with its own interpretation.",

Norms develop that ground perception and action, providing standards for appraising conduct. The body finds itself motivated to enact itself as a character in the drama of life, carving from its beliefs, intentions, and experiences a unique identity and perspective. If a biological body can construct itself into a person by exploiting social mechanisms, could an electromechanical body, a robot, do the same? To qualify for personhood, a robot body must be able to construct its own identity, to assume different roles, and to discriminate in forming friendships. Though all these conditions could be considered benchmarks of personhood, the most compelling benchmark, for which the above mentioned are prerequisites, is the ability to sustain long-term relationships. Long-term relationships demand that a robot continually recreate itself as it scripts its own future. This benchmark may be contrasted with those of previous research, which tend to define personhood in terms that are trivial, subjective, or based on assumptions about moral universals. Although personhood should not in principle be limited to one species, the most humanlike of robots are best equipped for reciprocal relationships with human beings",

      "abstract": "Among psychologists, it is widely thought that infants well under age 3, monkeys, apes, birds, and dogs have been shown to have rudimentary capacities for representing and attributing mental states or relations. I believe this view to be mistaken. It rests on overinterpreting experiments. It also often rests on assuming that one must choose between taking these individuals to be mentalists and taking them to be behaviorists. This assumption underestimates a powerful nonmentalistic, nonbehavioristic explanatory scheme that centers on attributing action with targets and on causation of action by interlocking, internal conative, and sensory states. Neither action with targets, nor conative states, nor sensing entails mentality. The scheme can attribute conative states and relations (to targets), efficiency, sensory states and relations (to sensed entities), sensory retention, sensory anticipation, affect, and appreciation of individual differences. The scheme can ground explanations of false belief tests that do not require infants or nonhuman animals to use language. After the scheme is explained and applied, it is contrasted with other, superficially similar schemes proposed in the literature-for example, those of Gergely and Csibra, Wellman and Gopnik, Perner and Roessler, Flavell, and Apperly and Butterfill. Better methods for testing are briefly discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record",

      "abstract": "Abstract Conventional monotheist religious believers commonly believe that God will sometimes assist them, will be on their side. God, in other words, they believe, is an asset. Conceptually an asset is anything (such as a person or an object) that can assist one, something that is prima facie good to possess or to have on one's side, that is likely to or can assist one to make one's life go better, overall. Having assets can have weighty implications, including moral ones. I argue that here the implications are quite surprising, and indeed paradoxical. In particular, the religious will have in certain circumstances good reasons, and sometimes even moral obligations, to give up their interests for those who lack such assets, namely secular non-believers. The claim is not that religious people actually see things in this way but that, normatively, given their beliefs, many of them should, in the sense of the subjective ‘ought’. This can be relevant both in this world and concerning the next. Moreover, in many situations plausible religious replies are not sufficient to block the move. This topic has not, to the best of my knowledge, ever been seriously analysed philosophically.",

The characteristics of an evil person, neatly summarized in Baumeister’s “myth of pure evil,” include a presumably unchanging, unrelenting capacity to inflict unjustifiable harm. Consequently, evildoers—which, in the popular imagination, include evil spirits, perpetrators of satanic ritual abuse, and serial killers—pose the ultimate threat. People may therefore resort to extreme measures (like potentially lethal exorcism attempts) to resist, punish, or destroy them. Places and things, by virtue of their association with evildoers and/or their capacity to evoke raw negative feelings such as dread, can sometimes function as evil symbols.",

      "title": "Libertad en Duns Escoto",
      "abstract": "Duns Scotus, due to the way active potencies act, distinguishes natural potencies from Will. Natural potencies, if all requisites are fulfilled, act determinately and necessarily; Will, on the contrary, is indeterminate and determines itself to act. Because of its indeterminacy, Will can choose contrary acts and contrary objects, that is, can choose A and -A. It chooses by itself one of both, it determines itself and nothing external determines it. Human will, due to its imperfection and mutabililty, can choose contrary objects with different willing acts and in different times. Divine will can, with one and the same willing act, choose simultaneously contrary objects, that is, A and -A. Given this divine freedom, all creatures -including physical or moral order- are deeply contingent, that is, they are in this way but they can be either otherwise or not to be. By His ordinate potency, God keeps the established physical and moral order; by His absolute potency, God can revoke this order and establish another, even temporarily. Divine knowledge of the created things that will be, cannot be a necessary knowledge meaning that it is impossible for A (that will be) not to be able to be. As a consequence of this contingency, 'a predestinate can be condemned'.",

      "title": "Relational goods and overcoming barriers to collective action",
      "abstract": "Relational goods contribute to understanding why people engage in collective action, notably including political participation, even though, as Olson showed, it would often be more rational for them to free-ride on the activity of others. Relational goods are neither public goods nor private goods but a third type of good. They must be jointly consumed with another person or persons (unlike private goods), but the identity of the other persons matters crucially (unlike the case for public goods). Relational goods can only exist by mutual agreement as part of a relationship with non-arbitrary others, in the context of an interaction. Friendship is a prototypical example. Relational goods can exist along a range of personal contact from direct, where individuals interact face to face, to indirect, where the interaction may be at a distance with a certain type of person. In the indirect case the relational good may frequently take the form of reinforcing a desired social identity. The distinction between “consumption” and “instrumental” goods applies, parallel with other usage. The consumption relational goods are produced independent of any consequences of the action or relationship, while the instrumental ones refl ect consequences, such as from an action that enhances the value of an identity. People who value relational goods may act collectively even if other net benefi ts of action are negative. Larger groups become more, not less, prone to collective activity. Relational goods provide a missing element to understand how the process of mobilization works at the individual level; leaders can infl uence people’s perceptions of what others are doing, of the value of a shared identity, and of the likelihood of success. Some limited empirical evidence is consistent with relational goods playing a role in enhancing collective action.",

There are regularities characteristic of beliefs and desires, regularities that dictate both the effect of certain sort of evidence on what beliefs and desires are maintained, and the effect of certain sorts of belief–desire profiles on what responses are evinced. Those regularities will typically identify what it is to be evidentially rational in the attitudes one holds and responsively rational in the responses one makes, though they may also point us toward obstacles that get in the way of rational performance. A system will count as an intentional agent to the extent that its interactions with its environment, or at least some of its interactions, are governed by such regularities.",

      "abstract": "The social inferiority of an elderly person stems from his physical inferiority--actual or alleged but always possible. And yet this \"inferior\" body is paradoxically hypertrophic: at first it masks the person, then takes up its space until it negates it. Hence, an elderly person is not only a body but a lonely body. In his relations with other people, his body becomes a receiver, a receptacle and a source of communication. Social violence underlies relations with elderly people: such violence may be deceptive, widespread and continuous or, on the other hand, manifest, episodic and conspicuous. In the first case it may be a way of assigning subalternate roles to them in relation to the efficiency expected of them or a way of mythologizing their condition as one of pseudo-happiness. In the second case is generally relates to assaults, thefts, bag-snatching, etc. In any case, however, communication with them entails violence: their body perceives this and reacts to it. This is why their body's language is violent: their body cries out, it is stunned and it is acted upon (even--and unavoidably--in relations with a therapist).",

These forces not only influence and condition his life but even determine it. Although determinism is different from the religious and popular conception of fatalism, which implies almost the total futility of the endeavors of a man, it also seriously enunciates a vital domination over the actions and life of man. It does not absolutely neutralize the spontaneity and freedom of man, but it does emphasize that human efforts and will work in a framework which is mighty and even uncontrollable. Some thinkers have pleaded for the philosophy of climatology or economic determinism, while others advocate a theological or absolutistic determinism.* ' In the dominant systems of Indian thought2 it has been held that the merits or demerits of the actions performed by a man, and the psychological impulsions behind them, accumulate, and, in the course of time, acquire such a vital potency that they determine the life of the man. Determinism serves to counter the tendency of explaining the facts in the universe and history in terms of a random conglomeration of atoms or the arbitrary fiat of an omnipotent God, who dispenses predestination. It pleads for the acceptance of a law-governed world and seeks to establish the determination of cosmic and historical operations in terms of laws. There is also a form of determinism,",

      "abstract": "Othello’s Testicles, Sybil’s Womb: The Interracial Child in Harlem Duet and its Progenitor David Huebert (bio) What is a penis without testicles? It is something severed, detached, incomplete—a hand without a thumb. It is unmistakably queer. I mean the word “queer” both in the quotidian sense offered by the oed—“strange, odd, peculiar, eccentric” (def. 1a)—and in the way Lee Edelman defines it: “queers—by which I mean all so stigmatized for failing to comply with heteronormative mandates—are not themselves also psychically invested in preserving the familiar familial narrativity of reproductive futurism” (No Future 17). The queer subject, in this line of thinking, is that which does not conform to the heterocentric injunction to procreate. The penis, thought without the testicles, likewise stands apart from the symbolic landscape of reproduction. Like Edelman’s “future-negating queer,” the unhinged penis exists outside the order of “pro-procreative ideology” (No Future 26, 12). The testicles themselves, unlike their isolated counterpart, are the primordial locus of futurity. The testicles in this sense have more in common with womb than penis. This article will examine testicles and wombs and, more specifically, the forms of futurity lurking within them, in Djanet Sears’s 1997 play Harlem Duet and its primary progenitor, William Shakespeare’s Othello. While Edelman is concerned with a “figural Child” who “affirms the absolute logic of reproduction itself” and “seems [End Page 23] to shimmer with the iridescent promise of Noah’s rainbow” (No Future 11, 18), I want to consider the representative of a different kind of future: the interracial child. Harlem Duet, like Othello, imagines an interracial child who is only ever hypothetical but who takes on all the more phobic resonance in its absence. In both cases, a child threatens to emerge from the union of a white woman and a black man and violate communal purity (Shakespeare 1.3.393). Complicating Edelman’s claim that the child is “the obligatory token of futurity” (No Future 12), I would like to draw on José Esteban Muñoz’s critique of the racial homogeneity at work in Edelman’s analysis in order to suggest that the interracial child in Harlem Duet is by no means the radiant signifier of the heteronormative order. This paper argues that Harlem Duet, in spite of Sears’s largely radical and productive feminist adaptation of Shakespeare’s play, retains a certain conservativism insofar as Billie expresses an inverted version of the interracial phobia of Othello—she, like Shakespeare’s Venice, fears that the uniracial community will be contaminated by the hypothetical interracial child.1 Harlem Duet, like its Shakespearian predecessor, presents interracial coupling, and by extension the hypothetical/symbolic interracial child, primarily as a menace, a threat to the future of community. Reading Harlem Duet alongside Othello in the context of the work of queer theorists Lee Edelman and José Esteban Muñoz raises pertinent questions for the potentially troublesome join of queer and racially motivated methodologies and the possibility of subversive Shakespearian adaptation.2 Can this would-be reparative [End Page 24] adaptation of a racially phobic play do more than recast Othello’s trajectory toward an ethnically pure Christian Venice as Billie’s desire for a racially pure black community in Harlem? How do Othello and Harlem Duet’s paranoid anxieties about the menacing interracial child trouble Edelman’s critique of reproductive futurism, wherein the child is the telos of a hegemonic white heterotopia? Can a queer politics that opposes the normativities of reproductive futurism still find a place for the interracial child? Ultimately, I show that Sears’s larger project in Harlem Duet transcends and casts doubt on Billie’s homoracialism and suggest that the play refuses to recapitulate Othello’s interracial phobia by leaving Mona, Othello, and their hypothetical child to enter an ambiguous future together. A central element of Edelman’s refusal of reproductive futurism is his radical claim that “queerness can never define an identity; it can only ever disturb one” (No Future 17). Queerness, rather than a purveyor of any kind of production, is for Edelman a chaotic force aligned with a Lacanian death drive. In the context of this view, the...",

Furthermore, triggers are events, and events involve an object acquiring a property. This leads to a regress problem for pandispositionalism, the view that all properties are dispositions. Some dispositions need a stimulus in order to manifest, and some do not. Dispositions that manifest spontaneously and those that are constantly manifesting do not have triggers.

This contrast between growth and development has been observed in organisms, individuals, social entities and bodies of knowledge. The foetus grows continuously in the womb, but it develops into a full human being shortly before birth. A child grows and changes gradually, but he goes through a major transformation over the period of puberty. Economies and societies are in constant evolution, but they undergo basic and radical reorganisations on few occasions. Clearly, growth is a necessary condition for development; just as clearly, it may not be a sufficient condition. Individuals may grow without developing into mature human beings, and ideas may evolve without succeeding to add significantly to the existing knowledge. Indeed, there is no reason or evidence why development itself should be necessary — i.e. inevitable — in all comparable cases. Even the Darwinian and other theories of biological evolution do not claim such an inevitability. The fact that a group of apes, bears or whatever, may have once evolved into human forms does not mean that the existing apes are likely to follow suit some time in the future. Unfortunately, this is a simple lesson which — in a wide variety of fields — seems to be readily forgotten: even if development itself is inevitable it does not follow that all development is inevitable. Indeed, it is likely that in the fields of human thought and action no development would be possible without a commensurate supply of effort.",

By consciousness, I simply mean those subjective states of sentience or awareness that begin when onenuAbove all, consciousness is a biological phenomenon. We should think of consciousness as part of our ordinary biological history, along with digestion, growth, mitosis, and meiosis. However, though consciousness is a biological phenomenon, it has some important features that other biological phenomena do not have. The most important of these is what I have called its subjectivity. There is a sense in which each person's consciousness is private to that person, a sense in which he is related to his pains, tickles, itches, thoughts, and feelings in a way that is quite unlike the way that others are related to those pains, tickles, itches, thoughts, and feelings. This phenomenon can be described in various ways. It is sometimes described as that feature of consciousness by way of which there is something that it is like or something that it feels like to be in a certain conscious state. If somebody asks me what it feels like to give a lecture in front of a large audience, I can answer that question. But if somebody asks what it feels like to be a shingle or a stone, there is no answer to that question because shingles and stones are not conscious. The point is also put by saying that conscious states have a certain qualitative character; the states in question are sometimes described as qualia. In spite of its etymology, consciousness should not be confused with knowledge, it should not be confused with attention, and it should not be confused with self-consciousness.

As an example, consider again the role of a monarch. As I have already pointed out, monarchs, despite being invested with titles suggestive of supreme power, may possess markedly different degrees of it in the three different dimensions of social structure. But even if the role carries ultimate title to all of the society's material resources, unchallenged ideological supremacy at the summit of an ascriptive hierarchy of deference, and total control over the means of coercion, the nature of the practices involved may vary widely from case to case.",

      "title": "When bad people do good things: will moral enhancement make the world a better place?",
      "abstract": "In his thoughtful defence of very modest moral enhancement, David DeGrazia1 makes the following assumption: ‘Behavioural improvement (ie, ‘greater conformity to appropriate moral norms and therefore a higher frequency of right action’) is highly desirable in the interest of making the world a better place and securing better lives for human beings and other sentient beings’. Later in the paper, he gives a list of some psychological characteristics that ‘all reasonable people can agree … represent moral defects’. I think I am a reasonable person, and I agree that most if not all items on the lists do represent moral defects—I certainly would regard them as such in a close family member or friend. But if I were in the business of ‘making the world a better place and securing better lives for human beings and other sentient beings’, I would hesitate to prescribe moral enhancement (or therapy—the distinction does not matter for my purposes) for everyone with these acknowledged defects. A lot of good work, from removing tumours to negotiating treaties, may be best done by people with serious moral defects.\n\nFor a simple consequentialist, a moral defect is just a trait that tends to make the world a worse place. Not being a consequentialist, I think that moral defects should be identified independently of their tendency to produce worse outcomes. For this reason, I think it's necessary to qualify DeGrazia's starting assumption—I think behavioural improvement may sometimes be undesirable if our goal is to make the world a better place. My reasons will be familiar to readers of Bernard Williams.\n\nAs …",

      "title": "Personal fowl: the Phoenix and the Turtle, and the question of character\"",
      "abstract": "Is THERE CHARACTER after theory? The question suggests two are adversarial, that latter works to destroy former or render it unworkable. Is there then before innocent of theory, now or in 1600? One thing practice of itself has observed is how theoretical terms such as may be both products of a theory and revisions or interruptions of it. Shakespeare did not invent notion of dramatic persons. If what he did with them seems to ask an answering innovation of critical vocabulary, what sorts of theory, if any, did he have access to about matter? That Shakespeare was profoundly interested in dramatic depiction of is not worth doubting. If copia was a virtue in Renaissance verbal art, his copiousness displays itself not only in his rhetoric but in his attentiveness to variety of persons. Not, of course, that complexities of personality are an issue for all who appear in his plays. are any number of figures for whom distinguishing traits are not provided: servants, messengers, soldiers, attendant lords, and other persons of narrative convenience. Familiar stereotypes often suffice for these, but even here unusual vividness is often to be found, giving as little as three lines an ample opportunity for an actor: Snug Joiner, Francis Feeble, Edmund's Captain. But though its richness of characterization has been a more or less perennial observation about Shakespeare's dramatic poetry in critics, audiences, and actors, it is worth recalling that Shakespeare nowhere uses word in modern moral or psychological sense we usually employ. Character for him always denotes an instance or effect of some kind of writing. (1) Most often, it is simply a synonym for handwriting, as when Laertes asks of Hamlet's letter, Know you hand? and King responds, 'Tis Hamlet's character (4.7.51). (2) Sometimes a collection of outward signs will be taken as a sort of inscription indexing moral traits, as when Viola says of Captain, I will believe thou hast a mind that suits / With this thy fair and outward character. (3) But even when, along these lines, Duke says to Angelo, There is a kind of in thy / That to doth thy history / Fully unfold, writing remains primary. The is in life (as if by Plutarch), not in person; the observer still reads a history. (4) Character, then, was not one of Shakespeare's terms for set of questions we usually entertain by notion. Even Shakespeare's few uses of term closer to our sense, from late in his career, seem hardly to touch issues that concerned, say, Bradley. Rather, these uses are related to contemporary revival of Theophrastan written by Joseph Hall and others. (5) When Menenius gives a bluff epitome of himself in challenge of tribunes, he asks, harm can your beesom conspectuities glean out of this character? (Coriolanus 2.1.64). Part of his point is that such a is a poor, bare device. Later, still more strongly, he bandies term at them again, saying of vengeful dragon Coriolanus, I paint him in character (5.4.26). Despite extending to a sense of portrayal, these remain essentially references to a genre of writing. What Menenius is doing does not bear much relation to what is going on in, say, dramatic depiction of Macbeth, even in one of his soliloquies. It is static and local, if pungent, where latter is extended and dynamic. If wasn't in Shakespeare's lexicon for what is going on, then we should look elsewhere. At least one other contemporary scheme for analyzing variety and individual bent of human behavior seems to have been, if fairly widely represented, yet also held at arms' length by Shakespeare. This is common and traditional medico-psychological language of elements and humors. …",

      "title": "Physical Activity",
      "abstract": "Physical activity is a significant element in enhancing the population's well-being.[1] Well-being is a condition of feeling good and functioning well, which helps people develop and thrive and control or manage life's negative, painful emotions.[23] Feeling good experiences are the positive emotions that give happiness and life satisfaction.[1] Physical activity improves human health, including mental health and stress tolerance, and thereby experiences pleasant activated feelings of joy and enhances overall well-being.[1] These people exhibit greater productivity, are more socially active, and are economically productive.[2] The World Health Organisation (WHO) has defined physical activity as 'any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that require energy expenditure'. It includes all movement accomplished during leisure time, work or transport.[4] Worldwide, physical inactivity and sedentary behaviour for prolonged periods cause several adverse effects on health.[56] Sedentary behaviour is well-defined by the Sedentary Behaviour Research Network as 'any waking behaviour such as sitting or leaning with an energy expenditure of 1.5 metabolic equivalent task (MET) or less'.[7] The report shows that long sedentary times are spent by people around the world, such as Americans spend 7.7 h/day equivalents to 55% of their waking time, Europeans spend 2.7 h a day which is 40% of their leisure time watching television, and Koreans spend 8.3 h of sedentary time.[6] The WHO reports globally, more than a quarter of the world's adult population (1.4 billion adults) are not performing enough physical activity. This is doubled in high-income countries compared to low-income countries.[4] In low-income countries, more physical activity is attributed to the workplace and transport.[8] The prevalence of physical inactivity in South-east Asia is 17%, while in the Americas and the Eastern Mediterranean is about 43%.[9] In Malaysia, one in four adults is physically inactive;[10] 20% of adults are physically inactive in Africa.[11] Rapid urbanisation and economic growth and technological advancement and social changes are related to declining physical activity globally and the incidence of non-communicable diseases (NCDs).[1213] The cultural values also influence physical activity in some places where women, older people and the underprivileged and disabled population do not get enough opportunities to access safe and affordable. Appropriate programs are required to remain people physically fit.[12] Additionally, lack of time, motivation, energy, fear of injury, sedentary work pattern, affordable facilities are common factors that inhibit people from being physically mobile.[14] Physical inactivity causes around 8% of NCDs and deaths.[15] It is reported as the 4th leading risk factor for death.[16] About 5.3 million people die yearly from physical inactivity and a sedentary lifestyles.[16] It is reported by Lee et al. that physical inactivity results in 6%−10% of the significant NCD such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, coronary heart disease, breast and colon cancer and 9% of premature mortality.[17] Worldwide, 7.2% of deaths due to other causes and 7.6% of deaths due to cardiovascular disease are attributable to physical inactivity.[15] Physical inactivity also contributes to obesity, high blood pressure, osteoporosis, lipid disorders, mental health problems and significant NCDs of colon and breast cancer, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. It ultimately leads to early death.[18] Moreover, health-related morbidity affects the population's quality of life and well-being.[16] In addition to this health-related burden, physical inactivity also imposes an enormous financial burden.[16] The attributes causing this financial burden are direct healthcare costs, lost productivity and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). Data from 142 countries (93·2% of the world's population) showed physical inactivity costs internationally US$ 54 billion/year in direct healthcare in 2013, of which $31·2 billion was paid by the public sector, $12·9 billion by the private sector, and $9·7 billion by households. While lost productivity due to physical inactivity costs INT$ 14 billion related to deaths and lifetime disease burden due to physical inactivity costs 13·4 million DALYs worldwide.[1219] High-income countries bear a more significant financial burden due to healthcare costs (80·8%) and indirect costs (60·4%). In comparison, low-income and middle-income countries bear a large proportion of the disease burden caused by physical inactivity (75·0% of DALYs).[19] Regular physical activity, such as walking, cycling, wheeling or any sports activity, is beneficial. It prevents and treats NCDs such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes and breast and colon cancer.[412] Patients benefit from physical activity to prevent obesity and hypertension and improve mental health, quality of life and well-being.[12] The numerous benefits of health and disease eventually reduce the mortality rate.[5] It is found that physical activity promotes weight loss and prevents weight regaining in overweight and obese people.[20] Performing exercise without any significant weight reduction is also beneficial.[5] Strength exercise is a powerful stimulus to improve and maintain bone mass during aging. Regular practice of multi-component exercise, including aerobic, high impact, and/or weight-bearing training for muscle-strengthening, bone-strengthening and whole-body vibration, can be combined with exercise help to increase or prevent the loss of bone density, especially in post-menopausal women.[2122] Regular physical activity in older adults improves their functional fitness,[23] helps to improve physical functioning and psychological well-being[24] and reverses some chronic diseases, and provides personal ability to live independently.[25] Physical activity by doing regular exercise reduces the cardiovascular risk factor by the reduction in body weight, reduction in the low-density lipoprotein level, total cholesterol, and increase in the high-density lipoprotein level as well as increases in insulin sensitivity and control blood glucose levels. It also improves the vascular wall function and oxygenation to the muscles.[26] Thus, the physical activity effectively prevents and treats high blood pressure, cardiovascular diseases, arthritis, osteoporosis, cerebral diseases, and complications. Physically active people showed higher satisfaction with life.[27] Reports indicated that physically active cancer survivors had fewer adverse effects and mortality from their cancer than inactive participants.[28] In addition to the health benefits, the active population can participate in productivity and economic development. The indirect benefits are less fossil fuel use, less congested and safer roads and reduced air pollution.[12] According to WHO, adults aged 18-64 years should have at least 150–300 min of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity each week or at least 75–150 min of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity; or a combination of moderate and vigorous-intensity activity throughout the week.[4] In addition, muscle-strengthening activities involving all major muscle groups should be practiced 2 or more days a week.[4] Moderate activity is similar to walking briskly at 3–4 miles/h. Any activities from occupational or recreational activities such as cycling, household work, yard work, swimming and dancing are considered moderate activities. Approximately five to seven 30-min sessions/week of moderate activity are equal to an intensity of 3–6 METs or about 600–1200 calories expended per week.[26] Vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity includes running, aerobic dancing, heavy yard work, hiking uphill or with a heavy backpack, cycling 10 miles per hour or faster, jumping rope, etc.[29] Awareness of the population is necessary to increase physical activity. Implementing a global action plan and a national plan to increase physical activity can motivate people. Providing facilities and workplace physical activity opportunities would increase physical activity levels. WHO has launched a global action plan to promote physical activity with four objectives and 20 policy actions aimed at reducing physical inactivity in adults and adolescents by 15% by 2030. It recommends more active societies by doing more walking, cycling, sport, active recreation, dance and play.[12] During transport, the use of non-motorised mode by use of cycle, or by walking and more active participation in sports, or passing active time during leisure time is encouraged. Therefore, providing cycling and walking infrastructure, improving road safety and providing the facility for physical activity for the community are necessary.[8] Physical activity has a significant impact on human health and well-being. Moreover, an active population is significantly involved in productivity and economic development. Therefore, it is necessary to increase awareness and motivate people and implement strategies to enhance and maintain the physical activity and well-being of the people.

      "abstract": "The purpose of this study is to investigate intrinsic values with respect to the nature of aim from the viewpoint of Dewey. The intrinsic values have been recognized as values independent of activities or the content that preexist before embodied into activities. But from the perspective of Dewey, intrinsic values can be revealed only through the activity. Because they are inherent in the activities. Dewey suggested that the educational aim that is influenced by the traditional metaphysics should be meaningless in that it is given from outside and not related to human activities. The educational purpose that influenced by modern metaphysics and contemporary theories also can be regarded external, because the content and value of learning are assumed ahead activities. In the view of Dewey, the concepts of values are exposed through activities, so they can not exist independently. According to his own metaphysics that organism and its environment interact each other, all values c an be formed only in the course of activities. Thus, the intrinsic value of Dewey is a process per se, as the intrinsic value cannot be assumed ahead activities but can be exposed through activities. Bringing meaning to life through experience is Dewey's concept of growth as an educational aim. Education under such a purpose, would give the foundation to cultivate talent who are creative, proactive and communicate with their neighbors as a member of a democratic society.",

Yet virtue ethics apparently has trouble accounting for the moral status of nonhuman animals because of its focus on excellent character traits, rather than the moral “patient,” and because of its non-codifiability, at least in some forms. The task of this article is to answer the question: How can virtue ethics account for the moral value of nonhuman animals in the context of biomedical research? I argue that it can do so through attention to animal good lives, human-animal bonds, and the virtues themselves. The virtue ethics resources I draw on to support nonhuman animal value are not the same as those typically brought to bear in moral status discussions, but I suggest that moral status as usually conceived has its own problems as a tool for use in practical contexts like animal research.",

Actually, self-regarding duties will sometimes positively support body modification – even extreme ones. This means that self-regarding duties of the sort related to what one may or may not do to one’s own body do not involve the sort of liberty-restrictions one may initially be inclined to assume they do. Our conduct is, to be sure, restricted by pro tanto self-regarding duties pertaining to capacities for autonomy and keeping one’s array of options adequate. Nevertheless, because autonomous living is more important than having the capacities to act autonomously and/or having adequate options, it is permissible for us to limit the latter to a significant degree or perhaps even destroy them completely as long as the life we live is an autonomous one.",

      "abstract": "Dramatizing Deviance:Sociological Theory and The Witch of Edmonton Julia M. Garrett [A] community's decision to bring deviant sanctions against one of its members is not a simple act of censure. It is an intricate rite of transition, at once moving the individual out of his ordinary place in society and transferring him to a special deviant position. The ceremonies which mark this change of status, generally, have a number of related phases. They supply a formal stage on which the deviant and his community can confront one another (as in the criminal trial); they make an announcement about the nature of his deviancy (a verdict or diagnosis, for example); and they place him in a particular role which is thought to neutralize the harmful effects of his misconduct (like the role of prisoner or patient). These commitment ceremonies tend to be occasions of wide public interest and ordinarily take place in a highly dramatic setting. —Kai T. Erikson, Wayward Puritans: A Study in the Sociology of Deviance The 1621 witch trial of Edmonton resident Elizabeth Sawyer is in many respects an unremarkable case. In fact, as I will explain in greater detail below, her trial might serve as a paradigm for the study of witch trials in early modern England. This particular trial, however, stands out in relief from the historical record in part because Sawyer's fate was taken up by a trio of London playwrights—Thomas Dekker, John Ford, and Thomas Rowley—and immediately translated to the stage in a 1621 play titled The Witch of Edmonton. While these dramatists were not alone in recognizing the commercial appeal of witch trials for theatrical adaptation, the play's compassionate depiction of Sawyer—largely Dekker's handiwork—is singular on a number of counts.1 Although hardly an exonerating portrait of the accused woman, the play nonetheless strives to inspire some sympathy for women like Sawyer who had been accused of witchcraft. Rather than focusing solely on the crimes attributed to such women, the [End Page 327] playwrights draw our attention to the circumstances of social alienation or even abuse toward suspects that often laid the foundation for suspicions of criminal conduct. This sympathy in itself is noteworthy, given the censorious climate for any form of skepticism about witch crimes, especially during the reign of King James I. What is particularly compelling about this play, however, is not simply the nature of its dissenting sentiments but the complexity of the social interactions it rehearses—the ways in which, as I will argue, it appears to be theorizing those social relations as much as representing them. This basic proposition, that a seventeenth-century play might serve as an early manifestation of sociological discourse, follows from a strong tradition of interdisciplinary scholarship in witchcraft studies. During the early 1970s Keith Thomas's Religion and the Decline of Magic and Alan Macfarlane's Witchcraft in Tudor and Stuart England imported interpretive methodologies from social anthropology into historical study and fundamentally transformed academic approaches to the study of witchcraft.2 Sociological historian Christina Larner, author of the most important studies on Scottish witch trials, further enhanced interdisciplinary insights about witchcraft through her nuanced analysis of the core gender questions raised by such trials. Larner's work is also important for its critique of the \"bottom-up\" theories about English witchcraft as represented in the work of historians such as Thomas and Macfarlane.3 More recent cultural studies scholars of early modern witchcraft (Frances E. Dolan, Gail Kern Paster, Diane Purkiss, Deborah Willis) have brought greater attention to literary representations and contemporary critical theory, formulating interpretations about witchcraft discourse through various theories of subjectivity, including feminist, psychoanalytic, and post-structuralist.4 Reflecting a broader shift in historical studies from macro-level to micro-level analyses of witch trials, these latter scholars have focused their attention on increasingly local and confined spaces—examining the social interactions of village communities, relations between neighbors, and the dynamics of the household. This narrower frame of social and cultural analysis is one that has clearly benefited from the hybrid interpretive methodologies of anthropology, sociology, history, and literary theory. However, an important dimension of sociological thought has yet to...",

      "abstract": "Extract What is love? What forgiveness? What, if anything, is their relationship? Historically and conceptually, as we will briefly sketch out, their origins and subsequent fates have been vastly divergent. And yet these terms and the realities—ideas, values, and affects, in short, the concepts and practices—they stand for have traveled parallel paths, just as they have often been associated, even to the point of confusion. Does love offer forgiveness? Does love require forgiveness in order to be what it is? Does one forgive out of love? Could one, precisely out of love, decide not to forgive? Can one forgive but not love? Is forgiveness a practical and pragmatic, perhaps even political or juridical concept, where love apparently is not? Or does love extend to a more than simply interpersonal level, captured also by other beings and things, groups and collectivities, nations and states, nature and cosmos? Nothing here is self-evident. Add to this that there is nothing sentimental or moralistic, nothing rosy, really, about these notions, that indeed love is not a bed of roses and forgiving is anything but forgetting, and one is soon convinced that one has entered a deeply problematic terrain. What in everyday life and popular culture—almost across times and worldwide—seems to need no further explication and, in fact, finds no ulterior reason for its very existence, glory, and terror, is steeped in more complicated (at times, paradoxical, perhaps aporetic) relations of networks of meaning, configurations of force.

      "title": "The Goodness of Creation, Evil, and Christian Teaching",
      "abstract": "The Thomist 64 (2000): 239-69 THE GOODNESS OF CREATION, EVIL, AND CHRISTIAN TEACHING1 PATRICK LEE Franciscan University Steubenville, Ohio It is at least a very venerable doctrine in Catholic circles that evil as such is a privation. That is, while there are evil things, what makes them evil (evil as such) is a lack of being that is due the thing. The simple example of blindness, a favorite in metaphysics and theology texts, illustrates the doctrine. Blindness is real, but it is not a nature or actuality; it is the lack of sight. Moreover, it is the lack of sight in a thing which is due sight-the lack of sight in a rock or a tree, for example, is not a privation but a mere negation and is not evil. As there are various types of beings, so there are various types of privations. There are privations in the physical domain (sickness, death, etc.), in the intellectual domain (ignorance and error), in the technological domain (inefficiency, malfunctions), and in the moral domain (omissions, commissions, vices, etc.). In this article I first argue that the position that every entity, accidents as well as substances, actions as well as other types of beings, is good to the extent that it is actual, and that therefore evil as such is negative, is immediately entailed by Catholic teaching. That is, although the thesis that evil as such is a privation is not defined,2 it can be inferred by a simple argument from defined teaching. No other position on evil is compatible with what the Church has defined. Second, I present philosophical and 1 I am grateful to John Crosby, Norris Clarke, S.J., Kevin Flannery, S.J., James T. O'Connor, and Germain Grisez, for reading and criticizing earlier drafts of this article. 2 Yet the proposition that evil is not a nature is defined (see below, p. 4). 239 240 PATRICK LEE theological arguments to support and explain the position that evil as such is a privation. Third, I examine objections to this position, and, finally, I indicate in some detail its practical import for theology-for this doctrine has a profound impact on how one views sin, salvation, and God himself. I Few people hold all of the doctrines that the ancient or mediaeval Gnostics or Manichaeans held. Everyone is aware that it is incompatible with Christian doctrine to hold that all matter is evil, or that there is a supreme, independent, evil god, a \"god of darkness.\"3 However, in reply to these heresies the Church not only rejected Manichaeism as a whole system but also made it clear that it is part of revealed doctrine that all being other than God, to the extent that it is actual, is from God, and is therefore good. The Manichaeans held that there was an evil god and a good god, that matter was the creation of the evil god and was evil, and that procreation was evil insofar as it subjected another spirit to matter and the god of evil. Salvation involved liberation from matter. The Church was concerned, almost from the beginning of her existence, to distinguish the Christian doctrine on creation from such views. Scripture seems quite clearly to teach that all of creation is good. Everything other than God is, for as long as it exists, held in being by God: ''Yet for us there is one God, the Father, from whom all things are and for whom we exist, and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things are and through whom we exist\" (1 Cor 8:6). \"For from him and through him and for him are all things\" (Rom 11:36).4 / The ancient professions of faith proclaim belief in God, who is Creator, \"of all things visible and invisible.\" Some of these professions make explicit the teaching that all creatures are good, 3 However, perhaps some people's notions of Satan approach this, inadvertently. See the Sacred Congregation on Divine Worship's decree in 1975, \"Les formes multiples des superstitions,\" translated in Austin Flannery, O.P., Vatican Collection, vol. 2, More Post-Conciliar Documents (Collegeville, Minn.: The Liturgical Press, 1982), 456ff. 4...",

Subject is not threatened by the big Other, it is not in danger of being overwhelmed and stifled by the big Other (in short, it is not a humanist agent trying to dominate ‘objective structures’ that determine it). Subject is constituted, it emerges at the site of the inconsistency of the big Other. In other words, it is through its own lack/inconsistency that structure (the big Other) is always-already subjectivized, and this abyss in the big Other also opens up the space for the subject to articulate its authentic desire. What is threatened by the digitalization of our daily lives is thus not our free subjectivity but the big Other itself, the agency of the symbolic order, in its ‘normal’ functioning: with digitalization, the big Other is no longer a virtual normative order, it becomes part of material reality.",

      "title": "Aggression: Its Relation To Desire and Self-Interest",
      "abstract": "Aggression continues to be a problematic, ill-defined concept for most contemporary analysts. Questions about the nature and origin of aggression remain unanswered. On the one hand, aggression is conceived of as an instinctual drive; on the other, it is thought to originate as an instrument of reaction to external sources of frustration and environmental failures to meet developmental needs. Aggression has also been dichotomized as either the benign activity of assertiveness, or the darker destructive force of hostility, believed by many to arise from separate motivational systems. There is a problem with the view of aggression as largely an ad hoc reaction to deprivation or other environmental shortcomings leading to disappointment and frustration. This view understates the importance of the original expansive demands for pleasurable satisfaction made by the individual upon the environment. Desire itself seems to be responsible for an inward vulnerability to external sources of disappointment and frustration, so that what is not desired cannot be effectively frustrated. Though the prototypical object of aggression is taken to be an external source of frustration, danger, and narcissistic injury, the mobilization of aggression more accurately reflects a susceptibility to the disturbing pressure of psychic stimuli that are the inner desire for satisfaction. Aggression contributes its force to various constructive or destructive purposes, from love to mastery to vengeance. Its most immediate aims, primarily narcissistic, are not concerned with the needs of others. Aggression also makes important contributions to maintaining psychic equilibrium, to the psychic organization's stake in instinctual gratification, to ego function, and to superego operation.",

      "abstract": "In the more highly developed religions there are five elements, which, though they often occur together, are quite distinct and should not be confused: orthodoxy, or correct belief; piety, or emotional response to the deity or the doctrines or the ritual or any two or all three; mysticism, or the sense of God's immediate presence; asceticism, or denial of the animal appetites; and ethics, or good human relations. It is essential to keep the distinctions in mind when dealing with the work of Catholic writers, most especially that of Joyce, for Joyce's exasperated awareness of them was one of the impelling motives of his work. For Catholics, “sin” is a generic term covering unorthodoxy, impiety, indulgence of the animal appetites, and bad human relations; in the lay mind the distinctions among them are liable to become blurred, with resulting confusion in the conduct of life. One of the purposes of the medieval manuals of the virtues and vices, such as Ayenbite of Inwyt, Piers Plowman , and Handlyng Synne , was to remind laymen of the distinctions and the hierarchy among sins as well as of their generic sinfulness. Ulysses too is, among other things, such a manual; one of its principal themes is Handling Sin, as this is achieved by Dedalus and Bloom, each in his own way; Ulysses accordingly adapts the material of Ayenbite somewhat as it does that of The Odyssey.",

Humans can easily take advantage of the grace and gifts bestowed on them, but humans must fulfill an obligation to their Lord. Human dignity in the sight of God is not measured by how high the rank, position, lineage or wealth. But what is measured by Allah is his piety. Humans in an Islamic perspective will still be born in a state of nature, namely holy, clean, free from all sins and have a tendency to accept religion, faith, and monotheism. Humans become good or bad is the result of educational and environmental factors, not their original character. Basically humans are born in a state of nature. This means that humans are born in an equally weak state even though they have great potential. But that doesn't mean that when a human is born, it's like a white or blank slate like John Lock said or helpless like a jabarian view. This is because humans have the potential in the form of certain tendencies related to their reasoning, mental, and psychic powers which are of different types and levels. The understanding of Islamic education experts on the nature of nature brings implications for the birth of the theory of nature in education. In the context of education, this theory becomes the basis for developing human nature. In this case, the educational process becomes important to improve its quality because it is one of the means that can develop the potentials that exist within humans in accordance with the nature of their creation which is in accordance with what is described in the Al-Qur'an and Hadith.",

He is unconscious, without heartbeats and breath, and with a flat-line electroencephalogram. NDE may include some of the following elements: Out of the body experiences or separation of consciousness from the physical body, increase in sensory perception and intense emotions, travel into or through a tunnel, encounter with a brilliant light and mystical beings, deceased relatives or friends, a sense of alteration in time and space, visualization of unworldly realms and a special knowledge, encounter with a barrier or boundary, and a return to the body, either voluntary or involuntary. The fact that children NDE are similar to adult NDE is an evidence that these experiences are real and not due to pre-existing beliefs, cultural influences or previous experiences in the present life. The characteristics of NDE are similar worldwide. No evidence supports the physiological, psychological, neurochemical, and neuroanatomical hypothesis proposed to explain the NDE. Multifactorial models, based on the combination of all of them (brain anoxia or hypoxia, release of serotonin, endorphins and ketamine-like compounds) have also been proposed. Although physiological, psychological, and socio-cultural factors could interact in the NDE, the hypothesis proposed consist essentially in unsupported speculations about what might be happening during the NDE.",

      "abstract": "From the introduction]Genuine novelty is the introduction and creation of new things, relations, and affections in the world.Human experience constantly confronts us with novelty, in surprising, intimate ways (spotting new freckles, a great cup of hot chocolate, budding flowers), and in more time-extended, sweeping ways (invention of the automobile, the Little Ice Age, the development of homo sapiens).And yet things are the same.The novel always contains what has already been as a component, but with some modification.Generically, all novelty is the outcome of some creative act, and all creative acts beget some novelty.Apart from this, the concept of novelty is not homogenous.There can be novel itemsindividual and unique things.There can be novel kinds: new sorts of things or states of affairs, new types of events.There can be novel problems and questions and concepts.All novelty involves a measure of unpredictability and a measure of breaking from the status quo.And novelty is a pervasive element of human experience.I want to take this aspect of human experience seriously when doing metaphysics; I do not want to make the world of human experience secondary to some ineffable realm.Because our experience is an aspect of the real world, an account of novelty must acknowledge that the novel things that emerge in the course of events are \"genuine.\"That is, they are metaphysically significant and ontologically real.I want to construct a metaphysic that accommodates pervasive change and novelty, one that accommodates radical novelty.This is, however, a drastic change from much contemporary metaphysical work.Often, the way change is dealt with metaphysically renders our most intimate interactions and feelings an unimportant component of reality (if it is a component at all).Thus the reworking of many fundamental notions is required in order to make sense of the ideas of 'change' and 'novelty.'One of these notions is 'possibility.'Commonly held notions of possibility, such as an existenceless form (a \"possible object\" -a plaid apple, for example), or possibility as a rearrangement of the elements of actuality (taking what actually exists and putting it in new combinations -horse + horn = unicorn), drain all significance from the notion of novelty.In this paper, I attempt to revise our notion of possibility using Bergson and Whitehead by creating a picture that does not entail \"possible objects,\" but allows for a creative actuality and radical novelty.This modified view of possibility will provide a basis for understanding higher and more complex and coordinated forms of novelty.[...",

The answer lies in the model of the life-space of the things. This space is created by two basic dimensions. The first is defined by the character of the relationships created by the objects (this dimension comprises the opposition between the technical relations versus the communicative ones). The second is defined by the character of the relationship between the body of the user and the material object (this is created by the opposition: accessible or inaccessible to sensory experience). The transition of the material object through this space is the life-way of the object, and it is precisely this which defines the longevity of the object and thus the length of time it persists within a specific community. The author determines that long-lasting objects are above all those which are linked with the community, or users, by single, unambiguous relationships and links, while those which have ambivalent and multiple links are of shorter lifespan. Whether or not a thing has a long life or not is determined therefore by the multiplicity of meanings it has which render impossible its role as a stabiliser of the links that constitute a community, as a foundation of the individual’s identity, a guarantee of ontological security.",

      "abstract": "There are enough glimmers of creativity in our lives. We've grown so used to them that we don't even pay attention to them anymore, or at least, we don't interpret them as such. And in the meantime, a skillful turn of phrase is artistic and creative; a well-timed and instinctive movement without any preparation - a jump, a fall, a blow - is art. We are not in control of all of these subconscious processes. Just like we don't control other functions: digestion, circulation. But just like these are quite real, so are our other psychological reserves. Naturally, someone who is capable of creating something great also has the ability to create lesser works, and someone who is capable of small feats can create something great under the right circumstances: paint a great painting, publish a book, play a difficult role. And there's no reason to regard creativity as anything other than one of the manifestations of life.",

      "title": "RELEVANCE OF INDIAN MYTHOLOGY IN THE PURSUIT OF EQUILIBRIUM: RECKONING THE IMPACT OF THE CHARACTER OF SHIVA ON THE CONTEMPORARY WORLD",
      "abstract": "Maintaining balance in the restless 21st century, where human beings have become multitaskers, is vital. Some do the double duty to earn the necessities, while others overwork to afford luxuries. Even children are loaded with the indulgence of multiple activities in their schedule. From the binaries of home and office in social life to mind and body in an individual self, balance is one of the indispensable factors for leading a vigorous and peaceful life. It brings stability and consistency, and a stable mind effectively gains knowledge. Balance of mind can be achieved via various means, such as doing sports, dancing, crafting, practicing meditation or mindfulness, and so on. Yoga is one such medium that not only increases the capacity to acquire knowledge more efficiently but is also beneficial in keeping a person mentally, emotionally, and physically healthy, boosting overall productivity. It is also helpful in relieving stress, which is common nowadays. Yoga is believed to have originated from Shiva, an Indian mythological character and widely worshipped god in India, as he is also known as Adiyogi, which means 'the first yogi'. While Yoga is a trend around the globe, it originated and resides in the core of ancient India. For a better understanding of yoga, it becomes essential to understand the Indian culture, mythology, and the knowledge it provides. This article deals with Yoga's impact on building a healthy physical and mental environment for acquiring knowledge and how the character of Shiva helps in bringing balancing in life.",

We, the professionals, set up artificial scenes, moving one or another of their parts, in order to put the child-in appropriate conditions or to induce one behaviour rather than another. It is through interactions between grown-up and baby that natural processes of language appropriation and though development fall into place. The different areas of child development are not partitioned, and interactions can be observed between motor, cognitive and linguistic development. The child's motor or psychomotor behaviour may sometimes be the expression of well-being, of feeling unwell, of a request, of a desire. Even with the average child, it is not always easy to decode these signals. With the deaf child, adults are sometimes so concerned with linguistics and audition that motor expressions tend to be assigned a lesser role. However, by observing the child as a whole, our actions can become more adequate and better targeted.",

      "abstract": "“When wealth is lost, nothing is lost; when health is lost, something is lost; when character is lost, all is lost”. Now the caption is very much pertinent in this present millennium under the context of Character Building for mankind when a greater part of this society used to run after name, fame, money and power even at the cost of own life. If one becomes determinate on the one aim of God realization, then man will turn towards God. On turning towards God, good qualities, good conduct come on their own, and character building begins to take place. However, if a man forgets about God realization and begins to hoard worldly possessions and enjoy sense pleasures, then he falls down in character. He, who loses his character, is not even worthy and deserving of being called a man. He himself is the central theme of building character. He is more valuable than any possession in the universe. In this context, Swami Vivekananda said that, “neither money pays, nor name, nor fame, nor learning; It is CHARACTER that can cleave through adamantine walls of difficulties.The purpose of education is ManMaking and Character building of the students. Defining character, Vivekananda said, “The character of any man is the aggregate of his tendencies, but the sum of the total bent of his mind. As pleasure and pain pass before his soul, they leave upon it different pictures and the result of these combined impressions is what is called a man’s character”. The present paper will try to shed some light on the character and character formation in the light of Swami Vivekananda.",

      "abstract": "Fear is a very strong stressor, and the highly variable results of handling and transportation studies are likely to be due to different levels of psychological stress. Psychological stress is fear stress. Some examples are restraint, contact with people, or exposure to novelty. In many different animals, stimulation of the amygdala with an implanted electrode triggers a complex pattern of behavior and autonomic responses that resemble fear in humans. Both previous experience and genetic factors affecting temperament will interact in complex ways to determine how fearful an animal may become when it is handled or transported. Cattle trained and habituated to a squeeze chute may have baseline cortisol levels and be behaviorally calm, whereas extensively reared animals may have elevated cortisol levels in the same squeeze chute. The squeeze chute is perceived as neutral and non-threatening to one animal; to another animal, the novelty of it may trigger intense fear. Novelty is a strong stressor when an animal is suddenly confronted with it. To accurately assess an animal's reaction, a combination of behavioral and physiological measurements will provide the best overall measurement of animal discomfort.",

Will any ofyour readers deny any ofdie following statements? 1.Almost all greyhounds can run faster than dachshunds; alsatians are more likely to bite you than great danes; spaniels are more sentimental than fox terriers; sheepdogs and foxhounds display an inherited capacity for dieir professions. But they can all interbreed, like the different races ofHomo sapiens. 2.Any characteristic ofa biological population follows a statistical distribution curve: size, speed, endurance, enterprise, a capacity for mathematics, music, or hunting, anything that can conceivably be measured. 3.These distribution curves are not usually the same for different characteristics or different populations. 4.In any human population a man with any particular intellectual, social, athletic, emotional, or adventurous capacity is trained by the company he keeps toward marrying a woman, or the sister of a man, with diat capacity. Thus groups arise with specially developed mental, social, and physical characteristics; and diese are inherited. 5.Inherited racial differences obviously exist in man in respect of physical qualities. It is hard to believe that intellectual, emotional, and social differences are not based on qualities inherent in the nervous system (reacting of course with social and physical environment) and so can be passed on by inheritance and modified by selection. The only alternative is to suppose that die Creator standardized his invention at the start and has not since let selection work. None of this implies that racial differences imply moral superiority. The strongest contender for die proposition that all men are equal would not claim diat all footballers are equal. It is not immoral to inquire why one footballer is better than another, or why men (on the average) can run faster than women. It is not wicked to ask whether diere are more, orfewer, potential poets ormathematicians amongAfrican childrendian among European ones, or whedier the poets ormadiematicians, when diey mature, will be radier different or kind. It takes all kinds to make a world; it would be a pity to insist, ifall men are not equal at everything, that the differences must be ironed out or hushed up. That seems to me dishonest.

      "abstract": "The works of the Lord are great;\" but we must not estimate this greatness by their actual dimensions ; else a man would be of less importance than a hippopotamus, and the Bass Bock would be immensely more valuable than either.It is a greatness not measurable by rule and line; not to be determined by bulk and weight ; it is to be estimated by far other qualities,by the relative importance which the objects bear to each other, by the variety and complexity of their parts, by the elaborateness with which they are constructed, by their fitness for the pur- poses which they are destined to subserve, and especially by the degree in which they shew forth the power, wisdom, skill, and goodness of Him who made them for His own glory.Many of the animals of which we are about to speak are so minute that the unassisted eye takes no cognisance of their presence ; yet most of these,perhaps all, if we were able to investigate them,-are so curiously fashioned, LIFE, SO elaborately constructed, as to deserve to be included in the category of those works which the adoring Psalmist says are great.We propose in this volume to describe the various phases of animal life, commencing at the foot of the scale, where we catch the first glimmering of the vital spark, and tracing it step by step upwards through its various developments and changes, its forms and functions.But what is LIFE ?There is a mystery couched under that little word which all the research of philosophers has not been able to solve.Science, with the experience of ages, with all the appliances of art, and with all the persevering inge- nuity and skill that could be brought to bear upon it, has ardently laboured to lift the veil; but philosophy, and .science,and art, stand abashed before the problem, and confess it a mysterj^still.The phenomena, the properties of life, are readily observable.We take a bird in our hands; a few moments ago it was full of energy and animation ; it shook its little wings as it hopped from perch to perch ; its eyes glanced brightly, and its throat quivered as it poured out the thrilling song which de- lighted us.Now the voice has ceased, the eye is dim, the limbs are stiffening, and we know that it will move no more.Chemical changes have already begun to operate upon its organs ; decomposition is doing its work, and soon the beautiful little bird will be a heap of dust.We say that its life has gone ; but what is it that has gone h If we put the body in the most delicate balance, it weighs not a grain less than when it was alive ; if we measure it, its dimensions are precisely the same ; the scalpel of the anatomist finds all the constituent parts that made the * Perhaps it would be most correct to consider a cilium as formed by tbo wall of a cell drawn out to a faio point. LIFE, IN ITS LOWER FORMS.marked {d).As the two divisions become more separate, each assumes an oval form, united at length to its fellow only at the base (e).At this time the motion of the cilia is plainly visible, forming a circle in each within the body, near the summit.As the process goes on, the con- nexion between the two is reduced to a mere point, and they become capable of separate motion, so far as to diverge and look in opposite directions ; the point of union being the common stem (/).At this stage w^e may observe that the bell which is destined to remain is open at the top, within which the ciliary waves are chas- ing each other in continuous wheels, the other bell being closed at the summit.But on the latter, which is ultimately to be thrown off, a new and highly interesting phenomenon appears.The cilia, which before the division had played around the mouth, have become obliterated, probably by absorption ; the orifice at that extremity has closed up permanently, for this is to be the base of the new animal ; and a new bell-mouth and a new wheel of cilia, are to be formed at the opposite end, which at present remains attached to the common stem.The first indication we can detect of this new formation is a very slight motion in the water, a little quivering around what we must as yet call the basal part.Presently there appear waved hairs, which seem very flexible, and the motion of which resembles that of a fringe of loose silk moved through water, an action very different from the regular waves of perfect cilia.These waving hairs increase rapidly in length, and in the vigour and rapidity of their undulations, which gradually become decidedly rotatory, producing at length strong currents in LIFE, IN ITS LOWER FORMS.fine granules, some larger globules, probably of oil (fat), a contractile sac anteriorly, and an elliptic discoid granular nucleus, often accompanied by another smaller, finely granular, discoid globule, well defined.\" The larger nucleus is the one destined to undergo the first change ; this it does by the development of fine cilia around its periphery, which actively vibrate, and so cause its rotation.Whilst this goes on, it increases in size, ad- vances towards the anterior of the Acineta, which takes on active contractions, and thereby ultimately ruptures its integument, allowing the embyro (ciliated nucleus) to escape.On its emergence, the embyro swims away rapidly by means of its cilia ; what further changes it undergoes are yet to be discovered.However, the part the Acineia body has to perform is not completed by the production of the one embryo ; but the same process has to be repeated again and again, until its formative granular mass is used up, when the Acineta becomes a contracted, shrivelled, empty sac, seated upon the persistent stalk.''After an emission of an embryo, the Acineta body contracts strongly ; some of its diverging fibres shorten, whilst others are entirely withdrawn.This contracted condition, after lasting for a time, relaxes; the Acineta resumes its usual movements ; the fibres spread out anew, moving about as usual in various directions ; and it finally regains its original characters, save that it is smaller, and, instead of a smooth, even surface, it has its tunic thrown into folds or undulations.The spot from whence the embyro escaped soon becomes imperceptible.\"*",

      "abstract": "Naturalism is a polemical term, and the polemic does not translate well into the terms of traditional Chinese thought. The universe is self-contained, without an external principle or source of unity. Different versions introduce further conditions, but naturalism is always a thought about immanence, and that gives people a point of entry into the Chinese material. The late Zhou dynasty was a time of crisis, climaxing with dynastic collapse. The crisis seriously challenged the idea of a heavenly approved political order. Immanence implies that what a thing is has no substantial, intrinsic determination or identity. Identity is instead a matter of relations in ramifying networks and process without end. The Confucian idea is that people cannot understand what a thing is without understanding its relation to others upon whose existence it depends, and which define the norm of its interaction. Dao is not an entity, not a being with a form, shape, or presence in the world or beyond it.",

      "title": "A whole world: the personal is the global",
      "abstract": "A truly holist worldview would indicate that indeed all personal actions and perceptions are experienced and interact in a logical way with a fully structured, interdependent world. Every personal action, feeling and thought is reflected and responded to in the ‘whole’. While the individual experience of such a world compares to living in a matrix and is encountered when sufficient perceptional capacity is present, this does indeed not indicate that everything which exists and is perceptionally experienced would be fictional or an illusion. Rather, all of these perceptions are (probably) real and true in their own way, even not intentionally related and meaningful, but for the experiencing individual they make an immediate meaningful sense where all things seem related and deeply meaningful. This perception of the world, for which I use the classical term ‘holist’, has been experienced by many individuals before. Scholars such as Jung, Freud, Plotinus and many others have discussed specific elements of it (three levels of consciousness, synchronicity, serendipity, unity of all, telepathy, etc. etc.). It is oftentimes encountered by people experiencing what we would usually call ‘altered perceptions’. Those might be incited by the use of substances or by spiritual practices or might even be found in what the Western world terms ‘mental illnesses’. Within this altered, but ultimately not entirely incorrect, worldview, causal or apparently causal relationships exist virtually everywhere. While in this worldview, our materialist causal knowledge does still make sense, in addition alternative knowledges such as provided by Eastern philosophy, para-sciences, mysticism, religion, also make sense. For example, such an individual might perceive meaning in numerology, while at the same time knowing with the same certainty, that the numbers read were not intended to provide a certain information when they were written. There seems to be a paradoxical tension between the Eastern and Western reality, between meaning and coincidence, rationality and irrationality. In fact, there is no real conflict between these two perceptions. Rather, when integrated, they can provide a new and potentially progressive and more meaningful understanding of our world and reality. This new worldview could, as one example of concrete holism, show concrete correlations between personal experiences and actions, and global effects.",

It becomes the job of the disciplinary discourse to normalize and contain this process, to draw off the element of risk and playfulness. It is the job of an analysis like this one to restage the drama and intimacy of these encounters, as a way of understanding better the nature of the discourse and the forms of knowledge that do and do not arise from it.

In order to find a universal criterion of respect, Sensen first distinguishes different usages of “respect,” such as “not using someone as a mere means,” “gaining another’s consent,” feeling esteem for someone, or being polite. Sensen argues that—while these usages are of central importance in our everyday life—they are not the universal respect that we always owe to all others. Rather, he argues, universal respect consists in not exalting oneself above others, which itself consists in not breaking rules that we regard as objectively necessary. The discovery of these necessary rules is largely an empirical matter that involves universal human needs, cultural norms, and giving others a voice in how they are treated. If one does not make an exception to these rules, one’s behavior is respectful toward all others.",

      "abstract": "Impartiality looks likely to help Adam and Eve on their way, since it detaches each from their own point of view. Yet it cannot simply be the detachment which gets Adam to think of all his states or selves, rather than those of the immediate moment, since his need to arbitrate between his earlier and later ones is unpuzzlingly for his own benefit. How he chooses among his present, earlier and later selves and whether he is to be identified with one, all or none of them are interesting questions. But, while nothing normative intrudes on the predictions of his present self about the actions of a later one, there is still a difference between two Adams and the relation of Adam to Eve. With Adam and Eve to think about and trust at issue, impartiality turns trickier. Although they have become more complex since the start, being by now two-tier agents able to reflect that their preferences are interfering with their interests, they need something more before they can rule against themselves and trust one another.",

      "abstract": "If we do not prefer to be isolated and act in roles not chosen by ourselves in the world outside games, neither shall we inside. This is exactly why counting-out rhymes were created. They clearly state who is to take the unpleasant role in the game, who is ‘IT’. No longer do they decide who should live or die like their ancestor, the decimation, but, similarly, they leave the decision to fate. Structurally, a counting rhyme is a bridge to the game, functionally, it is a problem-solving device. A part of the game scenario, which will disappear when the actual game starts. This study was written with the goal to analyse what is behind the counting rhyme. Is there anything behind it at all? Half a minute long mechanical activity or human relationship? Is it a mere declaration, a role assignment or a social event? Do its structure and thematic need understanding? Is its rhythm a form of gesticulation or control? Is its linguistic content only a pile of raw material or a string of transubstantiated words? A counting rhyme is not elevated, or a liar, or beautiful, or ugly, neither is it a moral guide. Sometimes it is not longer than two lines, but, like the greatest literary works, it is a form of text and activity which has dramaturgy, tension, humour. Sometimes it is unspeakably nonsensical, but ready to be used for a preschool child as the language of their archaic self-identity.",

      "abstract": "The rise of non‐representational theory in human geography has prompted searching questions about how researchers might ‘represent’ what they encounter in their fieldwork. A central problem is that we reach an insurmountable impasse, an aporia, because we cannot share thoughts, meanings, feelings, etc., in a manner faithful to our experience of them or equally that certain spectacular or horrific events and encounters escape their retelling. We argue that this impossibility should not become a warrant for withdrawing from the world, and instead propose that close descriptions can still be offered of particular encounters, attending in the process to the situated, embodied sense‐making work being (unavoidably) undertaken by the peoples involved that makes those encounters what they are. Such work may be threatened by scepticism, because it assumes the possibility of representation being at least partially successful, here and now, and relies on the ‘just‐thisness’ of things. Scholars of social life can, scepticism contained, learn much from taking seriously how any encounter unfolds without transcendental or structural guarantee in the immediacy of the life‐worlds where it is made and re‐made.",

      "abstract": "Part 1. There exists a minority of individuals who report that they have never, in their lifetimes, formed an extremely close personal and emotional relationship with another human being. Psychological research indicates that, compared with persons who report that they have at some time entered into such a relationship, these .non-close-relaters. tend to be more shy, more lacking in trust, more introverted and more lacking in social skills. In addition, non-closerelaters are less likely to believe in ESP or to report personal experience of paranormal phenomena; that is, they are more often than not intellectual and experiential .goats.. This paper explores a number of possible explanations. normal and paranormal.for this attitudinal difference: it is suggested that while ordinary psychological processes do play a r le, the difference can best be understood if one additionally postulates the bidirectional operation of the paranormal: in particular, it is proposed that certain .extraverted. personality types will manifest hitting, in order to further the development of desired relationships; while certain .introverted. personality types will miss, with the effect of reducing intimacy in their dealings with other people. If it is assumed that instances of .negative ESP. in everyday life usually fail to be recognized as constituting ESP, then this would account for the non-close-relater.s failure to report paranormal experiences. Part 2 explores possible instances of significant missing in everyday life. It is concluded that invocation of the paranormal hypothesis will enrich our understanding of the mechanisms of interpersonal interaction.",

Like all terrestrial species, humans move in a gravity field that permanently tends to induce postural destabilization through its attracting effect towards the centre of the Earth. In addition, movements themselves perturb our balance, and can be considered as a self-inflicted perturbation [1]. Alteration of the balance control system may therefore result in postural instability and increase the risk of falls with well-known associated morbid consequences (physical, psychological, social etc).",

To provide an insight, Chapter 6 investigates the plural, situational, and interpersonal ways in which people understand legitimate, or at least reasonable, access to taking in the hunting zone. Stealth, I argue, is less a matter of efficient hiding than of cultivating skills that allow blending in across different social and bureaucratic landscapes and greater access to their own acquisitive and status-related projects. I call these skills camouflage, in a nod to their hunter-like, non-pastoral tendencies. Camouflage is not just something state actors do in order to paper over the inconvenient or anomalous cases that might call attention to the limits of state ways of seeing. It is a skill that people develop in order to move in and out of institutional structures, a way to use those structures for their own gymnastic endeavours without drawing attention to the ways in which their practices cause the bars to creak or bend.",

Human beings engage in relatively little direct eye‐to‐eye contact. For humans and other animal species, eye behavior plays an important role in survival, reproduction, and building/maintaining social and role relationships. Being watched is as important as watching others. As the target of another's eye gaze, a person's performance is infused with significance – in either positive or negative ways. Because of its importance to human interaction, people are sensitive to the absence of gaze when it is expected and its presence when it is not. We often perceive eye‐to‐eye contact when the eyes are actually tracking many points around the area of the eyes.",

      "title": "The hidden structure of overimitation",
      "abstract": "Young children are surprisingly judicious imitators, but there are also times when their reproduction of others' actions appears strikingly illogical. For example, children who observe an adult inefficiently operating a novel object frequently engage in what we term overimitation , persistently reproducing the adult's unnecessary actions. Although children readily overimitate irrelevant actions that even chimpanzees ignore, this curious effect has previously attracted little interest; it has been assumed that children overimitate not for theoretically significant reasons, but rather as a purely social exercise. In this paper, however, we challenge this view, presenting evidence that overimitation reflects a more fundamental cognitive process. We show that children who observe an adult intentionally manipulating a novel object have a strong tendency to encode all of the adult's actions as causally meaningful, implicitly revising their causal understanding of the object accordingly. This automatic causal encoding process allows children to rapidly calibrate their causal beliefs about even the most opaque physical systems, but it also carries a cost. When some of the adult's purposeful actions are unnecessary—even transparently so—children are highly prone to mis-encoding them as causally significant. The resulting distortions in children's causal beliefs are the true cause of overimitation, a fact that makes the effect remarkably resistant to extinction. Despite countervailing task demands, time pressure, and even direct warnings, children are frequently unable to avoid reproducing the adult's irrelevant actions because they have already incorporated them into their representation of the target object's causal structure.",

Even though humans are not the only animalsl with this mental capacity, their ability to perform actions is accompanied by a feeling of authorship, a feeling that \"I\" am the one who did it. This is what academics have called the sense of agency. When individuals claim reduced responsibility because they were \"only obeying orders\", this defense is often viewed with skepticism, because the defendant has a clear motive of avoiding punishment. However, scientific methods can now be used to investigate the experience of receiving orders and how it influences how the brain processes information. As this chapter shows, obeying orders impacts the sense of agency and the feeling of responsibility at the brain level. Further, working and living in some highly hierarchical and sometimes coercive social structures, such as the military, can also impact the sense of agency when people make decisions. It thus appears that hierarchies provide a powerful ground to obtain a reduced feeling of responsibility and agency in individuals.",

VI., Sect. 2) that the sequence of the Thoughts and Feelings, when left to follow their own course by the suspension of the controlling power of the Will, may be determined by suggestions either from within or from without; that is, by the promptings of previous ideational states recorded in the Cerebrum, or by those of new sensorial impressions. In the former case, the attention is so engrossed by the objects which present themselves to the internal senses, that impressions made on the external are either not felt at all, or their meaning is not apprehended. But when the Mind is not following any definite direction of its own, one idea may be readily – substituted for another by new suggestions from without ; and thus the whole state of the convictions, the feelings, and the impulses to action, may be altered from time to time, without the least perception of the strangeness of the transition.—Such are the characteristics of the states known as Reverie and Abstraction; which are fundamentally the same in their character, though the form of their products differs with the temperament and previous habits of the individual, and with the degree in which his consciousness may remain open to external impressions,—Reverie being the automatic mental action of the Poet, Abstraction that of the Reasoner.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Much has been written on how individuals construct and maintain their identities through the stories they tell about themselves and the stories others tell about them. Often, but not always, there is enough convergence between these inner and outer stories not to cause significant conflict. However, it is also the case that certain identities are deemed more acceptable than others, and, while such acceptability may wax and wane for some identities, others remain very much marginalized and excluded. Such is the case of Other-than-human (OtH) identities—Otherkin, therians, vampires, and the like: How is it possible, and what does it mean, for an individual who is human in appearance and acting in the human world to self-identify as Otherkin—that is as an other-worldly, mythical, or fantastical creature such as an elf, dragon, or werewolf—or as therian (i.e., a this-worldly animal such as a dog, wolf, bear)? The visible disjunction between individuals’ experienced identities and the perceived reality of others raises hermeneutical issues. Following general reflections on narrative hermeneutics this chapter explores the process of “awakening”—the realization or coming to understand oneself as Otherkin or therian—and origin stories. The authors discuss OtH identities as “believed-in imaginings,” the limits of narrative acceptability, and how features of unnatural narratives might help in interpreting OtH identity narratives.",

      "title": "Non-Identity Theodicy",
      "abstract": "Abstract This chapter develops Non-Identity Theodicy—that is, theodicy primarily claiming that our existence as the individuals we are depends on God’s policy of evil and suffering allowance. Non-Identity Theodicy suggests that God allows evil in order to create and love the specific individuals who come to exist. This theodicy is unique because the justifying good recommended is neither harm-aversion nor pure benefit. It is not a good that betters the lives of individual human persons (for they would not exist otherwise), but it is the individual human persons themselves. In order to aim successfully at the creation of particular individuals, however, God would need a control of history so complete that it might be argued to be inconsistent with beliefs about human free will that are important to some theologies. In order to avoid this problem, a second version of Non-Identity Theodicy is constructed. This version considers whether God’s justifying motivation could be a desire for beings of our type, even if it could not be a desire for particular individuals. It is suggested that God would be interested in loving those he creates under various descriptions (e.g., biological, psychological, and narrative descriptions) and that a horror-prone environment is necessary for us to be the type of being we are under these descriptions. This second version of Non-Identity Theodicy allows some version of Non-Identity Theodicy to be available to the theist regardless of her views about the existence and nature of human free will.",

      "abstract": "To possess something is an unpredictable combination of the following: to have, to own, to know, or to control. Land, stories, resources, equanimity, and loyalty are all examples of materially incommensurate things a person might possess. Even without material wealth, for example, one might be said to be in possession of a wicked sense of humor or a good memory or despite all else, one's own life story. Possessing one's own life story, however, is not a given. Thinking of one's life as a story, as something that can be narrated, involves social processes and conventions operative well beyond individual processes of reflection or experience. Narrating one's life, then, is to situate oneself and to be situated in dialogue with society. 1 As such, whether one's narrative is consensual with or contradictory to social norms, such narration signals possession of shared structures of possibility, including normative understandings of history, memory, knowledge, and truth. To narrate one's life is not just an issue of how, but also a matter of if .",

      "title": "What Morality Is About",
      "abstract": "Abstract It seems obvious that the institution of morality is supposed to make people better off than they would otherwise be. When we try to say how we know that is true or what it means or what follows from it, however, the claim may begin to seem both dubious and trivial. A certain sort of relativist might question whether morality necessarily has anything to do with making people better off, or with any sort of outcome, on the grounds that what is morally right is at least in part a matter of what people in a community agree on, and people in a community might not agree to take one another’s well-being seriously. One might also deny that there are rights other than those granted by community agreements, or justice aside from adherence to community rules. I claim that morality does indeed characteristically make people better off, but not that being better off is a simple state or an individual matter, rather than one affected by one’s community, even one’s organization. The enterprise of business itself, quite aside from ethics, is supposed to make us better off than we would be without the fruits of the production it organizes.’ And so it normally does, occasionally in ways economists have not noticed. Sometimes, however, it surely does not, and that some business practice makes people worse off gives reason to believe that it is an immoral practice. Insofar as any institution makes people better off it is prima facie moral.",

I use the term “microdialogue,” rather than the more familiar notion of “internal conversation” or “society of mind,” to refer to a silent and invisible series of dialogues we hold for ourselves with the images and voices of others, which can emerge in surprising and unwilled ways. I suggest that this micro-dialogue is important in understanding the dialogical interactions between persons, as not all aspects of the self will enter into dialogue with others, leading to miscommunication, misunderstanding, and misrecognition. It is also possible for people to fail to articulate all the latent voices or vocal tones in their own micro-dialogue, leading to an understanding of how voices and selves can become divided and allowing us to take a different perspective on a dialogical unconscious.",

      "title": "Willa Cather's \"Consequences\" and &lt;i&gt;Alexander's Bridge&lt;/i&gt;: An approach through R. D. Laing and Ernest Becker",
      "abstract": "Willa Cather's \"Consequences\" and Alexander's Bridge:An approach through R. D. Laing and Ernest Becker Fritz Oehlschlaeger (bio) In his classic work of existential psychiatry, The Divided Self, R. D. Laing explores and defines a \"schizoid way of being-in-the-world\" characterized by what he calls \"ontological insecurity,\" a condition in which \"the individual in the ordinary circumstances of living may feel more unreal than real; in a literal sense more dead than alive; precariously differentiated from the rest of the world, so that his identity and autonomy are always in question\" (42). The ontologically insecure person may respond to the anxiety that becomes his constant condition by a splitting or division in the self. He seeks to protect his inner or true self, which comes to be experienced as \"transcendent\" or \"disembodied,\" by developing a \"false self system\" (73) whose job it is to confront and manage reality. Moreover, there is in the ontologically insecure person \"a failure to sustain a sense of one's own being without the presence of other people. It is a failure to be by oneself, a failure to exist alone\" (52). Such dependence on others for one's identity, however, threatens the self with engulfment, with \"complete loss of being or absorption into the other\" [End Page 191] (44), and thus the ontologically insecure person frequently retreats into utter isolation. For him the poles of existence cease to be separateness and relatedness, for these are based upon a firm sense of one's own autonomy. Instead, he is torn \"between complete isolation or complete merging of identity . . . each equally unfeasible\" (53). Laing's description of ontological insecurity provides an extraordinarily useful set of concepts with which to approach two of Willa Cather's studies of anxiety and psychic division, the 1912 novel Alexander's Bridge and the 1915 short story \"Consequences,\" which shares many of the novel's motifs.1 \"Consequences\" is the story of a young man's being driven to suicide by his double, an alter-ego or projection of himself as an old man. Its hero, Keir Cavenaugh, is completely dependent on others for his identity. Indeed what one of Laing's patients said of himself could easily have been said by Cavenaugh: \"Other people supply me with my existence\" (52). Alexander's Bridge, of course, is the story of an engineer, Bartley Alexander, who undergoes a comprehensive splitting of his personality at midlife. After Bartley renews his relationship with Hilda Burgoyne, his becomes clearly a \"schizoid way of being-in-the-world.\" Why Bartley becomes thus divided can be illuminated dramatically by looking at his experience from a perspective supplied by Laing and by the related work of Ernest Becker. To define the nature and sources of Bartley's fragmentation and to allow \"Consequences\" and Alexander's Bridge to shed light on one another will be my purpose here. Keir Cavenaugh is the thirty-two-year-old son of \"a Pennsylvania preacher, who died soon after he discovered that his ancestral acres were full of petroleum\" (71). Cavenaugh has come to New York, where the story is set, to enjoy his fortune, which he does by lavishly entertaining others. But entertaining is not simply a pastime for Cavenaugh; it is the means by which he sustains his precarious sense of identity: His motor hit the Park every morning as if it were the first time ever. He took people out to supper every night. He went from restaurant to restaurant, sometimes to half-a-dozen in an evening. The head waiters were his hosts and their cordiality made him happy. They meide a life-line for him up Broadway and from Fifth Avenue. (71) Cavenaugh soon comes to be pursued, however, by an old man of decayed and shaby gentility. This figure seems to have an independent existence, but he is also clearly Cavenaugh's double, an alter-ego or projection of Cavenaugh himself as an old man. He appears only to Cavenaugh, and Cather is careful to leave ambiguous the problem of his corporeality. What [End Page 192] seems especially to disturb the old man is a photograph of Cavenaugh's twin brother Brian, who...",

The normative question of importance to Aristotle, as well as for the rest of Greek ethics, is not whether we should pursue happiness, but rather what happiness consists in.

      "abstract": "AbstractConcept of Supreme Being is as old as the human history itself. But the idea of entity and attributes of that Being varies from culture to culture and religion to religion. Islam gives very vivid image of God, namely Allah in terms of His entity, attributes, and nature of relationships with the creature, including man. The Arabic word Allah denotes in English “The God”. He is Only One without any partner. He is totally unseen. He is the Creator, Sustainer, Provider, Controller of the entire universe. All that is in the earth and heavens belong to Him. Nothing is unto like Him. His power is infinite. He is as close to man as his jugular vein. He is the Most-Merciful, the Most-Beneficent. He is eternal with no beginning and end. He interacts with man and communicates to him every moment. He is Just and loves those who subscribe to justice. He has forbidden injustice for Himself as well as for man. He is Generous and commands man to interact with others generously. In order to be close to Him man has to be as kind to others as to his own self. The qualities Allah wants to see in man include sincerity, honesty, truthfulness, trustworthiness, justice, generosity, altruism, tolerance, forbearance, and fortitude. This paper deals with all these dimensions of “The God” from Islamic perspective as available in the Qur’an and the Prophetic traditions.Keywords: God, Allah, Entity, Attribute, the Qur’an, Islam.AbstrakKonsep Yang Maha Esa setua sejarah manusia itu sendiri. Tetapi idea entiti dan sifat-sifat-Nya berbeza dari budaya ke budaya dan agama ke agama. Islam memberikan imej yang sangat jelas mengenai tuhan, yaitu Allah dari segi entiti-Nya, sifat-sifat-Nya, dan perhubungan-Nya dengan makhluk, termasuk manusia. Perkataan Bahasa Arab yaitu Allah, dalam bahasa Inggerisnya menandakan “Tuhan”. Yang Hanya Satu tanpa penolong. Yang benar-benar Tersembunyi. Yang Maha Pencipta, Pemelihara, Pembekal, Pengawal seluruh alam semesta. Segala yang ada di bumi, dan langit adalah kepunyaan-Nya. Tidak ada yang sama seperti-Nya. Kuasa-Nya adalah tidak terbatas. Yang lebih dekat dengan manusia daripada urat lehernya. Yang Maha Pemurah, Yang Maha-Pengasihani. Yang kekal tanpa awal dan akhir. Yang berinteraksi dengan manusia pada setiap masa. Yang adil dan mengasihi orang-orang yang menegapkan keadilan. Yang mengharamkan kezaliman atas diri-Nya dan juga untuk manusia. Yang Maha Mulia dan memerintah hamba-Nya untuk berinteraksi dengan orang lain dengan sebaik-baiknya. Dalam usaha untuk rapatkan diri kepada-Nya, manusia mesti berbuat baik kepada yang lain seperti keatas dirinya. Sifat-sifat yang Allah mahu melihat dalam manusia adalah keikhlasan, kejujuran, kebenaran, amanah, keadilan, kemuliaan, pemurah, toleransi, kesabaran, dan ketabahan.

      "title": "Containing Multitudes: Reflection, Expertise and Persons as Groups",
      "abstract": "From time to time, philosophers like to raise the possibility of the existence of group minds or group persons. In order for something to be interestingly and appropriately described as a group person it must satisfy two conditions. First, it must itself exhibit various characteristics that are distinctive of persons. Unless it did this, it would not be a group person. Secondly, it must be composed of entities that are themselves persons or relevantly person-like. Without this, it would not be a group person. It is the difficulty of seeing how these two conditions can be satisfied together that has made the existence and possible natures of group persons problematic. For the things that paradigmatically satisfy the first condition, namely persons, are not obviously thought of as being composed of person-like entities related in some group-like way. And the things that paradigmatically satisfy the second condition, such as sports teams, committees and string quartets, are not obviously thought of as themselves displaying personal characteristics. Investigators of group persons – though not always thinking of themselves as such – have usually approached the problem by starting with paradigmatic and uncontroversial groups and exploring the extent to which personal characteristics can be attributed to them. Since it would be unreasonable to expect such groups to exhibit, even in some possibly attenuated way, all the characteristics of an ordinary person, attention is usually directed to some subset of these characteristics. Can such a group have a single consciousness? Can it be the subject of intentional mental states like belief? Can it act? Can it be guilty?",

One possibility is that these gestures are just conditioned responses without any understanding of the socio-cognitive causality underlying their efficacy. A second possibility is that they do involve some understanding of how they are (or fail to be) effective upon the behaviour of others. Observational evidence suggest that most apes and some monkeys coordinate their request gestures with joint attention behaviours — a criterion for early referential communication in human infants. However, experimental evidence about apes and monkeys‘ understanding of the causal role of joint attention in gestural communication is equivocal, with test pass and failure patterns that can be due to cognitive and/or motivational factors. Current evidence suggests that the gestures of apes and monkeys can neither be dismissed as simple conditioned responses nor be uncritically accepted as fully equivalent to human gestures.",

      "title": "When Less is More: Cultivating a Community in Relationship with God",
      "abstract": "What does it look like to cultivate a community in right relationship with God? In taking the focus off individual members and placing it on the community itself, we recognize that the whole of a university is greater than the sum of its parts, and that individual parts are repeatedly and continually shaped and defined by the whole. Being in right relationship with God begins with acknowledging our longings to be loved, to be known, and to belong in ways encouraging us to put ourselves intentionally and consistently in God’s gaze of love. Coming before God empty-handed and agenda-less, rather than starting another discipleship program or Bible Study, helps us lean into God’s love already at work—common grace. Gratitude flows from opening our eyes to the wonder of God’s sustaining love active around us. As we gaze at God, who is gazing at us, we are transformed—saved from envy, pettiness, selfishness, and sense of entitlement. Transformation begins with grace, where the response is a gratitude that moves back to God and is expressed in love of neighbor—love of all created things, both seen and unseen, held together by Christ. This movement of God in our college communities is cultivated by a shared identity as a Christian community, by seeing and knowing each other, being seen and known, using chapel as a Holy Place, and turning our love outward.",

      "abstract": "Actors at the wealth–power nexus—oligarchs, cronies, plutocrats, and the like—have become increasingly consequential in the global economic, political, and organizational landscapes. Yet, we know little about them, especially the processes by which they gain wealth or power, and then transform one into the other. I suggest that one reason for our limited understanding is that we are prisoners of Aristotle’s conceptualization of them as groups. To break out of that prison, a turn to the individual level seems warranted. This turn opens up new theoretical perspectives that focus on individuals and their processes, including effectuation, process research, biology and neuroscience, and arts and literature. These perspectives put individual-level processes front and center in the uncertain contexts in which these actors create and transform wealth and power.",

Instead, I’ll just sketch some problems I’ve been thinking about, all of which circle around the theme of boundaries in organism-environment systems. For reasons that will become evident, in addressing the developmental systems framework I speak only for myself. The friends and neighbors of my title are obviously theoretical ones. They are so not so much different groups—the categories certainly overlap—as they are different aspects of our collegial relationships. Friends should be understood as enemies of my enemy, those with whom we make common cause. They are by our side at some scholarly barricade or other, perhaps engaging in the critiques of biological or social determinism that were part of my own academic development, or more recently of a variety of genecentrisms, adaptationism, representationalism, or the dominant strains of evolutionary psychology. 1 Such friends and allies tend to encounter each other on panels, in edited volumes, at workshops; on the page they often line up in the same citation-laden parentheses.

However, the cooperation needed to produce public goods is vulnerable to exploitation by free-riders &amp;mdash; the Tragedy of the Commons. The dominant solution to this problem of collective action is that some form of positive assortment (due to kinship or spatial structure) or of enforcement (reward and punishment) is necessary for public-goods cooperation to evolve. However, these solutions are only needed when individual contributions to the public good accrue linearly, and the assumption of linearity is never true in biology. We explain how cooperation for nonlinearpublic goods is maintained endogenously and does not require positive assortment or enforcement, and we review the considerable empirical evidence for the existence and maintenance of nonlinear public goods in biology. We argue that it is time to move beyond discussions about assortment and enforcement in the study of cooperation in biology.",

      "title": "Hearing Voices and Other Matters of the Mind",
      "abstract": "Abstract This book endorses an ecumenical naturalism toward all cognition, which will illuminate the long-recognized and striking similarities between features of mental disorders and features of religions. The authors emphasize underlying cognitive continuities between familiar features of religiosity, of mental disorders, and of everyday thinking and action. They contend that much religious thought and behavior can be explained in terms of the cultural activation of maturationally natural cognitive systems, which address fundamental problems of human survival, encompassing such capacities as hazard precautions, agency detection, language processing, and theory of mind. The associated skills are not taught and appear independent of general intelligence. Religions’ representations cue such systems’ operations. The authors hypothesize that in doing so they sometimes elicit responses that mimic features of cognition and conduct associated with mental disorders. Both in schizophrenia and in religions some people hear alien voices. The inability of depressed participants to communicate with or sense their religions’ powerful, caring gods can exacerbate their depression. Often religions can domesticate the concerns and compulsions of people with OCD. Religions’ rituals and pronouncements about moral thought-action fusion can temporarily evoke similar obsessions and compulsions in the general population. A chapter is devoted to each of these and to the exception that proves the rule. The authors argue that if autistic spectrum disorder involves theory-of mind-deficits, then people with ASD will lack intuitive insight and find inferences with many religious representations challenging. Ecumenical naturalism’s approach to mental abnormalities and religiosity promises both explanatory and therapeutic understanding.",

      "abstract": "Ernest Becker highlights the experience-limiting function of culture. Without such restriction, life, in all of its mystery and terror, is just too much for the self-conscious animal to bear. Culture has developed as a result of a need to minimize the force of life and anxiety associated with the inevitability of death. Successfully socialized individuals can envelop themselves in a death-denying and life-directing and limiting symbolic order. The set of symptoms we think of as schizophrenia are, on the one hand, associated with an inability to link up with the experience-managing, death-anxiety buffering, cultural order, and on the other, with the tendency to remain split off from the body. Individuals with the diagnosis of schizophrenia often do not rely on repression to manage their experience, but instead on the insufficient defense of dissociation. The paradoxical result of the dissociative defense is an overwhelming and terrifying experience. Successful psychotherapy involves helping the fearful, traumatized and interpersonally distant patient tolerate and even welcome body and affect. The attachment with the psychotherapist unblocks affect through an undoing of dissociative processes and a linking of the patient with the consensual, repression-based, symbolic order.",

      "abstract": "Not the least of the merits of the following discussion, while the author makes no claim of being a specialist in psychology, is his appreciation of the bearing of psychology upon his subject The point of view and the method of approach adopted by the psychologist bring to light material that may be obtained in no other way.And no safe theological structure can be built without this material.The child-mind and the child-life have their own secrets to tell, and they only learn these who patiently ask what the facts are, and not what the facts ought to be.But in these chapters there is more serious vu viii ciety.Parents who fail at this point, whatever they may have amassed or achieved, have failed in the one thing where failure is irretrievable.In these later years the psychologist has pro- ORIGINS even from our consciousness.This monstrous barnacle is not of the essence of our faith.It must be as offensive to God as it is to truth.It was the view of Schopenhauer that the \"essential element in human nature, and finally in the whole of reality, consists in a mysterious impulse toward life, a blind restlessly struggling will wholly unguided of reason. . . .In nature intelligence yields place entirely to this vital impulsion; such knowledge as is here devel- oped merely subserves the interests of self-pres- ervation.' ' ( Eucken : ' l Problem of Human Life, ' ' 511.)This will or impulse of Schopenhauer may be compared to what Augustin called sin in human nature.Schopenhauer regarded existence as a calamity.If Augustin had frankly taken theORIGINS 23 connection were broken or its influence counter- acted.\"(\"Mission and Expansion of Christian- ity,\" I, 32.)We thus see that the later deduc- tions concerning the sin inherent in the flesh, which are noted in Augustin 's teaching and since, may have been a contribution of Oriental myth- ical thought, brought under the formative power of Hellenizing thought something read into Christianity, and not a just product of it.Augustin thought of sin as something phys- ical, something inhering in the flesh, and did not confine it to the will and the moral nature.To him a \"movement\" of the flesh could be a sin, even when that \"movement\" was subjugated by the will and denied gratification.This is as absurd as to affirm sin of the animals of the field or the interaction of chemical forces.** While Augustin has stated more explicitly than any other the doctrine of the medieval Church concerning the evil nature of the \"movements\" of the flesh, yet there is evidence that his belief far antedated him.It can hardly be traced to the Jews in the form in which he held it, for they have a saying in the Talmud which reflects a different sontiment.It says: \"These four are reckoned as dead the blind, the leper, the poor, and the childless.\"But the sentiment was so strong in the time of Origen, who lived from 185-254 A. D., that in his youth in his aspiration for purity he mutilated himself for the Kingdom of Heaven's sake. (Eusebius H. E., vi, 8.) If any of the fathers of the Church deserves to be styled the \"greatest of the fathers,\" it was this Origen, undoubt- edly the most learned of them all.The volumes that he wrote are said to have been numbered in the thousands, and his impress on the Church has never perished.Meanwhile the doctrines of virginity and celibacy grew apace and the foundations of marriage were undermined, leading to the greatest crimes and scandals that ever disgraced the Christian Church.For many centuries marriage was regarded as a purely civil contract, and in that form bitterly assailed by the Church fathers.Chastity was preached not because it was a good thing in itself, but because man's fall and the necessity for his redemption was traced to an indiscretion committed in the Garden of Eden.All intercourse between the sexes was discountenanced; to have children under any cir- cumstances was a sin.Young people were enjoined to enter into vows of celibacy, and multitudes of them did so.Marriage was regarded as evil and vicious.Decrees were made forbidding married women to approach the altar or to touch the Eucharist, and it was even declared to be doubtful whether married persons cohabiting with each other * Luther in his commentary on Galatians says: \"And this (no doubt) all the proph- ets did foresee in spirit, that Christ should become the greatest transgressor, murderer, adulterer, thief, rebel, and blasphemer that ever was or could be in all the world.For ORIGINS 37 ascetic tendency appeared in the Christian Church at a later period than the narratives of the birth of Jesus.If it had had any connection with the origin of these narratives it would have been at pains so to tell the story as to put Mary's per- petual virginity beyond doubt or question, whereas the impression conveyed in the Gospels is that after the birth of Jesus, Mary lived with Joseph in wedlock.It is now generally agreed that the stories of the infancy are of undoubtedly Jewish origin, and in Judaism marriage was not depreciated, but regarded as honorable.'*It is evident from the reasoning of certain authors that this matter of the virgin birth has something to do with the sinlessness of Jesus.It may be that that is its real if not entire signifi- cance in their minds.To quote again from Gar- vie, who may stand for many others who thus reason.He says (op. cit.98) : \"It is also certain that there is no other human personality, except Jesus, in which a hereditary tendency to sin and distrust has not appeared.It is a fact beyond",

the organs of secretion, as the glands.These are connected with the sympathetic nerves, which spring from the « cerebrum », the fore part of the head.The digestive, respirator}', and reproductive organs, with the fat, milk, and other animal products, belong to this class.The mental organs : the eyes, the ears ; the organs of perception, and the organs of volition.The functions of the firsc are to receive impressions from without ; of the second, to perceive, compare, reflect of the third to will, and, consequently, to throw the muscles into action to fulfil its purpose.Now, the grand purpose of these inquiries is to determine whether or not one parent, or both indiscriminately, impart their organisation to the offspring.And it is to this point that, in spite of its want of attractiveness, we should turn our earnest attention, for it is owing to the indifference with which it has been so long regarded that breeding has been so uncertain an undertakino^.injudicious course of in-and-in breeding, all desire seems to be wanting in the male.Suppose the case of a bull breeding with his daughter and again with his grand daughter.Now, he gives, let us say, the anterior orgfans to his daugfhter, thus the two animals become, so far, identical ; but, in breeding with his daughter, he may give his posterior organs to his grand daughter; and, as the grand daughter will thus bear both his series of organs -the former from the mother, the latter from himself-it is evident that, as regards these organs, the two are perfectly iden- tical, and the identity of the mental organs destroys all desire for reproduction, the differences which are essential to excitement having no existence.But, although some of our early improvers were as we have said, obliged, from the nature of the case, to tread a dangerous path, this is no longer the prac.tice of our great breeders.They all have lines of blood, families, of relations it is true, but sufficiently far removed to be matched without fear of the conse- quences.And it is fortunate for all of us that it is so, for in no other way could the improvement made of late years by crossing have been carried out.The effect of adhering tenaciously to a particular family, or line of blood, has been to confer on the male a peculiarly impressive power, by which his form and le- sion on account of the increased size of the brain of the improved offspring.I have bred, in cattle, sheep and horses, from all sorts of males, and never found any difficulty on this score, but I have found that where a thoroughbred male of good form has been put to a rough country-bred mare, the progeny was invariably far superior to the dam in all outward parts, and that the rugged healthiness of the dam, with her abundant flow of milk gave her plenty of strength to bring forth and to sustain her better bred foal afterwards.Look, for instance, at the modern Exmoon ponies.Seventy or eighty years ago, they were little creatures from ten to twelve hands high, with nothing but their constitution and hardiness to recommend them.Now, crossed as they have been with full- sized, thoroughbred stallions, a more perfect type of pony for a lady's phaeton cannot be found, and they have so increased in height that many of them run from 14 to 14^h ands.Again ; I have used Shorthorn bulls of such size and weight on small country cows that the latter could barely support the weight of the bull at service, and the parturition of the calf was never attended by any evil consequence more than is usual in an ordinar}' herd.Once more ; I have coupled the small refined type of Southdown ewes with the heavy Hampshire- down ram, and, although the head of the Hampshiredown was in those days disproportionately large, the lambing was got through with much as usual.And here I must mention, as an instance of the efifect of crossing, the creation of the Babraham flock of Southdowns, premising that what I am about to state is merely an opinion, I formed purely from my own judgment, without the slightest evidence, material or otherwise, to go upon.The original progenitors of this most beautiful collection of sheep were brought, somewhere about 65 years ago, from Glynde, Sussex, the well known abode of the celebrated Mr. Elhnan, one of the first great breeders of the Southdown.They were elegant, deer-like creatures, with narrow chests, light fore- quarters, good, though of course .small,legs of mutton, and good loins.They « went to fold » every night on the fallows, on the breezy downs looking over the sea.We shall hear more about this folding system later.Seldom killed before three years old, their weight, when fat, varied from 14 to 16 pounds the quarter.To this very day, the highest prices quoted in the papers for mutton in the great London market is for Southdowns ; from 60 to 64 lbs.carcass, i. e., 15 to 16 ft)s the quarter.What the flavour of the meat of these small sheep was, those who have been so fortunate as to taste the saddle of a three or a four year old Southdown wether will recall with pleasure : such meat is not to be met with now-a-days, as it would not pay to keep sheep to that age.From this flock of Mr. EUman, Mr. Jonas Webb selected a few ewes and a ram which he took with him to a small farm in Cambridgeshire, belonging to Mr. Adeane, of Babraham, whose game-keeper, Mr. Webb was at that time.What the subsequent treatment of the flock was, nobody, I believe, ever knew, but it was most successful ; as the wethers at 20 months old often weighed from 22 to 26 pounds a quarter, and yet retained all the quality of the parent stock as regards meat and wool, while the bosom was enlarged, the neck strengthened, and the wool much improved.Of course, the better keep of the Cambridgeshire farm must have had an immense influence on the growth of the animal, for no doubt the small size of the Sussex sheep in its native county is, in great measure, due to the absurd practice of the flockmasters of that county of sending not so long as the wool of the Lincoln, but, there is no doubt of its having been employed in the re- moulding of the other long-wools.iVs far back as 1668, Markham, writing of the sheep of the English '' \" ''",

      "abstract": "It can be assumed that the semantic history of the term in the Western culture, on the whole, can be divided into two major periods: the period until the medieval times in which people worshipped the immutable supernatural as superior to the mutable nature; and the period since the Renaissance in which nature has been perceived as the disenchanted material to be used by the human. Through the history of Western ideas, the concept of nature tends to be categorized as the Other that is inherently inferior to both the supernatural and the human. In the Eastern culture, human beings are believed to be positioned within nature, not outside it, and they are participating, actively or passively, in the continuous flow of dynamic energy. Thus, the concept of the inhuman nature as the raw material to be exploited by human beings for their own benefit is not compatible with the traditional (or pre-modem) Eastern mode of thought based on religious veneration of nature. To regard humanity as a product of nature, not as a dominating subject of the objectified nature, is one of the major characteristics of the ecocentric ethics. The nature/culture dualism, which should be regarded as an ideological (that is, cultural) conceptualization in the West, is not universal or cross-cultural. The culture/nature dualism is being most seriously criticized by cultural holists including ecofeminists. In this essay, I attempted to understand the main ideas inherent in cultural holism whose primary concern is to promote the ecocentric ethics through critical interrogations of the Western ideology embedded in the nature/culture dualism.",

Zhong is positive, doing something for the self and then doing something for others. Shu is negative, thinking about what one should not do to others when one takes oneself as a measure for them.

Since, indeed, religion is a part of the struggle for the preservation and perfection of life, it involves from the very beginning emotional states. But to speak of religion as originating in emotions is to assume a conception of religion which seems to me utterly unacceptable. If any sentiment or emotion, such as reverence or fear or awe, is found at the dawn of religion, it exists as part of the response, in a particular situation, to a sense of the presence of an invisible Being, upon whom one depends and with whom one desires to hold satisfactory relations. The emotion belongs to an experience involving the whole man, that is, man as a feeling, thinking, willing being.",

      "title": "The dynamics of a usage-based approach",
      "abstract": "This contribution seeks to connect usage based linguistics with dynamic systems theory, in particular as applied by Edelman (1989) and Thelen and Smith (1994). Edelman’s dynamic biological system starts off with a few simple sub-systems (perception, action, value), all of which interacting with each other over time, that give rise to perceptual categorization and higher order thinking and behavior through interaction with other humans and the environment. As Thelen and Smith argue, humans may be genetically predisposed to certain behavior, but they can develop only through actual experience. If we accept such a dynamic view of development, the idea of predetermined development in step-like stages makes no sense. There are stages in that some sub-systems will have to develop and be coordinated before those of a higher level can be reached (also called a precursor relation), but the pathway is not neatly paved for the child: the child needs to learn through his own experience with lots of ups and downs and development is individually owned. Like other complex adaptive systems, a human infant is made up of numerous interconnected subsystems at different levels, which have a tendency to self-organize and therefore will show nonlinear patterns of development. The benefit of taking a dynamic perspective on human development is that naturally feeds into a usage based view of language development: human cognition and experience are intricately related with the way language has emerged and used.",

      "abstract": "Design has a central role in the creation of longer user product relationships. Thus far, however, sustainable design methodologies have attended almost exclusively to the somewhat superficial, bodily survival of manufactured objects, to after-effects rather than causes. Durability is as much about emotion, love and attachment as it is about fractured polymers, worn gaskets or blown circuitry. There is little point designing physical durability into goods if consumers lack the desire to keep them. The scope and power of emotional experiences delivered via objects produced through the current system are incredibly limited. Their ability to support and mediate evolving narrative experiences are weak. Commercially viable strategies are needed for emotionally durable objects which engage users on deeper and more profound levels, delivering intense and sophisticated experiences that penetrate the user psyche over longer, more rewarding, periods of time. New, alternative genres of objects could increase the durability of relationships between users and products, people and things. This will demand novel and provocative models of sustainable design capable of developing emotionally durable objects and empowering consumers to transcend the superficial urgencies of conventional consumerism and forge deep emotive connections with their possessions.",

      "title": "How we value animals: the psychology of speciesism",
      "abstract": "In this thesis, consisting of three empirical projects (18 studies, total N = 8,218), I investigate how people morally value animals and why they value them less than humans. My central hypothesis is that people primarily value animals less than humans because of their mere species-membership, i.e. due to speciesism. First, I develop and validate a Speciesism Scale, a psychological assessment instrument that measures the extent to which people value humans more than animals. I find that speciesism is a stable construct with large interpersonal differences. It shares psychological properties with other forms of prejudice and predicts behaviour directed towards animals. Second, I experimentally investigate in more detail why people endorse speciesism. I develop a multi-factorial framework according to which people: a) believe that individuals should prioritise members of their owns species over others (Species-Relativism); b) have a slight tendency to consider humans to be of superior value in an absolute sense (Pro-Human Bias); and c) have a specific bias against animals (Anti-Animal Bias). I also show that people value animals less, the lower their perceived mental capacity levels are (Individual Mental Capacity View)—a principle that people selectively apply to animals but not to humans. Third, I experimentally investigate when people consider it permissible to harm animals or humans in cases where harming a few could save many. My findings support a model which I call Multi-level Weighted Deontology: deontological protections against harm are not absolute and get weaker the less people value the respective being, but they do not completely disappear. They are strongest for humans, followed by dogs, chimpanzees, pigs, and finally inanimate objects. Overall, my research shows that speciesism is a pervasive psychological phenomenon that strongly impacts our social lives and moral thinking. This thesis is one of the first attempts to transition speciesism from moral philosophy into psychology.",

      "title": "Repetition, Pattern, and the Domestic: Notes on the Relationship between Pattern and Home-making",
      "abstract": "AbstractRepetition constitutes the very essence of pattern. Repetition is also the basis of our most ordinary actions. Repetitive gestures are usually so integrated in our lives that we tend to take them for granted. It is only when repetition is excessive or absent that we become aware of its importance to us. Not least because of their everyday properties, pattern and repetition are also closely related to the domain of the domestic. On the one hand, patterned artifacts, such as wallpapers, rugs, latticed curtains, and other fabrics seem to operate naturally as signifiers of an idea of domesticity, denoting privacy, comfort and, eventually, also seclusion and confinement. On the other hand, the repetitive rituals of pattern fabrication bear strong resonance with the traditional routines of household maintenance—cleaning, sorting, laundering, and so on. Not only are both dependent on a logic of continuous reiteration, but they also tend to be considered equally mindless and prosaic, as their processes are often rated inferior in comparison to less repetitive forms of production. In “Repetition, Pattern, and the Domestic” I investigate the foundations and implications of the identification between pattern and the home, drawing on material from historical, mythological, and psychological sources. This investigation aims to show how the repetitive mechanisms of pattern-making integrate the very dynamics of inhabitation, being essentially entangled, if sometimes inconspicuously, with the practice of spatial design.Keywords: patternrepetitiondomesticityspatial design",

      "abstract": "What is it for one thing to affect or to act on another? Examples come to mind: bending a bar of iron, moving a ball, melting wax. But there are other relationships one can have with an iron bar: one can also look at it, think about it, want it, approach it. Are not these too kinds of doing to it? We might say: even thinking about something is treating it in a certain way. Yet we should hardly admit that thought, sight, desire, and approaching affect or act on their objects. If we want to say that these are ways of treating things, then we have to say that not all cases of treating things are cases of affecting them. To put it in the formal mode: not every transitive verb ‘φ’, i.e. not every verb ‘φ’ with active and passive voices, is such that ‘x φs y’ entails ‘x acts on or affects y’. Let us call the values of ‘φ’ for which this entailment does hold, affective verbs, and those for which it does not, non-affective. Now the question of this paper is: what are the logical characteristics of affective, as opposed to non-affective, verbs? Or to put it in the material mode, using the term ‘operation’ neutrally: what are the logical characteristics of affective as opposed to non-affective operations?",

The present paper argues that it is valuable for your conduct in such circumstances to be regulated by a character trait the possession of which constitutes one way of having one’s life be centered upon others as opposed to centered upon oneself. The trait in question, which we shall call “others-centeredness,” is a disposition to promote goods of others rather than one’s own goods when the values of these goods are equal or incommensurable. We argue that possessing this trait makes one more likely to maximize total value, because in addition to promoting the goods of the other, this trait also promotes goods of interpersonal union. We explain why this conclusion is significant, and we defend our argument for it against several objections.",

Apart from being (one way or other) involved in the language, they all would share a demanding requirement – a second mental centre within the subject. This redefinition of the simulationism is extended in the present book in two directions. Firstly, mirror-neurons and, likewise, animal abilities connected with the visual field of their fellows, although they certainly constitute important landmarks, would not require this second mental centre. Secondly, others’ beliefs would have given rise not only to predicative communicative function but also to pre-grammatical syntax. The inquiry about the evolutionary-historic origin of language focuses on the cognitive requirements on it as a faculty (but not to the indirect causes such as environmental changes or greater co-operation), pays attention to children, and covers other human peculiarities as well, e.g., symbolic play, protodeclaratives, self-conscious emotions, and interactional or four-hand tasks.",

Consequently, otherwise normal reactions become overcharged with energy and result in anti-social modes of response, or else less adequate responses are utilized to relieve the tension state. The fault lies in the type of behavior utilized rather than in any fundamental physio-organic disorder.

Nonverbal communication, often called non-verbal behavior or body language, is an instrument of transmitting information, just like a written word. The difference is that it is transmitted through facial expressions, gestures, touches, physical movements, body holding, decoration on the body (clothing, jewelry, hairstyles, tattoos, etc.), and even the volume, tone and colour of certain person voice. Verbal communication is thought to be a better way of presenting the state, thought and feeling, non-verbal communication in its essence should not be underestimated; it is only a more discrete way of expressing emotions and states.",

These disasters have emerged from human choices and decisions, many of them related to standing by and the complicity that goes with that action. Nothing human, natural, or divine guarantees respect for the ethical values and commitments that are most needed in contemporary human existence, but nothing is more important that our commitment to defend them, for they remain as fundamental as they are fragile, as precious as they are endangered. While existence is shot through with failure, ethics remains and persists. An irreplaceable safeguard, it still possesses the indispensable corrective for its own failures. But ethics meets that test only to the degree that it—and we—confront mass atrocities, inspire protest and resistance against them, support humanitarian responses to the suffering inflicted by those crimes, and strengthen efforts to prevent their recurrence.",

      "title": "NEAR‐DEATH EXPERIENCES AND SPIRITUALITY",
      "abstract": "Abstract. Some individuals when they come close to death report having experiences that they interpret as spiritual or religious. These so‐called near‐death experiences (NDEs) often include a sense of separation from the physical body and encounters with religious figures and a mystical or divine presence. They share with mystical experiences a sense of cosmic unity or oneness, transcendence of time and space, deeply felt positive mood, sense of sacredness, noetic quality or intuitive illumination, paradoxicality, ineffability, transiency, and persistent positive aftereffects. Although there is no relationship between NDEs and religious belief prior to the experience, there are strong associations between depth of NDE and religious change after the experience. NDEs often change experiencers' values, decreasing their fear of death and giving their lives new meaning. NDEs lead to a shift from ego‐centered to other‐centered consciousness, disposition to love unconditionally, heightened empathy, decreased interest in status symbols and material possessions, reduced fear of death, and deepened spiritual consciousness. Many experiencers become more empathic and spiritually oriented and express the beliefs that death is not fearsome, that life continues beyond, that love is more important than material possessions, and that everything happens for a reason. These changes meet the definition of spiritual transformation as “a dramatic change in religious belief, attitude, and behavior that occurs over a relatively short period of time.” NDEs do not necessarily promote any one particular religious or spiritual tradition over others, but they do foster general spiritual growth both in the experiencers themselves and in human society at large.",

      "abstract": "The harmonious relation is but short-lived, the traumatic discovery that vitally important parts of it are both independent and inscrutable creates a structure, and from then the world will consist of firm and resistant objects and of spaces separating them. Most of the experiences met in the analytic situations belong to pre-verbal—infantile or regressed—states. One important factor is fear, forcing the patient away from the analyst; another defiance, 'not taking things lying down'; a third, curiosity; a fourth, naughtily testing out the analyst's tolerance, and so on. Objects are skilfully and carefully avoided, while constant watch is kept on them, especially on the most hazardous object, the analyst. The analyst should not be an entity in his own right, with his own ideas, clever suggestions, and profound interpretations, in fact not a separate sharply contoured object at all; but should merge as completely as possible into the 'friendly expanses' surrounding the patient.",

      "title": "Mental Deviance",
      "abstract": "'Mental illness is a metaphor', claims Szasz (1973, p.114), used to cover people who are 'socially deviant or inept, or in conflict with individuals, groups or institutions'. Leaving aside for the moment the issue of the status of medical definitions, this quotation serves to remind us that, legally and historically, what is now regarded as mental disorder is basically the need to deal with a social problem. Such a social problem may be revealed at an individual level, because someone finds that they cannot cope with life in society; or at an interpersonal level, because those with whom they live cannot cope with them; or at a social level, because the agents of some social institution find them socially deviant. Yet the importance of this social situation has often been ignored in attempts to explain the cause of mental deviance in mysticism, malice or madness, and to remove this cause by eradication or cure. We are not suggesting that the causes of mental problems can be ignored; we merely want to stress, particularly to lawyers and social workers, that the form of the problem to be explained can in fact be determined by the nature of these practical situations, and that therefore in different situations there may be different problems to explain.1",
